# Machine Learning for the Arts&Humanities

This repository is part of the course [Machine Learning for the Arts&Humanities](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/490903) at the University of Bologna, master degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge).

*Please note that this repository will be updated continuosly in the future, as new editions of this course are proposed.*

## Datasets and exercises

We will use several **datasets**, available in the [Data folder](data/). 

These datasets include:
* [Applied Data Analysis](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/tree/master/data), various datasets.
* [Computer Vision for the Humanities: An Introduction to Deep Learning for Image Classification](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/computer-vision-deep-learning-pt1) from the Programming Historian series.
* [British Library 19th century books](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS/tree/master/data#british-library-19th-century-books).
* [TopRes19th dataset](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/documentation/README-topres19th.md#topres19th-dataset).

## Setting-up your working environment

Please see the `requirements` file for a list of dependencies. [PyTorch can be installed following these instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Lastly, to setup your working environment, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/Giovanni1085/UNIBO_Programmazione_LM/blob/main/setup.md).

## Book

These materials are in part based on the book *[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)*.
