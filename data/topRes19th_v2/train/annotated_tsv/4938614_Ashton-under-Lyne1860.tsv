#Text=Tame Valley, was engaged, on Wednesday, in cleaning some jennies in one of the rooms he met with a severe accident to his head._ The spinner, who is rather deaf, not knowing that the lad was amongst the machinery, set the jennies going, and being unable to hear the shouts of the lad on account of the defect in his hearing, did not stop them until another man made signs to him to stop, which he did instantly.
