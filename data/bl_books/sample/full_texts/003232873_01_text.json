Breezes are slumbering, Cruel is the sun,\u2014 Shelter is distant far, Shade there is none. Straight is the highway, And rough to the feet ; Verdure is withering \u2014 Scorched' by the heat. Fierce are the sunbeams, And cloudless the sky. Dusty and travel-worn, Hastest thou by? Wilt thou not wander To woodland and glade ? Breezes are soothing there, Soft is the shade. Wilt thou not lay thee By forest-hid pool,\u2014 Moss for thy pillow, And ivy leaves cool ? Faithful and fearless ! Thou scornest to stray. Only the craven ones Falter and stay. Hasten, then, traveller, Still on thy way ! Noontide is fleeing, But yet it is day."], [7, ""], [8, ""]]
