Religion's poison'd ; and she walks about, Not in the bloom of apostolic beauty, Winning poor sinners into happiness, As when she charm'd St Peter and St John ; But bloated with distemp'rature : her face Ugly with passion, and bespotted foul With the green fest'ring boils of heresy, The dagger of damnation in her hand. \u2014 CARDINAL.

I've seen my mother to her couch to rest, And I have said my evening prayers with her ; And now I seek this flow'ry solitude, To entertain my desolated mind With moonlight, and the garden's silent scenes. How beautiful, above the sea, the moon Has lighted up her sky-adorning torch, Dimming th' abashed stars, and paving all The bay's expansion, as with twinkling sheets Of silver fluent on the flutt'ring wave !

The garden, too, is proud, and plumes herself On her fair early flowers, which she expands Full to the moon, as bragging how her brother Has busFd her out, though she regrets not now His absence in his sister's sweeter beams. Welcome, sweet fight, and with thee welcome too Thoughts of divinely-soothing melancholy, That slide, as if by stealth, into the soul, And fill it with a stillness calm as thine ! The day, with all its flashy glaring light, Its brawl of business, shouts, and din of wheels, Is well away and buried in the sea. To me, and to the sorrowful of heart, And to the pious saint, and to the lover, This lonely hour comes on more peace-giving, And more accordant to their museful mood ; For I have been in sorrow all the day,"], [74, "CARDINAL BEATON. 66 ACT II And having wiped my tears, now forth repair To feed with thoughts my meditative heart.

How difTrent, when we took our evening walks By the moon's fight upon the lofty shore, Whence we o'erlook'd the rolling ocean from The sea-marge to the fiery-beacon'd May ! Then how light-hearted in our happiness ! How little boded we our present cares ! Yet there are yet, I hope, good things for us ; He who commands this stillness, and o'erspreads Heaven's changeful face with such a robe of light, Will yet o'erspread our count'nances with joy.

BEATRICE. Yea, Peace must be where Patience is ; and I Can keep my spirit patient and submiss, When God, who gives the grief, requires submission, As sign of acquiescence in his will ; That I can do, and Heaven requires no more. But joy's rich cup, though tender'd to my lips, I cannot, may not taste, but pass it by ; Deferring till a father's doom be clear'd From doubt and danger, which surround it now, The darker from to-day's occurrences.

Oh, hideous heart of cruelty and wrong ! Oh, fiend ! too worthy of thy hate and mine ! Though well to thee I could have prophesied That idle supplication's evil issue. \u2014 He is incensed, not only that thy father Has foster'd what is misnamed heresy, Incurring thence an honourable blot ; But that Balcaskie's house of Strang, whose name You share, with distant consanguinity, Exerts, with all the neighb'ring families, A bold hostility against his power. Thence, as if conscious of conspiracy, He shuts himself in stern relentlessness : But long he cannot rule. Already he O'erplays the tyrant, to his own destruction ; Which hovers now, suspended o^r his head By a thin hair, like Damocles's sword. Some plot is sprouting, and will ripen soon :"], [79, "SCENE IV. CARDINAL BEATON. 71 Events must burst ; and fate can't labour long Against the pressure of necessity. BEATRICE. Yet, Seaton, if this man upon himself Compels destruction from the hands of foes, I cannot bear that thou shouldst be involved In being party to the fate of him, Whom thou had'st reason, for thy damsel's sake, To call and deem a cruel enemy.

I revere thee for that word : Though not the less for thee, and for myself, And for my country, I might well be clear'd, In aiding that the murderer may perish, Who seeks to rid the world of honest men. \u2014 You see how he has summon'd to this city His crowd of minion priests, that swarming come To cause to-morrow perish at the stake A saint, whose vestments are of holiness.

His own devices must entangle him ; His pit, for others dug, must swallow him! BEATRICE. I see the meaning, then, of all this stir And flocking thither of the laity ; Their broils and bickerings with priestly men ; Their scoffs at girdled friars and mitres passing ; Their mutterings and whispers, where they stand In lonely lanes, and corners of the streets, Group'd into gloomy knots, discussing something Mysterious, and of terrible import. Even now, we hear at times the distant sound, As of th' explosion of confined wrath ; Shouts, as of furious quarrellers ; and cries, As of fierce men infuriated with wine, Assaulting, or assaulted in the streets. Such signs, I doubt, betoken some black storm About to agitate this fated town. Yet those have nought to fear, whom love and peace Unite and harmonize in holy joy.
