There is sweet music here that softer falls Than petals from blown roses on the grass, Or night-deius on still ivaters between ivalls Of shadowy granite in a gleaming 2,ass > Music that gentlier on the spirit lies, Tlian tired eyelids upon tired eyes ; Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies. Tennyson. The most common-sense people fall into it sometimes, \u2014 the weakness of dreaming vacantly about nothing in particular. To the majority this only happens in the middle of a hot summer noon, when the hammock sways sleepily in the shade, and the novel drops lazily from the hand ; or, by the fireside, on a chill autumn evening, after a long day of fishing or rowing or tennis, when they have won to B"], [14, "2 THE SHADOW OF A SONG that highest height of happiness, \u2014 to have taken exercise, and have dined, and be smoking. But Jack was a dreamer by constitution. He dreamed as he walked ; he dreamed as he talked ; and, what was more annoying, as he was talked to. Your best stories either were quite unheard, or, being half-heard, had to be repeated. When he changed for exercise, he would often wind up his watch, and was sup posed, on one occasion, to have further got into his bed. Morning, noon, and night ; spring, summer, and winter : Jack treated them all alike. His whole life was a long dream, broken only by lucid intervals of apparently reckless frivolity. He was dreaming now, \u2014 dreaming away in the fresh morning, by a little brook, that tumbled along, close to his feet, over rocks and boulders. The sun was not long risen, and the water danced and sparkled in its light ; while on either side of the stream thousands of tiny gossamers, hanging from fern to fern, glistened with the early dews. Poor Boy ! \u2014 he was not really a boy, but by reason of his nature we always called him one \u2014 I can picture the place as well as if I saw it now : the steep hillsides, covered with"], [15, "3 THE SHADOW OF A SONG trees and stones ; the little stream, running between them and crossed by the little bridge; and, under the oak-tree, the ledge of rock, where the Boy sat, his wondering blue eyes fixed on the moving waters, and brown hair touched into gold by the sunlight which fell through the leaves. The place was suited to a dreamer ; and a noisy little stream is often charged with a burthen of memories. But the Boy was not a sentimental boy : rather, he prided himself on being the opposite ; and just now his thoughts were fixed on quite real and present things. And the stream supplied no more than a 'running' accompaniment. \" I don't quite know why he asked me,\" said the Boy. \" I never cared about him much ; and I should not have thought he cared particularly about me. It hardly matters, I suppose, as I was coming down here anyhow in a couple of days. But it was odd his ask ing me, all the same.\" The stream could offer no suggestion. \" However, Johnson will be there,\" said the Boy: \"which is one comfort. I shall be glad to see old Jonas. It will be rather amusing b 2"], [16, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 4 to be kept in order again. Good old Jonas ! Though Marriot was curiously eager for me to meet him, considering he lives somewhere near here, and I should probably have seen him otherwise. 'Johnson will be staying with us, and you will like to see him.' So I shall : in fact, I should not have come otherwise. I don't quite know why I've come as it is. Curiosity, I suppose.\" The stream made no attempt to solve the difficulty. \" Yes, I wonder,\" said the Boy, \" if any of those stories about Marriot were true. I never met a real swindler in my life before \u2014 at least, not to my knowledge \u2014 and it will be rather interesting. Yes, I'm really glad I came. Of course there may be nothing in them ; and there may be nothing in his asking me here. Still, that's the way the man in the story suffered ; first asked down here, then robbed at cards. My dear Jack ! it may be very interesting.\" The stream covdd express assent in a way, if it could not answer questions. Said the Boy : \" It's rather comic my appear ing at this hour, and not having seen the"], [17, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 5 family yet. But I daresay they're used to that : their friends \u2014 perhaps the man who was robbed himself \u2014 must have come down by the night mail before this. AVhat time did they say breakfast was ? But I can soon get back. The house \u2014 let me see \u2014 would be almost opposite here,\u2014 up there, behind the trees. I wonder what the family consists of: Marriot, and his mother \u2014 he hasn't a father, I know. I wonder if there are any more.\" The stream lapsed into its old hopeless con dition, and ' babbled merely for babble ' ; and Jack forgot gradually all about the Marriots, and their antecedents, and the rest of the problem, which he had already analysed and re-analysed through the night, under the dim railway-lamp, to the monotonous clang and beat of the wheels. It was pleasant, after the long hours spent in a stifling carriage, to sit in the cool shade of trees by a fresh little brook. Jack felt a vague sense of delight in watching the water as it went along, falling with foam over the boulders, or pouring between them, or flowing smoothly in a deep eddying pool, dark with peat from the moors. And there was something"], [18, "6 THE SHADOW OF A SONG refreshing in the mere way those ferns and the leaves of those lower branches dipped into the cool stream. And ' the noise of many waters ' \u2014Jack half closed his eyes, to feel how pleasant it all was. What a number of odd catches of old songs a little stream will learn in the course of its passage down from the hills ! It is hard to be by one for a few minutes without its suggest ing some remembered melody, and ' piping to the spirit ditties of no tone.' Jack went through five or six as he sat there, looking and listening, \u2014 most of them favourite melodies, some of them rather intricate, which the stream had learnt. There was one especially in which it ap peared to take delight. Jack did not remember where or when he had heard the thing itself before ; but he must have heard something of the kind, or he would not have understood it. For such is the way of a little brook : it will only sing to those who know. Whatever this music was, it had a soothing sort of wail in it which made you wish to remain where you were. The stream resigned the rest in its favour, and dwelt on it as on a thing it loved."], [19, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG Now the melody stole low and soft ; now it swelled out clearer and more full ; now sank again into a whisper, lower, though not less clear : but, high or low, with always the same weird and running wail. And the Boy sat still in a half-doze of pleasure, and listened. The song flowed on and on, shaping itself more accurately, growing ever more precise and definite. Presently the Boy realised that he was listening no longer to the spirit-melodies of the water, but to the objective reality of a human voice. At the same time his ear caught the light crackling of twigs, such as might be made by someone corning down the hillside opposite. He listened. The music descended gradually lower and lower ; sometimes pausing for a minute, as though the singer stopped from time to time to choose a footing or note some object by the way. It was sung too softly for him to hear the words ; but it sounded weirder now than ever, and he seemed surer now that somehow he knew its meaning, \u2014 as if he had heard the thing in some past state of existence. Lower it came and lower ; and the Boy sat"], [20, "8 THE SHADOW OF A SONG listening to it with a kind of charmed expect ancy, as if he could not move. It was close now to the water's edge. The bushes parted ; and a tall lady in grey stood before him on the other bank. She might have been beautiful : he believed afterwards that she was. He had some vague idea of a face over-pale and of dark hair, a little disordered by the breeze. But at the time he could see nothing but her eyes ; which met his own, and held them, as it were, fas cinated. The lady had ceased singing as she saw him ; and, after a momentary look of surprise, she turned again, and disappeared among the trees. The Boy sat gazing at the place where she had vanished. A passing cloud threw a cold shadow upon the stream. The spell was broken ; and he rose, with a little shudder, from his seat."], [21, "CHAPTER II. J know a maiden, fair to see: Take care ! beware '. She can both false and friendly be : Beware ! take care ! Longfellow (from Heine . \" Behold, this dreamer \u2014 cometh at last.\" Jack looked up. He had got back to the house without noticing it. The lady's song had kept him company across the bridge and up through the wood ; and the lady's eyes had looked out at him from behind every bush and tree. Truly, a long night-journey by train is a very tiring thing. A stoutish little man, with a large oval face and grizzled hair and beard, was standing upon the balcony. His elbows rested upon the parapet ; and with head on one side, sup ported by a little hand, he quietly watched Jack's approach. It was Mr. Johnson, the mutual friend. \" I suppose you know,\" continued Mr."], [22, "10 THE SHADOW OF A SONG Johnson, \" that you've been \u2014 keeping everyone waiting for breakfast \u2014 about half an hour ? \" \" Good morning, Jonas. No : that's very interesting. But aren't you pleased to see me ?\" \" Not particularly,\" said Mr. Johnson. \" Suppose you come in now,\u2014 and let us begin breakfast ? we've been \u2014 waiting long enough.\" Just then Marriot stepped out on to the balcony, and the Boy's whole attention went to him as they exchanged greetings. Jack remembered his face well \u2014 the red rimmed eyes of a nondescript hue, in which a greeny-brown predominated ; the high, fleshy cheek-bones ; the sandy hair. He had taken to a small imperial ; and his dress was even neater than of old. Otherwise everything was the same as before those stories went abroad concerning him. He was not bad to look upon : his intimate acquaintances \u2014 he had no friends \u2014 thought him handsome ; but the general absence of colour and character, especially in the eyes, left a sense of some thing wanting. \"Don't mention it,\" said he, as Jack made his apologies for being late. \" I hope you're"], [23, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 11 not done up with your journey, old fellow. It's deuced good of you to come to such an outlandish place at such short notice.\" He was always a polite man, was Marriot. A nervous-looking little lady rose from the end of the table as they entered, whom Marriot introduced as his mother. \" Elsie,\" he added, turning to another lady in the room, \" this is Mr. Helston.\" Jack had forgotten for the minute his foolish fancies. They came back upon him now with a rush ; and he bowed lower than necessary, to conceal them. \" I think I saw Mr. Helston by the stream this morning,\" he heard someone saying as he took a seat assigned him opposite. The Boy made an inarticulate answer, which did not improve matters. But the Boy felt tired, and was not ready with his phrases. Fortunately, others took charge of the con versation. Mr. Johnson was discussing a coming voyage to Norway. Mr. Johnson could tell the names of the ships on most lines, and the dates of their sailing, and the names of their captains : with whom he was on terms"], [24, "12 THE SHADOW OF A SONG of familiarity; and the best hotels to put up at in the different places. Mr. Johnson was also skilled in descriptions of scenery, knowing well the right adjectives to use about the sunset and the lakes and hills, and about Nature generally in all her times and seasons ; while Marriot showed a great interest in Mr. Johnson's plans, and a quite friendly anxiety to know when he woidd return : for he was a polite man. And Mrs. Marriot main tained an intermittent fire of queries upon side issues. Then Marriot suggested that they should fish that morning. He had some important letters to write, by-the-bye. So, if the others would excuse him, they had better go down to the water first : Johnson knew the way ; and Marriot would join them later. All this the Boy remembered afterwards. During the meal, his attention was occupied in selecting between \" Yes \" and \" No \" as answer to interrogations on his journey and remarks about the weather, inserted by the little lady into the thick of the conversa tion. \" How long are you staying, Jonas ? \" said"], [25, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 13 Jack, as they walked across the lawn ; for he was feeling himself again. \" Oh, I'm \u2014 off this afternoon,\" said Mr. Johnson. \" Off this afternoon ! Why, I thought you were making a long visit. I was asked on purpose to meet you. I'm not driving you away, am I, Jonas ? \" :' No, \u2014 you're not driving me away. \u2014 I don't think about children when I make my plans.\" Mr. Johnson laughed shortly as he spoke, and walked on in silence. That was not really the sort of man he was; but Mr. Johnson had a mission to per- form : to wit, the suppression of frivolity. It fared not much worse than other missions. Two godfathers and one godmother had pro- mised to answer for him as Johnson, \u2014 Henry Bowyer Johnson : but the spirit of the age had shortened this to ' Old Jonas,' or even (forgive, great gods and pedagogues !) ' the Joner.' It was the Boy who had fashioned most of these terms, and thereby put the inter- course of grown men, when he was present, upon this absurd footing ; but he himself only used them between inverted commas, and to"], [26, "14 THE SHADOW OF A SONG annoy his fellows ; and had once even attacked the system in verse, bristling with the worst puns : thus \u2014 ' That Harrowing speech, which from the righteous path Of proper names and nouns continual]}' Goes 'er '-ring into a waste wilderness Of 'Joner,'\" and so forth. And the Boy himself responded to nearly as many forms of address as did that man who pursued the Snark. And some times even Mr. Johnson had been known to use the same. After dinner, for instance \u2014 . But that, as they say in India, is another story. Presently the Boy resumed : \" But really, Jonas, joking apart, are j'ou really going this afternoon ? I was asked to meet you.\" \" Really \u2014 and joking apart \u2014 I'm going this afternoon.\" \" Then I must run up to the house a minute,\" said the Boy. \" I've left my fly-book in the breakfast-room. Don't wait for me, Jonas. I shall not be long.\" Jack had glanced fruitlessly round the room, and was just going out, when he was"], [27, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 15 aware of someone speaking in the conserv atory, which led out of it on the left. \" Why, don't you think I've chosen you a good subject ? \" said a voice. \" Perhaps you have,\" answered another voice ; and after a pause, during which the Boy deliberated whether he should inquire about his book or not : \" I tell you what it is, Bertie : I don't like it. I've said I would, and so I will. But remember: it is the last time.\" \" No harm will come of it,\" persisted the first voice. \"It's hardly worth while going through that again,\" the other voice interrupted ; and there was the sound of a step approaching the conservatory door. The Boy thought better of his question now. He slipped into the hall, and ran up the stairs to his room. The fly-book seemed to have vanished. Jack searched everywhere : in his portman teau, on his dressing-table, among the clothes thrown upon his bed: for he was not tidy, and allowed for that. But the book had vanished; and, after turning over the same"], [28, "16 THE SHADOW OF A SONG things several times, he prepared to try the breakfast-room again. As he reached the first landing, a door opened softly at the head of the stairs. Mar riot came out. He looked slightly discon certed on seeing Jack, but merely remarked : \" Hullo, Helston ! I thought you were down at the water. My correspondence is nearly finished. Don't trouble to wait : I'll join you at the stream presently.\" Jack came down into the hall: and there was the missing fly-book, lying straight before him on the hall-table ; where he now remem bered he had laid it. \" Now, I wonder what they meant, Marriot and his sister,\" thought the Boy to himself, as he hurried back to Mr. Johnson. \" It would be rather amusing if it was really to be the card business over again. I'm afraid there wouldn't be much to get out of me, if they succeeded. But it's all nonsense ; it can't be that. Mar riot's important correspondence, by the way, seems to leave him time for holding long dis cussions with his family and perambulating aimlessly about the house. She isn't much like her brother.\" Which was a little irrelevant."], [29, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 17 Mr. Johnson was waiting for him on the bridge. Found it ? \" he inquired, as Jack came uP- Found what ? \" said Jack. \"I thought you'd gone back \u2014 for your fly book,\" said Mr. Johnson, severely. \" Oh yes, my fly-book,\" said Jack. \" Yes, I did go back for that. Yes, I found my fly book. Here it is.\" He produced it in support of his statement. Mr. Johnson muttered something which Avas not kind about being absent-minded, and dreamy, and unpractical. Suddenly, as they picked their way along the stream, he halted and faced the Boy. \" Look here, young man,\" he said ; \" you wanted \u2014 to knoAv when I was going. There's something \u2014 much more important than that :\u2014 when are you going ? \" It was Mr. Johnson's habit always to speak in jerks and pauses. This took no longer than the ordinary way ; and it was much more impressive. \" To-morrow afternoon,\" said the Boy, \" if you'll allow me, Jonas. Uncle Tylor's coming to morrow, you know ; and he and I thought (if c"], [30, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 18 you didn't mind, Jonas) of fishing here for a few weeks. Marriot has taken rooms for us in a cottage near here.\" \u00abOh,\u2014 Tylor's coming to-morrow?\" said Mr. Johnson. \" I forgot. Marriot \u2014 doesn't know Tylor, does he ? \" He hesitated a minute ; and continued: \"Well\u2014 you take my advice, young man,\u2014 and clear out of this as soon as you can.\" Then he proceeded solemnly upon his way again. \" But why ? \" said Jack, catching him up. \" Never mind why,\" said Mr. Johnson. \" You take the advice\u2014 of an older man than yourself: and go.\" By and bye he added\u2014 for wayward youth will not accept commands unsupported by reasons even from the old and experienced\u2014 \" Well, they're\u2014 they're \"\u2014(his voice lowered to a half-whisper)\u2014\" well, to tell the truth, they're a lot of gamblers\u2014 a lot of swindlers.\u2014 Now you have it ! \" The Boy looked at Mr. Johnson. He wanted to know more. \" That's rather strong, isn't it, Jonas ? Can't you give a poor fellow some proof ? \" \" I know it,\" said Mr. Johnson, impressively;"], [31, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 19 \" I know it, \u2014 and that's enough. \u2014 Oh, there's no doubt about it. \u2014 The matter got into the papers once.\" Jack admitted having seen it. He was silent a minute. Then he said: \" Hoav is it you trusted yourself into the lion's mouth, Jonas ? \" \" Oh, \u2014 I had some business to do with Marriot. Besides \u2014 I'm a gynanthrope.\" \"A gyn \u2014 ? Ah yes, I remember: a miso gynist. That dear old joke of yours, Jonas ! But what has that got to do Avith the ques tion ? \" \" It's \u2014 got everything to do with it,\" said Mr. Johnson. \" You don't \u2014 think Marriot could do it all by himself. No : there's a stronger agent at Avork there than Marriot ; and \u2014 you're just the sort of inflammable young person Avho Avould be caught.\" The Boy thought of the conversation in the conservatory. But, being young and con trary, he could not allow Mr. Johnson to think he had influenced him, \u2014 though he knew the advice was given as from friend to friend. Moreover, to speak the truth, he Avas curious \u25a0from a purely speculative point of vieAv, of c 2"], [32, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 20 course \u2014 to examine the matter further. And if there was any danger in the investigation, why, the danger Avas the least little bit in the world attractive : that Avas all. So he remained by his guns, and said : \"Well, Jonas, you're an enormously good felloAv ; and you may consider me your slave through life, Jonas. All the same, you knoAv, I don't see hoAv I can get away before Uncle Tylor comes, unless I slip out at night by the back-door, Avith my bag in my hand, or dis guise myself and go off Avith you as your valet.\" [Mr. Johnson made a gesture, as Avho Avould say, ' Heaven forbid ! '] \"And you wouldn't haA'e me do that, Jonas, would you ? It Avould be undignified : and I'm nothing if not dignified, am I, Jonas ? \" [Mr. Johnson shrugged his shoulders in the Avay Avhich shows contempt.] \" Then I couldn't very well have a telegram sent to say my aunt Avas dead. Marriot Avouldn't even ' Avish that it were a nearer relation.' He'd see through it at once, and he'd consider him self insulted. And a man of your courtesy wouldn't have me insult anyone, Avould you, Jonas ? And then think Iioav Nuncle Avould be put out, \u2014 Uncle Tylor. No, I must take"], [33, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 21 my life in my hand, and risk it. I should have to be in the neighbourhood, if I Avasn't in the house. Besides,\" said the Boy, \" I'm a bit of a misogynist myself. You and I are quite safe, aren't Ave, Jonas ? \" He nudged Mr. Johnson in the side Avith his elboAv. Mr. Johnson winced. Just a little too much, perhaps. But he hit the right ' laAv of gravity,' as he ansAvered : \" Well, I've said \u2014 all I've got to say. If you take my advice, you'll get out of this \u2014 as soon as jrou can \u2014 not only out of the house \u2014 but out of the neighbourhood \u2014 altogether.\" Mr. Johnson had spoken. As he finished he replaced his pipe in his mouth ; and when Mr. Johnson did this, it Avas generally felt that a discussion Avas at an end. \" You fellows seem to be having good sport,\" said a voice from the bank. They had neither of them made a single cast. \" Trying to talk the fish over ? \" continued Marriot, coming towards them. \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"in a Avay. We've been arguing about a ' fly.' \" But he belie\\red that Marriot had overheard their argument, or that he suspected at least the nature of it."], [34, "22 THE SHADOW OF A SONG It Avas noAV that the fishing really began. At least, for tAvo of them. For, if Jack had been there alone, the fish Avould have had an easy morning. J ack was considering ; Jack Avas thinking of his supposed danger. And so effective was Mr. Johnson's advice that, by the time they had left the Avater and Avere climb ing the hill again, Jack had come to the con clusion he Avould not have gone aAvay from the house a minute before it Avas necessary, if telegrams had arrived announcing the sudden end of half the minor relatives he possessed throughout the length and breadth of the Avhole land.

But Gip turned aAvay, and thrust his nose against the Boy's hand. Just then Elsie Marriot appeared. \" Here you are ! \" she said. \" I hope you have had a good morning.

He Avas Avondering Avhy he had been the victim of such foolish ideas that morning. Jack found this meal easier than the last. He even talked a little, and that Avhen he Avas not addressed. Gip seemed some how to have smoothed the Avay; but Mr. Johnson looked troubled Avith some misgiving. \" Have you had good sport, Mr. Melsom ? \" asked the little lady. \" Helston,\" said Marriot severely. \" Did you have good sport, Mr. Helsom ? \" \" Mr. Helston, mother \u2014 not Mr. Helsom,\" said Elsie, laughing. \" Mother's not very good at names : are you, mother ?

But I expect it was my OAvn fault ; the others did v7ery Avell.\" \" He's \u2014 an absent-minded felloAv, this youngster,\" remarked Mr. Johnson. \"He was"], [36, "24 THE SHADOW OF A SONG dreaming all the time.

So Jack Avas alone, and face to face Avith his danger. And the Avorst of it Avas, the trouble of the morning Avas coming on him afresh ; and, as the day Avore on, it became more and more active, till, Avhen the gong sounded for dinner, he felt that he Avas again to be the plaything of his OAvn fancies. Only one point Avas clear to him as he Avent doAArn to the draAving-room, \u2014 that he Avas in no wise thank ful to Mr. Johnson for his suggestions, and that he must bear the matter noAV as best he might. \" I do hope Mr. Johnson will have a calm voyage to Sweden,\" said the little lady, as they sat at dinner."], [41, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 29 To Nonvay, \" said Marriot. \" To Norway,\" continued the little lady. \" I'm ahvays so afraid Avhen I think of people going these long voyages. Have you ever been a long voyage, Mr. Helsom ? \" \" Once,\" said Jack, \" Avhen I came from the West Indies.\" \" And Avhen you Avent out there, I sup- pose ? \" \"And Avhen I went out there,\" said Jack. \" I thought my brother told me you Avere born there, Mr. Helston ? \" said Elsie. \" Born there ? \" said Jack. \" Yes, I Avas born there.\" Then he became angry, and prepared to explain. But the little lady did not leave him the opportunity. \"Really?\" she said, \"really, Mr. Helsom? Born in the West Indies ? That's very in teresting, isn't it, Elsie ? Why, these tAvo children Avere born abroad as Avell, Mr. Helsom, \u2014 in Italy, you knoAv ; born, and educated there, too, till Bertie went to Oxford. And I remember when we came back to England, \u2014 I shall never forget that voyage : it was most dreadfully rough. The captain himself said he had never seen it so rough before.\""], [42, "30 THE SHADOW OF A SONG \" Captains generally do say that,\" remarked Marriot ; \" except Avhen they say it's a mere cat's-paw.\" \" Elsie didn't mind it in the very least,\" continued the little lady. \" I don't believe you knoAv Avhat fear is, Elsie. The Avaves Avere perfectly enormous, and the ship turned on to its side, till you could see the keel.\" \" My dear mother ! \" said Marriot. Elsie appeared occupied Avith her OAvn thoughts. \" Yes, Bertie, actually see the keel. I assure you it's a fact, Mr. Helsom. Bertie was most dreadfully bad, \u2014 not with fear, you know. I Avas bad Avith fear. I thought the vessel was going doAvn ev7ery minute. But Bertie said, ' I only wish it Avould ! ' Do you remember saying that, Bertie ? \" \"We've heard that story so often, mother. said Marriot, testily. This silenced the little lady for a time ; but it Avas obvious she was folloAving up her reminiscences. Presently she began again : \"Don't you remember that girl, Bertie, who came on board with the old chaperone at Gib?\" \u2014 [Marriot tried to break in again, but failed] \u2014 \"and that horrid Mr. Murray, Avho Avas so epris"], [43, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 31 of her ? How well you copied his handwriting, Bertie ! and how angry she was ! It quite makes me laugh to think of it noAV. He's an extraordinary copyist, Mr. Helsom. What Avas it you said, Bertie ? ' Dearest lady ' \" \" Mother ! \" said Marriot, rudely. His bile had been rising during the narrative : he could keep it doAvn no longer. \" I am sure these silly stories cannot interest Mr. Helston.\" Whereon the little lady retired into herself ; nor did she occur again for the rest of dinner. \" Once the mother gets on the Avar-path,\" Marriot explained to Jack, Avhen the ladies Avere gone, \" there's no stopping her. One has to speak rather sharply to her sometimes.\" Jack Avould have liked very much to kick Marriot. But he only said dryly, \" I see.\" Said Marriot presently: \"Johnson seems to be a great chum of yours.\" \" Yes, I suppose he is,\" said Jack. \" SaAv a good deal of him at Oxford, I sup pose ? \" said Marriot. \" He Avas senior to me,\" said Jack, \" and he read science. But Ave Avere both scholars, and sat at the same table. But I've hardly seen anything of him since he came down.\""], [44, "32 THE SHADOW OF A SONG \" He lives near Pilchester,\" observed Marriot, \" all alone Avith an old nurse \u2014 sort of heirloom of the family \u2014 Avho Avatched over the infancy of Johnson ptre, and possibly grandpere, and sees that Johnson doesn't blow himself up in his laboratory. But he's generally gallivanting about in foreign climes.\" Jack said \" Yes \" ; and the other continued : \" He's a junior partner in the Pilchester Bank \u2014 rather a sleeping partner: gives most of his time when he's here \u2014 Avhich isn't much \u2014 to his amateur researches. You knoAV the place, I suppose ? \" Jack confessed that he did not. \" Oh, you couldn't miss it.\" [Jack looked at him in surprise.] \" I mean \u2014 you remember the Avay you came here through the Avoods from the station ? The bank is a large red brick building on the left, just before you get to the station.\" The locality and appearance of the Pilchester Bank Avas, at any rate, not more interesting to Jack than the little lady's anecdotes of life on board the storm-tossed steamer. So the conversation dropped ; and Marriot presently suggested a move to the draAving-room."], [45, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 33 The little lady was nervously knitting in the corner of the room. Miss Marriot was reading in an arm-chair, with the St. Bernard lying at her feet : Avho greeted Jack with a lazy Avag of the tail. Jack Avas not going to be beaten by his silly fancies. So he took a seat next to her ; and, stroking the dog to help him, began : \"Is that one of George Sand's, Miss Marriot ? \" Jack had neA^er read anything of George Sand's in his life. But the lady had. And discoursed upon them as one Avho kneAv. (Her voice Avas good to listen to.)

Yes, he did. (The eyes, by-the-bye, Avere not so hard-looking as he had thought them.) And her ' Dosia ' ? Yes, he kneAv. that too. Odd that Avomen should be so good as novelists : in England, perhaps, especially. Of course the giantess, George Eliot ; but others as well besides her, \u2014 Mrs. Burnett, for instance.

Had nearly forgotten to men tion her favourite, Olive Schreiner. He hadn't read her ' African Farm ' ? Oh, then, he must. She would lend it him. He mustn't judge it too hastily : disgracefully inartistic and hope lessly unnatural, but extraordinarily powerful and extraordinarily pathetic. Was afraid there Avas one authoress they Avould not agree about \u2014 hardly dared mention her name : it Avas such a sign of bad taste \u2014 that little minx, Charlotte Bronte. He really disliked her too, did he ? She Avas so very affected \u2014 quite comic, in fact. Did he Iuioav the parody, ' Miss Mix ' ? The lady laughed. Jack laughed too. Partly, because her laughter Avas pleasant to hear. Partly, to think what Mr. Johnson Avould haA-e said, if he could have seen him iioav. \" You tAvo seem to be having a very amusing conversation over there,\" said the little lady. Jack started back into himself. Elsie froze suddenly. \" What do you say to some cards ? '' said the little lady. Thought Jack : \" Noav it's coming \" ; and the Eyes and the Song began again. But, to his surprise, Marriot broke in :"], [47, "35 THE SHADOW OF A SONG \" Oh no, mother : Ave Avon't have cards. I don't think Mr. Helston cares for cards.\" He had been occupied Avith the daily paper; but had looked up noAV and again at Jack and Elsie. Jack remembered this now. \" Elsie, sing us something, Avon't you ? \" con tinued Marriot. \" Will you sing us something, Miss Marriot ? \" said Jack, abstractedly. Elsie hesitated, and said, \" I don't think I'll sing this evening, thanks.\" Marriot looked angry, and Avent across and said something to her. \" Oh, very Avell ; if you like,\" said Elsie. The hard look Avas there once more. Jack got up to open the piano. \" I shan't Avant that, thank you, Mr. Helston.\" She Avent to a box against the Avail ; from which she took a zither. She placed the zither on a little table, and proceeded to tune it. Jack Avatched her with interest. Somehow, a zither, he thought, Avas more in keeping Avith the scene than a piano. She had the sort of face Mrs. Cameron Avould have chosen n 2"], [48, "36 THE SHADOW OF A SONG to photograph, after first posing her as Clytaemnestra, or Sappho, or someone else Avho Avas Greek and had a will of her oavii, and did things out of the ordinary: \u2014 not the kind of face you Avould expect to see in the draAving-room of a country house. But, as for the coming song, Jack Avas not concerned in it. He had only heard people play light, quick, Hungarian ditties upon the zither, and thought the instrument no better than an elaborate banjo. Noav, in a sad, pathetic song the timbre of the zither will send thrills doAvn the back of a listener as Avell as will the music of many instruments. Jack did not knoAV this then. He knew it a little later. Presently she struck a feAV chords. \" Oh, not that horrid thing ! \" cried the little lady. Elsie paused an instant. Then she said : \"Very well, mother. What Avould you like?\" Then Marriot became quite excited. \" What nonsense, mother ! \" he said angrily. \" The mother must endure it for once, Elsie. I particularly Avant Mr. Helston to hear it.\" \" What is the name of the song ? \" said"], [49, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 37 Jack. This Avas by way of throwing oil on the Avaters. It had that effect. Whether it was some hoAV the sound of Jack's voice, or the nature of the question, or Avhatever the reason may have been, Elsie dreAv herself tog-ether Avithout looking at him ; and there was an unpleasant ring in her voice as she said : '\"The Mesmerist.'\" That was all she said. Then she began a sort of introduction, picking out the melody Avith a little steel spur upon the thumb of her right hand. Jack started in his chair. It Avas the song he had heard that morning by the stream. The St. Bernard looked up at him in stupid sur prise : rose, shook himself, and, stalking across to his mistress, settled doAvn awkwardly by her side. Jack never forgot that scene : the little lady, nervously knitting in her corner ; Marriot, intently reading his paper ; the singer, sitting before her zither, Avith the huge dog lying at her feet; Jack himself, \u2014 he Avas as someone else and part of his oavii picture, \u2014 staring at the singer in hopeless amaze. Jack did not like it at all."], [50, "38 THE SHADOW OF A SONG The song began with a kind of insinuating sweetness. \" With music immaterial, undefined ; Music, whose numbers charm the ear, and bind The limbs, and, with their wizard minstrelsy, Fetter the unlovely fancies of the mind ; \" Music, whose haunting harmonies benumb The senses in oblivion, and make dumb The outspoken bitterness of mournful lips : With music of the zither, lo, I come. \" Hast thou a sorrow that thou would'st forget 1 Hast thou a trouble that doth Avear and fret The sleepless silence of unrestful nights, Dealt long ago, but Avell remembered yet ? \" Then it changed to another key. The sing-er seemed to become more wrapt in her singing ; and there was an intense look in her eyes. Jack shifted in his seat. \"Look deep into mine eyes, and lose therein Ev'n all thy soul, and, losing, surely win Utter forgetfulness and utter peace From self and all that is to self akin. \" Look deep, look deep : lo, I am close to thee, Mine eyes to thine ; look deep, look deep, and see Their depths more deep and more pellucid growing : Look deep, and all thy being merge in me.\""], [51, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 39 Jack thought They had turned towards himself. But his vision had become rather misty ; and he wasn't sure. Anyhow, he did not feel at all comfortable. \"Ah, the spell works ! \u2014 thine eyes all glassy shine ; Short is thy breath, and moist that brow of thine : Not more a linnet is the charmed snake's, A moth the basilisk's, than thou art mine : \" Mine, thy last drop of blood, thy latest breath ; All thy heart imageth ; all thy tongue saith ; All thy hand doeth, morning, noon, and eve : Mine, mine, through all thy life ; and mine in death ! \" The song had got louder ; and in the final stanza sustained itself at its highest pitch in one monotonous, expressionless, tuneless re citative ; then sank, Avith the last line, into a distant concentrated Avhisper. The room swam before Jack's eyes. There was dead silence for a minute Avhen the song had finished. No one seemed to care about it. The little lady had forgotten her knitting. Marriot made no more pretence of reading the paper. While poor Jack, \u2014 he kneAv Avhat Orestes must have felt like, after hear ing the Binding Song of the Holy Ones at Athens,"], [52, "40 THE SHADOW OF A SONG Then Marriot said : \" Thanks very much, Elsie.\" And the little lady said: \"Hoav can you sing that horrid thing, Elsie? I declare it makes me feel quite uncomfortable. It's Avorse than that dreadful Schumann's ' Erl Konig.' \" She meant Schubert's : but no one felt in a mood for correcting her. And Jack said nothing ; but got up and stood against the mantel-piece, Avhile the singer returned to her seat. The room had cleared again noAV. Especially, he could see his Avay to reviling himself. When he had done this thoroughly, he remarked: \" You don't really believe in all this, do you, Miss Marriot ? \" He spoke in contempt ; but he felt as if he Avere less arguing than pleading Avith her. \" In all Avhat ? \" said Elsie. Her voice had a tired sound. \" Why, that one person has such poAver as that over another ? \" \" Yes, I think I do. Jack Avas silent for a minute. He didn't believe in ' things ' \u2014 i.e., in what people do believe in, Avho are inclined to believing, such as"], [53, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 41 ghosts, and thought-reading, and table-turning, and a priori theories of knowledge and of the moral laAvs. He Avas a materialist from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet : con sidered mind to be 'a function of matter ' ; talked about ' suggested,' and ' associated,' and ' dominant ' ideas ; and so on. Above all, he thought that he had threshed out Mesmerism, and established it on a material and ' subject ive ' basis. He called it ' Hypnotism,' or some thing else ending in ' -ism ' ; and believed that any other theory must dissolve into the air, Avhen the cold light of reason Avas turned upon it. So he tried again : \" I thought that theory had been exploded long ago,\" he said, \"Avith its attendant beliefs that light Avas to be seen streaming from the fingers of the mesmerist, and the rest of it. Why, didn't someone prove that you could mes merise yourself by placing any bright disc \u2014 a threepenny-bit, for instance \u2014 at a certain position in front of the eyes ? \" \" Mr. Braid of Manchester, you mean ? \" said the lady. Others seemed to have dabbled in the subject, too. \" Yes,\" said Jack. \"And recent investigation"], [54, "42 THE SHADOW OF A SONG has gone further still, and proved that it needn't even be anything bright, as long as it is placed rather above and rather near the eyes, so that they're strained and fatigued by looking at it. In fact, the result is entirely due to a physical exhaustion of the eyes.\" \" You mustn't rely too much,\" said the lady, \" on the experiments of the Salpetriere school. They are entirely confined to hysterical sub jects.\" Jack Avasn't sure that others had not even gone deeper into the matter than he had. So he disregarded the remark, and continued : \" Well, if this is so, when anyone is Avhat is called ' mesmerised,' the condition is due not to something in the operator, but to something in the subject. This has been the tendency of scientific investigation from the very begin ning : to get the thing more and more out of the objective and put it more and more into the subjective\"; [\"Good Avords, 'objective' and ' subjective,' \" thought Jack] \u2014 \"and, in the subject, to make it ultimately a physical, rather than a mental, condition. And this change of view has been considered important enough to call for a neAv name for the science on its"], [55, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 43 subjective and physical basis,\u2014' Hypnotism.' So, if the Avhole thing depends on the ' mesmeree,' I don't see hoAv one person can have any such power over another.\" The lady smiled. Jack did not like that smile. \" I don't think you have quite explained it all,\" she said. \" If it depends so entirely on the ' mesmeree,' 1ioav is it that one person can mesmerise with ease, another only Avith difficulty or not at all ? You will not deny, I suppose, that such is the case ? \" She looked at him as she spoke. It Avas, perhaps, unconscious; but Jack admitted the strength of the argument. He made up for a failing confidence in his position by an additional Avarnith in his speech. \" I don't see that that alters the case at all,\" he said, almost angrily. \" One person may mesmerise more easily than another, just as one speaker in everyday life holds the attention more readily than another speaker. But the effect is subjective, all the same. And it is largely due to the mass of imagination and superstition that has attached itself to the Avhole idea of mesmerism. You spoke of the difference in the"], [56, "44 THE SHADOW OF A SONG mesmeriser: you forget the difference in the mesmeree : it is just the most imaginative and the most superstitious persons Avho are most easily mesmerised. Not only so,\" he added, growing more heated as he Avent on, \" but there is no genuine recorded instance of anyone, imaginative or othenvise, being mesmerised, Avithout being somehoAv previously made aware of the mesmeriser's intention or presence. And, if that does not prove that it depends on the mesmeree, I don't knoAv Avhat does.\" \"And all the phenomena of mesmerism,\" said the lady, quietly \u2014 \"the subject obeying the Avill of the operator ; thinking black is white and SAveet bitter; seeing, and hearing, and doing, only what he is ordered, even \u2014 even when the trance is past, and then forgetting all about it, if he is so ordered ; \u2014 in fact, all subordination, and so-called ' in hibition,' of faculties generally : \u2014 Avould you explain all this in the same way, as purely ' subjective ? ' \" \" Certainly,\" said Jack, decidedly. \" He falls into the sleep under the impression that he is to obey a certain person ; and he is after wards governed by that idea, that 'dominant"], [57, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 45 idea,' that original suggestion. But it all starts with himself.\" \"You may be right,\" said the lady; \"though your theory requires some expansion to cover all the cases. But, after all, there is still room left for objective influence in the back ground, isn't there ? Every feeling \u2014 fear, plea sure, delight, horror \u2014 is ' subjective,' or it Avouldn't be feeling : but one person can pro duce the feeling, and another cannot. Take the case of your good and bad speakers. The good speaker chains your interest. You may say that that feeling is 'subjective.' You may also say that the feeling differs in intensity, according to the imaginativeness of the audi ence. But the good speaker produces the feeling, and the bad does not. Might it not be so also Avith the mesmeriser ? \"But there,\" said the lady, \"my mother is making preparations to depart ; and Bertie's yaAvning over his neAvspaper. Even our con versation fails to interest him.\" (This Avas said with a bitterness Avhich the subject hardly seemed to Avarrant.) \" You may be right. \u2014 I hope you are,\" said the lady sud denly. \"Good-night, Mr. Helston.\""], [58, "46 THE SHADOW OF A SONG This coiwersation did the opposite of lessen ing the effect of the Binding Song, \u2014 that was Avhat the Boy now named it in his thoughts.

He was expecting something, and waiting for some thing ; but he did not Ioioav what it was. Presently, as in the morning, the noise of the stream changed into the music of the Mes merist's Song; and through the mist he saAv the singer looking at him and signing to him to follow.

His guide was"], [59, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 47 gone ; and he Avas alone. Grinning faces, that Avore the form and features of Marriot, gib bered upon him Avith a fiendish glee.

He hurried toAvards them Avith outstretched arms. But the vision even as he reached it, vanished before him with a cry of pain. He grasped only at dis solving shadows, and found himself falling through infinite depths of darkness, for ever falling and falling. Jack started from his bed in terror, and Avent to the open windoAv. Dawn Avas just breaking. Hosts of birds Avere chirruping and chattering in the branches ; and far below he heard the distant murmur of the little stream. Fresh deAV glistened upon the grass. The keen air of the morning restored his senses. But Jack had had enough of sleep for one night. He dressed, and sat down by the Avindow. A book lay open upon the table. He took it up and began to read."], [60, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 48 The book was a copy of Coleridge's Poems ; and it was open at the end of ' Christabel.'

He had a vague feeling of having done something disloyal ; insomuch that the shadow of the Song, instead of being exorcised by this treatment, settled down upon him the more heavily. He Avas not a very lively companion in those days ; but fishing, as fortune has it, does not require, or even tolerate, sustained conversation. All that is necessary is that there should be a sympathetic someone, to Avhom you feel that you can talk, if you are so inclined.

So Jack could satisfy all requirements of the case without doing further violence to his OAvn feelings than one might do, Avho sought only to pose before another as some half animated and semi -responsive lay-figure or plane of offence. During the day they fished. \u2014 Once, indeed, Tylor had an idea ; and they Avent for a long drive across the moors in Mr. Sleights' little trap, draAvn by Mr. Sleights' little pony, Avhich stopped naturally at anything in the nature of a public-house Avithin a radius of ten miles round Mr. Sleights' little cottage. And Tylor Avas so much pleased Avith this drive that he decided thereupon that it was the right thing to do tAvice or three times a Aveek, at least. But he never proposed the plan again. During the evening, Tylor talked and told anecdotes, most of Avhich Jack had often heard him tell before, \u2014 some Jack had, in the first instance, told Tylor. Noav, Avhen Jack told a"], [88, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 76 story, he Avas possessed in the middle Avith a misgiving as to Avhether his audience had not heard the tale before or were not uoav being Avearied by the recital.

But the noble mind of Tylor was not troubled Avith such trifling considera tions. He never thought he Avas wearying any one. For he had a beautiful belief in himself, than Avhich is no more enviable and happy thing in all the Avorld. So he told Jack antique stories ; and Jack and his Song listened. The Boy had made no formal salutation to the Harriots, since his visit there. Which was a little rude of him. What his reason was, he himself hardly kneAv. Perhaps he Avas afraid Tylor Avould go Avith him ; and perhaps he did not Avish this ; and \u2014 perhaps there Avere other reasons.

The hillside had receded slightly, leav ing a little grassy glade betAveen itself and the stream. Jack Avas standing in the little glade : and a tall lady in grey stood Avith him. \" Ah, my Boy ! So the r?oiim-stream fishing Avas the best, was it ? I thought so.\" (He had not thought so, but he honestly believed he had.) \" Well, the sooner I decamp the better.\" But it Avas too late to do this. He might have \" decamped,\" or remained, so far as Jack was concerned.

But, inas much as he had been always curious to knoAv the Harriots, this objection, which Avas, moreover, not quite real, was easily over ruled. Jack found that he kne\\v the house by heart. The lawn ; the verandah, Avith the breakfast-room opening on to it; and, above this, the Avindow of his own room, where he had sat and Avaited for the daAvn on that \u2014 he Avas going to say, that dreadful night : but, after all, it had not been so bad ; and, round at the side (Jack kneAv perfectly Avhere it Avas and hoAv it looked, though he could not see it now), the little smoking-room, Avhere he had passed that still more dr \u2014 that peaceful and slum brous afternoon : \u2014 he remembered them all, as r; 2"], [96, "84 THE SHADOW OF A SONG if he had daily studied a photograph of the same.

By and bye, the door opened, and Hrs. Sleights put her head in : \" Hr. Sleights say he Avon't come in 'ere,\" she observed. \" If you Avould come into the kitchen and see 'im .\" And the head AvithdreAv. Jack closed one eye slowly at his com panion. But Tylor looked very serious. (This was owing to the gravity of the occasion, and not to a fear of accidents.) \" Come along, Boy : let's both of us go.\" They found Hr. Sleights reclined on a bench by the fire-side, smoking. His back"], [123, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 111 leant against the Avail; and his feet rested upon the kitchen- table. He did not alter this posi tion, Avhen they entered. Hrs. Sleights Avas Avashing some plates at a side-dresser. \"You Avanted to speak to us, Hr. Sleights?\" said Tylor. He and Jack remained standing : for a chair Avas not offered to them. \" Yes,\" said Hr. Sleights, removing the pipe from his mouth deliberately. \" I was workin' in the garding this arternoon, \u2014 I often does a bit of Avork in the garding betAveenAvhiles.

Apparently some remark"], [124, "112 THE SHADOW OF A SONG was expected. So, as Tylor seemed to be troubled Avith an affection of the throat, Jack intervened. \" Did you really make that rack yourself, Hr. Sleights ?

So I calls to my Avoman an' says, \"Ere's tAvo gents what want to Avrite a letter. Will you show 'em the parlour,' says I, 'and wher' the gen'lemen keeps their paper an' the rest.

I didn't knoAv anyone Avas coming to see me. But I daresay some friend heard I Avas here, and thought he Avould look me up. I expect he'll come again. I'm much obliged to you, Hr. Sleights.\" \" There's no obligation, \"gen'lemen,\" said Hr. Sleights graciously. And he settled himself against the Avail, and resumed his pipe, shoAving thereby that the conference Avas ended. \"Sounds rather like our friends of this afternoon,\" observed Tylor, as they returned to their room. \" It couldn't very avcII be them. One of Sleights's people kneAv me : but I didn't knoAv either of those felloAvs from Adam. And they certainly didn't sIioav any sign of recognition on their side.\" \"Yes, that's very true,\" said Tylor. But this great truth in no Avise prevented Tylor, and, in a lesser degree, Jack also, from harping on the idea that the tAvo pairs of men Avere one and the same pair. Having smoked several pipes upon the matter, they decided I 2"], [128, "116 THE SHADOW OF A SONG that the vieAv was at any rate possible, or, rather, probable, \u2014 nay, even certain, \u2014 absolutely certain. \" That story of their being your friends, Boy, was obviously a make-up. It's my belief they Avere burglars, Avho'd got hold of our names somehoAV ; and they simply made up that business about Avanting to Avrite, in order to get into the house. And I believe, if Hrs. Sleights hadn't kept a sharp look-out, they'd have slipped, up to our rooms, and just looted anything they could get. I shouldn't wonder if old Sleights hadn't thought the same thing; only he didn't say so.\" There Avas much to recommend this ex planation of the case. The main objection to it Avas, that the case was not explained by it. For, if the men had Avished to burgle Tylor and Jack particularly, why should they (assuming it was the same pair of men) have folloAved them to the Harriots' ? And, if they had wanted to burgle people generally, why should they, when they might have gone straight to the Harriots', have begun operations on tAvo poor fishermen like Jack and Tylor ? Jack put this vieAv, Avith some care, to Tylor;"], [129, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 117 thereby impaling that simple-minded man upon the horns of a dilemma. Moreover, this explanation, touching merely the identity of the tAvo pairs of men, did in no Avay, even had it been carried to some issue, affect ' the previous question ' of the respective personalities of the men. And the House adjourned at length in emphatic de spair : ' Business done : absolutely nothing.' But Jack Avas just closing his eyes to enjoy the luxury of thought (on a subject in no Avay allied to that before the House) when there was a sharp rap at the door, and, Avith out waiting for an ansAver, a dark figure clothed in pyjamas entered, and, feeling its Avay to Jack's bed, seated itself upon the edge. \" I say, Boy : you're not asleep, are you ? \" \" Not quite,\" said Jack, someAvhat sulkily ; as his little vision, frightened by this rude in terruption, fled away into the night. Now Tylor believed in pyjamas, and preached the gospel of them (at least, in those days : a little earlier, he had been the apostle of all things ' cellular ' ; Avhich creed was itself an apostasy from a previous stage of ultra-Iaegerism and flannel-Avorship) : Jack"], [130, "118 THE SHADOW OF A SONG called it his ' Pyjama Mission in Central Eng land.' When you saw him in them, he Avould commend their virtues, and then tell you some ancient tale about a man, Avho, being asked at dessert if he liked bananas, replied that he thought, d'you knoAv, he preferred the old fashioned night-shirt. Jack had not, since he had been at the Cottage, heard either the homily or the story Avhich went Avith it ; and, the time for their recurrence being noAV overdue, and the occa sion being eminently adapted for the same, he settled himself drearily in his bed to listen. But Tylor Avas not thinking just then of pyjamas, or of anything else ending in -ama or -ana, or of any other discourse or anecdote Avhatsoever. \" I say, Boy,\" resumed the figure mysteri ously; \"I've just thought Avho the dark man was. What old Sleights said about his eyes put me on the track. It Avas stupid of me not thinking of it before.\" A light dawned on Jack. \"You mean the felloAv A\\re met the other day by the Avater ? \" \" Yes, that's the man, of course. I can't"], [131, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 119 think Iioav I didn't think of it before. That's the man, of course.\" Jack shifted over to the further side of the bed, only half stifling a yawn, as he remarked : \"But the felloAv Ave met by the stream had a huge beard. The man Ave saAv this afternoon hadn't, had he ? And Sleights described the felloAv he saAv as clean-shaven, too.\" \" That's true,\" said the figure, thought fully. Then it added, rising : \" I don't care ; I believe its the man, \u2014 beard, or no beard. There Avas no mistaking the eyes. I re member them Avell noAV, as the man passed us. It tvas stupid of me not thinking of it before.\" And the dark figure, Avithout further com ment, or any anecdote at all, betook itself from the room. For a while, Jack lay thinking about the light-haired man, Avho was his special problem. But he ransacked his memory in vain. He could localise no idea of him, \u2014 any more than if he had tried to fix the fleeting recollection of some dream. Then, by and bye, his little vision came back"], [132, "120 THE SHADOW OF A SONG to him ; and, with the music of many waters about him, and another music Avhich rose out of it but Avas fairer than it or than any music in art or nature, \u2014 Avith a pleased and soothing sense of self-surrender to the Avhole vision, he fell asleep."], [133, "CHAPTER IX. 0 Romeo, Borneo ! wherefore art thou Borneo 1 Shakspeaee. \u2014 \" I'm sure Mr. Helston Avouldn't mind the other Avay, Avould you, Helston ? \" Elsie said nothing: only, Avhen their guests Avere gone, looked for one moment at her brother; then, Avithout saying a Avord, Avent up to her OAvn room, and locked the door.

Yet, if there be any Avho do not care for this manner of entertainment and are, moreover, troubled by no calls of conscience, let such as these omit the five next succeeding para graphs.

In life (the beginning is Avorthy of note), \u2014 in life men are made up of a complexity of passions and forces, Avhich hustle together and break one another, so that no single one of them ever fully works itself out.

The jealous man is not entirely jealous : his jealousy noAV and again clashes with his reason. For, in life, nothing is quite \u2014 , quite \u2014 : is Quite."], [182, "170 THE SHADOW OF A SONG. Then comes the tragedian, the poet ; and, taking one of these passions and forces, iso lates the same, and incorporates it in a human body, and gives it a sphere of action Avherein to develop itself: and, behold, an absolutely revengeful Hamlet, and an absolutely love-lorn Romeo, and an absolutely jealous Othello ; Avhose passion, being absolute and, thereby, too big to be contained within a human heart, groAvs into an external fate, and dominates the man from Avithout, and draAvs him sloAvly and surely and hopelessly to the falls of destruction. And this is the highest art : which, though dealing Avith life, is, in a Avay, untrue to life; and Avhereof the essence is the absolute. For, as the mathematician, though he must inscribe on the page a particular triangle, deals with it only as possessing cer tain absolute qualities : so the artist, though he must pourtray a particular person, strips off the accidents and treats him only as the vehicle of a certain absolute idea. But, so acting, the mathematician deals not only Avith that triangle but Avith all similar triangles, and the artist treats not only of that person but of all similar persons, \u2014 of the"], [183, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 171 type, the laAv.

Whether the historian also can do this or not, I do not Ioioav. Perhaps he can. Or perhaps the mere difference of prose and verse is a great difference ; and, Avhile the poet soars aloft with his ' strong-Avinged music ' to the upper heaven and revels in the sunlight of jmre ideas, the historian can only flutter along the ground and must move mostly among details : perhaps his art does not admit of such absolute abstractions and generalisations ; and he can never quite get rid of the acci dents, and isolate his phenomenon ; and only some of the remarks he makes about his tri angle will apply to other triangles. But, at any rate, he can \u2014 must, being an artist, \u2014 select ; turn the lime-light on some one idea ; and, if he cannot annihilate the rest, at least leave them in comparative darkness.

Time's up ! \" reiterated the Avarder, jangling his keys in anger.

Tylor had been gone about an hour, Avhen"], [202, "190 THE SHADOW OF A SONV the door of Jack's ceU opened again, and the Avarder reappeared, who informed Jack, Avith some asperity, that the Governor Avished to see him. This Avas the second thing Avhich had occurred Avithout a preliminary bell. The Governor Avas seated at the table in his office. Little piles of paper lay around him, sorted and ticketed : for he Avas a careful man. He looked up as they entered, and signed the warder to retire. \"You're a musician, aren't you, Hr. Helston?\" said the Governor. Jack looked at him in surprise. \" I'm fond of music,\" said Jack. \" But I'm not a musician.\" \" This Avas left here for you this afternoon, Mr. Helston,\" said the Governor. He pushed a sheet of paper across the table to Jack, and sat back in his chair, Avatching him. Jack's heart sank several inches Avithin him. He had hoped that Tylor had brought him a certain long longed-for message of condolence ; and all he saAv before him Avas a sheet of music-paper, filled with a succession of single notes. He looked at it in a kind of dull despair."], [203, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 191 \" Can you tell me the meaning of that ? said the Governor. Jack hardly heard the question. He stood looking blankly at the paper, and gulping doAvn his disappointment. Suddenly an idea struck him, and he examined the paper more closely. His knoAv ledge of music Avas not extensive, but he kneAv enough to be able to read single notes, and make out a simple tune in them, \u2014 more especially, if he had heard the tune before. After a couple of minutes, he looked up, and said sloAvly : \" I think it's the score of a song I'm rather fond of.\" The Governor appeared satisfied. For he dreAv the paper back to him, and Avrote his signature on the bottom, remarking : \" Well, I see no objection to your having it, Mr. Helston ; though Ave are not accus tomed to this kind of missive here. \u2014 You understand, of course, there must be absolute silence in a prisoner's cell.\" He touched a bell ; and the warder, re entering, conducted Jack to his cell again. As soon as Jack Avas alone, he sat doAvn"], [204, "192 THE SHADOW OF A SONG upon his stool, and, putting his head betAveen his hands, began to think. He did not know Avhether to be more pleased at getting any message at all or more disappointed at the form it took. It certainly Avas a little disappointing. But, after all, perhaps it Avas better this Avay. An ordinary letter Avould have been read by others. Jack greAV hot at the bare thought of it: for there are some letters you Avould sooner Avere not read by anyone. And, if the message must not be an ordinary letter, Avhat better message could there be than this song, Avhich Avas the token of everything that could be called anything ? It told almost as much as a letter, and shoAved, at any rate, that he Avas not throAvn aAvay in disgrace and quite forgotten. He unfolded the paper and revelled in the sight of it. Note by note, he spelt out the song, shaping the melody in his mind : he found a dreamy, drowsy, kind of pleasure in the mere dAvelling on it. Note by note, he spelt out the song ; and the song, as it greAv, con jured up a vision. The bare yelloAv Avails of the cell melted aAvay ; and, in their place, rose"], [205, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 193 the Avooded sides of a valley, Avith a stream running betAveen them, and, by the stream, a little rocky seat under an overshadoAving oak. And Jack was sitting on the rocky seat, listening to the murmur of the stream and the Avhisper of the leaves. And he Avas not alone. Hoav long he sat like this, he did not knoAv. A noise of footsteps outside : and the Avoods and the stream vanished; and he Avas sitting alone upon the Avooden stool between the four yefloAv Avails. He sprang up with a start and hastily thrust the paper aAvay, be fore anyone should see it: for that paper Avas sacred. As he did so, his eye caught sight of something at the end of it Avhich he had not noticed. He Avaited till the steps had passed, and took the paper out again. The notes descended the page duly and regularly, stave by stave ; until the last stave. Across this, about tAvo thirds of the way along it, a couple of bars Avere thickly draAvn in ink. That Avas natural enough, as marking the end of the song. But then they were foUowed by three solitary notes ; a N"], [206, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 194 little gap ; and another solitary note at the end. But did the bars mark the end of the song \\ And Avhat Avas the meaning of those solitary notes Avhich folloAved ? Jack Avas not learned in matters of music, as has been observed before ; and the sender of the song Avould know that; and Jack had supposed it Avas for this reason only that just the bare melody, Avithout any confusions of accompaniment, had been picked out in single notes, as being easier for the uninitiated to understand. Could there be any other reason for the adoption of this system of single notes? And Avas it possible that the song was some thing else beside a mere message of sym pathy ? Jack Avent to the spy-hole at the door, to make sure that no one Avas observing him ; then spread the sheet upon the little slab in the corner of his cell, and began to puzzle it out. Note by note, he Avorked out the song again. Before, he had only gone doAvn the first feAV staves : for he kneAv the thing by heart. He iioav spelt it out religiously, till he came to the tAvo black bars."], [207, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 195 These did not mark the ending of the song, but pulled the song up short, just Avhen the melody Avas at its height. And they Avere drawn so sharply and blackly, it looked as if there Avas some point in them. What, in the name of Avonder, could they mean ? And what, in the same name, Avas the meaning ot those single notes ? Jack paced up and doAvn his cell ; stop ping, from time to time, to look at the paper upon the ledge. The single note at the end enlightened him. He had been trying to find the sound for it. But it Avas evident that it Avas inten tionally placed alone; and, alone, it Avould be pointless as a sound. He tried Avhat letter it Avould represent. He had foreseen what it Avould be, before he Avorked it out. The note stood between the fourth and fifth lines : it was the letter ' E/ and stood evidently for the signature of the Avriter. The message ran then : \u2014 \" The melody of the Binding Song \u2014 stopped short. \u2014 three soli tary notes \u2014 Elsie \" : \u2014 Avhatever, if anything, that might mean. Jack looked at the other three unexplained N 2"], [208, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 196 notes under this new light. The first of them stood in the space next beloAv the solitary note he had just interpreted. It was there fore a ' C The second Avas in the space beloAv that again : \u2014 an ' A.' The third Avas on the line betAveen the first and second notes : \u2014 a ' B.'\u2014 ' C. A. B.' So the message ran : \" Binding Song \u2014 stopped suddenly \u2014 cab\u2014 Elsie.\" There Avas something a little ludicrous about the Avord ' cab,' especially occurring just there and in that context. And Jack laughed to himself as he folded up the paper and put it in his breast. But what it all meant, Jack could not, for the life of him, conceive. There was only one thing of which he felt certain ; and that Avas the signature at the end. Whatever else was obscure, this much was clear \u2014 if, indeed, there had been any doubt before, \u2014 that the missive came from his sweet singer, and shoAved that he Avas not forgotten. And the thought made even the pale wads appear less sanitary ; and gave colour even to the blank prospect of doing given things at given times in given places"], [209, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 197 after a given manner to the sound of given bells, and spending the long hours of day and night in the solitude of that healthy cell."], [210, "CHAPTER XIV. Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music : do I wake or sleep ? Keats. The given place Avhere the 'Exercise' occurred at a given time was by a corner of the budd ings, not far from the double -gated lodge. Here tAvo concentric rings, tAvo yards apart, had been accurately draAvn in asphalt among the stones and stubble of the waste. The prisoners walked round and round on the outer ring, like horses in training. They Avalked in single file, separated by regular intervals, Avhich differed in size according to the number of the prisoners : so that the chain should ahvays be complete. And the warders stood at given points upon the 'inner circle,' Avith staves in their trouser-pockets (for they Avere not ordinary pockets), to Avatch the prisoners, and see they kept silence, and be haved aright. This was the ' Exercise ' : and"], [211, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 199 the Condemned enjoyed an hour of it at 11, and the Trials at 9.30 ; and a bell rang in both cases. The morning after Tylor's visit and the coming of the missive, Jack Avent on circuit Avith a less feeling of Aveariness than usual. For his song had kept him company through the night ; and, as he Avalked along the asphalt ring, it did not desert him. Rather, since he had come into the open air, the song seemed clearer than in the quiet of his cell. Sometimes, \u2014 so real it AA'as,\u2014 he could almost detect in it, as he Avent round, the voice of the singer herself. And, as he listened, a pleasant droAvsiness crept over his senses, and sloAvly dimmed his eyes ; till the circle of the Avails became a glimmering outline against the sky, and he could scarcely see the back of the man in front of him. By and bye, as he Avalked, the idea came on him, \u2014 came on him, he kneAv not hoAv (as it had once come on him by the stream), that the music he heard Avas no longer of his oavu imagination, but of someone singing, \u2014 someone in the Avorld. A thrill Avent through him."], [212, "200 THE SHADOW OF A SONG He stopped dead and listened ; Avhile a warder in sultry language bade him proceed. Surely someone was singing, \u2014 a voice in the outer world. And surely the voice could not be mistaken. The song did not cease, as he resumed his place in the line. But the warder's impreca tions had brought him a little to his right mind ; and he examined every portion of the view, as it came into his ken in the Avalking round. The Prison-buildings Avere on one side ; the high Avail and the lodge covered the rest of the circle. He decided it must, after all, be his OAvn imagination. It had always been so Avith the Binding Song from the very first : he had never been certain Avhether the music Avas a fact or a fancy. Just noAV it might Avell be the last. For he had had special facilities for indulging his song of late : in deed, he had lived Avith it, and upon it ; and, only yesterday, it had been brought freshly to him in the missive. But, as he paced his trivial round, the song still continued. It had been soft before : it greAV no louder noAV ; and neither men nor Avarders appeared to notice anything. But it"], [213, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 201 got clearer, as if his ear Avere getting used to it ; until it seemed to come from every side and possess all the air. The droAvsy, dreamy, feeling crept over his senses once more. It Avas just as it had been on that afternoon at the Harriots', \u2014 the afternoon before he Avent away. Presently, the singing seemed to cease ; and the strain Avas taken up by some instrument. He listened, through his dream, Avith all the power he had. Surely there could be no doubt about the instrument : it Avas the zither. He could hardly think, hoAvever dulled his senses, that it Avas fancy any more. Fancy Avould not have wrought that change from voice to instrument. Still, the zither, of course, was associated for him Avith the song : and his fancy Avas strong enough to Avork in an entire orchestra of instruments. Vaguely, he thought of a test Avhich should decide the point. If the sounds Avere real sounds, and not merely his OAvn thoughts externalised, they Avould cease Avith the cessation of the Exer cise, Avhen he left the ground. Round and round he paced, immersed in his song and in his dream. It Avas pleasant"], [214, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 202 feeling that melody about him. But he Avas Avaiting, in his dream, for the end of the hour ; and, in his dream, it seemed as if the end Avould never come. It came at last. As the Prison-clock chimed the half, the music stopped : stopped short in the middle ; stopped as abruptly as if it had never been. And the dream fled with it. There could be no doubt about the matter iioav ; and Jack hugged the thought Avith delight, as he went back to his cell. Elsie had somehoAv found out the hour of the Exercise (for there Avas no means of seeing over the high Avails) ; and timed her song accordingly. This Avas better even than the missive. Ah yes, \u2014 the missive. Could the music sung have anything to do with the music Avritten ? Jack took the paper out again, and examined it. He could make nothing more of it than before. Rather, less. Both, indeed, ended abruptly : from Avhich it might seem that the one had been meant to prepare him for the other. But little Avas explained hereby : Avhile this much of correspondence only left the three solitary notes yet more inexplicable."], [215, "203 THE SHADOW OF A SONG He resigned the problem ; and Avaited, amid neAv visions of delight, for the next hour of exercise : Avhen he hoped that he might hear the song again. He Avas not disappointed. The song Avas again there to greet him, just as before ; only, this time, he recognised that it Avas external. It held him in its droAvsy folds, as he moved upon the circle ; ceasing, as before, abruptly, Avhen the clock made the half. Day by day, it Avas Avaiting there, ever beginning and ending as Jack entered and left the ground. And Jack dreamed and Avas comforted. And the missive Avas still unexplained. Until one day. It Avas a gloomy morning, and the sky Avas overcast Avith clouds. Jack Avas describing his circles, and revelling in his song ; and the other Trials Avere describing theirs, and not revelling in anything ; and the warders Avere standing at the given points, Avith their staves in their pockets, looking on and doing nothing : Avhen a ring Avas heard at the lodge-bell, and, after some disturbance, a huge dray, draAvn by three horses, appeared coming through the inner gates. There was nothing extraordinary in the"], [216, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG. 204 event. Carts entered the grounds at all hours, Avith provisions for the Prison, and wood or other material for the work of building done by the Condemned. Only, just noAV, the song greAv louder, \u2014 or Jack thought it did; and the change a httle roused him from himself to a half-consciousness of what was going on. The disturbance at the lodge increased. The dray had stopped, or somehoAv become impeded, just as the leader Avas only half clear of the inner gates ; and the porter Avas abusing the driver, and the driver, a white-haired old man, Avith a long Avhite beard, Avas abusing the porter. Prisoner and Avarder alike Avere interested in this small diversion : but the one had to con tinue circling, and the other standing still, none the less. As Jack came round to that point of the circle Avhich commanded a better vieAv of the lodge, he saAv, or, rather (for his senses Avere ahvays curiously clouded, Avhile he heard that song), he seemed, out of his dream, Avith out seeing, to be aAvare, that, though the inner gates Avere open, the outer doors, contrary to custom, Avere stiU unclosed. For the dray Avas piled Avith long planks of wood ; and, Avhat Avith these, \u2014 they protruded some way"], [217, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 205 out behind, \u2014 and the room taken up by the team, the gates and the doors had to be open at once. Suddenly, the music, Avhich had been grow ing louder and louder, stopped dead. Whether some idea as to the meaning of the missive flashed on him in that one moment, or Avhether he merely acted on some Avild im pulse, begotten of his dream, Jack, Avithout thinking what he was doing, and drawn, as it were, by some strong influence, left the ring and ran toAvard the lodge. The gates were only fifty yards distant ; and he Avas half-Avay to them, before the Avarders realised Avhat Avas happening. They gaped Avidely while a man might draAv three breaths. Then Avas there commotion in the Prison yard. The prisoners, in excitement, forgot their going round. Tavo Avarders ran after the fugi tive ; while the rest raised a hue and cry to stop him at the lodge. But the porter was still engaged in representing matters to the white-bearded driver; and, before the cry had reached his understanding, Jack had flashed past him, along the other side of the dray and out into the road."], [218, "206 THE SHADOW OF A SONG A four-Avheeled cab, Avith two horses, Avas standing opposite; and someone inside opened the door. Jack sprang in ; the door closed behind him ; and the cab drove quickly aAvay. As he passed, the Avhite-bearded man, in his anxiety to get out of the Avay, backed his dray cross-Avise athAvart the doors, catching the two Avarders in a trap, as it Avere, betAveen the dray and the Avail. They scrambled over the planks, and ran doAvn the lane to the high road. But the cab Avas iioav nearly out of sight. It had not made for the open country, but had turned to the right and was flying aAvay along the straight road toAvards the toAvn. An empty hansom was coming leisurely along. The men hailed it ; and started in pursuit. The chances in the race Avere not unequal. The four-Avheeler had a start and Avas drawn by tAvo horses : but it Avas heavy, \u2014 not the vehicle, thought the pursuers, Avhich they Avould have selected for the attempt ; Avhile the hansom ran lightly, and its horse Avas fresh. DoAvn the road they fleAV. Wayfarers paused"], [219, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 207 and jeered. Women came to the shop-doors and jeered. (For the populace are, by instinct, on the side opposed to laAv and order.) The houses ; the Bank ; the station : rattled by them. Right through the tOAvn they fleAV ; and out again into the country beyond. The hedge roAvs tore by them ; and the trees Avhistled and rustled. Along, past the Avood they fleAV. (One of the men silently pointed to the spot Avhere 'prisoner' had been seen by his friend.) The Harriots' house flashed by them ; and the chase again hove in sight. It Avas still far ahead, but the interval Avas quickly lessening. Then the chase disappeared once more. Presently, they turned into a long stretch of road, Avhich ran straight aAvay for a con siderable distance, betAveen two banks, into another Avood, and then veered sharply round to the left. The four-Avheeler had reached the middle of this straight road, about a hundred yards ahead of them. \" We shall soon have 'im noAV. Fancy the hass tryin' to get aAvay like that ! \" remarked one of the men.

But the end, though it could not be far off, Avas not to come just yet. The head from the AvindoAv appeared to give some direction to the driver; and the four-Avheeler, increasing its pace, doubled the corner Avithout losing more ground, and again vanished from sight. This must have been the last dying struggle of the chase. When the hansom turned the corner and got sight of them once more, they Avere still going hard, but there Avas scarcely more than fifty yards betAveen them ; and that distance was getting rapidly less and less. \" Stop ! \" yelled one of the warders, rising and leaning forward over the door. \" Stop, yer devil ! \u2014 Ugh ! \" reiterated the man. Still no sign from the four-Avheeler. \" Look 'ere, I'm going to send a bullet by them. That'll make 'em stop. \u2014 I'm going to fire,\" he shouted, \" if yer don't stop.\" Still not the slightest sign of attention.

You knoAV the place I mean, dear ? \" The place appeared to have some association for her companion. For he smiled, and looked strangely happy. And Jack, as he watched him, seemed to hear once more, amid the murmur of Avaters, that same mysterious song. But, before he could feel certain of this, the lady spoke again. \" You do not ask me how you are to leave the carriage, Avith these men pursuing us,\" said she, looking at the youth, Avith some amuse ment. \" See, they are only a feAV hundred yards behind us.\" She pointed, across a field, to the road they had lately left. Jack also folloAved her gaze, and saw, just above the line of hedges, the driver of a hansom, Avhich Avas gliding after them in pursuit. He looked at the lady in alarm. But she seemed quite confident and self-contained. While the youth, it Avas clear, had too much reliance in the lady to feel fear at anything. \" How, Elsie ? \" The lady did not ansAver for a minute. Then"], [231, "219 THE SHADOW OF A SONG she said : \" Will you do everything that I tell you, dear ? \" Yes,\" said the youth. Everything ? \" Everything,\" said the youth. Once more Jack lost the conversation ; and, Avhen next he looked, the youth Avas again gazing up at the lady Avith that strange gaze, as if, so it struck Jack suddenly, all his Avill and being Avere in some Avay merged in hers. \u2014 So it noAV seemed to Jack ; and he fed athinking of some song he had heard long years before. \u2014 But the lady Avas carefully taking note of the landscape, as they passed. Presently, she put her head from the Avin doAv, and looked' back. \" The man Avith the hansom is coming on too fast,\" Jack heard her say, as she sat doAvn again. \" I Avas afraid that he Avould.\" A feAV moments later, she looked out once more. \" Faster,\" said she to the driver ; \" a little faster.\" The lady resumed her seat, and her manner seemed to undergo a change. \" Noav, dear,\" she said quickly : \" you"], [232, "220 THE SHADOW OF A SONG remember the promise which you gave me ? \u2014 Everything I ted you. \u2014 In a minute Ave shall come to a turning of the road.

Jack looked at him in Avonder. \"The very instant I shall give the word.\" The lady sat perfectly stid, watching the bank Avith keen attention. The youth kept his hand upon the door, and watched the lady."], [233, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 221 Presently, they entered a Avood; and, two minutes aftenvards, they turned a corner. \" Noav ! \" said the lady. Jack looked in anxiety at the youth. He had throAvn the door open ; and stood ready, leaning out of the carriage. He seemed in no way afraid. \" Noav ! \" said the lady. The youth gave one lingering little look at the lady : then he sprang straight over the bank ; and the carriage rolled on Avithout him. Dimly, Jack thought he saAv the lady cast backAvard a troubled glance. Then for a mo ment, \u2014 so much did the leap amaze him, \u2014 a cloud fed upon his senses. He Avould fain have stayed near the lady (for he, too, was possessed of a longing desire to look into those strange eyes) ; but, by and bye, Avhen his Avonder left him, the carriage Avas gone far on, and the hansom after it, and he Avas left alone in the wood, beside the road. No : not alone. For the youth Avas also there. A long, deep bed of fern and moss had been heaped just Avithin the bank : and the youth lay by it ; quite still, and holding his hand upon his side. He Avas very Avhite, \u2014 so"], [234, "222 THE SHADOW OF A SONG white, that Jack thought for a moment that he Avas dying. The ferns and mosses near him Avere all tumbled and scattered. It Avas clear that they had been placed there to receive Irs fall ; but that, oAving to his hesitation, he had jumped too late, and, lighting upon the end of the heap, had been tossed Avith violence on to the hard ground beyond. Presently, he rose, and dragged himself sloAvly to the bank. Jack could see his fea tures drawn with pain, as he did so. The youth peered cautiously over the bank : then crept aAvay into the Avood, pressing his hand upon his side. Jack Avatched him Avith pity, till he vanished among the trees. Alas, why had he taken that last lingering look ? And yet they are very lovely, the faces Ave see in dreams. It is pleasant to Avander, on a fresh morn ing, among Avoods and fields, and drink the cool breezes of the moors ; and it Avas especially pleasant to Jack to be transported among them, in the twinkling of an eye, as it Avere, \u2014 five minutes only after he had been pacing the"], [235, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 223 dreadful round of prison-exercise. Jack bared his forehead to the air, and stood still a moment to realise his pleasure to the utmost, before making his Avay back to the cottage: (for he Avas returning there). Yes, it Avas a delicious thing to be free once more ; \u2014 a de licious thing, \u2014 though he Avas troubled Avith a curious pain in his side and felt strangely tired. It took, hoAvever, a long time, that journey to the cottage. He found some difficulty in Avalking ; and had, moreover, to take a devious route, clambering over hedges and Avading through bogs and streams, and, at times, even lying behind the bushes, when anyone came into sight : (for he had escaped from prison, and must avoid observation). It Avas nearly dusk as he approached the cottage. All the doors and windows were shut, as if the place Avere deserted. Not a sign of life could he see anywhere. Only a little bird, seated on the precise summit of one of the sentinel yew-trees, Avas tAvittering some solitary incessant sentence to the bare moors and a dun sky. Jack's heart sank Avithin him. For a"], [236, "224 THE SHADOW OF A SONG. moment, he fancied that the good folk of the house had gone away. But, although he had not analysed his reason for coming here, he Avas, some how, still assured that he had acted rightly in so doing. So he paused for a moment to reconnoitre ; then stole softly to the back of the cottage, and knocked at the kitchen-AvindoAv. The place was as silent as a sepulchre. Jack knocked again. Tins time, he thought that he heard something gently open : though he could not see where. Then stealthy steps stole doAvn the stairs. The back-door opened softly ; and he was aAvare of a Avell-remembered voice bid ding him come in. \" Poor gen'leman,\" said Mrs. Sleights, as she closed and bolted the door behind him. \" You'd ha' been having a hard time of it lately, Mester Helston.

He Avas utterly fatigued. When he Avoke again, it was quite dark. His side was paining him greatly. Mrs. Sleights had placed a lamp upon the table; and the food still lay there untouched. He Avas roused by a heavy tread of thick boots in the passage Avithout. The door opened, and an aged man Avith snoAv-Avhite hair and beard entered the room. It Avas an old man Avho had once driven a dray into the Prison yard. Jack sprang up from his seat. \" Well, Boy,\" said the aged man : \" so you thought I Avas a police-officer, did you ? \u2014 Why, Boy : hoAv pede you look ! \" Jack stared at him in blank amazement. i>"], [238, "226 THE SHADOW OF A SONG Then, all at once, the solution struck him.

But Jack could only Avaggle his hands feebly at him, and murmur, \" Nuncle, \u2014 Nuncle, \u2014Nuncle.\" And, by and bye, Tylor's feelings also over came him ; and, laying doAvn his fork, he laughed till he wept outright."], [239, "CHAPTER XVI.

He would be aAvay, by the bye, some time ; \u2014 several days, per haps; \u2014 or even, it might be, some months. All of Avhich Avas a little vague : not to say, someAvhat sudden.

Moreover, he was other wise employed in thinking Avhat one would say to another, if they met\u2014 say, by some stream (Jack's meeting, also, was to be near a stream) ; and what answer would be returned ; and other things, besides.

They carried her to her room, and, binding the wound in a Avay, laid her upon her bed : the little lady standing by, the Avhile, Avringing her hands, and moaning, \" What is the meaning of it all ? What is the meaning of it all ? \" But Elsie Avas not able to give explana tions just noAV. She lay back on her pdloAv, motionless, Avith closed eyes, and breathing heavily.

The nervous little lady had passed from hysterical nervous ness to nervous silence ; and stood Avatching her in speechless fear, going every minute to the Avindow to see if the expected help Avere at hand. But Elsie lay in a half torpor, \u2014 listening. And the afternoon Avore on to evening. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she strained forward eagerly. The little lady bent down over her. But Elsie Avas unconscious of any thing or anybody in the room. \" Jack ! \u2014 Jack ! \" she Avhispered. Someone came up the stairs ; entered the room; and feU upon his knees by the bedside, burying his face betAveen his hands. Elsie sank back Avith a little sigh of peace. \"Jack, my darling: I kneAv that you Avould come.\" She spoke as if she had expected him, \u2014 though he Avas not to have come till later, and not here, \u2014 but beside the little stream : and Tylor alone kneAv that the Boy had come"], [281, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 269 noAV, because he Avas too eager to wait for the appointed hour. She must have heard his footstep afar off: \u2014 the dying are quick to hear. \u2014 And the Boy, too, seemed as if he kneAv all. But this he might Avell have learned on entering the house. \" Jack, my darling : I kneAv that you would come.\" Then, feeling Avith her hand for his, she held it ; and they stayed, Elsie lying on the bed, and Jack kneeling by the bedside, both silent and unaAvare of the greater Avorld The little lady looked on in amazement for a moment : then, as if her worst fears as to the future movements of the criminal had not been realised, and Avith a tact Avhich she had seldom before displayed, stole on tiptoe out of the room. \" I kneAv you Avould come, dear.\" \" Yes, I am come, Elsie.\" She closed her eyes, and, for a little, lay as though she smiled. Presently, she roused herself : \" I Avanted \u2014 to teU you something, Jack.\" Her fingers played Avith his hair, as she spoke. \"I Avanted to tell you something, before \u2014 before .\""], [282, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 270 Jack stooped suddenly, and kissed the hand that he Avas holding. \" I have not ahvays been, \u2014 I have not al- Avays done \u2014 as I should have done, Jack .\" She paused for a minute ; and then con tinued, sloAvly: \"You remember the afternoon you \u2014 you lay sleeping ? \" Jack made no ansAver ; but boAved his head very Ioav, and kissed her hand again. \"It wasn't \u2014 a dream, dear. It wasn't a dream. \u2014 Do you think you can forgive me ? \" \" Elsie, \u2014 I can't live Avithout you.\" (Long ago, someAvhere, beside a stream, a youth had once spoken to a lady such Avords as these. \u2014 But that was only a dream.) \" I tried \u2014 to warn you, dear, \u2014 but Bertie \u2014 burnt the letter.\" This, too, had Jack heard one telling another in the distant past. But he made no answer : for none of those things mattered noAV. \" I didn't want you \u2014 ever to know, Jack.

' And Ave Avere to meet then, Jack, \u2014 my poor darling.\" As Jack looked up at her, a great light came into her eyes. \"And we were \u2014 to meet \u2014 then. She closed her eyes, from Aveariness ; and lay quite still, as one asleep. And, as she lay, an unspeakable sadness was in her face : for she had loved him. By and bye, the door opened, and the little lady came in. She took Jack quietly by the hand, and led him from the room. He Avent with her, Avithout resistance. An hour afterwards, \u2014 as the sun went doAvn, \u2014 the long night fell also upon Elsie's eyes."], [284, "CHAPTER XVIII. Stay for me there! I will not fail To meet thee in that hollow vale. Heney King. \" And avc Avere to meet then.\" Jack wandered out of the house into tho garden. You would hardly ha\\Te thought, to see him, that he Avas an escaped prisoner, committed for a serious crime, self-condemned by his oavii action, and noAV flying from the laAv and liable at any moment to be retaken. But Avhat did crimes and prisons and dangers matter noAV ? They might recapture and re immure him, if they Avould : it did not matter now. \u2014 So little did it matter, the chance scarcely occurred to him. He Avas only con scious of a dull, vague, sorrow, Avhich Aveighed his life to the ground : \u2014 conscious only of this, and of sad eyes that ever looked into his oavii and sad Avords that sounded ever in his ears, \u2014 \" We Avere to meet then.\" Gip came and thrust his nose against him,"], [285, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 273 as he left the hall. Gip looked unhappy : looked as if he Avere searching for someone, and Avanted some doubt settled and explained. The Boy stooped down and caressed him in an absent way. But there Avas someAvhere that he must go, and something that he must do ; and a voice Avas ever ringing in his ears : \" We Avere to meet then.\" And he turned, Avithout knoAv ing Avhither he Avent, toAvard the Avood. Little memories rose up and struck at him as he passed. A lady had once Avandered with a youth along this Avay. Here she had paused ; and here she had turned and looked at him; and here, as they walked, the sound of the Avaters had come more clearly to them. \u2014 It had been a pleasant dream : so pleasant, that the Boy had lived in it ever since. But iioav, \u2014 he only shivered a little, as he passed ; and Avandered on Avith listless feet, halting from time to time, as it Avere from pain. Over the little bridge he Avandered, and doAvn along the stream, until he came to the stone seat beneath the oak. It Avas here that youth and lady had sat long ago. But even this he hardly realised. Indeed, he scarcely kneAv that he had come : his feet had led him s"], [286, "THE SHADOW OF A SONG 274 here. And he only shuddered again (for his side Avas paining him) ; and, seating himself upon the rock, Avatched the Avaters as they tumbled along hi the last light of the setting sun. So this Avas the end of ad. A little dream of a feAV short Aveeks, \u2014 a feAV short days ; and into that brief spell of time a Avhole life pressed and forced.

Hoav had that music dominated his life ! He had heard it by the cool stream, to the accompaniment of rippling Avaters.

But, SAveet or terrible, it had governed him altogether; his whole life had moved to it ; ad his dreams had been instinct Avith it : \u2014 and so it would be, Avhen that dream came, from Avhich none awakeneth.
