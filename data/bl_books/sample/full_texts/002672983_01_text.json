Settlements in a wilderness country, small in origin and feeble in growth, rarely have occurrences of sufficient interest to bear narration, even if they should be retained in memory after the lapse of a few years. Records of local events, at early periods, are usually brief and unsatisfactory. Tradition, ever fruitful of information, is ordina rily so laden with fancy that it is frequently difficult to separate from it the sober truth of history. When the writer commenced collecting materials for this work, a wide and unexplored field of investigation opened before him, traversed by scarcely a discernible pathway. The footprints of an explorer had not, to any considerable extent, marked its surface. Judge Williams had prepared an interesting lecture on the history of the town, which he delivered before the Lyceum in 1830 ; and .fudge Weston had published in the \"Kennebec Journal,\" in 1851, four columns of personal \"Reminiscences of Early Times,\" and as orator, at the Centennial Celebration in 1854, had delivered an historic oration, which was published in pamphlet form by the city government. With these for a beginning investigation was commenced. The earliest records of settlements on the river were sought for and found in the transactions of the Plymouth Company,4 which were kindly furnished by the late Reuel Williams. These were diligently examined. As the settlements on the river, including our own, were the offspring of the efforts of this company, their transactions became identified with our history, and are fully noticed. Old newspapers, account books, let- ters, memoranda and records, various and numerous, were examined, and ancient settlers consulted ; but the day of reliable tradition had nearly passed. Traditions generally run in such narrow channels, and those relating to personal or local history are so liable to be colored by feeling or prejudice, that we have drawn lightly from this source, and have confined our investigations chiefly to records and other reliable means of information. The diary of Gen Sewall, furnished by his son Charles, and the diary of Mrs. Ephraim Ballard, furnished by her grandson, Thomas Lambard, read in the light derived from other contempo- raneous sources, furnished interesting and valuable material. The late Rev. John II. Ingraham manifested a kindly interest in the under-"], [12, "Preface. IV taking and furnished letters, memoranda and documents from the papers of the late Dr. Daniel Cony. The late John McKeen of Brunswick, the kind-hearted antiquarian, furnished valuable documents relating to the history of the river. From these and numerous other sources, most of which are mentioned in the text or foot-notes, the work has been com pleted by laboring at intervals of time not required for more pressing duties. In this connection the warm interest of the writer's friend, the late Richard H. Vose, should be mentioned. He examined portions of the manuscript, and by a too partial appreciation greatly encouraged the work. From the mass of material collected it was difficult to make a proper selection. To avoid tediousness in details was frequently impossible ; to enliven the narrative to a greater extent, was not in the province of the writer, if the subject and material had been suitable for the purpose ; to have rejected even apparently frivolous incidents, would be in forget fulness that local history is in part made up of them, and that they some times acquire interest when connected with time, person or place. The plan of the work embraces an occasional glance at general history, to illustrate, connect or give interest to local events. A chronological arrangement has been preferred, while with the aid of the index the subjects may be read continuously. The biographical sketches are necessarily brief and limited in number. The genealogical register, which is of considerable local interest, it is to be regretted could not have been extended and made more complete. But this was impossible without more labor and prying inquiry than could be devoted to it. Public records of families were appropriated as public property ; private records were used only by consent of some prominent member of the family to which they relate. In some cases dates were designedly withheld, while in others they were beyond recall. Care has been taken to secure accuracy and correctness in every part of the work. For the measure of exemption from typographical and other errors we are largely indebted to the friendly services of Joseph H. Williams, whose interest in the work prompted him to render valuable aid in carefully revising the printer's proofs. If the work shall be found useful in rescuing some of the interesting facts of our early history from oblivion, and placing others in a condition for easy reference, adding a rill to the current of general history, its object will be accomplished.

When Du Mont in sailing along the coast of Maine in 1604 found the Kennebec, he was persuaded, from the account he received from the natives, that he had learned of a nearer route to Canada than had been discovered the previous year by the way of the Bay of Chaleur, and he returned the same season and took possession of the country contiguous in the name of his sovereign,. the King of France.1 This was the first attempt of royalty to obtain foothold on the banks of the Kennebec. Three years after, in 1607, the first expedition to plant a colony at the mouth of the Kennebec, then called Sagadahoc, arrived, under the command of Capt. George Pophani, near the island of Monhegan, early in August, in two ships called the Gift, and Mary and Juhn. From Monhegan they proceeded to the mouth of the river, and in the language of Pophani \" chose the place of their plantation at the mouth of Sagadahoc, in a westerly peninsula, where they heard a sermon, read the patent and laws, and built a fort.''2 The peninsula here mentioned is Cape Small Point, where tradition locates the fort, and recent examination has traced the outline of its intrenchments on the shore of Atkins' Bay.3 The colony numbered forty-five persons. Their fortress was named Fort St. George. During the winter they built a small vessel named Virginia, from the name by which the country was then known, North Virginia. This was the first vessel known to have been built in the State. 1 Sullivan's Kist. 55. 8 Me. Hist. Soc. Col. vol. 2, p. 28. J Ib. 3, 300."], [22, "1614. Early Voyages.\u2014 Charter of 1620. 2 The unusual severity of the winter, the loss of their storehouse by fire, and the death of Chief Justice Popham, their patron in England, and other causes, so discouraged the colonists that the next year they abandoned the settlement and returned to England. The ships which carried them from the Kennebec were on the ocean at the same time with the little squadron of the French, who succeeded-in building Quebec the very summer in which this part of Maine was deserted.1 The glowing accounts of the early voyagers who had visited North Virginia had aroused a spirit of enterprise and adventure in England, which the return of Popham's colony, with the dis couraging accounts which they gave to justify their abandonment of the country, allayed and ended all hope of immediate coloniza tion. 1614. This state of things continued until the celebrated John Smith, renowned for his adventure in South Virginia, sailed from England with two vessels and forty-five men, with instructions adapted to a voyage of adventure, discovery and trade. He shaped his course for the vicinity of Sagadahoc, and arrived at Monhegan the last of April, where he built seven boats, in which 3ie sent his men on fishing excursions, while he in a small boat explored the coast, trading with the natives, aud gathering such iiifui mation relating to the country as he could obtain. Upon his return to England, where he arrived August 5th, he prepared a map of the country he had visited, and gave it the name of New .England. He also published an account of his voyage, giving a description .of the country. As to the result of his voyage he says, \" We got 11,000 beavers, 100 martins and as many otters,\" and took and cured \"40,000 dry fish,\" and \"7,000 cod fish\" corned and pickled.2 The success of this voyage, the net earnings of which amounted .to \u00a31500 sterling, a large sum for that day, and his favorable report of the country, infused new life into the spirit of colonial enterprise. 1620. As# early as 1620, a charter was granted by James the First, to forty \"noblemen, knights and gentlemen,\" creating them a body politic aud corporate by the name of \"The council estab lished at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, for planting, ruling and governing New England in America.\" 1 1 Bancroft's U. S. 2(38. ' 2 M. H. S. Col. 34, Will. H. 212."], [23, "1626. Kennebec Ascended. \u2014 Kennebec Patent. 3 To this council were given ample powers of government, exten sive territory and rights of exclusive trade. The territorial limits extended from the fortieth to the forty eighth parallel of latitude, and from \" sea to sea.\" In this wide belt of land crossing the continent flowed the river Kennebec, the mouth of which, under the name of Sagadahoc, had been visited by Europeans; but its interior waters were unexplored. 1625. The first trading adventure up the Kennebec of which we have an account was by the colonists of New Plymouth, in 1625. Becoming acquainted in their excursions along the coast with the advantage of trade with the natives, in the fall of that year they ascended the Kennebec in a shallop loaded with corn, under the command of Edward Winslow. In exchange fin- their corn they obtained \" 700 pounds of beaver, besides other furs.\" From this time the colonists of New Plymouth took measures to secure to themselves the trade of the river. In 1628, they estab lished a trading post near its mouth, probably at tiie site of Pop ham's fort. In January, of the next year, William Bradford and his associates obtained a grant from the Council of Plymouth, in the county of Devon, of the soil where they were settled, in Massachusetts, called New Plymouth. At the same time Bradford and others who were of the colony obtained a grant of land upon the Ken nebec river, which was considered a special concession to the trade of the colony. This grant embraced \"all that tract of land, or part of New England in America, which Heth within or between, and extendeth itself from, the utmost limits of Cobbiseconte, alias Comasseconte. which adjoineth to the river Kenebeck, alias Kenebekike, towards the western ocean, and a place called the Falls, at Neguamkike, in America aforesaid, and the space of fifteen English miles on each side of the said river commonly called the Kenebeck river, and all the river Kenebeck, that lies within said limits.\" This grant, so loosely defined in its northern and southern boundary, was held by Bradford and his associates until 1640, when they surrendered it to \" all the freemen of New Plymouth.\" As this grant became the foundation of land titles to a large terri tory on the Kennebec, its boundaries were of great importance, and were not settled until after tedious litigation in the next century. With the assistance of Indian deeds, legislative enact ment, judicial construction, and awards of referees, it was finally"], [24, "1625. Canibas Indians. \u2014 Cushnoc. 4 determined that it should extend from the north line of the town of Woolwich on the east side of the Kennebec, and the north line of Topsham on the west, to Wesserunsett river, which joins the Kennebec below Skowhegan. This large tract of land, known to be rich in furs and fisheries, was occupied by the numerous and powerful tribe of Canibas Indians, who claimed the land on both sides of the Kennebec from its source to Merrymeeting Bay. They embraced two or three political families under Kennebis who resided upon Swan Island. They were more friendly to the English during their first intercourse with them than other tribes, and did not decrease so rapidly. Their warriors were estimated at fifteen hundred bold and brave men. The lands of the Canibas Indians were the best part of Maine for the support of an Indian population. The waters of the river and its tributaries as well as its ponds were abund antly stocked with fish, and the forest with the choicest kinds of game. One of the principal points of gathering for this tribe was Cushnoc, the Indian name of what is now Augusta. Cushnoc was early known and often visited for the purpose of trade. New Plymouth, the year the Kennebec Patent was ob tained, in order to secure the trade upon the Kennebec to which they had an exclusive right, and to promote their interest in this quarter, established trading posts at Cushnoc, Richmond landing, near the head of Swan Island, and at Popham's Fort.1 The post at Richmond landing was discontinued, probably for the reason that the fur trade, which was most profitable to the colonists, could be better pursued at Cushnoc, as the supply of the richest furs came from the upper waters of the river. The establishment at Cushnoc was successfully continued for many years, until grow ing Indian troubles diminished the trade, and war finally ended it. The Council of \" Plymouth, in the county of Devon,\" previous to its dissolution in 1635 had granted patents embracing the coast of Maine, from Piseataqua to Penobscot, excepting what lies between Sagadahoc and Damariscotta. The most of this excepted part was claimed under the Kennebec Patent. The first patent granted by the Council of Plymouth of land in New England was to John Pierce of London, and his associates, dated June 1, 1621. This was a roving patent granting one hundred acres for each settler already transported, and such as should be transported ; the 1 Williamson's History, p. 237."], [25, "1630. Waldo, Pemaquid and Pejepscot Patents. 5 land to be selected by them under certain restrictions. Pierce located at Broad Bay, and afterwards found Brown at New Har bor, with an Indian deed of the territory, and they joined their titles and continued the settlement already begun at New Harbor and Pemaquid, which became prosperous and populous as the extensive remains at those points strongly indicate.1 The Muscongus, or as it was afterwards called, the Waldo Patent, was granted in 1630 to John Beauchamp of London, and Thomas Leverett of Boston, England. It extended northerly from the seaboard, between the Penobscot and Muscongus rivers, embracing a territory equal to thirty miles square.2 The Pemaquid Patent, dated February 20, 1631, was to two merchants of Bristol, England, Robert Aldsworth and Giles Elbridge. It extended from the sea, between the Muscongus and Damariscotta rivers, so far as to embrace 12,000 acres of land. This grant was made in consideration of public services rendered by the patentees, and their engagement to build a town.3 They probably eflectod an arrangement with Pierce and Brown, by which the settlements already begun were continued under the Pemaquid Patent. About the time of the above mentioned grants a grant was made to Thomas Purchase and George Way, including lands lying on both sides of Pejepscot, on the eastern end of Andro scoggin river, on Kennebec river and Casco bay. The date of this patent is not known, the original having been long since lost, and no record remains. It is known to have existed by reference to it in ancient deeds,4 and is known as the Pejepscot Patent. Titles to land in the territory between Sagadahoc and Dama riscotta are through the Kennebec Patent, Indian deeds and ancient settlements. Here and there a settler upon the seaboard bad taken possession to trade, hunt or fish, at an early period, previous to any grant from the Council of Plymouth. The earliest settlement which was continued is said to have been on the western bank of Pemaquid river, probably under Pierce, and prior to his grant in 1021. A deed of land in that quarter was obtained of two Sagamores by John Brown, at a later date, July 15, 1625. Abraham Shurte, as a magistrate at Pemaquid, took the acknowledgment the succeeding year. Shurte was agent for 1 See Willis, Portland, p. 22. 3 1 Will. H. 241. - 1 Will. H. 240, 1 M. H. S. C. 16. * 1 M. H. S.

The settlement at Pemaquid was. extended, and had a gradual uninterrupted growth till the first Indian war.1 Brown's residence was at New Harbor, near Pemaquid, as early as 1621. He and his descendants lived there till driven away by the Indians.2 Fishermen and settlers established themselves about this time at Sagadahoc, Merrymeeting, Cape Newagen and other places.9 Thomas Purchase and George Way established their residence at the head of Stevens' river, on the Pejepscot Patent, in 1624-5, where a few habitations which originated in their enterprise were found in 1636. The Province of Acadia was, in 1632, restored to France, without any definite boundary. She claimed to Pemaquid, and occupied to the Penobscot until the whole Province was taken possession of by the English, in 1654, and confirmed to them by treaty the next year. On the restoration of Charles II New England was divided into twelve Provinces, and Commissioners were sent over to regulate the affairs of the country. The Commissioners established the county of \" Cornwall \" east of the Kennebec, and appointed magistrates at Sheepscot, Pema quid and other places within the county. But the territory extending east of Pemaquid and the Kennebec to the St. Croix, and north of a line from the head waters of the Pemaquid to the Kennebec, was, in 1664, granted to the Duke of York, under the name of the county of New Castle, appertinent to his province of New York, and his government was extended over it for twenty-five years. The Duke caused a city, called Jamestown, to be built at Pema quid, also a fort called Fort Charles. During his government Pemaquid was the port of entry for the Kennebec river, and Capt. Nicholas Manning, commander of the Fort, was instructed, \"not to suffer any vessel whatever to go into or up Kennebeck River or any part thereof until they have first made their entry with you at Jamestown, and paid his Majestie's dues, and if any shall presume to do the contrary, you are to seize both vessel and goods, and pro ceed against them by law, as directed for defrauding his Majestie's customs.\" In 1684, a block house was established by the town of 1 Will.

This was under the command of John Rawdon and garrisoned by a \"file of soldiers.\" They were at the block house, authorized to \" trade and traffic, paying cus toms, according to the act of Assembly.\"1 At the close of the war with France, in 1667, Acadia was restored to the French, who then took possession as far as the Penobscot, but claimed to Sagadahoc. The people of Pemaquid being averse to the jurisdiction of France came under that of Massachusetts.2 In 1634 New Plymouth still continued their trade upon the Kennebec, at their posts at Atkins bay and Cushnoc, where they obtained this year twenty hogsheads of beaver.3 The colony had upon the river two magistrates who were empowered to try every case not capital, and all within the patent were required to take the oath of allegiance to the colony and obey its laws and the orders of the magistrates or be banished. In May of this year a vessel of Lords Say and Brooke from Piscataqua, commanded by one Haskins, arrived in the river, intending to trade with the Indians. This he was forbidden to do, but disregarding the command of the magistrates to depart, he ascended the river, whereupon John Allen, one of the magistrates, sent three men in a canoe to cut his cables. Having cut one, Haskins said, \" Touch the other and death is your portion,\" at the same time seizing a gun to execute his threat. The cable was cut and the gun discharged, killing one of the men instantly. Haskins, however, received at the same time a fatal wound. It is said this was at Cushnoc,4 which is highly probable, as Haskins, disregard ing the command of the Plymouth magistrates \" would needs go up the tMx above their House towards the falls of the river and intercept the trade which should come to them.\"5 Allen was after ward arrested in Massachusets and held to answer for the offence, which excited party seeling, the royalists exclaiming \"when men cut throats for beaver it is time to have a general government.\" The affair was submitted to an advisory tribunal, who decided that the colony, whose servant Allen was, had an exclusive right to the trade within their patent, that they had entered upon and occupied the territory undisturbed even by the natives ; that they 1 Pemaquid Papers, 5 M.

Their employment was chiefly hunting and trading with the Indians, the product of which was various kinds of furs, of which beaver was the most valuable and the principal article of commerce. It became a sort of circu lating medium, or standard of value, and remittances were made by it to the mother country. In 1640 the price of beaver at Casco was from six to eight shillings per pound, at which it was received in payment of labor and commodities.1 At an early period, about the time of the settlement of Quebec, Father Biart, a French Jesuit, paid a transient visit to the Canibas Indians upon the Kennebec, by whom he was well received. He made so favorable an impression on the minds of the natives that. they afterwards sent to the governor of Canada for a teacher of the faith. Perceiving the policy of erecting a barrier to English aggression by means of their influence with this tribe, Father Dreuillettes was sent to them, in 1646. He was the first regularly settled, evangelical laborer in the wilderness of the Kennebec, and remained some years, acquiring great influence with the tribe. Twice he jo-aiieyed to Boston to form an alliance to protect them and other tribes against the invasion of their enemies, the Iroquois.2 The trade upon the Kennebec which flourished for many years had, in 1649, declined. The natives had gradually become better acquainted with the value of their furs and the articles offered them m exchange ; and the increasing number and avaftcious dis position of the traders ; the decrease of game and furs ; the absence of local government ; the questions of territorial rights, which were raised by holders of contiguous patents ; and the uneasiness of the natives, who had already been under French influence, and were in communication through Jesuits resident among them with the government of Canada; all tended to produce a depression in trade so unfavorable to New Plymouth, that they leased, in 1652, the trade at Kennebec for \u00a350 per year. The next year, in order to further promote the interest of the patent, the General Court appointed Thomas Prince a commis- 1 Willis' History of Portland. 2 Lincoln Papers, 1 M. H. S. Col."], [29, "1654. Prince's Government. \u2014 Lease Renewed. 9 sioner to institute a civil government ; requiring him to summon the inhabitants to take the oath of allegiance to the governments of England and New Plymouth, or leave the patent. A meeting was notified by Prince, at the house of Thomas Ashley, at Merrymeeting Bay, on the 25th of May, 1654, where he was met by sixteen men, to whom he adminstered the oath of allegiance. One of them, Thomas Purchase, of Pejepscot, was chosen \" assistant to the government,\" and John Ashley constable. This little company of freemen established laws and regulations, by which crimes of higher grade only were to be tried at New Plymouth, by the General Court ; lesser crimes were under the jurisdiction of the commissioner and his assistant. TJieft was punished by restitution of three or four fold ; drunkenness was fined for the first offence 5 shillings, 10 shillings for the second, and the storks for the third. Every inhabitant selling Indians strong liquor was fined for the first offence double the value of the liquor sold, for the second quadruple. If the offender was a stranger, which probably meant a person not under allegiance to New Plymouth, or not having lights of trade on the patent, he was fined \u00a310 for the first offence, and \u00a320 for the second, intending probably to inflict punishment for a breach of the laws and infringing upon the exclusive right of trade by the same penalty.1 The commissioner's court was appointed to be held at the house of Thomas Ashley. The people of New Plymouth had high expectations of the profits which might arise to them from the exclusive rights which they possessed on the Kennebec of trading with the Indians, and from the fisheries. Being disappointed in this, they were jealous of Bradford and his associates, to whom the lease was made, and so strong was this feeling that, in 1655, when the lease expired, a special warrant was issued to every town in the colony, requiring them to \" send their minds \" to a General Court, to be holden on tin- 5th of March, of the same year, \" to treat and conclude about the letting of the trade in Kennebec.\" The lease was finally renewed for seven years, at \u00a335 per year, \" to be paid in money, moose, or beaver,\" at current rates. This was done without any town sending in its \"mind \" in opposition ; but it was provided, \"that in case any of them should dislike what 1 Williamson's History, 367."], [30, "1661. 10 Kennebec Patent Sold. was done as aforesaid, they should send in their dislike thereof, in fourteen days after this court.\"1 As the lessees could not revive the trade for the three years succeeding the renewal of their lease, and as they could not afford to pay the price agreed upon a fourth year, the troubles with the Indians having increased, the trade was leased for the small sum of \u00a310, and the next year was abandoned to any one who might volunteer to improve it. The colony at the same time proposed to sell the patent, for which purpose a committee of three were appointed, who effected a sale October 27th, 1661, to Antipas Boyes, Edward Tyng, Thomas Brattle and John Winslow for \u00a3400 sterling.^ This sale ended the title of New Plymouth to the land and trade of the Kennebec patent, after thirty-four years' improvement. The new proprietors, for many years, did nothing towards set tling or improving their lands, the disturbed state of public affairs, and the outbreaks with the natives which soon followed, precluding all hope of a successful effort to that end. 1 Williamson's History, 1, 370. 2 Ib."], [31, "CHAPTER II. FROM THE WAR OF 1666 TO THE CLOSE OF THE SPANISH WAR IN 1748. In 1666 war was declared by France to aid Holland against England, which, without any military movements on this side of the Atlantic, resulted in the next year in a treaty of peace, by which the Province of Acadia was again ceded to France. The Indian war which had continued for six or seven years between the New England tribes and the Mohawks, without much troubling the English colonist, was not brought to a close until 1609. This was succeeded by the Dutch war, in 1673 ; and finally King Phillip's war, which was the first war of the Indians against the whites, broke out in June 1675. The settlements on the Kennebec at the commencement of this war were at the mouth of the river, where there were trading posts and forts. Thomas Purchase in 1654 purchased an exten sive tract of land on the river Androscoggin of the Indians, and resided near the falls at Brunswick, on his Pejepscot patent, where he traded with the natives forty or fifty years, acquiring a large estate.1 Richard Hammond, au ancient trader, had erected a trading house and fortification on Arrowsic Island. He had also a trading house at Ticonic falls, where he was so imprudent as to rob the Indians of their furs. Clark and Lake had a large establishment on Arrowsic Island, about two miles below Hammond's, also a trading house on the west side of the Kennebec, opposite Nahum keag, at Alexander Brown's house, and another at Ticonic falls. Thomas Atkins was at Atkins' bay, and Ambrose Hunnewell at Hunnewell's point. There were on Arrowsic and Parker's Island thirty families, and on the west side of the river, below the chops of the Kennebec, twenty families2, and the settlements at the east, on the Sagadahoc territory, were in a flourishing condition. The Canibas and Anasagunticook Indians were visited, to ascer- 1 Sullivan, 346. \u2022 2 M. H.

They were thought to be favorably disposed, and measures were taken to secure their friendship, but the latter tribe having conceived an aversion to Thomas Purchase, in his absence robbed his house. Hammond's fort was next attacked, in August 1676. Hammond and two others were killed, and sixteen persons taken prisoners. The savages then proceeded to Clark and Lake's fort, and secreted themselves so that they could see the movements of the sentinel. As he retired from his post earlier than usual, they followed him through the fort gate, and instantly closing the port holes assumed to be masters of the garrison. The men of the fort, aroused from their sleep, fought desperately, hand to hand, with the savages, but were overpowered. Lake fled' through a back door, pursued by the enemy, and was killed. About a dozen escaped, but thirty were either killed or carried into captivity, and all the buildings burned.1 The Indians had previously murdered Alexander Brown at Clark and Lake's trading house, opposite Nahumkeag.2 East of the Kennebec the inhabitants fled, and Pemaquid, New Harbor, and Damariscove were burned. The war terminated by a treaty concluded at Casco, April 12th, 1678. The settlers had again established themselves on their lands, during the ten years of peace which ensued, when \"King William's War,\" in 1688, agaiu seDt the savages upon them. Nine persons were taken prisoners about Sagadahoc. The houses on the north margin of Merrymeeting bay were plundered and destroyed, and the inhabitants who resisted were barbarously murdered. Several of the captives taken were killed in a drunken frolic, and the rest sent to Ticonic. Captives were first sold in this war to the French in Canada. The inhabitants east of Falmouth withdrew to that place for protection, after which Kennebec had little connection with the war.3 Major Church however ascended the river several leagues on his eastern expedition, and after leaving sixty soldiers at Falmouth, returned to Boston. The destruction of Falmouth having been planned by the French, it was attacked on the 16tb of May, 1690, by 500 French and Indians. The inhabitants who could not reach the protection of the fortifications were slain, and their dwellings burned.

Forty miles up the river, at an Indian fort, he recovered some captives, killed twenty-one of the enemy, took one prisoner, and plundered the fort, which contained some valuable property, and left it in flames. In November, 1690, a truce for five months was signed at Sagadahoc by Commissioners from Massachusetts and six Saga mores, when ten English captives were released. But four settle ments remained at this time in Maine, Wells, York, Kittery, and the Isle of Shoals.2 At the expiration of the truce, May 1, 1691, the Indians again commenced their depredations, and early in February of the next year, being led by several Canadian Frenchmen, they assailed the remaining settlements. York was surprised, and scenes of the most horrid carnage ensued. Seventy-five persons were killed and as many more taken captive. The rest of the population escaped into four garrisoned houses, the only fortifications in the place. The unfortified houses were burned, when the Indians retired with their captives and plunder. In the succeeding June, the French and Indians, 500 strong, appeared before Wells. The inhabitants having intimation of their approach were distributed among the \"fortified houses,\" and Capt. Convers with fifteen/ men defended a fort, which mounted some cannon. After a scige of forty-eight hours, and a fierce assault, the enemy was repulsed by the brave garrison, without the loss of a man. Major Church in ascending the Kennebec this jrear on his third expedition, had a skirmish with the Indians, some of whom he drove to the woods, while others fled in their canoes to their fort at Ticonic. When they discovered the Major in pursuit they burned their huts and escaped. What was not already on fire was com mitted to the flames, among which were some cribs of corn.3 The next year, Capt. Convers ascended the Kennebec as far as Ticonic, with a force to chastise the Indians, but they were dispirited, and fled at his approach. 1 Williamson, 621. s Ib. 627. 3 Ib. 636."], [34, "1693. Treaty at Pemaquid. \u2014 Missionaries. 14 Having become tired of the war, and neglected by the French, the Indians, by thirteen Sagamores, on the 11th of August 1693, signed at Pemaquid a treaty of peace. But the Jesuits resident among them, under instructions from the government at Quebec, dissuaded them from complying with the terms of the treaty.1 Jaques Bigot had been, and still was, missionary at Kennebec. His father, Vincent Bigot, was at Penobscot, The French authorities credit the missionaries, particularly Jaques and Vin cent, with the good understanding they had preserved with the Indians, and the success they had met with against the English.2 At the time of the treaty. Father Sebastian Rasle, the famous Jesuit, after four years residence among the Canadian Indians, had just taken up his abode at Norridgewock, on the lands of the Canibas Indians, where he resided for twenty-six years. He is said to have been a man of learning and talents, who by his condescending manners, religious zeal, and untiring perseverance, greatly endeared himself to the tribes, many of whom he taught to read and write.3 The Indians generally, in 1694, were dispirited and inactive. They entered into a truce the succeeding year, which was followed by an unsuccessful parley at fort William Henry. This celebrated stronghold was built of stone in 1692, on the site of the old fort at Pemaquid, and had in 1696, become a noted public garrison, which the French determined to reduce, as it controlled the western part of what they claimed as Acadia. Two men of war, with two companies of soldiers, dispatched from Quebec, appeared before the fort, July 14. They were supported by 50 Mickmaks, and 200 Penobscot Indians, under Baron de Castine. Capt. Chubb who commanded the fort was summoned to surrender. He had fifteen guns well mounted, ninety-five men doubly armed, and abundance of ammunition and provisions, and was able to stand a long siege against a much larger force than was before him. He returned a spirited reply to the summons, when the French landed some mortars and threw a few bombs into the fort. Amid the consternation they occasioned, Castine sent Chubb a letter, threatening him with the vengeance of the savages, if he did not surrender. He then disgracefully capitulated, yielding up the fort, which was plundered and demolished.4 1 Will. 639. 3 2 Will. 101, M. H. S. Col. 1, 331 4 AVilliamson 1, 644. 2 M. H. S.

The French by treaty, and Massachusetts by charter, claimed the country between the Kenne bec and the St. Croix. The French having determined to maintain their claim as far west as Kennebec river, and from its source to its mouth, in order to secure the alliance of the Canibas tribes, in 1698, built a chapel upon their lands at Norridgewock, which was occupied by Father Raslu, the reshlent missionary, who kept up a correspondence with the civil government and his religious superiors in Canada. During the progress of the war, and as earlj' as 1690, the public expenses had exhausted the receipts from taxes levied the previous year. The public chest was empty. In this extremity the General Court ordered a tax to be laid upon the people of \u00a340,000, and in anticipation of its payment, issued \" Bills of Credit,\" as a substitute for money, in amounts from 2 shillings to \u00a310. These were the first put in circulation by any of the colonies, and were the origin of paper money. It soon depreciated one-third, but afterwards was equal to gold and silver, and so continued while small sums were issued.2 It was not until the close of the ten years war, in 1699, in which the savages had gained nothing, and the settlers had lost every thing, that the attention of government and the proprietors of laud was again turned to the settlement of the country. Fal mouth, Saco and Scarborough were revived. York, Kittery and Wells, having survived, were assisted ; and the resettlement of Pejepscot was undertaken.3 Peace however was of short duration. Queen Anne, May 4, 1702, declared war against France, which soon brought rumors of meditated Indian hostility. It was attempted to avert this by a conference with the Indian chiefs at Casco, in June of the next year. The conference raised hopes of success, which soon proved delusive.

The attacks were renewed from time to time, during- the war, which lasted ten years, when the treaty of Utrecht, March 20, 1713, concluded it between the natives, and in July of the same year a treaty was signed with the Indians. But few events of this war were upon the Kennebec. The Canibas Indians were actively engaged in it, and to chastise them, Col. Hilton was sent by government, in 1705, with 270 men including 20 friendly Indians to Norridgewock, in the winter, on snow shoes. The expedition took twenty days' provision with them. The season was considered favorable for the march, and the fatigues of a winter campaign were endured with fortitude and patriotism. But upon their arrival they found only a large chapel and vestry, and deserted wigwams, which they reduced to ashes.1 In 1709, the Kennebec Indians sent a delegation with a flag of truce to Boston to sue for peace, which was not concluded until June 11, 1713. Three of the eight Indians who signed the treaty were Canibas chiefs, one of whom, Bromaseen, was one of the most distinguished in the war. He is represented to have been a man of good sense and humane disposition.2 In 1714, the paper money which then flooded New England, and was much depreciated, was found to be a serious evil. Pro jects for relief excited unhappy divisions. One party favored a specie currency, another a bank, where capital stock should be real estate, and the third, which was the predominant party, induced the Legislature to authorize a loan of bills to any one, on time, upon notes secured by real estate. This question is said to have \" divided towns, parishes, and particular families.\"3 At the lower falls on the Androseoggin, in Brunswick, Fort George was erected in 1715, and the succeeding year at the mouth of the Kennebec was incorporated a town of twenty -six families, named Georgetown, in honor of George the First, who was crowned two years previously. Richard Wharton who had succeeded to the title of the Pejep scot Patent, having deceased, insolvent, his administrator sold the patent in 1714 to a number of gentlemen, of whom Dr. Oliver Noyes was one.

Capt. John Penhallow had taken up his residence there, and Samuel Penhallow says, in his Indian wars published in 1726, that so great was the encouragement given, \" that several towns, as Brunswick, Topsham, Georgetown and Cushnoc began to be settled.\"1 A vessel, called the Pejepscot, sailed between Boston and Augusta, and Noyes was engaged in the sturgeon fishery, which he carried on extensively \"in the several branches of the Sagadahoc.\" The village continued flourishing until Lovewell's war, when it was abandoned, and the fort and dwellings burned by the Indians.2 In 1716 Yorkshire, which reached to the Kennebec, was ex tended to the St. Croix, and at York, its only shire-town, the courts were held and the registry of deeds was kept. At this time the Fort at Pemaquid was ordered to be repaired and garri soned. As a means of conciliating the Indians and counteracting the influence of the Jesuits government offered a salary of \u00a3150 to any missionary who would reside at Fort George, acquire the language of the natives and instruct them in religion. Induced by this offer Rev. Joseph Baxter of Medfield, Mass, came to the Kennebec and labored in 1717 and 1718 and again in 1721. His presence was viewed with jealousy by Rasle, who used his influ ence to prevent the Indians from attending his instructions. On the 9th of August, 1717, a conference was held by the authorities of Massachusetts with eight of the principal chiefs of the Indian tribes at Georgetown, which finally resulted in the consent of the Indians to confirm existing treaties, and to allow the English to settle at their former places of settlement. The Indians declared they \" should be well pleased with King George if there never was a fort in the eastern parts.\" 3 'Penhallow was mistaken in relation to Cushnoc, for a settlement was not begun until the erection of Fort Western in 1754. 2 John McKeen, Records of Pejepscot Co., 2 Williamson, 90, who erroneously locates Augusta at Cushnoc.

It was not large or firmly built, and was the first attempt to hold the country above Merrymeeting by a garrisoned fortress.1 About this time St. George's fort was built on St. George's river. It consisted of two large block houses, with a covered way to the water, and a large area between them enclosed by palisades, and was capable of holding two hundred and fifty men.2 The conflicting titles to lands on the Kennebec strongly influ enced the early settlement of the river. Questions first arose as to the validity of European grants and titles by Indian deeds, both frequently covering the same or parts of the same territory. Polit ical considerations entered somewhat into the determination of these questions. The colony of Massachusetts, in 1633, prohibited the purchase of lands from the Indians within the limits of the colony without the consent of the government. But when, in 1643, they pro posed to extend their limits as far east as Casco Bay, they encour aged individuals in unlicensed purchases of the natives in the Province of Maine. This alarmed the colony of Plymouth, who feared that the Indian deeds might be held paramount to English grants, and in the latter year they prohibited purchases of the natives within the limits of their colony and their patent on the Kennebec. To maintain their right to the Kennebec lands and prevent the evils which might arise from purchases from the Indians, they established, in 1654, on their patent on the Kenne bec a civil government under Thomas Prince one of their princi pal men.3 In the year 1649, John Richards purchased \" Jeremysquam \" of Robinhood. The same year John Parker purchased Parker's Island of an Indian named Damaze, with all the land on the west side of the river from the sea up to Winnegance Creek. The lands on Arrowsic were sold, in 1660, to Roger Spencer and Thomas Clark. Kennebis and Abbagadassett sold to Spencer and Clark all the lands on the Kennebec river, ten miles on each side and up to Neguamkeag and Ticonic falls. 1 Eaton's Ann. 32; 2 Will. 97. 3 Sullivan's History, 141 \u2014 3. 2 2 Will. 97."], [39, "1719. European Grants. \u2014 Decisions of Courts. 19 In 1654, Robinhood sold the town of Woolwich to Edward Bateman and John Brown. The town is now held under this Indian title. The sale to Thomas Purchase upon the Androscoggin, in 1654 has already been noticed.1 Swan Island was sold, in 1667, to Humphrey Davie, by Abba gadassett. Kennebis, in 1649, conveyed to Christopher Lawsoh the land on the Kennebec up to Ticonic falls. This was assigned by Lawson, in 1653, to Clark and Lake. The deed to Lawson is said to have been obtained under the countenance of the people and govern ment of Massachusetts, to oppose New Plymouth in their claim of an exclusive right to the trade and fishery of the river.2 The Indians in making their grants had not the European idea of property. The exclusive right to the lands granted they could not comprehend. To peaceably possess and enjoy, with themselves and others, was all the right which they intended to convey. Hence the same lands were conveyed to different persons, with conflicting boundaries, and to increase the confusion they covered the grants made by the crown and the Council of Plymouth, which resulted in innumerable lawsuits. To escape from these diffi culties the courts came to the conclusion that where there had been actual entries and ancient settlements these should be pre ferred to any other title. This decision must have been based on the idea that neither party making the grants had a right to sell. This only increased the litigation, when it was further decided that when there had been no actual entries or ancient possessions the European titles should have the preference. This principle established the proprietors of the Plymouth or Kennebec Patent in the right to a large tract of country. The idea however of actual entries and ancient possessions being paramount to Indian or European grants suggested the holding against both by mere possession.3 During the brief interval of peace which followed the treaty of 1713, proprietors of land on the Kennebec again turned their attention to their possessions. The Pejepscot proprietors who had recently acquired the title to their patent and were looking to its extent, caused the Kennebec to be surveyed by Joseph Heath, whose plan bears date Brunswick, May 16, 1719.

As there was at this period a well settled peace between France and England, the Canadians did not take an open part in the war. The first act of hostility was by a party of sixty Canibas and Anasagunticook Indians, in twenty canoes, on the North margin of Merrymeeting bay, where, June 13th, they took nine families, who were seized \"as reprisals.\" But five men, however, were re tained for the safe return of four Indians, who were held at Boston by the English. At Pemaquid and Damariscove a number of per sons were killed ; and St. George's was surprised by two hundred Indians, and the proprietors' sloop, mills and a number of houses burned, one man killed and six taken prisoners. A vigorous attack upon the fort was repelled. Fort George, at Brunswick, was attacked and the settlement at that place reduced to ashes. But the Indians in their retreat were overtaken by Capt. John Harman with a company of thirty-four men, who administered severe chastisement by killing fifteen of their number. On the 25th of December of the next year the fort at St. George's river was attacked by sixty Indians, who were encour aged by the defenceless condition of the garrison to besiege it, which they did for thirty days, when it was relieved by Col. Westbrook of Kennebec. An assault was made upon Arrowsic by four or five hundred St. Francis and Mickmak Indians. The inhabitants retired to the fort. One man only was killed, and he by a shot through a port hole ; but fifty head of cattle were destroyed and twenty-six houses burned. In their retreat the Indians visited Fort Rich mond, which was under the command of Capt. Heath, and offered the garrison a \"profusion of insult,\" and then proceeded to their headquarters at Norridgewock. It was in this war that Noyes' Augusta at Small Point harbor 1 Williamson 2, p. 99."], [45, "1724.

This was accomplished by a detachment of two hundred and eight men, under Capts. Moulton, Harman and others, who left Fort Richmond, their place of rendezvous, on the 19th of August, 1724, in seventeen whale boats. The next day they arrived at Ticonic, where they left their boats, and marching through the woods arrived at Norridgewock on the 22d with such secrecy and expedition as to fully surprise the Indians, who fell an easy prey to an overpowering force. Rasle was killed while firing from a wigwam. A number of noted chiefs of the Canibas fell, and the village with the chapel of the Jesuit was reduced to ashes. On the 27th the detachment arrived at Fort Richmond on their return, without the loss of a man. This war was concluded by signing the celebrated \" Dummer's Treaty,\" December 15, 1725. The treaty was fully ratified at Falmouth in August of the next year. At the close of this war government took immediate measures to perpetuate peace and conciliate the Indians. To this end trad ing-houses were established at Fort St. George's and Fort Rich mond, at which articles of prime necessity, with a few gewgaws, were kept. The articles were purchased in quantity by govern ment at wholesale, and the keepers, who were called \"Truck masters,\" were chosen annually by the General Court, with special reference to their qualifications for conciliating the Indians, and were instructed to sell at an advance upon prime cost only suffi cient to cover freight and waste ; and full value was paid the Indians for their furs and skins. Presents were frequently made the Indians, and when employed they were liberally rewarded. Occasionally they were entertained, in the name of the govern ment, at the public charge. This considerate and kind treatment soon won the Indians and made them tranquil. They soon found that they could purchase commodities better and cheaper than in Canada, and were drawn away from French influence. Fort George, at Brunswick, was repaired, and that place was among the first to be resettled after the war. Sabbatis, a neigh boring Sagamore, requested government to keep supplies at the fort, for, said he, in \"cold winters and deep snows my Indians, unable to go to Fort Richmond, sometimes suffer.\" It is noticeable"], [46, "1732. Settlement Discouraging.\u2014 Missionaries. 26 that the Indians were permitted to become indebted in consider able sums to the trading-houses, and they became a tax on the province. Notwithstanding the tranquility of the Indians, the settlement of the country was attended for some years with many discour agements. The grant of lots offered by proprietors for slight settling duties was not sufficient to induce individuals to make a beginning in a wilderness without associates. A sudden rupture might arise with the Indians, and settlers could not well be spared from the older towns. Proprietors were inactive in improving their land. They were full of plans of plantations, projects of sale and speculation, which rather retarded than promoted the settlement and improvement of the country. In 1732 the governor of Massachusetts made a visit, with a large retinue, as far east as St. George's. Having previously conferred with the Indians at Falmouth, he informed them that three missionaries of the \" society for promoting Christian know ledge \" were intended for the province, and that the General Court had granted them \u00a3100 annually on condition of their officiating as chaplains to the garrisons. One of them was to reside at St. George's, one at Fort Richmond, and the other at Cushnoc, now Augusta, where a town and church were about to be built. The complaints of the Indians were heard and redress promised, and the governor recommended the rebuilding of the fort at St. George's, which was in a state of decay.1 Peace being now established, proprietors of lands turned their attention to the formation of new settlements. Gen. Waldo, patentee of the lands at St. George's river, paid a visit to that section in April, 1735, when he held a conference with the Indians and gained their apparent consent to his intended settlements on the river. A number of people attracted from various quarters by Gen. Waldo's liberal offers, met him at the fort and agreed to set tle on his lands. They were of the same origin, and were located in the same neighborhood. All were from the north of Ireland, of the Protestant religion, originally descended from Scotch families who emigrated to Ireland at an early period. They were called Scotch-Irish, but could not speak or understand the Irish lan guage. Seven of their number, of whom James Howard, after wards commander at Fort Western, was one, had been previously 1 Eaton's Ann. p. 47."], [47, "1735.

Twenty-seven persons now entered into a contract with Gen. Waldo, dated at St. George's fort, April 18, 1735, to settle on his lands. James Howard and Samuel Howard, his brother, and John North,1 who was the father of Col. Joseph North and Gen. William North of New York, and David Patterson, an ancestor of the Pattersons now resident in Augusta, were of the number. The next year the settlers, having determined their several pos sessions by lot, located themselves. James Howard had lot No. 17, Samuel Howard No. 18, David Patterson No. 35, and John North No. 48. They erected log houses of one room, near the banks of the river. \" In one corner of this room a large fire-place was con structed, by erecting the back and one jamb of stone, cemented with clay or lime, having a post of wood at the opposite angle supporting a mantel-tree and cross timber of the same material. All above this was constructed of cat-and-clay, that is, clefts of wood laid up cob-house fashion with interstices filled and sides plastered with clay morter.\"2 In 1735 a new valuation of taxable property was made and a tax of \u00a31,000 assessed. The nine towns in Maine, which were all west of the Kennebec, were assessed \u00a346.07.02 of this tax. No place upon the Sagadahoc or the Kennebec or its tributary waters was assessed. The war between Great Britain and Spain caused government to turn its attention to the protection of the eastern country, and \u00a33,000 was appropriated in June, 1740, to put it in a state of defence. Fort Richmond, among other forts, was made defensi ble. But at this time every new demand upon the empty treasury created no small embarrassment. Bills of credit remained unpaid to the amount of \u00a3200,000. In this emergency the novel project of a \" Land Bank \" was adopted by the General Court, but through the opposition of the governor, and finally by act of Parliament, it was defeated. The General Court, in August, 1741, presented the governor with a bill for the emission of bills to the amount of \u00a336,000 'Eaton's Ann. p. 51. 2Ib. p. 55."], [48, "Settlement at St. George's Abandoned. 1744. 28 sterling, to be paid at future periods, in gold and silver, or \"in articles of country produce.\" This he refused to sign on account of the last clause, when it was modified to suit the \"land bank party,\" and was generally acceptable. The act provided that \" bills of a new form \" should be issued ; that every twenty shillings expressed on the face of them should be equal to three ounces of silver ; that all contracts should be payable in silver at 6s. 8d. the ounce, or gold in proportion, and that the bills should be received in all public and private payments accordingly. These bills were denominated \"New Tenor,\" to distinguish them from prior emissions ; but they gradually depreciated to a level with the old bills, and in 17441 were called \" Old Tenor.\"2 The apprehensions which were generally entertained that France would join Spain in the war against England, and that the flames of war would be enkindled on this side of the ocean between the provinces of those nations, were fully realized in the spring of 1744. No sooner was it known that France and Eng land had declared war than the French colonists and the Indians in their interest began to concert plots against their English neighbors, who were not less active, and were more successful in counter plotting. During this war, in 1745, the settlement at St. George's was broken up and many of the settlers joined the expedition to Louisbourg. Some went to Boston, Pemaquid, and other places, to reside until the war was over.3 John North removed to Pem aquid, and the Howards probably returned to Boston. After the establishment of peace, in 1749, many of the settlers returned, among whom were Samuel Howard and James Howard, who was accompanied by his son John, who probably had then become of age. Eaton mentions John North as having returned,4 but it is quite probable that he remained at Pemaquid, in connec tion with the fort of which he was afterwards commander for many years. In February, 1754, the clerk of the Plymouth company was directed to \"write Capt. John North of Pemaquid to fence the marsh on the west side of Damariscotta river, which he hath im proved for hco years past,\"6 and in his deposition, taken April 14, 1753, he is stated as resident at Pemaquid Fort.6 1 Prov.

Peace October 7, 1748. 29 It was during this war that the brilliant affair of the cap ture of Louisbourg was achieved, to the great joy of America and the astonishment of Europe. It was hoped that this great success would deter the Indians from engaging in the war, and measures were taken to inform them of it ; but under the influence of the French, their eagerness for war, which commenced with them in 1745, was increased. The French and English terminated the war by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, October 7, 1748, but it was not until October 16th of the next year that the Indians signed a treaty, at Falmouth, upon which the names of eight chiefs of the Canibas tribe appear. The expenses of this war had largely increased the indebted ness of the Province. It was ascertained that about \u00a32,200,000 in bills of credit were outstanding, which had depreciated so that an ounce of silver would purchase 50s. of the old tenor, or 12s. 6d. of the new tenor bills, and a Spanish milled dollar 45s. of the one and 11s. 3d. of the other. The Geneial Court determined to redeem the bills aud establish a specie currency exclusively. Having received from England the sum of \u00a3183,649, 2s. 7Jd. to reimburse the Province for her expenses in the Louisbourg expedition, it was a favorable time to carry into effect this determination. The sum, however, was not sufficient for the purpose. To supply the deficiency a tax of \u00a375,000 sterling was laid upon the Province, which was allowed to be paid in the bills, at the rate of 45s. old tenor, or 11s. 3d. new tenor, for every Spanish milled dollar, now called 6s. lawful money, or 4s. 6d. sterling. All pecuniary contracts after March 31, 1750 were to be paid in coin or specie, at the rate of 6s. 8d. in silver, by the ounce.1 Many were clamorous against the measure, prophesying evil, but most of the bills were redeemed in the course of fifteen months, and were afterwards uncurrent.

FROM THE CLOSE OF THE SPANISH WAR IN 1748 TO THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR IN 1755. The Plymouth or Kennebec Patent is the source of all the land titles from the north lines of Topsham and Woolwich to above Norridgewock. It is proposed to consider some of the measures of the company which owned this large tract of land in promoting the early settlement of the Kennebec valley. From the time when New Plymouth sold the patent, in 1661, to 1749, a period of eighty-eight years, the title remained dormant, and no effort had been made to settle the lands. The reasons for this are found in the public events already narrated. At the last mentioned period the four original purchasers were dead, aud the proprietors were greatly increased in number, somewhat scattered, and not fully known to each other, still less did they know of the value of their land or its extent. During the short peace following the various national and Indian wars, the prospect of settling the lands appeared favor able, and a number of proprietors, on the 17th day of August, 1749, joined in a petition to \" the worshipful John Storer, Esq., one of his Magisties Justices of the Peace for the county of York \" to call a meeting of the proprietors of the Plymouth Com pany's lands, \"they judging it necessary, in order to choose a clerk, and appoint a committee to settle or divide the same as the major part of the proprietors shall or may agree.\" Storer issued his warrant, directed to Samuel Goodwin, one of the proprietors, to notify a meeting for the 21st of September, 1749, at the Royal Exchange Tavern in Boston.

Lands offered to Settlers. 31 On the 19th of December following the first vote was passed relating to the settlement of their lands, and a committee consist ing of Samuel Goodwin of Charlestown and Jabez Fox of Fal mouth was directed to employ a surveyor to lay out a township near \" Commeseconte.\" At a subsequent meeting direction was given to take Benjamin Pratt's advice as to the bounds of the patent and proceedings of the meetings, and a committee was chosen \" to examine into everything which concerns said pro prietee, and to prepare everything agreeable to Mr. Pratt's in structions.\" Additions were afterwards made to this committee, which became the executive or \"Grand Committee.\" A survey and plan of the patent were subsequently ordered, and another town directed to be laid out opposite the first. Robert Temple was directed to write Capt.

The towns on each side of the Kennebec had not yet been laid out, and direction was given anew for their location ; and the terms of settlement were to be made known by advertisements.1 Great care had been taken by government at the close of the war with the Indians, in 1749, to keep them tranquil. Trading houses were again opened at St. George's, and Fort Richmond, and all private traffic with the tribes was forbidden. Trade and business began to revive in Maine. The eastern people, as the inhabitants were called, had been engaged in ship building. About thirty-five years previous, schooners were first built. They were found to be more valuable in the cod fisheries than sloops, and large numbers were built. The articles which the country afforded were lumber, potash, pitch, furs and fish, which were uniformly quick in market, and were readily exchanged for pork, breadstuff's and merchandise, all of which afforded profit able freight for their vessels.2 The Canibas tribe of Indians, notwithstanding they had been much diminished by wars, still retained their enmity to the whites. An unfortunate affair occurred at Wiscasset, December 2, 1749, which aroused these Indians and alarmed the inhabitants. This was a quarrel between several whites and some of the Canibas ' 1 Book Plymouth Co. Records. 22 Williamson, 264."], [53, "1750. Fort Richmond Attacked. A tribe, in which one Indian was killed and two badly wounded. This took place within six weeks after the treaty at Falmouth, and before peace had become firmly settled. Three of the whites engaged in the affray were taken into custody, two escaped, and one was tried and convicted of felony. The country at this time was poorly prepared to meet the increasing disquietude of the Indians. Fort Richmond was gar risoned with but fourteen men ; at Pemaquid there were six ; at St. George's fifteen, and at Fort George, Brunswick, four. In this state for defence rumors that the Indians were moving to attack Fort Richmond reached that fort. On the 11th of Septem ber, 1750, about one hundred northern Indians came with some young Canibas warriors and assaulted the fort with \"great fury.\" The Indians were ignorant of its weakness, and spent the day in spoiling some habitations in the vicinity. In this emergency, Capt. Samuel Goodwin, with a small party of men who were probably in the employment of the Kennebec Company came to their relief, and gained the fort under cover of night. Informed of the rein forcement by a prisoner, the Indians left, and forming into parties committed depredations on both sides of the river. A small party crossed the river to Frankfort, now Dresden, and shot Mr. Pomeroy dead as he was entering the door of his house. Mr. Davis who was in an apartment of the same house sprang to the door to close it, when an Indian thrust in the barrel of his gun to prevent its shutting. Davis seized this, and with the assistance of some women wrested it from the savage, who took a young child of Davis' and carried it away captive. Another party visited Swan Island, burning houses and killing cattle, and when they lest carried away thirteen or\" fourteen of the inhabitants prisoners. The main body of the Indians proceeded down the river, and dividing into scouts visited Parker's Island, in Georgetown, and Wiscasset. At the latter place they took two prisoners and burned several houses. At Georgetown they commenced their attack with hatchets on the door of a house on Parker's Island. The owner bravely resisted till they had cut through the door, when he leaped from a back window, and being pursued, took to the water swimming for Arrowsick Island. His pursuers sprang into a canoe and gained upon him. When almost within their reach he turned upon them, like a stag at bay, upset their bark canoe, throwing them into the water.

Of these were some of James Whidden's family. His house was surrounded early in the morning by about twenty Indians, who entered, allowing Whidden and his wife only time to escape in their night clothes to the cellar, where they remained secreted. His two sons were taken captive and sold in Canada, where one died from hardships, and the other was returned by the interven tion of government broken in health. His daughter, Abigail, who married Lazarus Noble, was taken with her husband and seven children from fourteen years down to eight months old, and a man and maid servant. They were in captivity in May, 1751, when Whidden memorialized the General Court in relation to their redemption, stating, \"that it is with great concern of mind he understands that great care and pains are taken by the French, to whom they were sold, to initiate his grandchildren into ye Romish Principles, and by all the motives of Charity and Compassion to their souls as well as bodies he is obliged to pray and seek for their liberty and redemption.\" As he was not able to be at the charge of their ransom he prayed the General Court to furnish him aid for that purpose.2 A conference was held in August, at Fort St. George's, when the assembled Indians were induced to confirm their treaty. But at this conference no delegate from the Canibas tribe appeared. The Plymouth Company called a meeting, under a new warrant, for September 5, 1751, 3 at which fourteen proprietors were repre sented. Samuel Goodwin was, at this meeting, directed to get the land and islands surveyed which were omitted in the last survey, also to let one or two mill privileges and 1,000 acres of land for ten years, on any stream emptying into Merrymeeting bay, to any person for one-third or one-fourth of the lumber the mills may saw.

These lots were twenty-four in number, reaching to the south line of Augusta. His plan upon which they are delineated is dated February 3, 1753. The grant of a township made to Jones and others embraced five of these lots. But liberal as were the terms the grantees were not able to comply with them. At this time there were but eleven towns in Maine, which upon a new valuation and assessment it was found had increased but slightly in population for the seven years previous. An important alteration was now made in the calendar. It was found \"that by consequence of small increments during along series of years the computation of time was incorrect.\" Parlia ment therefore passed an act, January 22, 1752, ordaining that every year including the then present year should commence with January 1st instead of March 25th, and that eleven days be expunged from the calendar, and that September 3d of that year be called the 14th.

The Indians complained loudly of the encroachments of the settlers, and were uneasy and ill-tempered. The French still claimed to the Kennebec, and were disposed to insist on their claim. The English government was treating with them for the establishment of their territorial limits in America ; but during the protracted negotiations the French had conceived the design of establishing a line of forts from the 1 Eaton's Ann. 80."], [58, "1 753. Valley of the Kennebec. 38 St. Lawrence, along the lakes, through the Ohio country, ending only at New Orleans, and had already built about thirty of these in the disputed territory. In 1753, commissioners had an interview with some of the Indians of the Canibas tribe at Fort Richmond. They appeared to be disaffected because settlements were begun above the fort, and alleged that their fathers never intended to deprive them and their children of their hunting grounds; still if they were unmo lested they would be tranquil. The French refused to liberate the captives which they held in Canada, and had commenced settlements on the Chaudiere. The Canibas Indians had said, at Fort Richmond, that they had given French settlers full permission to live and hunt on their lands in order that they might furnish them with provisions and military stores when they should be again at war with the English. The valley of the Kennebec was liable to Indian incursions from its easy access by Indian trails or carrying-places, those \" century trod \" paths of the natives. The Penobscots came by way of Marsh river which joins the Penobscot at Frankfort, the twenty five mile pond and stream in Unity, and the Sebasticook river ; also by way of Owl's Head, St. George's river, and Sheepscot and Eastern rivers. It was by this latter route that John McKeen thought it probable Du Mont reached the Kennebec from Pema quid, in 1604, and then considered it an interior river. The sources of the Kennebec and the west branch of the Penob scot interlock with the head waters of the Chaudiere by the Du Loup and Lake Megantic. The Penobscot takes its rise near the source of the Du Loup and runs slightly north of east, near lo and past the northerly end of Moosehead lake. Dead river, a branch of the Kennebec, rises but a short distance from the head of the Androscoggin, and not far from a tributary- of Lake Megan tic ; while the Androscoggin, in its meandering course to the Kennebec, passes into New Hampshire, where it receives tribu taries from the west which interlock with branches of the Con necticut. The head waters of the Kennebec were connected with the waters of the Chaudiere by Indian portages, some knowledge of which Du Mont undoubtedly obtained from the natives at the early period of his visit to the river. Montresor, an English officer of engineers, penetrated Maine from Quebec, in 1760, as far as Fort Halifax. He came by way of the Chaudiere, Du Loup, Penobscot and Moosehead lake, to the"], [59, "1753. Indian Portages. \u2014 Plymouth Patent. A Kennebec, and returned by Dead river and Lake Megantic. He was accompanied by Indians who were familiar with the routes and portages. They found numerous beaver dams on the small streams, some of which they opened in order to raise the water to float their birch canoes. One beaver dam is mentioned, on a branch of the Penobscot which they ascended on their way to Moosehead lake, of the almost incredible height of ten feet. The journal of this officer, which came to Arnold's hands, first suggested to him his celebrated expedition to Quebec.1 It was by Montresor's routes that the Canadian Indians reached the Kennebec, and the Jesuits who resided with the Canibas tribe communicated with the civil government and their religious supe riors in Canada. The Anasagunticook Indians, residing on the Androscoggin, had easy access to the Kennebec by that river. A portage which passed from the foot of the falls in Brunswick over what is now main street in that town to the waters of Casco bay,* and the portage from Merrymeeting bay to New Meadows river, furnished facilities for the western Indians who came by the way of the coast to reach the Kennebec, and the eastern and northern Indians to reach Casco bay. At a meeting held June 27th, 1753, Robert Temple, Dr. Gardiner and David Jeffries were appointed a committee to wait on Benja. Pratt, to know what he would require \"as a proper fee, to pre pare every thing necessary for establishing the grant from the Council of Plymouth to the Plymouth Company, and the purchases from the Indians, to be sent to Florentius Vassall our agent, with all convenient speed.\"' These papers were probably prepared\u00bbby Pratt, as they were forwarded by the ship Halifax, John Phillips commander, to the care of Vassall, and are now found in a manu script volume in the British Museum, and are entitled \" Papers relating to the case of the Kennebec River, Maine, 1752, 1762.\" Among them is the Patent of the late Colony of Plymouth, which was lost for many years. \"Great search was made for it in 1727;\" also in 1733 and again in 1741. \"At length Perez Bradford, Esq., was desired to inquire and with much difficulty procured it, it hav ing been designedly concealed.\" 4 This loss and recovery are con firmed by the fuller account given by Rev. Jacob Bailey in a manu- 1 Montresor's Jour. M. II. Soc.

The patent was lost, but by unweari ed efforts and great expense he at length found it in the hands of Samuel Wells, Esq., a commissioner for settling the boundary line between the Colony of Plymouth and that of Rhode Island. It had been long concealed by an \"ancient woman, who hoped to make some ad\\ antage to herself by the possession.\" It was obtained from her by strategem and delivered to the commis sioner, who upon order of the General Court, obtained by Good win, resigned the patent. Goodwin then prevailed with a number of gentlemen to be concerned by purchase, and \"Bowdoin, Vas sall, Hancock, Gardiner, Hallowell and other wealthy persons were engaged, and the first meeting was held agreeably to a warrant in 1749.\" ' This account was undoubtedly derived from Goodwin who was Bailey's near neighbor at Pownalborough. Only Mr. Bowdoin of the persons named was present at the first meeting, but the others came in not long after. Among the documents in the British Museum is \"The case of the Kennebec Company, transcribed for the Attorney General, with a fee of five guineas.\" This is dated September 8, 1755; a memorandum states, \" Sept. 15 it was laid before him\" \u2014 the Attorney General \u2014 with \"two additional queries, and a fee of two guineas.\" The Plymouth Company held their fourth meeting October 17th, 1752, which was continued by adjournments to September 12th, 1753. Dr. Sylvester Gardiner was chosen moderator. He had first appeared at the meetings December 6th 1751. At this meet ing three townships of five miles square on North's plan were granted on condition of introducing into each one hundred settlers in three years. The first was to John Stedman, merchant, of Rot terdam ; the second to Henry E. Luther, Counsellor of State, at Frankfort, in Germany, upon River Mayne ; and the third to Ger shom Flagg, one of the proprietors. These grants were not effective on account of the difficulty of obtaining settlers. However, Luther, previous to this, in 1750, had become a correspondent with the General Assembly, who 1 Frontier Miss. 247."], [61, "1754. Indians to be Quieted. 41 desired to introduce foreign protestants, and had signified to him that his assistance to those persons who were entering into contracts for that purpose would be kindly received. Luther proposed many plans and was at much expense to encourage emigration, but his efforts resulted in disappointment to himself, the province, and the emigrants who arrived.1 The township of Frankfort had been lotted, the \"defensible house\" built and named Fort Shirley in compliment to the Gov ernor of Massachusetts, and settlers had established themselves on their grants, twenty-six of which were made from the 11th day of June, 1753, to the 30th of July of the same year. It was found that the fort was overlooked by a hill, and Samuel Goodwin was granted a lot to build \"a defensible house\" on the hill. The town ship to Jones, Melvin and Frye, who were proprietors, was re granted to them and set out with great particularity on the records. The title from King James the First, through mesne con veyances to the proprietors, was fully stated, with all the conditions fully set out, and lengthy reservations for municipal purposes, with sundry provisions in case of Indian wars. But it was to little purpose, for the conditions of the grant were not complied with. The standing committee were directed to write Samuel Good win who had become the commander of Fort Shirley, to sound and ascertain the depth of water in the river between Cobbossee contee and Cushnoc. This was probably with a view to the erec tion of a fort at the latter place. The Indians continued to be uneasy in relation to the settle ments the proprietors) were making, and Capt. William Lithgow of Fort Richmond, and Samuel Goodwin, \"who was appointed to carry on the settlements at Kennebec,\" were requested to quiet them. James Pitts was directed to supply Goodwin \" with one Barrel of Rum, to treat the Indians that go to Frankfort, to make them easy.\" 2 The unsatisfactory state of affairs with France, and the facility of passing from Canada with Indian forces to the Kennebec by way of the Chaudiere, increased the apprehension that some place on the upper waters of those rivers might be a general rendezvous of the Indians, and that peace could not long continue. At length Governor Shirley received information from Capt. Lithgow, at Fort Richmond, that the French were building a fort 1 Hutchinson's History, 11. 22 Book Plymouth Co. Records, 26."], [62, "42 French to be Warned off. 1754. at a \" noted carrying place of the Indians,\" on the head waters of the Kennebec,1 and on the 8th day of February, 1754, he commis sioned John North, Captain of the fort at Pemaquid, and Thomas Fletcher, Lieutenant of the fort at St. George's river, to proceed thither with a sufficient armed guard, and require any chief officer thus engaged to remove with his soldiers off the ground, as being within the jurisdiction of His Majesty the King of Great Britain, and gave them special instructions to govern them in the matter.2 In a letter to Capt. North of the same date accompanying the commission, Gov. Shirley urged upon him the necessity of expe dition so that he could return before the \" Rivers break up \" and in season to lay \"this affair before the General Assemby in the latter end of March.\" He charged him \"to exercise the greatest discretion,\" and remarked, \"If this design is managed prudently and successfully it will do honor to those concerned in the execu tion of it.\" In the same month a party of sixty Indians appeared before Fort Richmond. They came as spies, as was supposed, and were insulting and threatening, saying the English had better leave the river or their French brothers would come in the spring, clad as Indians, and drive them away. The French were active in persuading the Indians to prevent further settlements on the river, promising favor to those who should unite with them, and threatening vengeance on all who should mediate between the English and the Indians.3 In the emergency which was arising the General Court4 de clared its \"readiness to do everything that could be expected, and looked upon it to be of absolute necessity that the French should at all events be prevented from making any settlement whatsoever at the River Kennebec or the carryiug places at its head.\" As Richmond fort was in a decayed state, the House desired the governor to cause a new fort to be erected, about one hundred and twenty feet square, as far above that fort as should be thought expedient, and cause the garrison, artillery, and stores at Richmond to be removed to the new fort and the old fort to be demolished ; and likewise to order a sufficient force to the carry ing place to remove the French that may be settled there. The House .also requested the governor to take a voyage in person to 1 Mass. Council Ree. vol. 2. p. 327. 3 Williamson, 297. 2 Shirley's Commission. 4Jour. of House o 4 Jour, of House of Rep.

Governor Shirley's Letter. 43 the eastern parts of the Province ; and to protect his person, erect a fort, and destroy encroaching settlements of Lhe French, they made provision for the pay and subsistence of five hundred men, which force was afterwards increased to eight hundred.1 The Plymouth Company being desirous that Fort Richmond should be removed or another fort built further up the river, Gov ernor Shirley addressed them a letter proposing the erection of the new fort at Ticonic,2 if they would construct one at Cushnoc. The reasons and advantages of this arrangement are fully set forth in the following letter addressed by the Governor to the Plymouth proprietors : \" Boston, April 16, 1754. Gentlemen: \u2014 The Great and General Assembly of this province having in their present Session by their Message to me desired that I would order \"a new fort to be erected of about one hundred and twenty feet square, as far up the river Kennebec above Rich mond fort as I shall think fit;\" and whereas the placing such a fort upon this occasion near Taconett Falls, would contribute more to the defence of the said river and protection of the settlements which already are, or shall hereafter be made upon it, than erect ing a fort at or near Cushenac, but would be attended with this inconvenience, that the depth of water in said river will not admit provisions and stores to be transported in a sloop higher than Cushenac; so that it is necessary in case a fort shall be erected at Taconett Falls, that a strong defensible magazine should be built at Cushenac for the reception of the Government stores and pro visions in. their carriage to the said fort ; I think it proper to acquaint you, that in case you shall forthwith at the expense of your proprietee cause to be built at or near Cushenac upon the said river, as I shall order, a house of hewn timber not less than ten inches thick, one hundred feet long and thirty-two feet wide, and sixteen feet high, for the reception of the province's stores, with conveniences for lodging the soldiers who may be placed there by the Government; and will picquet in the same at thirty feet distant from every part of the house ; and build a block house of twenty-four feet square, at two of the opposite angles, agree- ' Answer of both Houses. 8th vol.

John North to send a 1 3 Book Ken. Co. Records, 63-65."], [65, "1754.

If they meet with Indians they are not to offer any violence, only in self defence, and are to press forward.\" \\ Previous to this, Capt. Joseph Bane of York, had been despatched, April 11th, by the Governor with directions to pro ceed to the Kennebec, and there ascertain if the French are build ing a fort ; to report the result to Capt. Lithgow of Fort Rich mond, and to approach as near as possible without hazard ; to take special notice of the land lying near Kennebec river between Cushnoc and Ticonic, and especially near Ticonic falls, and also observe the falls ; and how far it is practicable, and in what manner, to carry provisions and other goods from Cushnoc and Ticonic.2 The necessary forces having been raised and put under the command of Gen. John Winslow, Governor Shirley, with a quorum L>i' his Council and other functionaries of government, embarked on the 21st of June, in the Province frigate Massachusetts, for Falmouth, now Portland, the place of rendezvous, where upon his arrival he found the commissioners of New Hampshire with some Penobscot and forty-two Canibas Indians from Norridge wock. The Governor told the Canibas chiefs that he had concluded to build a fort at Ticonic, to which they strongly objected until they were shown the deeds by which the territory had been con veyed from them, when they gave their consent and signed a treaty.3 The forces were immediately sent on the projected enterprise of building the fort. Five hundred of the troops were to ascend the Kennebec to reconnoitre the head waters and great carrying place.' The remainder were to build the fort according to the plan and dimensions given.4 Governor Shirley soon followed the forces to the Kennebec, which he first ascended to Ticonic, and concluded to erect the fort \" on a fork of land formed by the Kennebec and Sebasticook ; 1 Records of Letters, vol. 4, p. 298. ' Letters, vol. 4, p. 291. 3 Williamson 2, p. 300. 4 Shirley's Messages, vol. 1, Messages and Speeches, p. 625."], [66, "Fort Halifax Located. 1754. 46 the latter emptying into the former about three-fourths of a mile from Taconett Falls.\" In regard to this location he remarks: \"The only known communication which the Penobscots have with the River Kennebec and the Norridgewock Indians is through the Sebasticook, which they cross within ten miles of Taconett Falls ; and their most commodious passage from Penobscot to Quebec is through the Kennebec to the River Chaudiere, so that a fort here cuts off the Penobscots not only from the Norridgewocks but also from Quebec ; and as it stands at a convenient distance to make a sudden and easy descent upon their head quarters, is a strong curb upon them as also upon the Norridgewocks.\"1 After locating the fort the Governor ascended the river about seventy-five miles to the great carrying place, explored the river on both sides and made a survey and plan of the route. The time occupied in performing this was ten days. He made no discovery of French settlements or any attempt to form settlements. Near the site of the fort on an eminence overlooking the country, he caused to be erected a redoubt twenty feet square, picketed in, and mounted it with two small cannon and a swivel, and \" garrisoned it with a sergeant's guard of twelve men.\"2 The Governor returned to Falmouth, and from thence to Boston, where he arrived on the ninth of September, and was met, as is said, \"with vivid congratulations.\" Gen. Winslow was left actively engaged in erecting the fort of hewed timber. He built a block house two stories high, with the lower story twenty feet square and the upper twenty-seven ; around this, at each angle, was placed one story buildings twenty feet square for barracks ; these were to be enclosed by palisades forming a square of one hundred and twenty feet, and the whole enclosed by eight hundred feet of palisades placed in a star form ; the sides of this outer palisade were each two hundred feet long, and were to be defended from central pro jections constructed for the purpose. The block house was mounted with \" several small cannon\" in the upper story which ranged over the other erections of the fort. The fort was nearly completed September 3d, when it was garrisoned by one hundred men under command of Capt. William Lithgow, and named Fort Halifax, out of respect to the Earl of Halifax, then Secretary of State. The plan and construction of this fort was very unsatis- 1 Shirley's Messages, vol. 1, Messages and Speeches, p. 625 2 1 vol. Messages and Speeches, p. 625."], [67, "1754.

Shirley and a vote of the company to build the fort. The main building, now standing in a good state of preservation just below the eastern end of Kennebec bridge, is one hundred feet long, thirty-two wide and sixteen high, and is built of timber making solid walls twelve inches thick. The two block houses constructed of heavy timber were twenty feet square, with projecting stories twenty-four feet square, and were covered with hip roofs, from the centres of which arose sentry boxes six feet square formed of oak plank and loop-holed for muskets. The upper stories of the block houses had slits for muskets and four port holes, each, for cannon. One of these block houses was placed at the southwest corner of the parade, so as to command the west and south side ; the other at the northeast corner to command the east and north side. At the opposite comers of the parade were placed sentry boxes twelve feet square built of timber, and a palisade between the buildings enclosed a parade one hundred and sixty feet long by sixty-two wide. Outside of this palisade, and thirty feet from it, was, on three sides, another palisade. On the fourth side, fronting the"], [69, ""], [70, ""], [71, "1754. Fort Shirley Supplied. 49 river, it was open, leaving a space of thirty feet from the inner palisade to the brow of the river bank. The doors of the main building were made of thick plank, and the windows furnished with shutters of the same material. Four cannon were mounted in the block houses, and a garrison of twenty men established by Governor Shirley, under command of James Howard. The fort was named Fort Western, from a gentleman of Gov. Shirley's acquaintance in Sussex, in England.1 A road was made between Forts Western and Halifax by order of Gov Shirley, fit for the passage of wheel carriages.2 This was probably the first military road of any considerable length con structed in Maine. The Governor also arranged by means of whale boats for the transmission of expresses from Fort Halifax to Fal mouth in twenty hours, and back again in twenty-four hours.3 The troops employed on this expedition, with the exception of those retained to garrison the forts, were discharged by October 17th, and the fear that the French would form settlements on the Kennebec or its tributary waters was allayed. The fifth meeting of the Plymouth proprietors was held Septem ber 20, 1753, aud was continued by adjournments for eight years to April 13, 1761, during which time William Bowdoin was mod erator. Some of the transactions of this meeting have been noticed in the preceding pages. Samuel Goodwin was instructed to obtain of the Norridgewock tribe a quit claim deed of the land for fifteen miles on each side of the Kennebec, from Wesserunsett to the ocean, if it could be obtained for \u00a350 lawful money. Advertisements were published warning all persons from pur chasing lands on the Kennebec except of the Plymouth proprie tors, \"if they would avoid the bad consequence thereof.\" Small arms were purchased and sent to Goodwin at Frankfort, who was authorized to procure half a barrel of good pistol powder, one hundred pounds of lead bullets, and five hundred good flints. He was also ordered to send up the \" Doctor's Box \" to be refilled ; and by the first opportunity was to be sent him one barrel of rum, one hundred pounds of cheese and two hundred pounds of bread, to enable him to cut the road proposed from Kennebec to Sheepscot river. This road was for the purpose of communicating with Frankfort by an open harbor on the Sheepscot when the Kennebec ' Hutchinson's History, p. 26. ' Shirley's Message, Oct. 18, 1754. 1 18 Council Records, p. 281. 1"], [72, "50 Clark and Lake's Claim. 1754. was closed with ice. Dr. Gardiner subsequently proposed that if the proprietors would grant him four hundred acres of land on the Sheepscot, he would build a house on the same and settle a family, and there \" station his sloop,\" which he had run to the Kennebec, when she could not on account of ice ascend that river. The pro posal was accepted and the grant made. All bonds, notes and mortgages for land sold were to be taken in the name of Robert Temple, Sylvester Gardiner, William Bow doin, James Bowdoin and Benjamin Hallowell, who were the standing committee. The)7 gave bond in the sum of \u00a320,000 to other members in trust to account annually for the same. One twenty -fourth part was now determined to be one full share of the Kennebec purchase. At this time the contest between rival landed proprietors on the Kennebec was just commencing. The Plymouth proprietors had been preparing for it. They were men of great sagacity, and Sullivan says had great influence with the government ; to them Shirley, the governor, was very attentive.1 Their advertisement, which has been already noticed, was answered by Cadwallador Ford, which drew out, the following defence prepared, probably, by James Bowdoin, who answered the Pejepscot proprietors :2 \"At a meeting May 29, 1754, Voted, That the following adver tisement be published in the newspapers : \" Whereas, Cadwallador Ford, Esq , in answer to an advertise ment signed by Mr. David Jeffries, clerk to this proprietee, informs the public, ' That he and others claim certain lands on Kennebec River under Clark and Lake, and have an indubitable title to them, by virtue of genuine deeds of sale, for valuable considera tion, from the Sachems of said River, and declares, that in conse-' quence thereof they have possessed and improved the same upwards of a hundred years, and expended \u00a320,000 sterling, in endeavoring to settle said lands, and had their title confirmed to them by a decree of the King in Council, about the year 1732, and further that he and company, at the Superior Court at York, in June last, recovered a judgment against Samuel Goodwin, who was agent to the Plymouth Company, in an action of Trespass,' &c. 1 Sullivan's History, p. 117. 2 The answer prepared by Mr. Bowdoin to the Brunswick proprietors was ordered to be printed. \u2014 2 Book Records."], [73, "1754. Purchases of Indians Prohibited. 51 \" In reply thereto, the Plymouth Company inform the public that the lands above referred to were within the jurisdiction of the late colony of Plymouth, whose laws strictly prohibited anyr purchases to be made of lands from the Indians without the consent of the General Court, on penalty of their being void, and those laws have been confirmed by an act of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, within which said lands now are, whereby it is enacted, ' That all deeds of land so within this Province obtained from any Indian or Indians, by any person or persons whatsover, at any time since the year 1633, without license of the respective General Courts of the late colonies \u2014 of the Massachusetts Bay and New Plymouth \u2014 in which such lands so lay, shall be deemed in the law to be null and void and of no effect,' and consequently Clark and Lake's Indian deeds which were all obtained long since 1633, however genuine they may be, or however valuable the consideration of them were, must be deemed null and void. \"As to their having possessed and improved said lands upwards of one hundred years, we would say, that it may be near or quite one hundred years since some of their Indian deeds were dated. but that is no proof, \u2014 though it be all the proof they have, \u2014 of their having possessed and improved said lands for such a length of time. \"With respect to what has been expended, it is necessary it should be known that Clark and Lake had a considerable trade at Arrowsick, and lost a great quantity of goods, and one of them his life, in the year 1676, when the Indians attacked that island. \" This loss they call \u00a320,000 sterling, and say it was so much expended in endeavoring to settle said lands. They are obliged to their brethren, the Brunswick proprietors, \u2014 so called, \u2014 for this account, and for their publishing it with a pompous one of their own expenses ; but they both turn out pretty much alike, for as the Brunswick proprietors lost considerable in prosecuting an ill concerted fishing scheme,1 and having placed it to the account of expenses in improving and settling the eastern lands, so Clark and Lake lost by the Indians a good deal more, which their successors charge to the same account ; but there is no merit in this. If losses of this sort are meritorious, the Plymouth Company have an abundant stock of merit. \"As to the decree of the king in council confirming their title, it 1 Probably Noyes' Augusta, see ante, p. 16."], [74, "52 Judgment against Goodwin. 1754. is such a decree as they will never think it worth while to produce. A hundred such decrees are not worth a groat. \" With respect to a judgment recovered against Mr. Goodwin, which they say we dare not review, we shall convince them sooner than they desire that they are under a mistake, and that all their endeavors to establish their claim will turn out like their expenses in settling, good for nothing. \"Thus we have made a short reply to Mr. Ford and company, and given a brief account of their title, which sufficiently shows that it is good for nothing. As to our own title, they acknowledge it to be a good one, though they are not disposed to allow that it extends to so much land as we think it does ; for theyr say we have no right to any lands below Cobbiseconte, nor above their falls of Negumkike ; but as we have proved the contrary in our reply to the Brunswick proprietors, we therefore refer those who want satisfaction in that point to said reply. \"Mr. Ford finishes his performance with this declaration, 'that the next time he makes any answer to the Plymouth Company or their clerk, it shall be in the manner he proceeded with Mr. Good win, their agent.' \"We are obliged to Mr. Ford that he will condescend to answer us in any manner, and he may be assured we shall always be ready to return his civilities in whatever manner he thinks proper to express them.1 Boston, May 29, 1754.\" Notwithstanding this spirited reply of the proprietors the Clark and Lake claim was in part fully established.

In the fall of 1754 the Province sloop was loaded with supplies for the eastern forts. She was first to go to St. George's and Pemaquid, and then to Cushnoc with stores for Fort Western and Fort Halifax. She had on board also some presents for the Penob scots and Norridgewock Indians ; when, on the 6th of November, an express arrived from Fort Halifax, informing the governor that the Indians had fallen upon a party of six of the garrison sent out to draw logs for the use of the fort, and had killed and scalped one man, and carried away four others as prisoners, one only escaping to the fort.1 This act of barbarity and treachery on the part of the Indians, together with the information that the French with the Indians were preparing to make an attack upon the forts, changed the aspect of affairs. The presents designed for the Indians were withheld ; the Province sloop was detained, and the council ordered an additional force of one hundred men and five \" Cohorn morters,\" which the House refused to vote, -upon information from the com missary general that there was not sufficient provisions and stores at the fort for the additional force, and that they could not then go by water to within fifty miles of the sort.2 The House, however, on the 21st of December appointed a committee to take into con sideration the state of Fort Halifax ; this committee recommending the captain general to appoint some suitable person to proceed to Fort Halifax with special authority to strengthen it and the redoubt on the hill, and to make them proof against small cannon, and to reinforce the garrison with forty effective men, and that tour hundred and sixty men should be detailed from the independ ent companies at the eastward, to be held in readiness to march instantly to the relief of the fort on the first advice of an attack or the approach of an enemy. Twenty double beds and forty single blankets were to be purchased and sent to the fort for the use of the forty men ordered for the reinforcement.3 The governor, in accordance with the recommendation of the House, under date January 3, 1755, informed Capt. Lithgow that Jedediah Preble had been commissioned commander of the fort, and he was directed, without waiting for him, to make provision for 1 18 Council Records, p. 207-314. :l Jour.

He was also informed that forty recruits were ordered, and that the Indian, Bartholemew, would act as pilot through the woods and in scouting.1 The new commander did not make his appearance, and the forty recruits numbered but nineteen when they arrived with the stores about the first of February. In the mean time the garrison was in a suffering condition, requiring the active efforts of its energetic commander for their relief, in pursuit of which he left the fort on the 4th of January, and arrived at Richmond fort on the 8th, where on the next day he addressed the following letter descriptive of their condition to the governor : \" May it please your Excellency, The soldiers of Fort Halifax are in a most deplorable condition for want of shoes, bedding, and bodily clothing, &c.

On the 22d of March he informed the governor that the barracks were so far done as to accommodate the soldiers, and that plank shutters had been made for the doors and windows ; that his family must be removed from Fort Richmond, though there was no suitable place for their accommodation, and asked what should be done in relation to completing the fort, for, he remarked, \" as it now stands it is one of the most extraordinary Fortresses for ordinaryness I have ever seen or heard of.\" He says that he was \" cutting timber for strengthening the garrison, one half of whom were unable during the winter to go abroad on account of the scurvey and other ails, and that he had 200 tons of hewn timber on the eminence, which could be used in any way his Excellency may please to order.\" He expressed his determination \"to erect another redoubt on the eminence, cannon proof, to be garrisoned with a sufficient number of men to defend it against a considerable army, with great artillery.\" If the fort should be erected on the hill, he thought the redoubt could be joined to it, and would make a good flanker. He said he had \" a hundred tuns of board logs and bolts to make shingles, most all hauled in on hand sleds.\"1 Neither the fort or garrison were disturbed during the winter by Indians ; but in the spring they shot one Barret at Ticonic, and a Mr. Weston was taken captive when passing from Fort Western to Fort Halifax. Capt. Lithgow having collected his materials was proceeding with the erection of the fort, an alteration in the plan of which he had submitted to Gov. Shirley, who laid it with Winslow's plan of the fort before the House, and the same were referred to a committee, which subsequently reported that in their opinion the plan drawn by Capt. Lithgow should be adopted. Winslow's plan is on file in the State House, Boston, and is as follows, with Winslow's letter to Gov. Shirley relating to it.s 1 4th vol.

Lithgow's plan, of which no copy was retained, was sent to Fort Halifax with instructions and was lost. From a recent thorough examination made of the remains of the foundations of the fort1 we are enabled to restore Lithgow's plan, and determine the alterations in Winslow's plan recommended by him and adopted by government. Winslow, when he left Fort Halifax, had constructed the central block house A, in which the cannon were mounted, also had com menced the small block houses for barracks, marked C, which Col. Lithgow completed. Ho had also erected eight hundred feet of pickets with which they were enclosed, and had erected a block house, or redoubt, on the hill, which was mentioned by Gov. Shirley in his speech to the House of Representatives.2 This was the fort which Col. Lithgow commended for its \" ordinaryness,\" \" and which he proposed to alter to a square fort. This he accom plished in this manner. The barracks, C, were placed in a line on the south side of the block house, A, making a building twenty feet by eighty, with four rooms, which, with a sufficient space for a gate way at the southeast corner, formed the east side of the fort. The south side was formed by a palisade from the south east corner to a block house erected by Lithgow, and now standing, at the southwest corner. A palisade and the west end of a build ing, forty feet by eighty, at the northwest corner, also erected by him, together with the north side of the building and gate way between the east end and the block house, A, formed the north and west sides, which completed the square fort according to Lith gow's plan, and which corresponds with the foundation as discov ered in the recent examination mentioned. Without the plan which the examiner furnishes, we should not have been able to determine the alterations made in Winslow's plan. The center of the fort by Winslow's plan became the northeast corner by Lithgow's plan and construction. 1 See an Inquiry into History of Fort Halifax by T. 0.

The'first story,\" he adds, \"is raised. This redoubt will command the eminence, also the falls and all the cleared land to the west of the falls.

It will be surrounded by open jjalisades at proper dis tance to prevent the enemy firing it;\" 3 and October 20, 1755, he wrote \"There are two redoubts to defend.\" 4 This, in connection with the declaration of Montresor, an English officer of engineers, who was at the fort in 1760, is decisive of the question. He said that the fort \" is square ; its defence a bad palisade [flanked] by two block houses, in which there are some guns mounted) but as the fort is entirely commanded by a rising ground behind it, they have been obliged to erect two other block houses, and to clear the woods for some distance around ;\" 6 and the suggestion which Mr. Paine makes, that a third block house was erected after Montre sor's visit is wanting in probability, as Quebec had fallen the autumn previous. Fort Western was unmolested during the winter, but Capt. Howard wrote the governor, March 5th, that an attack by the French and Indians was expected, and prays that some cannon may be sent him. He says, \"The number of men is small, and the ground in the vicinity of the fort is advantageous for a surprise. The supplies here, intended for Fort Halifax, will induce the enemy to attack us.

FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR IN 1755 TO THE INCORPORATION OF HALLOWELL IN 1771. The encroachments of the French and the mischiefs of the Indians were rapidly approaching to a state of war, which was formally declared, June 11, 1755, against all the Indians east of Piscataqua except those upon the Penobscot, some hope then remaining that they might be conciliated. Large inducements were offered to volunteer companies of recruits to engage in the war ; two hundred dollars were offered for every Indian scalp, and two hundred and fifty for each captive. To individuals one hun dred dollars were promised for a scalp and one hundred and ten dollars for a captive. Particular attention was paid to the defence of the eastern frontier ; companies of scouts were established along the sea coast from Saco to St. George's, who patroled from post to post ; and Forts Western and Halifax were garrisoned with eighty men, and well supplied with stores. The sorts between the Kennebec and St. George's were put in a state of defence, and the friendship of the Tarratin Indians was cul tivated. But in June an embarrassing affair occurred which aroused the hostility of these Indians. James Cargill of Newcastle, had a commission to raise a company of scouts, and had enlisted men from that neighborhood; they, on the 1st of July 1755, made an excur sion for the purpose of obtaining the government price for scalps. When near Owl's Head they discovered a party of Indian hunters, who were Tarratines. Without stopping to inquire whether they were friends or enemies they immediately shot twelve and took their scalps. The remainder saved themselves by flight. Not satisfied with this barbarous act, on their return they met Margaret Moxa, a friendly squaw, who had been at St. George's fort and was returning with her child. They fired upon and mortally wounded her. She held up her child, which she called \" Nit,\" requesting that it might be taken to Capt. Bradbury at the fort, but one of the company replied that \"every nit will make a louse,\" and"], [87, "1*56. TFar with France. 65 knocked it in the head before the eyes of its expiring mother. The fate of Margaret was deeply deplored by the garrison, who knew the value of her friendly messages. Cargill was appre hended and tried on a charge of murder, but after a confinement of two years was discharged.1 The Penobscots, now smarting under fresh injuries, no longer hesitated between the French and English, and war was declared against them November 5th, but the remainder of the season and the succeeding winter passed without operations on either side. In June, 1756, Great Britain declared war against France, and Gov. Shirley took measures to prosecute the war with vigor. Four expeditions were planned. One was of two thousand men to go up the Kennebec to destroy the settlements on the Chau diere and overawe Canada; but the treasury was empty, govern ment embarrassed, the country burdened and distressed, and general alarm prevailed. Under these circumstances the expedi tion resulted in little more than the ramble of a scouting party. At Fort Halifax, which was viewed by the enemy as a work of great effrontery, two of the garrison who were catching fish at the falls were fired upon and mortally wounded by four Indians. but the arrival of men from the sort prevented their being scalped.2 The settlements on St. George's river seem to have been marked by the Indians for destruction, but the settlers and garrisons wen so well prepared that they were unable to effect their object. In March, however, two men were killed and one scalped and left half dead. In September a schooner was burned and two others taken in St. George's river, and three men were killed and three others missing.3 The garrison at Fort Halifax were discontented on account of the hard service and asked to be discharged. Their commander said, \"at Fort George's there is but one fort to guard, while here. with eighty men, four posts are to be defended, ye main fort, store house, and two redoubts ; at other forts, and Fort George's, they mount guard only once in five nights, so that it is plain that twentj men are as sufficient for Fort George's or any other near the sea, as eighty are for Fort Halifax, which is situated nearly fifty miles from. inhabitants, and sixty-five miles from ye sea, while other forts an ' Eaton's Annals, p. 95 ; 2 Williamson, p. 315. 2 2 Williamson, p. 328.

Shirley was recalled in 1756, and in August of the next year his successor, Gov. Thomas Pownal, arrived. The confidence of the public in the management of the eastern garrisons which had been impaired was confirmed and strength ened by the lengthy investigation of the case of Capt. Jabez Bradbury, commander at St. George's Fort, and Lieut. Thomas Fletcher of the same fort, before the two houses of the Legisla ture. The charges against them were of trading clandestinely with the Indians in time of war, and giving them intelligence inconsistent with the duty of officers. Many witnesses were exam ined, among whom were Capt. Lithgow of Fort Halifax, and Capt. Howard of Fort Western, but the charges proved groundless and probably arose from \"the liberal censure they bestowed upon James Cargill's bloody affair with the Indians.\" Bradbury and Fletcher had previously resigned their stations at St. George's Fort, and Capt. John North was appointed to the command with Jqhn McKecknie for his Lieutenant. Cargill after his liberation and the receipt of \u00a3600 for the scalps obtained in his exploit charged Bradbury and Fletcher with the treasonable practices for which they were tried.2 The Indians in the spring of this year were lurking around the settlements and fortifications on the Kennebec. At Fort Halifax, in May, some hunters in the wood heard a great \"yelling of Indians\" and supposed their numbers to be considerable from the noise they made. Five of the hunters not returning it was sup posed they had been taken by the Indians, and Capt. Lithgow immediately dispatched a boat with an Ensign and nine men to notify the settlements. This boat on its return was attacked ten miles. below the fort by seventeen Indians, who first fired at twenty yards' distance and wounded two men, though not mortally. The officer and crew of the boat behaved very gallantly, and returned the fire of the enemy who were in full view. They killed one Indian early in the action who laid upon the field during the con test,-which continued very furious on the boat until she retreated to the opposite side of the river, where the men took shell i i behind rtrees, and so continued till the Indians retreated over a 1 Lithgow to Shirley, Oct. 20, 1755, Letters, vol. 5. p. 41. 2 Eaton's Annals, p. 105; 2 Williamson."], [89, "1758.

This is said to have filled England as well as this country with extravagant demonstrations of joy.2 . In August, Gov. Pownal being informed that a combined force of French and Indians meditated an attack on Fort St. George's and the destruction of the settlements in that vicinity, immediately collected such military force as was at his command and embark ing on board two vessels sailed for its relief. He was successful in seasonably placing his reinforcement in the fort. Within thirty hours after his departure to return, the fort, which was then com manded by Capt. John North, was assailed by four hundred French and Indians ; but so well prepared were the garrison that their enemies were unable to make the least impression, nor did the threats or information of their numbers communicated by a cap tive woman lest purposely to escape create any alarm. After killing about sixty cattle in the neighborhood they retired.3 The Indians now becoming weary of the war discontinued their depre dations. In 1759 formal possession was taken by government of the Penobscot and Fort Pownal built and garrisoned with one hundred men. The troops at Fort Halifax and Fort Western petitioned to be dismissed the service. They were loud in their complaints of government ; saying they had been enlisted and impressed for one year and this was the third and fourth of their detention. They were unable to obtain their discharge,4 and perceiving that the fort must be dismantled if they left they sacrificed private con siderations and remained in the service. 1 Capt. Lithgow to Gov.

The year 1759 is memorable for Gen. Wolfe's famous siege of Quebec. On the nights of the 12th and 13th of September he led his columns to the attack of the precipitous heights on which rested the fortification. A battle bloody and desperate ensued, resulting in a decisive victory to the English arms, and the capitu lation of the celebrated fortress followed on the 5th of October, when New France passed under the dominion of Great Britain. The Indians, abandoned by their French allies, wasted by war and dispirited, proposed peace, which was made with them in the year following. The conquest of Canada was completed and at the close of the war was confirmed to the English by treaty. The war ended the efforts of the Plymouth Company to settle their lands. A few grants, however, were made during its pro gress, probably with a view to the preservation of their rights, aud the decisions of the courts in relation to the effect of actual entries. October 17, 1754, N.

In 1757, three grants were made in Frankfort, and bonndaries were arranged with the Pejepscot Company in pursuance of which a grant of three hundred acres was made to Henry Gibbs and Bel cher Noyes, at Atkins' Bay> in consideration that Oliver Noyes was at considerable expense in bringing forward the settlement at Small Point as surveyed and plotted by James Scales, November 1st, 1742.

Fort Shirley was offered to government for the use of soldiers and stores. Capt.

Capt. William Lithgow was granted one-eighth of the above tract for \u00a344, 8s. lid. lawful money. Samuel Oldham was granted one hundred acres in Frankfort, on condition of setting up and burning one kiln of bricks in the plantation in one year. In 1758 an adjustment was made with the Clark and Lake pro prietors, and a sale was made of delinquent proprietors' shares, at which one-five hundred and sixtieth part of the patent sold for \u00a310, and a thirty-two hundred acre lot, number nineteen, east side, was granted to John Jones on settling conditions, and quite a number of grants were made to settlers at Frankfort. In 1759 but few grants were made. Joseph Berry, of George town, obtained five hundred and seventy -one acres, and William Lithgow four hundred and sixty-four acres reserved in his former grant. Dr. Gardiner had a grant at Sheepscot river. Alexander Campbell, in consideration of thirty years' residence, obtained one hundred acres at Long reach, and Shubal Hinkley three hun dred and seventeen acres at the same place. The war having practically ended with the reduction of Quebec, and confidence existing that a permanent peace was about to be established, public attention was turned to the settlement of the Kennebec. February 13, 1760, the plantation of Frankfort was incorporated by the name of Pownalborough, in compliment to Gov. Pownal, to whom the Plymouth proprietors granted lot num ber twenty, of five hundred and one acres in that town, and pre sented him with a plan of the town, which then included the present towns of Dresden, Wiscasset and Alna, also Swan Island. The act of incorporation was pushed through the Legislature in some haste, with the view of making it the shire town of the pro posed new county of Lincoln, a petition for which was then pend ing before the Legislature. The county of Lincoln was incorporated June 19, 1760, with"], [92, "70 Lincoln Co. Incorporated. \u2014 Grants Increase. 17GO. Pownalborough as its shire town. The county then embraced all the State east and north of a line from the ocean extending up \" New Meadows river to Stevens' carrying place at its head, thence to and upon Merrymeeting bay and the river Androscog gin, thirty miles, thence north on a true course to the utmost northern limits of the Province.\" The act took effect November lst, and Samuel Denny, William Lithgow, Aaron Hinkley and John North were appointed Judges of the Common Pleas for the county ; and William Cushing Judge of Probate ; Charles Cushing Sheriff; and Jonathan Bowman Register of Probate and of Deeds. From April 1st to 8th the Plymouth Company made thirty-two grants to settlers, mostly in Pownalborough, and on the 9th forty two grants in Pownalborough and on Parker's Island, and seven teen other grants in that region were made to settlers and proprie tors during the remainder of the year, one of which was of one hundred acres in Pownalborough to Elijah Phipps, on the sole condition that he should work at his trade \" of a Potter for three - 1 years. On the west side of the river, lot number twenty was granted to Sylvester Gardiner, number twenty-one to James Pitts, and number twenty-two to Benjamin Hallowell. These were thirty two hundred acre lots, being one mile on the river and extending five miles back. Dr. Gardiner's lot was immediately above Cobbossee stream, while the two lots of Pitts and Hallowell were in the town of Hallowell, as was also number twenty-three granted to Dr. Gardiner. At this time the company directed their lands above the great lots on each side of the river to be surveyed for settlement. Three tiers of lots on each side of the river with lots one mile in length, were to be laid out. In the first tiers fronting on the river the lots were to be fifty rods wide, in the second tiers one hundred and fifty rods wide, and in the third tiers seventy-five rods wide. Two of every three front lots with the corresponding two lots in the third tier were to be granted to \"good settlers\"' on the condition of performing settling duties. This gave five hundred acres out of every nine hundred to settlers. Under this direction the land was lotted from the south line of the present town of Chelsea east of the river and the south line of Augusta on the west to the north line of Vassalborough, by John Winslow, whose plan of the same bears date June 17th, 1761.

At the time Pownalborough was made the shire town of Lincoln county the proprietors had given assurance that they would fur nish a court house for the county. The judges of the courts having called their attention to the fact that no convenient place was provided for holding the courts, they voted, April 13, 1761, to build forthwith at their own charge a court house \" within the Parade of Fort Shirley,\" forty-five feet long, forty feet wide, and three stories high, and that one room in the second story, twenty by forty-five feet, should be fitted with boxes, benches and what soever was needful for a court room, and the easternmost block house was appropriated for a jail, and the easterly part of the barracks for a house for the jail-keeper.1 The house erected for this purpose is now a conspicuous dwelling on the bank of the river in Dresden, a short distance above Swan Island. During the year 1761 two \" ranging parties \" were sent out by government to secure more effectually the trade with the Indians once so lucrative, and to learn more of the regions in which they dwelt. One party of fifteen men was under James Howard of Cushnoc. He ascended the Kennebec to its source and went down the Chaudiere to its mouth.2 He probably was successful in the objects of his efforts, but an accident befel his son John by the way, the effects of which we shall see continued through life.

Few grants were made this year to settlers. The proprietors, in order to quiet settlers upon their land who were made uneasy by claimants under Indian deeds, by whom they were sued and harrassed into settlements, by means of which money was extorted from them, provided that deeds with general warranty might be given, and as the company could not by law give them, they conveyed to Dr. Sylvester Gardiner large tracts of land on Sheepscot river, and the west side of the Kennebec between the Chops, Stevens river and Merrymeeting bay, in order that he might convey the title with warranty, and appointed John McKecknie to deliver seisin and possession of the same to said Gardiner. The standing committee numbered six members of whom Dr. Gardiner was one, the five others, James Bowdoin, Thomas Han cock, James Pitts, Benjamin Hallowell and William Bowdoin, covenanted with Dr. Gardiner to indemnify and save him harmless from five-sixths of all losses and damages arising on account of his warranting the title of lands he should sell. The other sixth, Dr. Gardiner, as a member of the committee, was to take the risk of himself, and the proprietors voted to indemnify said committee and to subject all lands belonging to them to immediate sale, to pay all loss or damage arising to said committee on account of sales to be made by Dr. Gardiner.1 Dr. Gardiner gave his bond in the sum of \u00a320,000 to receive and pay to the use of the proprietors all moneys arising from the sales. The title of the company in some of the lands proved defective, which brought large claims against Dr. Gardiner's estate which his heirs were not able to adjust with the company till under litigation many years after.2 March 31, 1762, grants of one hundred acres each in Pownal borough were made to Jonathan Bowman, William Cushing and 1 2 vol.

His Excellency, Francis Bernard, obtained number twenty-one, Pownalborough, in consideration of his promoting and encouraging the eastern settlements. On the 10th of February 1763, a treaty of peace was signed at Paris, by which France renounced to England all Canada and all her other northern dominions in America. This was followed by the formation of Canada into a province by the name of Quebec. No event had transpired of so much importance and so favora ble to the interests of Maine as the reduction of Quebec and the removal of the French from Canada ; and in no part of the State was its influence more favorably felt than on the Kennebec. The Indian wars had now ceased, French aggression ended, titles to landed property were being investigated and local civil govern ment strengthened and sustained, business was reviving and population was increasing. The growing importance of the colonies induced the Lords of Trade, in 1764, to order a census of the inhabitants in order that they might know more fully their ability to bear taxation. This was the first step toward that system of measures under the influ ence of which the colonists revolted. By the census taken, the population of Maine was computed at 24,000, of which 4,347 were in the county of Lincoln, which were distributed as in the following table.1 Towns and Plantations. Whites.

The only settlements at that time were at Cobbos see, Cushnoc aud Fort Halifax. The settlement at Cobbossee or Gardinerstown was commenced in the fall of 1760, when eight per sons, four having families, came to, that place under the patronage of Dr. Gardiner, who early in the next year erected a grist mill and saw mill and a large mansion house, long known as the Great House.1 From this nucleus the settlement had grown probably to Some twenty families when the census was taken. At Cushnoc the settlement commenced with the erection of Fort Western in 1754, and at the end of ten years probably numbered over one hundred souls ; 2 while at Fort Halifax, the settlement of which commenced at the same time with Fort Western, the inhabitants numbered nearly as many. In the three settlements there could not have been less than three hundred persons. The Plymouth proprietors on the 19th of January, 1764, com menced their seventh meeting, which was continued by adjourn ments to July 12, 1775, during which Dr. Sylvester Gardiner was moderator. February 8th grants were made of large tracts of \"back land,\" delineated on John McKecknie's plan of November, 1762, to the following proprietors : to James Bowdoin a tract two miles by ten ; to Benjamin Hallowell three hundred and sixty rods by ten miles; to Edward Goodwin, for himself and others, two hundred and forty rods by ten miles ; to William Bowdoin four hundred and eighty rods by ten miles ; to David Jeffries and Gershom Flagg two hundred and sixty rods by ten miles ; to Charles W.

All these grants were \"in consideration of their great trouble and expense in bringing forward settlements on Kennebec River.\" This was also the consideration expressed in the grants made when the proprie tors divided their lands, and was without any special regard to services rendered.

The proprietors having caused an advertisement to be exten sively circulated in England, Ireland and America, that they pro posed laying out three townships to be granted to settlers upon performing settling duties, now directed six townships, six miles square, to be laid out on the west side of the Kennebec, commenc ing three miles and sixteen rods from the river, and four miles north of Cobbosseecontee, and running twelve miles to the west line of the patent, and eighteen miles north and south ; and that two hundred acres be granted to every family settling in said town ships upon condition of building a house twenty feet square, seven feet high, and making fit for tillage five acres of land in three years, and residing in person or by substitute on the same for seven years.

This was done in the hope that something might be made of the lands by proper management, though some of the proprietors \" declared that the tract was not worth the ex pense upon it, and this was in fact the case if the then value was only considered.\" One twenty-fourth part of the whole purchase was sold at \u00a3192 lawful money, and Tyng himself had sold in 1750 one twenty-fourth part for \u00a3133, 6s. 8d, at which time the lands were a great part in the possession of other persons, and a much greater part claimed by other companies ; the event of which claims and suits arising from them was uncertain, which occa sioned the lands to be thought of little value, but by exertion and expense the proprietors had made them of some value.1 Robert Smilh and John Cort of Boston were granted Neguam- 1 2 vol.

The conditions of this grant were complied with by Winslow and his associates. It was the only grant of fl township upon the condition of per forming settling duties which passed from the proprietors. Their success was probably owing in a measure to settlers already occu pying under preemption rights acquired by virtue of a general invitation in the advertisements of the company for settlers. In pursuance of the system of taxation which the mother coun try was about initiating in the colonies, Parliament, January 10th, 1765, passed the memorable Stamp Act, which aroused the colonies to action. Massachusetts by her General Court, in May, proposed a Congress of deputies from each colony to meet in the city of New York, which convened as proposed and declared the sole power of taxation to be in their own assemblies. The excitement was so great that the stamp officers declined their appointments, and the act was finally repealed March 18th, 1766. Parliament, however, in the next year imposed a duty to be paid by the colo nists on paper, glass, tea, &c. This being considered oppressive and unconstitutional, measures were taken to unite the colonies for redress. In opposition to this the General Court was dissolved by the colonial governor, and as he refused to issue precepts for a nesp legislature, a Provincial Convention assembled at Boston, September 22, 1768, at the instance of the selectmen of that town, at which more than one hundred towns were represented. The 25th of the same month the British troops arrived in Boston, and on the 5th of March, 1770, the Boston massacre occurred, while in April of the same year the duties were repealed on all articles except tea.

FROM THE SETTLEMENT AT CUSHNOC IN 1754 TO THE INCORPORATION OF HALLOWELL IN 1771. The first occupation of Augusta, under its ancient Indian name of Cushnoc, was by the Colonists of New Plymouth, who about the time they obtained their patent established a trading house 1 on the east side of the river near the location of Fort Western.2 In 1654, when government was instituted on the Kennebec by Thomas Prince, Lieut. Thomas Southworth resided at Cushnoc in charge of the trading house as agent of the colony, and was appointed by Prince \" assistant to the government,\" with \" such others as shall be sent there from time to time to have the gov ernment of that family.\" 3 Southworth had probably been some years in charge of the establishment, since we find him in 1648 a witness to a deed from the Indian chief Natahanada to Gov. William Bradford and others, of land on both sides of the Kennebec, from \" Cushenocke to Wesserunskik,\" 4 which he probably was instrumental in ob taining. Gov. Bradford was his father-in-law, having married Alice Southworth, his mother, for whom he had formed an attach ment in his younger days, before he came over to Plymouth, but was prevented from marrying her by her parents, who objected to him on account of his inferior standing. The governor having lost his wife in Cape Cod harbor in December, 1620, and Mrs. Southworth being a widow, he induced her, in 1622 or 1623, to come to Plymouth with hei^two sons, Thomas and Constance, and marry him.6 Thomas, after his residence at Cushnoc. became a 1 Ante, p. 4. 2 Heath's plan, p. 20. 3 Records of New Plymouth, p. 58.

Thomas Southworth, who, full of faith and comfort, expired at Plymouth December 8th, being about fifty three years old, after he had served God faithfully both in a public and private station.\" ' The post at Cushnoc was maintained by the colony and its lessees until about the year 1660, when the increasing Indian troubles, which finally ended in war, destroyed their lucrative traffic, and the patent passed into other hands. No attempt to settle at this place was made until near a century after. The remains of the post formerly occupied was still visible in 1692. 2 In 1732 a settlement was contemplated by Gov. Belcher, who, in his eastern tour that year, informed the Indians at St. George's river that one of the missionaries who were to be sent to them was to reside at Cushnoc, where a church and town was about to be built.3 But the settlement did not originate at so early a day, nor in the peaceful manner indicated by the governor. It was not until the erection of Fort Western by the Plymouth Company on their lands in 1754 that a settlement at Cushnoc was com menced. Fort Western was garrisoned at the public expense, and had its origin in those incipient measures of protection and defence which preceded the French and Indian war ; a war in which the French and English were struggling for dominion in America, and in which the French in this region were desirous and endeavoring to establish and extend their former undefined Acadian possessions, now under the claim that it was Canadian territory. As a dependence of Fort Halifax at Ticonic, Fort Western was made sufficiently strong to successfully resist any force which it was anticipated might appear before it. At the time it was erected not a settler is known to have dwelt above Fort Rich mond. The forest had scarcely been broken by the axe of civil ized man. The site where formerly stood the New Plymouth trailing house, which had been abandoned for nearly a hundred years, and time had probably removed every vestage of its re mains, was covered with a growth of wood which could only be 1 New England's JIemori.il, p. 345. 3 Eaton's Annals. 2 Deposition of Joseph Bane."], [102, "80 Policy of Erecting Forts. 1754. distinguished by the practiced eye from the older wood of the surrounding forest. On the river above, except at Fort Halifax, the wilderness was unbroken to the settlements on the Chaudiere, in Canada, and below the nearest points presenting signs of civi lized life were Frankfort and Fort Richmond The fort at Cushnoc was then no desirable residence, a frontier fortress on the borders of civilization, liable to, and in constant expectation of, the stealthy incursions of a savage foe ; yet men of culture and women of refinement for that day took up their abode there, and resting under the protection of its walls laid the foundation of a settlement which has continued unbroken. Fort Western was not molested during the war, but rumors that it would be assaulted by a combined force of French and Indians caused its garrison to be strengthened and the fort to be kept in constant readiness for defence. The expedition of Gov. Shirley to the Kennebec and the erec tion and maintenance of Forts Western and Halifax were very expensive to the Province, and had the appearance of being a waste of money, as no enemy appeared in force before the forts during the war. However, the policy of this expenditure, aside from protecting and fostering settlements, is fully supported in view of the threatening aspect of public affairs at the time. The English and French were about commencing a struggle in which it was anticipated their colonies in America would take a con spicuous part. The contest for dominion was coming ; the con summation of a French project to enlarge their territory in America, of fifty years' standing, was to be attempted. The seat of French power in this country was at Quebec, which was strongly fortified and made a base for military operations. With the Canadian and Maine Indians as allies, and the Kennebec and its tributary waters as a highway of communication, the French were systematically aggressive, and the settlements in Maine were, as they had been for a century, past, exposed to the sudden and secret incursions of their hereditary enemies with their merci less savage allies. The erection of the forts on this avenue it was thought would overawe the Indians and deter the French from an aggressive movement in this direction. Of so great importance was the measure considered by the home government that \"His Majesty's particular approbation of the zeal and rigor evinced\""], [103, "1759. Armed Boats. \u2014 After the War. 81 in the enterprise was communicated by the governor to the Gen eral Assembly.1 The erection of the forts is said by Hutchinson to have been the project of Gov. Shirley, \"yet,\" he remarks, \"as it had the appearance of originating in the Assembly there was no room for complaint.\" The first movement, however, for the erection pro bably came from the Plymouth Company in 1751, when they petitioned the General Court to remove Fort Richmond further up the river.3 When, afterwards, war with France appeared inevi table, Gov. Shirley with clear military foresight perceived the advantage the fortifications would give in the coming contest, and under the influence of the assembly, as well as the Plymouth pro prietors, gave his countenance and support to the enterprise which so decidedly elicited the approval of the home government. The difficulty of transporting supplies to Fort Halifax materially' added to the expense of maintaining the post. The road which the governor had caused to be made between the two sorts was useless in winter, on account of deep snows which filled the val leys it crossed. The river which furnished an easier means of transportation in summer was difficult to ascend. Eight boats of two tons each armed with four swivels, provided for the purpose of transportation, did not answer the expectations of Capt. Lith gow, and he sent to Falmouth for whale boats which were more serviceable.4 The winter after the erection of the forts, their supplies which were detained in the Province sloop were hauled on the ice on hand sleds from Merrymeeting bay, and two hundred barrels of provisions were transported in the same manner, with great labor, from Fort Western to Fort Halifax.5 Under such difficulties it is not surprising that by popular estimate \"every biscuit sent to Fort Halifax cost the Province a pistareen.\" 6 The war was practically ended in the fall of 1759, yet a treaty of peace was not signed until February, 1763. Fort Western con tinued to be garrisoned, but with a diminished force. This was thought necessary on account of the unsettled relations with the Indians. In January, 1764, Gov. Bernard recommended garrisons at forts Halifax and Western as large as at Fort Pownal, and in 1 Hutchinson's Hist. Mass. Bay, p. 307. 4 Lithgow's Letters to Shirley. * Ib. p. 26. 5 Lithgow to Gov.

Some of the gar rison were impressed into the service, and all were discontented with their long detention and scanty and long delayed pay. When, however, there was a prospect of an established peace they probably consented to settle in the neighborhood on the recently surveyed lands of the Plymouth Company, to which they were invited by the liberal terms offered to settlers. At this time the town of Pownalborough, which had just become the shire town of the new county of Lincoln, was the most im portant settlement on the Kennebec. Among its residents were three Harvard graduates of the class of 1755, Charles Cushing, Jonathan Bowman and the Rev. Jacob Bailey. The latter gentle man, after crossing the Atlantic to obtain Episcopal ordination, was sent by the \" Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts/' as missionary to that place, where he arrived July 1st, 1760, and resided for the first few months in the family of Samuel Goodwin,1 a Plymouth proprietor. The settlement at this time numbered about one hundred and fifty families, scattered along the banks of the river. They were destitute of religious or secular instruction, were very ignorant, and in geneal so poor that their families suffered for necessary food and clothing. They lived mostly in miserable huts, half of which were without chimneys ; many of their children were obliged to go barefoot through the winter, and were destitute of necessary clothing; many people were without other beds \"than a heap of straw;\" and whole families had scarcely anything to subsist upon for months except roasted potatoes.2 In this unpromising condi tion of the settlement Mr. Bailey held services in private houses and the chapel connected with Fort Richmond, until the court house was built, in 1761, when it was used for many years on Sundays. The missionary having married, removed \" for a dwelling,\" in the spring of 1761, to Fort Richmond, which was then \" an old dismantled fort\" on the opposite side of the river. Here he ' Frontier Missionary, p. 79. 2 Ib. p. 88."], [105, "1760.

Three quaker families and two families that were \" English church people\" were all the settlers, according to Mr. Bailey, who came to the Kennebec in 1760. The latter and one family of the former stopped at Cobbossee, and two families of the former at Pownalborough.1 In 1763 Mr. Bailey went to Cobbossee to lecture, and found, as he says, some of the people \"the greatest bigots in the laud against the church of England.\" They excused their attendance and desired he would visit them on a Sunday. However, he went to Capt. Howard's at Fort Western and preached, where he had \" a considerable congregation of the upper settlers.\" 2 Aster this he officiated frequently at Cobbossee, where he \"opened the church \" which was just built, August 16, 1772, with a congrega tion of eighty persons, and baptized eight individuals. He was invited to and visited Pondtown, preached a number of times at Fort Western, and extended his visits two or three times to Fort Halifax. But about this time he met with serious and annoying opposition from some of the officials connected with the courts at Pownalborough, who were descended from Puritan stock, and viewed with jealousy the introduction among them of the Episcopal form of worship. Having at this time erected, with the assistance of Dr. Gardiner, a church and parsonage, the title to the land on which they were built was questioned by those opposed to him and the church. This caused him a good deal of uneasiness and trouble. But he was soon involved in difficulties of a more serious nature arising from his adherence to king and Parliament at a time when the country was organizing in determined opposition to their arbi trary measures. He would pray for the king, and the people would mob him ; would not sign the non-consumption agreement, and would preach sermons which the whigs considered seditious; for which he was summoned before the committee of safety and inspection, and was arraigned under the transportation act. At length the cause of the king, which he had confidently believed would ultimately prevail, grew desperate, and the annoyance of the whigs had reduced him to such straightened circumstances as to compel him to seek shelter and support with the king's loyal 1 Frontier Missionary, p. 343. 2 Letter to Dr. Gardiner in F.

From this retreat he held correspondence with absentees and tories during the remain der of the war. The\u00bbPlymouth Company' , now that French dominion had ended and the power of the Indians was broken, commenced the settle ment of their lands at Cushnoc. John Winslow was employed to make a survey and plan of lots, with the intention of giving the larger part to actual settlers upon condition of performing light settling duties. He laid out lots in three ranges, on each side of the river, all a mile in length. Those next to the river in the first range were fifty rods wide and contained one hundred acres ; those in the second range were of the same width as three of the front lots, one hundred and fifty rods, and contained three hundred acres each; those in the third range were seventy-five rods wide and contaiued one hundred and fifty acres each. The proprietors re served to themselves every third front lot and the lots in the second range, and gave to the settlers the other front lots and the lots in the third range. ! The proprietors thus retained sour hundred and gave the set tlers five hundred of every nine hundred acres. Each settler was entitled to two lots containing two hundred and fifty acres of land, one hundred in the first and one hundred and fifty in the third range, on condition of building a house twenty feet square and seven feet high, and clearing five acres of land suitable for tillage within three years, and dwelling on the land eight years hy him self or his substitute. They were also required to work on the ministerial lot, or the house for the public worship of God, two days in a year for ten years, when requested by the standing com mittee of the proprietors. The valuable lands at Cushnoc, under these very liberal terms were rapidly taken up. The first grants were made April 28th, 1762, and within four years after all the settlers' lots were granted but five. These were probably occu pied by persons to whom they were subsequently granted. The following is a list of the original grants at Cushnoc made by the Plymouth Company, with the numbers conforming to Wins low's plan of survey, dated June 17, 1761, with the date of the grants and the residence of settlers and proprietors at the time they were made.

Grants on the West Side. James Howard, the military commander of Fort Western, may be considered the first settler at Cushnoc. He was a highly respectable gentleman, who came from the north of Ireland to Boston early in the last century, and associated himself with a number of his countrymen who like himself were of the Protestant religion aud of Scotch descent, for the purpose of settling in some approved place. Howard and six others were appointed a com mittee by their associates to examine various localities. Having visited the Kennebec, Pemaquid, and St. George's river, three attractive places of settlement in \"the eastern country,\" they were influenced by the superior advantages offered at St. George's, and the liberal terms proposed by Gen. Waldo, to enter into a contract with him to settle on his lands on that river. This was in April, 1735. The next year Howard with his family, consisting of his Namos of Settlers and ! Date of Grant.

Here his daughter Margaret was born October 25th, 1738, and his son Wil liam two years after. In 1745, during the war with France and Spain, many of the settlers having embarked in the expedition against Louisburg, the settlement was broken up, and Howard with his family probably repaired to Boston. However, upon the restoration of peace, in 1749, he returned and remained until 1754,1 when he accompanied Gov. Shirley in his expedition to the Kennebec, and was appointed commander of the garrison established at Fort Western. He was soon followed by his family. They resided at the sort during the war. With the exception of William Lithgow at Port Halifax, Howard was the first magistrate on the river above Pownalbor ough. He united many of the early settlers in marriage. For many years he was not only the most influential man in the settle ment, but the most prominent in this region of country. He was sent by government in 1761 on an expedition to Canada, with a party of fifteen men, to explore the intermediate country, ascertain the disposition of the Indians and endeavor to secure their trade.8 While on this expedition, John Howard, his son, who accompaninl him, fired on one occasion when in the woods at what he supposed to be a bear; it proved to be one of the party, and that he had un fortunately taken his life. No blame was imputed to Howard, but the occurrence so affected him that he sank into hopeless insanity. \" He lived long at the fort, gentle and inoffensive, but possessed of immense imaginary wealth.\" 3 James Howard, with his sons Samuel and William, engaged in business at the fort after the war, monopolizing the lucrative lum ber trade of the upper Kennebec, and running the only vessel at that time above Georgetown, which was commanded by Samuel. They were looked upon as fathers and benefactors of the new set tlement, and had the confidence of every one. Their will was law. An instance of their consequence is related. A rumor was afloat that a strange vessel was coming up the river to trade. This was regarded as interfering with the rights which the Howards had acquired by early and exclusive occupation, and the question was ' Eaton's Ann. 2 2 Williamson's History. 3 Judge Weston's Eeminiscenses in Kennebec Journal Oct. 23, 1851."], [112, "1762. 88 James Howard. \u2014 John Hoivard. earnestly asked, \"Will the Howards let them come?\"1 James Howard retired in a few years leaving the mercantile business to his sons. He obtained, in 1763, grants of lots number thirty-three and thirty-four, east side, at Riggs' Brook, upon settling conditions. On one he built the \"great house,\" and two years after was released from the condition of building another upon agreeing to attend to the business of the Plymouth Company, \"so far as concerns the business of his office as a Justice of the Peace, for two years, free of any fees.\"2 In 1769 he purchased the fort tract, containing nine hundred acres, with the fort buildings, for five hundred dollars, or \u00a31125, old tenor. Two years after he purchased twelve hun dred and eighty acres in the rear of the fort lot, on the fourth and fifth miles. Upon the incorporation of Hallowell, Howard was one of the first board of selectmen, and was chosen Treasurer, which office he filled for nine consecutive years. During the Revolution he was an ardent patriot, and as a magistrate was a member of the court of sessions which tried the tories for their hostility to \"American measures.\" In 1784 he was appointed one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas for Lincoln county, with McCobb and Lithgow. When Thomas Rice, a fourth judge, was added, a shrewd countryman remarked that there were a thousand judges on the bench, and attempted to make out this singular enigma by saying, \" Rice is one and the others are three noughts.\" 3 Judge Howard held this office until his death, which occurred very suddenly, after thirty-three years residence at the fort, May 14th, 1787, at the age of eighty-five years.4 His children by his first wife were John, Samuel, William, and Margaret married to Capt. James Patterson. In January, 1781, he married a second wife, Susanna Cony, widow of Lieut. Samuel Cony, who survived him and married William Brooks. By her he had two children, Isabella who died in childhood, and James who died at the age of twenty-four years. John Howard, the Judge's eldest son, was born in 1733. He is said to have been the most enterprising of his children, and was the second in command at Fort Western during the French war. In 1759 be was entrusted with dispatches from Gen. Amherst, which had been forwarded to Fort Western from Crown Point to 1 Daniel Sewall, Esq. 3 Red Book, Hist. Soc. Library. 2 Plymouth Co.

He delivered them with dispatch, performing a journey of nearly two hundred miles through a country which was at the time a wilderness. When accompanying his father on his expedition to Canada, two years after, he met with the unfortunate occurrence already noticed, which acting upon a mind of more than usual sensibility deprived him of his reason. He died at the fort July 30, 1804, aged seventy-one years ' Capt. Samuel Howard, the second son, was a master mariner, and was long engaged in business at the fort in connection with his brother William. Samuel purchased goods in Boston and Wil liam sold them at the fort and furnished freight for the vessel which Samuel run. For a few years before the Revolution he resided in Boston. In May, 1766, he married Sarah Lithgow, daughter of Col. William Lithgow of Fort Halifax, \"a woman of preeminent personal beauty.\" 2 Their children were two sons, William, who was a ship master, and Robert; and a daughter Sarah, who married Thomas Bowman. Capt. Howard died March 29th, 1799. Col. William Howard, brother of Capt. Samuel, was born in 1740. He was for a time a Lieutenant under Col. Lithgow at Fort Hali fax, when but nineteen years cf age. In 1759, Gov. Pownal when at Fort St. George's, on his expedition to the Penobscot, records the arrival of \"young Lieut. Howard from Capt. Lithgow of Fort Halifax.\" He may have accompanied the governor in the expedi tion, but probably was sent to report the condition of the upper forts and any indication which may have been discovered of the enemies' movements, and in response to an order directing the commanders of the forts to meet or report to Gov. Pownal at St. George's. Howard traded many years at Fort Western as resi dent partner of the firm of S. & W. Howard. He was the first representative from Hallowell in the General Court organized in 1775 under the revolutionary government. No representative had been previously sent from the town, and none was sent subse quently until 1785, when Joseph North was the first representa tive under the State constitution. He was occasionally a select man, and succeeded his father as treasurer in 1780, an office which he held for twenty-one consecutive years. He was lieutenant colonel in the militia in Revolutionary times, and was in Salton- 2 Daniel Sewall, Esq. 1 Kennebec Gazette, Oct. 4, 1804."], [114, "Margaret Howard. \u2014 Lieut.

Samuel Howard, by whom he had three sons, Samuel, James and John, and two daughters, Mary and Margaret. Samuel, known as Col. Samuel, became a gentle man of some note, and Mary married Rev. Dr. John S. J. Gardiner, rector of Trinity Church, Boston. The other children died in childhood. Col. Howard lived at the fort until his death, which occurred April 7th, 1810. His wife had previously died October 28th, 1785. Margaret Howard, daughter of Judge Howard, was married at the age of twenty-four years to Capt. James Patterson on the 8th of February, 1763. This was the first marriage at Cushnoc. The ceremony was performed by the bride's father, the only person authorized within a wide circuit of country. Patterson was the fourth son of Deacon David Patterson, who settled at St. George's in company with James Howard in 1735. He resided at Pownal borough, and was a master mariner. His son, Capt. Samuel Pat terson, resided many years in Augusta, and was the father of the Pattersons now residing here. Another son, James Howard Pat terson, married a daughter of Ebenezer Farwell of Vassalborough, and was the father of another branch of the Patterson family. Mrs. Patterson survived her husband and died March 21, 1806, at the age of sixty-seven years. Lieut. Samuel Howard was an elder brother of Judge Howard. He settled at St. George's river in 1736 ; removed when the set tlement was broken up during the French and Spanish war ; re turned after peace, and probably came to the Kennebec at the time Fort Halifax was erected. He was lieutenant at the fort under Capt. Lithgow,1 whose sister Margaret he married. He settled at Cushnoc after the war, on lot number one, west side, which was granted to him in 1768, and on which he lived until his death. His lot, number eighteen, at St. George's he conveyed to one Nelson July 19, 1776. During the Revolution he was two or three years on the committee of \"correspondence and inspection\" of the town of Hallowell, but at his advanced age he could not have taken a very active part in measures originating in the strug gle. He died April 22, 1785, aged eighty-four. His wife sur vived him, and died October 24, 1799, at the advanced age of 1 Mrs. Ereeman of Winslow, daughter of E.

Ezekiel Page came from Haverhill, Mass., to Cushnoc with his family in 1762. His son Ezekiel, then seventeen years of age, came with him. They settled on lots number nineteen and twenty-one, east side. According to the information of the son in 1829 at the advanced age of eighty-three, the population at Cush noc upon their arrival did not exceed thirty souls, including the residents at the fort, and the dwellings were seven log huts.2 Mr. Page probably came by land in the spring, perhaps before the snow had left, ascending the river on the ice. He drove a yoke of oxen all the way from Haverhill.3 He must have been here very early in the season or he would have found a larger number of set tlers. He stated that four of \\\\\\e log dwellings were within the present limits of Augusta, and three on the bank of the river opposite the city of Hallowell. One of the dwellings on the east side, in Augusta, was on the Arsenal lot and occupied by Moses and Seth Greely, father and son. The two on the west side were in Ward 4, on lots number twenty-two and number twenty -four, and were occupied by Adam Carson and Abishai Cowen. We are without information from Mr. Page as to who occupied the other dwellings. But Elias Taylor probably occupied an additional one on the west side, on his lot number twenty-one, of which he ob tained a grant April 28, 1762. when he was styled of Kennebec. His son Elias was born here, February 21, 1762, aud was the first white child born within the limits of Augusta. Taylor may have escaped the recollection of Mr. Page, from having removed from town many years before his narration. The other dwelling on the east side, within the limits of Augusta, was probably on lot num ber thirty-nine, forty-two, or forty-nine, it is difficult to determine satisfactorily which. Edward Savage came from Woolwich with his wife and. one child in 1702, and settled on number thirty-nine. He did not, however, obtain a grant of the lot until six years after.

In Chelsea, Jonathan Davenport may have prepared a dwelling in advance of the removal of his family. He came from Dorches ter with his wife and two children October 25, 1762, and settled on lot number eighteen, of which he obtained a grant in June fol lowing. James Cocks, who had a family, and was granted April 28, 1762, lot number seven, had probably erected his dwelling. He was at Gardiner early in that year, where Dr. McKecknie surveyed a five acre lot for him, and charged him \"for fronting\" his great lot, which was ascertaining the corners upon the river and marking the side lines a few rods back. We are unable to indicate the occupant of the other dwelling on the east side. On the west side, Deacon Pease Clark arrived in May, 1762, in the Province vessel, which came with supplies for Fort Western. He is regarded as the first settler in that part of Hallowell which retained the name after the incorporation of Augusta. No other settler on either side of the river, in that part of the town, is known to have so early record of his arrival. Ephraim Cowen of Dunstable, Mass., settled on lot number four, on which the State House now stands, in 1763. He served as a soldier during most of the French war, and was a shoemaker. For many years, in connection with other pursuits, he pushed the awl and waxed the thread of a cordwainer for the early settlers. He was one of a company of associates who purchased land on the Sandy river ; was the first clerk of the company ; and removed to the site of Farmington, with his son David B. Cowen, in 1788, where he remained until his death in 1797.1 Ephraim Butterfield, who was from Dunstable, settled on lot number three, adjoining Cowen's, at about the same time. He remained in town some years after the incorporation ; was engaged in lumbering and sawing lumber at Howard's mills, and finally removed with his son Ephriam to Farmington.2 Josiah French, who settled on lot number six, west side, built a house at the corner of Green and Grove streets, where he kept an Inn. He was the first Inn-holder on the west side of the river. 1 History of Farmington, p. 22 ; Howard's Account Book. 2 Ib."], [117, "r 1763.

He became a lieutenant, and was in the service a short time during the Revolution, near the close of which he removed to that part of Winthrop now Readfield, where some of his descendants now reside. John Gilley, one of the earliest settlers, was remarkable for his great longevity, having attained the extraordinary age of one hundred and twenty-four years. He was born in Ireland, at Castle Isles on the Bridgewater river, twelve miles from Cork, about the year 1690. Some years after his arrival in this country in 1755, he came to Fort Western and offered to enlist as a soldier. Capt. Howard, who was in command of the fort, declined at first to receive him on account of his age, remarking that he did not think he was able \"to bring a barrel of bread from the shore.\" He however was enlisted, and during his residence of a number of years with the garrison had occasional conversations with How ard, who came from Ireland, in relation to occurrences which had taken place in the old country. By \" comparing dates, ages, and various other circumstances,\" it was conceded that Gilley was seven or eight years older than Howard. He said he was a man grown and lived in Ireland in the winter of the hard frost, and that great mortality ensued the year following, and that he helped bury the dead in large numbers.1 Gilley married Dorcas Brawn, by whom he had a large family of children. When Dorcas was asked how old her husband was, she declared she did not know. \"When she first knew him he was called grandpapa Gilley.\" The late Dr. Benjamin Vaughan of Hallowell was interested to make an examination of Gilley, from which he became satisfied that his age was not over stated.2 He was active in body and mind, and after he was a hundred years old he held a breaking-up plough, \"and was smart as a trap and could jump like a fox.\" ne never was sick, and labored until his death,3 which occurred July 9, 1S13.

He found the lungs slightly adhering to the pleura, and the right lobe somewhat affected. The heart sound. The aorta at the curvature and at the valves near the heart a little ossi fied. The liver and other viscera of the abdomen sound and in a healthy state, gall bladder empty, stomach distended, but no very marked symptoms of disease.1 Gilley was below medium size, five feet three inches in stature. His greatest weight was one hundred and twenty-four pounds, but usually from eight to twelve pounds less. Being asked upon what he lived, by some one curious to know the influence of diet upon health, he replied, \"meat three times a day.\"2 Dorcas Gilley, his wife, survived him many years, reaching the advanced age of ninety-five in March, '1840, when she died, leaving numerous descendants. Daniel Hilton was a young man who came early to the fort, and probably remained some years with the garrison. He was long in the service of the Howards. He obtained a grant of lot number thirty, east side, in 1763, but soon relinquished it to David Thomes, whose wife's sister he married. He lived a long time in a small house which formerly stood near the fort, and died June 28, 1816, aged seventy-nine, leaving descendants. Capt. Daniel Savage was the son of James Savage of George town, who carried on a farm for Stephen Minot, in 1728, and pur chased of Edward Hutching in 1745 three hundred acres of land at Nequasset. The title to this land was in dispute by the owners of conflicting patents, and Thomas Stinson, through whom Savage's title came, obligated himself if he was \"disturbed or harrassed by law suits, that he would pay on exhibition of accounts all costs and expenses.\" 3 Capt. Savage, after the incorporation of Hallowell, became one of the principal inhabitants. He was a captain of the town, and commanded a company in the unfortunate expedition of Salton stall, in 1797, to Bagaduce.

Townsend, an early settler, was of Kennebec when lot number eighteen, west side, was granted him in 1764. He came from Massachusetts. ' His wife followed him. It is said she came with seven children all the way in a canoe, following the indenta tions of the coast, and that she and her sons propelled the fragile bark, in the management of which she was very expert.1 An intimate acquaintance with the hardy habits of the early settlers would make this traditionary adventure appear quite probable.2 The family occupied a log hut on the- front of their lot by the river, and after the erection of Howard's mills on the lot imme diately opposite on the east side, Townsend worked in them for some years. Daniel Townsend, his son, who was the father of Dodivah Townsend and the grandfather of Reuel Townsend, died of camp fever in the army before Ticonderoga, in 1777. James Bacon, phygician, on lot number thirty-three, removed to Sidney before the incorporation, algo his brother Ebon Bacon who obtained the adjoining lot removed to Waterville, and William Bacon, who was on number forty-three, east side, removed to Winslow. The rapids in the Kennebec opposite these lotg are called \" Bacon'g rips \" from these settlers. William Brooks, who obtained lot number twelve, west side, early removed to Waterville.

At the organization of Lincoln county in 1760 he was appointed Register of Deeds, and in 1762 obtained a grant of lot number ten, west side, at Fort Western, which he probably occupied by a substitute, as it was a settler's lot. He was an ardent whig, early espoused the American cause, and was very annoying to his tory classmate the Rev. Jacob Bailey who was missionary at Pownal borough.

They were obliged to sleep the first night under the body of a cart turned bottom upwardg, which they brought with them. On the next day they congtructed a camp of boughs near the spot where the cotton factory now stands.

This stood at the corner of Central and Main streets, on the spot where Mark Means' bakehouse now staudg. In this he kept for some years the first house of entertainment, and was succeeded by a Mr. Randal, and afterwards by Nathaniel Tilton.2 Isaac was the father of William Clark, a lawyer of Hallowell, noted for his astuteness.

The new town came into existence on the eve of our revolution ary struggle, a period unfavorable for improvement and growth. For many years the inhabitants wrestled manfully with adverse circumstances, making little or no progress. They still lived in their log houses, mills were just erected, and no road existed with the exception of Shirley's military road, which probably had been kept open for a short digtance above the fort. The gettlement was on the east gide of the river at the fort, which was the only place of business and of gathering, except the mills on the Ellis brook which gave employment to a few laborers. On the west side of the river, where now is Water street, the land was covered with a growth of white birch, pines and saplings, without road or dwellings.

The names of the county officers and number of votes thrown are not recorded. The inhabitants assembled again at the fort July 1st of the same year, and adopted a primitive mode of establishing the roads ; this was by voting \"to have the town roads from the lower end of the town on the east side of the river to Fort Western ; also a road up and down on the west side ag the town rung.\" This vote doubtlegs provided for a road on the eagt side of the river from the south line of the town to the fort, above which Shirley's road made its further extension unnecessary, and a road the entire length of the town on the west side.

Aga Emmerson was a cooper ; made the barrels in which fish were packed ; purchased the north half of lot number seven, on the south side of Winthrop street, and built a houge at the foot of Court street, which, together with the lot, he sold to Capt. Nathan Weston the year he came to town. Emmerson afterwards removed to Winslow. He was taxed with money at interegt the year before his removal, probably the proceeds of his lot. How ever, he became poor, and was confined in jail for debt in 180T, when, with others, he addressed Lithgow the sheriff a poetical epistle, on Thankggiving day, which ig noticed at a subsequent date. Briggs Hallowell was a brother of Robert Hallowell aud nephew of Charles Vaughan. He appears to have had the care of land on the Kennebec, probably belonging to his father Benjamin Hal lowell, as early as 1768. In that year he gave Daniel Savage permission to get \" a fish sien on the banks of the lott adjoining to the lott where Thomag Lownon liveg on.\" The permit is dated \" Kennebec River, April 16, 1768.\" He was at Hallowell at the date of the incorporation of the town, and lived in a houge near Sheppard's point. His widow, Eunice Hallowell, kept a house of entertainment near where the cotton factory now stands. On the 4th of July, 1788, a number of gentlemen assembled at her house to celebrate the great event of the ratification of the Federal Con stitution by nine States. Hallowell is represented to have been a humoroug man, given to practical jokes. John Jones at the age of twenty-eight came from Concord, Mass., to the Kennebec, in the employment of the Plymouth Company as a surveyor of lands. He first surveyed a part of Pondtown and Hallowell, of which he made a plan, April 7, 1771. In the year following he gurveyed and made a plan of lotg \" east ward of Sheepscot river,\" and in 1773, we find him surveying and plotting lots in Canaan. In the spring of 1774, he made his plang of surveys in Vasgalborough, embracing Sidney ; also \"Twelve Mile pond,\" now Unity ; and Joneg' plantation, now China.1 He became pogsessed of Jonathan Bowman's lot, number ten, in 'Plymouth Co.

When parties were forming in relation to the parliamentary measures which induced the revolution, Jone3 adhered to govern ment and became a tory, and in consequence wag adjudged in a town meeting in Hallowell \" inimical to the liberties and privilegeg of the States,\" for which he was prosecuted. But during a delay of the proceedings the act under which they were ingtituted ex pired by limitation, and he thus escaped conviction. After this he wag arregted and confined in jail at Boston. However, by some means he escaped from prison and found his way .to Lake Champlain, and from thence, after several removes, to Quebec, where he arrived August 29, 1779. There he met Col. Rogers who was in the British service, and was appointed a captain in his regiment. He then went to the Pcnobgcot and was quartered at Fort George, at Cagtine. From that place he made geveral forayg to the Kennebec, in one of which he captured Gen. Charleg Cushing of Pownalborough, and took him en dishabille to the enemy. In another he cut out a schooner and took her safely to the Penobgcot,2 and by various predatory incursions, in command of \"Jones' Rangers,\"3 conducted against his former neighbors and acquaintanceg, he became very obnoxioug. Jones was reso lute, possessed of some ability as a partisan, and considerable cunning. He was small of stature, compactly built, and had a swarthy complexion of so deep a hue ag to be called \"Black Jones.\" In April, 1784, he was at St. Andrews with his wife attempting to obtain a grant of Grand Menan Island from the English government.'1 He soon after came privately to Hallowell, and was secreted by Amos Pollard in his tavern. The people in the neighborhood learning of this assembled, under the lead of Capt. Nathaniel Hearsy, and filled the house with \"infuriated men,\" but so effectual wag the concealment that he was not dis covered. After this Jones openly returned under the protection of the treaty of peace,5 and lived in a house which he erected near the lower factory boarding-house, where he died August 16, 1823, at the advanced age of eighty years. John Jones married Ruth Lee of Concord, sigter of Judge Lee 1 Howard's Account Rook. \"Frontier Missionary. 3 Judge Weston's Rem. * Frontier Missionary. 1 Judge Weston's Rem."], [136, "Mrs. Jones. \u2014 Gentlemen's Dress. 1772. 112 of Wiscasset, and John Lee, who was an absentee. Mrs. Jones was tall, of good appearance, well educated for the times, and was much egteemed by her intimate friends. It was, however, a congtant wonder of the women \"how she could marry Black Jones.\" She had no children, and living many years became sengitive about her age, which no one knew and many were curious to learn; but she guccegsfully foiled every attempt to ascertain it. Judge Cony, who possesged much humor under a cloak of grave and dignified exterior, once attempted to surprise her into parting with her secret by suddenly asking \" How old are you, madam ?\" She drew up her tall form with an air of offended dignity, raiged her half-closed hand towards the Judge, extending her little finger, and replied quickly, \"Just as old, Judge Cony, as my little finger.\"1 She died October 7, 1835, aged probably about ninety, although her age is given in the Ken nebec Journal as eighty-four. A disposition was generally prevalent at this time to dispense with the use of British goods, owing to the duty which wag imposed upon imports by Parliament, and non consumption agree ments were formed. Domestic manufactures were encouraged. Cups and gaucers, plates and other dighes were made of wood. Men in ordinary walkg of life, wore in the summer looge trousers made of tow cloth, and in winter small clothes made of deer or moose gkin. The dregg of a gentleman wag formal and precise. The head was covered with a napless beaver hat, with a two feet brim drawn up on three sides, presenting three angleg, and was so worn that two of the angleg pointed over the shoulders, and the third over the face, the latter forming a convenient handle by which the hat was raised in ceremonious salutation. The head, under the hat, was covered with a wig varied from the \"club or tie wig \" to full flowing curls resting upon the ghoulders. The coat had a stiff, upright collar, was straight in front, broad in the back, padded over the thighs, and ornamented with lace of gold or silver. The waistcoat wag single breasted, without a collar, skirts rounded and degcended to cover the hips. Small clotheg descended to, and were buttoned and buckled at the knee.

A finer cloth was woven in checks of various colors for female wear. Another kind for sheets and table linen went through a process of bleaching. This kind of cloth entered largely into consumption, also a kind formed by combining flax with wool. In some parts of the country \" gpinning beeg and wool-breakings \" were held for spin ning and carding. They were social gatherings, which not un frequently ended .with a danoe.2 The annual town meeting for 1773 was held on the 15th of March, at the houge of \"Josiah French, inn-holder.\" The houge wag on the west side of the river, on lot number six, near the Methodist meeting-house on Green street. The meeting having elected some town officers, including two constableg, one of whom was John Jones, adjourned to the next day, to the houge of Ezekiel Page, on lot number twenty-one on the east side of the river. At Page's house the vote choosing constables was reconsidered with a view of disposing of Jones, whose sympathy with the provincial authoritieg was more than suspected.

Mr. Murray extended his vigit to Fort Halifax, where, July 3. 1773, he baptiged three of Dr. John McKecknie's children.2 The first saw-mill within the limits of Hallowell was built about 1769, by James Howard, on the stream now called the Ellis or Riggs brook on the eastern side of the river. It was on lot num ber thirty-four, and was near the river. Samuel and William Howard a year or two after erected another mill on the same stream.

The sloop \"Two Brothers\" was added, in 1773, to the shipping of the place by the Howards, who had extended their business so as to enter upon their ledger the names of most of the settlers up and down the river, who purchased goods of them or made ship ments by their vessels. Their little fleet was kept busy. While the Phenix performed her allotted \"trips,\" the Industry and the Two Brothers went on \"voyages\" to Newfoundland and the West Indies, and the products of the place which they failed to carry were taken by \" Col.

A moderator was chosen, and adjournment had, to meet forthwith at Fort Western, when it was voted to \"join with Vassalborough in hiring the Rev.

It appears from the town \" rate list \" of this year that twenty six taxable persons were added to the population.1 The March meeting for 1774, was held at Fort Western, where town meetingg continued to be held with an occagional omission until the meeting-house was erected.

He instructed the colonel's sons, William and Samuel, and continued to preach for the town until a meeting held October 31, 1775, voted not to employ him longer \" by way of town rate.\" This was doubtless on account of the increasing troubles of the time which deprived the town of the ability or disposition to pay him. Indeed the town was largely indebted to him when he left, and he had not fully paid Col. Howard for hig board and some clothing. He is credited on the treasurer's book, under date of August, 1773, probably the time he commenced, \" with preaching fifty-two Sab baths, at twenty-four shillings, amounting to \u00a362 8s.,\" and in the following June is charged with \u00a327 4s., paid by the town. In 1785 the account was unadjusted, at which time Mr. Allen had deceased leaving his son John executor of his will. John wrote a letter to the town from Portsmouth, N.

Thig tardy act of partial justice would seem to be without excuse, but when it is recollected that during the ten years delay, the struggle of the Revolution involved the country in embarrassment and distress, and that in its great pros tration the town was unable to procure even the few articleg of clothing asgessed for the Continental army, it is not surprising that a debt, small as it was, the payment of which would give no immediate relief, should not have commanded attention, especially when the larger part was to be paid to its own citizens, as it was in this case, to the Howards.

From the non consumption in this country of tea it accumulated in 1773, in England, and was sent to Boston by the cargo A duty of three pence a pound caused strong opposition to its being landed. On the sixteenth of December of that year, the town of Boston held a meeting to deliberate in relation to the course which should be pursued with a recently arrived cargo. The meeting held to late into the night, and was unable to come to a con clusion, when the difficulty was settled by seventeen men who appeared on board the vessel, disguised as Indians, and dis charged her cargo of three hundred and forty-two chests into the water. This provoked the English government to adopt thoge arbitrary measureg which, in this year, were arousing the people and hastening on the revolution. The port of Boston was closed ; the Provincial charter altered ; the General Court adjourned to Salem, where five deputies were chosen to a Continental Congress: to convene at Philadelphia ; conventions were held in all the large towns which concurrently resolved not to acknowledge the RoyaS Council, and recommended delegates to be chosen to a Provincial Congress, which assembled at Salem, October 7th, and having organized, adjourned to Concord, where a Receiver General was chosen, to whom all taxes and public moneys were to be paid, and a committee of safety was appointed and invested with power to array the military for the common defence ; also a committee of supplies, who were to secure the public stores not seized by the governor. Having held three seggiong, this patriotic body dis solved December 10th. The plantation of Gardinerstown was represented in this Provincial Congress by Joseph North, who then resided at that place ; Vassalborough by Remington Hobby, and Winthrop by Ichabod How. Hallowell was not represented from some cause, probably through tory influence which may have paralyzed action. However, at the first call under the charter, a representative was sent, and the town was unfaltering in support of the new govern ment. The public indignation was very strong at thig time against those who upheld the authority of the English government and opposed the \"the American measures.\" Among the most promi nent on the Kennebec was the Rev. Jacob Bailey of Pownal borough, who, while on a journey to Boston in September, was \" insulted and mobbed,\" and on his return, when the court was in session, that place was invaded by a hundred armed men, who"], [143, "1774.

They are daily persecuted with provoking insult, loaded with shocking execration, and alarmed by the mogt bloody menaceg, and that, not by the meaner rabble, but by pergons of the highegt dis tinction, and thoge who heretofore have been in the greatest repute for moderation, piety and tendernegg.\" He remarks, \"that the friends of government are chiefly either Episcopalians, or sober, sensible persons of other denominations, who are equally averse to infidelity and enthusiasm;\" and adds, \"If the sons of liberty should prevail our destruction will be inevitable.\" The shutting of the port of Boston, and the \"violence of this raging faction,\" had brought Mr. Bailey into great distress, and it was with the \" utmost difficulty \" that he was \" able to procure the necessaries of life.\" ' When in October 1774, Mr. Bailey in journeying home from the West arrived at Falmouth, the country was in such a violent commotion that his friends advised him not to lodge at a public house. The next day Col. Cushing in returning home was surrounded by twenty-five men in arms, in \"the middle of the woods.\" They called him \" a tory,\" and demanded a sur render of a commission which they supposed he had obtained during his absence from the Colonial Governor. He assured them that he had taken none under the present government, when he was suffered to proceed. The next day Mr. Bailey was stopped at Stone's, in Brunswick, accused of being a tory and an enemy to his country, and urged to sign the solemn league. Upon his refusal he was notified that he would be visited the following week. Arriving at Pownalborough, he found the people in great consternation. A \"furious mob\" at Georgetown was searching for tea and compelling people by force of arms to sign the solemn league. Another was raging up the river within twelve miles. They had already destroyed one hundred and fifty pounds of tea 1 Frontier Missionary, p. 106, 107."], [144, "1774. John Jones Punished. \u2014 First Revolutionary Act. 120 for \"Esq.

Mr. William Gardiner had fled from their fury and tarried with Mr. Bailey all night, during which he expected every moment to be attacked, \" as the whigs had been invited among them and threat ened the utmost vengeance upon him and others.\" This was on a Sunday, it appears, as \"Mr. Gardiner returned after service,\" but was obliged to fly that evening, and escaped to Boston. About midnight one hundred and fifty men armed with guns and other weapons surrounded his house, demanded sight of him, and in sisted upon gearching for tea. At length they broke into and rifled the house, opened his desk and perused his papers, then inquired for John Joneg, the gurveyor, whom they found, and insisted he should sign the covenant, when he stripped open his bosom and told them they might stab him to the heart, but nothing should induce him to sign that \"accursed instrument.\" They then seized and threw him into the river, and dragged him about, till he was \" almost torn to pieces,\" but all to no purpose.1 The town of Hallowell when called upon by the Provincial Con gress to organize in defence of the country, promptly responded by the selectmen issuing a warrant for a meeting of the inhabi tants to take measures to place the town in a \"posture of defence.\" This was the first act in response to the revolutionary govern ment. The warrants heretofore had been in the name of \"His Majesty ;\" now the one calling the meeting was brief, and in the following words : \"Hallowell, January ye 11th, 1775.

Tory influence, which was somewhat developed at subsequent meetings, may have made the town officers cautious in their movements, and not over careful in preserving the minutes from which the records were to be made. Military titles soon appeared upon the records of the town, and it is not difficult to designate who were the rnilitary leaders. The captains were William Howard, Daniel Savage and James Cocks ; the lieutenants, Samuel Howard, David Thomas and Josiah French ; and others were doubtless substituted or added at a later day. At the annual meeting this year, John Jones, who had in his toryism some sympathizers, was chosen constable, when the town immediately \"reconsidered the constable vote,\" and \"purged the meeting,\" but with no better result, for they \" chose John Jones again.\" Jones' position, however, was an uncomfortable one, and the town, at a meeting held in the following month, voted to \" accept Jonas Clark for constable in room of John Jones, as he has hired him to serve in his room.\" At the same meeting Jones appeared again in uncomfortable political company. The meeting was desirous of sending a delegate to a revolutionary convention to be held at Falmouth, now Portland, and cautiously adopted the novel expedient of voting to \"choose' a committee of five, and for one of them to go to Falmouth, and for the man that goes to Falmouth to be paid by the town.\" This committee consisted of James Howard, James Cocks, John Jones, William Howard and Pease Clark. \" \u00a312 were raised to defray the expense of the committee and other necessary uses.\" The selectmen were in structed to provide \" a town stock as the law directs.\" Committees of correspondence, which were early chosen by towns in Massachusetts to organize measures of defence and com municate information of any design against the natural and con stitutional rights of the people,1 were now appointed in Maine. Under the exciting news of the battle of Lexington, which was arousing the people to arms, these committees upon the Kennebec were taking action. James Howard, on the 1st day of May, was appointed by the town \" a delegate to Pownalborough to meet the committees of correspondence of several neighboring towns, in order to act in behalf of this town, and in order to get provision and ammunition.\" He had unlimited authority \"to act on any 1 Lincoln's History of Worcester, p. 76."], [146, "1775.

Samuel Howard, Ezekiel Page and Lieut. David Thomas, who were called \"a committee to inspect any disorders, die.\" The news of the battle of Lexington, which was called \" Col. Percy's defeat,\" created great excitement in the country. At Pownalborough, on the day the intelligence was received, Mr. Bailey, the missionary, was \"abroad, and was assaulted by a number of ruffians.\" Two days after his brother-in-law, Rev. Mr. Weeks, rector of an Episcopal church in Marblehead, Mass., who had been driven from his parish by the patriots, arrived with his family. The people learning of his arrival, assembled by sunrise the next morning to prevent him from landing his goods. The committees of correspondence of several towns, which were to assemble at Pownalborough on that day, arrived in the midst of the bustle and confusion which arose and assumed jurisdiction of the case. After examining Mr. Weeks they gave him a permit to land his goods upon his signing what Mr. Bailey was pleased to call an \"ignominious paper.\" Ichabod Goodwin, a deputy sheriff and jailor at that place, and an intimate friend of the patriots Bowman and Cushing, was active in arousing the people in defence of liberty. He engaged the young men to assemble on new year's day to raise a liberty pole. At the erection some \"twenty refused to attend,\" scenes of hilarity followed, and Mr. Bailey has it that \"the confusion and uproar which ensued was beyond example.\" It was proposed that the parson should be conducted by a military escort to consecrate what he called the \" exalted monument of freedom,\" but this being submitted to a vote he was excused by a small majority. Immediately after one-half of the congregation of the church at Pownalborough withdrew, and the minister was \"stigmatized as a mortal enemy to his country \" for neglecting to observe a thanksgiving appointed by the Provincial Congress.1 At a town meeting May 29th, it was voted to hire the \" Rev. Thurston Whiting two Sabbaths this summer and fall.\" He offi ciated, and was paid \u00a31 4s. as appears by the treasurer's book.

The second Provincial Congress convened February 1, 1775, and held four sessions, when it dissolved May 29th. This was followed by the third and last Congress, which assembled at Watertown May 31st and continued to July 19th, a month after the battle of Bunker Hill. The Provincial Congress was in con stant communication with the Continental Congress, and requested to know of them what form of government they should adopt. A resumption of the charter was recommended and adopted, and precepts were issued for the election of members of a General Court to assemble at Watertown July 19th. The town of Hal lowell, on the 10th of July, at Fort Western, elected Capt. Wil liam Howard to represent them in the General Court. He was the first representative sent from the town. Under the government of the Provincial Congress the com mittees of correspondence and inspection exercised in some sec tions arbitrary, revolutionary power, acknowledging no superiors except the State and Confederate Congress,1 and the functions of civil government had so far ceased that the judicial courts were closed for sixteen months. Upon the assembling of the General Court the usual form of government was adopted, and the Council was acknowledged the supreme executive of the Province, new civil officers appointed, the militia enrolled and organized, laws passed, and paper money emitted, all in the name of the \" State of Massachusetts Bay.\" The General Court ordered \u00a3100,000 paper money to be issued to increase the army and create a navy. The Continental Congress directed bills of credit to be issued on the faith of the United Colonies, to the amount of three millions of Spanish milled dollarg to defray the expengeg of the war. Civil government wag now fully ingtituted in the State and Con federacy. Before the cloge of the year the Continental Congress established \"a General Post Office,\" which was put in operation from Georgia to Maine. The mails, however, were not conveyed eastward of Falmouth, now Portland. The inhabitants on the Kennebec in summer received their letters and news by vessels which arrived in the river from Boston aud other ports. During the exciting scenes of the Revolution these arrivals were looked 1 History of Worcester, p. 112."], [148, "1775. Arnold's Expedition. 124 for with absorbing interest. In the \"long and dreary winter \" they were in a measure isolated from information of the' stirring events transpiring in the country. The inhabitants, however, in the neighborhood of Fort Western at that season for several years were furnished with a mail from Falmouth by Ezekiel and Amos .Page, who alternately brought it once a month on snow shoes through the woods.1 From the rate list of a Provincial tax this year fifteen new names appear,1 among them Capt. Samuel Howard is noted as \" a late resident of the town of Boston.\" In the fall of this year, when Arnold ascended the Kennebec on his celebrated expedition to Quebec, the settlers must have been favorably impressed with the power and resources as well as the enterprise and energy of the new government. The troops for the enterprise, numbering eleven hundred, assembled at Newburyport, and embarking in eleven transports sailed on September 19 for Fort Western on the Kennebec. The next morning the expedition arrived in the river, with the exception of some transports which had been separated during a gale the preceding night. The fleet without waiting their arrival ascended the river to Gardinerstown, where the bateaux for the expedition were being constructed by Maj. Colburn, and remained until the 22d, when they were joined by the missing vessels. The Broad Bay, a topsail schooner, in which came Col. Arnold the commander, Rev. Samuel Spring the chaplain, Dr. Isaac Senter the surgeon, \"and a number of other gentlemen, several of whom were volunteers of distinction,\" now \"weighed anchor and proceeded up to Fort Western, leaving a number of men to bring up the bateaux.\" The wind being un favorable the Broad Bay was unable to reach Fort Western that evening. The next morning Dr. Senter left the vessel and pro ceeded five miles by land to the fort. He found \" most of the way was destitute of any road.\" Arnold had preceded him on the 21st, and established his headquarters at James Howard's, at the \"Great House,\" where he remained till the 29th.

Meigs during his stay there lodged on the night of the 22d at the house of Joseph North, who then lived in the olj Post Office building now at the head of Gay's wharf. Some of the soldiers were quartered at the house of Daniel Savage, below the Great House, on the \"cut road,\" when one of them by the name of James McCormick, on the night of the 23d. being turned out of the house in a quarrel discharged his gun into it and killed Reuben Bishop, a resident of North Yarmouth. McCormick was tried by a court martial and condemned to be hung. But Arnold sent him by the Broad Bay to Gen. Washing tun, with the representation that he \"appears to be very simple and ignorant,\" and \"had the character of being a peaceable fellow,\" to which he added a wish that \"he may be found a proper object of mercy.\"1 Bishop was buried just outside of the fort burying ground, near the east end of Kennebec bridge ; his remains were exhumed and interred in that ground when Willow street, which passed over his grave, was made.2 The commanding officer of the expedition, Col. Benedict Arnold, was \"a short, handsome man, of a florid complexion, stoutly made, complaisant and possessed of great powers of persuasion, but sordidly avaricious.\" One of the field officers, Lieut. Col.

J., and was killed by horsemen's sabres, near Hudson river, May 22, 1781. The other field officers were Lieut. Col. Roger Enos, who was second in command, Maj. Return J. Meigs, and Maj. Timothy Bigelow. Capt. Daniel Morgan of Virginia, a name celebrated during the Revolution, commanded the riflemen.

Vice President of the United States, was a volunteer, as was also John Joseph Henry, a youth of seventeen, who was afterwards Judge of a State Court in Pennsylvania.1 On the 24th, an exploring party under Lieut. Steele was sent forward in two birch canoes, with Nehemiah Getchell and John Horn of Vassalborough for guides. They ascended to the height of land between Maine and Canada, spotting the way across the carrying places through the woods, and having seen the great Chaudiere lake from the top of a tall tree, which they judged to be ten or fifteen miles distant, returned, and after much suffering and hardship met the advance party about the middle of October. The army at Fort Western was formed into three divisions in order to expedite the march and facilitate the transportation of provisions. Capt. Morgan's company, with pioneers, was in advance in the first division. Col. Green led the second, and Col. Enos, accompanied by Capt. Colburn's carpenters, brought up the rear. The advance cut the roads, built the bough huts, and made the river passable for boats for themselves and the divisions which followed. The provisions were distributed according to the sup posed difficulties to be overcome by each division. Many of the first companies took only two or three barrels of flour and several barrels of bread, while the companies in the last division took not less than fourteen of flour and ten of bread.2 The evening of the 25th Capt. Morgan left Fort Western and marched up the east side of the river with a division of riflemen. He was followed by a detachment of the army daily for the four succeeding days. The bateaux, numbering about one hundred, were each manned with five picked men. In these all the pro visions, tents and camp equipage were put, except what was neces sary for the detachment of six hundred men which went by land. Dr. Senter, the surgeon, left Fort Western on the 26th by land in company with Col. Green, Aaron Burr, and several other gen tlemen, and arrived at Fort Halifax the next day in advance of his bateau with the medical stores. This did not arrive until the 30th, with Col. Arnold and the rear of the army. The bateaux with the supplies were now going around Ticonic falls, and as \" the river for about two miles above the falls was exceedingly swift and the water shoal,\" the crews of the boats \" were obliged to take to the water,\" some pulling at \" the painter, others heav- 1 President Allen. * Senter's Journal, p. 16."], [151, "1775.

In the rapids the water was in general waist band high, and the stream was so violent as many times to drive the boats back after ten or twelve fruitless attempts in pulling and heaving with the whole boat's crew.\" l The bateaux were slightly made of green pine, and some of them began to \"leak profusely,\" and the bottoms of many were badly worn upon the ledges and rocky bed of the river. The army seems to have been destitute of skillful bateaux men, a few of whom, with strong arms, steady hands and the skill which is only acquired by long experience, could have safely impelled the boats forward against the turbulent current. Arnold, aware of this, said, \"The men in general, not understanding bateaux, have been obliged to wade and haul them for more than half the way up the river,\" and would have been taken \"for amphibious ani mals, as they were a great part of the time under water.\" 2 Sen ter's boat's crew consisted of three English sailors, one old Swiss, and a young Scotch deserter from the British army at Boston, and it is not surprising that when his medical stores arrived at Fort Halifax they had to be placed in another boat ; nor is it more surprising that when the army arrived at the foot of the Norridge wbck falls \" many of the bateaux were nothing but wrecks,\" and others in so leaky condition that the dry fish were wet aud ruined, the casks of bread swelled, burst and the bread soured. The same fate attended a number of casks of peas. These were all condemned, and the expedition was curtailed of a large and val uable part of the provisions before entering the wilderness. Their fare was now reduced to salt pork and flour.2 Most of the army had arrived at Norridgewock on the 7th of October, and all left that place on the 9th. At this time disease began to appear among them. From the 10th to the 12th of October they reached the Great Carrying place, some forty miles from Norridgewock, and \"three days march into the wilderness from any improvements whatsoever.\" This celebrated portage is through the third range of townships of the Bingham purchase, in latitude 45\u00b0, 15', and is about fourteen miles long from the Kenne bec to Dead river. It is divided into four carrying places by three ponds. The first carry is three and three-fourth miles to the first pond, which is one fourth of a mile wide ; the second carry a 3 Senter's Journal, p. 9. 1 Senter's Journal.

From this the fourth carry of four miles reaches to Dead river.' This portage was crossed by the army with great difficulty and much fatigue, the men \"being obliged to carry all the bateaux, barrels of provisions, warlike stores, &c, over on their backs, through the most terrible piece of woods conceivable, with mud sometimes knee deep.\" Many of the men were in bad con dition with the diarrh\u0153a. The ponds were low and the water yellow and bad. On the 16th it became necessary to erect a block house for the \"formidable number \" of sick, which was \" no sooner finished than filled.\" On the 18th the third and last pond was crossed, when Maj. Bigelow was met on his return from the advance party with twenty-seven men, in quest of provisions. Arnold having given orders for invalids, \" as also the timorous \" to return, went forward in the advance of Morgan's division. \"He carried no stores except a small quantity of specie, attended with a good pilot in a British canoe, hands sufficient to carry every thing over the various carrying places and proceeded by water with great expedition.\"2 On the 20th, while on Dead river, an ox which had accompanied the army to that time was killed sfnd every man received a piece. The next day a severe storm pre vailed and \"Dead river became a live river;\" the water rising eight or ten feet, overflowing its banks and making it difficult to ascend. On the 22 1 the rear came on half allowance of provisions as the advance had been for some days. The bateaux were diminished in number, some were broken against the banks, others were so leaky as to be condemned, which increased the burden of the remaining boats. Every moment of daylight was now im proved to press forward. Orders were given to \"cook every night to last through the next day, and this in the most frugal manner by boiling only.\" Necessity now obliged the army to double their diligence. As they advanced the river became rapid and narrow and the land mountainous. On the 24th several boats were met returning from the advanced divisions with invalids. Senter was exhorted to return, and was informed that all, except a few that were far in advance with Arnold, were returning. But ho resolutely pushed 1 Henry, in his Journal, calls it \" the twelve mile carrying-place.\" 2 Senter's Journal, p. 17."], [153, "1775.

With the boats they lost several barrels of provisions, some cash, clothes and guns. By the upsetting of one Mr. Henry narrowly escaped drowning.1 \u2022 The velocity of the water increased as they advanced, and \"a direful howling wilderness not de scribable \" was before them. They soon, however, came up with Col. Green's division, waiting for provisions of which they were destitute, having only a few candles which were boiled with water gruel for supper and breakfast. \"Now,\" says Senter, \"every prospect of distress came thundering on with a two-fold rapidity.\" Snow had covered the ground, attended with severe weather, and they were compelled to stop for Enos to come up with provisions. Expresses were sent up the river to inform Arnold of their con dition, and down to hasten up Enos and his officers to attend a consultation. When the latter arrived a council was held. This soon showed who were men of high resolve and determined pur pose, prepared to surmount the obstacles in their way and press forward. Senter says, in an account of the meeting, \" Here sat a number of grimacers, \u2014 melancholy aspects, who had been preach ing to their men the doctrine of impenetrability and non perse verance ; Col. Enos in the chair. The matter was debated upon the expediency of going to Quebec. The party against going urged the impossibility, averring that the whole provisions, when averaged, would not support the army five days.\" The condition of Col. Green's division as to provisions was examined, when \"very little\" was found. The other companies under Enos, having the bulk of the provisions, had not come up, either through fear that they would have to part with some, or express their unwillingness to go forward. The question was finally put to the council whether all or a part should return, and the majority decided that a part only should return . The officers voting for proceeding were Lieut. Col. Green, Maj. Bigelow, Capts. Topham, Thayer and Ward, five in number; for returning, Capts. Williams, McCobb and Scott, Adj. Hide and Lieut. Peters, a like number of five. Lieut. Col. Enos, in the chair, decided the question by voting for a part to go forward. But Senter says, that \" Col. Enos, though he voted for proceeding, yet had un doubtedly preengaged to the contrary, as every action demon- 2 Senter's Journal. 1 Henry's Journal, p. 55. 9"], [154, "1775. 130 Refusal to Divide Provisions. strated.\"1 The officers who were to go forward requested a division of the provisions. To this the returning party would not consent, declaring that they would either go back with what they had, or if they must go forward would not part with any. It will be recollected that this rear division took the largest amount of provisions, and as their proportion of bread was less, they lost less by the leaky casks. The part}' for proceeding was the weakest, and could not compel those for returning to a division. In this dilemma expostulation and entreaty were resorted to without effect. At length Col. Enos, who more immediately commanded the \"division of returners,\" was called upon to give positive orders for a small quantity of pro visions for those who were determined to advance. He replied, without making an effort, \"that his men were out of his power*, and that they had determined to keep their possessed quantity whether they went back or forward.\" They, however, finally con cluded to part with two and a half barrels of flour. This small pittance, the most that could be obtained, was accepted \"with a determined resolution to go through or die.\" They received the flour, put it on board the boats, left their few tents and camp equipage, \"took each man his duds on his back, bid the returners adieu, and were away.\" They were now \"one hundred and fifty four computed\" miles from inhabitants in Canada. Col. Enos returned with the whole rear division, consisting of Williams', McCobb's and Scott's companies. As this movement was without Arnold's orders, Enos was tried by a court martial in December following, and on the testimony of the \"returners \" was acquitted with honor,2 a result more favorable to him than a fuller knowledge of the facts would have warranted.

In the morning they started at twilight, and during the day came up with Morgan's party on a stream emptying into Chaudiere lake, where they remained during the 28th for the strag glers to come in. During their stay an express arrived from Arnold, who had preceded them to the Canadian settlements, with the in formation that the inhabitants were favorably disposed, and that he had their \"pledge of friendship in a loaf of bread.\" This was promulgated to the army to their \"unspeakable joy.\" They had now been fourteen days upon half allowance of such provisions as they had, and were yet one hundred miles from Can adian inhabitants. The provisions were ordered into a common stock and then divided, and the amount to each man was only five pints of flour. The pork was so small in quantity that it was not susceptible of division, not aniounting to an ounce per man. So small was the allowance and so hungry were the men that sev eral determining to have one full meal immediately devoured their whole allowance. Capt. Morgan's company with great labor had resolutely perse vered in carrying seven bateaux over the mountainous portage from Dead river to a stream entering Chaudiere lake. These fur nished the only means of transporting the military stores. The boats now descended the stream, while the army proceeded by a route supposed to be shorter by land in quest of the lake, which was thought to be but seven miles distant. However, on the 30th they had been three days wandering in the search through \"hideous swamps\" and over \"mountain precipices,\" suffering from cold, wet, hunger and fatigue, not to mention \" the terrible apprehension of famishing in the desert,\" when they finally reacked the river flow ing from the lake, and gave \"three huzzahs and encamped.\" Some men who were overcome with hunger and fatigue were left by the way and not heard from after. The next day they proceeded down the Chaudiere river, and soon came to the remains of Mor gan's seven boats, which were all wrecked upon a fall, by which the military stores and every thing on board were lost. One of his riflemen was drowned, and the rest of the men escaped only by swimming.

November 1st they were reduced to \"a little water stiffened with flour,\" and thought they \"had now arrived to almost the zenith of distress.\" Several had been without meat or bread for a number of days, particularly the wrecked boatmen and those who devoured their provisions immediately upon the division. The voracity of many rendered almost anything admissible. A poor dog belonging to the expedition was sacrificed and instantly de voured. \" The shaving soap, pomatum, lip salve, leather of their shoes, cartridge boxes, &c,\" shared the same fate. On the 2d of November they were scattered up and down the river for twenty miles. Necessity arising from their weak and famished condition obliged them to dispense with everjT incumbrance but a few tin kettles in which to cook the \"water stiffened with flour.\" Not even a hatchet was retained to cut wood. They had not marched more than eight miles this day when, in the language of Senter, \" a vision'of horned cattle appeared.\" Upon a nearer approach this vision proved reality, and \" echoes of gladness resounded from front to rear with a te deum.\" One American and eighteen Cana dians with three \"horned cattle\" had arrived for their relief, aud soon after two more Canadians came in a birch canoe laden with a coarse kind of meal and other supplies, of which each man drew a moderate allowance, upon which he cautiously fed. They were now within twenty miles of inhabitants and relieved from the ap prehension of famine, where we shall leave them and return to Col. Arnold whom we left hastening on to the Chaudiere in the advance part of Morgan's division. He reached Chaudiere lake on the 27th of October and em barked the next day with seventeen men in five bateaux, resolv ing to push on with great expedition to the French settlements and send back provisions to his suffering army. He passed over the lake thirteen miles and entered the Chaudiere river, which he descended at the rapid late of twenty miles in two honrs, when three of his boats were overturned and destroyed, losing his bag gage and provisions, and with difficulty saving the lives of his men. The river was exceedingly rapid and rocky, and of danger ous navigation. This misfortune he considered providential, as had he continued half a mile further he \" must have gone over a prodigious fall, which he was not apprised of, and all inevitably perished.\""], [157, "1775.

By the 8th of November the whole detachment arrived except the sick, among whom was Capt. Dearborn, who was left in a hut on the Chaudiere sick with a fever, from which his life for ten days was endangered without hope of recovery. Yet, without medicine, he recovered and joined his company. On the 13th of November the rear of the army had arrived at Point Levi, and Arnold crossed the St. Lawrence with five hundred men during the night of that day with great secrecy. In writing to Gen. Washington Arnold says, \"Thus in about eight weeks we completed a march of near six hundred miles '\u25a0 not to be paralleled in history ; the men having with great forti tude and perseverance hauled their bateaux up rapid streams, being obliged to wade almost the whole way, near oik- hundred and eighty miles, carry them on their shoulders near forty miles, over hills, swamps and bogs almost impenetrable, and to their knees in mire, being often obliged to cross three or four times with their baggage. Short of provisions, part of the detachment disheartened and gone back, famine staring us in the face ; an enemy's country and uncertainty ahead ; notwithstanding all these obstacles the officers and men, inspired and fired with the love of liberty and their country, pushed on with a fortitude superior to every obstacle, and most of them had not one day's provision for a week.\"* The next day, after crossing the St. Lawrence, the army marched within fifty yards of the walls of Quebec and gave three cheers, which were answered by some shots from the city. They were posted around the city so as to prevent as much as possible the enemy communicating with the country, and thus continued four days, when a council of war was called, which, upon ascertaining that the force was deficient in arms, without bayonets and field pieces, and that the amunition amounted to only four rounds per 'From Cambridge to Quebec. !

Gen. Montgomery led the right wing to the assault, on the bank of the river, where the city wall terminated, and the defence was a palisade. Col. Livingston was sent to attack and force the St. John's gate. Gen. Arnold, with the left wing moved to the attack where he expected to be opposed by small batteries before he reached the town, in which the two wings were to meet and move together in the assault. Added to the gloom of the storm, and! depth of snow, was \" a heavy darkness almost to be felt.\" Gen. Montgomery in moving against the strong palisade upon the river's bank, easily carried it, when a discharge of grape from a block house within, killed the General and disordered the column. In this crisis Col. Campbell succeeded to the command. He was not the man for the emergency, and ingloriously ordered a retreat, leaving his dead commander upon the field. Arnold in making his attack with the \" famine proof veterans \" passed the Palace gate, when an incessant discharge of cannon from the whole extent of the enemy's works shook and illumined the city. Fire balls were thrown from the walls, which burned notwithstanding the snow, and discovered his troops to the great advantage of the enemy's musketry. At the first battery which Arnold attacked he was wounded in the leg and returned to the hospital, leaving Col. Green in command. The battery was two twelve pounders, protected by a breast-work, on a high over hanging rock. Morgan's men rushed up, some fired into the port holes, while others mounted the barricade with ladders, carried the batteiy and made captive a captain and thirty men. Col. Green now waited half an hour for the troops who were struggling through the snow to come up, when he marched to the second bar rier, which he heroically assaulted, but the whole force of the enemy, since the fall of Montgomery, was concentrated at this point, and Green had to seek the shelter of houses to escape their incessant and murderous fire.

Mont gomery's division soon came straggling in with news of the disaster, followed by the enemy, who were routed by a well directed fire from two field pieces which Capt.

In this year the organized opposition of the colonies to the arbitrary measures of Parliament had ripened into a government which gained strength from the continued effort of its enemies to subvert it ; and the country had attained to that state of feeling which precluded all hope of reconciliation, and made exemption from colonial servitude a primary law of political existence. Unequal as the contest for independence was seen to be, the great body of the people readily committed themselves to it, with full determination to undergo its sufferings and brave its dangers. A few, who were connected with the long established order of affairs, could only see in the opposition of the colonies sedition and rank rebellion. But they soon awakened to a sense of their error, to witness in the progress of events the efforts of a great people struggling with hardy enterprise, under unparalleled diffi culties, for individual freedom and national existence. But one town meeting assembled in Hallowell in this eventful year. This was the annual meeting at Fort Western, at which town officers were chosen and \"a county treasurer and register voted for.\" No other business was transacted, and no money, raised for any purpose. A warrant to assess a tax of \u00a366, 6s. 4d, to defray the public charges of the \"State of Massachusetts Bay\" for this year, was not issued till February 7th of the next.

Their opponents were denounced as traitors and foes to their country ; all lukewarm persons were suspected, and the property of notorious tories was considered lawful plunder.3 The Rev. Mr. Bailey of Pownalborough, continuing to manifest his repugnance to whig measures, was in May summoned before the committee of correspondence and inspection, examined and \"laid under bonds;\" and in August was \"forbidden to pray for the king,\" a command he seems to have obeyed for a time by dis pensing with the usual service, \" only delivering a sermon \" to a much diminished congregation. But, in October, he was charged with political sins of omission as well as commission, and was again \"before the committee for not reading the Declaration of Independence, for praying for the king, and for preaching a seditious sermon.\" The result of this conference he has not re corded. However, he appeared determined not to yield to the dictation of the committee, notwithstanding he was \"besieged by the entreaties and tears of his friends to practice a little com pliance,\" which he said would \" only render his enemies fiercer.\"4 The General Court had organized the militia anew during the past winter.

The necessities of the times prompted the town, at the annual meeting, to vote to dispense with \" raising any money for preaching or other uses ;\" but the highways were provided with \"one day's work laid upon the polls, and eighty days upon the estates.\" Col. William Howard, Ezekiel Page, David Thomas, Jonas Clark, John Shaw, sen., Samuel Bullen and Levi Robinson were chosen \"a committee of inspection and safety.\" In April, James Howard was chosen a delegate to a county convention to be held at Wiscasset, in Pownalborough. Wiscasset, from her central position in relation to the settlements, was just starting towards the metropolitan position which she afterwards attained and held for some years in relation to the surrounding country. In June the town voted to dispense with a representative to the General Court, but feeling better disposed in relation to preaching chose a committee to procure a minister for \"two months upon pro bation, for settlement,\" and raised \"\u00a320 for preaching and other necessary uses.\" It was also voted, \"that lieut.

A motion to reconsider the vote failed, but not satisfied with this decisive result the town \"voted said John Jones inimical again.\" This settled the matter for Jones, who soon after fled, first going to James Winslow's, a sympathizing half quaker friend of his who resided on the east side of the river just below the town, where he remained over night, and was taken down the river the next morning, and thus escaped for a time, but was afterwards apprehended and arraigned before the court. Having disposed of Jones' case the town came to the con sideration of the meeting-house question, when it was voted to build a house, \"by way of a town rate,\" thirty-five by fifty feet, and twenty feet posts, and to settle the side of the river upon which it should be built \" bjr way of lots.\" \"The lots were drawn and the house fell to the east side.\" A committee was now chosen to procure a lot \"as near the middle of the town as can conveniently be got,\" and to procure timber and have the \" house ready to be raised by the 15th of May \" next. The coast was this year so infested with British cruisers that trade was seriously interrupted, and supplies of provision were difficult to obtain.1 The surrender of Burgoyne, which occurred October 17, cheered and revived the drooping spirits of the coun try, giving strength and encouragement to the cause of liberty. On the 15th of November the Continental Congress adopted articles of confederation, but no general laws could be made or direct taxes levied, except by ratification of the State Legis latures. But the States by general consent and legislative enactment gave force and effect to the recommendations and requirements of the Congress. The condition of the tories, who were a source of much anoy ance to the whigs by communicating information to the enemy, became daily more uncomfortable. The Rev. Mr. Bailey, who was looked to by a part of his flock for direction in political as well as religious affairs, was still able to maintain his position as missionary at Pownalborough.

They imagine it gives life and spirit to our opposition.\" Entertaining the views ascribed to them it is not surprising that the whigs should have attempted to frighten the \"parson,\" and to make his position so uncomfortable as to preclude his longer stay in the country. On one occasion, having been concealed in his house for five weeks, he received information that \"a design was formed against his life,\" and he immediately escaped, fleeing to Boston. On his way thither, at York, he \"encountered the bar barous exultation of the rebels \" on account of the just received news of the surrender of Burgoyne.

The warrants this year for assessing upon the town two State taxes of \u00a3124 9s. lOd. each, directed assessments on account of income and profits gained by trade, \" and by means of advantage arising from the war and the necessities of the community,\" ' a source and power of taxation which only the cause and necessity of the country could justify. A law was passed in September confiscating the estates of ab sentees, as the tories who had fled to the British were called. A long list of names is given in the act. Among them we find Sylvester Gardiner, Benjamin Hallowed, Robert Hallowed, Henry Laughton, William Vassall, John Vassall, William Taylor, Joseph Taylor and John Jones. This Jones was a mariner, and not the Hallowed Jones.2 Agents in each county were appointed to administer upon the estates of the absentees. Charles Cushing of Pownalborough was agent for the county of Lincoln. As agent for the estate of Sylvester \"Gardiner he leased to Joseph North of Pittston, now Gardiner, April 17, 1780, the grist mill, and single and double saw mills, \" called the Cobbosseecontee mills, together with the dwelling houses on the north side of Cobbosseecontee stream where Nathaniel Berry, Andrew Goodwin and Thomas Town live,\" also the barn and land improved by Berry and Good win, for one year, for which he was to pay the taxes and one-third part of the toll of the grist mill, and sixty-six thousand feet of merchantable boards, \" to be delivered at the place customary for the tenants to deliver the boards.\" 3 By a law of the previous year, conveyance of real estate by persons whose names were presented by a town as disaffected toward government was void.4 Ephraim Ballard, who had just removed to Hallowell, came into possession of John Jones' estate this year. Whether under these laws or by other means we are not informed.

The additional settlers on the tax list this year number nine.1 In the effort to create a navy government resorted to the Ken- nebec for masts and spars. Capt. Samuel Howard furnished this year \" The Honorable Marine Board for the Eastern Department\" with forty-eight masts, fourteen bowsprits, twenty-seven anchor stocks, and four thousand two hundred and ninety-nine inches of spars of various sizes. Some of the masts were so large that they could not be loaded upon the vessel which Howard sailed, and were towed at the stern to Boston. A few of the charges from Howard's account are presented, showing the size and prices of these articles : \u00a3 S. D.

In December she had \"thirty-six dollars to buy a gown of calico,\" making \u00a310 16s., so that the baize and gown amounted to more than a year's wages. So rapid, however, was the depre ciation of the currency that the payments, which continued to the end of the year, amounted to \u00a331 10s., with the memorandum that it \" completes one year's wages ;\" and the further entry was made, \"her wages to be \u00a360 hereafter.\" 1 Ephraim Ballard, John Church, j Ehenezer Littlefield, Samuel Cony, Solomon Cummings, | Amos Pollard, Samuel Cony, Jr., Beriah Ingraham, i Benjamin Smith."], [172, "1778. 148 District of Maine. \u2014 Meeting-House Located. Howard at this time received considerable \" sums of dead money and carried it into the loan office \" in Boston for various individuals on the Kennebec. He delivered to Mr. Guild of Boston one hundred moose skins to dress, for which service he was to pay ten dollars apiece. George Brown and Samuel Tollman enlisted this year in the service of the State for six months. The enlisting paper which they signed has an endorsement made by Capt. Daniel Savage, that \" Brown has enlisted to guard Gen. Burgoyne's troops.\" The territory comprised within the counties of York, Cumber land and Lincoln, into which the present State of Maine was at this time divided, was called and known as \" the three counties,\" a designation which is occasionally heard at the present day in proverbial sayings from the descendants of the early settlers. In this year Congress formed \"the three counties\" into a maritime district by the name of \"The District of Maine,\" when the new appellation was first used to designate them. At the annual meeting for 1779 the meeting-house that was to have been built near the centre of the town, on the east side of the river, was more definitely located \" on the eight-rod road that is allowed to run from the river at the north line of George Brown's land.\" This was near Pettengill's corner, between lots numbered twenty-eight and twenty-nine, and was the eight-rod al lowance nearest the centre of the town. But this location did not last long. At the next meeting held April 5th, the meeting-house was again under consideration, when all former votes relating to it were reconsidered. It was then located anew, \" upon the west side of the river, on the road between Col. Joseph North's and Asa Emerson's land, down on the interval by the river.\" This location, at which it was finally built, was at Market square, but it was voted not to build this year. Two hundred pounds were voted \" to procure preaching,\" and a road tax was laid of \"one day upon the poll, at thirty shillings per day,\" and an amount \" upon estates to bring it up to \u00a3200.\" Col. William Howard, Samuel Cony and Robert Kennedy were chosen a committee of correspondence. Town meetings which had heretofore been called by personal notice to the voters were now directed to be called by posting notices in writing at the fort, Howard's grist mill, David Thomas' house, Amos Pollard's house and Nathan Weston's store. These"], [173, "1779. Heavy Taxes. \u2014 Men Detached. 149 were the only public places in town, and were all at the fort settlement. The State taxes this year were very heavy upon the town. The first of \u00a3497 19s. 4d. was levied March 13th ; this was followed July 7th by another of \u00a35,025 15s. 7d., which was succeeded by a third December 13th of $3,803 6s. 8d. ; ' and besides the select men were required, under a heavy penalty, to furnish the families of non-commissioned officers and soldiers who had enlisted in the Continental army from the town with necessaries, in conformity with a resolve passed by the General Court for that purpose. The enemy having taken possession of Bagaduce, now Castine, on the 12th day of June of this year, a scheme was set on foot to dislodge them. Of the large force ordered for that pur pose six hundred men were drafted or detached from Gen. Cush ing's brigade in Lincoln county, to serve two months after their arrival on the Penobscot. Col. Howard issued on this occasion the following order : \" To Capt. Daniel Savage, commanding officer of the Eighth Com- pany of Militia, in the Second Regiment, in the county of Lincoln : Sir, \u2014 You are required forthwith to detach thirteen men from your company, yourself, one sergeant and one corporal included, armed and equipped in the best manner in their power, and fur nished with one week's provision, and march them immediately to St. George's, and there to be under the command of Col. Wheaton until my arrival or other superior officer of the regiment. William Howard, Lieut. Colonel. Hallowell, ye 26th of June, 1779.\" At the bottom of the order is a memorandum \" cattle, &c, will be turned out by the people at St. George's, so there will be no want of provisions.\" The quota of men ordered were detached and arrived at Camden July 5th, when Col. Howard ordered Capt. Savage to form a com pany by adding soldiers detached from three other companies, so as to make fifty men under his command. The expedition to which the town furnished its full quota was very unfortunate in its commander, Richard Saltonstall of Con necticut, who was also commodore of the fleet which was to act 1 Original warrants from State Treasurer."], [174, "150 Expedition to Bagaduce. \u2014 Disastrous Result. 1779. in conjunction with the land forces. The fleet, as well as troops, had been well supplied with provisions and munitions of war at great expense, and the public formed high expectations of the success of the enterprise. The forces arrived promptly in the Penobscot in twenty-four transports, accompanied by nineteen vessels of war mounting three hundred and forty-four guns, and made a successful landing which, however, was resisted by the enemy, who were driven in twenty minutes from their position, leaving thirty killed, wounded and captured. The loss of the Americans, who were more exposed, was one hundred, but the enemy was driven to the protection of his weak and incomplete works. An enterprising commander would now have followed up his success to the complete overthrow of the enemy, but the \"obsti nacy and wrong headed councils of Saltonstall \" frustrated every effort for vigorous action. Delay ensued until the appearance of a British fleet of superior force compelled a retreat. Saltonstall drew up his vessels in the form of a crescent to check the enemy and give his force an opportunity to escape by means of the transports. The enemy advanced to the attack, and discharged a heavy broadside into the American fleet, which threw it into con fusion and caused a disorderly flight up the river, where some of the vessels were taken and others destroyed to prevent their fall ing into the hands of the enemy. Four companies were formed of the dispersed troops under Gen. Wadsworth, and marched to Camden ; others went through the woods to the Kennebec, coming out at Fort Halifax. They were piloted by Indians, and the ad vance spotted trees as a guide for those who followed. They suffered much from hunger and fatigue in their weary tramp before they reached the settlements. The result of this expedition was disastrous in the great destruction of property and loss of reputa tion. A court of enquiry subsequently degraded Saltonstall, but honorably acquitted the subordinate officers. The new names added to the taxable list this year numbered nine,1 two of which, Cony and Williams, were long identified with the history and prosperity of the town. February 4th of this year, \" Cobbossee \" or the plantation^ of Gardinerstown was incorporated by the name of Pittston, in honor 'Phineas Allen, Samuel Cummings, Sherebiah Town, Benjamin Cotten, Thomas Poor, Seth Williams, Daniel Cony, Ephraini Town , Asa Williams."], [175, "1780. Convention at Wiscasset. \u2014 Public Debt. 151 of John Pitts, a Plymouth proprietor. The new town included both sides of the river. The petition for incorporation, headed by Col. Joseph North and signed by thirty others, was presented to the legislature in March of the previous year. A county convention was held at \" Wiscasset point\" to take some action in relation to the heavy' taxes upon the towns within the county. Samuel Badcock was chosen, October 30th, a delegate to this convention, and it was voted to allow him \"twenty-one dollars per day for the time he is necessarily employed doing said business.\" Badcock was also employed \" to procure a minister to preach as long as what money is voted will procure preaching.\" He doubtless was very faithful in discharging these duties, as the town, in October of the following year, voted, probably with an eye to the depreciation of the currency as well as his faithfulness, \"to allow Samuel Badcock forty-two dollars per day for procuring preaching and for attending at a convention held at Wiscasset, in the whole for eighteen days.\" The large debt which burthened the country at the commence ment of this year hung with a two-fold weight upon the people, on account of the deranged state of the currency, and the number of men who were taken from the pursuits of productive industry to recruit the ranks of the State and continental army. The nominal State debt was about two hundred millions of dol lars,' and the Continental Congress had issued Bills of Credit to a like amount, which formed almost the only circulating medium, and being greatly depreciated embarrassed all pecuniary and mer cantile transactions. To administer relief the \"General Assembly established a scale of depreciation,\" which was graduated monthly from January, 1777, to April, 1780. In January, 1777, one dollar in gold or silver was declared equal to $1.05 in the Bills of Credit of the United States ; in January, 1778 it was equal to $3.25 ; in January, 1779, $7.42; in January, 1780, $29.34, and in April of the same year it was declared equal to $40.00.2 This was the legally recognized rate of depreciation, but the actual depreciation was much larger, being in 1780 from fifty to sixty and even seventy-five dollars of bills for one of silver. A few items of account at this period will show the extent of the depreciation of the currency in the greatly enhanced prices, and 1 2 Williamson's History, p. 478. 2 Mass.

The scarcity of provisions at this time on the Kennebec, as well as the enormous prices which most articles had reached, was the cause of much suffering. \"Several families in the lower towns had no bread for three months together.\" 1 The Rev. Mr. Bailey says he had been \"witness to several exquisite scenes of anguish\" on this account, \"besides feeling in his own bosom the bitterness of hunger and the utmost anxiety for the subsistence of his family,\" and had \"seen among his neighbors the most striking horrors of nakedness and famine.\" \"It was impossible to procure grain, potatoes or any other species of vegetables ; flesh, butter and milk were equally scarce, no tea, sugar or molasses to be purchased on any terms, nothing in a word but a little coffee, with boiled ale wives or a repast of clams\" could be had, \" and not enough\" of these \"to satisfy the cravings of nature.\" Under such circumstances of destitution and suffering one would suppose that the Rev. Mr. Bailey would have gladly escaped from the \" persecution of his enemies \" by leaving the country, but all their efforts could not drive him away. He \"was advised not to leave as it was the design of his persecutors to expel the services of the church from the Kennebec.\" For this, and his regard for king and parliament, he braved the \" arbitrary measures of the magistrates,\" which he characterizes as \"unjust and merciless tyranny.\" But at length, despairing of the success of the royal cause, he became anxious to leave, when he found it difficult to obtain the consent of the council, which however was finally given on condition that he should not communicate to the enemy infor mation of the movement then in preparation against them in Rhode Island. He arrived at Halifax June 21, 1779, in destitute circum- 1 Rev. Jacob Bailey, P.

The Ken nebec froze over as far down as \"Judge Hill's in Phipsburg\" sufficiently strong to bear teams, and masts were hauled on the ice through Fiddler's Reach. The snow was uncommonly deep and did not disappear until the latter part of April. Casco Bay was frozen as far into the sea as the island called White Bull ; a like occurrence has not happened since. On the Hudson river, at Newburg, for forty days the water did not drop from the eaves. It was under depressing circumstances that the town of Hallo well held its annual meeting for the year 1780, a year of tribu lation, in which the town assembled at ten different meetings, and in which its assumed town and imposed State taxation was extraordinarily large, even if estimated at the legal rate of the depreciated currency. However, the town chose a committee of correspondence and safety consisting of Abishai Cowen, David Thomas and Robert Kennady, and testified its regard for both \"preaching and schooling \" by raising \u00a3200 for each, and mani fested a disposition to sustain the cause of the country by voting \" to raise money to hire men to serve in the service by way of rate for the future.\" The service rendered the country by its citizens was equalized in a novel way by voting \"that men who have done most in the service let it stand till others come equal.\" A com mittee was chosen to ascertain the amount of service rendered the country by individuals, by personal service or in any other way, and to hire soldiers in future on the credit of the town when requested by the State or Continental Congress. Lieut. Samuel and widow Cony's account for boarding the Rev. John Prince while he \" preached in the town\" was presented in town meeting and allowed. The next meeting held in May shows the inducements the town offered to soldiers to enlist, and the small value attached to the currency in which their bounty and wages were to be paid. It was voted at this meeting \"to give to each private soldier and non commissioned officer two and a half thousand feet of pine boards per month that goes into the State or Continental service, and for the town to have the State or Continental bounty and wages in lieu thereof.\" An additional \u00a3100 was raised for schooling.

This was followed October 24th by another tax of \u00a37,606 13s. 3d.2 The gold and silver tax was to create \"a fund to secure the re demption of the State bills,\" and the other taxes to pay the public charges and respond to the calls of the Continental Congress. These taxes were not assessed until January of the next year, when the gold and silver tax was assessed in \" old tenor,\" to the amount of \u00a3465 10s. fd.* An abatement having been made of a part of the onerous State taxes upon the county of Lincoln, Daniel Savage was chosen, on the 15th of June, a delegate to a convention at Wiscasset to apportion the abatement upon the several towns in the county.

The town voted to allow each soldier who went into the service for three months at Camden five hundred dollars; and \u00a312,000 was raised to pay the town's quota which served eight months at the same place. At the same time the town \"raised $1000 to pay Mr. Prince for preaching.\" This was Rev. John Prince, who was paid August 5, 1780, by William Howard, treasurer, \u00a3155 2s. As no further payment was made he probably did not remain to receive the full sum voted. The rapid decline in the currency rendered money taxes inade quate to supply the public treasury, and the Congress of the Uni ted States requested the States to furnish specific supplies for the support of the army.

With but one hundred and ten taxable polls, surrounded with difficulties and borne down with taxes, the town went 'resolutely to work to comply with the requirements of the State.

The British post at Bagaduce under the name of Fort George was a rendezvous for the tories in the eastern part of Maine, and from it they set on foot predatory expeditions to different parts of the State, by which they occasionally harassed the inhabitants and took captive some of the prominent whigs. John Jones signalized himself in this way by his adventures on the Kennebec. After he escaped conviction at Pownalborough the previous fall he was taken prisoner and confined in jail at Boston, from which he escaped and went to Quebec, to which place Rev.

Jones ; he is appointed to the command of a company of Roger's battalion. I am persuaded that his active and enterprising genius will be of great service in the department to which he belongs.\" In another letter he says, \" I send you this by our friend Jones, who is en gaged to chastise the rebels ; you must be persuaded that no man is better fitted for the service, both in point of knowledge and resolution.\" Again, in still another letter, he says, \" We were happily surprised last week with the company of Capt. Jones, one of our Kennebec neighbors. He is now engaged in the army, and intends to visit his country by way of Penobscot. His capacity is equal to his undertaking.\" Jones, after his visit to Mr. Bailey, went to Fort George on the Penobscot, which he made his headquarters and from which he commenced his expeditions to the Kennebec, au account of which he gave his friend Bailey in a letter dated September 4th, 1780. He says \"I have had two trips to Kennebec, one by land, the other in a whaleboat. First by land, I went up and down till I found where to strike. Thought best to bring [Col. Charles Cush ing] off. The way I proceeded was as follows : I surrounded his house in the morning very early ; sent two men to rap at the door; on his crying out 'who is there?' I answered 'a friend!' 'A friend to whom ? ' I answered ' to congress, and we are from George's river with an express, for the enemy has landed fifteen hundred troops from three ships.' He jumped up and came down with his breeches on, lit a candle and opened the door. We immediately seized him. On his making some noise his wife came running down stairs, but soon returned and put her head out of the chamber window and hallooed 'murder !

Having authorized the \"selectmen and commissioned officers \" to hire money on the credit of the town for the purpose, the meeting adjourned to the 27th of the same month, at which time the men not having been raised \" an additional fifteen guineas to each man who would engage to serve three years or during the war\" was offered. This however failed to procure the men, and February 12th a committee consisting of Ephraim Ballard, Daniel Savage and James Cocks was appointed to petition the General Court for \" relief of the beef tax and our quota of soldiers.\" At the annual meeting for 1781, held March 12th, it was voted, \" That the town if it think proper may raise money for preaching and schooling at some after meeting,\" and \"five hundred hard dollars\" were voted for roads, which had been much neglected. At an adjourned meeting held five days after, \"\u00a380 hard money, or an equivalent in paper currency,\" was voted \"to discharge town debts,\" and the last year's committee were allowed \u00a3240 \"for their time and expense in raising men to go to Camden in 1780.\" The inducements offered by the town not proving sufficient \"to <ret the continental men,\" the selectmen and commissioned officers were clothed with \"discretionary power\" to procure thorn \"in the best way and manner they can.\" At an \"after meeting\" July 10th the town voted \u00a350 hard money for preaching, but with commendable caution gave direc tion not to send for a minister until the money should be raised to pay him. The depreciation of paper money now in circulation had become so great that a \" new emission\" was resorted to, and as it was made a legal tender and was received in payment for taxes it main tained its credit for a while ; but early in the year it depreciated to about half its nominal value, one dollar being equal to forty in the old emission, or half a dollar in silver. In October one dollar of specie was equal to four dollars of new emission bills, after that they depreciated with the old emission. * A State tax, May 8th of this year, levied on the town \u00a3235 19s. lid., and June 22d a \"specific tax\" called for two thousand five hundred eighty-three pounds of beef, eleven shirts, eleven pairs of shoes, eleven pairs of stockings and five blankets for the comi- U"], [186, "Lumber a Standard of Values. 1781. 162 nental army. Another State tax, November 8th, called for \u00a3300 in silver money. Previously to the call for the last tax a town meeting was held to concert \" measures in relation to three beef taxes, at three differ ent times,\" and to consider the ever recurring question of paying the \"soldiers at Camden,\" also to provide the clothing required for the continental army. The meeting voted \"that the selectmen shall endeavor to procure the quota of shirts, shoes, stockings and blankets upon the credit of the town, if they can be procured,\" and authorized them to settle with the Camden soldiers, and directed Col. William Howard \"to send up the new emission money he has got in rates to the treasurer, in order to draw the interest, and likewise to send for the men's wages for their ser vices at Camden.\" These wages were doubtless paid, as Howard afterwards charged himself with having received, in hard money, \"\u00a371 9s. 4d. for wages of four men at Camden.\" By another entry \" one hundred seventy three new emission dollars\" were credited as received from Isaac Savage and Robert Kennady at seventy-five of old emission for one of new emission, amounting to \u00a33,892 10s. The same year \"sixty-four dollars new emission, Rhode Island and Hampshire money,\" were credited at forty dollars for one, amounting as entered in the accounts to \u00a3768. The bal ance of Col. Howard's account as treasurer was \u00a34,118 17s. 6d. in paper currency ; this reduced to hard money at seventy-five in paper for o\u00abe in silver was entered at \u00a354 18s. 4d. Lumber was at this time received in payment of taxes, and was regarded as the standard of values. Delinquent taxes, however, were required to be paid in hard money at a valuation \"equal to six and two-thirds dollars per thousand for boards, and one and two thirds dollars per thousand for merchantable shingles;\" and the town voted to indemnify Col. Howard, the treasurer, for money received into the treasury, \"in money or lumber, in the same man ner they do the soldiers who served at Camden.\" Another vote offered \"to make good any demand against the town in the same manner they pay Col. Howard and the Camden soldiers.\" The neglect of the town to raise their quota of men for the con tinental army brought a call by the General Court for the price paid for recruits to supply their places, with a fine for the neglect. The town assembled at Daniel Savage's house, December 19th of this year, to consider with other matters this call, which was"], [187, "1781.

A committee consisting of Col. Joseph North, Capt. Enoch Page and David Clark was appointed to procure the \" con tinental men,\" and the selectmen were instructed to petition the General Court in relation to them \" and- other of our difficult cir cumstances.\" This was after the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, in Virginia, which practically ended the war. The meeting-house question, which was usually connected with all important questions, again came before the town at this meet ing, when it was voted \" to reconsider all the votes that ever have been passed in this town in respect to building a meeting-house, and to begin all anew.\" The meeting then began anew by again locating the house as in 1779, \" on the road between Col. North's and Asa Emerson's land.\" It was then directed that the meeting house be built in 1782, and a building committee was chosen con sisting of Samuel Cony, Amos Pollard, Ephraim B\u00c6llard, Samuel Bullen and Abishai Cowen, and \u00a3150 raised to procure materials. The rate list for this sum was issued \" to be paid in lumber or the products of the land.\" A considerable accession of settlers was made to the town in 1780, whose names appear on the tax list of this year. They number thirty-nine.2 1 \u00a3770 17s. was equal to $2,575.78 at $3.38J to the pound, at which it was then reckoned ; and at the legal rate of depreciation, seventy-five in paper cur- rency for one in silver, would amount to $203,183.50 in paper. 2 Jeremiah Allen, Robert Fletcher, Capt.

At the annual meeting held at Elias Craig's house, Capt. Enoch Page, Ephraim Ballard and Dr. Daniel Cony were chosen a committee \"to see how affairs stand in town as to debt and credit,\" and it was again voted to build the meeting-house this year. But no money was raised for this or any other purpose. The inhabitants of the town having a freehold estate of the annual value of \u00a33, or any other estate of the value of \u00a360, were warned to assemble at the house of Thomas Sewall, April 1st, to vote for State and county officers. At this meeting John Hancock had twenty-three votes for Governor. Thomas Cushing had sixteen votes for Lieut. Governor. Samuel Adams had six votes for Lieut. Governor. Thomas Rice had twenty-three votes for Senator. This is the first meeting of record at which the town voted for Governor, and the second at which the number of votes given appear. The number is remarkably small for a population repre sented by one hundred and twenty-eight taxable polls. It was voted, at a meeting held the same day, that \" last year's constables should return their last year's assessments or rate bills that were assessed towards raising six men for the Continental army;\" also \"not to have town meetings warned by notifi cations.\" The next meeting assembled May 6th, and decided not to send a representative to the General Court, and the committee to look into the \" affairs of the town \" reported that the larger part of the assessments made by the town since its incorporation were un collected, and the committe were instructed \" to proceed and find out where all the money is which is behind.\" Two State taxes of \u00a3200 each, a county tax of \u00a318 6s. lid., also \" a bounty tax \" of \u00a317 4s. lOd. \" for soldiers enlisted in the county the summer past,\" were assessed.

Provisional Articles of Peace. 165 ing, on one occasion when the opposing parties became warm, it was necessary to take the sense of the meeting by polling the house, not so much probably from the large number present as the smallness of the room in which the meeting was assembled, when Deacon Cony, \" a remarkably mild man,\" led the movement in favor of the measure by calling out as he went to one side of the room, \" All who are on the Lord's side follow me,\" while Edward Savage, a sturdy, strong man, of rough manners, who was in opposition and not to be put down by the deacon's appeal, called out, \" All who are on the devil's side follow me.\" The deacon had the best company and the most followers, and carried the question.1 The meeting house although erected was not finished for some years. The floors were not yet laid, the outside was unfinished, and it was not even glazed, and could be occupied only in warm weather when no shelter was needed.2 The seaboard continued to be infested with the enemy's cruisers which intercepted and occasionally made prizes of \"the coasters,\" but not always without a struggle, as, in July of this year, Capt. Uriah Gardiner in a sloop from the \"eastward,\" with lumber, was taken within six hours sail of Boston, after a sharp contest of \"two glasses,\" in which Capt. Gardiner lost his life. The vessel that took him was armed with eight swivels, \"twenty-five small arms,\" and was manned with twenty-five men. Gardiner had two swivels, six men, \"and three small arms.\" The same day the sloop was retaken by a privateer from Marblehead and carried into Boston.3 On the 30th of November provisional articles of peace were signed at Paris ; by the sixth article it was provided \"that there shall be no future confiscations made.\" This was a relief to cer tain proprietors of the Plymouth Company and others whose es tates were in process of confiscation.

This error appearing, a resolve of the General Court dated October 2, 1782, authorized the cases to be brought forward as continued actions at the next term cf the court, and proceed ings to be had as if no default had been made, and that notice be given by a publication of the resolve.1 Before these proceedings could be had another resolve to carry into effect the provisional articles of peace stayed the proceedings and the estates were saved to their owners. The evil effects of an unsound currency were manifested this year in the case of Dea. David Patterson, one of the early settlers at St. George's river, and an ancestor of the Pattersons now in Augusta. The deacon, who was a worthy man and \"universally esteemed,\" had conveyed his estate to his son-in-law Reuben Hall and \"taken his notes for his maintenance.\" Hall upon marrying a second wife paid his notes in the legal but depreciated currency, which soon left the deacon destitute of property. His feelings would not suffer him to apply for assistance, and as winter came on he was in danger of perishing from cold. Under strong feelings of sympathy for him a town meeting at Warren was called to consider the subject, when, after it was ascertained that Hall was legally discharged, it was voted \"that the town be divided into six classes, and that each class should cut and haul five cords of wood for the use of Mr. Patterson.\" * This furnished him with an abundant supply. The annual town meeting for 1783 was held at the house of Thomas Sewall, at which the committee for \"carrying on the meeting house \" was directed \" to continue in that business until the \u00a3150 raised for its erection should be laid out,\" and the \"pew ground\" was directed to be sold and the proceeds applied to finishing the building. April 11th a proclamation announcing a cessation of hostilities was issued. The next meeting of the town assembled May 5th at the meet ing-house, which was probably the first time the building was occupied if the meeting took place in it.

Upon the rate bills for these taxes we find twenty new names.' When the town was called to act in the first year of its in corporation on the subject of roads, it decided to have two, one on each side of the river. The one on the west side was defined as \"up and down the river as the town run;\" the other on the east side \"from the south line of the town to Fort Western.\" Abotfe the fort, to the north line of the town, the remains of Shir ley's military road probably rendered a location unnecessary. These roads thus loosely indicated were probably marked by spot ted trees and partly cleared or cut out. However, the town the next year \"approbated the roads\" and gave the selectmen authority to alter them in their discretion. No further action was taken in relation to roads until 1773, when the town voted \"to have the roads run\" at the back end of the front lots, from lot num ber one on each side of the river to the \" upper end of the town.\" These were on the range ways, and it was determined that the abutters on these roads should pay for making them \"in pro portion to the land they own.\" They were not opened with the exception of a short distance on the west side.

Near the mile rock was formerly a ferry which was approached by this road. At the same meeting another road was \"approbated\" from the north line of Lieut. Josiah French's lot at the river, to the south side of said lot, and thence it passed on the south line to the west end of the same.1 This was traveled near where Western avenue now is. Traces of it were plainly to be seen for many years after it was discontinued.3 \u2022The two leading roads, one on each side of the river, were probably cut out and log bridges built over the water courses by 1779; but at that time no road had been laid out by definite courses and distances. In that year the selectmen were directed to \"perambulate the roads from Jones' mill on the west side to the lower end of the town, and on the east side from the lower end of the town up as far as Mr. Hersey's land.\" Hersey at that time lived on the \"Stone place,\" now owned by William Caldwell, Esq. The result of this examination by the selectmen was the location of the first road laid out by courses and distances by the town of Hallowed. The survey was made May 15, 1779. It commenced on the west side at Bridge's lower mill, now owned by J. P.

This was near the present Lock street. Deacon Samuel Cony, the progenitor of the Cony family at Augusta, came from Shutesbmy, Mass., in 1777, and settled on proprietor's lot number twenty-three on the east side of the river. Previous to this his son Samuel, who lived at Easton, came to examine the Kcnnebec country with a view to settlement. He was so much pleased with appearances at the Fort Western settle ment as to report favorably to his father, who sent his youngest son Daniel, in whose judgment he appears to have had much con fidence, to examine and report more definitely. Daniel came in the spring of the year, in \"fish time,\" and informed his father, among other things in a highly favorable report of the country, that the river was the \"meat tub \" of the inhabitants, so abun dant and so easily taken were the fish which thronged it. An other thing which pleased the deacon was the information that apple trees would flourish in the climate, as Daniel had seen some growing thriftily on the bank of the river.

Soon after, upon the call of his country, he left his young wife, and as adjutant of a regiment of infantry marched to join Gen. Gates at Saratoga. Here he is said to have volunteered to lead a party sent to the relief of a company on its way to join Gates' army. The ground over which they must pass was commanded by the enemy's battery. The officer who had been appointed to lead the men and whose place he took, declared the intended passage would be certain death ; but the young adjutant at the head of his men by his wary approach drew the enemy's fire, felt the wind of their balls, then dashed forward with his command unharmed. He was at the surrender of Bur goyne, but not in any of the battles which preceded that event. One morning after the surrender, when attending at headquarters for orders, the assembled officers were discussing who was the greatest general ; when Gen. Anthony Wayne who had attentively listened to the discussion said, impulsively, \" I will tell you who was the greatest general.\" All eyes were turned upon him, whr-n he declared authoritatively, \"Moses was the greatest general;\" aud he added a sentiment not very complimentary to David who bad overthrown an army of the Philistines with a sling. Daniel Cony soon resigned his commission in the army, and at the age of twenty-six came with his wife and one child, who died in infancy, to reside with his father, in 1778, at the fort settlement in Hallowed. Here he had a long career of usefulness. He first settled on the east bank of the river opposite the \"mile rock,\" where the remains of the cellar of his first house may be still seen, and near which, on the bank of the river, stands a Lombardy pop lar, a solitary sentinel of the past.

Doctor Cony early engaged in the active duties of his profession, in which he took a deep interest. He was on terms of intimacy and in correspondence with the leading medical men in Massachu setts, and was a member of the \"Massachusetts Medical Society.\" He was engaged in public life at an early period as representative, senator, and counsellor in the Massachusetts General Court, and was one of the electors who chose George Washington president, and John Adams vice president, for their second term. He was a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and a Judge of Probate for Kennebec county previous to the separation of Maine from Massa chusetts, a delegate from Augusta to the constitutional, convention of the new State, and was appointed Judge of Probate under that constitution, which office he held till his resignation by reason of age in 1823. Judge Cony was a man of vigorous intellect, sound judgment, quick perception and ready resource. He was uniformly success ful in whatever he resolutely undertook, was a strong ally, a safe and vigorous leader, and he attained to an influence with his fellow men which few acquire. Decision and firmness were conspicuous traits in his character, while he was always cool, calculating and sagacious. In his latter days the judge had an eccentricity of manner which was digr'fied and harmless, and rather added to than detracted from the interest of personal intercourse. We recollect when a boy attending meeting in the South Parish meeting-house, and seeing the judge walk up the broad aisle with a \" slow and measured tread,\" clad in a tartan plaid coat much like the morning dressing gown of gentlemen of the present day.

The judge lived with his sands of life slowly running out until January 21, 1842, when he, died without disease, at the age of ninety years. His physician, Dr. Issachar Snell, remarked that his case was the only one in an extensive practice in which he had known death to have occurred without disease, from old age. Elias Craig, who had been a private in the Revolutionary War, came from Wrentham, Mass., to Fort Western in 1779, at the age of twenty-three years. He was a hatter, and settled at the corner of Bridge and Water streets, where Merchants' Eow now is. He built a house and shop on this lot, and made hats for the early settlers. He was the first hatter in this region of country. His shop took fire and burned December 1, 1785. This is the first fire that is known to have occurred in the settlement. The next year he rebuilt his shop, and Gen. Henry Sewall assisted him on the mason work of setting his kettles. He was a very respectable man and possessed the confidence of the settlers, many of whom were welcomed to his house upon their arrival to settle at various places on the river. His house was enlarged from time to time, and remained upon the lot until the stores were built by Judge Bridge, when the judge removed it to his farm where it now stands, on Jefferson street ; it was owned and occupied by John Jones in 1860. Mr. Craig, December 21, 1788, married Hannah McKeck nie, daughter of Dr. John McKecknie. She died April 12, 1790, leaving an infant daughter Hannah, who married, when she came to womanhood, Bartholomew Nason.

North married Elizabeth Lewis, a woman of great per sonal beauty and of Scotch descent, by whom he had two children, Joseph North an early settler at Augusta, and Mary married to Dr. John McKecknie. His wife having died he married Elizabeth Pitson, daughter of James and Hannah Pitson of Boston, by whom he had a son William, known as Gen. William North of New York. Capt. North died at Fort St. George's March 26, 1763, aged about sixty-five years. His widow removed to Boston, where she died in 1789, aged seventy years, and was buried in the Granary burying-ground on Tremont street. Mr. Eaton says, upon traditionary information, that Capt. North's \"faculties had become impaired by age or disease in his last days.\" If this was so it must have been for a short period, for we find by the records at Wiscasset that he was present and presided with other judges at the last term of the court previous to his death, which was held September 28, 1762; and his remark that Capt. North \"was not able with all his popularity to escape the sus picions of the more jealous of the people that he was sometimes guilty of trading with the Indians,\" 2 reminds us that traditionary gossip \u2014 which sometimes has a vitality stronger than facts of authentic history \u2014 relates, that forts Halifax, Western and St. George's were built by Gov.

John North's eldest son, was born at St. George's river in 1739, and passed his youth with his father in the troublesome time of the early French and Indian wars. At the age of eighteen, when his father was appointed to the com mand of Fort St. George's, he was for a time in charge of the fort at Pemaquid. He seems to have acquired his father's business of a surveyor, and after his death to have removed to Boston, where he married August 28, 1764, Hannah Flagg, daughter of Gershom Flagg of Boston, a Plymouth proprietor. From Boston he went to Lancaster, Mass., where his sons John and Gershom were born. He next removed to Harvard, Mass., whither his father-in-law had preceded him. Here his son Joseph was born in 1771. The next year, 1772, he came to the Kennebec and settled in the plantation of Gardinerstown, on a five acre lot pur chased by James Flagg in 1762, upon which Flagg had built a house and barn. This was lot number two on McKecknie's plan, on the south side of Cobbosseecontee stream, and had been mort gaged to him by Flagg August 4, 1765,' whereby he probably acquired title. This lot he afterwards, in 1786, sold to Maj. Seth Gay, and the house in which he lived is the curbed-roof build ing now standing at the head of Gay's wharf, known as the \" old North mansion,\" and \"old post office,\" from having been occu pied many years by Maj. Gay for a post office. In this building his only daughter Hannah was born June 29, 1774, and his young est son James in September, 1777.

In 1780 he removed to the fort settlement in Hal lowed, and settled on lot number eight, west side, which he acquired in right of his wife. This lot extended in width from Market square to store number four Bridge's block, north of Bridge street. He erected his house at what is now the cor ner of Oak and Water street, where the Granite Bank buildin\" stands, making a clearing in the woods for that purpose before any road was laid out. He was frequently in town office in Hallowed, and was its first representative in General Court under the State constitution. He was appointed, in 1788, one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for Lincoln county, succeed ing Judge James Howard, which office he held until the organiza tion of Kennebec county in 1799, when he was appointed a Judge of the Common Pleas for that county, with Dummer, Cony and Bob bins. He continued in that office until a new organization of the Judiciary by the establishment of the Circuit Court of Common Pleas in 1811, remaining on the bench in Lincoln and Kennebec for twenty-two years. Judge North had a remarkable floral taste. He introduced into his garden, which extended on Water street from Oak street to the Franklin House \u2014 burned in 1865, \u2014 \"almost every flower which would bloom in our climate.\" This taste continued undiminished in extreme old age, when he exhibited on a larger scale rich beds of the rare and variegated flowers which had been a source of much gratification to him in his younger days. He died April 17, 1825, at the advanced age of eighty-five years. Hannah North, the judge's wife, was a remarkable woman. One who is competent to speak of her from a long and intimate acquaint ance, says : \" Madam North was a Boston lady of the old school. She had a good person, a cultivated mind, dignified and graceful manners, and being remarkable for her powers of conversation was the delight of the social circle.

After his father's death his mother removed with him to Boston, where he was edu cated and placed with a merchant with whom he remained until the port was closed by the British in the fall of 1774. In the next year he volunteered to accompany Arnold in his expedition to Quebec, but was prevented by sickness from proceeding. He early entered the Kevolutionary army ; was commissioned May 9, 1776, by the \"major part of the council\" of Massachusetts Bay, second lieutenant in Capt. Gill's company of Col. Craft's regiment of train artillery, and continued in the service through the war. He was commissioned by Congress captain in Col.

At the commencement of this period thirty years had passed since the erection of Fort Western in the wilderness at Cushnoc ; twenty years since the close of the war which ended the dominion of France in .Canada and gave to the English undisputed posses sion of Maine ; and thirteen years since the incorporation of Hal lowed. During the last brief but eventful period an Independent Empire of States had arisen in America, and civil society which for years had been in preparation for this event, was to be moulded by new influences, to conform to new institutions of government, which were to give it increased energies and a higher development. The exhausting efforts incident to the protracted war of the Revolution had left the country prostrate in its industrial pursuits ; commerce, restricted and embarrassed by the coast wise vigilance of the enemy during the war, had nearly died out ; manufactures originating in the necessities of the times were new and unskilled, and agriculture had made but little advance, the effective force of the army having been drawn from the fields of husbandry. To ascertain the condition of the people and the amount and kind of their property, the General Court this year required the assessors of each town to return such statistical information as would facilitate these inquiries. The return made by the assessors of Hallowed presents a clearer view of the condition of the inhabi tants, at this period, than can be obtained from any other source.

The apples which enabled them to do this probably grew on the trees which seven years previously determined the deacon in the selection of his lot. The population of the town at this time, as returned by the assessors, was six hundred and eighty-two whites and ten blacks. The polls were one hundred and eighty-seven, of which thirty were not ratable, probably from age and bodily infirmity. Only thirty-eight dwelling houses are returned ; a number so disproportioned to the inhabitants as to induce the assessors to append the following explanatory note to their return: \"As it may be supposed by this list that there are a considerable number of families which live without any houses, we would inform that a great part of the inhabitants still live in their log huts or camps which they first built, which are neither tenantable or ratable and of very little value. At most there are not above twenty houses in the town that arc any ways comfortable or convenient.\" The barns returned are 41 ; the horses three years old and up wards 52, one and two years old 15 ; oxen four years old and up wards 152 ; neat cattle three years old 48, one and two years old 7 3 ; cows four years old and upwards 224 ; sheep 172. The pas turing and mowing returned is quite disproportioned to this amount of stock, but the meadows furnished hay in part for winter's use, and the woods pasturing in summer. Their cattle, sheep, swine and even geese were marked, designating ownership. The marks were entered on the town records to the number of fifty-seven as late as the year 1795.

Nathan Weston's store was near his house, at the foot of the present Court street,2 on the bank of the gully which was then there. This was another convenient point of access from the river. The course of travel from Brooks' store, before the roads were cut out, was by the shore of the river to Weston's, and thence pass ing up the serpentine course of the gully reached the flat, near where the Potter house3 stands, at the corner of State and Green streets. At this time only five buildings had been erected between Brooks' and Weston's stores. One was an old house on the bank of the river \"forty rods from Ballard's brook,\" occupied by Joseph Far ley ; the house of Elias Craig came next, at the corner of Bridge and Water streets, where Merchant's row now stands ; then Col. North's house upon the site of the Granite Bank building at the corner of Oak and Water streets ; and the meeting-house at Mar ket square, and Amos Pollard's \"new house\" which afterwards was a part of Kennebec Hotel. But Farley's house was not con sidered \"ratable\" by the assessors, and Elias Craig's, which was marked ratable on a memorandum of the assessors, was not, upon a revision of their doings, returned. Ephraim Ballard at this time was operating his saw-mill which John Jones built on Bond's brook, and Cyrus Ballard his son the grist-mill at the same place. On the east side of the river the Howards traded at the fort, and Henry Sewall at the eddy near the town landing. Next above him Thomas Sewall, who was a tanner, had built the house now owned by Allen Lambard, and in the ravine where the foundry is he had a tan-house and vats. At this point, in making preparations for the tan-yard, a beaver dam was discovered. Upon removing it a large horseshoe of skillful workmanship was found. The early day at which this memorial of civilization must have been dropped has given rise to speculation as to its origin. The most probable solu tion of the mystery was suggested by a descendant of Anthony Faught, who said it was doubtless stolen by the Indians in some early foray and dropped at an encampment, or lost from a trap which it was intended to secure. At the Ellis brook Howard's grist-mill and three saw-mills were in operation. 1 Town Records. 5 Judge Weston. 3D. Williams's MS."], [219, "1784. Hook Burying- Ground. \u2014 Social Visiting. 191 At the Hook, Isaac Clark, who upon the death of his father Pease Clark had removed from above Howard's mills to that place, built the first two-story house in the settlement on the lot where Means' bake-house now stands, in which he kept the first \"house of entertainment.\" Near his house, where the Dole and Stickney store is, was the first burying-ground.1 Briggs Hallowed about this time lived down by the Bombahock stream, and one of the Prescotts had a grist-mill of one run of stones on the stream at Louden hill. The road at this time through the \" Hook settle ment\" was cut out about ten or twelve feet wide, and the cord wood which was shipped by the settlers, on account of the uneven ness of the road was hauled on sleds in the summer to \" Vaughan's point,\" where it was received by vessels.2 The settlers kept up social intercourse with their distant friends and acquaintances. In January of this year, Henry Sewall in com pany with Thomas Sewall and his wife left for Georgetown. They reached Ridley's in Pownalborough the first night, White's the next day at eleven o'clock, where they dined, and proceeding by the way of Mr. Trott's arrived in Georgetown in the evening. Here they remained two days, when they crossed the river by way of Col. Lithgow's, where they dined, aud proceeded to Col. Sewall's at the Reach, where they lodged ; and \"being helped by the colonel through a new route to the bay,\" arrived home that evening. A party took a sleigh ride to Ebenezer Farwell's in Vas salborough, and returned the same evening.3 Rev. Mr. Merrill preached at this time at the fort settlement, most of the time at \" Pollard's,\" the meeting-house being unfin ished. His preaching was not acceptable to Capt. Henry Sewall, who soon discontinued his attendance. Letters came tardily at this time, by private conveyance only. On the 25th of February Capt. Sewall went to Cobbossee for three letters from his partner Burley, sent by a Mr. Pickard ; and David Sewall and his wife having arrived from Georgetown on the 27th, their return furnished a convenient opportunity to forward his answers.4 On the 17th of March, John Lee, a brother of John Jones' wife, whom we have already noticed as included in the act relative to absentees, was arrested and brought as a returned absentee before 'Rev.

Samuel Howard, a brother of one of the magistrates. Henry and Thomas Sewall and Elias Craig built a \"great canoe\" in company this year. This was a commodious family vehicle, which they \"launched\" early in the season. The first recorded trip she made was of a Sunday in taking her owners and others to a meeting at Pittston, now Gardiner, where they heard the Rev. Mr. McLean preach.2 On the 3d of July, Henry Sewall set off in the \" great canoe,\" with his brother Jotham and Miss Tabitha Sewall, his cousin, for Bath, where they duly arrived, and the next day being Sunday the great canoe bore them and others to Georgetown, to a meeting where they heard the Rev. Ezekiel Emerson preach, in the fore noon, and Rev. John Murray in the afternoon. The next day the wind being adverse, Henry took his horse which was at George town and rode home, where he was joined by Jotham a few days after with the \" company's boat.\" Capt. Sewall went to Fort Halifax on the 7th of August for the purpose of \"circulating letters to all his debtors.\" Trade was probably not very brisk, for we find him October 6th working at his trade with his brother Jotham \"on Pollard's chimney.\" On the eighteenth of the same month he sent by Capt. Nathan Wes ton's sloop to Capt. Burley \"a sum of money raised by subscrip tion, to purchase glass, putty, &c, to glaize the meeting-house.\" A journey on horse-back to Boston to purchase goods, performed by Capt. Sewall, will show the route and mode of traveling at this time. He started December 14th, proceeding on the eastern side of the river to Pownalborough, where hearing that the Eastern river at Kidder's ferry was impassable on account of ice, he went higher up the river to Edmund Bridge's, where he lodged.

Here he stopped eight or nine days. On resuming his journey he reached Newburyport the first evening and lodged with his friends. The next day he reached Cambridge and stopped at Stephen Sew- all's, with whom he remained a day, and then went into Boston and put up with his friend and partner in business Burley. Having finished his business in Boston he rode to Roxbury to visit Gen. William Heath, with whom he dined and remained till the next morning, when he returned to Cambridge. Starting from Cam- bridge on his return in the forenoon of the next day, he reached Rowley that night. From thence he proceeded to Newburyport the next morning and tarried with his friends till the succeeding day; when he crossed the Merrimac, at Amesbury ferry, and reach- ed York the same evening. Here he remained six days, when he left for Kennebec and reached his uncle Titcomb's at Ken- nebunk the first night. The next day he rode to Biddeford and dined with George Thatcher, and reached Mr. Ingraham's at Fal- mouth in the evening. In the afternoon of the succeeding day he rode to North Yarmouth and put up at Loring's ; from thence on the morrow proceeded by \"way of Flying point, dined at StorerV and arrived at Bath in the evening. Here he found his goods had arrived in Howard's sloop.

At the annual meeting this year, \u00a350 were raised for preaching. and Ephraim Ballard, Samuel Dutton and Joseph North were chosen a committee \"to procure a gospel minister to preach upon probation.\" \u00a3200 were raised for highways, and \"\u00a350 for sup port of poor and other necessary uses.\" This was the first money raised for the support of the poor, and the first pauper of which we have an account was \"the black child,\" oi whose name and parentage we are not informed. The treasurer was directed to \" make the best he can of the paper money that he has in his hands as rates,\" and was required to \" receive the paper money collected as rates and sent back from Boston to this town.\" 13"], [222, "194 Annual Meeting 1785. 1785. At a meeting April 5th, the town balloted for State officers. James Bowdoin had fifteen votes for governor, and John Han cock seven. Thomas Gushing had thirty-two votes for lieutenant governor, and Gen. William Lithgow forty-one for senator. The road \" from the south line of Amos Pollard's land where he lives down to Mr. Trescott's mill brook, so called,\" was accepted. This was from the south line of the lot on which the \"old Pitts house\" stood, at the corner of Green and Grove streets, to the small stream at Louden hill. At the annual meeting for 1785 Daniel Cony was for the first time chosen town clerk, and the records began to assume a more regular form. The warrants were recorded, and the proceedings verified by the signatures of the moderator and clerk. After choosing the usual officers, and raising fifty pounds for preaching, and two hundred for highways, and voting \" to build stocks,\" an adjournment was had to eight o'clock the next morning, at which time the town assembled at the meeting-house but immediately adjourned to \"Amos Pollard's, Innholder.\" The house in which Pollard then lived was a part of the Kennebec House, built the year previous in Market square, then an \" eight rod allowance.\" The first business after assembling at Pollard's inn was to vote the proprietor half an acre of land on which his house stood, in consideration that he should procure of Col. Joseph North a half acre where the meeting-house stood. Pollard's Half acre was bounded three rods on the river, and was twenty-eight rods long, making an excess of \" four poles, which,\" according to the record, was \" reserved for a road across said lot ;\" and the lot which Col. North was to furnish in exchange was three rods on the river and twenty-seven rods long. The selectmen were directed to \" give a deed to Mr. Amos Pollard, under their hands and seals, in behalf of the town, when Col. Joseph North shall give a deed of the other described piece in lieu thereof.\" This conveyance Col. North made on the twenty-ninth of the following November, in consideration of thirty pounds, which Pollard probably paid. The town having thus arranged for disposing of land which they doubtless were persuaded they owned, proceeded to strengthen their claim by accepting the eight rods between lots number seven and eight, now Winthrop street, for a road, which was laid out March 12th, three days previous to the meeting. It was described as \"beginning at the east end of the north line of lot number seven, thence running west northwest on said line for the south-"], [223, "1785. Road. over \"Trout Brook.\" 195 erly line or bound of said road, being about two or three feet south of Mr. Pollard's new house,\" and by sundry marks and stakes to a dead white pine tree at the top of \" Burnt Hill,\" and by sundry marks and stakes \" eight rods to the northward, for the northerly bounds of said road.\" Water street was laid out the first of March of this year and accepted at this meeting. It commenced in the south line of lot number ten, at the road Dr. Williams had laid out the year previous, and ran back of the Piper house, and then by a change of course to a \"stake east of Joseph Farley's old house,\" thence past Elias Craig's house two rods easterly, and twenty-one links from Col. North's house, and two rods from the meeting house, and one rod and seven links from the front door of Amos Pollard's new house, and two rods from Nathan Weston's store ; thence up the hill by two courses past Amos Pollard's old house and four feet therefrom ; thence nearly one hundred rods by a course west of south to the road \"laid by Dr. Williams.\" The town in accepting this road, fixed the width at two rods, except the course through Nathan Weston's land, which was \"to be twenty feet wide.\" This narrow part was at the foot of Court street, and crossed the gully by a bridge subsequently built. Another road was laid March 11th, the day before the meeting at which it was accepted, commencing at the old Farley house on number nine and running northerly forty rods to \"trout brook\" two poles and thirteen links west of William Brook's store ; and thence continued across the brook, on the bank of the river, and up the hill near where Judge Bridge's house formerly stood to the road which came from Vassalborough, \u2014 now Sidney, \u2014 down to Ballard's mills. This road was two rods wide. Capt. Henry Sewall, Joseph North and Dr. Daniel Cony were chosen a committee to petition the Court of Sessions to lay out a road from Amos Pollard's ferry, on the east side of the river, to \"the public road.\" Committees on each side of the river were appointed to select lots for burying-grounds. The votes thrown this year for governor were, for James Bow doin thirteen, Samuel Adams seven. For lieutenant governor, Thomas Cushing twenty; for senator, William Lithgow, Jr., twenty-two.

This neglect was probably owing to the expense attending representation, which was borne by the town, but the General Court finally imposed a fine upon negligent towns to remedy the evil and compel the election and attendance of members. Upon the solicitation of some of the principal inhabitants of Pownalborough, James Howard, Joseph North and Ephraim Bal lard were chosen a committee to join with other towns in the county in petitioning the General Court for a term of the Supreme Judicial Court to be held in the county of Lincoln.

Seth Noble,\" who had preached a number of sabbaths, \"to continue his services in this town until the middle of March next.\" The en deavors of the committee were successful, and Mr. Noble- preached sixteen sabbaths, for which the town paid him \u00a326 10s.1 The doctrines however of Mr. Noble were not acceptable to Capt. Henry Sewall, who absented himself from his meetings and met Sundays for worship with a number of persons at Benjamin Pet tingill's house, at what is now Pettingill's corner.2 Notwithstanding the engagement with Mr. Noble, when the Rev. William Hazlitt appeared, a short time after, with a letter from Samuel Vaughan of Boston to the committee of the town, recommending him and proposing that the town should employ him, a meeting was called for November 29th, at which the letter was read, and Joseph North, Henry Sewall and Daniel Cony were chosen a committee to return the thanks of the town to Mr. Vaughan for his \"very generous offer and proposal to the town respecting Mr. Hazlitt.\" The same committee was desired to request Mr. Hazlitt to continue his services for two months. He officiated fourteen Sabbaths, for which he was paid \u00a321.' Sewall heard him preach in the forenoon of November 13th, and declared him an Armenian, and believed him an Arian, and said, \"from such doctrines I turned away, and met with a few brethren at Esq. Pettingill's in the afternoon.\" * A circular letter was received from Peleg Wadsworth and others requesting the town to send a delegate to a convention to 1 Treasurer's book. 2 Sewall's Diary. 3 Ib. 4 Ib."], [225, "1785.

This was laid before a town meeting which complied with the request by choosing Daniel Cony delegate. This being a very grave matter Dr. Cony cautiously requested instructions for his guidance, which the meeting for some cause declined to give. The action of the town in relation to Mr. Hazlitt and their dele gate to Falmouth seems to have created a ferment which resulted, December 20th, in a call for a meeting for the twenty-sixth of the same month, \"to see if the tow1!! will reconsider all the votes passed\" at the last meeting, and to see if they will hire Mr. Hazlitt to \"preach on probation for settlement,\" also send a dele gate to Falmouth \" and give him instructions.\" This meeting assembled at the meeting-house and chose Col. North moderator, when the article to reconsider the votes of the former meeting was dismissed. It was then voted to hire Mr. Hazlitt \"upon probation,\" and the article in relation to choosing a delegate having been dismissed Dr. Cony remained the delegate by previous election. A committee was then chosen to draft in structions \" for the town's delegate,\" and the meeting adjourned to four o'clock in the afternoon, at which time Col. Howard, who was of the committee, declined serving and Lazarus Goodwin was chosen in his place. The committee not being prepared to report, a further adjournment was had to six o'clock in the even ing, at the house of Amos Pollard. At Pollard's the committee's report was made and adopted \"paragraph by paragraph.\" Its commendable caution, candor and integrity of purpose are worthy of the important movement they were invited to assist in initiating. It is as follows : Instructions to Delegate. Hallowell, December 26, 1785.

That though none of the above objections should arise against the formation of these three counties into a separate State, yet that the measure shall be opposed, unless we proceed upon the principle of still continuing a part of the Federal Union. 5th. That we are determined to act like men of honor, and therefore that we shall still consider ourselves as honorably bound to continue to pay our full proportion, agreeably to the present valuation, towards the discharge of the general debt of the continent until the whole of it be paid off.1 Noah Woodward, Chairman Enoch Page, Samuel Dutton, J- Committee.

The latest date on record at which the ice left the Kennebec, at Fort Western, was in the spring of this year. The recollection of the incident is connected with the burial of Lieut. Samuel Howard, who lived on lot number one, west side of the river, and deceased April 20th. His corpse was brought on a sleigh, on the ice, to> Col. Howard's at the fort on the twenty-second by Thomas Rear don and Samuel Cony, who was then a young man,1 and the lieu tenant's widow after the funeral was drawn across and down the river in a sleigh by men in the afternoon. Tradition says the ice left the night of the burial, but records show that on \"the twenty fourth people crossed to Fort Western on the ice,\" which moved down the river on the twenty-fifth and was running past the fort from the upper Kennebec as late as May first.* At this time, from the river being so long closed, the expected vessels with supplies were detained later than usual, and there was a scarcity of supply and \" great cry for provisions.\" But on the 4th of May Capt. Samuel Howard and Capt. Smith arrived with their vessels at \"Pollard's Eddy,\" which gave seasonable relief. Two days after Capt. Weston with his vessel and usual supply arrived. 1 Original Report. 2 Rev. J. H. Ingraham on the narration of Dr. Daniel Cony. 3 Mrs. Ballard's Diary."], [227, "1785.

Mr. Kinsman preached occasionally in the town this year, at the dwelling houses of Thomas Sewall, Jeremiah Ingra ham and Benjamin Pettingill. On one occasion Henry Sewall went nineteen miles to Jones' plantation, \u2014 now China, \u2014 to hear him, and returned in the evening of the same day. The Rev. Mr. Miller, of Brunswick, delivered a lecture, and Rev. Mr. Pendens preached Fast-day at Thomas Sewall's aud delivered a lecture at Benjamin Pettingill's. Rev. Ezekiel Emerson of Georgetown also officiated in town, which pleased Capt. Sewall, who said his preaching was \"food indeed.\" 2 June 20th, Daniel Cony raised his house, now called the \" Toby house,\" near the Insane Hospital, which was an event of some importance. Mrs. Ballard accompanied her husband to the raising. Lime at this time came in hogsheads ; Henry Sewall purchased of a vessel at the Hook and brought up two hogsheads for himself, one for Dr. Cony and two for Col. North. The price was five dollars each. On the last day of August Moses Sewall brought a store frame from Bath and raised it at the Hook. Henry Sewall built a store and small house at the eddy on the east side of the river this year, and Col. Howard launched a schooner which he had built. Col.

Col. North, who as a member of the Plymouth Company was probably opposed to the new State project, presented a written protest against the illegal voting, which was entered on the record. It appears that a convention of thirty-three delegates \" from a number of towns in the counties of York, Cumberland and Lin coln,\" assembled at Falmouth at the time appointed and chose a committee of nine to \" state the grievances \" which they labored under, and estimate the expense of a separate government. The report made by this committee to the convention set forth the burdensome operation of the laws upon Maine ; her unequal rep resentation ; and complained of the \" present mode of taxation ;\" and the grievous operation of the \" Excise and Import Acts ;\" the \" duty on deeds;\" the \"regulations of trade\" operating to re duce the price of lumber; the distance, expense and inconvenience of attending the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts, and of making \" applications to the supreme executive authority;\" and from her \"local situation\" Maine's \"interests are different\" and \" cannot be fully understood by Massachusetts.\" The committee did not know what form of government the people would adopt, and therefore were not prepared to report an estimate of expense. This report was printed and sent to the various towns in the three counties, with a request that they would choose at their annual meeting delegates to an adjourned meeting of the convention to be held on the first Wednesday of the following September, and that they would certify to the convention the number of votes cast for and against the delegates.1 The proceedings of this convention were read in the meeting, and the question was submitted of sending a delegate to the adjourned meeting, which was taken by \" polling the house,\" when forty-three were in favor and thirty-one against the motion. Daniel Cony was then chosen delegate. At the same meeting Nathaniel Thwing of Woolwich, who had previously solicited by a letter addressed to the selectmen the votes of the town for reg ister of deeds, received fifty-five votes, being all the votes thrown for register. 1 Printed proceedings of the convention."], [229, "1786.

The committee on burying-grounds reported that Abishai Cowen would give a lot eight by ten rods on the west side of the road on his land; and Samuel Cummings one six by eight rods on the Winthrop road for burying-grounds, which the town accepted. \" Col.

Holding that the gospel dispensation was purchased by the death of Christ, in order that God might accept of an imperfect obedience from his creatures, instead of that perfect one which his law originally re quired. 2. Denying that Adam was created holy. Holding that he had only a capacity to generate holiness by a series of obedience. 3. Denying the total depravity of human nature in its unregenerate state. Holding it only in extent, not in degree. Asserting that unregenerate persons have a moral power, while such, to ask, and seek, and strive, in the gospel sense ; and that if they then improve common grace they will obtain special grace. 4.

Denying the saint's final perseverance to be founded in the power and faithfulness of God. Holding that if they do persevere it is by virtue of their own choice, and asserting that persons may apostatize from good beginnings, which if pursued would lead to saving grace. 7. Holding that the heathen, who are destitute of the light of the gospel, really do their duty in their worship even though they should hold to a plu rality of deities. That Paul was doing his duty while persecuting the church, and that we have no account in Scripture of his being reproved for that con duct. ' Entertaining the views Capt.

The subject of separation from Massachusetts attracted the at tention of government from the beginning. Strong opposition arose and well concerted measures of conciliation were adopted paralyz ing the action of the convention, which grew less spirited and finally died, after a number of adjournments, from the non attend ance of its members. The most important measure by which \"the subject was rocked into slumber\" was the establishment of courts at Pownalborough and Hallowed. The only courts at this time for the county ot Lincoln, which embraced the State east of Cumberland, were a term of the Common Pleas and a term of the sessions annually at Pownalborough. It was provided in 1786 that a term of the Supreme Court and an additional term of the Common Pleas and of the Court of Sessions should be held at that place, and Hallowed was made a half shire town by providing for a term of the Com mon Pleas and the Court of Sessions to be held annually at this place ; and the laws were directed to be published in the Falmouth Gazette, a newspaper published by Thomas B.

North's dwelling house.1 A town meeting was held November 27th \"to choose a delegate to give assent to and ratify the constitution for the United States,\" at which the constitution and accompanying resolves were read, \" also the arguments of several writers for and against the con stitution.\" Capt. James Carr was then chosen delegate.2 The convention assembled in Boston the following January, and on the 9th of February a vote adopting the constitution was taken by yeas and nays, resulting in one hundred and eighty-seven yeas and one hundred aud sixty-eight nays. The delegation from Maine stood twenty -five yeas to twenty-one nays, and Lincoln county nine yeas to seven nays. The question of adopting the constitution divided the people in Maine and Massachusetts into nearly equal parties. Those in favor of the constitution were called Federalists, and its opponents Anli Federalists, which division continued for several years until amendments of the constitution conciliated its oppo nents, and sympathy with the French, then in revolution, created new parties, based, however, upon the foundations of the old. The opposition to Rev. Isaac Foster which made its appearance at the time of his ordination had increased and strengthened. Meetings were regularly held on the Sabbath at Benjamin Pettin gill's or Henry Sewall's house, which were occasionally attended by clergymen from a distance. The difficulty was aggravated and the opposition increased by the institution of legal proceedings which grew out of the indiscretion of the parties. Capt. Sewall had been provoked to the utterance of a charge \" that Mr. Foster was a liar and he could prove it.\" Thomas Sewall was in some way connected with the charge. They were both summoned in January before Justice North, on a complaint to answer to the State. Capt. Sewall records that he \" did not pretend to deny\" the charge, but offered evidence of its truth in justification. 1 Sewall's Diary. 8 He had 62 votes, Brown Emerson 18, and Capt. H.

He was found guilty and fined fifteen shillings and cost. From this judgment he appealed. But Thomas Sewall who was fined twelve shillings did not appeal.1 Capt. Sewall's case came before the court at Pownalborough in the following June, when he \"feed Gen. Lithgow and Mr. Thatcher, who pleaded the absence of a material witness for a continuance.\" A question arose between the litigants whether the case should be continued to be tried at Hallowed or Waldo borough,2 in which they could not agree, and the Court refused a continuance. Thus Capt. Sewall \"was reduced to the dilemma\" of going to trial without evidence or \"paying up.\" He wisely chose the latter.3 The \" northern company \" of the militia in town elected officers April 12th, when Ezekiel Porter was chosen captain, John Shaw lieutenant, and Asa Williams ensign. August 6th Ephraim Ballard's saw mill on Bond's brook was burned. Col. North, Capt.

The grand jury were dismissed the third day and the jury of trials on the fore noon of the fifth day, \" after having only one cause committed to them.\" Rev.

The case was tried May 1st before Gen.

Paul Blake, an inhabitant of the town, was with great promptness dispatched by the Sewalls the next day after the service of the writs to Mendon, where Mr. Foster formerly preached, to procure evidence against him. He returned the thirtieth of the same month \"with the depositions of two of the committee for procuring preaching\" for that town. These re lated to \"Mr. Foster's preaching there.\" However, previous to this, on the 24th of May, Thomas Sewall had agreed to submit his case to the determination of Thomas Rice, Jedediah Jewett and George Thatcher, but Capt. Sewall with more resolution \"con cluded to stand on legal ground,\" ' and the action against him was entered at the June term of the court at Pownalborough, and continued by consent to the January term at Hallowed.

Isaac Foster shall make respecting a dismission from his ministerial relation and connection with the inhabitants.\" Daniel Cony was moderator of this meeting, to which Mr. Foster pro posed terms upon which he would dissolve the connection, which, however, were not acceptable to the town. The proposal was in writing, signed by Mr. Foster, and according to the record \" had two several readings in the meeting,\" when the question was put whether the town would accept the terms, \" and it passed in the negative.\" Mr. Foster was then invited to attend the. meeting by a committee chosen for that purpose, when he appeared and was asked if he had any further proposal to make.

The ques tion upon accepting this was put, \" and it passed in the negative.\" The meeting, probably to end the interview, then adjourned for five minutes, when it again assembled and proceeded to the con sideration of other business. Uneasiness still existed with many in relation to the unsettled state of affairs with the minister, particularly those who paid taxes for his support and could not conscientiously attend his meetings. At the request of a number of the inhabitants a meet ing was called October 30th, to see if the town would agree to have the contract with him cancelled, and should they not succeed in this, to see if the town in conjunction with the church would call an ecclesiastical council to hear, judge and advise in all mat ters of grievances that should be regularly laid before them ; and \" if no measures are taken to remove the grievances complained of, to see if the town will vote to discharge the disaffected, who cannot conscientiously attend upon Mr. Foster's meetings, from paying any tax for his support.\" Samuel Bullen was chosen moderator, and a committee appointed to treat with Mr. Foster in relation to cancelling his coutract. The meeting was adjourned for fifteen minutes to give an opportunity for the conference, when the committee reported that \"Mr. Foster bad nothing to offer with regard to an agreement, but that he would concur in calling a council if the town and church see fit.\" To this the town acceded, and proposed the council that ordained Mr. Foster with the exception of his two brothers, which was accepted by Mr. Foster, who \"nominated Mr. Williams and his church of"], [242, "214 Ecclesiastical Council. \u2014 Advice of Council. 1788.

At this meeting Nathan Weston, Samuel Cony and James Page were appointed a committee \"to wait upon Mr. Foster to see if he will ask a dismission agreeable to the advice of the council,\" after which an adjournment was had for half an hour, when the commit tee communicated Mr. Foster's answer in writing, to the effect that he would \" not ask a dismission upon the result of council,\" but as he had long been desirous that the connection should be dis^ solved he would abide by his former offer, and if the town were not willing to accept that, he invited a proposal from them. The town being armed with the decision of the council in its favor determined to take decisive action in the case, and rejected Mr. Foster's offer by a vote of seventy-four to seven. The pro ceedings and judgment of the Ecclesiastical Council were then read, and a lengthy vote passed, reciting; \"that whereas the Rev.

He was early in command of Fort Richmond, from which he was transferred to Fort Halifax in 1754, at which time he had been twenty years in the employment of government.1 He continued at Fort Halifax for some years after the war engaged in trade with the Indians, and became possessed of considerable property. Before the revolution he re moved to Georgetown, where he purchased a farm and erected a conspicuous house in which he dwelt the remainder of his days. He was a magistrate for many years, and was Judge of the Common Pleas with Denny, Hinkley and John North at the or ganization of Lincoln county in 1700, and in November 1775 was commissioned a Judge of the same Court with McCobb, Hinkley and Rice, under the revolutionary government. \" He possessed a fine natural disposition, facetious and pleasant manners, and was exceedingly hospitable in his house to rich and poor, and this was characteristic of all his family, who were remarkable for their genteel and elegant deportment.\" 2 He married Sarah Noble, daughter of Col. Arthur Noble, who was killed while in command of English troops in the battle of Minas, Nova-Scotia, in 1747. By her he had nine children, most of whom were cradled upon the borders of civilization in Forts Richmond and Halifax. His oldest daughter Sarah, celebrated for her beauty, married Capt.

He mar ried Ann, only daughter of John Gardiner of Pownalborough, who was a son of Dr. Sylvester Gardiner, and a lawyer of celebrity. Their son, Llewellyn W. Lithgow, is now a citizen of Augusta, and their daughter Louisa married Edward Williams of Augusta, and deceased in 1824, aged twenty-six. Another son, Alfred G. Lithgow, resides at Dresden. Judge Lithgow died at George town, December 20, 1798, aged about eighty-three years. Gen. William Lithgow, Jr., the most distinguished of Judge Lithgow's sons, received a good academic education, and studied law with James Sullivan at Biddefo'rd. During the Revolution he entered the army as major of a Massachusetts regiment, and was wounded in the right arm on the retreat from Ticondcroga in 1777, for which he received a pension. He was at the surrender of Bur goyne, and his likeness is in Trumbull's painting of that event which hangs in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington. As an incident of the times it may be mentioned that he petitioned the General Assembly of Massachusetts, in 1779, for permission to pur chase certain confiscated law books, stating his services and suf ferings in the army as an inducement for granting the favor. A resolve was passed authorizing the \"committee of sequestration \" to deliver him \"Bacon's Abridgment, Blackstone's Commentaries and Lilly's Entries, he paying for the same what they may be appraised at by persons appointed by said committee for that pur pose.\"1 After the war he commenced the practice of law at fownalborough, and was commissioned major general in the militia in 1787. He removed to the Fort Western settlement, in Hallowed, in 1788, and opened an office in the southwest room of the old fort, and hired with Dr. Colman Col. Henry Sewall's house when Sewall left in that year for New York. He was the first lawyer who established himself north of Powiialborough.

Lithgow was esteemed a good lawyer; he was eloquent and forcible in his forensic efforts, and \"was remarkable for his noble figure, manly beauty and accomplished manners.\" He died of disease of the liver Feb ruary 16, 1796, at the age of forty-six. At the time of his death he was engaged to be married to Mary Deering of Portland, who afterwards became the wife of Commodore Preble. Arthur Lithgow, the youngest son of the Judge, in his early days engaged in trade at Winslow. When Kennebec county was organized, in 1799, he was appointed sheriff of the county and removed to Augusta. He continued to hold that office, which was very lucrative, until 1809, when Gen. John Chandler superseded him. It was during his continuance in the office of sheriff that the troubles with the settlers on the Kennebec occurred, and Major- General Sewall upon his requisition, on one occasion, called out four hundred of the militia to quell what he regarded an insurrec tion against the laws. This unauthorized act lost him the favor of the executive, with whom he did not agree in politics, and he was removed from office. When he first removed to Augusta he lived in the Thomas Sewall house near the foundry, now owned by Allen Lambard. Afterwards he built the mansion house of the late Reuel Williams, where he resided until after the loss of his office, when he removed to a farm on the road to Winthrop, where he lived a number of years. He afterwards removed to Boston, and was appointed to the office of weigher and measurer in the Custom House, which he held for many years, and from which he was removed on account of his politics, in 1829. He was a colonel in the militia of Maine, a popular sheriff, portly in person, gallant in appearance, hospita ble and generous and with favorable opportunities failed to accu mulate property. He married Martha Bridge, daughter of Edmund Bridge of Pownalborough, by whom he had six children. 1. Arthur, born December 25, 1789, was a shipmaster for some years, and now resides abroad. 2.

He was of the sixth generation in lineal descent from Henry Sewall the common ancestor of all the Sewalls in New England, who emigrated from Great Britain to America and set tled in Rowley, Mass., in 1634. Henry's father, at York, lived upon a small farm and pursued the mechanical occupation of a \"mason.\" With him he passed his minority in laboring on the farm and acquiring his father's trade. On the breaking out of the Revolution, at the age of twenty-three years, he enlisted as a soldier in a company raised at Falmouth, (now Portland,) which in May, 1775, soon after the battle of Lexington, marched to Cambridge and joined Col. Phinney's regiment of the Massachu setts line. In the course of three or four campaigns he passed through the various subordinate grades to that of captain, which rank he sustained to the end of the war. He was in the battle of Hubbardston on the retreat from Ticonderoga, and in one of the skirmishes previous to the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, of which event he was a witness. When the northern troops were ordered south, after this victory, he went with them to Pennsyl vania and joined the main army under Gen. Washington at White Marsh, near Philadelphia, in November following. He wintered at Valley Forge in 1778, and served the remainder of the war in New Jersey aud the highlands of New York.

He then returned to Hallowed and was chosen town clerk, which office he held in that town and Augusta for thirty-five years, during which time he was for several years one of the selectmen. He was appointed by his kinsman, Judge David Sewall, clerk of the District Court of Maine at its organization in 1789, and held that office for twenty-nine years, until he resigned in 1818 with the judge who appointed him. At the organization of Kennebec county in 1799, he was chosen register of deeds, and held that office for seventeen years, until he was succeeded in 1816 by John Hovey. He held in succession the commissions of Division Inspector, Brigadier and Major-General of the Eighth Division of the militia, comprising the counties of Lincoln, Kennebec and Somerset for thirty years, and resigned his military office to William King, the first governor of Maine, upon a new organization of the militia. \"He was one of the church formed at Hallowed \u2014 south parish over which the Rev.

Henry Sewall you can't cheat me.\" They embraced, and the aged soldiers wept. Sewall kept a diary for many years in which are briefly entered notices of events and business and family matters. This, includ ing dates from 1784 to 1820, came into the writer's hands and has been used in preparing this history. Gen.

The church recovering from the paralysis of its early dissensions be came united, to be again divided, this time separating into two organizations, conforming to the limits of newly erected parishes supporting settled ministers. At each village \u2014 Fort and Hook \u2014 a post-office was established, a weekly mail delivered and a newspaper published. At the Hook an academy was instituted and endowed ; a meeting-house built ; a wharf constructed ; a flour mill, distillery and brewery put in operation. At the Fort a term of the Supreme Judicial Court was holden ; a jail erected ; a bridge authorized across the river ; and some large vessels built. The surrounding country was fast set tling ; new towns were incorporated ; and Hallowed became the center of a flourishing trade where merchandise was sold in large amounts, and to some extent by the package. Its lumber and fish trade and navigation were increasing, and enterprising citizens were added to the Fort and Hook, which became competing and rival villages. The annual meeting this year was, for the first time, held in the court house, which being the most convenient continued to be the usual place of meeting for many years. The selectmen were ap pointed a committee to procure preaching, for which \u00a350 were raised, also \u00a3100 for schools, \u00a3300 for highways and \u00a3150 for \" necessary town charges.\" The treasurer was directed \"to loan the paper money in the treasury,\" which probably could be used in no other way. James Bridge was chosen town agent, to which office he was elected for four consecutive years, when he was suc ceeded by Amos Stoddard of the Hook, who retained the office for the two years preceding the incorporation of Augusta. Charles Vaughan this year gave to the town half an acre of land \"back of the house lots laid out on the river\" at the Hook, for a"], [260, "230 Separation again. \u2014 Circular Issued. 1791. burying-ground and for \"setting a meeting-house, when it may be found necessary to build one in the neighborhood.\" The subject of separation, after briefly slumbering, was again agitated with renewed vigor and a determined purpose to sever the connection with Massachusetts. This time the movement was initiated by the senators and representatives of the district in the General Court, who assembled in convention in Boston, and having appointed John Gardiner of Pownalborough chairman dis cussed the question, and on the twenty-second day of February \" resolved by a majority of nearly four to one that the sense of the district ought now to be taken.\" Mr. Gardiner was then re quested to move the next day in the House of Representatives that the petition of the Portland convention preferred to the Leg islature in 1786, and then upon the files of the House, \" be taken up and so far acted on as to obtain an order\" for the considera tion and determination by the several towns and plantations of the propriety and expediency of separation, and for ascertaining if they would institute the proper proceedings for that purpose. The chairman accordingly brought the subject to the notice of the House, and upon a time being assigned for its consideration a debate arose developing a strong opposition, \"principally from the Boston seat whose united force was collected to oppose \" the measure. \" The members of that seat pretended that the petition of the Portland convention did not speak the sentiments of the district;\" to which it was replied \"that the truth of the fact would be undeniably ascertained if the motion prevailed ;\" and that it was \"very singular and hard indeed\" that so respectable a part of the whole community should be denied the action asked. However, the further consideration at the time being pressed aside by other business, the motion was not further urged. A circular was now issued to the towns and plantations in the district, reciting the action thus far taken and setting forth anew the reasons for separation, among which was the financial con sideration, ascertained by computation and estimate, that the district would come off out of debt and with a tenth of the public lands ;. that the tax paid to Massachusetts, no part of which was expended in Maine, would be sufficient to support a government, more particularly as the tax was about to be largely increased by a new valuation ; that the population was nearly double that of Rhode Island or Delaware, and equal to the whites in Georgia, and"], [261, "1791.

They concluded with a request for action at the meetings for choice of representative upon \"the propriety of petitioning the General Court at their next session for their consent \" to separation; and those having a right to representation were \"earnestly requested to send \" rep resentatives \"to the next General Court,\" as full representation \"will command attention and respect,\" and \"will add weight and dignity to our district.\" ' This request was so far regarded by the selectmen of Hallowed as to cause an article to be inserted in the warrant for the meet ing held May 2d for the choice of a representative, to see if the town would take the requisite steps towards \"separation and in dependence.\" The first action taken at this meeting was upon a motion to send a representative to the General Court, which was carried, forty one being in favor and thirty-eight against. A reconsideration, however, of the vote was moved which prevailed, and \"the house was again polled\" upon the question of sending a representative, \"when there appeared twenty for and forty against\" it. The meeting was then dissolved and a meeting organized for the trans action of town business. Here the question of separation again came up, and Joseph North, William Lithgow, Jr., Daniel Cony, Nathaniel Dummer and Henry Sewall were chosen a committee to \"take the subject into consideration\" and report at the next meet ing. The next meeting was held May 13, having been called upon the request of twenty-six freeholders who were dissatisfied with the result of the former meeting, for the reason \"that the town had once decided to send a representative to the General Court and when some of the voters had withdrawn this was reconsidered,\" and the petitioners \"do not conceive it the sense of this town to be excluded from so great and important privilege.\" The signers of this request to the selectmen were mostly resident at the Hook, none dwelling immediately at the fort village. Upon assembling, the meeting decided to elect a representative by a vote of fifty-two to forty-six. Daniel Cony was then chosen, \"Original request or petition.

The committee on the subject of separation then submitted their re port, which is in the hand writing of Gen. William Lithgow, Jr., and was probably drawn up by him. It declares that \" separation ought to take place as soon as conveniently may be, but as the sentiments of the people on a subject of so much importance can be better collected in a district convention to be formed of dele gates from the several towns and plantations than in any other way,\" they recommend that the senators of the county of Lincoln be requested, and the representative of this town be instructed, \"to use their best endeavors that such a convention may be authorized by Legislative act,\" with power, if they shall judge separation expedient, to form a constitution to be submitted to the district for its approval.1 This report was accepted upon \" polling the house \" by a vote of fifty to twenty. In accordance with an existing law twelve persons, ten of whom had families, were warned by a warrant from the selectmen during the year to depart from the town, \"not having obtained the town's consent \" to remain. One of them was Edmund Fortis of the State of Virginia, a black man, who removed to Vassal borough, and was afterwards tried and executed for murder. The Rev. Thurston Whiting preached in the meeting-house January 16th, and it was noted that many strangers who were in town in attendance upon the court then in session were present. The next Sabbath Rev. Eliphalet Smith preached at the Hook. This is the first account we have of preaching at the Hook, which was doubtless in a private house where meetings must have been previously held. Gen. Sewall attended and invited Mr. Smith to preach in the meeting-house. He accepted, and the next Sunday held services, but on account of the inclement weather the ser vices were held in the court house, which \"was more convenient in stormy weather than the meeting-house, as it would admit of fire.\" He again preached in February and March. On the fifteenth of the latter month the members of the Chester church met at Gen. Sewall's house, \"and for reasons then and there maturely considered agreed to alter the name of said church and call it A Congregational Church of Christ in Hallowed.\" Dea con Cony, Jonathan Davenport and Samuel Badcock were then admitted members.\" ' Original Report, 2 Sewall's Diary."], [263, "1791.

Sewall, who as selectman was one of the commit tee to procure preaching, started for \"the westward\" for a minis ter. On the seventh of the month he visited the Rev. Samuel Spring of Newburyport, to consult him, and was advised to call upon the Rev. Nathaniel Emmons of Franklin. On his way thither he fell in with the Rev. Adoniram Judson at a tavern in Dedhani* who accompanied him several miles on the road. When Sewall arrived at Mr. Emmons', Mr. Judson who \"had been prevented by some providential circumstances in his route to Long Island called,\" and was engaged to come to Hallowell as a candidate. He arrived the last of June, and officiated for the first time July third. Aster a lecture Saturday, July 30, preparatory to the sac rament, a church meeting was held. The members of the \" old Hallowell church met also, but were not disposed to unite\" with the new church, On the next day the- sacrament was administered by Mr. Judson to the members of the \" new Hallowell church,\" but none of the members of the \" old church\" except Mrs. Bullen partook with them. Mr. Judson continued to officiate in the town until August 8th, when his connection as a candidate for settlement ended and he departed for Massachusetts. A petition was presented this year by a number of individuals to the General Court for the incorporation and endowment of an academy at \"Hallowell Hook.\" In this petition it was stated that there was not a public school between Exeter, N. H. and the east ern boundary of the United States, a tract of three hundred miles in width, containing a population of one hundred thousand, many of whom would be benefited by having an institution of the kind in the center of the district, and that the advantage arising from the institution would be felt by the commonwealth at large in the increased encouragement given to the settlement and the enhanced value of the public lands in the neighborhood.1 Daniel Cony, who was representative for the town at this time, promoted by active efforts the object of the petition, which was favorably regarded by the General Court, and an act of incorpora tion passed March 5, 1791, establishing the Hallowell academy.'

Gen. Sewall had purchased a ton of hay of David Wade, who lived on the State House lot. He desired to put it into his barn near the ferry-way on the east side of the river, and employed Mr. Kennady to take it to the landing near the \"mile rock,\" where it was received into Col. North's scow and brought up to Sewall's landing; from thence by the assistance of \"Col. Howard's team and man he was enabled to get it into his barn in the evening.\"2 A casualty occurred this year which caused the town some in convenience. David Jackson, who was collector of taxes, in going to Boston was lost with the vessel in which he took passage, on the 18th of November, and his uncollected tax bills, in relation to which there was great confusion and uncertainty, were committed to Jason Livermore to be collected. The weather was unusually mild, with a \"considerable body of snow \" on the ground in December. The river did not close till the tenth of that month, and as late as the twenty-fourth a team of oxen broke through the ice in an attempt to cross at the ferry way. On the last day of the year the ice was unsafe in many places, a large space being at that time open over the channel at the crossing, which was avoided by making \" a circuit as low down as John Brooks' \" dwelling-house.3 This was a small house on the bank of the river nearly in front of William A. Brooks' house on Arsenal street, and had been previously occupied by Capt. Nathan Weston when he removed from the Hook village in 1781, and in it Judge Nathan Weston, his eldest son, was born. The establishment of a college in Maine was a subject of con sideration as early as 1788. It was then proposed \" from grateful ' Sewall's Diary. 2 Ib. Aug. 5th. 3 Sewall's Diary."], [265, "1791. A College in Maine. 235 recollections of the character and merits of John Winthrop\" that it should take the name of Winthrop College, and that it should be endowed with a number of townships of land, and that a large committee of gentlemen from the eastern counties should be selected to locate it. However, nothing was then done. The next year a movement was commenced in Portland, an account of which is concisely given in a letter from the Rev. Samuel Deane to Dr. Daniel Cony, dated \" Portland, December 17, 1791.\" He says, \" The history of the affair of the intended col lege is as follows : In the fall of the year 1789 the magistrates of this county sent a petition to the Honorable General Court praying for the grant of a college in and for the county of Cum berland and that they would endow it with the grant of some of the unlocated lands in the District of Maine. The clergy of the county at the same time jointly petitioned the Honorable Court for the same favor. The Hon. Joseph Thatcher was entrusted with the presentation of the petitions. He did it, and leave was granted to bring in a bill for the purpose. \" Mr. Thatcher last January presented the bill he had prepared, in which Gorham was named as the place of the college, five town ships of land as the endowment, and a number of trustees consist ing of gentlemen in the three counties of York, Cumberland and Lincoln. The bill was first presented to the Honorable Senate, who passed it ; but the House postponed the consideration of it till the approaching summer session, soon after which postpone ment the Rev. Mr. Johnson of Freeport solicited conditional sub scriptions in his vicinity in favor of erecting the college in Free port, the amount of which subscription as he saith is no less than \u00a31300. When the people of Portland were informed of this sub scription, and not approving of that town as the place of the col lege, they began a subscription of a similar nature in favor of Portland, which now amounts to about \u00a31200 and is expected to increase, a considerable part of which is in cash, and I think none have subscribed who are not able and willing to contribute accord ing to their promise. This is not believed to be the case with the subscribers in and about Freeport. Before the last summer ses sion of the General Court, the Portland subscribers petitioned the court to place the college in Portland. The Honorable House, as I have heard, recommended it to the eastern members of ye court to meet and agree upon a place. They accordingly met and could"], [266, "1791. A College in Maine. 236 not agree, but requested the House to pass the amended bill, leav ing a blank for the place. The House did so, and the Senate non concurred, meaning to take it up next January. Thus far the matter has proceeded.\" l Dr. Deane then entered into a consideration of the reasons which should induce the establishment of the college in Portland, among which is the ability of the people in the vicinity \" to do something towards building and endowing a college.\" He said that Portland was centrally situated and easy of access from other parts of the county of Cumberland ; that seminaries of learning \"ought to be, ever have been, and ever must be in populous places.\" \"The more populous the place of a seat of learning is the more good examples it is to be hoped will be seen by the stu dents.\" The further consideration was suggested of favorably \"obtaining provisions,\" as \"most of the kinds which will be needed are at least one-fourth part cheaper than they could be got in any other town in the county, as Portland has already be come a considerable market town.\" The place selected for the site of the college buildings was Bramhall's Hill, apd Cony was asked to use his influence at court to further their petition. But nothing was accomplished in rela tion to a college until a few years after, when Cony, still a repre sentative, acted under instructions from the town he represented, which is noticed in its appropriate place. The Rev. Daniel Little of Wells while on a missionary tour through the \"Eastern country,\" in the summer of this year, stopped with Dr. Cony, who then lived in the \"Tobey House\" below the hospital. In mentioning the fact in a letter addressed to the Rev. Peter Thatcher, the doctor gave an account of the creature comforts provided for his reverend guest, which were doubtless considered luxurious living, and were at least the best in kind and greatest in variety which the country then afforded. He says, \"We gave Father Little fine strawberries and milk, smoked salmon, smoked herring, baked beans, stewed peas, roasted potatoes, spruce beer, &c, &c, and Mr. Little, agree ably to Luke 8th ' eat and drank such things as were set before him.'\"2 ' Samuel Deane's MS. letter to Daniel Cony, December 17, 1791. 2 Letter dated June 20, 1791."], [267, "1792.

It prohibited the placing of \" lumber, timber and firewood\" within the limits of any highway \"which is not more than two rods wide,\" under a penalty of ten shillings forfeit to the use of the poor of the town. Doctor Cony was chosen representative May 7th by fifty-three votes over his competitor James Bridge, who had forty-one. But Cony having been chosen senator, an election was held in Sep tember, when the vacancy was filled by the election of Nathan iel Dummer, who was the first representative elected from the Hook. The convention which the town of Hallowell proposed to have called to ascertain the sentiments of the district on the subject of separation and to form a constitution, does not seem to have met the approval of the Legislature, which authorized by a resolve, March 6th, the sense of the district to be taken in town meetings to be called for that purpose. In anticipation of the meeting in Hallowell, Thomas Rice and John Gardiner of Pownalborough wrote the selectmen that the \"golden opportunity\" offered by the resolve \"ought to be seized with avidity,\" and urged upon them in warm terms to \" declare for separation.\" x The town held its meeting on the first Monday in May, when the close vote of fifty-six for and fifty-two against separation was polled. Eleven other persons, inhabitants of the district but not of the town, being present were permitted to vote, and \"severally declared themselves to be for separation.\" The result of the ballot in the district made this movement as unsuccessful as the former. But the subject of separation came again before the town in November of the next year, when it assembled to consider a letter from \" a committee of the district\" and to choose a dele gate to a convention to be held at Portland the following Decem- 1 Original letter, dated March 31, 1792."], [268, "1792. 238 A Church Council. \u2014 Union of Churches. ber.

David Smith, a young candidate from Ipswich, who arrived June 27th, boarded at Gen. Sewall's and engaged to preach three months, at the expiration of which time he was in vited by a town meeting to remain and preach for seven months \"upon probation;\" but as he officiated for the last time Septem ber 30th he probably declined the invitation. In October the two churches, \" A Congregational Church of Christ in Hallowell,\" and the \"Old Hallowell Church,\" held church meetings in the meeting-house, and \"a conference en sued\" respecting a union, but \"nothing was concluded upon except to send for a council of three churches.\" These churches were \"Dr. Hemmingway's, Mr. Little's and Mr. Gilman's.\" This council arrived, and met in the court house on the seven teenth of the next January, when the two churches appeared before them, and by their advice consented to pass over other matters and let the council draw \" articles of faith to be signed by both if agreeable.\" The articles were drawn up the next day and \"made agreeable to both churches.\" But the Church of Christ \" had weighty objections, nevertheless, to several members of the other church on account of doctrines and moral character.\" This being manifest, they \"cleared the house of spectators and dealt closely with the\" erring members, \"upon which they ap peared to give some degree of satisfaction,\" when the doubting church, \" being brought to a great strait,\" at length concluded to join the other church on the condition \" that whenever the major part of its members shall request to be dismissed, in a church capacity, the members of the other church shall grant it.\" This 1 Sewall's Diary. 2 Reuel Williams."], [269, "1792.

By this list the new names added since 1790 were thirty two.2 This list shows the progress made by the town since the former and first \"inquiry\" in 1784. The polls had increased to two hun dred and seventy-seven, of which forty-one were over sixteen and under twenty-one years, and eighteen were not ratable. The popu lation had probably increased in the same ratio, as it was found by the census taken two years previous to be one thousand one hun dred and ninety-four. The dwelling houses returned were but thirty-six, two less than in 1784. The shops in or adjoining dwell ing houses, were seven ; all other shops twenty-two ; barns fifty eight; and, probably to compensate for a deficiency in the number of dwelling houses and barns, \"all other buildings of \u00a35 value and upwards\" were swelled to the large number of one hundred and twenty-two. The valuation committee of the General Court, however, doomed the town by adding one hundred to the dwelling houses and thirty to the barns, and reduced the small buildings, of five pounds' value and upwards, to twenty.3 The personal property had considerably increased. Horses num bered seventy-seven, oxen two hundred and fifteen, \"cows and steers three years old and upwards,\" three hundred and twenty eight. Stock in trade amounted to \u00a35318; tons of vessels five hundred and eighty-three ; tan-houses four ; grist-mills two ; saw mills five ; slaughter-houses two, and one bake-house.

Gen. Sewall set out for Wiscasset March 5th to attend the District Court. He proceeded to Cobbossee and dined at Gen. Dearborn's with Gen. Lithgow and Col. North. After dinner they started in company, but Sewall parted with them at Maj. Colburn's and \" went by the way of Dudley's mills.\" He missed his way in the woods and \"went round by Choat's mills in Balltown,\" \u2014 now Jefferson. He \"reached the head of the tide notwithstanding and put up at Carlton's,\" and arrived at Wiscasset at twelve o'clock the next day. Having occasion to go to Boston the next May, Sewall started \"with Gen. Lithgow in a canoe aud got on board of\" the vessel sailed by \" Capt. Pattee at the sands,\" and duly reached Boston. The fourth of July waj celebrated this year by a number of gentlemen, who had \"a dinner prepared\" at Thomas' inn. Sewall attended with Mr. Smith the minister, who boarded with him, but they \" retired before the scene assumed much of the dangers incident to excess.\" A meeting of the trustees of Hallowell academy was held the twenty-sixth day of July at Pownalborough, probably with a view to the erection of au academy building ; for in May of the next year William Brooks went with Gen.

Page's regiment with Maj. Col burn's troop of horse were inspected. One of those casualties happened at the fort settlement on the thirty-first of May which are of too frequent occurrence even at the present day. As some men were firing a cannon in front of the meeting-house at eight o'clock in the evening, probably on account of some recent news from France, William Vose and James and Samuel Johnson \" were wounded by an unexpected discharge, by reason of the cannon not being properly swabbed.\" The two Johnsons were thought to be mortally wounded, and were carried to Elias Craig's house, in whose family James John son resided.

She went over to Mr. Craig's and dressed the wounds of the sufferers, and the next day Samuel was carried on a bier borne by four men to Mr. Child's, where he was properly cared for. Theophilus Hamlen's house on Dickman court was raised July 23d, and was the occasion of a dance in the evening.1 On the tenth of August the people at the Hook were much alarmed by fire in the woods back of the village, and sent to the Fort for help to prevent their buildings being burned. Again, in October, the small pox, which was a more alarming disease then than at present, broke out among them and Mr. Sweet and two of his children died with it. The French Revolution had been in progress since 1789, and was arousing strong feelings of sympathy in America, which gave rise to public demonstrations by \"civic feasts\" expressive of joy at its success. At Hallowell, March eleventh, 1793 \u2014 the anniversary of the inauguration of Washington as president, \u2014 the success of the French was celebrated by a public dinner in the court house, at which sixty persons sat down under the folds of a tri-colored flag which floated from its staff upon the building. After dinner fifteen regular toasts were drank accompanied by the discharge of cannon. In the evening the houses in the neighborhood were illuminated, \"several sky-rockets\" were thrown up, and upon the ice in the middle of the river opposite the fort was raised a triangular transparency on which appeared in large letters \"France, Liberty, Equality.\"2 The day ended with the usual hilarity attendant upon such occasions. At this time pleasure carriages just began to make their appear ance, but the condition of the roads was such that little use could bo made of them. Judge North and William Brooks had each a chaise about this time which were the only ones in town. Others, however, soon appeared. Thomas Bond had one and John Soule had one. Gen. Sewall records July 5, 1798, \" Procured Mr. Soule's chaise, put in our horse, and carried Mrs. Sewall to meeting at the Hook ; came home at noon. Went again P.

Lot Hamlen painted it and covered the mouldings with silver leaf.1 Gen. Sewall, who usually performed his journeys on horseback in winter as well as summer, furnished himself with the luxury of a sleigh at this time \u2014 1793 \u2014 on which he painted his \"family arms,\" and had a covered top put to it by Mr. Hamlen. A few days after he records a visit to \"Mr. Cony's with our new topped sleigh.\" 2 The roads were so bad at this time that accidents occasionally oc curred to riders by their horses falling. In April of this year, as Ephraim Ballard and his wife were returning from meeting, riding on the same horse after the manner of the time, the horse fell near the Kennady brook and threw them \" into a doleful gully,\" but Mrs. Ballard relates \u2014 regardless of herself \u2014 that \"Mr. Ballard cleared himself of the horse,\" and we \"were not much hurt.\" 3 Gen. Lithgow at this time being out of health removed to his father's in Georgetown leaving James Bridge the only lawyer in town. Mr. Bridge brought an action before a magistrate against Gen. Sewall, who went to Wiscasset for the sole purpose of em ploying Silas Lee to come to Hallowell to defend it. While private litigation was occupying the attention of some of the citi zens, public emergency of a warlike nature was provided for by raising thirty pounds \"to procure the town stock of warlike stores required by law.\" * Vaughan's flour mill at the Hook was probably completed this year. On the 30th of October Sewall purchased a barrel of flour of the miller, which was to be paid for when he ascertained the price. At this time the Fort, which had been and still was the leading village in town, began to be viewed with jealousy by its enterpris ing rival at the Hook. At the annual meeting, which assembled at the court-house, of which Col. North was moderator, \"a violent attempt\" was made by \"the people at the Hook to remove the office of town clerk to that neighborhood,\" in which they were defeated by the re-election of Henry Sewall to that office \"by a 3 Mrs. Ballard's Diary. 4 Town Records.

An increase of the usual sums was voted for schools and high ways, but an article relating to \"procuring preaching\" was dis missed, probably with a view to the action which was taken at a subsequent meeting, when \u00a360 were raised for that purpose, and it was voted \"that one-third part\" of the preaching \"be per formed in the academy at the Hook.\" This was the first appro priation of money by the town for support of public worship at that place. The division of the town into two parishes \u2014 an important meas ure looking to a severance of ecclesiastical from town affairs \u2014 came before the May meeting on application of James Carr and thirteen other residents at the Hook, when a committee of nine was chosen to consider the subject and report at the next annual meeting.2 The care of the town for education was manifested by the choice of a committee consisting of Daniel Cony, Nathaniel Dummer, Joseph North, Henry Sewall and William Brooks, \"to visit and inspect schools.\" Notwithstanding the local feeling manifested at the annual meet ing, Nathaniel Dummer of the Hook was unanimously chosen representative this year. The committee to procure preaching engaged the services of the Rev. Charles Turner in July, at four and a half dollars a sabbath, and Dr. Cony engaged to board him and keep his horse for twelve shillings per week. He continued to preach in town until the last of the following March, \"performing\" a third of the time at the Hook. The meeting-house was erected partly in an eight rod rangew'ay, now Market square, in 1782, before the same was laid out as a road, and before Water street was laid out. It was not finished for many years. The annual town meeting in April 1783 was called at the meeting-house, where it assembled but immediately ' Sewall's Diary. 2 The committee consisted of Nathaniel Dummer, Joseph North, Beriah Ingraham, James Page, Joseph Smith, Samuel Bullen, Henry Sewall, William Howard and Brian Fetcher."], [277, "1793.

During the two years and a half when Isaac Foster held services in the house it was unfinished, without gallery or pews or even plaster ing, and so remained until a few days before the ordination of Rev.

The house was thirty-six by fifty feet, aud twenty-one feet posts. On each side of the pulpit, which was ascended by a flight of nine steps, were blocks of seven pews, end to the wall, and on each of the other sides of the building a tier of pews lengthwise with the walls, which were raised one step above the floor, in the area of which were two blocks often pews each, divided by a broad aisle. In front of these, and immediately in front of the pulpit, were four long benches for free seats, two marked \"men's seats\" and two \"women's seats.\" The pews were numbered from one to forty-six, and were valued according to their numbers, from eight pounds to two pounds ten shillings. The building was entered"], [278, "1793. 248 First Jail. \u2014 Movement for Parishes. through a two-story \"porch\" ten or twelve feet square, in which ascended two flights of stairs to the gallery, where were a few pews valued at \u00a31 10s. each; but the larger part of the gallery had free seats.1 This house cost the town \u00a3283, 10s. 7d. besides the subscription for glazing and the inside finish, which were paid for by the sale of pews. In 1781 tax bills to the amount of \u00a3150 were commit ted to Jonas Clark and Ephraim Ballard for assessments for the meeting-house, and in 1783 Jonas Clark aud Asa Emerson had bills for the same purpose, for \u00a390. These bills were not finally settled and the balance provided for by the town until January 1789. The largest bill of work upon the building was \u00a365, paid to \"Nathaniel Hamblin\" in 1784 and '85. The county of Lincoln, as extensive as it was, had till this time been accommodated for a jail with a block-house in the \"parade ground\" of old Fort Shirley at Pownalborough.2 But, February 12th of this year, a committee of the sessions met at Col. North's for the purpose of receiving proposals for timber and contracting for the erection of one in Hallowell.3 During the season a jail with walls of hewn timber was erected on the site afterwards occupied by the old stone jail. It was two stories high and not very secure; small apertures were cut in the walls to admit light and air to the cells. Through one of these a man from Winthrop by the name of Carter, who was confined for stealing a watch, once escaped. He enlarged the opening with a jack-knife, and then stripped naked, but so tight was the squeeze to effect an exit that some of his skin was left on the timber sides of the opening. He was not heard from afterwards.4 As the question of dividing the town into two parishes was to come before the annual meeting this year, the principal inhabi tants in the northern part of the town, west of the river, petitioned the selectmen to insert an article in the warrant to see if the town would consent to set off the northerly third part \" to be a distinct and separate parish,\" in which they say, \"considering our dis tance from the public meeting-house and the difficulty of passing the roads leading to the same, it makes it very difficult for us, and almost impossible for many of our families to attend public worship.\" 'Original plan accepted Nov. 2, 1792, 2 Ante. 3 Sewall's Diary. 4 Nathaniel Robinson."], [279, "1794.

This line, which came to the State lot on the west side and the Hospital lot on the east, was thought to be adverse to the interests of the Fort settlement, and \" a lengthy discus sion arose, which continued till near dark,\" when \"no decision being had,\" Daniel Cony, \"the moderator, adjourned the meeting\" to the day but one following, when the report was further dis cussed and amended by providing that the inhabitants may choose which parish they will worship and pay rates in.

This, however, was reconsidered, and the report further amended providing for a division of the town into three parishes, when it was accepted without opposition, and Nathaniel Dummer, Elias Craig and Matthew Hay ward were chosen to petition the legislature to divide the town in accordance with the vote into three parishes. At the close of the meeting which ended the lengthy and warm discussion, a vote of thanks was \"presented to Daniel Cony for his impartial services as moderator.\" Political parties, which had heretofore divided upon the powers conferred on the Federal Government, were now strongly arrayed on its foreign policy in reference to measures growing out of the French Revolution. The republicans had strong sympathy with the French revolutionists, and desired their triumphant success, while their opponents, the federalists, representing chiefly the com mercial class, could see in the revolution nothing but disorders big with crime, and were in feeling opposed to it. The gubernatorial nominations were made this year with reference to party considera tions. Samuel Adams was the republican candidate, and William Cushing late Chief Justice, the federal candidate. The celebration at Hallowed, in March of the previous year, indicated the senti ments of the town to be strongly republican, and when the time came to vote for governor they proved unanimously so.

To the Hon.

Impressed with the melancholy truth that in the infancy of States the means of information are too often neglected, though absolutely necessary to their security and happiness, your constitnents are solicitous to promote a wakeful vigilance, so that when, in due time, this district shall become a member of the Union, such a Constitution and code of by-laws as will secure them the blessings of liberty and transmit them unimpaired to posterity, may be the result of enlightened policy and virtue. The destitution of which has caused many governments to originate in fraud and violence, and to derive their sup port from no better means. When once established they become inveterate, and baffle all the efforts of radical reform ; and hence the great and invincible necessity of revolutions, so fatal and so much to be dreaded by the citizens of a free government. To provide against these possible evils by a more general diffusion of know edge among the people, and to cherish the growth of moral and religious sen timents, you are instructed to exert your ability in the acquisition of a college, and of such an endowment of it as the wisdom of the Legislature shall think proper to grant.

Under this appropriation the first framed bridge over that brook was raised by Mr. Hamlen, October 2d, but the sum was not suffi cient to complete it, and the town the next February raised \u00a330 for that purpose, aster having adjourned the meeting to examine the unfinished structure. In conformity with the petition for that purpose, the legislature June 14th, incorporated three parishes in the town, North, Middle and South. The dividing line between the South and Middle parish was the present south line of Augusta ; and between the Middle and North parish the north lines of lot number eighteen ou the west side of the river, and number thirty-four on the east. In anticipation of this division the town, at the May meeting, raised \u00a350 for preaching, to be apportioned to each parish in proportion to the amount of the assessments paid by each ; and a committee was chosen for each parish to-procure preaching. The committee for the South parish was Obadiah Harris, Moses Sewall and Nathaniel Dummer; for the Middle parish James Bridge, William Howard and Elias Craig; for the North parish Matthew Hayward, Beriah Ingraham and Brian Fletcher. The \"united church\" had found it necessary during the past year to put some of its members, who were formerl}' members of the \"old church,\" under discipline on account of doctrine and un becoming conduct ; which discipline was continued when, at an adjourned meeting held June 26th, \"the church, formerly called the Chester church, separated from the other church according to express stipulation made at the time of junction.\" The Middle parish in June engaged the Rev. Charles Turner to preach \"for the season\" in the meeting-house; and in the South parish the Rev. Eliphalet Gillet, from New Gloucester, preached for the first time August 3d, in the academy at the Hook, where ' Sewall's Diary. 8 Ib."], [282, "Supreme Judicial Court. 1794. 252 we find him in October \"preaching on probation for settlement.\" On the twenty-fifth of November Sewall went to the Hook, where he says, \" our church convened eight members and admitted two more, which made ten, all males, and then proceeded to give Mr. Gillet a call to settle. The parish had a meeting the same day and concurred with the church in this important matter.\" In the Middle parish the Rev. Daniel Stone preached for the first time November 9th, and on the sixteenth of the next February the parish gave him a call to settle. The term of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts which had been holden in the month of June, at Pownalborough, was by law directed to be held alternately at Wiscasset and Hallowell. The first term of this court at Hallowell commenced July 8th of this year in the meeting-house which was prepared for its accom modation, the court-house not being sufficiently large. It was held by Judges Paine, Sumner and Dawes. \"They were accom panied by some of the most distinguished jurists of the day ; among whom, besides Sullivan the Attornej7 General, were The ophilus Parsons and Nathan Dane, attended by three sheriffs, in their cocked hats, girt with swords, each with his long white staff of office.\" It was an important event which caused \"the elite\" of the surrounding country to assemble. Having no bell to sum mon the court, the judges \"moved by beat of drum, in a proces sion not a little imposing, preceded by their officers, and followed by the bar.\" ' The session continued nine days,2 during which an insane person by the name of Richardson, who formerly lived in the family of Jedediah Jewett of Pittston, but then wandered about the country in a happy mood, calling herself and believing that she was the Queen of Sheba, entered the house when the court was in session. \"Her head was uncovered, and her face haggard aud bronzed by exposure. Her eyes were wild, but piercing, beaming with conscious majesty and high command. She advanced rapidly to the Judges' seat and had actually got in among them. The presiding judge alarmed and amazed, called for the interference of the sheriff, while she nothing daunted, insisted that she was only taking her proper place.\" 3 In the summer of this year, Talleyrand, who had entered the French national assembly as Bishop of Autun, was in Hallowed a 1 Judge Weston's Centennial Oration. 2 Sewall's Diary. \"Judge Weston's Rem."], [283, "1794.

During the progress of the French Revolution he was obliged to flee to England, where, it is said, the disclosure of some ministerial secrets, which were suspected to have transpired through his intrigues, caused him to be sent out of the countrjr. He took passage in a ship which landed him at Wiscasset, from whence he passed leisurely on to the seat of government at Phila delphia.1 He came to Hallowell in company with a young French man, and brought a letter, probably from Wiscasset, to Col. North who was absent. His oldest son, however, received him, and Mrs. North thinking it necessary to pay him some attention invited him to dine ; he accepted, and was met at dinner by some ladies whose presence was unexpected to him, and to whom he apolo gized, saying he did not expect to meet ladies. He stopped at the house of \" Billy Pitt,\" who then kept the best tavern in the place.2 At the Hook he stopped with Charles Vaughan and slept in the \" old mill house,\" then occupied by Vaughan, near Bomba hook creek.3 While there he visited Chandler Robbins by invita tion. Mr. Robbins was a Harvard graduate and \"had been the private secretary of John Adams when he was minister at London, and spoke French with fluency and elegance.\" The visit made an impression on Talleyrand. \"Many years afterwards, Judge Robbins, who had been ad vanced to public honors in this part of the country, sent a son abroad to finish his medical education in Paris. It was soon after the restoration of the Bourbons ; Talleyrand was in high favor, and in the most palmy state of his brilliant career. He heard of young Robbins ; and desirous to repay in Paris, civilities received at Hallowed, invited him to dine, placed him at table between two ladies of high rank, and otherwise treated him with marked atten tion.\"4 The companion who accompanied Talleyrand is supposed to have been the young Duke of Orleans, Louis Phillippe, afterwards King of the French.

Seth Williams, by warrant issued by Daniel Cony, a magistrate, to assemble at the meeting-house on the 18th of June for the pur pose of organizing and raising money for \" hiring a teacher of piety, religion and morality, agreeably to the constitution and best interests of society.\"1 At the meeting held under this warrant, Daniel Cony was chosen moderator, Samuel Colman clerk, Henry Sewall, Samuel Colman and Elias Craig assessors, William Howard treasurer, Ephraim Ballard collector, and Wil liam Howard, James Bridge and Elias Craig a committee to \"pro cure preaching,\" for which purpose \u00a345 were raised. We have already noticed that Rev. Charles Turner was engaged to preach for \"the season,\" which was not of long duration, as Rev. Daniel Stone officiated for the first time November 9th of this year, and on the twenty-fourth of the same month the parish directed the committee on preaching to engage him \"to continue three months the ensuing winter,\" before the end of which, on the eleventh of the following February, it was voted to give him a call to settle ; when William Brooks, Joseph North, James Bridge, William Howard and Seth Williams were chosen to con fer with him and \" report what salary and settlement it would be proper to offer\" him. This committee subsequently reported, and the parish voted to give Mr. Stone \" one hundred and twenty pounds by way of settlement immediately after his ordination,\" and \u00a3100 salary for the first year and to increase it five pounds per year for two years, and ten pounds per year for four years longer, when it would amount to \u00a3150, \"which sum should be his established salary ever afterwards.\" 2 This provision for his support was accepted by Mr. Stone, and October twenty-first was fixed for his ordination, at which \"seven churches with their pastors and delegates\" were invited to assist; and the before mentioned committee on salary was appointed to provide for the entertainment of the council at the expense of the parish, for which the sum of sevent}T-five dollars was raised.

Alden Bradford gave the right hand of fellowship.1 In the following February the sermon, charge and right hand of fellowship were published by Peter Edes at the Fort. At this time an element of weakness existed in the parish un favorable to the support of a minister. This was the right which the inhabitants possessed, by the act incorporating the parish, of joining themselves with their families and estates to either of the other two parishes. By certifying their choice to the town clerk in the month of March in each year they were taxed for minis terial purposes only in the parish of their choice. This process of parochial change was afterwards permitted between societies in the same parish, and was called \"polling off.\" As the North parish did not have a place for public worship or a settled minis ter, and its ministerial tax, if any was assessed, was light, some members of the South and Middle changed to the North parish to escape taxation, while others were induced to make the change on account of religious doctrines which then divided the Con gregational clergy and people. Mr. Stone was of the Armenian persuasion while some of his parishioners were high Calvinists. However, his ministrations were generally acquiesced in and were acceptable for a few years, when opposition arose which seriously divided the parish. Dr. Cony early took measures to have a mail established to Hal lowell. When in Portland, probably on his way to the legislature, he presented a petition to be signed for a semi-monthly mail to the Kennebec, but was laughed at for his presumption. It was said government never would send a mail so far through the wilder ness.2 This was probably about 1787, when but one mail a week was received, by post-rider, at Portland. However, Cony wrote to Samuel A. Otis, in the next year, that he was \"pleased to hear that we are to have a post-rider into the county ;\" 3 and to George Thatcher, that \"Congress was half right in making a grant for transporting the mail from Portland to Pownalborough once a fort night,\" and that he should have been \" better pleased had it been extended to Hallowed as requested.\" 4 The mail continued to arrive at Pownalborough once a fortnight 'Ken.

The roads at this time were not suitable for carriages and travelling was on horse back. Gen. Sewall, who had occasion to attend regularly the District Court held at Portland, went from Hallowell and returned till about this time by way of Bath, but in June of the last year he passed for the first time over the new route by way of Mon mouth. By the way of Bath nearly two days were required to reach Portland, while by starting early, so as to breakfast at \"Chandler's in Monmouth,\" Portland was reached early in the forenoon of the following day. The latter route was adopted by government for the mail which it established this year. The postmaster general, Timothy Pickering, under date of Au gust 12, 1 7 04, notified James Burton of Hallowell, (now Augusta,) that \"it being judged proper that a post office should be estab lished at Hallowed court house,\" he tendered to him \"the office of deputy postmaster at that place.\" He also informed him that he would \" receive a further communication from the general post office before the first of next October, when the carriage of the mails on the new post roads is to commence,\" and expressed a hope that \" gentlemen whom their friends have named for trusts so useful to their towns and neighborhoods will not decline them.\"1 Burton's commission 2 authorized him to hold the office during the pleasure of the postmaster general. The mail established at this time was carried once a week, on horseback, by Benjamin Allen and Mathew Blossom, from Port land to Wiscasset. The route was through Gray, New Gloucester. Greene, Monmouth, Winthrop, Hallowell \u2014 Fort and Hook \u2014 Pitts ton, (crossing at Smith's Ferry) and Pownalborough to Wiscasset and back. Blossom brought the mail to Winthrop, whence Allen, who was postmaster at that place, carried it forward.3 James Burton, the postmaster, lived and traded at this time in the \"Eustice or Burton house,\" which stood where Meonian build ing now stands. He kept the post office in the rear end of the shop part of the building.4 Nathaniel Dummer was appointed postmaster at the Hook, and kept the office in his store, which stood near the center of Ken nebec row.

In accepting his proposals for the service, the postmaster general, in a letter to Burton, remarks that they are considered high \"as living must be cheap in your country, but as he will give great satisfaction to the magistrates in the different towns\" he concludes to accept them.1 The publication of the first newspaper printed on the Kennebec, called the \"Eastern Star,\" was commenced August 4th, by How ard S. Robinson, at Hallowell Hook.2 It maintained a feeble exis tence for about a year, when it was succeeded by a newspaper called the Tocsin,3 in which Nathaniel Perley called \" for the last time\" previous to suits upon those who had not settled for the Eastern Star.4 The extreme penalty of the law was inflicted at Pownalborough, in September of this year, upon Edmund Fortis, a negro, who was adjudged guilty of the murder of Pamelia Tilton of Vassalborough.' Upon his trial he pleaded guilty, \"which he meekly declined to retract, manifesting great penitence, and expressing his readiness to submit to the infliction of human justice.'\" Fortis came from Virginia to Hallowell in 1791, and upon being warned to leave the town removed to Vassalborough. A number of persons went from Hallowell to Pownalborough to witness his execution.\" The winter of 1794-5 was remarkably mild. On the 15th of December the river was clear of ice from \"Cobbossee to the sea,\" and on the twenty-first of the same month the ice went out from Fort Western, and the river continued open to the thirty-first, at which time the ground was bare of snow. However, the ice \"became passable\" on the third of January, and snow covered the ground to the depth of a foot the next day.7 On the third of Feb ruary a change came. A damp snow had fallen for two days pre viously, and the wind having changed to the southeast accompani ed with rain, the greatest freshet arose in the Kennebec that had been known since the settlement of the country.8 On the fifth the 1 Letter Joseph Habershan 2 Sewall's Diary. \"Mrs. Ballard's Diary, \"Judge Weston's Cent.

Mrs. Ballard \u2014 who had been confined four days before with her daughter Martha\u2014 and the family were in bed at the time. The water rose suddenly from the ice jamming below, and the in mates barely escaped before the house was removed from its foun dation. Mrs. Ballard with the child was taken with the bed on which they lay, placed in a sleigh, and carried to the house of James Burton, and although she was \"out three or four hours,\" her mother found her the next day as she relates, \" comfortable to admiration.\" This year, at the annual meeting, held March sixteenth, at the meeting-house, Daniel Cony was chosen moderator, and as the meeting was unusually large the selectmen, Nathaniel Dummer, Elias Craig and Mathew Hayward, were appointed to assist him in assorting and counting the votes. Gen. Sewall was, by the un precedented number of two hundred and fifty votes, unanimously chosen clerk. A motion was then submitted and carried by voters from the Hook, to elect five selectmen instead of the usual number of three. This probably was a surprise upon the Fort, which for some cause was opposed to it. An adjournment was immediately had for half an hour, and upon reassembling a debate arose in relation to who were qualified voters, during which an adjourn ment was moved to meet March 23d in the academy at the Hook, which was carried. The Fort and Hook were now arrayed against each other, and took issue on the questions of who were voters, the number of selectmen, and where the town meetings should be held. Each prepared for the struggle which was to take place at the adjourned meeting. An inhabitant of a town at this time \" who should pay in one single tax, besides the poll, a sum equal to two-thirds of a single poll tax,\" was entitled to vote in town affairs, and it became im portant to know who by this rule possessed the right.

The selectmen's list contained one hun dred and eighty-four names, the South parish list eighty-two. On the 23d of March the meeting assembled by adjournment in the academy at the Hook. This was the first and only town meeting held at the Hook during the time Augusta and Hallowell were united. The assessors of the South parish presented their list of voters, which was rejected by the moderator. The record then proceeds, \"The meeting being purged by the moderator, agree able to a list produced by the assessors,\" it was voted, ninety yeas to seventy-one nays, to reconsider the vote to choose five selectmen passed at the meeting of the sixteenth. This was a test vote between the villages, making a plurality of nineteen in favor of the north part of the town ; but as there were but four absent from the north part and eleven from the south, the actual difference if all entitled to vote had been present would have been but twelve.' The meeting then balloted for three selectmen, and elected Mathew Hayward and Elias Craig of the Fort, and Joseph Smith of the Hook.2 The Fort being in a decided majority, the meeting was adjourned to the first Monday in April, to meet at the meeting-house at the Fort; and tradition has it, that the Fort voters proceeded home in martial array, headed by \"Jemmy Black.\" At the adjourned meeting the remaining officers were chosen \"by nomination and hand vote.\" The remaining business of the meeting appears to have been done without division, until at its close it was moved to choose two additional selectmen; this was voted down, sixty-five to thirty-nine.

The academy building which had been erected at the Hook was finished in the spring of this year, aud Tuesday, May 5th, was appointed for opening the institution. On that day nine of the trustees met in the morning and arranged the proceedings for the day. A sermon was delivered in the academy to \"a crowded auditory\" by the Rev. Mr. Bradford of Pownalborough, \" after which the trustees, the clergy and other gentlemen partook of a public dinner provided at Col.

Daniel Cony, twenty-six years after, in 1821, as president of the board of trustees, at an examination of the students, asked, \"What have been the fruits of this insti tution?\" He answered the question by stating that \"more than eleven hundred children and youth of our county have received instruction here,\" many of whom are \"ornaments to society and props to the State.\" Some are \"counsellors and advocates in our courts of justice,\" others \"distinguished for talents and learning are judges in those courts,\" others still \"are physicians, magistrates, officers in our towns, counties and the State, school masters and preceptors of our academies;\" and he \"mentions with sincere satisfaction that some are public teachers of piety, religion and morality.\"2 The church and committee of the South parish having appointed the twelfth day of August for the ordination of the Rev. Eliphalet Gillet, the ordaining council met at the academy, in the morning of that day, \"to hear and consider the objections made by the op position.\" What the grounds of opposition were, and by whom made, we are not informed, but after a hearing of nearly two hours, by a unanimous result, the council proceeded to the ordination. The first prayer was made by the Rev. Ezekiel Emerson ; Dr. Robbins preached the sermon; Rev. Mr. Gilman prayed at the \"laying on of hands;\" Dr. Hemmenway gave the charge; Rev. Mr. Brad ford the right hand of fellowship ; aud Rev. Mr. Anderson made the concluding prayer. The services were concluded before a late dinner, at three o'clock.3 The church at this time had twelve male and six female communicants.4 On the twenty-fourth of the next April, three members from Chester being at the Hook, that branch was separated from the church \"by mutual consent,\" and the Chester element disappeared from the church organization in Hal lowell. 3 Sewall's Diary, ' Tocsin, editorial May 10, 1796.

George Crosby, who had occupied a small store on the east side of the river, near the Fort and \"contiguous to a fine eddy,\" adver tised the same for sale, having removed to the west side, where be built the large wooden building on Water street, above the bridge, which from its great size was called the \" Castle,\" and is known at this day as the \"old Castle.\" He advertised largely in the Intelligencer, sold liquors by the cask, tea by the chest, and Eng lish goods \"just imported by him from Liverpool\" by the package. He ran the \"Kennebec Packet,\" Capt. Samuel Patterson master, between this place and Boston ; built the ship Betsey of three hun dred and seventeen tons ; and by great activity took the lead in business on the west side. Capt. John Gage of Readfield and Peter T. Vose, under the name of Gage & Vose, occupied \"the new store opposite Pollard's tavern.\" This was the yellow store long occupied by the late T. W. Smith, on the site of Smith's block. They kept an extensive and general assortment of goods and books and stationery. Nathan Weston still kept his store at the foot of Court street. It was entered from the bridge crossing the gully, in which were his potash buildings. At the opposite end of this bridge, William Pitt traded, in a store contiguous to his tavern. He advertised"], [296, "1796. 266 Business at the Fort. that he would sell \"cheap for present pay, as he will keep no books,\" and affixed a price to each article in a long list in the advertisement. He had a bowling-alley in the gully, the first constructed in this section of country. \" Nearly opposite\" Pitts' tavern John Soule \"informs his friends and customers that he has opened a house of public entertainment.\" Ezra Smith opened a \"new vendue office\" in a building which stood on Winthrop street where the Kennebec House stable stood and Ricker's stable now stands, where he sold at auction \"a great variety of valuable articles.\" The store which stood above, at the present railroad crossing, long occupied by the late Charles Wil liams, and removed when the railroad was constructed, was built by Isaac Carter about this time. He had been a clerk in Capt. Wes ton's store, became his partner for a short time, and having pur chased Weston's interest in the stock of goods removed to the one he had erected. Lot Hamlen was his clerk at this time. \"Next door to the court house,\" Sanford & namlen kept. This store stood in. the corner of Dickman place and Winthrop street, on the site of the Journal office building, and was the same building on Water street occupied by John Wheeler at the time of the great fire in 1865. In the chamber over this store Peter Kitteridge carried on the saddler's business. Where the Franklin House stood Dr. Samuel Colman had a store, in which he kept groceries and drugs and medicines. In a room over the store Benjamin Whitwell had his office. On the opposite side of the street, Dickman & Bell occupied a small store vacated by John Davis, who had removed to Belgrade. They dissolved partnership during the year ; Dickman continued in the store, and Bell removed to the building occupied by Ezra Smith as an auction room, and which he had vacated to keep a tavern at Getchell's Corner in Vassalborough. This building, previously to its being tenanted by Smith, was occupied for the purposes of trade by Benjamin Baxter and James Black. Judge North had erected a large two story double store opposite the lot on which the Stanley House stood, in one tenement of which Gershom North traded. Next above, in the \" Eustes House,\" James Burton sold goods and kept the post office, and where the Phenix block, now Williams' block, stands, Isaac Savage had a blacksmith shop. On the eastern side of the river, the Howards were still largely engaged in trade, and had built during the year a vessel of three"], [297, "1796. Business at the Hook. 267 hundred tons burthen, called the Montezuma ; and Samuel How ard, Jr., son of Col. William Howard, had just commenced busi ness in connection with James Davidson of Bath. At the \" Hook\" scarcely less business enterprise was displayed. John Sheppard at his store sold fashionable English goods at \" wholesale and retail.\" He was an Englishman, and understood the brewing business, and this year built the \"Hallowell Brew cry,\" at which he advertised, in June of the next year, that he had \" strong beer and porter, by the cask or dozen, now ready for sale.\" But as stronger liquor was required for this market his operation was not profitable. John Odlin Page had just received a fresh assortment of English and West India goods ; Chandler Robbins opened a \" variety store,\" and among other things ad vertised \" India cottons and nankeens.\" Benjamin Gould had received sixteen hundred bushels corn from Philadelphia ; and Fillebrown and Stratton had a large assortment of goods ; Moses and David Sewall had an assortment of \"summer goods.\" Ben jamin Page kept drugs and medicines ; White and Lowell had a long advertisement of goocft of all descriptions ; and at Samuel Tobey's store could be found \" a small quantity of wheat flour for cash only.\" John Pickford had opened a \"new store nearly opposite the new meeting-house at the Hook, Hallowed;\" and Nathaniel Cogswell \"informs the public that he has taken the store lately occupied by Capt. John Molloy,\" where he had a great variety of articles, a list of which he published, including many miscellaneous books. Chandler Robbins in a subsequent paper had removed his \"variety store,\" and advertised a large assortment of goods \" at his new store opposite the post office.\" Robert Randall had \" a quantity of excellent Liverpool salt for sale at his store at the Hook;\" and the printer of the Tocsin had \"just published and had ready for sale by the gross, dozen or single, an almanack for the year 1797, calculated for the meridian of Hallowell;\" and Peter Edes advertised the publication by him of the \" School of Good Manners.\" Under the heading of \"Genteel and surprising Feats of Activity,\" Don Pedro Cloris announced an exhibition, at the shop of Dummer and Partridge, of \"a number of curious feats on the wire\" and \"entertaining performances on the rope, balancing, tumbling and posture feats.\" In the next paper the advertisement was renewed with the addition to the show of \"a beautiful Italian shade.\""], [298, "1796. 268 Separation at Pitt's Hall. Joseph Rice published proposals for carrying the Intelligencer and Tocsin to Farmington and intermediate places, going by way of Winthrop and returning by way of Readfield, at one cent for each paper. But his calling was soon ended, as the Tocsin, April 28, 1797, announced the establishment by law of a post-road from Hallowell to Farmington. The \" Kennebec Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons,\" gave notice by E. Greenleaf, their secre tary, that they would celebrate the \"Festival of St. John the Evangelist\" at Hallowell, December 27, 1796. Nathaniel Kent gave \"cash and the highest price for shipping furs at his store at the Hook;\" and Joshua Wingate & Son of the same place advertised largely various descriptions of goods, and among their special wants was a \"quantity of peas.\" Nathan Weston \"informed the public that he followed, coasting to and from Kennebec to Boston, in the schooner Minerva,\" and that he would purchase goods by the quantity on small commissions. During a session of the Supreme Court, which was holden on the second Tuesday of June at Hallowell, a \"number of respecta ble* citizens from every county in *tne District of Maine being present,\" a call was made by handbills posted about town for a meeting at William Pitt's hall to consider the subject of separa tion, at which a committee of sixteen was chosen, which reported a circular letter with a memorial to the legislature to be signed by the inhabitants of the district, asking that the sense of the district be again taken upon the question. In this memorial the petition ers complained of \"the inefficacious system of our judicial ad ministration,\" and remarked that \"this most important object of government has necessarily become slow in its operation and ruinous in its effect. The extent of this district, its great and increasing population, require something more energetic than an annual visit of the Supreme Judicial Court in several of the coun ties. The legislature have acknowledged the hardship and have attempted a reform.\"1 As a proper commentary on this it was stated in the Tocsin that the court was in session a fortnight, and adjourned on account of its being obliged to sit at Dedham the fourth Tuesday of August, after \"only five or six of the two hundred actions on the docket were tried. The expense to these counties, from the great number of witnesses attending so vainly, 'Tocsin, July 22, 1796."], [299, "1796. Petition for Kennebec Bridge. 269 operates as so heavy a tax that the warmest opponent to a separa tion must now be convinced of its necessity.\" The attention of the people of Hallowell had been for some time called to the enterprise of bridging the river. It was seen to be an undertaking of great difficulty, and of such magnitude as to require a united effort to accomplish it. But the two villages were each desirous of availing themselves of the advantages which would arise from its location, without the ability in either or even both united to build the bridge. The Fort claimed the location on the ground that the bridge would be at the head of the tide and not obstruct navigation. The Hook declared that they were at the head of navigation, and their village was the only suitable place for its erection. Daniel Cony was at this time senator, and James Bridge representative in the legislature, a strong delegation for the Fort, while the Hook had powerful friends to represent her interest. The subject came before the legislature, on the petition of Samuel Howard and others for leave to erect a bridge at the Fort. This petition Cony probably had, when, at old York, on his way to the legislature, he met with Maj. Sewall, who had acquired some rep utation in bridge building by erecting one at that place. Cony inquired of him if a bridge could be erected over the Kennebec at Hallowell. The Major looked dubious, and declared the project premature by fifty years ; however, he said if a pier could be made to stand it could be done. The petition was presented and referred to a committee of which Capt. Choate of Ipswich, father of the late Rufus Choate, was chair man. The Hook warmly opposed it, and made Charles Vaughan their agent to resist the application and advocate the location at the Hook village, where he had a landed interest. He was other wise a suitable agent, as from his character and connections he possessed great personal and family influence in Boston. During the examination by the committee depositions were read and witnesses examined. Capt. Choate made some inquiries in relation to \"Cobbossee,\" the Hook and Fort Western, showing a knowledge of those places which surprised Doctor Cony, and he inquired of him, at the conclusion of the hearing, as to his means of knowledge, when the captain informed him that he was ac quainted with the river, had ascended it to Fort Western when in the coasting business, and added, that that was the only suitable place for a bridge. The committee decided in favor of Fort Western, and an act was"], [300, "1796. 270 Kennebec Bridge Chartered. passed February 8, 1796, incorporating a company consisting of Samuel Howard, William Howard, Joseph North, Daniel Cony, Jedediah Jewett, Samuel Dutton, William Brooks, Mathew Hay ward and James Bridge with their associates by the name of the Proprietors of Kennebec Bridge, with authority to erect a bridge at Fort Western in Hallowell, between Pollard's ferry and the mill brook. This charter extended seventy-five years from the day the bridge should be opened to public travel. The Intelligencer of February 13th announced that permission had been granted to erect a bridge \"at Fort Western and at no other place,\" and on the twenth-eighth of the same month pub lished a notice signed by William Howard and Joseph North call ing a meeting of the bridge associates at the court-house, for the purpose of organizing the corporation, at which William Howard, Daniel Cony, James Bridge, Joseph North, George Crosby, Peter T. Vose and Elias Craig were chosen Directors; William Howard President; Daniel Cony Vice President ; James Bridge Treasurer ; and Samuel Howard, Jr. Clerk. Measures were now taken to speedily erect the bridge. Books of subscription to the stock were opened, proposals for the timber issued, and a meeting called \"to determine the most eligible situa tion\" within the limits of the charter for building. The active part which Daniel Cony had taken in procuring the charter aroused the indignation of some of the residents at the Hook. Dr. Cony, Alexander Campbell, Nathaniel Dummer and Isaac Parker were candidates for the office of senators. Two were to be chosen for the district composed of Lincoln, Hancock and Washington, and Hallowell at the election April 4th, gave Camp bell one hundred eighty-four votes, Dummer one hundred and six teen, Cony ninety-four, and Parker twenty-eight. It was supposed by the writer of an article in the Intelligencer, issued after the election under the signature of \"Rotation,\" that Dummer was elected over Cony, and he congratulated tbe public on Cony's defeat and the success of Dummer. This he considered right, on the score of rotation, Cony having held the office, \"and besides\" \u2014 he remarked \u2014 \"there is one other important reason for neglect ing the Doctor,\" which is \"that he was a principal agent and advo cate in the business of obtaining the act for building a bridge over \u2022the Kennebec at Fort Western.\" This effort of Cony's he consid ered a \"conceded fact,\" and inquires if \"it is not sufficient to damn his political reputation forever?\" He then adds, \" no man"], [301, "1796- Federal Currency Adopted. 271 4 of common sense and common honesty but must know that the Hook is, in most points of view, and it is said in all respects \u2014 being the head of navigation\u2014 the best place for a bridge.\" He further said, \"this point was proved beyond a doubt by the depo sitions of a number of honest men.\" The writer pertinently re marked, that the inquiry may be made, why Gen. Campbell was not \"rotated,\" as he had been in the senate as many years as Doctor Cony. \"Yet,\" he answered, \"the reason is plain, as every man of 'good sense' may see with one eye,1 that Gen. Campbell was not opposed to the Hook bridge.\" He finally concludes by ex pressing \"the consoling and animating expectation, that this business\"\u2014 of the bridge\u2014 \"will be set right, when Mr. Dummer takes his seat in the senate, and that the cause of injured justice, which has been so long bleeding at every pore will find an advocate in this able statesman.\" 2 However, contrary to the anticipation of this writer, Dummer was not elected. He received but four hundred and sixty-one votes ; Campbell had sixteen hundred and ten, and was elected ; Cony had ten hundred and thirty-eight, and Parker eight hundred and seventy-eight. Cony and Parker were the constitutional candidates to fill the vacancy, to which Parker was elected, and Cony went into the executive council. The annual meeting assembled \" at the public meeting-house \" March 21st. Seth Williams, Nathaniel Dummer and Beriah Ingra ham, a new board of selectmen, were chosen, and in consequence of a State law passed the preceding year the Federal currency of dollars and cents was adopted by the town in raising money. Seven hundred dollars were raised for schools, two hundred for highways and seven hundred and fifty \"for discharging the debts, supporting the poor and defraying other necessary charges of the town.\" Owing to the changing aspect of French affairs and \"their un warrantable conduct towards the sovereignty and commerce of the United States,\" political parties in this country were under going a change. The contest which commenced at the spring elections in' bitterness and rancor was continued during the presi dential canvass, and resulted in the ascendency of the federal party in the State and nation. The town of Hallowell at the gubernatorial election in April cast one hundred and fifteen votes for Samuel Adams, federalist, and twenty-two for Increase Suinner, 1 Dummer had a defective eye. * Ken.

A few weeks before the election the Intelligencer published communications under various signatures for and against the different candidates proposed, the editor preserving at all times a profound silence on the subject. The warmest personal language was used in relation to Dummer and Cony. The former was charged with being \" an open advo cate of Shay and his party in the late rebellion,\" and the latter was politically portrayed under the name of \"Doctor Focus.\" Cony was the leading politician at the Fort and was a republican, and Dummer was the chief politician at the Hook and was a fed eralist, and as the town as well as the State was fast becoming federal, this together with the local influence of the Hook, gave Dummer his senatorial vote and also elected Amos Stoddard, a federalist, representative. The federalists, as a badge indicating their political sentiments, wore a black cockade on their hats, and the republicans or demo crats a white one. At one time a young and ardent democrat, but now a venerable and distinguished citizen, attended a dance at Kennebec Hall with the distinguishing white badge of his politics on his hat. This gave offence to some of the federalists, who removed it. The republicans generally took offence at this, and George Warren, an ardent politician of that school, gave notice that he should attend armed with pistols the next dance with the young republican, and that the cockade would be worn. They did attend, it was worn, and was again taken off, but no blood was shed.1 It was customary for judges in their charges to grand juries to introduce political topics, which in times of great, political excite ment they extended at great length, and which were not unfre quentlj' published in the papers of the day. Judge David Sewall at his court in Portland on the twenty-first of June \" denounced the majority ol' the House of Representatives and all +hose who have opposed the late treaty with Great Britain.\" A correspon dent who communicate 1 this to the Tocsin remarked, \" We have no great objection to this humble imitation of Judge Dana; but we are happy to add that his honor did not attempt to put Talis men on the grand jury this term.\" The remarks which Chief Justice Dana made to the grand jury 1 Lot Hamlen."], [303, "1796.

The judge was strongly impressed with the critical con dition of public affairs, but he congratulated them, \"that the late majority of our representatives in congress, on mature deliberation, have become the minority.\" A grand jury in Rensselaer county, N.Y., responded to one of the political charges in strong terms, \" viewing with painful concern the wicked and disorganizing meas ures which are pursued by a combination of factious men, to sub vert the government and destroy the peace of the United States, and the infamous fabrications which are daily published by mer cenary and unprincipled printers to blast the reputation of tried and faithful officers of the Union, even the President not excepted.\" They conclude \"that every attempt to excite disgust against the constitution, and destroy the confidence of the people in the ad ministration, they view as an overt act of treason against the United States.\"1 At the May meeting for the choice of a representative in Hal lowell, the selectmen presented a circular letter from a \"committee in behalf of the memorialists\" in Boston, \"with certain papers relating to the treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain,\" which were referred to a committee of nine, who reported the following votes, which were passed \"by a large majority:\" Voted, That this town feels deeply impressed with the importance of hav ing the treaty lately concluded between the United States and Great Britain carried into complete effect ; and in order thereto, that it ought fairly and hon orably to be executed on the part of the United States.

In April of this year, the South parish took measures to erect a meeting-house at the Hook. A lot of land was purchased of Peter Clark, for one hundred and fifty dollars, and on the 5th of August the present \"Old South\" was raised. People came from Winthrop ' Kennebec Intelligencer, March 5, 1796. 18"], [304, "Bans of Matrimony Forbidden. 1796. 274 to assist at the raising. The house was then without a steeple, which with the basement and other improvements has since been added. Dr. Gillet continued to preach in this house till his dismis sion in May, 1827. He was succeeded by George Shepard in November of the same year, who remained till dismissed on a call to Bangor Seminary, October 1836. In May of this year, the bans of matrimony between James McMaster and Polly Pollard were forbidden by William Stodder, who addressed a letter to Henry Sewall, town clerk, requesting him to withhold the certificate of publishment \"until the matter can be duly inquired into.\" He said in the letter, \"the said Polly Pollard did promise to join in matrimony with roe, and to bind her self to her promise did break a gold ring with me. One half of said ring I now have in my possession, and the said Polly told an indifferent person that said ring was broken by ns on the promise of matrimony, which I can produce positive proof of.\" ! The cer tificate was withheld, and Stodder was required bylaw to apply to two justices, within seven days from filing his reasons, to investi gate the matter. This provision he evaded by filing weekly his reasons with the clerk until the last of the following September, when upon the application of Polly's father, who was armed with the written opinion of James Bridge and Benjamin Whitwell, the two legal advisers of the place, in his favor,2 the clerk issued the certificate, and poor Stodder with his broken ring emblematic of a broken heart was compelled to yield to his inexorable fate.

May 3d, the following editorial in the Tocsin : We see in the Intelligencer, a paper printed at a village two miles and a half above this place, a pompous account of the arrival of shipping at Fort Western, which is a village which derives its name from a block house that is still standing and makes a respectable part of the settlement. Had it been a thing uncommon or worthy of public notice we might have given our readers earlier information that those vessels named and many others all safely arrived at this port from sea ; and this week we might have added, that being favored with a freshet which brought the waters six feet above high water mark, part of the fleet seized the opportunity of a strong southerly wind and run their hazard to Fort Western. Considering that many gentlemen abroad may have their interest concerned in such desperate navigation, we think it a duty to inform them that the larger vessels have prudently fallen down without their lading to this port, and although they got aground, we are happy to add no material damage occurred \u2014 doubtless the rest will take into consideration the propriety of hastening their departure for the Hook. N. B. Those who may have concern for the ships of seventeen tons there mentioned may feel easy, for if the freshet should fall the navigation will be as usual \u2014 the men may get out and push such vessels over the shoals. The next Intelligencer, of May 10th, contains a communication in answer to the Tocsin, in which the writer says : Hearing a few discordant vibrations from the \" Alarm Bell,\" alias \"The Tocsin,\" last week, on the arrival of fifteen vessels at Fort Western in two days, and in order to give it an opportunity once more to chime if possible with greater harmony, we announce the safe arrival the last week of the following vessels. Then follows a list of twelve vessels, only one of which was in the former list. This was the nimble little craft called the Two Brothers, which had made her trip and returned. The writer con tinues : We are happy to add, that Capts. Dean and Howland, who were here last sum mer seven or eight times apiece, and loaded their vessels, which drew from seven and three-fourths to eight feet of water each time, have this spring loaded at and departed from this port with their usual draft\u2014 since the fall of the freshet Sloop Rising Sun, 53 tons, Capt.

Intelligencer 's View of Navigation. 276 \u2014notwithstanding a few very honest men have deposed that there was only seven feet in the best water on the shoals. We learn the ship Betsey of three hundred and seventeen tons, drawing about nine feet water, which was launched at this place a few days since, unfortunately struck on the shoalest ground between Fort Western and the entrance of the Kennebec ; but are happy to add, through the friendly exertions of the editors of the Tocsin, she was fortunately '-pushed over the shoals,\" and received no material injury. We hope they will render the same friendly assistance should the Montezuma of three hundred tons, which will be launched on Wednesday next by Messrs. Howards meet the like accident. We, however, congratulate the public on the fair prospect of this bar \u2014 which is an obstruction to the navigation of large vessels to Fort Western, the head of navigation \u2014 being shortly removed, as we understand a subscription for that purpose is on foot, and will doubtless be accomplished the next summer ; as also the Kennebec bridge will in all prob ability be erected at that time. These important objects, when accomplished, must at once decide on the decline of the increasing importance of the Hook village below. We however condole with the founder of the buildings at that place, viz. the brewery and juniper berry distillery, but believe, while the county is congenial to the growth of spruce, the seasons favorable to the pro duction of juniper berries, his exertions will meet with that recompense which he has heretofore experienced. We agree with the editors of the Tocsin that the passage of fifteen or twenty vessels for Fort Western in a week \"was not worthy of notice to his readers,\" while they did not think proper to stop at their village. We learn that one vessel dropped anchor the last week at the Hook village, and finding no pur chasers for her cargo, and that nothing could be obtained at that place but spruce beer and the spirits of juniper berries, immediately weighed anchor and proceeded to Fort Western, where she is now nearly loaded with fish and lumber. In a note printed in italics, the shoal on which the Betsey grounded is described as follows : A bar between Bomboohook and a small village about a mile above which derives its name from that place. Bomboohook is the place where the mer chants at Fort Western and others situated above them usually load their large coasters. The editor of the Tocsin ends the sparring on his part by briefly alluding, in his issue of May 20th, to the Intelligencer's article, in which he calls the writer \"the champion of Fort Western\" and \"hero of shallow water,\" and concludes by saying, \" If any per son of common ability will come forward with the assertions con tained in the last Intelligencer they shall be answered.\" While the Intelligencer of the same date gives notice of the \"arrivals at Fort Western since our last,\" under the heading of \"Another bone for the editors of the Tocsin to gnaw.\" These were eight vessels"], [307, "1796. Division of Town. 277 os which sloop Nancy, Capt. Pattee, of one hundred and four tons was one, and schooner Syren, Capt. Lilly, of one hundred and thir teen tons and twenty days from Jamaica, was another ; again on the 27th of May, the Tocsin gets \"another bone to gnaw\" in the arrival of six vessels \" since our last.\" The question of dividing the town was this year brought before a special meeting holden on the day of the representative election, which was called upon a written request signed by Joseph North, Matthew Hayward, Stutely Springer, James Burton, James Bridge, Elias Craig, Gershom North, Theophilus Hamlen, John Springer and George Crosby, all of the Fort. The Hook was probably out in strength at this meeting, and was at that time opposed to the division. Nathaniel Dummer was chosen moderator and \"the consideration of the subject referred to the next annual meeting.\" But this was not satisfactory to the Fort, which immediately started a petition to the General Court praying for a division, and a notice in the next Intelligencer, of May 20th, requested the subscribers to the petition to meet at the court house on the next Monday. This meeting was held, and \" Daniel Cony was appointed agent to prefer the petition to the General Court during its then session.\" In due time the town was notified by the General Court of the pending petition, and a town meeting was called at the court house, November 7th, to consider the subject, at which a commit tee from each parish was chosen \"to take the subject under con sideration and report their opinion\" at the next annual meeting, and Amos Stoddard, representative of the town, was directed to communicate the proceedings of the meeting to the General Court and request \" that the division may be deferred until the town can have an opportunity to agree thereon.\" The Hook was probably in ascendency at this meeting. Nathan Dummer was moderator. The committee of the South parish was Nathan Dummer, William Dorr, Amos Stoddard and Benjamin Poor; of the Middle parish, William Howard, Samuel Stevens and Moses Carr ; of the North parish, George Read and Jeremiah Badcock. The proceedings, however, were unavailing to delay the division. This was the last town meeting for town business which assembled in Hallowell before the division. A meeting was held subsequently, at the court-house, on the sixth day of the next February, for the purpose of voting for a congres sional representative for the first Eastern District, at which Henry"], [308, "1796. 278 Augusta Incorporated. \u2014 Plymouth Company. Dearborn received two hundred and eight votes, Jonathan Bow man thirty-two, and Isaac Parker seventeen. The legislature, on the 20th of February 1797, divided the town of Hallowell and incorporated the Middle and North parishes into a town by the name of Harrington, which name was changed to Augusta on the ninth of the following June. We have noticed the transactions of the Plymouth Company connected with the settlement of the country to 1768, when owing to the disturbed state of public affairs, and the large grants made* to proprietors, which placed extensive tracts of lands in their hands, and the success in disposing of lots assigned to settlers, a change occurred in the liberal policy of the company, resulting in recalling the favorable offers to settlers and curtailing the grants. Some proprietors desired to extend the division, and becoming im patient of the slow process heretofore adopted sought, after a few years, to hasten it by suits for partition, but the bounds of the patent were not fully established ; the title of individuals claiming to be proprietors not well ascertained ; and debts and litigation still required united action. But three grants were made in 1768, and during the following year but one to a settler. The block house at Fort Shirley, in Pownalborough, however, was granted to> the county of Lincoln ' ' so long as it should be improved as a goal,\" and one hundred acres of land \"to the minister and church wardens, for the time being, of the Episcopal Church of Pownal borough and their successors forever.\" In 1770 two lots at Fort Western were sold at auction. They were number nine west side, which came into possession of Dr. Gardiner, and number twenty-seven east side purchased by John Tileston. Robert Temple, \"in consideration of his great trouble and expense in bringing forward the settlements on the Kenne bec,\" was granted back lot number nineteen, on McKecknie's plan, and an extensive division of four hundred acre lots was made. But in the two following years no grants were made and no busi ness transacted with the exception of appointing John Adams of Braintree, attorney for the company. In 1774 two grants were made and a tract of land near Nor ridgewock was directed not to be sold \"under one shilling an acre.\" Samuel Goodwin had not been settled with since 1760, and some trouble arose with him on account of his \" unreasonable and groundless charges.\" He was called upon for Thwing's ac count book of \" supplies furnished Dutchmen and other settlers.\""], [309, "1796.

It being adjudged necessary that it should be cleared out so that foot passengers may pass, in order for the introduction of settlers on said road,\" and the company voted, \" That such road be cleared out at the expense of this proprietary as soon as may be.\" ' The lands directed to be sold this year to pay the debts of the company were purchased by individual proprietors. The storm of the Revolution which had been fast gathering and was ready to burst, caused such of the proprietors as adhered to the royal cause to absent themselves from the country and the meetings of the company. Dr. Gardiner, who was usually in at tendance, appeared for the last time April 26, 1775, a few days after the battle of Lexington. At the next adjournment, July 12th of the same year, the clerk attended at the Royal Exchange, \" but no proprietor appearing the meeting fell through.\" Nothing was done until May 26, 1776, when upon a call for a meeting for June 13th of the same year, seven proprietors assembled. These were James Bowdoin, James Pitts, Nathaniel Thwing, William Taylor, Jonathan Fox, Samuel Fowle and James Thwing. At the organiza tion James Bowdoin was chosen moderator. This meeting was kept alive by adjournments during the war and until December 13, 1786. With the exception of three or four grants of small lots no business was done in 1776 and '77, and nothing in 1778 but vot ing John Adams a fee of one hundred dollars \"to carry on the suit with Col. Tyng.\" This was Col. John Tyng, who was assert ing a right to an interest in the company's lands. In 1779 the only business transacted was a grant of a lot \" in consideration of one hundred continental dollars paid the clerk \" of the company ; and in the following year but one grant was made, which was of a lot in Vassalborough in consideration of \" \u00a360 lawful money.\" In 1781 the prospect of an early return of peace encouraged settlers, to whom numerous grants were made in the plantations of Norridgewock and Canaan. In the following year Rev. David Jewett, the first settled minister in Winthrop, was granted two hundred acres of land on condition that he should preach ten years 1 Plymouth Company Records, May 20, 1774."], [310, "Company Proceedings. \u2014 Squatters. 1796. 280 at that place from the time of his settlement. Grants were also made to proprietors to adjust differences arising from former divis ions. In 1783, upon the petition of the town of Hallowell, pre sented by Dr. Daniel Cony, Col. North was directed to. lay out a two hundred acre lot in any of the undivided lands in the town to be reserved for the use of the minister or ministers of said town forever. June 16, 1784, the suit with Col. John Tyng hav ing resulted in Tyng's favor, he and John Lowell, who claimed under the same right, were admitted proprietors. In the years 1785 and '86, but two or three grants were made to settlers and no business of importance done. The meeting \"fell through\" December 13th, of the latter year, from the non-attendance of pro prietors. The company did not again assemble till September 5, 1787, when under a new call an organization was effected, but no busi ness was transacted during the year. From this time to 1797 but few grants were made by the company to settlers, owing in part to the lands having passed into the hands of proprietors who were making sales. In 1789 a committee was appointed to defend the company's title and to adjust disputes with settlers ; also to institute suits against persons who were upon the lands of the company without title from the proprietors and claimed to hold adverse to them. The company this year determined in concurrence with the Gen eral Court the lines between their patent and the public lands, and Col. North on the part of the proprietors agreed with the committee for settling the eastern lands that Ephraim Ballard of Hallowell should run and mark the lines as agreed. John Jones of Hallowell, (now Augusta,) in 1790 petitioned the proprietors to grant two lots due him in Harlem for surveys \u2014 \"as he is an alien\" \u2014 to his brother Timothy Jones of Bradford, Mass., which were granted. In 1791 John Fox instituted a suit of petition for partition of the lands, which the company em ployed James Sullivan to defend. In March of the next year James Bridge was appointed agent and attorney for the corpora tion. This was the commencement of his connection with the company which continued for twenty years. The first action taken in relation to \" squatters\" was at a meet ing held December 13, 1792, when a committee was appointed \"to report what compensation should be made by persons who have set down on the lauds of this proprietee without leave since"], [311, "1796. Final Division Contemplated. 281 1778.\" John Lowell, James Sullivan and Oliver Wendell were appointed a \" committee on disputable titles.\" In 1793 James Bridge was directed \" to try, appeal and take care of\" the petition for partition of Joseph North and others ; he was also to inquire into the title of settlers, \" and commence suits against those who have no grants and whose possessions of twenty-five years or more makes the delay of a suit dangerous.\" In the next year Charles Vaughan, who had been agent, resigned, and Chandler Robbins was appointed in his place. In 1795 James Bridge was authorized to settle with persons on the proprietors' lands in Balltown, now Jefferson, who had been on prior to 1784, at the rate of two dollars per acre, and James Sullivan who was voted a retainer of \u00a330, was directed to send his written opinion to Mr. Bridge in relation to the Balltown settlers, and direct him in case the settlers do not demur to the actions pending against them, to give the cases to the jury and appeal from the verdicts. Charles Vaughan, Col. William Howard and Ebenezer Farwell were to repair to Balltown \"and estimate the value of lands in a wilderness state.\" Col. North was to inquire into lands conveyed by Dr. Gardiner belonging to the company and report. Measures were taken to make a final division of the company lands; a meeting was called for that purpose June 3d, by notice published in the Boston Centinel and Chronicle, \"and the Hallo well paper called the Eastern Star.\" At this meeting a committee was appointed \"to employ some gentleman to prepare a plan of settlement and division with a view of bringing the affairs of the company to a final close.\" In March of the next year Nathan Dane was employed for this purpose, and Col. North and Dr. Rich ard Perkins, who were a committee on grants, reported against making further grants, when it was ordered that \"no further grants to proprietors or settlers be made until Mr. Dane shall report his opinion on the subject of grants.\" With a view prob ably to suits then pending the proceedings of a meeting held July 3, 1755 were read and confirmed, and Mr. Dane was directed to report what would be necessary to equalize a division among the proprietors, \"to prepare a final division,\" and report what doings of the company ought to be confirmed. Early in 1797, Robert Hallowell, as executor of Dr. Gardiner's will, was called upon for his testate's account with the company, and Mr. Bridge was directed to discontinue suits against the Ball-"], [312, "1796. 282 Kennebec Proprietors. town settlers upon their giving obligations not to take advantage of the statute of limitations, and James Sullivan, who had another retainer of one hundred dollars, was requested to write Mr. Bridge on the subject of the proper obligation to be taken. The clerk was to cause the vote in relation to discontinuing suits against the Balltown settlers to be \" published in the Wiscasset, Hallowell and Harrington newspapers.\" No evidence of title had been exhibited by proprietors since 1764, and the proprietorships of that period were still taken in the transactions of the company. One twenty-fourth part of the patent was then considered a full share, and the shares at this time were represented by the heirs, devisees and assignees of the original proprietors. We will briefly trace them. The colony of New Plymouth on the 27th day of October 1661, granted the patent on the Kennebec and lands purchased of the Indians, extending on each side of the Kennebec fifteen miles in width from the southern limits of Cobbosseecontee to Wesserun sett, to Antipas Boyes, Edward Tyng. Thomas Brattle and John Winslow to hold in fee, in equal shares and as tenants in common. Antipas Boyes was a merchant of Boston, and was engaged with Valentine Hill, in 1661, in a purchase of land at Dover. He married Hill's daughter Hannah January 24, 1660, and died in 1669, leaving a son Antipas who is said to have gone to England. Boyes gave his fourth part of the patent to Antipas and Samuel Marshall. Antipas Marshall sold his share to Charles Apthorp, Thomas Hancock, Sylvester Gardiner and John Jones, two-sixths each to the two former and one-sixth each to the two latter. Samuel Marshall sold a part of his interest to Phineas Jones and a part to Bonner, from whom James Bowdoin, James Pitts and Benjamin Hallowell purchased one forty-eighth part each. Edward Tyng came from England to Boston in 1636. He was a merchant, and removed to Dunstable, Mass.; was representative in 1661, the year he purchased an interest in the patent. He was second assistant to the government from 1668 to '80, and died at Dunstable December 28, 1681. He had a large family of children by his wife Mary whose family name was Sears. He devised his one-fourth part of the patent to his wife, and she December 28, 1700, devised the same to four of her children, Edward, Jonathan, Mary and Elizabeth ; Jonathan died and his share was devised to and allowed by the proprietors to the other three children. Edward sold a part of his share to William Bowdoin ; Mary Tyng sold her"], [313, "1796. Kennebec Proprietors. 283 interest to John Goodwin ; Elizabeth sold half of her share to Jabez Fox, Jonathan Fox, Jonathan Reed and Samuel Fowle, and the other half she lest to her three children, Rev. Habijah Weld's wife, Rev. Nathan Stone's wife and her son, who left his share to his widow and she sold to John Tufts. Many years after John Tyng of Dunstable, son of Eleazer and grandson of Jonathan Tyng, whose share upon his death had been allowed to the other three children, commenced and prosecuted for years suits against the proprietors to enforce his right to the property under devise of his grand father Jonathan. His right was finally acknowledged and settled June 16, 1784, when he and John Lowell, who had acquired an interest through him, were admitted proprietors. The above statement of title under Edward Tyng, taken from Mr. Dane's report on title, erroneously states the relationship of Weld's wife as granddaughter of Edward the first through Eliza beth, whereas she was a great granddaughter through Edward 2d, whose daughter Mary married Rev. John Fox of Woburn, and their daughter Mary Fox married Rev. Habijah Weld, who was a great grandson of the first Edward through his daughter Hannah, who married Habijah Savage, and their daughter Mary Savage was Rev. Thomas Weld's second wife and the mother of Rev. Habijah Weld. Edward Tyng, the son of the original proprietor, removed to Falmouth in 1680 and married Elizabeth daughter of Thaddeus Clark. They had four children, Edward, Jonathan who died young, Mary and Elizabeth. Edward of Falmouth was one of the council in 1686 and '87 ; was appointed governor of Annapo lis, and on a voyage thither was taken by the French and died in France. The names of the second Edward's children are the same as those to whom Mary Tyng, wife of the original proprietor, is said to have devised one-fourth part of the patent. This may have produced confusion when, after the title had laid dormant ninety years, it was sought in 1751 to ascertain the ownership. Edward the third was alive at that time, but he died in 1755 and his son Edward was, in the records made up for 1753, but probably alter his father's death, called \"Young Edward.\"' He died a bachelor in England. Thomas Brattle was of Charlestown, Mass., in 1656, but re moved the next year to Boston, where he was one of the founders 1 Dane's Report, p. 5."], [314, "Kennebec Proprietors. 1796. 284 of the Old South church ; was captain in the artillery company in 1772, and representative for four years.

His wife died suddenly at a large wedding at her house, at which her niece Ann Shepard was mar ried, November 9, 1682. He died intestate July 22, 1683, leaving a large estate valued at \u00a37,227 16s. lOd. This is said to have been the largest at that time in New England. He left seven children, Thomas a graduate of Harvard in 1676 and one of the founders of Brattle Street church and a treasurer of Harvard College for twenty years died May 18, 1713 ; Elizabeth married to Nathaniel Oliver ; William a graduate of Harvard in .1680, ordained at Charlestown 1697, died February 15, 1717. His only child William, was graduated at Harvard in 1722, and was the father of Thomas a graduate of the same college in 1760. Cath arine married to John Eyre and afterwards to Wait Winthrop ; Bethia married to Joseph Parsons ; Mary married to John Mico ; and Edward. Under the Brattle right Sylvester Gardiner and Florentius Vas sall acquired rights by purchase of William Brattle ; Jacob Wen dall acquired title by Mary Mico, she having \"left her \" interest to him; Catharine Eyre, May, 7, 1725, \u2014 her name then being Winthrop, \u2014 devised her interest to her three children, John Eyre, Catharine Noyes and Bethia Walley. Catharine Eyre first mar ried David Jeffries and afterwards Oliver Noyes, and by deed conveyed an interest to her son David Jeffries. John Eyre sold to Gershom Flagg, and John Walley took by derivation from his mother Bethia. Elizabeth's interest passed by purchase to Bel cher Noyes, Nathaniel Thwing, Benjamin Hallowell and Sarah Smith. John Winslow, an original purchaser of one-fourth part of the patent, was a brother of Edward Winslow who came over in the Mayflower. John came over in the Fortune in 1623 to Plymouth, where he married Mary Chilton, by whom he had nine children. He was representative three years previous to 1657, when he removed to Boston, where he was a thrifty merchant; he was admitted freeman 1672 and died 1674, aged seventy-seven. He sold two-fifths of his quarter to Robert Temple and two-fifths to Jolliffe, retaining himself a fifth. Jolliffe devised his interest to Mary Balston ; she sold to Jarpes Bowdoin and Valentine.

The owners of shares in the patent were incorporated in June 1753 by the name of \"The Proprietors of the Kennebec Purchase from the late Colony of New-Plymouth,\" and this became their legal designation, but they were commonly called the \" Kennebec Company\" and the \" Plymouth Company.\" In December of the year of their incorporation the company assessed the first tax on the shares, when it became necessary to ascertain definitely who were owners and the amount of interest of each. This was done, and divisions of the land among the share holders were made from time to time by drawing for surveyed lots. These divisions were by the acre and without reference to any difference there might be in value from soil and location. The first division was in 1756. The second division commenced February 8, 1764, at which time it was voted that the grant to each proprietor of the divided lands should be made \"in consideration of his great trouble and expense in bringing forward settlements on Kennebec river.\" This con sideration has been noticed by some writers in connection with the grants to Dr. Sylvester Gardiner as indicating special merit on his part in promoting settlements on the Kennebec. This is not s6, as it was a nominal consideration contained in grants to all the proprietors at this division.1 Five divisions of land were made to 1796, at which time and in 1753, when the first assessment was made, the shares are recorded as follows : December 13, 1753.

James Bowdoin, proprietor in the Plymouth Company in 1753 was the father of James Bowdoin proprietor in 1796. They descended from Peter Bowdoin, a physician of Rochelle in France, who fled on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and landed at Falmouth, now Portland, in 1688 with his wife and four children, James and John and two daughters. He escaped from Falmouth, the day previous to the destruction of the town by the Indians in 1690, and landed in Boston, where he deceased previous to 1717. His son James, an eminent merchant, acquired a large estate and died in 1747, at the age of seventy-one years, leaving two sons, James and William, by a second wife. This son James was the Kenne- bec proprietor of 1753 and a graduate of Harvard in 1745. He represented Boston in the General Court in 1753, '54 and '55, and was chosen to the executive council in 1756. He continued to hold that office with brief intermission until 1780 ; was governor of Massachusetts in 1785 and '86. He was a statesman, and was fond of literary and scientific research. We believe him to have been the most efficient and influential proprietor in causing the limits of the Kennebec Patent to be extended and established and its titles confirmed. He had two children ; a son James born September 22, 1752, was the proprietor of 1796, aud a munificent patron of Bowdoin College ; a daughter married Sir John Tem- ple, a consul general of Great Britain for the United States. The last named James Bowdoin, who owned about a tenth of the Plymouth Patent, was a graduate of Harvard in 1771; mar ried a daughter of his uncle William who was his father's half brother. He died in 1811 without issue, and Gen. Henry Dear born married his widow. The male line is now extinct, but the name has been revived by a descendant in the female line, a son"], [317, "1796.

Robert Temple, one of the proprietors, had been an officer in the English army. He was a descendant of Sir John Temple of Stanton Bury, England, who died in 1632. Conceiving the design of establishing himself as a landed proprietor in America, he came to Boston in 1717 with Capt. James Luzmore of Topsham. Hav ing visited the Kennebec in company with gentlemen interested in lands on that river, he was impressed with the value of the lands, and acquired rights in the Plymouth Patent and engaged to plant a colony on their lands. In furtherance of this enterprise he chartered, in 1718, two ships and in the following year three more to bring families from Ireland, which he settled mostly at a place named Cork in the north part of the present city of Bath, which place is called Ireland to this daj\\ Lovwell's war, in 1722, broke up the settlement and scattered his colonists, many of whom went to Pennsylvania. Temple was a young man when he engaged in the enterprise, and remained in the country notwithstanding its failure. He mar ried in 1727 Mehitable Nelson, daughter of John Nelson of Gray's Inn, London, and granddaughter, through her mother, of Sir John Temple. By this marriage he had six children. Robert, the eldest, married a daughter of Gov. Shirlej7 ; John, another son, became a baronet and married Elizabeth, a daughter of Gov. Bow doin ; their daughter Elizabeth Temple married Thomas L. Win throp, a descendant of the first governor and founder of Massa chusetts. Of this union came the distinguished statesman Robert C. Winthrop of Boston, and Elizabeth Temple Winthrop long residing at Augusta, wife of the Rev. Dr. Tappan, the faithful pastor for many years of the South Parish church. Florentius Vassall, a proprietor of one-twenty-fourth part of the Plymouth Patent, was a great grandson of Samuel Vassall of London, who flourished in the time of Charles the First, and son of William Vassall who came to Massachusetts as early as 1630. Florentius was born in Massachusetts, where he passed his early years, but afterwards removed to England, where a large part of his property lay. He died at London in 1778, leaving a will executed the year previously by which he gave his estate in entail to the male children of his granddaughter Elizabeth, daughter of 1 Maine Hist. Soc.

Henry Webster, after his mother's death attempted to enforce his claim to the Vassall lands. He brought actions against per sons in possession of some of the lands, in the United States Court at Portland ; one was against Caleb Gilm'an, for a tract of land in Somerset county, which upon trial was decided against the claim ant, the tenant having been in possession forty years ; another was against Henry Cooper of Pittston. These cases caused consider able excitement at the time with the holders of the Vassall lands, which was not fully allayed until a decision by the Supreme Court at Washington quieted the holders in their possessions. The will of Florentius Vassall was filed by copy in the Probate office in Kennebec in June 1837. It is dated September 20, 1777, and is written in old English text-hand on eleven sheets of parch ment, each sheet twenty-four by thirty inches ; the letters are cut almost with the uniformity and accuracy of type. It doubtless is a sac-simile of the original, and is authenticated under the seal of the Prerogative Court by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1828.

His son Thomas Hancock was a rich and benevolent merchant of Boston who died in 1764 without children. Another son, Rev.

He became very rich, for that period, both in landed estate and navi gation. He is said to have had \"a fine person and courteous man ners, and was one of the most popular men of his day.\" He early sided with the colonies in the revolutionary struggle, and on account of his great influence was pursued with more than ordi nary malice by the agents of the royal cause ; as President of the Continental Congress his signature, first on the Declaration of Inde pendence, is in a bold dashing hand. On the adoption of the State constitution in 1780, he was chosen governor of Massachusetts, and filled the office till 1785. In 1787 he was re-elected and held the office until his death October 8, 1793, at the age of fifty-six years. Sylvester Gardiner, one of the largest owners in the Plymouth Company, was a son of William Gardiner of South Kingston, R. I., where Sylvester was born in 1707. He was educated abroad for the medical profession, and settled in Boston, where he practiced and engaged in the business of importing drugs, from which he realized large profits and is said to have accumulated a fortune. He early became connected with the Plymouth Company, which was organized September 21, 1749. His name first appears on the records at a meeting held December 6, 1751; he was then forty-four years of age, in the prime of life, enterprising and energetic, with sound judgment and practical business talent. Conceiving the plan of settling a town upon the Kennebec, Dr. Gardiner selected Cobbossee as the most desirable place on ac count of the stream with its waterfall and the depth of water in the river. He obtained a grant at that place in December 1754, with a view to commence his enterprise. The French and Indian war, which soon followed, postponed the contemplated settlement until the fall of 1760, when a small company of artizans and laborers under his patronage laid the foundation of the present flourish ing city of Gardiner. He built a dam on the stream and a saw-mill and grist-mill and dwelling houses, and finally a fulling-mill, potash, wharf and stores. He cleared land and commenced settlements at other places on the river ; they, however, were all on his own lands.

This winter service was by special agreement with the company for which he received a grant of land on Sheepscot river. It has been said that Dr. Gardiner was, at the organization of the com pany, \" almost immediately made perpetual moderator of all their meetings,\" and that from that time to the Revolution, \"he devised all their plans, and directed all their measures.\" ' These are mis takes, and it is not necessary in order to give Dr. Gardiner the full credit for his efforts that they should go uncorrected. He was not moderator until the fourth meeting, which was held October 17, 1752, and continued by adjournments until September 12, 1753. William Boardman was then moderator for ten consecutive years until January 1764, when Dr. Gardiner was again moderator and continued from that time until April 26, 1775, when his attendance at the meetings of the company ended. The standing committee wielded the executive power of the cor poration. Dr. Gardiner does not appear to have been on this com mittee until 1754, and never was its chairman. He \"devised plans and directed measures\" for the improvement of his own estate, and acted with other members of the committee in relation to matters affecting the general welfare of the company. Samuel Goodwin, a proprietor, was appointed in 1753 \"to carry on the settlements up the Kennebec,\" he was the agent of the com pany, resided at Frankfort, and had the general direction and man agement of their affairs in relation to the settlements. The Bow doins, Temple, and the Hancocks were the men who possessed the influence and had the ability to promote the most important inter ests of the company in relation to their patent. Some of them were in the government, and were connected with each other and the governor by marriage ties. Their title to the patent and its extent were in dispute. The courts on questions of land titles were lean ing in favor of \"actual entries\" and \"ancient possessions.\" The proprietors were anxious to make the entries by surveys and under grants, and to hold possession of the lands by settlers who would actually occupy, and by procuring submission to their title of those already'in possession ; hence the efforts and liberal terms of the company to induce settlers to occupy and hold the lands in advance of rival claimants. Mr. Bowdoin maintained the claims 1 Maine Hist. Coll., vol. 2, p. 279, from which it appears to -have been taken for some historical works."], [321, "1796.

Robert Temple in furtherance of the same object introduced emigrants by ship loads, and all combined to influence and assist government in the erection of the forts and defending the territory from the Indians and a foreign foe. Dr. Gardiner in these efforts was but one, and not the greatest in influence with the government, we are inclined to think. Dr. Gardiner continued to foster his settlements at Cobbossee and other places, from which he had formed high expectations, which doubtless would have been realized, had it not been for the growing troubles with the mother country, which ended his efforts and sent him abroad with the British fleet when Boston was evacuated. He resided abroad during the war, but returned at its conclusion and resided in Newport, R. I., where he resumed the practice of his pro fession, and suddenly died August 8, 1786, aged seventy -nine years. The citizens of Newport attested his worth by a general attendance at his funeral, and the shipping in port displayed its colors at half mast. Dr. Gardiner married Anne Gibbons, daughter of Dr. Gibbons. They had six children. John Gardiner, the eldest son, completed his education in England, where he studied law in the Inner Tem ple and practiced in the courts of Westminster Hall. He was attorney general in the West Indies, residing at St. Christopher, and afterwards removed to Boston, and from there to Pownalbor ough, and was lost in a vessel which was wrecked on a passage to Boston where he was proceeding to attend the General Court as representative from that town in 1793. He was a whig, and was celebrated for his legal attainments and eminent abilities as a law yer. His son John Sylvester John Gardiner, rector of Trinity church Boston for twenty-five years, married Mary Howard, daughter of Col. William Howard of Augusta ; they had a son William H.

Their daughter Hannah married Frederic Allen of Gardiner. Gershom Flagg was a descendant of Thomas Flagg \u2014 or Flegg as it was then written \u2014 of Watertown, Mass., the emigrant ancestor of many Flaggs in the country. Thomas came over in 1637 from Scratby in the Hundred of East Flegg, Norfolk county, England. Gershom is connected with our history as a Plymouth proprietor and as ancestor of the Flaggs, Norths, Bridges and Fullers of Augusta. He resided in Boston where he was born in 1705 ; he was in early life a \" housewright and glazier.\" At the rebuilding of Fort Richmond, on the Kennebec, in 1740, he was employed to do the glazing, and when governor Pownal went to the Penobscot in 1759 to build Fort Pownal, Flagg accompanied him as a con tractor for a part of the work. He is mentioned in Pownal' s jour nal as having completed at Falmouth some necessary preparation for his work. He owned one forty-eighth part of the Plymouth Patent, which was half of one full share. In the division of the company lands lot number eight, west side of the river in Augusta, fell to him, and was early settled by his de scendants, some of whom own portions of it at this day. Upon this lot is built a dense part of the city. It extends from Market square to above Bridge street on the river, and a mile from the river. His lands on the Kennebec made him wealthy for the times as they had developed somewhat of their value during his life. He lived in a house on Hanover street, Boston, where the American House now is, which his father bequeathed to him and which he left to his heirs at his decease. Gershom Flagg married, March 16, 1730, Lydia Calleuder, a daughter of Rev. E. Callender a Baptist minis ter. She died without issue and he married July 4, 1736, Hannah Pitson, a daughter of James Pitson' merchant of Boston.

He died suddenly at \" Brattle Tavern,\" School street, Boston, March 23, 1771, probably of paralysis of the heart. He had two sons, Ger shom and James, and four daughters, Hannah, Elizabeth, Mary and Grizzel Apthorp. Gershom the son removed from Lancaster, Mass., to Clinton, Me., and settled on lands inherited from his father ; he died at Clinton leaving eight children. James was a mer chant ; he came to the Kennebec and settled on a five acre lot, in 1762, in what is now Gardiner. He built on this lot the old curbed roof building at the head of Gay's wharf; August 24, 1765 he mortgaged this, with the house and a barn on it to Col. Joseph North, and afterwards sold it to Col. North and removed to Bos ton, where he was employed by the Apthorps in mercantile busi ness, and finally went to the West Indies where he died in 1775, unmarried. Col. North was appointed administrator on his estate, and was authorized to sell his real estate \"to the amount of \u00a32850 in specie, to be applied to the payment of his just debts.\" Under this authority, \"at a vendue\" held at Amos Pollard's, innholder, in Hallowell, December 23, 1782, he sold to William Howard of Augusta, three thousand seven hundred acres of land on the east side of the Kennebec, \"about four miles above old Norridgewock,\" for \u00a319 5s. 5d. The lot 6old for this small pittance was a half a mile wide by fifteen miles long.1 Hannah, the eldest daughter of Gershom Flagg, was married to Col. Joseph North ; Elizabeth to Rev.

His son Robert Hallowell was born in Boston in 1739, and married Hannah Gardiner, daughter of Dr. Sylvester Gardiner ; their son Robert Hallowell, who took the name of Gar diner, received by will the bulk of Dr. Gardiner's large landed estate upon the Kennebec. Benjamin Hallowell's daughter Sarah married Samuel Vaughan of London, and was the mother of Ben jamin and Charles Vaughan of Hallowell. She died in England in 1809. Another daughter, Ann Hallowell, married Gen. Gould, and died in England in 1812. In June, Ephraim Ballard of Augusta wrote the company that he had ascertained the general course of the Kennebec from \" Cob bossee stream \" down to the \" chops ;\" that he had \" searched for and found to a certainty the utmost limits of Cobbosseecontee towards the western ocean,\" and that he had run \"from said utmost limits \" and marked a line to the river at right angles to> its general course, which line he found to be \"east southeast.\"1 He further says that he had consulted with Col. North upon the subject of running the line fifteen miles from the river, and the Colonel was of opinion that the matter had better rest until the session of the Supreme Court at Augusta, and adds that he is doubtful whether he could run it \"without being opposed, inter rupted and perhaps abused and injured, as he and some other surveyors have heretofore been by some of the settlers.'\" In a postscript he gives his view of the famous \" utmost limits of Cob bosseecontee,\" which he says \"is to be understood the very southernmost place where there is any\u2014 the least appearance of \u2014 water running into the stream of that name.\" The clerk, who was going to Augusta, was authorized to take \u00a37 10s. to pay Mr. Ballard \"in full for ascertaining the utmost limits of Cobbossee contee.\" The tedious course of litigation which it became necessary for the Plymouth Company to pursue to enforce their claims is shown by an action of ejectment brought in the Supreme Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in 1764, by David Jeffries, their clerk, for possession of a lot of land on the Kennebec. It was against Joseph Sargent, who vouched in Nathaniel Donnel to defend. In the next year Dontiel prevailed in the action and Jef fries obtained a writ of review, in which process judgment was"], [327, "1796.

Jeffries now appealed to his majesty in council, and the case was transferred to' England, where, after lengthy proceedings at the end of seven years' liti gation, the judgment was reversed and a new trial granted in 1771, with probably a more favorable result for the company. A num ber of original papers were sent to England to be used in the trial of the case, which in 1798 were needed in causes pending in Massachusetts, and James Bowdoin was directed to write for them.1 In 1798, Maj. Samuel Goodwin of Dresden was required to release to the company the court house, jail and jail house with two hundred acres of land in his possession, in default of which a committee chosen for the purpose was to obtain possession, saving Goodwin the right to reside thereon during his natural life by paying one dollar per annum. James Sullivan was to furnish Nathan Dane with a copy of his opinion given to the General Court, in the year 1788, respecting \" the utmost limits of Cobbosseecontee towards the western ocean,\" and such evidence and documents as shall have a ten dency \"to show the said utmost limits to extend to the most southern point of the waters of Cobbosseecontee, agreeably to the survey of Stephen Hosmer made by order of court in 1765.\" Ephraim Ballard, the ancestor of the Ballards of Augusta, at the age of fifty years, removed from Oxford, Mass., in 1775, to Fort Halifax. On the 15th of October, 1777, he came to Augusta, (then Hallowed,) and moved into the house belonging to John Jones, and came into possession of the property which Jones had left in his flight. This he retained for many years, occupying the mills that Jones had built. The saw mill was burnt while in his possession, and the next year he erected another on its site. He had previously erected a dwelling-house, which was long known as the \"Ballard house,\" near Bridge's lower dam, on the site now occupied by the \" Glen Cottage \" built by William Bridge.

He lived at the mills on Bond's brook until April 12, 1791, when he yielded possession to Peter Jones, John's brother, and removed into \"the house which was old Lieut. Howard's,\" on lot number one, below the \"mile rock,\" on the west side of the river, where he resided until November 1, 1799, when he removed to his son \"Jonathan's farm,\" about a mile from the village on the river road to Sidney. Mr. Ballard was a surveyor of lands and was employed frequently by the settlers to \" run out\" their lots, and was employed by the Plymouth Company, under the direction of Col. North, to ascertain the \"utmost limits of Cobbosseecontee towards the western ocean.\" While in the employment of this company on lands in the neighborhood of Balltown he was driven off by armed men \" who robbed him of his papers and instruments.

He married Hannah Moore of Oxford, Mass., December 19, 1754, by whom he had three sons, Cyrus, Jonathan and Ephraim, and two daughters, Hannah married to Moses Pollard and Dolly the wife of Barnabas Lambard. Mr. Ballard died January 7, 1821, at the advanced age of ninety-six. Mrs. Ephraim Ballard was one of those rare women we occa sionally find full of life and energy with great power of endurance. She was extensively employed in midwifery, at a time when that branch of medical practice was almost wholly entrusted to women. At forty years of age, in the prime of life, she came to reside in Augusta, then Hallowell, and must have been a valuable acquisi tion on account of her experience and skill to the settlement. There were but few children born in Hallowell and Augusta for twenty years after her arrival at whose birth she did not preside.

On November 15, 1795, she records, in attending at the birth of Theophilus Hamlen's second son, that \" This is the six hundredth birth at which I have attended since I came to this eastern clime ;\" again July 25, 1797, in attending the birth of Jesse Kimball's son, she says, \"It is the thirty-fourth which I have attended this year\" and \"the seven hundredth since June 1778.\" At this time \u2014 1797 \u2014 Doctors Cony and Page were noted by her as beginning to practice obstetrics, but as Mrs. Ballard thought without much success. She was frequently called in other cases, for which she successfully prescribed, but if they proved to be dif ficult she called Dr. Cony. In visiting her patients she frequently endured great hardships, suffering no obstacles to deter her, at times going miles on foot when the way was impassable for horses, being drawn across the river when the ice was tender or broken, braving the tempest at midnight, and after exhausting labor only recording that she was \"much fatigued.\" Her fees, in most cases, were gratuities apparently wholly inadequate to the services rendered, while in many cases, from poverty, her visits proved to be labors of love. She kept a diary from 1784 to 1812, in which she noted some matters of local interest, but most of the entries relate to family affairs, domestic employments and professional calls. There is scarcely a day during the period of twenty-eight years that she has not recorded where she was and what she was about, noting par ticularly the births and deaths as they occurred. The records are brief and with some exceptions not of general interest. She was a religious woman, and the last entry in her diary, Aug. 7, 1812, is, \"Rev. Mr. Tappan came and conversed sweetly and made a prayer adapted to my case.\" She died within two or three weeks follow ing this last entry, aged seventy-seven years. William Brooks descended from Thomas Brooks who came over to Watertown, Mass., as early as 1636 and soon removed to Con cord, Mass. William was educated at Harvard College, where he was graduated in 1780. He came to Fort Western settlement in 1784, and opened a store in a small building at the mouth of Bond's brook before any road crossed it below Jones' mills. With the"], [330, "Moses Child. 1796. 298 exception of Capt. Weston, who traded at what is now the foot of Court street, he was at this time the only trader on the west side of the river. He lived in his store keeping bachelor's hall as late as 1788, when he settled with Mrs. Ballard for baking his bread.1 He was distinguished from John and Silas, who afterwards came to Augusta, by the title of \"Esquire Brooks.\" While at the brook he kept school in the chamber over his store. Judge Weston recollects when he was quite young of attending his school and of some impressive lessons he gave him to aid his enunciation of difficult letters. In June 1788, he married Susanna Howard, widow of Judge James Howard, and moved to the east side of the river, where he afterwards traded in company with his nephew John Brooks. He built the large house on the lot next to the United States Arsenal, long occupied by the late John H. Hartwell and now owned by Allen Lambard. He was the first graduate of a college who resided in Hallowell, and was many years a magistrate, and several years one of the selectmen. One who knew him well has borne honorable testimony to his character, saying, \"In the several stations and relations of life he was respected and esteemed as an upright magistrate, a faithful friend, and worthy man.\" 2 He had but one child, a daughter Eliza who was married to John H.

After twenty-six years of united struggles, trials and labors the town of Hallowell was divided, and the Hook settlement, from which we are now constrained to part, started in its separate career with the prestige of the good old name of the town of which it had long formed an important part. To the new town was given, by Amos Stoddard at that time representative, the name of Harrington, in honor of Lord Harrington a distinguished English patriot. This name was not agreeable to the town, and immediate measures were taken to change it. The selectmen, acting under instructions given them in town meeting, in a peti tion to the legislature say, \"that for many reasons which operate in the minds of your petitioners they are desirous that the name of Harrington may be changed for the name of Augusta,\" and forbearing to give \" a lengthy detail of reasons,\" they \" presume on the indulgence of the legislature,\" and doubt not the favor they ask \" will be readily granted.\" It was granted, and June 9th Harrington became Augusta. Nearly two-thirds of the ter ritory and about half the population and valuation of Hallowell were embraced within the limits of the new town. At this time the population of Augusta, represented by 250 polls, lived in 119 houses, possessed 84 barns, 21 shops, 74 horses, 157 oxen, 307 cows and three years' old cattle, and 219 younger cattle, and was assessed for $6,870 stock in trade, $3,000 money at interest, 626 tons of shipping, seven saw mills and three grist mills. These statistics show that Augusta possessed at its incorpora tion the elements of wealth and prosperity in as great a measure as the town of Hallowell in 1792, five years previous, and its population by actual enumeration in May, 1798, was found to be 1,140, embraced in 184 families; 581 were 'males, 559 females ; 488 were under 16 years of age and 652 over that age."], [334, "1797. 302 Incorporation of Harrington. The judicial courts, which had been uniformly held in that part of Hallowell which became Augusta, were by the act of incorpo ration continued at Augusta \"until the further order of the legis lature.\" But probably at the instigation of Stoddard, the repre sentative who resided at the Hook, a preamble to the section containing this provision was inserted, declaring that \"the general convenience of the county and the accommodation of the courts may hereafter require their removal to the town of Hallowell.\" The two towns, rivals in business, now started in a career of prosperity uninterrupted for some years. Hallowell secured most of the trade of the agricultural towns in the western part of the county. This was probably owing in part to the mountainous height of \"Burnt hill\" over which it must have passed to reach Augusta. She also extended her trade to the seaboard towns east of the river, which came across the country in winter to exchange their commodities for goods. Augusta was engaged in navigation, and in the lumber trade with the towns on the river above. Both, however, advanced with nearly even pace until some years after, when the disastrous measures of the gen eral government paralyzed the business of the country, and fell eventually, during the war which followed, with crushing weight upon Augusta. Hallowell was stricken and crippled, but owing to the nature of her business better sustained the shock, and finally gathered strength to outstrip, for a time, in business and growth her less fortunate rival.

The annual meeting for the State election was now held, when Increase Sumner, the federal candidate, who was this year elected governor, received thirty-eight votes to twenty-seven for Moses Gill his republican opponent. At the representative election, which soon followed and was warmly contested, a much larger vote was thrown. Daniel Cony, the leader of the federal forces, had sixty votes and was elected over Nathan Weston, the republican candi date, who had fifty-seven. A writer in the Gazette, however, says, \"a number of republicans were on their way to vote for Weston and would have changed the result had not the polls been hastily closed.\" The population at this time, on the east side of the river, was confined chiefly to the front or river lots. On the west side it was much the largest, extending over the back lots towards Winthrop and Readfield. Up Bond's brook Cummings had a saw and grist mill at what is now Coombs' Mills, and on the same stream above Lyon had a grist-mill, and Col. Dutton owned the farm and had built the large house belonging to the estate of the late Isaac San ford and now occupied by his widow, and Deacon Page's \"beauti ful improvements\" of an earlier day had probably been much en larged. But the eight school districts into which the town was divided at the May meeting show the direction in which the popu lation was spreading.

The subscription to the stock of the Kennebec Bridge had, through the influence of powerful friends which the enterprise created, reached the sum of fifteen thousand dollars when its erec tion was commenced May 5th under the superintendence of Capt. Boynton, a skillful architect. The undertaking was of great magnitude, and could not have been accomplished by the unaided efforts of the community in which it originated. The Massachusetts proprietors of land on the Kennebec, Bowdoin, Loring, Winthrop and others, came with liberal hands to its assistance and subscribed for nearly half the stock. A few shares were taken up and down the river, and Leonard Jarvis, an owner of lands beyond the Penobscot, took twelve shares; the balance was subscribed by the citizens of Augusta. In the progress of the work the subscription proved insufficient, and it became necessary to raise an additional sum, which was"], [344, "Kennebec Bridge Erected. 1797. 312 effected with great difficulty by further subscriptions. Shares and parts of shares were taken and in some instances four united to take one share. The stock was thus increased to one hundred and ninety shares of one hundred dollars each, at which it has ever remained. It was, however, found upon the completion of the bridge that it had cost twenty-seven thousand dollars, and that the company was largely in debt. This indebtedness was eventu ally paid from the earnings. It was not until eight years had expired that a dividend was received by the stockholders.1 KENNEBEC BKIDGE, 1797. As the foundation for the pier, which was of wood, was being prepared to be sunk a casualty occurred which resulted in the loss of life. John Coverly, \"a promising young man\" who was clerk in Kobinson & Crosby's store, started in a boat in the even ing to cross the river to Fort Western, and was never heard from afterwards. Some Indians in camp upon the bank of the river were at the village that evening, and suspicion rested upon them of having put him out of the way ; but the better opinion seemed to prevail that his boat struck one of the ropes which held the foundation of the pier, by which he was thrown into the river and drowned. The boat was found the next morning on the shore below.2 Tradition has magnified this casualty into a horrid murder by the Indians, attended by unreasonable and contradict ory circumstances of time and place and manner of execution, which the most credulous upon reflection would not believe. The pier of the bridge was built of stone above low water mark, on a wooden foundation forty feet square, made of large timbers locked together and braced from side to side, filled with ballast and floored with heavy timbers upon which stone walls nine feet thick were placed, forming on the inside an oval or egg shaped 1 Reuel Williams. 'Daniel Savage."], [345, "1797. Bridge Completed. 313 <* opening. This form of construction and weight of granite gave a strength which has withstood the \"ice freshets\" of nearly three fourths of a century. The heater of the pier was of wood strapped with iron, which in time decayed and was crushed by moving ice in a freshet and was renewed with stone. The pier was finished on the ninth of September amid much rejoicing. The slumbering echoes of the valley were awakened on the occasion by \"seven discharges of a field-piece and three cheers.\" ' The abutments were also built of stone, with short wooden heaters running to the banks which have since been renewed with stone ; from the banks timber and truss work reached to the abut ments. The superstructure was substantially on the plan of the present bridge, but with larger timber and arches of less curvature, and was without covering. The flooring had a rise between the abutments and pier conforming more to the form of the arches than the present bridge. The upright timbers were very large and capped with round balls. The frame work was painted white, except the base as high as the railing, which was of a reddish brown, and the whole structure appeared very graceful and elegant. The engrav ing, from the seal of the corporation, is a substantial representation of the bridge, although the picturesque appearance of its white timbers and dark base in contrast with surrounding objects cannot be represented ; yet it may serve to revive recollections of the beautiful structure. The granite used for the masonry was ob tained from boulders, the stratified granite so abundantly quar ried at the present day being then unknown. Some of the timbers used in the construction were seventy feet in length, sixteen inches square at the top end and sixteen by eighteen and a half inches at the other end.* The completion of the bridge on the 21st of November was the most important event which had occurred since the settlement of the town. It was duly observed by a dinner \"in Dr. Cony's store chamber,\" at which the proprietors, workmen and citizens sat down.3 It was doubtless a joyous occasion, accompanied with the usual hilarity attending such observances at that day. Cannon were fired responsive to toasts given, and David Wall, James Savage and Asa Fletcher who were managing the gun were injured by some of the cartridges taking fire.4 1 Mrs. Ballard's Diary. 2 Kennebec Intelligencer. 3 Sewall's Diary. This was probably the old building used afterwards by David Thomas as a tavern. 4 Mrs. Ballard's Diary."], [346, "Complimentary Office. 1798. 314 At this time the bridge was not only the only one across the Kennebec but was the greatest enterprise of the kind yet under taken in the District of Maine, and roads as they were constructed in the surrounding country converged to it as a place of crossing. This gave to Augusta a central position and laid the foundation of much of her subsequent prosperity. According to a custom which prevailed of electing men who were engaged to be married or were newly married, Hog-reeves, James Bridge and Lewis Hamlen were this year honored, among others, with this office. In the next year John Davis, Church Wil liams and Jesse Bobinson were on the list, and the following year the Eev. Daniel Stone was of the number. But their sphere of operation was not extensive, as swine \"being ringed and yoked according to law\" were permitted to go at large, except within the limits of the \"gaol yard,\" which embraced at this time an area on the west side of the river between lots number five and eleven and half a mile from the river. In the next year a Pound was built \"on the west side of the gully near the gaol, on the north side of the Winthrop road.\" This was near the house of Joseph Anthony on Winthrop street, and the gully at this point, which was narrow and deep, passed where Winthrop Hall now stands, and a bridge crossed it in Winthrop street. The assent of the town, at the annual meeting, was asked but not obtained, to form the North parish into \"a distinct and separate town.\" A petition with order of notice from the \"General Court\" to form a Baptist society composed of some inhabitants of Augusta, Sidney and Belgrade, met with a like fate. That the town was engaged in the lumber trade is apparent from the fact that some of the highways were incumbered with \"wood, timber, shingles and other lumber\" to such an extent as \"in many instances to render them impassable with convenience and safety.\" This led to the adoption of a by-law to remedy the \" unreasonable practice.\" A road \"to Sidney in the route to Belgrade\" was accepted this year, and also one from \" Lyon's mill to Dutton's farm, and thence to Green Lodge.\" James Bridge the federal candidate for representative was elected this year over Nathan Weston his republican opponent, by a vote of seventy-eight to fifty. The next year the politics of the town were changed, and Weston prevailed against his competitor, Daniel"], [347, "1798. Military Spirit. \u2014 Neiv County. 315 Cony, by a vote of ninety-five to fifty-five. This change was prob ably owning to the measures which brought the administration of the elder Adams into disrepute. These were the sedition law which made it highly penal to defame the administration, and an alien law which authorized the President to order all foreigners out of the United States whom -he might consider dangerous to the public interest and safety. The army was enlarged, the navy in creased, privateering authorized, and merchantmen permitted to arm in self defence. To defray the increased expenses and pro vide for such exigences as might arise from the unsettled state of affairs with France, a stamp duty was imposed on parchment and paper, a land tax of $2,000,000 on the States, and a like sum authorized to be raised by loan. The treaties with France were declared by Congress to be no longer obligatory. The organiza tion and discipline which the militia were undergoing revived the military spirit of the country. In consequence of a letter from Gen. Dearborn, Gen. Sewall wore \"uniform dress on Sundays and other public occasions ;\" and he communicated his intention so to do, in a circular letter to the commandants of regiments and select corps in the second brigade commanded by him. On the following Sunday he attended meeting at his accustomed place at the Hook in uniform. He probably went on this occasion in \"Bond's\" or \"Hamlen's chaise,\" which he occasionally had, though not unfre quently he walked to meeting and sometimes went in a canoe. The increase in population and business which had t;iken place at this time in the northerly part of the county of Lincoln, de manded for its accommodation a new county. To effect this, the legislature authorized, by resolve, the towns within the county to assemble by delegates in convention to be held in Hallowell on the fourth Tuesday of October, for the purpose of agreeing upon lines of division.1 Daniel Cony was chosen by Augusta delegate to this convention. It assembled in the meeting-house in Hallowell on the 23d day of October, and numbered from forty to fifty members. The second day of its session \"the lines of division were amicably agreed upon, and a memorial drawn and signed\" by the members praying the legislature to establish a new county by the name of Kennebec.2 This prayer was granted on the twentieth of the fol lowing February, when the county of Kennebec was established, with Augusta for its shire-town, and two terms of the court of 1 Printed Resolve. * Sewall's Diary."], [348, "1799. Eire Engine. \u2014 Fire Company. 316 Common Pleas and Sessions, and one term of the Supreme Judicial Court were appointed to be held here annually. The four judges of the Court of Common Pleas of the new county were Joseph North and Daniel Cony of Augusta, and Nathaniel Dummer and Chandler Robbins of Hallowell. James Bridge of Augusta was appointed judge of probate ; John Davis of Augusta clerk of the courts, except the Sessions ; Barzillai Gannet of Pittston clerk of the Sessions ; Henry Sewall of Augusta register of deeds ; William Howard of Augusta county treasurer; Chandler Eobbins of Hallowell register of probate ; and Arthur Lithgow of Winslow sheriff. Fire wardens were first chosen at the annual meeting this year. They were Elias Craig, Theophilus Hamlen, Peter T. Vose, George Crosby, Samuel Howard, Jr. and Samuel Cony, 2d. During the year an engine \"for the purpose of extinguishing fires\" was provided, to manage which the selectmen by authority of law appointed a number of \"engine men,\" who were directed to choose such officers and make such regulations \"not repugnant to the constitution of the Commonwealth\" as should be necessary for their government. This first company of firemen appointed by the selectmen num bered thirteen. They were Theophilus Hamlen, Amos Bond, Lewis Hamlen, Daniel Hartford, Barnabas Lambard, Shubael Pitts, John Brooks, James Child, Perez Hamlen, Charles Gill, Joseph North, Jr., Samuel Page and Church Williams.1 Some years previous to this a private fire company was formed for mutual protection of its members against fire. They had printed articles of association, which required each member to keep ready for use two leathern fire buckets, and a canvas bag for the removal of goods at fires ; and the members at fires were first to render assistance to those of their associates who might need it. The principal citizens were members of this association and provided themselves witli the bag and from two to four leathern buckets, which were numbered and marked with their owners' names. They were of oblong shape with leathern handles, and were very durable and convenient to pass water. Leathern buckets for this purpose were in use at a very early day. At a \" session of the directors general and councillors held in Fort Amsterdam in New Netherlands,\" (now New York), December 15, 1 Original order of selectmen."], [349, "1800. Death of Washington. 317 1657, a tax was levied on \"every house, whether small or large, of one beaver or eight guilders in seawant \u2014 wampum \u2014 for the purpose of ordering two hundred and fifty leathern fire buckets from Fatherland,\" \"and out of the surplus to have made some fire ladders and fire hooks ;\" and in addition to this, once a year, to levy \" for every chimney one guilder for the support and main tenance of the same.\" New Netherlands had at this time \"flag roofs, wooden and platted chimneys,\" which they directed to be removed within four months.1 News of the death of Washington, which occurred on the 14th of December of the last year, did not reach Augusta until the first day of January of this year.2 His death was universally mourned. Nearly all classes wore crape on the left arm, and President Adams issued a proclamation recommending the observance of the 22d of February in commemoration of his death. The town assembled on the 6th of February in town meeting to consider this proclamation, when they chose Henry Sewall, Peter T. \"Vose, George Crosby, Samuel Colman, William Brooks, James Bridge and Benjamin Whitwell a committee of arrangements to prepare for a suitable observance of the day. Whitwell was selected to deliver an oration in the meeting-house ; and extensive prepara tions were made for an imposing demonstration by way of a pro cession. On the day appointed the people assembled in great numbers at the meeting-house, where the procession was formed in the following order : PROCESSION.

When it reached the meeting-house the young misses passed in, and that part which preceded the orator opened to the right and left, through which the remainder of the procession passed. The meeting-house was filled to overflowing. All could not obtain admittance. More than a thousand people were present. The services commenced with a funeral anthem. Kev. Daniel Stone made the introductory prayer, which was followed by singing an appropriate hymn with \"sadly pleasing melody.\" The oration was then delivered by Benjamin Whitwell. It \" exhibited in a masterly manner the moral, politi cal, and religious features of our departed Washington.\" The services ended with a prayer by the Rev. Eliphalet Gillett, the singing of an anthem, and a benediction from the Rev. Mr. Stone. The military companies then formed and marched off by the right, with unmuffled drums playing the President's March.1 The channel of the Kennebec between Augusta and Sheppard's wharf in Hallowell was crooked and obstructed by shoals which frequently changed during \" ice freshets,\" making this part of the river difficult of navigation. To remedy this William Howard and others, citizens of Augusta, petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation to clear the channel, and for the appointment of a harbor master. This was met by a remonstrance from the town of Hallowell,2 by the influence of which it was probably defeated.

Some of the citizens of the town alive to the agricultural inter ests of the new county met April 1st to form an agricultural society. The action of the meeting resulted in obtaining an act of incorporation for the Kennebec Agricultural Society, which held its first meeting March 12th of the following year, and con tinued its existence many years rendering valuable service to the agricultural interests of the county. The town was not represented this year in the legislature, as a vote of fifty-six to fifty-two was cafried in town meeting against sending a representative. Col. Arthur Lithgow, the sheriff of the county, moved from Winslow into the Peter Parker or Thomas Sewall house May 19th, and Parker and his family removed a few days after to Boston. The road now called Stone street was laid out this year, as also the road leading past the lower factory boarding-house to Bridge's Mills ; and Samuel Titcomb built a framed bridge across the gully on State street, south of the Man sion House, for which the town paid him $112.37. This was the first opening of State then called Court street.

The House of Rep resentatives, after more than thirty ballots, elected Mr. Jefferson from the two highest candidates, and Aaron Burr became Vice President. The first mention of a new route from Augusta to Portland we find in June of this year, when Gen. Sewall went on horseback through Wales and Bowdoin to Dean's ferry, where he crossed the Androscoggin to Durham, and thence proceeded to Chase's tavern in North Yarmouth, at Walnut hill, where he stopped over night and rode into town over Back Cove bridge next morning. In re turning he took \"the road through Brunswick, by advice of the marshal,\" lodged at Chase's at \"Flying Point,\" rode to Dunning's to breakfast, and \"proceeded over Brunswick bridge, by the most direct route through Topsham, Bowdoin and Litchfield to Hallo well, and reached home before sunset \" In November, he went and returned by way of Chandler's, in Monmouth. . The ice in the river was not passable this year till December 10th, and broke up on the 13th of the month. Rafts of lumber were run to Bath on the 25th, and the river did not again close till January 4th. The year 1801 opened under very favorable auspices for the country. Peace was re-established in Europe ; \"our ships visited every part of the world, and brought home the products of every country;\" shipbuilding, manufactures and mechanic arts were flourishing and gave an unusual stimulus to domestic industry. The interest of agriculture as well as manufactures was sought to be promoted by David Humphreys, our embassador to Spain, who imported one hundred Merino sheep of fleeces exceeding in weight and fineness any in the country. So highly were these esteemed that Merino bucks sold in 1802 for $300. In May, Judge Samuel Sewall while passing from the Rev. Mr. Stone's, where he boarded, to the court house, over the recently constructed road, now called Stone street, was precipitated with his horse and chaise off an unrailed bridge which crossed the gully near William Caldwell's house. The horse was killed and the chaise much damaged, but the judge escaped without injury. The bridge at this time was about fifteen feet high from the bottom of the gully. In September a meeting was called to consider the claim made for damage which was referred to the selectmen and"], [353, "1801. South Parish Difficulties. 321 town agent to adjust, and $500 were raised to repair the bridges in town. The disaffection in the South parish, which had for some time existed, was now greatly increased. At a meeting held in December of the past year to consider the expediency of petition ing the legislature \"to amend, repeal, or explain any of the sections in the acts\" dividing the town of Hallowell into three parishes and two towns, a committee consisting of Nathan Wes ton, Theophilus Hamlen, Joshua Gage, Seth Williams, Joseph North, Samuel Colman, James Child, Nathaniel Cummings and Salmon Rockwood was chosen to consider the subject, who re ported \"that the present difficulties of the parish are of such a nature that it will be for their interest not to petition the legisla ture at present to explain, amend or repeal any sections of the acts.\" This was accepted. But the difficulties were brought to a direct issue at a meeting held January 10th of this year, \"to see if the parish wish for the further continuance of the Rev. Daniel Stone among them as their minister,\" and to take measures to dis solve the \"civil contract\" with him. On this question the meet ing \"agreed to poll the house,\" when thirteen .were in favor of continuing Mr. Stone and twenty-six against it. A committee of the opposition, consisting of James Bridge, Samuel Colman, John Davis, Theophilus Hamlen and George Crosby was now chosen to confer and arrange with Mr. Stone for \"a dissolution of the civil contract.\" To this Mr. Stone seemed at first to have readily consented, but when a larger committee approached him to make definite arrangements, he said he would agree in calling a council \"if his church should approve the measure;\" and would ask a dismission, should a council recommend it, if the parish would submit to arbitrators \" what compensation they should make him for the injury he should sustain by a dissolution of his civil con tract;\" and that some responsible members of the parish should bind themselves to perform the award. These terms were not acceptable, and the parish voted unanimously not to call a council. The contract at this time between minister and people was con sidered of a permanent character, and not to be easily broken. If Mr. Stone was right in demanding compensation, security neces sarily followed, for with the facility of changing from parish to parish the burden of payment might fall wholly on his friends, or 21"], [354, "New Court House. 1801. 322 upon a parish with few or irresponsible parishioners. The move ment to dissolve the connection with Mr. Stone having failed, the disaffection in the parish increased to an alarming extent. In the following March sixty-seven certificates of \" parochial elections\" were filed with the town clerk,1 most of which were of changes from the South to the North parish. One of the certifi cates was signed by forty-five persons, among whom we find the names of James Bridge, Benjamin Whitwell, George Crosby, Wil liam Robinson, Joshua Gage, James Child, John Davis, Samuel Colman, Arthur Lithgow and Samuel Howard. Nathan Weston signed a certificate to the same effect, as did others. It is not surprising that under these circumstances \"Joseph North and others\" should have petitioned the legislature to change the bounds of the parish, probably so as to include the North parish, and to abolish the privilege of changing from one parish to another without a change of residence. This petition was pub lished in the Kennebec Gazette with order of notice from the legis lature, and the town at its May meeting instructed Nathan Wes ton, its representative that day chosen, \"to use his best endeavors\" to resist the petition ; and the parish at a meeting held the same month decided against a change in the bounds of the parish, and in favor of a repeal of the provisions in the act allowing parochial changes, expressing at the time the sentiment, that they had \" observed with concern too many instances wherein the indul gence allowed has been abused.\" Capt. Samuel Cony was chosen \" agent to attend the General Court for the purpose of obtaining an act to remedy the incon venience the parish labors under,\" and forty dollars were raised to defray the agent's expenses.2 The contest before the legisla ture, thus entered upon by the town and parish, resulted in abol ishing the abused privilege after a definite period. This we shall see, in the progress of events, led to further legislative action. The county commenced the erection of a new court house in June of this year, on the site of the present new jail. State street, then called Court street, had just been made passable to the south, by the erection of a framed bridge over the gully near the Mansion House. This house was built in the following year by Timothy Page for a hotel to accommodate attendants upon 1 Original certificates. 'Parish Records, p. 54."], [355, "1802. Federalism in Ascendency. 323 the courts. The present Court street was not laid out until 1803, and then only from State to Water street. The court house was finished on the 16th of March, 1802, and occupied by the Court of Common Pleas. However, religious services had occasionally been held in it during the preced ing winter by the North parish. It was a commodious building for that day, and served the county for nearly thirty years, after which, as private property, it was enlarged and became the place of worship of the second Baptist church, under the name of State Street Chapel. It subsequently was a place of public amusement, by the name of Concert Hall, and upon the erection of the new jail was removed to its present location north of the Mansion House, where it retains the last men tioned name. In November of this year, Joseph and' Hannah North gave to the inhabitants of the South parish about two acres of land for a parish burial-place. It was the lot now known as the old or \" Burnt Hill\" burying-ground on Winthrop street. Previously to this a few persons had been buried on their land where the town house was, and where Joseph Anthony's house now is, at the corner of Winthrop and Elm streets. The town elections in the spring of this year show, according to Gen. Sewall, that \"the federal fluid in the political thermome ter was rising.\" On the 5th of April the \" federal ticket for gov ernor was within three of the Jacobin \" or democratic ticket, and for lieutenant governor it had two majority. This was said to be \" owing to the late measures of the general government,\" which so rapidly increased the growing disaffection, that at the represent ative election, May 3d, Major Samuel Howard, the federal can didate, was chosen by the strong vote of ninety-three to forty seven for Nathan Weston and five for Samuel Titcomb, both democrats, and federalism was again in the ascendency in town. The North parish, strengthened by the large accession of resi dents of the South parish, sustained occasional preaching, by Rev. Jotham Sewall and Rev. Mr. Smith, at the new and old court house until May 6th, when the Rev. Mr. Robbins arrived and occupied the desk, at the old court house, \" as a candidate \" for settlement till the last of August, when he left, but after wards returned and officiated for two months at the same place. He exchanged with the Rev. Mr. Belden of Winthrop and the"], [356, "First Bell. \u2014 Squatters. 1802. 324 Rev. Mr. Gillet of Hallowell ; visited Gen. Sewall, who attended his meetings and said he \"preached to general acceptance.\" Of course he was a sound Calvinist. The first bell was brought into town by the county, this year, for the court house, which was then without belfry, and the Court of Sessions offered the use of the bell to the town and the South parish on certain conditions, which both declined, but subse quently, in December, the parish raised one hundred and fifty dollars \" to aid in building the tower of the court house for the purpose of hanging the bell provided for the county,\" and ap pointed Joseph North and John Davis \"to aid and advise with the committee appointed by the county for building the tower.\" The belfry was not erected till August of the following year, and on the tenth day of that month the bell commenced ringing at the hours of seven, one and nine o'clock daily. i Harmony of sound was probably promoted this jrear by the expenditure of thirty-five dollars raised \" for purchasing a bass viol for the use of the parish and building a box therefor.\" This was the first introduction of instrumental music in public worship in town. The viol was played by Stephen Jewett. The Kennebec proprietors were now anxious to divide their lands and close their affairs. Nathan Dane had made his report on titles in 1796, by which the proprietors at that period and the shares each was entitled to were ascertained, and measures had been taken to adjust any inequalities in divisions already made, with a view to the final settlement of the affairs of the company. Many settlers were upon their lands without title, which embar- si rassod the company, and they petitioned the General Court in January of this year asking for measures of relief. In their peti tion they say that \" many persons availing themselves of the absence and distance of the proprietors, and the opportunity afforded of secrecy by the unsettled state of the country,\" had intruded upon their lands and made improvements, until by their numbers they flattered themselves that they were too powerful to be removed by the regular authority of law, \"and in some instances alarming opposition had been made \" to persons acting for the proprietors, and \" to the hazard of the peace and quiet of that part of the State \" where the lands lay. In order to quiet these settlers and avoid the expense and irritation of actions of ejectment to remove them, with the \"almost certainty that the"], [357, "1802. Commissioners Appointed. 325 special aid of the government will be necessary to enforce the quiet execution of the laws,\"1 the proprietors asked -that they might be authorized, \" upon compromise,\" to confirm to persons in possession titles to cover their improvements, suggesting that doubts had arisen whether as tenants in common they could do this without legislative action. As a further proof of \"their equity and moderation,\" the peti tioners suggested the appointment of three commissioners by the legislature to inquire and determine on what terms the proprietors should quiet the settlers in their possessions, and gave assurance that they would comply with the decisions of the commissioners. This mode, which had been adopted in relation to settlers on the Waldo Patent, in 1797, with beneficial results, the proprietors were persuaded would have the happy effect, without injuring them in their \"substantial rights,\" of \"converting a great number of per sons into good citizens.\" 3 The legislature complied with the request of the company, and by resolve conferred the authority asked, and authorized the governor and council to appoint three commissioners by whom the appraisal of the lands was to be made and the terms of payment determined ; one half of the ex- pense of this commission was to be paid by the commonwealth and the other half by the proprietors. f Charles Vaughan of Hallowell was authorized by the company to give deeds to settlers \"on compromise ;\" and August 1, 1803, the commissioners having made their report, the company directed advertisements to be printed six weeks in the newspapers that they would execute deeds in accordance with the awards made. Those settlers only who accepted the provisions of the resolve by the fifth day of November 1802, were entitled to the benefit of its provisions, and the company petitioned the legislature for further extension,\" which was granted for one year. This was a measure of but partial relief, for litigation continued, creating bad feelings and a combination on the part of settlers to resist the laws, which culminated some years after in serious troubles. 1 Capt.

The company, under advice of eminent counsel, and in order to be fully prepared in the cases which were arising in court, on the sixth of August 1807, held a meeting, which was continued for six consecutive days, at which the records of the company from January 23, 1796 to July 13, 1807, were read and confirmed. The Bill of Rights of Massachusetts prohibited the legislature from making laws that should subject persons to \" infamous pun ishment, without trial by jury.\" But persons were liable to such punishments by the act of March 15, 1785, when convicted of certain crimes by a jury. For theft, a fine was inflicted \" not exceeding one hundred pounds or thirty-nine stripes,\" and a for feiture to the owner of \"treble the value of the goods or other articles stolen,\" and if the offender should be unable to make restitution or pay the treble value, the owner of the goods was entitled to dispose of the \"convict in service, to any person whom soever for such time as should be assigned by the court.\" For a second offence, the convict might in addition \"be set upon the gallows for the space of one hour with a rope about his neck and one end thereof thrown over the gallows.\" If the goods stolen amounted to three pounds he might be further sentenced to be branded with the letter T, on the right cheek, and be confined to hard! labor during his natural life, and wear a chain round his leg with a clog fastened to it. For burglary, the offender was liable to be branded on both cheeks with the letter B, in addition to the foregoing penalties.1 Under this infamous law Timothy Hill, a deaf and dumb man, was sentenced, this year, at the September term of the Su preme Judicial Court, at Augusta. He had stolen a consider able amount of goods from Pitts and Soule, and was sentenced to \"be set upon the gallows for the space of one hour with a rope about his neck and one end thereof cast over the gallows ;\" and to \"be severely whipped fifteen stripes, and pay the said Pitts and Soule twelve hundred dollars, treble the value of the goods stolen,\" and the record proceeds, \"if said Timothy be unable to pay the same, the said Pitts and Soule are authorized to dispose of the said Timothy in service to any person whomsoever for the term of twelve years.\" At the June term of the same court, in 1804, John Bisbee, convicted of fraud, was sentenced to \" set in the pillory for the space of one hour \" and to be impris- 1 Mass.

Eli Duce, for theft, at the same term was sentenced to sit upon the gallows one hour, and to be publicly whipped twenty stripes, and to pay the party injured treble the value of the goods stolen, and in default of payment to be sold to service for one year. At the June term, 1805, Samuel Uling-, who confessed to a charge of horse stealing, was sentenced to be whipped \"twenty stripes on the naked back,\" and failing to make restitution was to be sold to service for two years. Joseph Dor sey and Benjamin Austin were each sentenced, at the same term, for theft, to receive one twenty and the other thirty stripes on the naked back, and to sale for three years' service if they failed to restore three times the value of the property stolen.1 These were probably the last inflictions under this barbarous law in Kennebec, as it was repealed March 11, 1806, and from that time the cruelty of branding, sitting upon the gallows and whipping for crimes, forever passed away in the State. An association of citizens erected this year a \"Grammar School House\" of brick, on the northwest corner lot of Bridge and State streets. Bridge street did not at this time, and for many years after, extend west of State street. The school-house was com pleted in the spring of 1804, when Mr. Cheney was engaged as preceptor, for one year, at a salary of four hundred and fifty dol lars. This was the first effort to establish a school above the grade of public schools. Individual interest in the association was rep resented by shares, which entitled the holder to send one scholar for each share, and shares were sometimes let to accommodate those who had none. The languages were taught at this school. which continued to flourish until the destruction of the house by fire, on the 16th of March, 1807. The first dwelling erected on Judge North's land, on the hill, between Winthrop street and the Grammar School-house, was built this year by Lot Hamlen. It was the house long occupied by the Jate Greenwood C. Child, and which the late Dr. J. W. Ellis pur chased and remodeled. It is now owned by Artemas Libby. The Cushnoc House was built the same season by Amos Part ridge for a store and dwelling. John Partridge traded in the store part in company with Kendall Nichols, father of the late Asaph R. Nichols. It was comparatively a small building at the time, and 1 Records Sup. Jud.

At this time, the Lombardy poplar was a favorite ornamental tree, and was extensively planted over the country.- On each side of State street, which had been recently opened, they were planted from Bridge street to the brickyard at the southerly end of Grove street, and long waved their tall and graceful forms to the breeze. The last of the rows, near the brickyard, disappeared within a few- years. Joseph Burton, a brother of James, was a tobacconist, and! occupied at this time the old Hamlen store, which stood between the court bouse and the Hamlen house, at the entrance of the Dickman lane from Winthrop street. He had an Indian painted as large as life for a sign.

Edes lost his printing press aud a large part of his; furniture. This caused him to suspend the printing of the Ken nebec Gazette for a time, and while he was in Boston making arrangements to resume, some of the leading democrats were busy in obtaining subscriptions for the \"Argus,\" which had just beeu started in Portland.1 The first number of the Gazette issued after the fire is dated March 23d. In it the editor says, \" the political complexion\" of the paper \" shall be such as to merit the approba tion of every friend of the federal cause.\" It seems the effort to circulate the Argus had some effect on bis subscription list, as in September following he consoled himself with the reflection that \"he has got rid of almost all his bad paymasters since the estab lishment of the Argus in Portland,\" aud he would not be under 1 Sewall's Diary. \"First number of Eastern Argus issued Sept. 1, 1803."], [361, "1804.

It was the first banking institution estab lished on the Kennebec, and the fifth in the District of Maine. Portland at this time had two, the Portland Bank incorporated June 15, 1799, and the Maine Bank incorporated June 23, 1802; Wiscasset one, the Lincoln and Kennebec Bank incorporated June 23, 1802 ; and Pepperelborough one, the Saco Bank incorporated March 8, 1803. The Lincoln and Kennebec Bank was designed to accommodate Lincoln and Kennebec counties, and the leading men in each county were named in its act of incorporation. James Bridge, Samuel Howard and Daniel Cony were corporators, and other citizens of Augusta, upon its organization, became interested in its stock.- A director was usually elected from the Augusta stockholders, and one from the Hallowell. The former, this year, was Arthur Lith gow, the latter John 0. Page. Wiscasset was without a news paper, and the notification of the first meeting was required by the charter to be given \"in the paper printed by Edes, in the county of Kennebec, and Jenks' Portland Gazette.\" The corporators of the Hallowell and Augusta Bank were chiefly citizens of the two places, with a few Bath and Wiscasset names. The bank was located at Hallowell, with a capital of two hundred thousand dollars, and was prohibited from issuing bills of less denomination than five dollars. It was required to appropriate one eighth part of its whole funds \" to loans to be made to citizens of the commonwealth, not resident in the town of Hallowell,\" for the purpose of promoting the interest of agriculture. These loans were to be made in sums not less than one hundred, nor more than five hundred dollars, \"and upon the personal bond of the borrower, with collateral security, by sufficient mortgage of real estate, for a term not less than one year.\" This provision, de signed to foster agriculture by loans to farmers, was in the charters of the previously mentioned banks. The corporators of the Hallowell and Augusta Bank met on the 6th of July, at the house of John Sewall, innholder, in Hallowell, for the purpose of organizing. A struggle which commenced in the legislature between Hallowell and Augusta for the location of the institution, was now renewed for its organization. So nearly"], [362, "Fourth of July Celebrated. 1804. 330 balanced were the parties, that each at first claimed to have elected the chairman of the meeting. However, the Augusta party pre vailed. Judge Cony was chosen chairman, and Reuel Williams secretary. Judge Bridge was elected president, but did not act long, if at all. John 0. Page was elected, and ever after during the life of the corporation continued its president. Jeremiah Dummer was the first and only cashier.1 This bank was of great advantage to the Hook, adding much to its importance as a place of business. During the troublesome times preceding the war of 1812 it failed, with a large amount of bills in circulation. An effort was made to hold the stockholders. Reuel Williams brought a hundred actions against them on its bills, at one term of the court; but the books and papers of the bank had dis appeared and could not be found, and proper proof could not be made of ownership of stock. Dummer, the cashier and rightful custodian of the books, knew nothing of them \"of his own know ledge.\" He could only testify to what he had heard, but hearsay was not permitted, and the bills became worthless.2 The \"Federal citizens\" assembled on the 4th of July to com memorate the day. The dawn was ushered in by discharge of caiftion. A procession was formed at the court house, and after crossing the river and returning, proceeded to the meeting-house, when \"a chaste and spirited oration,\" which was afterwards pub lished, was delivered by H. Weld Fuller, \"a young lawyer,\" who was admitted to practice during the following month. After the oration the company partook of a \"handsome repast\" at Jones' hall, in the Kennebec House, and drank seventeen regular toasts highly seasoned with federalism. The democrats, at the same time listened to an oration from the Rev. Thurston Whiting, at the court house. Amos Pollard disposed of his public house in 1797 to Peter T. Vose, who removed it from the eight rod road, now Market square, in which it was built, and enlarged it to the dimensions of the Kennebec House, finishing the end on Water street for a store, which he occupied. The house part was kept as a tavern by Wil liam Stanley and Isaac Stone. The next year Jesse Robinson took Stone's place, and Stanley & Robinson conducted the house.

Whitwell's office ; that the copartnership between Seth Currier, William Bridge and James Bridge, at Canaan, under the name of Currier, Bridge & Co. was dissolved ; that Howard & Cony paid cash for \"well furred bearskins;\" that Eveleth & Dutch gave cash for furs at their store; and that Seth Hallowell was in jail, and in- formed his creditors \" that he intended shortly to swear out.\" The Hallowell academy was destroyed by fire on the night of the 29th of January. Measures were immediately taken to re build it of enlarged dimensions, and the school was continued in John Sewall's house. John and Joshua Gage had built a wharf, in the rear of their store adjoining the town landing, and in order to facilitate access to it they asked of the town the privilege of erecting a wharf on the town landing, which after consideration by a committee was granted upon certain conditions and reservations. The selectmen were authorized, March 11th, to procure a house for the accommodation of the poor of the town. The three phy sicians, Drs. Winship, Cony and Colman were appointed a com mittee to examine Dr. Ariel Mann's bill against the town. Crows were outlawed this year and a bounty of twenty-five cents offered for the heads of those a year old, and half that sum for younger ones, killed within the town. Joshua Gage was elected representative ; he had one hundred and fourteen votes to one hundred and eleven for Seth Williams \u2014 and Nathan Weston was elected senator, and was a member of the democratic council furnished the federal governor Strong. A project was started this year to erect a bridge over the Ken nebec on both sides of Swan island. A petition for this purpose was presented by Elihu Getchell and sixty-three others to the legislature, which ordered notice by publication in the Eastern Repository, printed at Wiscasset, and the Kennebec Gazette.

The first stage which came to Augusta was started by Col. T. S. Estabrook of Brunswick. In February of this year he informed the public that he had \" commenced running a mail stage from Brunswick to.Augusta twice a week;\" that it left Brunswick on Saturdays and Tuesdays, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and arrived at Augusta on Sundays and Wednesdays at ten o'clock ; left Augusta on Sunday at noon, and on Thursday at eight o'clock in the morning, and arrived at Brunswick on Monday at eight in the morning, and Thursday at five in the afternoon.1 The route at tin's time was through \"Purgatory\" in Litchfield, and came into the river road at Loudon hill in Hallowell. From thirteen to twenty-three hours was required for a transit, which is made in the public conveyance of the present day in an hour and a half Col. Estabrook carried the mail, over the same route on horseback for the first time in 1802 ; previous to that time it came by the way of Monmouth. Peter Oilman, who still carried the mail from Augusta to Nor ridgewoek, informed the public in June, \"that he leaves Norridge woek with a stage on Monday and Thursday\" at six o'clock in the morning, and arrives at Hallowell the evening of the same day at seven. John Blake, Meshach W. Blake and Levi Moody com menced running the first line of stages \"from Hallowell to Port land by Augusta, Monmouth and New Gloucester\" in January 1807. Stages of this line left Hallowell every Monday and Friday morn ings at four o'clock, and arrived at Portland the same evening at seven.2 The seceding members of the South parish, who were \"gentle men residing- within the parish but not members thereof,\" commu nicated to the parish in May 1803 \"certain proposals\" in writing - Kennebec Gazette, Jan. 0, 1807. 1 Kennehec Gazette, Feb. 1806."], [366, "New Meeting-House . 1806 334 tending to a reconciliation. A meeting was called to consider them, but the attendance was so small that the meeting was ad journed and finally ended without action. No other effort is known to have been made for a reconciliation of the troubles which still existed. At this time the right to change from one parish to another had probably expired by limitation, and with it returned the right of taxation, a claimed grievance, which subsequently called for and obtained relief by legislative action. Considering the weakness arising from the division which existed it was a bold measure at this time to undertake an expensive house of public worship, for which incipient measures were adopted during the year. The enterprise of building the new meeting house, great as it was and difficult to accomplish as it must have been, was managed with such wisdom and consummate ability as eventually to contribute, in no small degree, to bring about a reconciliation and restore harmony to the parish. In its success and results it must be viewed as one of the most creditable events in the history of the town. At a parish meeting held April 21. 1806, it was voted \"That the parish deem it proper and expedient to have a new meeting house erected for the accommodation of the first Congregational society in the South parish, and that the same be undertaken when a convenient site shall be obtained and accepted by the parish, and other necessary arrangements agreed on relative to the dimensions of the house, and a fund provided for the purpose.\" Daniel Cony, Joseph North, William Brooks, Seth Williams, Elias Craig, Solomon Vose and Thomas Bowman, were appointed to procure a suitable lot of land, make a plan of the house and esti mate its probable expense. Theophilus Hamlen, who was at one time a seccder, and Peter T. Vose were afterwards added to this committee. The committee reported August 11th, that the house should be 'about eight}' feet long by sixty feet wide;\" the probable ex pense of which would be $8,000 ; that funds be raised by sale of pews ; and that a lot of land, belonging to Joseph North, near the grammar school house, on the east side of the street leading to the court house \"from its central situation and elevated prospect\" would be most suitable for a site. Judge North proposed to sell this lot, eight rods by twenty-four, for \" one thousand dollars,\" or to give it \"in exchange for the old meeting-house,\" the parish to I"], [367, "1806.

The report was accept ed, and Peter T. Vose, Solomon Vose and Samuel Cony were chosen a building committee, and were directed to make sale of the pews, a plan of which was to be accepted by the parish previous to the sale. The same committee at a subsequent meeting presented a plan. dated November 1.7, 1806, which was adopted, and the committee, which proved to be very efficient, were clothed \"with such dis cretionary power \" in erecting the building \"as to them should appear necessary to carry the object into effect.\" When a fund arising from the sale of pews should amount to $10,000, they were to proceed without delay to erect the building on the most ele vated part of the lot offered by Judge North. An addition to the lot on the north side was subsequently made of one acre pur chased of Elias Craig at $150, and of a strip three rods wide on the south side purchased of Judge North. The building committee, on the 12th of May, 1807, reported to the parish that they had made \" contracts for a considerable part of the materials \" for the house, and had \"engaged workmen to commence the business\" of erecting the building \"in a few days.\" A question had arisen in relation to \"fronting\" the house, which was decided by a vote of the \"proprietors of pew ground.\" Theophilus Hamlen was appointed to superintend the practical operation of building at two dollars and a half per day. This year Robinson & Crosby, who were doing a large busi ness in the \" old castle,\" built the block of two brick stores which stood on Water street at the northeast corner of Market square. They were the first brick stores built in town. The same year they constructed the wharf in the rear, and occupied both for a few years, until the difficulties of the times compelled them to retire from business. Capt. James Purrinton of Bowdoinham moved to Augusta in August, 1805, and settled on a farm on the Belgrade road, now owned and occupied by George Cony. His father had deceased leaving him \" a handsome patrimony,\" and he was considered \" a rich and independent farmer.\" At this time he was forty-six years of age, and had a wife who, before marriage, was Betsey Clifford of Bath. She was an amiable woman of forty-five. Their"], [368, "1806. 336 Purrinton Tragedy. children were Polly, aged nineteen ; James, seventeen ; Martha, fifteen; Benjamin, twelve ; Anna, ten ; Nathaniel, eight ; Nathan, six ; and Louisa, eighteen months. Purrinton was of grave countenance, reserved manners, and \"obstinately tenacious of his opinion.\" ne frequentlj', however, changed his religious sentiments, and finally became a believer in the doctrine of universal salvation ; was said to be kind and affec tionate in his family and an obliging neighbor. He was observed at times to be elated or depressed as his affairs were prosperous or otherwise. He was greatly despondent on account of the drought of this year, and expressed fears that his crops would be cut off, his cattle starve, and his family suffer from want. But fears were not entertained by his neighbors, to whom he had ex pressed his feelings, that he meditated violence. However, on the morning of the ninth of July they were alarmed by an occurrence which has seldom been equalled in tragic horror. Purrinton, be tween two and three o'clock in the morning, attacked his sleeping family with an axe, and killed and mangled in a manner too shock ing to relate, his wife and six children, wounded two others, and then with a razor cut his own throat. Of a family of nine persons seven were killed. James, awakened by the piercing cries of his mother leaped from his bed and ran to the door of his apartment, where he was met by his father with axe in hand, who struck him, but so near was he that the axe passed over his shoulder inflicting a slight wound in his back. One or two blows, by the light of the moon which shone brightly, followed, but without effect. His younger brother, who slept with him, at this moment came up to pass out. He was assaulted and killed, and James escaped through a back door. Martha, the surviving daughter, was \"desperately wounded.\" She was awakened by the blows which killed her sister who was in bed with her. Terrified, she endeavored to shield herself with the bed clothes, but received two blows on the head and one on the arm which left her senseless. James, upon escaping, flew to Dean Wyman's, a near neighbor, and related in an \"incoherent manner\" the horrid scene. Wyman, with Jona than Ballard, who lived at a short distance, repaired to Purrin ton's house and found Martha alive, but so frightened \"that she scarcely dare breathe.\" They removed her on a bier to Ballard's house, where after lingering three weeks she died of her wounds, July 30th."], [369, "1806. Purrinton Tragedy. 337 Elias Craig, as coroner, immediately summoned a jury of in quest, of which John Eveleth was foreman. Frederic Wingate alone of the panel is now (1863) alive.1 On Sunday, three days before the fatality, it appeared that Pur rinton sharpened a knife and stood before a looking-glass in presence of his daughter, apparently preparing his throat for its use. This so alarmed her that he calmly replied to her terrified questions and laid the knife aside. The mother, upon her return from meeting being informed of the incident and that he had writ ten a letter previous to sharpening the knife, was filled with the most alarming apprehensions. Search was made among his papers and a letter found addressed to his brother in which he said, \"I am going on along journey,\" and gave directions as to the disposition of his property and the education of his children, enjoining him \"to be sure to give them learning if it takes all \u2014 divide what is left, for I am no more.\" This so overcame his wife that \"she was wretched and inconsolable.\" He endeavored to allay her fears by the most positive assurance that he did not meditate suicide, but at.the same time informed her that he had a presentiment that his death was near. Towards the close of the day preceding the assault he sharpened the fatal axe, but spent the evening as usual with the family, and when James retired he left his father reading the bible, which was found on the table next morning open at the ninth chapter of Ezekiel. It is said that hereditary insanity existed in his family, and that probably a sudden \" frenzy \u2014 an in explicable impulse of a disordered mind,\" instigated the deed. However, the jury found that Purrinton \"of his malice afore thought\" did kill and murder his wife and children, \"and as a felon did voluntarily kill and murder himself.\" After the jury had ended the examination, on the day of the tragedy, the selectmen took charge of the bodies, and in the even ing conveyed them to the meeting-house, placing the corpse of Purrinton in the porch with the fatal axe and razor on the coffin : the others were laid in the body of the house. The next day \" a vast concourse of people\" from the surrounding country attended the funeral.

Militia Companies. 338 ing houses were filled, and many were on the house tops.1 A stage was erected in Market square in front of the meeting-house, from which, after a prayer by the Rev. Daniel Stone, a sermon was preached by the Rev. Joshua Taylor, a Methodist minister. A procession was then formed in which the remains of the mother and her children, \"supported by bearers and attended by pall holders,\" were preceded by the coroner and jury of inquest and followed by the surviving son and other relations with the citizens. The body of Purrinton, drawn upon a cart, closed the proces sion, which crossed Kennebec bridge and returned, then moved by way of Bridge and State streets to the Burnt hill burying grouud, in the northeast corner of which the mother and children were buried. Services were performed at the graves by the Rev. Samuel Haskell, an Episcopal clergyman from Gardiner. The body of the homicide was further distinguished from the others by being buried with the axe and razor, without ceremony, in the highway near the southeast corner of the burying-ground, at the corner of Winthrop and High streets. The procession then returned to the meeting-house, where the .assembled multitude were dismissed after prayer by the Rev. Eliphalet Gillet.2 It was feared that the wars in Europe, prevailing at this time, might drive the United States from a position of neutrality which was yielding rich returns to her commerce, and measures were taken for defence ; and a military spirit, engendered by increased attention to military organization and discipline, was fostered in view of a probable rupture in the peaceful relations of the country. The military companies of Augusta, of which there were now two, were well equipped and under efficient discipline. One of them had been commanded in 1796, and for some years after, by Capt. Seth Williams. He was succeeded by Capt. Samuel Cony, who had been promoted, and Capt. Shubael Pitts was now in com mand. The other company was under command of Capt. Thomas Pitts.

A call was made, on the 28th of Feb ruary, in the Kennebec Gazette, on \"gentlemen of military taste and talent who are fond of the manly and honorable exercise of arms,\" to meet at the court house for the purpose of organizing such a company. At the time appointed some of the choice military spirits of the town assembled and formed a company by the name of the Augusta Light Infantry. Solomon Vose was chosen captain ; Amos Partridge lieutenant ; Peter T. Vose ensign ; Joseph Wales first sergeant; John Partridge second sergeant; James Williams third sergeant ; and Cyrus Alden fourth sergeant. Stephen Jew ett was fifer, and Lorain Judkins drummer. The rank and file on the inspection roll of the next year, numbered thirty ;' among whom we find the names of many who afterwards became promi nent citizens. This was the first independent company formed in Augusta, and it became famous for its discipline and martial bearing. Capt. Vose, its commander, was a gentleman of military taste and a proficient in military science. He prepared and riublished a manual of infantry exercise, on the basis of Stuben's, containing some new evolutions and man\u0153uvres \"as performed by the Augusta Light Infantry ;\" this work was mainly for the instruc tion of his company.

In the evening a \" splendid ball\" was given by the brothers of Miss Williams. The Gazette speaks of the day as one of \"hilarity and flow of soul,\" and says of the review that \"few events since the settlement of our country have been so replete with moments of feeling and satisfaction.\""], [373, "1806. National Troubles. 341 The country was, at this time, divided as to the policy which should be pursued towards France and Great Britain, the two principal nations engaged in the European war. The federalists were charged with favoring the British, and the democrats the French. Each had made aggressions on our commerce, which were palliated by one party and magnified by the other. The government was long suffering, and anxious to maintain a neu trality with both as a sure means of promoting the interest of our extensive and increasing- commerce. But at length the impress ment of our seamen and insults to our flag induced Congress, as a measure of retaliation, to prohibit the importation from Great Britain of various manufactured articles. This tended to increase the aggressions of the British. They seized merchant vessels under trivial pretexts, and aroused the indignation of the country by the Leander, an English vessel of war, firing into a coaster entering New York harbor, and killing a seaman ; and the flagrant outrage committed by the Leopard upon the Chesapeake, a national vessel, in our own waters, created an outburst of public feeling and indignation such as was seldom witnessed in the country. In November, Bonaparte issued his celebrated decree blockading the British islands and interdicting commerce with them. This was retaliated in the succeeding January, by British orders in council, which complicated our affairs with the belliger ents and came near involving us in war. The month of January 1807 was extremely cold. The Gazette records the temperature as below zero for seven days of the last of the month, as follows : the 20th at 22\u00b0 below, 21st at 18\u00b0 below, 22d at 24\u00b0 below, 23d at 32\u00b0 below, 26th at 16\u00b0 below, and 27th at the extreme point of 34\u00b0 below. February 1st there was a change of weather with rain, which raised the mill brook so rapidly that Bond's mill was carried away. Oil the 16th of the same month the water rose in the river, by ice jamming, to within a foot of the sill of Gen. Sewall's house, and on the 20th it rose a foot higher than the highest known for many years. The selectmen were authorized, last year, to \"contract for a house for the poor of the town, in a sum not exceeding $300,\" and George Read was, at the annual meeting of this year, elected \"Superintendent of the Town's Poor House.\" The town of Hal lowell, now that arrangements were made to erect a new house for"], [374, "342 Events. 1807. public worship, asserted claim to the old meeting-house, and a committee of three legal gentlemen, James Bridge, Benjamin Whitwell and Solomon Vose was appointed to inquire into the claim and report. A committee was also raised to consider the best means to secure the town's powder, which had heretofore been kept in the attic of the meeting-house, which was probably the most secure place, as fire was never permitted within its walls. The separation of the District of Maine from Massachusetts was again before the town this year, when the decisive vote of one hundred and twenty against forty-six in favor was given. During the past and present year an unusual degree of pros perity attended the town. This appeared in increased activity in business and additions to the business men of the place. Josiab H. Vose, a brother of Solomon Vose, opened a store next door south of the Kennebec tavern, that \"noted and well accustomed house,\" which was now kept by Joseph Burton, and had at this time four rooms on the lower floor, a \"spacious hall and eight sleeping chambers.\" Luther Farrell had opened a \"cheap cash store,\" an adventure which soon ended, as we are informed a few months after that Samuel Bond removed to the \"remarkable cheap store lately occupied by Luther Farrell.\" Dr. Sterne occupied the shop in the second story of the Gage store with \"an extensive assort ment of drugs, medicines and surgical instruments.\" Nathaniel Thwing, the itiueraut tailor of former days, had given place to the firm of Jonas Child & Co., who located and established themselves in the tailoring business \" next door to Whitwell & Fuller's office.\" John Eveleth and Greenwood C. Child had formed a copartner ship, and taken the Gage store recently vacated by Samuel Bond. J. & E. B. Williams had erected an expensive blacksmith shop opposite the bakery of T. W. Smith, at the foot of Court street, where they carried on the blacksmith business. John Brewster, portrait and miniature painter, had arrived in town and was stop ping at the Kennebec tavern, to paint in unfading colors the faces which King, his predecessor, had taken in profile. Robert C.Vose, secretary of the managers, gave notice of the \"Augusta Assem blies\" at Burton's hall. The Kennebec Agricultural Society met, April 13th, at the dwelling of Joseph North, by previous appointment, and chose Joseph North president; Nathaniel Dummer and Robert Page"], [375, "1801 Fourth of July Celebrated. 343 vice presidents; Daniel Cony treasurer; H. Sewall recording sec retary ; James Bridge and John Merrick corresponding secretaries ; Charles Vaughan, Rev. D. Stone, Rev. E.

Benjamin Vaughan, John Merrick and James Bridge were chosen a standing committee to address the farmers of the county \"oa, the general subject of agriculture.\" John Merrick, of this committee, on the 19th of June addressed the farmers, through the Gazette, on the subject of increasing food for cattle and how to use it with the most economy. He recommended the sowing of oats to be cut in the milk, and plant ing corn to be cut for fodder, also the raising of potatoes, carrots and turnips, and gathering and preserving leaves of forest trees to be fed to cattle. The economical preparation of food, such as grinding and soaking grain and chopping straw was recommended. He remarked, \" hay is now dearer in Kennebec than in London, the capital city of a luxurious nation,\" and recommended stacking hay and building barns to preserve it in years of plenty for years of scarcity. \"New measures,\" he said, \" are required from the repeated scarcity lately occurring in our food for horses and cattle.\" The Kennebec Medical Association was, in May, called at the house of Gershom North, innholder. This inn was the Mansion House, which was at the time owned and occupied by him. The republicans were now in high spirits on account of the election of Sullivan as governor, and June 1st rang the bell and fired cannon from \"before sunrise till after twelve o'clock\" at noon. They also celebrated the 4th of July by an oration de livered in the meeting-house, by the Rev. Joshua Cushman of Winslow, and a dinner provided for a hundred and fifty persons, in the court house which was adorned with flags, evergreens and flowers. Cushman's oration was published in pamphlet form, and as it attacked federalism with more vigor of denunciation than truthfulness or discretion, it was reviewed at length by a corre spondent in the Gazette, who noticed some errors of fact as well as of composition, which \" a friend of Cushman \" endeavored to fix on its federal printer. The \" federal republicans \" probably celebrated at Hallowell, where an oration was delivered by Jeremiah Perley. The Augusta Light Infantry paraded in honor of the day. After marching and"], [376, "Patriotism of Light Infantry. 1807. 344 counter-marching and performing various evolutions, they drew up \"on the Kennebec bridge,\" where the company \"discharged eighteen rounds\" of musketry, and then proceeded to \"Pollard's hotel\" where an \"elegant dinner\" was provided for them, at which they sung among other songs one rejoicing in their free- fitdom from party strife. The half of one stanza read as follows : No discord here shall mar our joys, No party feud our board controls, No jarring thought our glee alloys, We all are sons of freeborn souls.\" The election of James Sullivan, the democratic candidate for governor, by a decisive majority, after a warm contest, which resulted in every branch of the government becoming democratic, was not owing to a great change in the politics of the State, as Caleb Strong, the federal governor of the previous year, was barely elected by the people ; and the lieutenant governor and the council were democratic. But partizan feeling, which was active and intolerant, soon became embittered by the obnoxious measures of President Jefferson's administration. The President of the United States required the executives of the several States to raise their respective quotas of 100,000 men, to be organized and held in readiness for the defence of the coun try, and Gov. Sullivan issued his orders of September 14th requir ing detachments of the militia for this purpose. This measure became necessary from the aggressions of both France and Eng land on our commerce. Previous to the issuing of division orders by Major General Sewall for a detachment of 1311 men, including officers, from the eighth division of the militia under his command, in response to Gov. Sullivan's requisition, the Augusta Light Infantry, by Solomon Vose their captain, tendered their services to the governor. Capt. Vose in a letter to Gen. Sewall filled with patriotic sentiment, said, they \" do not wait for a cold and formal detachment of their men ; they hasten to tender their unanimous services in the cause of their country ; they are ready for action ; they seize the first instant to enter into engagements with arms and equipments com plete, at a moment's warning to march under the orders of their superiors.\" * * * \"While they cannot but deeply regret the cause which induces this offer they hope, should the opportunity finally present itself, they may be found faithful to"], [377, "1807.

Some light is thrown on their condition by a poetical epistle to which they resorted to obtain something to regale themselves with on Thanks giving day. It was addressed to the sheriff of the county, as follows : Prisoners' Petition. To his Honor, the Sheriff of Kennebec county, We, Petitioners, Solicit your generous bounty.

In a brief message to Congress, on the 18th of December, President Jefferson, after stating \"the great and increasing dan gers with which our vessels, our seamen, and merchandise are threatened on the high seas, and elsewhere, from the belligerent powers of Europe, and it being of great importance to keep in safety these essential resources,\" recommended \"an inhibition of the departure of our vessels from the ports of the United States.\" Congress discussed the recommendation three days, in secret session, and against the vehement protests of the federalists, who said \"it was a slavish submission to the mandates of the French emperor,\" passed on the twenty-second day of December, an act laying an embargo on vessels in the harbors of the United States. This ruinous measure, which gave up all foreign trade and forbade foreign ships to load with our produce, at once prostrated the business of the country and produced wide-spread distress ; par ticularly burdensome and ruinous was it to New England. After a continuance of fourteen months the embargo was superceded by non-intercourse with Great Britain and France, which was a measure of partial relief to the distressed country. The raising of the new meeting-house, in the South parish, was commenced on the fourteenth of July 1807, and finished on the eighteenth. Previous to this, \"James Bridge, Benjamin Whitwell and others\" petitioned the legislature to \"incorporate them and their associates into a religious society by the name of the Third Religious Society in Augusta, with such privileges and immuni ties as shall be deemed proper and just.\" In this petition, upon which notice was ordered June 19th, they represent that, \"in consequence of the right of seceding from one parish to unite with another, less opposition was excited to the settlement of their present minister than would otherwise have arisen ;\" that a majority of the parish was dissatisfied with him in 1801, and"], [379, "1807. Parish Meeting. \u2014 Remonstrance. 347 desired and proposed a dissolution of the ministerial connection on just and equitable terms, which were not accepted, but terms of adjustment were proposed which were \"deemed unreasonable\" by the parish ; \" that the consequences of division have been, and still continue to be, injurious to the best interests of the inhabit ants ;\" that there has not been a meeting-house or settled minis ter in the North parish, with which most of the petitioners are con nected ; that they reside at so great distance from the usual places of worship in that parish and the parish in Hallowell, that some are unable and many indisposed to attend ; \"whereby the habit of neglecting this important duty is greatly increased,\" which \"has conduced to deprave the morals and manners of the community;\" and \"that the wealth and population of the parish have more than doubled since the ordination of their present minister.\" ' The parish assembled December 14th to consider the subject of this petition, when it was referred to a committee, who reported on the eleventh day of the following month, \"that it would be expedient for the parish to forward a respectful remonstrauce and representation to the legislature in reply\" thereto, \"expressive of the injurious consequences apprehended by the parish from having so many of its members separated therefrom.\" This report was accepted, and Daniel Cony, Joseph North, Peter T. Vose, Seth Williams, Robert Williams, Solomon Vose, Thomas Bowman, Thomas Bond and Isaac Carter were appointed a committee to draft and forward to the representative of the town and senators from the county a remonstrance.2 In this remonstrance the committee did not assume \"to decide on the wisdom, integrity or propriety of the petition,\" although they say reasons and considerations \"of a doubtful tendency, accompanied with certain statements not correctly ascertained \" appear therein. Their \" apology for troubling\" the legislature is in \" considerations which regard the general interest of society, and the peculiar situation of the parish.\" They further say, \"it is to be regretted, that some of those persons who have seceded from the parish, still remain uneasy and dissatisfied with their situation,\" and aver that the twenty-five votes thrown in 1801 against the minister, were not a third part of the votes of the parish ; they inquire in relation to the divisions, \" whether the un pleasant results do not admonish us to unite and hold together in 'Petition in Kennebec Gazette, July 3, 1807. * Parish Records, p. 101."], [380, "Petition for a Council. 1808. 348 support of the civil and religious interests of the parish ;\" and remark \" that all good men will feel a sincere regret when they learn from the declaration of the petitioners that neglect to attend the important duty of public worship should have conduced to deprave their morals and manners,\" at a time when \"there were two respectable public teachers,\" officiating statedly \"in their vicinity.\" They conclude by remarking of the parish, \"that it yet remains small to compose one parish,\" which is engaged in building a meeting-house, and that the petitioners should not be let off without paying their proportion of the debts and liabilities incurred.1 At the same meeting Theophilus Hamlen and nine others petitioned the parish to join in a mutual council with the Rev. Mr. Stone, \" respecting the disagreeable situation and difficulties subsisting between them and their minister.\" This was referred to a committee, which reported January 25th, that having given notice to the petitioners, they were met by three of them, \"but one of whom, upon conference, was in favor of a council, and his arguments were drawn from the expediency of the measure, grounded on the idea that a great majority of the inhabitants, living within the territory of the parish, were opposed to Mr. Stone ; respecting this, the committee have no data, as they have had no communication with the disaffected without the parish.\" This class were not willing to bear their proportion of the expense of an \"experiment,\" as summoning a council was called. \"It must first be agreed that Mr. Stone shall be removed before they will obligate themselves to join in the expense that may be incurred.\" It was then inquired, what was the cause of complaint against Mr. Stone ; there was no allegation against his moral character, it was agreed that was unimpeachable and truly amiable. It was not pretended that he had changed his religious sentiments and preached different doctrines from those he avowed in a \" state of probation;\" nor was it hinted that he had in any way forfeited his ministerial character. Though frequently pressed on the subject, Mr. Hamlen, \"the organ of the disaffected,\" would assign no cause of complaint against Mr. Stone, either as a minister or a man. The committee \" regretted that this root of bitterness should exist in the parish,\" 1 Remonstrance in Gazette January 22, 1808."], [381, "1808. Third Religious Society. 349 and remarked that \"they should shudder at tbe idea of separation\" from their minister, and \"doubted if the parish would be sufficiently united to settle a successor for many years.\" They hoped the \"unfounded prejudice and bitterness without a cause would soon vanish,\" and that they might become a \"united and happy people.\" This report was signed by Joseph North, Solomon Vose, William Brooks, Thomas Bowman and Isaac Carter.1 The meeting then adopted the following preamble and vote : \"Whereas certain persons within the parish who do not hear Mr. Stone, have at times disturbed the peace and harmony of the parish,\" Therefore: Voted, \"When they shall unite in a minister of the Congregational order of sound principles and good character, that said minister may be settled as a colleague with Mr. Stone, with the privilege of supplying the pulpit half the time\" at their ex pense, they to be exempt from any tax towards Mr. Stone's salary. This vote was passed to accommodate the petitioners for a third religious society, and to induce them to unite in building the new meeting-house. It failed, however, in its object. In the following March thirty-six persons were incorporated by the name of \" The Third Religious Society in Augusta\" with the full powers of a parish.2 By this act any members of the South parish and of the newly incorporated society could change from one parish to the other at any time previous to the first day of the following April. But members of the South parish becoming members of the Third Religious Society by the act of incorporation, or by uniting with it before the first of April following, were required to pay their proportion of all taxes assessed, and arrears due, and of all sums which the South parish might raise within a year from the date of the act \"to completely finish the new meeting-house in said parish.\" This ample power to assess the recusant members had a happy effect in bringing about the reconciliation which speedily followed. The parish, on the 13th of June following, directed the com mittee to close the sale of pews at public or private sale. This did not raise a sum sufficient to finish the house, and the com mittee, on the 6th of July, recommended \"a grant\" of money, to be raised by taxation, adequate for that purpose, \" agreeable to the late act of the legislature.\" This was voted on the first 1 Parish Records, p. 106\u20148. * Mass.

Shubael Pitts' black smith shop, on the east side of Water street, at the foot of Court street. This shop adjoined the new blacksmith shop of J. & E. B. Williams. Both were consumed, and an old building belonging to Capt. Nathan Weston was pulled down to prevent the flames from spreading. The Hallowell engine arrived early and afforded great assistance in subduing the fire. The loss was nine hundred dollars, six hundred of which was generously contributed to the relief of the sufferers by the citizens. Settlers upon the Plymouth Company's land without title had shown for some years a disposition to resist the claims of the rightful owners. This arose from the operation of various causes, such as the occasional failure of titles purchased, conflicting claims of proprietors to the same lands, and the undisturbed pos session which many had enjoyed for a long time without adverse claim, and the large price demanded for lands which had been greatly increased in value by the improvements of the settlers. Lawsuits naturally followed, creating irritation and begetting a sense of wrong and oppression. To protect themselves in their rights, real or fancied, the set tlers banded, together and made common cause in measures of resistance, and finally proceeded to such lengths as to set at defi ance all lawful authority. Surveyors were threatened and intimi dated ; sheriffs shot at and wounded and their horses killed ; the jail in Wiscasset was forcibly opened and some of the prison ers confined for high-handed offences liberated ; and a general feeling of distrust and alarm prevailed. In Balltown (now Jeffer son,) the running of the line between the Kennebec Patent and 1 This report differs somewhat from final report July 19, 1810."], [383, "1808. Augusta Patrol. 351 the public lands was prevented by force. To provide a remedy for this, the General Court, by resolves of February 15, 1804. directed the appointment of a surveyor to run the line, and the employment of a sufficient force to sustain him. In the resolvet the General Court say, that \"uniform opposition has been made to running the line by divers persons, who have threatened to destroy the lives and property of all such persons as should be engaged in the work, and who, in some instances, have fired upon surveyors and others so engaged, and assembled in large numbers and in arms to prevent the running of the same.\" Also that the jail in Wiscasset had been opened by force and \" several persons liberated therefrom who were there confined under a charge of having riotously prevented the running of the lines.\" Any per sons arrested for resisting the surveyor were to be confined as a measure of security in the jail of Cumberland county, where they could not be so easily rescued as at Wiscasset. The settlers committing these offences were called \" squatters,\" from sitting down upon lands without leave, and \" Indians \" from assuming an Indian disguise. In Kennebec they threatened to burn the court house and jail in Augusta, destroy the records and liberate the prisoners, also to destroy the dwellings of persons obnoxious from their connection with the Kennebec Company. As a measure of precaution against the execution of these threats, a patrol was organized to watch in the streets during the night. It was a voluntary association of the principal inhabitants of the town, under the name of \"Augusta Patrol.\" Its motto was \" Custodia, est Clypeus,\" \u2014 the watch is our protection. The asso ciation had a standing committee, consisting of Joseph North, Ezekiel Page and Elias Craig; and a secretary, Robert C. Vose. The members numbered twenty-eight, two of whom served night ly, taking their turns every fortnight. Printed bills were issued notifying them of the nights they were to serve and the \" rounds \" they were to take. Gen. Sewall and Dr. Cony commenced the watch, January 15, 1808. The second night assigned them was February 24th. They were directed, by regulations printed on the back of the notice, to commence at eleven o'clock in the evening, and patrol once in two hours, until daylight, the following rounds, \"Commencing at Burton's Inn, from thence through Water street into Court street by way of Capt. Joshua Gage's ; thence, passing the new meeting-"], [384, "Requisition for Military Force. 1808. 352 house into Middle street to the mill stream ; thence, passing by Judge Bridge's house down through Mill street near the mills, to Kennebec bridge ; thence, over the bridge through Bridge street to the school house ; thence, down to the town landing ; thence, back to said Burton's by way of Fort Western ; thence, up Winthrop street, passing Hamlen's lane to the court house ; and through Whitwell street to said Burton's.\" l This extensive circuit was so arranged, that while the houses of the principal citizens were visited once in each round, the jail and court house was passed twice. The resistance to sheriffs and their deputies prevented the ser vice of civil process. They were shot at and wounded and their horses killed. . One, more adventurous than others, \" had seven balls shot through him and his horse,\" and was made \"a cripple for life.\" These outrages were at length brought to the notice of government by the action of Arthur Lithgow, sheriff of the county. Henry Johnson, one of his deputies, on the twenty-fifth of November of the past year, while at Fairfax, now Albion, in the discharge of the duties of his office, was fired upon and wounded by men in disguise, others at the time lying by concealed in the woods. This and other acts of a similar nature induced the sheriff on the nineteenth day of January, of this year, to make a requisi tion on Major General Sewall for a detachment of four hundred men \"to defeat the purposes of the insurgents,\" as he called those whose \"combinations to oppose, by force, the civil authority have been so openly avowed, that it is no longer prudent or safe to attempt to execute the laws, or to enforce, in the ordinary way, the regular administration of justice.\" Gen. Sewall immediately ordered the required detachment from the Eighth Division of the militia, and required it to be held \"in constant readiness to march at the sheriff's shortest notice.\" He notified Governor Sullivan of the action taken, and sent him such papers as were furnished by the sheriff. Upon the examination of these papers, the governor readily came to the conclusion that' the facts presented did not warrant the call for a military force. The reasons among others assigned were, that it did not appear ' Burton's inn was the Kennebec House. State street was then called Court street, and Capt. Gage lived on Grove street, in the present residence of I. D. Sturgis. Middle street is now Laurel. Mill street passed from the south end of Kendall street down to Wyman's mill.

Sullivan's Proclamation. \u2014 Betterment Law. 353 that an insurgent force was embodied in opposition to the govern ment ; and, before a military force should have been called the measures provided by the Riot Act of 1786, \" ought to have been attempted by the sheriff, with the magistrates and Posse-Comila lus.\" The governor, therefore, issued a proclamation on the second day of February, declaring the requisition unnecessary and not warranted under the circumstances, and ordered the detachment disbanded. At the same time he enjoined obedience to the laws, and called upon \"all good people in the county to afford their ready aid, as the law directs, to officers and magistrates.\" ' This \"vote catching proclamation,\" as it was called by the Gazette, was sent by express to the county, where it was distribu ted, and the governor communicated the action he had taken to the General Court, then in session, before which a petition of Henry Johnson, the deputy sheriff, was pending for compensation for wounds received in upholding the laws. On the fifth of February, \"a deputation from the settlers arrived at Augusta, and had a conference with the high sheriff,\" with what result is not known. But shortly after, John 0. Webster, another deputy of the same sheriff, had his horse shot in the same town of Fairfax, while in the execution of the duties of his office.2 In order to quiet the settlers, and allay the spirit of opposition to lawful authority which was abroad in the county, the General Court had under consideration a law designed to protect the settlers in the rights which they claimed to the increased value given to lands in their possession by their labor and improve ments; and, at the same time, to provide, by an equitable adjust ment, for the right of the proprietors in the soil. This law was finally perfected and passed, receiving the governor's signature on the second of March. As it secured to tenants who had been in possession six years, their improvements or \"betterments,\" it was called, by Gen. William King, who was of the committee which framed it, \"The Betterment Law.\" The spirit of insubordination, which originated with the settlers on the east side of the river in relation to lands, was now, owing to the distress of the times arising from the operation of the embargo, extended to towns west of the river in relation to the collection of debts. A large part of the inhabitants of Kennebec depended upon the lumber trade for a livelihood, and the means 2 Kennebec Gazette, Feb. 12, -1808. 1 Sullivan's Proclamation. 2>I"], [386, "Collection of Debts Resisted. 1808. 354 of paying their debts. A total stagnation in this business, arising from the embargo, deprived them of the power of paying. Suits followed, threatening to consume their little property, \"and nothing but ruin stared them in the face.\" Thus situated, some of the inhabitants of Belgrade, Rome and Westpond assumed the Indian disguise, \"and stopped and searched persons traveling through their towns, and prevented by force the collection of debts.\" They were banded in numbers \"from five to seventy,\" and were well armed and equipped. A writer in the Gazette, of March 11th, says: \"Such is the general combination against the execution of the laws, that the sheriffs cannot be prevailed on to risk their lives in attempting their duty ; should you read the riot act, as the governor recom mends, they would answer you, \"me no understand, quick walk, quick walk.\" This mode of guerilla warfare was worse than open and formal insurrection. In the latter, a crisis would soon be reached, and a remedy provided ; but in the former, disguise and secrecy prevented the notoriety which would call for the interven tion of the strong arm of government, and the guerillas as effectu ally attained their object in the total suspension of the collection of debts.1 At this time an exciting scene occurred in Augusta. The inti mations and threats which for some time had been circulated, that the \" Indians\" would come in force from the upper towns and 1 Some persons injured by the lawless acts of the settlers were compensated by the General Court.

The fire was discovered in the upper story. It rapidly spread, enveloping the building. Citizens, with the fire engine, had arrived in great numbers, but were pow erless to stay the progress of the flames. The prisoners were mustered under guard and taken to the house of Lot Hamlen, where Artcmas Libby now lives. Old McCausland showed no disposition to escape, but was active in securing and guarding the other prisoners. The citizens of Hallowell attended in great numbers \"with both their engines,\" and were entitled to \"much credit\" for their \"prompt and spirited exertions,\" The jail and jail-house were reduced to ashes, but Pitt Dillingham, the keeper, in anticipation of such an event had removed the papers to a place of safety, so that none were lost. During the same evening an attempt was made to burn the court house ; \"two fire-brands\" were placed for that purpose in \"one corner of the upper part of the building,\" but were fortunately discovered just aster the fire took, and were extinguished without doing much damage.1 During the fire, so serious was the aspect of affairs that at ten o'clock at night two of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, residing in town, requested Gen. Sewall \"to detach such a num ber of the militia as he should judge adequate to the emergency, to guard and secure the prisoners, the court house and county records.\" The General promptly complied with the request, ordered the Augusta Light Infantry upon duty ; and they con tinued under arms during the night.

Barlow's Indians. 357 The fire caused increased alarm from the general belief, at the time, that it was the work of disaffected settlers, and that other threats which they had made would be executed. But it did not appear that they had any direct connection with the fire at the jail, as that was the work of an inmate, Capt. Edward Jones. The fire at the court house was more likely to be their work of mischief, and may have been set in concert with the one at the jail, so as to more effectually accomplish the work of destruction. Capt. Jones previously had kept the Kennebec tavern, and was then in con finement for stealing. He was indicted for burning the jail and also for stealing, and was convicted of both offences at the Octo ber term of the Supreme Judical Court, this year. For 'the first offence he was sentenced to two months solitary confinement and nine years hard labor in the state prison ; for the last, fifteen days solitarj' confinement and one year hard labor.1 Nathan Barlow was a leader of the Indians, in their troubles, in the region of Fairfax and Freedom. In the spring of this year, Moses Nelson, then a young man of eighteen years, whose fathei had settled in Malta on the head waters of the Sheepscof . was informed that he could have a lot of land in Freedom by improv ing it, and he, in company with another young man, proceeded thither and commenced felling trees. They had chopped a week when they were notified to join \"Barlow's force of Indians,\" which were then said to number one hundred and fifty. This was more than young Nelson had undertaken to do, and he abandoned the land to his companion and left for home; men were, however, sent for him by Barlow, whom he managed to elude.2 Barlow was afterwards apprehended and confined in Augusta jail, when fears were entertained that an effort would be made to liberate him. He was tried at the Supreme Judicial Court, in June of this year, for \"felonious assault with intent to murder,\" and was con victed and sentenced to thirty days solitary confinement and two years hard labor in the State prison.3 Alter serving his sentence he returned \"a finished rogue,\" and engaged in burglarious opera tions up and down the river. Judge Bridge, Reuel Williams and Robert G. Shaw had, in 1807, purchased a-ten mile lot in Monmouth, belonging to the \"Baker 1 Kennebec Gazette, Oct. 21, 1808. 3Kennebec Gazette, June, 1808, 'Moses Nelson of Winslow, seventy years old in 18C0."], [390, "Political Removals. 1808. 358 right,\" which had laid some time with dormant title and had settlers on it. The Judge went to Monmouth shortly after on horseback, on a pioneering tour, to notify and open negotiations with the settlers, but he was glad to escape from them with the loss of his horse which was shot while tied to a fence. They also purchased a lot, a mile wide, in Waterville, which extended fifteen miles from the river; Judge Bridge, went on a similar visit to the settlers on the rear end of this lot, but he found them so rough and defiant that he hastily retired. Many anony mous letters were sent by these settlers to Reuel Williams the other proprietor, containing ferocious threats, and indicating by rudely drawn characters the terrible things they would do to him ; one of them was the not very pleasing figure of a full length effigy of himself suspended by the neck with a rope from a tree.1 Again, as late as August 1812, Bridge and Williams received a letter threatening them with death and destruction of their dwell ings by fire if suits then pending against settlers were not discon tinued. They professed to number sixty or seventy who were bound by an oath to execute their threats or perish in the attempt, and as additional assurance that they were in earnest they say the letter is signed with their blood. In the place of signatures were represented two black coffins and a red hatchet; the latter was not colored with blood ; it is of a pink color, as fresh in appearance after fifty years as though it was just made.2 The action of Arthur Lithgow, as sheriff, in relation to the dis turbances in the county, having come to the knowledge of Gov.

Sewall, he submit ted to his council, on the fifteenth of February, this question : \"Whether it is, or is not necessary, in order to restore peace and tranquility to the county of Kennebec, to maintain the authority of law, and support the honor of the government there, to remove the said Arthur Lithgow from the office of sheriff of that county, by the appointment of a more competent person in his place ?\" The communication propounding this question was accompanied by sundry documents from Gen. Sewall, Pitt Dillingham, Lithgow, nenry Johnson and others, containing an account of the disturb ances and the measures taken to quell them. The council considered not only the \"particular case submitted,\" but also the case of the \"sheriff of the county of Hancock,\" and ' Reuel Williams. -Original letter, now (1862) before me."], [391, "1808. Political Removals. 359 gave an \" expression of their general sentiments on the subject at large.\" This \"subject at large,\" underlying the particular case presented, was removals from office for want of political sympathy with the National and State governments which were republican, while Lithgow and others holding office were federalists. They said in relation to the*heated contest by which the republicans attained to power, that \"the cruel lacerations of private character, of friends and of families, of goodness and of greatness ; the in jurious and perverse denunciations of the principles of our State and National governments, of their highest, intermediate and more subordinate,officers, cannot be so far forgotten by the people as to admit of the idea of safety but from their friends. As the advo cates of the new order of things are peculiarly responsible for its success, they ought principally to direct its operations. If it fails, the failure and the disgrace will be theirs.

Samuel Titcomb a committee to superintend the building; and1 directed a tax of $8,000 to be levied on the county for the pur pose. But the legislature granted, at its next session, but $5,000,, and the court added Capt. Joshua Gage and Samuel Carr to the building committee. The temporary jail was so insecure that a constant guard was required to prevent the escape of prisoners. This was quite expensive to the county. Dillingham, the jailor, was paid in December, $358 for a guard from the fifth of the previous July ; and Jesse Robinson and a number of others were paid for the same period $160, for \"guarding Barlow and other prisoners,\" and compensation was made to Arthur Lithgow for \"escapes from prison,\" to the amount of nearly sixty dollars. The new stone building was hurried forward, and before com pletion, in December, was \" approved and accepted as a gaol,\" and the sheriff was directed, on account of its greater security, to> cause it to be used in addition to the wooden jail. The following April, an additional tax of $3,000 was laid upon the county for its completion. It was much in advance of the prison accommoda tions of that day, and was considered a very expensive and secure structure. It was two stories high, each story divided by an alley way in the center separating blocks of cells. The lower cells 1 Pamphlet printed by order of General Court, Nov. 15, 1808. \"Records of Court of Sessions, vol. 2, p. 60."], [393, "1808. Embargo Meeting. 361 were lighted and ventilated by openings in the walls six inches wide and two feet long. In these were kept the worst criminals. The upper story had a grated window to each cell, and in these were confined poor debtors . and criminals confined for crimes of less magnitude. The walls were constructed of large blocks of rough hammered stone fastened together with iron dowels. A large grated door above and below closed the alley ways, and heavy iron doors the cells. The jail was connected, by a brick ell, with a two story square brick jail house, which is now standing at the corner of Winthrop and State streets as altered by Ai Staples. It is surrounded by a bank wall of stones which were in the walls of the old jail. In view of the great distress caused by the continuance of the embargo, the selectmen, who were probably moved by a petition for that purpose, called a town meeting for the 20th of August, to consider \"the propriety of petitioning the President of the United States for the purpose of taking off the Embargo.\" Thomas Bow man was unanimously chosen moderator of the meeting, when John Davis, in an opening speech, took a general view of the subject advocating the measure, and was followed by Solomon Vose in favor, and Nathan Weston, George Read and Noah Woodward in opposition. Other gentlemen considered the \"unconstitutionality and ruinous effects of the several embargo laws.\" When Mr. Davis again arose and concluded the lengthy debate of the day \"in an elegant, spirited and impressive speech, in which he severely animadverted on the views and conduct of the leading democrats.\" The meeting was spirited and large, and so unani mous that it was said \"to the honor of Augusta,\" when the vote was taken \"only seven dissenting votes could be produced.\"1 A committee of nine was then appointed, consisting of John Davis, Arthur Lithgow, Benjamin Whitwell, James Bridge, Daniel Cony, Solomon Vose, George Crosby, Peter T. Vose and Samuel Howard, to draft a petition, who, after -a short adjournment for that pur pose, reported the following : To the President of the United States. The Inhabitants of the town of Au- gusta, in legal town meeting assembled, respectfully represent: Thai in common with the other towns in this district, they have severely felt the embarrassments and distress produced by the several acts of Congress lay ing an embargo on the navigation and commerce of the United States.

They respectfully suggest their conviction that sufficient time has elapsed for the operation of the experi ment and that the result has been unsuccessful. That notwithstanding the belligerent powers have interdicted our commercial intercourse with certain European ports, and have restrained a part of the lucrative commerce recently enjoyed by the citizens of our country, yet that a sufficient portion of it re mains to employ the industry of our merchants and the activity and enterprise of our mariners, and enable the one to avoid the evils of bankruptcy and the other the necessity of seeking subsistence for their families in the service of foreigners. And although, from a disposition to rely on the wisdom and pater nal regard of their rulers, they have patiently sustained the restrictions laid on commerce and navigation, yet they feel encouraged to hope that recent events in Europe have in so great a degree changed the aspect of political affairs that those sources of commerce which are at present closed may again be opened to our enterprising citizens and the prospect of relief be realized. They eagerly embrace the right authorized by the constitution, the exercise of which is warranted by their present situation, to address their rulers upon subjects which relate to the general interest, and in cases of distress to apply to the wisdom of government for relief; and therefore respectfully request. That the laws relating to the Embargo may be in part or wholly suspended, according to the powers vested in the President by the Congress of the United States, or in case that the President should consider that for this purpose the authority of Congress should be necessary, that that honorable body may be speedily convened for the purpose. This reported draft of a petition to the President was unani mously adopted, and the selectmen and town clerk were directed to forward the same, which was accordingly done by Capt. Seth Williams, chairman of the board. In due time the answer of the President of the United States, to the petition of the inhabitants of the town of Augusta, was received, aj follows :"], [395, "President Jefferson's Answer. 363 1808. September 10, 1808. Sir, \u2014 I beg leave to communicate through you the enclosed answer to the Representation which came to me under cover from you, and to add the assur ances of my respect. Th. Jefferson. Seth Williams, Esq., Augusta, Maine. To the Inhabitants of the town of Augusta in legal town meeting assembled : Your representations and request were received on the 8th instant, and have been considered with the attention due to every expression of the sentiments and feelings of so respectable a body of my fellow-citizens. No person has seen with more concern than myself the inconveniences brought on our coun try in general by the circumstances of the times in which we happen to live ; times to which the history of nations presents no parallel. Por years we have been looking as spectators on our brethren of Europe, afflicted by all those evils which necessarily follow an abandonment of the moral rules which bind men and nations together. Connected with them in friendship and commerce, we have happily so far kept aloof from their calamitous conflicts by a steady observance of justice towards all, by much forbearance and multiplied sacri fices. At length, however, all regard to the rights of others having been thrown aside, the belligerent powers have beset the highway of commercial intercourse with Edicts which, taken together, expose our commerce and mari ners, under almost every distinction, a prey to their fleets and armies. Each party, indeed, would admit our commerce with themselves, with the views of affecting us in their war against the other. But we have wished war with nei ther. Under these circumstances were passed the laws of which you complain by those delegated to exercise the powers of legislation for you, with every sympathy of common interest in exercising them faithfully. In reviewing these measures, therefore, we should advert to the difficulties out of which a choice was of necessity to be made. To have submitted our rightful commerce to prohibitions and tributary exactions from others would have been to surren der our independence. To resist them by arms was war, without consulting the state of things or the choice of the nation. The alternative preferred by the Legislature of suspending a commerce placed under such unexampled diffi culties, besides saving to our citizens their property and our mariners to their country, has the peculiar advantage of giving time to the belligerent nations to revise and consider their conduct as contrary to their interests as to our rights. In the event of such peaee or suspension of hostilities between the bellig erent powers of Europe, or of such change in their measures affecting neutral commerce as may render that of the United States sufficiently safe in the judg ment of the President, he is authorized to suspend the embargo; but no peace or suspension of hostilities, no change of measures affecting neutral commerce, is known to have taken place. The Orders of England and the decrees of France and Spain existing at the date of these laws are still unrepealed as far as we know. In Spain, indeed, a contest for the government appears to have"], [396, "Embargo Resolutions. la ... 364 arisen ; but of its course or prospects we have no information on which pru dence would undertake a hasty change in our policy even were the authority of the Executive competent to such a decision. You desire that, in this defect of power, Congress may be specially con vened. It is unnecessary to examine the evidence or the character of the facts which are supposed to dictate such a call, because you will be sensible, on an attention to dates, that the legal period of their meeting is as early as, in this extensive country, they could be fully convened by a special call. I should with willingness have executed the wishes of the inhabitants of Augusta, had peace or repeal of the obnoxious Edicts or other changes pro duced the case in which alone the laws have given me that authority; and so many motives of justice and interest lead to such changes that we ought con tinually to expect them. But while these edicts remain the legislature alone can prescribe the course to be pursued. Th. Jefferson. An effect of the embargo was the manufacture of iron from bog ore, at the mouth of the fifteen mile stream, on the Ken nebec, in Clinton, by Jonathan B. Cobb, who informed the public that he had erected a forge at that place, where he \"manufactured bar iron of an excellent quality,\" also mill cranks ; and plough and crowbar moulds of his manufacture, were kept constantly for sale by Robinson & Crosby, at Augusta.' Another effect was numerous disturbances occurring in various parts of the United States, from the endeavors on the one part to evade, and on the other to enforce the embargo, and numerous prosecutions were commenced against supposed offenders. At the commencement of this year, the embargo continuing with unmitigated severity, it was in contemplation to hold a county con vention to consider the subject, when Joseph North and twelve others, on the ninth day of January, petitioned the selectmen to call a town meeting, \"as soon as may be,\" to consider the \"dis tressed situation\" of the country, to choose delegates to a county convention, to address the legislature, or adopt such other meas ures as may be thought \"expedient and necessary in the present calamitous condition of our public affairs.\" This meeting assem bled at the meeting-house on the ltith of January, and having chosen Joseph North moderator, proceeded to the consideration of the subject, when it was determined to be \"inexpedient\" to send delegates to a county convention. A committee was then chosen to draft and report resolutions, also a memorial to the legislature' 1 Advertisement in Kennebec Gazette, Feb. 16, 1808."], [397, "1809. Embargo Resolutions. 365 expressive of the sense of the meeting. This committee consisted of Solomon Vose, John Davis, George Crosby, Thomas Bowman, Peter T. Vose, Samuel Cony, Henry W. Puller, William Brooks and Samuel Howard. The meeting adjourned for one hour, at the expiration of which the committee came in and reported the follow ing preamble and resolutions : Embargo Resolutions. The Constitution of the United States, as well as of the Commonwealth, guarantees to the people the right of meeting in a peaceable manner to consult upon the common good and to petition for a redress of grievances; and when ever the republic is in danger the exercise of this right becomes a duty of the first magnitude. A degree of watchfulness and jealousy of our rulers is a virtue in republicans, and is the only check to prevent encroachments upon the rights of the people. The awful crisis has arrived when it become sary for the friends of our independence to make a firm and decided stand ; when it becomes all-important to throw aside minor considerations and unite for (he common good; when a sense of common danger draws us together to meet the approaching storm; and when we are impelled by the duty we owe ourselves and our posterity to speak of the conduct of our rulers in the lan guage of freemen. Therefore; Resolved, That the restrictions and impositions on our trade and commerce are too great and ruinous any longer to be borne, and that the great distress of our country demands immediate relief. Resolved, That to the ruinous policy in the rejection of the British treaty is justly attributable the calamitous condition of our country and its impending ruin ; that circumstances justify a suspicion that the hand which moves and controls the machine of state is foreign, distant, generally unknown, whose influence is contagion and whose touch is death. Resolved, That from the exposition of all the public documents, there is not sufficient cause to warrant a war with Great Britain ; that she is fighting not only for her own rights and liberties, but for the preservation and security of the brave Spaniards and of every other oppressed people on earth. Resolved, That we view with indescribable horror the raising a standing army of fifty thousand men in time of pence, with the unprecedented power in the President of appointing its officers, without any ostensible object; while we have too much reason to fear its real one is the destruction of our republi can form of government, which has cost our fathers so much blood and treasure in the acquisition, and to which we are so strongly attached from inclination, feeling and habit, and which appears designed to prepare the way for Monarchy, which has been unquestionably proved to have long been the favorite and chosen system of the more who for the next four years is to govern the des tinies of the nation. Resolved, That no friend to the liberties of his country will accept a com mission in an army that is to rivet chains on his countrymen, destroy the ines timable names of Citizen and Civilian and render America a military despotism."], [398, "1809. 366 Memorial to the Legislature. Resolved, That we view with the most painful apprehensions the additional Embargo law which has just passed both houses of the national legislature \u2014 a law which threatens all we hold dear in society ; which no longer permits us an asylum at our firesides from pillage and murder ; which totally destroys even the coasting trade ; consolidates the Union ; is subversive of the first principles of civil liberty ; and which if carried into execution with all its con templated oppression will bring on a civil war, and must inevitably terminate in a separation of the States. Resolved, That with our brethren of Hallowell, we view with equal detesta tion the lawless and wanton acts committed by the hirelings of power in the pretended execution of the duties of their office ; and that the channel of direct information is so often impeded or diverted from its course by those who occupy the Post office department. And whereas we have heretofore petitionad Congress, but without effect; therefore, Resolved, That a committee be appointed to draft a memorial to the legisla ture of this Commonwealth, unfolding to them our distresses and misery, and assuring them of our determination to defend the cause of liberty and real republicanism ; praying them to adopt such measures that Massachusetts may again, as in the days of '75, dashin pieces the shackles of Tyranny and Oppres sion, and open the door to Freedom. Resolved, That these proceedings be signed by the Moderator and Town Clerk and published in the Kennebec Gazette.1 These high toned and spirited resolutions, which reflected the federal sentiment of New England at the time, and foreshadowed the remedy for \" evils too grevious to be borne,\" are in the hand writing- of John Davis, with corrections and amendments by Solo mon Vose. They were adopted by a vote of eighty-five to twenty three, as was also the following lengthy memorial to the legisla ture, which accompanied the report and formed a part of it. Memorial. To the Honorable the Senate and the Honorable the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in General Court assembled Jan- uary, 1809 : The Inhabitants of Augusta with diffidence approach the presence of their Rulers. Inconsiderable in consequence and interior in situation, it has seemed peculiarly proper that they should rather imitate than emulate their brethren of the commercial seaboard towns in expressions of patriotism and confidence in their State legislature. The momentous crisis, however, of our public affairs, paramount to all considerations of etiquette, irresistibly impels them to the adoption of a Constitutional right for a redress of grievances, unequivo cal in their nature and incalculable in their extent. 1 Original Resolutions in MS."], [399, "1809. Safely in Compact of Northern States. 367 With submission amounting almost to criminal apathy, we have suffered privations and restrictions, never before expected of or endured by a free people. We have seen our commercial consequence mouldering into ruin, and permitted the sacrifice of almost the whole capital of our fortunes. Our Emporiums exhibit nothing but the sickly, spasmodic estate of the American nation ; and we are at a loss which most to admire, the moderation and for bearance of the people, or the cruel and unnecessary exactions of their rulers, but now that even the means of subsistance is at hazard, and the sacred asylum of our dwellings no longer held inviolable, silence would be crime, and resist ance may become a virtue of the first magnitude. With mingled emotions of pride and regret, we reflect on the blessings we enjoyed in the just and dignified administration of the immortal Washington. Our national character rose to the highest point of elevation ; civil and religious liberty was considered the birthright of an American, and a spirit of commer cial enterprise was aroused and maintained, productive of public wealth and individual prosperity ; but the full tide of philosophical experiment arrested our high career, and has almost obliterated the name of America from the catalogue of nations; our national honor is at the point of derision; our Treasury, both in capital and resource, exhausted ; foreign commerce annihi lated, and home trade gone to decay ; a Standing Army raised in a time of peace to enforce the laws of a Republican Government; the voice of complaint and distrust vociferated from Georgia to Maine, and we have little in the prospec tive but national bankruptcy and military despotism. The meeting of our national legislature we had fondly anticipated as the period of these our unnecessary trials ; and that the trident of commerce would again have gladdened our western shores. In the supplicating lan guage of distress, we describe our grievances, full in the belief that our prayers would not have proved unavailing; but this our confidence has been our folly; from hope we have passed to disappointment and from disappoint ment to despair, almost beyond hope ; and we are compelled by imperious neces sity, in the face of Heaven to declare, that our confidence in the present ad ministration of the national government is at an end; and that they seem fatally determined to drive us to the dreadful alternative of yielding up our Republican form of Government and submitting to the basest tyranny and op pression, or seeking safety and protection in an Union and Solemn compact of the Northern States.1 We view with utter abhorrence and detestation the measures pursued by an Imperial Majority in our National Legislature ; new and more arbitary restric tions are imposed upon us, and though the cup of degradation and distress was already full to the brim, the point of the bayonet is to take the place of the cheerful, willing obedience of a free people; the constitution we had vain ly concluded interposed a barrier against a standing army in a time of peace; but the instructive lesson of experience has taught us that Constitutions and laws, precedents and doctrine, form no adequate security against the inordinate desire of power in ambitious men. 'This was first written \"New England States,\" and altered by Solomon Vose to Northern States."], [400, "368 Influence of France. \u2014 Standing Army. 1809. We have long seen with deep concern the blind and ruinous predilection of our Democratic Administration in favor of one Belligerent to the injury and prejudice of another; the smallest errors of Great Britain have been magnified into the most outrageous aggressions, while to France there has been a marked, mean, cowardly and cringing disposition, a justification of the basest measures, and a blind system of favoritism unworthy the Rulers of a Great and Free Peo ple ; and we tremble lest the liberties and Independence of America are to be immolated at the shrine of the Mighty Tyrant of Europe, whose insatiable ambition and thirst of power disturb the peace and happiness of every State, pervert the sacred name of liberty, and threaten to establish an universal sys tem of usurpation and tyranny. And what, under heaven, is the security of America against the enormous strides of the mighty Mammoth of Europe? The wooden walls of the British Nation. Yes, impressive truth ; remove this barrier, and America becomes a Colony to Imperial France. On the issue of the unequal contest in which Great Britain is now engaged, depends the welfare and existence not only of this country, but every civilized society upon earth. With the deepest concern we recognize that a Standing Army, fully adequate to rivet the chains of despotism, is now to be the portion of America. We view it as the portentious precursor of the requiem of our liberties. It is in vain to talk of freedom, where the arbitrary will and daring assumption of power in our Rulers are to be justified and enforced at the point of the bayonet. Our case is indeed critical in the extreme; but, thank heaven, the remedy is yet in our power; the National Government was created and instituted for our use and benefit; if perverted or misused we have only to recall our Agency, reassume our inherent and unalienable rights and authority, and institute some other fiction more congenial to our interests and national honor. We indulge the hope that whatever differences have hitherto subsisted in the minds of the inhabitants of the Northern States upon abstract questions or political senti ment will be absorbed and lost in the general danger ; and that a spirit of unamimity will pervade and animate every rank and description of persons. Common interest should now induce us to unite for the preservation of Lib erty, Independence, and everything dear to us as Americans. We earnestly solicit the early attention of your Honorable Bodies to the alarming condition of our public affairs, and the common distress of our Coun try. Too severe and extensive are the grievances complained of to be much longer endured; and never was the saving help of Legislative interference more absolutely necessary. We would not presume to dictate the path of duty ; hut look with unshaken confidence to the wisdom and patriotic exertions of our State Legislature for the adoption of measures and remedies commen surate to the evils and danger of this awful crisis. If our condition admits of no relief, no amelioration ; if a weak or wicked Administration of our National Government has so far precipitated us into ruin that we think it better to go on than recede, and we are to be driven to the last point of desperation, the calamitous consequences are known only to Him \"who measures years and days and fortunes.\" In every event, however, of public exigency we owe to you, the Guardians of our Constitution and rights, the most unequivocal"], [401, "1809.

Solomon Vose, John Davis, George Crosby, Thomas Bowman, Peter Thatcher Vose, Samuel Cony, Henry Weld Fuller, Samuel Howard, William Brooks. The new condition of affairs in the South parish, arising from the incorporation of the Third Religious Society, and the provision which required members of the former who should join the latter to pay not only the dues but all assessments for building made within the year, led to an informal conference resulting in an arrangement to unite on terms which are stated in notices of the subsequent action of each parish. At a parish meeting held April 17th, Joseph North, Solomon Vose and Seth Williams were appointed a com mittee to join with \"Mr. Stone and his church\" in sending for ministers and delegates to meet in council, \" for the purpose of dissolving the pastoral relation between the Rev. Daniel Stone and his parish.\" The committee was instructed \" not to proceed in this business until the Third Religious Society lodge, in the hands of such per sons as shall be agreed on, a bond made by James Bridge, Esq., and two or four others, conditioned for the payment of $ 1 ,000 to the Rev. D. Stone, and to be delivered to said Stone on the dissolu tion of his pastoral relations with the parish.\" The said religious society was also to give assurance in writing that they would unite with the parish on the dissolution of the ministerial relation. Soon after, May 8th, the Third Religious Society met at Joseph Burton's, who still kept the Kennebec tavern, aud agreed to unite with the South parish upon the dissolution of the pastoral relations of Mr. Stone, and James Bridge, Benjamin Whitwell aud John Eveleth were chosen a committee to petition the legislature to repeal the act incorporating the society ; and Bridge, Whitwell, Eveleth, Cyrus Guild and Samuel Titcomb were appointed to \" confer and agree with\" a committee of the South parish \" upon the principles and manner by which a union shall be effected.\" Bridge, Whitwell, Eveleth, John Davis, William Robinsou, Geo. 1 Original Memorial in MS.

A few days after, May 18th, the South parish held a meeting and chose a committee of conference on the sub ject of union with the Third Religious Society ; and the building committee was directed to \" determine on the time and arrange ments for the dedication\" of the new meeting-house; and a committee was chosen \" to express the sincere regard the parish entertain for the Rev. Daniel Stone, the unshaken confidence they have in his integrity and his moral and christian virtues,\" and their \"regret that the members of the parish are so few\" that they are unable to provide an adequate salary for his support ; and that \" they will ever cherish a cordial and affectionate wish that his future days may be useful and happy.\" The necessary preliminary measures having been adopted, the ecclesiastical council convened June 13th, and advised as matter of form what had been previously agreed to, the dismission of the Rev. Daniel Stone from the pastoral charge of the South parish and church in Augusta. The measures necessary to unite the two parishes were now adopted, and the first meeting of the re-united South parish was held at the old meeting-house, July 24th, at which three hundred dollars were raised for preaching, and James Bridge, Daniel Cony, John Davis, Solomon Vose and William Brooks were chosen a committee to \" procure a preacher.\" Measures were first taken in April, 1806, to erect the new meet ing-house. During that year the site was selected, a building committee chosen, a plan agreed upon and adopted in parish meeting, and the building committee directed to proceed with the erection whenever a fund arising from the sale of pews should amount to ten thousand dollars.1 This sum must have been soon obtained, for we find Peter T. Vose and Solomon Vose as agents advertising, January 13, 1807, for underpinning \"to be well hewn and square edged \" for the \"new meeting-house, to be delivered near the grammar school house previously to the first of May,\" for which they promised to pay cash on delivery.

Meeting-House Dedicated. 371 preparations the frame was raised in July, and the work on the house was prosecuted under contract with John Hartwell and Stephen Jewett, carpenters. The divisions in the South parish, and the organization of a \" Third Religious Society,\" together with the persistent effort of MEETING-HOUSE, 1809. some to dispense with the services of their minister, must have embarrassed the parish in its great effort to erect and finish so expensive a house of worship ; but they who had it in charge were men of enlarged views and determined spirit, and with unfal tering perseverance they pushed on against every obstacle to final completion in 1809. The separation into two societies during the prosecution of the enterprise instead of paralyzing only stimulated exertion. It was insisted that it was but just and right that the members who had left should pay their proportion for building and finishing the meeting-house. The legislature agreed in this, and gave a power of taxation which brought the seceders troop ing back into the fold of the mother church. The reunited parish dedicated the new meeting-house on the twentieth day of September 1809. The Rev. Ichabod Nichols of Portland preached the sermon on the occasion, and Pitt Dilling ham provided a \"dedication dinner,\" for which the parish paid him fifty-five dollars.

Inside, wide galleries supported on large wooden columns were placed on two sides and one end, with two tiers of pews in front and rising seats in rear. On the floor were four tiers of pews divided lengthwise of the house by three aisles ; the broad center aisle separated the pews to the right and left of the main entrance; the side aisles were under the galleries and accommodated pews against the wall ; each side of an elevated pulpit reached by wind ing stairs of nine steps was a block of pews end to the wall, which opened upon an aisle passing from wall to wall across the house. The pews were large and numbered about one hundred. On the end gallery front over the broad entrance, was a large clock in a gilded circular case ; a golden eagle with extended wings perched on top held in his beak a golden wire ornamented with gilded balls, which passed in a circular form to the sides of the clock. On the white dial was printed in letters that could be read from distant parts of the house, \"Presented by Hon. Daniel Cony, Esq., August 14, 1809.\" The clock gave warning of the lapse of time at the end of each hour by a peculiar tinkling sound. It was an expensive as well as valuable time keeper. The Rev.

They still continued in Balltown, Whitefield and Malta to band together to prevent the service of precepts and to drive off surveyors. At Warren, in the county of Lincoln, it became necessary at this time to call a military force to assist Col. Thatcher, the high sheriff, in the discharge of his duty, in suits in which some of the Ball- town settlers were parties. In the night following the mustering of the troops for this purpose, and as a measure of intimidation, an open coffin was placed on the front doorsteps of Thatcher's house, intimating thereby that he proceeded at the hazard of being its occupant.1 However, the troubles were adjusted and the mili- tary force not used. In the town of Malta, now Windsor, in Kennebec county, one of those acts of resistance to a surveying party, by settlers disguised as Indians, resulted in loss of life and occasioned a great excite ment. Aaron Choate, who lived upon a lot of land which he had agreed to purchase, had employed Paul Chadwick of Malta to act with Jonas Pratt as chainmen in assisting Isaac Davis to make the survey. The party were proceeding, on the eighth of September, with their survey, which they had nearly completed, when they were surprised by the sudden appearance of armed men disguised as Indians. At this time the surveyor was taking the topography of a brook, and Pratt and Chadwick were chaining, Chadwick ' E. Rowse, who was at Warren at the time."], [406, "374 Chadwick Murdered. 1809. leading. Choate had proceeded a few rods in advance, to the corner of the lot, where he sat down waiting for the chainmen to come up, when a noise in the bushes discovered the Indians, one of whom sprang forward, presented a pistol at his breast and extorted a promise of silence on pain of instant death. Just then Chadwick made his appearance, with chain in hand, on a spot which had been flowed by the brook and where he could be distinctly seen. The Indians hastily formed in a line, and one of their number pass ing behind gave the words \"fire low,\" when three guns were dis charged and Chadwick fell. Davis and Pratt fled ; Choate remained. The Indians gathered around their victim to ascertain the extent of his injuries, and some of them made unfeeling and taunting remarks, and then dispersed. Choate immediately went to his assistance, and having found that he was severely and probably mortally wounded, obtained help and conveyed him in a blanket, on a bier, to the house of David Leman, his wife's father, where languishing of his wounds he died in great distress two days after. The men who committed this outrage were nine in number, disguised by cloth caps of blue, red and party-colors running up, conelike, to a peak and descending about the neck, with a veil over the face per forated for the eyes and mouth. Some wore blankets ; all were armed, one or two with a staff with a piece of scythe in one end ; the others had guns. Notwithstanding their disguise two of the party were known to Chadwick, one to Choate, and the others were pointed out by strongly suspicious circumstances. The excitement which this occasioned was great, and increased as rumor of the affair magnified and spread it over the country. The suspected persons were David Lynn, Jabez Meigs, Elijah Barton, Prince Cain, Nathaniel Lynn, Jonas Proctor, Ansel Meigs, Joel Webber and Adam Pitts, all of Malta. Barton and Jabez Meigs were accused by the dying declaration of Chadwick, and David Lynn was identified by Choate. Major Abner Weeks, who lived near by, interested himself in bringing the offenders to justice, and James Brackett, a neighboring magis trate, issued warrants for their apprehension, which were delivered to Capt. Nathaniel Stanley, a deputy sheriff and commander of a militia company, with the request that he would call in aid his company to make the arrests. This Stanley resolutely declined and proceeded without them. Some of the accused were secured and arraigned before Brackett and discharged for want of sufficient"], [407, "1809. Prisoners Committed to Jail. 375 evidence.1 The suspected persons were concealed in the woods, where their friends, who were in communication with them, supplied their wants. It was soon perceived that this state of affairs on the part of the accused could not long continue, and it became the \" general opinion\" of their friends, \"that they should come forward and give themselves up.\" To this course Reuben Pairfield, father-in-law to Barton, advised, and Dr. Randall, one of their friends, had a lengthy conference with them in the woods, offering advice to the same effect. Accordingly on the fifteenth of September, about a week after the murder, all but Webber, who had absconded, appeared before Justice Brackett for examination ; and Thomas A. Hill appeared as counsel for government. The prisoners had now become repentant, and some of them were affected even to tears. The justice, after cautioning them as they stood around him, asked Barton \"if he was piresent when Chadwick was shot.\" He feelingly answered \"I was present to my very great shame and confusion.\" The same question was then put to each of the others, who severally confessed that they were present.2 This was considered sufficient to hold them, and on the same day they were committed to jail, in Augusta, to await the action of the grand jury at the ensuing October term of the Supreme Judicial Court. Now that the alleged murderers of Chadwick were safely lodged in jail, and the third day of October, the day on which the court was to sit, was slowly but surely approaching, their friends in Malta began to regret their hasty action in inducing them to sur render, and to view with alarm the preparation making for their trial and the strictness with which their place of confinement was guarded inside and out. These things appeared ominous of a felon's fate. Sympathy was excited, and a rescue contemplated. Rumors of movements to that end reached and excited the vigi lance of the civil authority ; and alarming reports were circulated and believed. It was said that a large number of armed men, disguised as Indians, had been seen in the woods between Augusta and Malta, who were prepared to rescue the prisoners from con finement, burn the county buildings, and destroy the dwellings of obnoxious landed proprietors or their agents. All this appeared probable from the known disposition and previou* conduct of the settlers, now grown desperate from the impending fate of some of 1 Merrick's report of trial. 8 Brackett's testimony in report of trial."], [408, "Alarming Reports \u2014 Contemplated Rescue. 1809. 376 their leaders ; and preparations were made accordingly. A cannon belonging to the old fort, mounted on cart wheels, loaded with musket balls, and under command of Moody Thurlow, was planted on the west end of the' bridge. The patrol was enlarged and active; sentinels were posted at night, and the citizens, each by himself, kept a viligant watch at their dwellings ; but nothing of importance occurred until the evening of the twenty-ninth of September, when a sudden alarm was raised that the Indians were coming. Great excitement ensued, followed by a sleepless night, which passed, however, without further disturbance than was created by the false alarm. The citizens had now become anxious and nervous from excite ment and watching, when about midnight of the third of October, the day on which the court sat, about seventy men, some disguised as Indians, approached on the east side of the river to the foot of \"Malta hill,\" within a hundred and fifty rods of the bridge. They were preceded by a spy, who came so near some posted sentinels at the corner of what are now Bangor and Cony streets, that three of them siezed and bore him away ; when a party of the insurgents rushed forward and rescued the prisoner, and in the affray which followed they seized and hurried Major Weeks, who happened to present, to the woods.1 Seldom had town threatened with sudden seige or sack exhibited wilder commotion than arose. Alarm guns were fired, the court house bell was rung, the Light Infantry turned out, the streets were filled with people and a general uproar ensued. General Sewall within an hour after the alarm, upon the hasty requisition of John Chandler, sheriff of the county, \" for an armed force\" to secure \"the prisoners in the gaol\" who were \"threatened to be liberated by a body of men\" then \" in arms in the vicinity,\" issued his orders, at one o'clock in the morning, directing \"the two companies commanded by Capts.

Militia called out. \u2014 Troops Arrive. 377 Early in the morning of the fourth, upon a written requisition of Sheriff Chandler and Judges North, Cony and Dummer, Gen. Sewall detached from his brigade three hundred men \"for the pro tection of the gaol,\" and \"for the suppression of a dangerous combination and insurrection,\" which it was apprehended \"would be excited to obstruct the course of justice and the due execution of the laws.\" The order directing this detachment was printed. It contained the requisition, referred to the law under which it was made, and required six companies, one in each of the towns of Augusta, Hallowell, Gardiner, Winthrop, Readfield and Sidney to march immediately to the jail in Augusta, \" completely armed and equipped with twenty-four cartridges and balls to a man, and with knapsacks and blankets and three days' provisions.\" At Augusta they were to be subject to the orders of Gen. Chandler as sheriff, but under \"the immediate command of Maj. Samuel Cony of Augusta.\" ' These orders were dispatched in great haste, and some of the troops arrived in town in the evening of the same day and took position near the jail. Capt. Page of the Hallowell artillery had been requested \"to send up one of his field pieces properly manned, in aid of the detachment.\" This had not arrived, and Gen. Sewall wrote Maj. Cony at half-past seven in the even ing \"to send an express to hasten it.\" It seasonably came, and was planted so as to command the entrance to the jail. Cannon still guarded the passage over the bridge, and sentinels were posted at prominent points in the town, who could not be passed after nine o'clock in the evening without the countersign. Thus prepared, and with a vigilance usually attending a state of active war, the night of the fourth passed without hostile demon stration from the lurking foe. On the fifth the remainder of the troops arrived, and Gen. Sewall informed Gov. Gore of his pro ceedings. The governor immediately issued his orders, \"express ing his extreme regret at the occasion,\" aud commending the \"promptitude and alacrity displayed by the major general\" in detaching the requisite force \"to prevent an apprehended obstruc tion to the course of justice and a due execution of the laws.\" The grand jury, at the October term of the Supreme Court, found a true bill for murder against the prisoners, and Joel Web- 1 Printed Division Order, Oct. 4th. 3 Gov.

Those in custody were now arraigned and pleaded not guilty, and a special term of the court was ordered to be holden by adjournment for thejr trial on the sixteenth of the following November. The forces now consisted of Capt. Reuel Howard's company of Augusta, Capt. Stephen Lovejoy's company of Sidney, Capt. Spencer Fenno's company of Hallowell \u2014 displaced after a few days by Capt. Benjamin's Prescott's company of the same place \u2014 Capt. Levi Johnson's company of Readfield, a Winthrop company under Lieut. Elijah Snell, and Capt. John Stone's company of Gar diner, and were encamped in barracks hastily erected in the fields in rear of L. W. Lithgow's house, State street, and the Gen. Sewall house (William S. Badger's) on the same street, then owned and occupied by Samuel Titcomb. To increase the efficiency of the soldiers they were daily drilled. Sentries continued to he posted at prominent points, and sentry-boxes were built for their protec tion in stormy weather, and the town assumed the appearance of a military post during actual war. Spies were sent into the enemy's territory to discover their movements. These were Charles Sewall and Capt. Stephen Jewett. They entered the hostile town of Malta from Pittston in the evening, called at the houses on the road, representing that they were from Wiscasset at one time, \u2014 for they went several times, \u2014 that they were in pursuit of cattle ; and again that they wanted a mill privilege to manufacture lumber. The men were generally from home, and the women, probably under instructions, were reserved in relation to the troubles. Yet the wife of one of the Meigs who was in jail, gave Gov. Gore the unbridled applica tion of her tongue for sanctioning the call for the military force. They passed through the town, but were unable to discover any movement or gathering of the settlers, and to avoid suspicion passed out by way of Vassalborough. On the 10th of October the fears of a rescue were so far dimin ished that \"the authority of the county \" authorized the \"guard for the protection of the gaol \" to be gradually diminished to one hundred men, and the companies from Winthrop and Readfield were permitted to retire, \"following each other by the space of two hours.\" They were required to return after a stated period, and in the meantime to hold themselves in readiness for instant service. The next day the Hallowell and Gardiner companies"], [411, "1809. Trial for Murder. 379 were permitted to return home on like terms. This left the town until the fourteenth in charge of the Augusta and Sidney com panies, when in pursuance of a plan of rotation these companies retired and a Vassalborough company, under Capt. Jonathan Low, and a Winthrop company, under Capt. Elijah Davenport, were detached for the service. They retired on the twenty-first and the Readfield company returned, accompanied by a Fayette company under Capt. Benjamin Palmer, which gave place on the twenty eighth to the returning companies from Hallowell and Gardiner. They, on the 4th of November, were succeeded by the Augusta and Sidney companies, which were relieved on the eleventh by the companies from Vassalborough and Winthrop. The Readfield and Fayette companies returned upon the Vassalborough and Winthrop companies retiring on the eighteenth. The trial of the prisoners was now progressing, and these companies remained until it ended on the twenty-fifth, when they were permitted to return upon the condition of \" holding themselves in readiness to inarch at a moment's warning in case of alarm.\" ' To return to the prisoners, whose time of trial was rapidly ap proaching, and whose friends were making preparation for their defence assisted by eminent counsel. The counsel for the pris oners were Prentiss Mellen, Samuel S. Wilde, Thomas Rice and Philip Leach. Solicitor General Daniel Davis conducted the prosecution. Jonas Proctor, one of the accused, to secure immunity had turned State's evidence ; and such was the apprehension of some of the witnesses who testified before the grand jury that they remained at Augusta until the trial rather than return to \"their homes at the supposed risk of their lives.\" * Great solicitude was manifested by the public as well as the prisoners, as the time for the sitting of the court drew near. Landed proprietors and their agents were not indifferent to the importance of the trial in which a number of lives were at stake and the supremacy of law securing their rights was to be vindicated. Upon assembling of the court, Thursday, November 16th, a large concourse of people appeared. The court was held by four Judges, Theodore Sedgwick, Samuel Sewall, George Thatcher and Isaac Parker. The prisoners, David Lynn, Jabez Meigs, Elijah 1 Original detachment orders of above dates. 'Judge Parker's charge, in Merrick's report."], [412, "1809. Jury. \u2014 Evidence. 380 Barton, Prince Cain, Nathaniel Lynn, Ansel Meigs aud Adams Pitts, were brought into court, and after pleading the counsel whom they had selected were assigned by the Court for the de fence. The Rev. Mr. Gillett then \" made a solemn, appropriate and impressive prayer.\" The accused were now permitted to challenge peremptorily twenty of the persons returned to serve as jurors, but after sixteen challenges a jury was empannelled.1 The trial now proceeded, witnessed by a crowded assembly, whose presence and interest continued undiminished during the lengthy proceedings. Many witnesses were examined. Much of the testimony related to the confession of the prisoners and their identity with the persons in disguise who shot Chadwick. This was somewhat contradictory, and an attempt was made to impeach some of the government witnesses. However, the testimony was sufficient to show that the prisoners were present, in disguise, at the time Chadwick was killed, intending to injure him, which was felony, and death having ensued it became murder ; but whose guns were discharged did not appear. Some of the witnesses testified with great reluctance, adding, after giving their testimony to important points, that they would not state it under oath ; and Jonas Proctor, who had turned State's evidence, declared, when put upon the stand, that he knew nothing about the murder, and that he did not see either of the prisoners on the day it was com mitted. It was currently reported at the time, and is handed down by tradition, that Chadwick was one of a band associated as \" Malta Indians,\" who were bound by \"an oath written and signed with blood\" to prevent surveys and resist proprietors in enforcing claims to their lands, and that it was infidelity to this oath that caused his murder. No allusion is made to this in a report of the trial. Solicitor Davis endeavored to establish, as a distinct point, \"premeditated malice,\" and would not have neglected so import ant testimony had it existed. However, frorfU some cause the feeling may have been stronger against Chadwick than others engaged in the survey, as when in pursuit of the surveying party the \"Indians\" inquired for the \"surveyor and Chadwick',\" and 'This jury consisted of Samuel Elkins, Cornville. foreman; William Doan, Green; Moses Dow, Vassalborough; Joseph Gifford, Fairfield; Moses Hast ings, Sidney ; James Lawrence, Fairfield; Daniel Lothrop, Jr., Leeds; Sam uel Mason, Industry; William Mower, Green; Samuel Smith, Ji.von ; Jere miah Wyman, Farmington ; and Robert Willy, Mercer."], [413, "1809. Prosecution and Defence. \u2014 Verdict. 381 said \"Chadwick had crooked e37es and they meant to straighten them.\" Some testimony also was adduced in relation to a diffi culty which occurred some three years previously between him and one of the Meigs, but however this may be, their main object doubt less was to prevent settlers yielding to proprietors' claims, and the order to \" fire low\" shewed an intention not to inflict the extreme penalty of death in accomplishing it. After the testimony was closed, Wilde first addressed the jury in defence of the prisoners in an argument noticeable for forensic ability, felicity of expression, nice discrimination and candid con sideration. He was followed by Mellen on the same side in a more massive but less captivating argument, in which no point of discrepancy in the testimony was unnoticed, and no suggestion of doubt was not fully enforced. So lengthy were these efforts that the solicitor general said to the jury, as he commenced his argument, \"For the last three days, gentlemen, you have been wholly occupied in attending to the solicitations of mercy.\" He then reminded them of \"the more severe duty of administering justice to the accused,\" and forcibly arrayed the testimony against them ; prominently presenting the dying declaration of Chadwick as to the identity of two ; the positive testimony of Choate to the same effect; the testimony of a number of persons who saw the prisoners in disguise inquiring for the surveyor and Chadwick and moving towards the place where he was shot ; and the confession of all to Justice Brackett. Judge Parker fully summed up the evidence in his charge to the jury, and apparently left no escape for the prisoners. But the lengthy trial, which had now continued eight days, and the mass of testimony and weighty arguments were too much for the feebly discriminating powers of a jury formed after challenging peremp torily the most intelligent men who were called ; and the \"reason able doubt\" which the prisoners' counsel urgently claimed for them led the jury after long deliberation to come into court with out agreeing. The foreman inquired if they \"were agreed as to some of the prisoners\" but not \" as to the rest,\" would the verdict be received so far as they were agreed. The court replied declin ing to receive a verdict unless it should include all the prisoners. They again retired and after nearly two days deliberation in the whole returned a verdict of not guilty.1 1 Report of trial by John Merrick, pp. 196, printed by E. Goodale, Hallowell."], [414, "1809. 382 Town Accounts. This surprising result was thought upon the whole to be a favor able ending for the peace of the county, and the militia, as already noticed, were dismissed with the command to be ready at a moment's warning in case of alarm. The expense of the militia called into the service of the State was now to be adjusted and settled. The selectmen of the various towns from which the companies were taken, had furnished them with supplies, which amounted to $2,168.54/ as subsequently allowed. In looking into the accounts we find that the \"town's stock\" of munitions of war was not seriously \"damaged\" by the warlike operation. Augusta furnished sixty pounds of balls at ten pence per pound, and twenty pounds of English powder at six shillings; forty of the former were returned and ten of the latter ; Gardiner had expended twenty-five pounds of powder to ten pounds of balls ; Vassalborough fifteen of powder to ten of balls ; Readfield charged \"damage to town's stock of amunition\" eight dollars and fifty cents ; Fayette charged twenty dollars for the same. The commissary department of Capt. Low's company, of Vassal- borough, supplied his fifty men, which were out sixteen days, with three barrels of pork at twenty-four dollars per barrel, fifty-nine gallons of rum at eight shillings, seventeen and a half gallons of molasses at four shillings six pence, twenty-eight pounds of choco- late at forty cents, twenty-two and a half bushels of potatoes at two shillings, eight hundred pounds of ship bread at thirty-six shillings per hundred, fourteen hundred and sixty pounds of beef at thirty shillings per hundred, besides codfish and sundry small rarticles. Twenty-four gallons of rum was deducted from this account upon settlement, as were also nineteen and a half gallons from forty-eight and a half charged b}7 Fayette as furnished Capt. Palmer's company. This article, according to the custom of the times, was liberally furnished to all the companies. Souchong tea was charged at six shillings per pound and coffee at two shillings and sixpence, which was the customary price at that time. Gov. Gore, in his message in the following January, informed the legislature of the force of three hundred men called into ser- 1 This was distributed as follows: to Augusta, $311.28; Sidney, $438.33; Vassalborough, $369.27; Pittston, $46.92; Winthrop, $354.69; Readfield, $355.66; Monmouth, $29.09; Hallowell, $339.22; Gardiner, $286.83; and Fayette, $237.25.* * Original accounts."], [415, "1809.

To the artillery officers a somewhat larger sum was allowed, and on the twenty-eighth of the same month, the \"pay roll of the several companies\" was made out and allowed, amount ing with incidentals \"for barracks and other quarters for the troops, firewood, doctor's bills, horse hire, reconnoitering parties and other matters\" to $8,187.24. This, with the bills allowed the several towns for supplies, and seventy dollars paid Gen. Sewall, made the whole cost of the war to the State eleven thousand twenty-five dollars and seventy-eight cents.1 During the progress of this famous war the following \"mock heroic \" poem appeared in the Kennebec Gazette.

Peter Ehes, the pioneer printer and newspaper publisher at Augusta, was a son of Benjamin Edes a well known printer and newspaper publisher at an early day in Boston. He came to the Fort Western settlement, in Hallowell, in 1795, and com menced the publication of the Kennebec Intelligencer in the fall of that year, in the Ezekiel Page house in which he lived. This house stood where Wendenburg's shop stood previous to the fire of 1 865, at No. 64 Water street. From this building he removed to a large store built by Col. North on the bank of the river, just below where the Meonian building now stands, and which was burnt down a few years after ; thence he went into a large three story house built by Gershom North, which stood in rear of Arch Row, which he purchased, and which was long known as the Edes house. Here he printed his paper until his removal to Bangor in"], [417, "1809. Peter Edes. 385 1815. The \"Kennebec Intelligencer\" was printed under that name till October, 1800, when it was changed to the \" Kennebec Gazette,\" and retained that name till February, 1810, at which time it became the \" Herald of Liberty,\" which name it retained until it was discontinued in the autumn of 1815, upon the removal of its proprietor from town. Edes was an ardent federalist, and in high party times was threatened with personal violence for the manifestation of his zeal in the cause. The threat he did not fail to properly notice in the Gazette. He was spirited, energetic and industrious, small in stature, with spindle shanks, his legs being quite deficient of calves, and as he dressed, according to the fash ion of the time in small clothes with long stockings to the knees, this defect was quite noticeable. When he removed to Bangor he took his types and press with him. They were moved by Ephraim Ballard with a team of six oxen. The load is said to have weighed four tons, and on account of the weakness of the Kennebec bridge it was taken across a part at a time. The journey to Bangor proved quite difficult, occupying the team three weeks in going and re turning. The \"expense of removal was only $143,\" which Edes considered quite moderate. At Bangor he commenced the publi cation of the Bangor Weekly Register, a paper which was con sidered of doubtful politics, but he probably did not so regard it, as he enquired of an Augusta correspondent \"what do the people say of my Bangor democratic paper?\" ' He seems to have been pleased with his new situation, and thought he could \"make out to live if nothing more,\" while he says at Augusta he had \" sunk property by tarrying so long with so little encouragement.\" Yet he confessed to \" disappointment in not receiving a larger number of subscribers\" to the Register. \"Owing to jealousy and rival ship,\" he remarks, \"we get no assistance from Buckstown, Bel fast, or C'astine, from which places we expected two or three hundred subscribers, but have not more than seven or eight single ones. But,\" he continues, \" they say if I will remove to Bucks town they will procure six or seven hundred subscribers for me.\" He says, again, \"we are noticed by the most respectable people of the place, we receive and return civilities, and have company enough.\" He evidently was considered of more importance at Bangor, where he had just established their first paper, than at Augusta, \u25a0Letter to Judge Fuller, Dec. 26, 1815. 25"], [418, "Solomon Vose. 1809. 386 where he had grown familiar by twenty years labor.

He soon found this was not permitted at Bangor, and writes, \"you must know the people are very strict on this day and will not let men walk out, much less boys. James was strolling about and was ordered home by the tything-men, but he would not obey them ; a complaint was lodged against me on the next day, and* I should have been obliged to pay a fine had not Judge Dutton pleaded in my behalf that I did not approve of such conduct, and so got clear.\" ' Edes published his paper about two years at Bangor, when, after a suspension of some months, it was revived by James Burton, Jr., and has been continued to the present time under various names.

He afterwards returned to Bangor and lived with a widowed daughter until his decease March 29, 1840, at the age of eighty three years. Solomon Vose was a son of Col. Joseph Vose, of Milton, Mass., a revolutionary patriot, who entered the army as captain of a com pany of infantry at the commencement of the war, and left it after seven years service with the rank of colonel. He was in some of the warmly contested battles, and had his horse shot under him twice in one engagement, but escaped death on the battle field to die, at an advanced age, on his farm in Milton, which is still in possession of the family, being improved by the widow of his son Josiah II. Vose. Solomon was educated at Harvard University where he was graduated in 1787 ; read law at Worcester with Levi Lincoln, senior, and soon after was admitted to the bar, and com menced practice at Northfield, Mass. From Northfield he removed ' Letter to Judge Fuller, July 24, 1816."], [419, "1809. Solomon Vose. 387 to Augusta in 1805, at the age of thirty-seven. Here he was suc cessful in the practice of his profession during his brief career. His arguments to court and jury, it is said, \"were plain, perspic uous, brief and direct.\" He was of good size, well proportioned, a noble figure with an impressive presence and martial bearing. His voice was deep toned and commanding, and altogether he fitly represented, in the military line, for which he had a taste, the high toned military spirit of the day. He married, September 11, 1796, Eliza Putnam Chandler, daugh ter of Rufus Chandler of Worcester. Chandler was a graduate of Harvard University, and a lawyer of some note ; he was trained under the celebrated James Putnam, whose daughter he married. Putnam was attorney general for the crown prior to the Revolu tion, during which on account of his loyalty he retired to Eng land, and at the end of the war was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. Bancroft in his history says he was considered to be the best lawyer in the Colonies. The career of Solomon Vose was suddenly ended, on the 11th day of August, 1809.

His death was a loss to the town in which he was making himself useful, and fell with a heavy hand upon his stricken widow, who was left with four young children, all boys, from the age of three to eleven years. He was buried with military and masonic honors, from the meeting house, in presence of a large concourse of people. The following lines are taken from a tribute to his memory written at the time of his death by a young man, a clerk in John Davis' office, and afterwards published with other effusions in a small volume : with fun'ral song, In sad procession, mov'd the band along. Slow, to the mansions of the Dead, they bore The Man of Worth, whom men of worth deplore. Deep, in the cell of Death, his form they laid, And painful tributes to his mem'ry paid.

Vose, wife of Solomon Vose, now \u2014 1861\u2014 fifty-two years a widow, and retaining her faculties remarkably at the advanced age of ninety years, is a fine specimen of the noble women of former days, and a connecting link between the past and the present. She was born June 1, 1771, and sat at Annapolis, Nova Scotia, when* a girl of sixteen years, under the preaching of Rev. Jacob Bailey of Pownalborough, of ante-revolutionary memory. She was, at that time, in the family of her grandfather James Putnam already mentioned, and attended with him Mr. Bailey's meetings. She says his sermons were remarkably short, rarely exceeding ten minutes, a merit which was attributed to his indolent habits. The late Judge Bridge used to say of Mrs. Vose that she was a remarkable woman, and this was evinced among other things, by her bringing up in good habits and well educat ing a family of boys, a task in which many men fail; and he might have added that these boys were seldom excelled in filial regard for their mother. Mrs. Vose retains her eyesight remarkably, never having used spectacles, and is now able to see as clearly as in her younger days. Her children were Rufus Chandler, George Howe, Richard Hamp ton and Edward Joseph.1 Benjamin Vaughan was the eldest son of Samuel Vaughan of London, a merchant engaged in commerce with the American Col onies, who came occasionally to Boston, where he married Sarah, eldest daughter of Benjamin Hallowell, a merchant of that place in extensive business and holding the office of navy agent under the British government. Mr. Vaughan was born April 30, 1751, studied at Cambridge, England ; imbibed whig principles, and became a member of Parliament. He married Miss Manning, 1 Mrs. Vose died June, 1862."], [421, "1809. Dr. Benjamin Vaughan. 389 daughter of a wealthy London merchant, who at first refused his consent to the union because Mr. Vaughan had not an indepen dent fortune, or business or profession by which he could acquire one. To obviate this objection he went to Edinburgh and studied medicine. Having prepared himself for that profession he re turned to England and was married. His father-in-law then received him as a partner in his business. During the French revolution Dr. Vaughan was a member of Parliament, and became compromised in some political movements and fled to France, from whence he was invited to return by the English government, which was disposed to overlook what he had said or done and suffer him to resume his seat in Parliament. But he would not trust them, and came to America, directing his family to follow him under the care of John Merrick, who was employed as a tutor, and who subsequently married his sister. Charles Vaughan, his brother, was in Boston when he arrived in 1796, and persuaded him to proceed to Hallowell and settle on the land derived from his maternal grandfather, Benjamin Hallowell, for whom the town was named.1 At Hallowell he engaged in agriculture, and prepared a huge nursery of fruit trees, from which they were distributed over the adjacent country. To him the county of Kennebec is indebted for much of her early progress in agriculture and the cultivation of fruits. He practiced his profession to some extent but always without pay. \" He was a man of varied and extensive learning, was a good classical scholar, and familiar with the best English and French writers.\" He was a philosopher, and corresponded with some of the most eminent writers of England for many years after he came to America. His library was extensive and valua ble, embracing many choice and rare works. The medical portion of it he gave to the Insane Hospital at Augusta. Dr. Vaughan was honored by Harvard University with the degree of LL.D. in 1801, and by Bowdoin College in 1812. He was benevolent and kind ; and was greatly beloved and respected by all classes of citizens for his great usefulness, exalted worth and many virtues. He died December 8, 1835, aged nearly eighty-five. Charles Vaughan, a brother of Benjamin Vaughan, was born in London, England, June 30, 1759. He was educated for mercantile 1 Mr. Gardiner's sketch in Hist. Soc. Coll."], [422, "1809.

He was enterprising, public spirited, social, genial, of a kind and obliging disposition, and entered into business operations of large magnitude with the greatest enthusiasm. He built a large and expensive flour mill on the Bombahook stream in Hallowell, which was in operation in 1793; and was concerned with John Sheppard in an extensive brewery which the latter built at the same place in 1796. A wharf, store and store house were also erected upon the land at Sheppard's point, on the patrimonial estate of Mr. Vaughan. John H. Sheppard, a son of Mr. Shep pard, says in Willis' Courts and Lawyers, that his father emigrated to America in about 1793, went first to Philadelphia and then to Hallowell. We find he was in Hallowell in 1792, when he was taxed with a house with a store in it, wharf, warehouse and one thousand dollars stock in trade. He must have been there as early as 1791, when he was but twenty-two years of age. Mr. Vaughan may have built the wharf and buildings before the arrival of Mr. Sheppard, but the probability is they were built by Sheppard after his arrival under Mr. Vaughan's direction. Mr. Vaughan, in company with others, of whom Jonathan Bow man of Pownalborough was one, conceived the project of building a commercial town at Jones' Eddy, on the Kennebec, about four miles below Bath. In pursuance of their plan they built wharves, store houses and dwellings, intended as a nucleus for a large com mercial place. What particular business they proposed to accom modate is not known ; but probably shipments of lumber to Eng land, receiving in return cargoes of merchandise, a business which was largely and successfully pursued at Wiscasset for many years. Their enterprise, whatever may have been its object, failed, and Mr. Vaughan becoming embarrassed by this and his operations at Hallowell, a commission of bankruptcy was issued against him in 1802. John Lowell, Jr., of Boston, in a deposition given April 7th of that year, says he had known Mr. Vaughan for more than ten years, and \"during the greater part of that time he was a merchant and got his living by buying and selling in gross.\" He did not know whether he had wholly given up the business of a merchant at that time, \" though he presumed that his embarrass-"], [423, "1809. John Merrick. 391 ments had prevented his engaging in new speculations.\" Mr. Lowell knew of a \"pretty considerable contract\" made by Mr. Vaughan since the first day of June 1800 on his own account, and that he had \" acted as factor or agent for sundry persons, more especially for this deponent, for James Odier, and for Joshua Grigby, Jr.\" After this Mr. Vaughan applied himself to the cul tivation of a farm at Hallowell on the estate assigned to his brother Benjamin to pay for advances he had made to him to carry on his enterprises. In this new field of labor he displayed his wonted vigor and activity in the introduction of improved stock selected by a skillful English farmer from the herds of England. He stocked his orchard with the choicest engrafted apple trees, and his garden with a select variety of small fruit and choice vegetables and ornamented his grounds with beautiful and rare shrubbery. All these stores of animals, fruits, vegetables and shrubbery he distributed with a liberal hand to the great benefit of the agricul tural interest of the State. It was his greatest pleasure to do good, and never was he more happy than when he conferred happiness upon others. He married Miss Apthorp of Boston, an amiable and accomplished lady. He died May 15, 1839, aged eighty years. John Merrick, long a citizen of Hallowell, was a son of Samuel Merrick of London, where John was born the 27th of April, 1766. His father died in the year following his birth. The family is said to be of Welsh origin aud of great antiquity. Mr. Merrick re ceived his academic training in the grammar school at Kidder minster, and studied divinity at a \"dissenting academy for theo logical training\" at Daventry. After completing his studies he preached as a licentiate for two years, but was never ordained. He became a tutor in Dr. Benjamin Vaughan's family in England and came with him to this country in 1796. He soon relinquished the clerical profession, returned to London in 1797 ; married in April 1798 Rebecca Vaughan, sister of Dr. Benjamin Vaughan, and returned in May of the same year and settled in Hallowell. He was elected to the Board of Overseers of Bowdoin College in 1805; was a trustee of Hallowell Academy, held town office, and was first selectman \"for many years \" and overseer of the poor for ten years. In 1809 Mr. Merrick attended the trial of the alleged mur derers of Paul Chadwick at Augusta in November of that year, and reported the trial in short hand. This was published, making an"], [424, "1809. John Merrick. 392 octavo pamphlet of one hundred and eighty-eight pages. In 1810 he was commissoned by Gov. Gore with others to reconnoiter a route for a road from the Kennebec to Quebec, by the way of the Chaudiere, and report upon its feasibility. On this examination he was engaged six weeks, during which he camped out twenty one nights, seventeen of which it rained. He was cashier of the second Hallowell and Augusta Bank at Hallowell, chartered in 1812, which post he held until the bank failed in 1821. Mr. Merrick in about the year 1830 came into possession, in right of his wife, of the unsold land in the township of Dover, in Piscata quis county, and he applied himself for many years to the sale and settlement of these lands. This brought him for ten years into the agency for the owners of wild lands in the town of Harmony. Mr. Merrick was a gentlemen of thorougli education, refined tastes, high intellectual and social culture, benevolent, public spirited, kind, courteous and gentle. He was just in all his deal ings, of excellent judgment and practical good sense, a good citi zen highly esteemed and beloved by his neighbors and friends ; few if any are remembered with more affection and regard by all classes of his fellow citizens. Mr. Merrick was tall, erect and moved with a quick easy motion. We recollect seeing him at the Kennebec dam, a few years before his death, pointing out to a companion the various points of interest where the Kennebec had swept around its barrier and cut for itself a new channel on the western shore. His form, then at over the age of ninety years, was erect, his step elastic, and his flowing long locks of a snowy whiteness resting upon his shoulders gave him an imposing and venerable appearance. He died at Hallowell October 22, 1861, aged ninety-five years. Mrs. Merrick died in July 1851. He left at his decease six children : 1. Sarah Harriet, married to John A. Vaughan of Philadelphia. 2.

The town of Augusta at this time was federal in politics, but the democrats prevailed in the county and State. Elbridge Gerry was elected governor, with a democratic House and federal Senate. The national government was also democratic, under the adminis tration of James Madison, who had the previous year attained to power. The troubles which existed with the belligerent European nations under the administration of President Jefferson were now increased and aggravated until, in 1812, war was declared with England, with the general consent and approval of the democrats and against the vehement denunciations of the federalists. The reactionary measures incident to a state of war fell upon the country, already crippled in its industry and commerce by the blighting influence of embargoes and non-intercourse, with a heavy hand. The streams of prosperity were dried at their source, and in the general depression which followed Augusta had her full measure of distress ; her wheels of industry in a measure stopped, her navigation dwindled, aud her trade nearly ceased ; and for many years her prosperity and growth were greatly retarded. The town this 'year, for the first time, decided by a majority of nineteen votes, to send two representatives to the legislature, and elected Samuel Howard and Jonathan Bond. With the exception of two years, 1815 and '17, two representatives were elected until separation, when, under the first apportionment for Maine, the town was entitled to but one. Seth Williams, Beriah Ingraham and Lewis Hamlen were reflected selectmen. This was the seventh consecutive year of Williams' election, the sixth of In graham's and fifth of Hamlen's. Measures were taken, at the May meeting, to provide a town house. The town meetings had latterly been held in the court house. The old meeting-house was out of repair and ruinous in appearance, and since it ceased to be occupied was regarded as"], [426, "1810.

The Court of Sessions, in laying out Winthrop street, had excepted the build ing \"from being a nuisance, and from liability to be indicted as such, so long as it shall be made use of and considered a public building.\" The parish having completed and dedicated their new house of worship voted unanimously, \"that they would not use the old meeting-house for public worship or for any other public purpose, and that they no longer considered it a public building.\" * This was a finishing blow to the fate of the old structure, which was taken down by Jason Livermore, highway surveyor,2 and the materials sold to Lewis Hamlen, to pay the expense of its removal. The town now voted to purchase the materials of Hamlen for one hundred and seventy-six dollars, and with them erect a town house on a lot on \" Winthrop road, near the pound,\" purchased of Joseph North for fifty dollars. Direction was given to have the house erected \" in as cheap manner as can be done.\" The house was erected on the lot now owned by Joseph Anthony, at the corner of Elm and Winthrop streets. A floor was put in level with the galleries, and the upper part, which was used for town meet ings, was reached by stairs in the porch, which in its new location was in the rear of the building. The house was first occupied by the town, for a special meeting, December. 25, 1811, and continued to be occupied for municipal purposes until it was sold and removed from the lot on which it stood, in 1848. The '4th of July was celebrated this year by both the democrats and federalists. The democrats assembled in the front yard of Capt. Joshua Gage's house, now the residence of I. D.

At the Kennebec tavern \" they partook of an excellent entertainment served up in style for the occasion.\" According to the Herald of Liberty, which had an eulogistic account of the celebration, seventeen regular toasts were drank to which the \"artillery\" loudly responded. The Herald did not mention the democratic celebration, but admitted to its columns a lengthy ac count of an evening festival held by the federalists at Hallowell, who decorated the hall in Kidder's tavern, in which they dined, with seventeen united circular wreaths of evergreen, emblematic of the federal union. The wreaths representing the States of Delaware and Connecticut were distinguished by white roses, probably on account of the purity of their federalism. In the Virginia wreath was hung a hornet's nest, representing the stinging nature of her democracy, and a list of American vessels captured by France. It is mentioned as an incident of the occasion that the nest acci dentally caught fire, from a candle, and liberated the hornets as the sixteenth toast was drank. This toast was \"One hundred and thirty-three American ships piratically seized to furnish the expenses of the imperial wedding.

It is said that during the invasion of Spain by the French in 1809, some of the valuable crown flock were sold to raise money, and that Jarvis purchased fourteen hundred head of them and sent them to this country, and this was the origin of the immense flock of fine wool sheep in the United States at the present time. Williamson says, however, that David Humphrey, ambassador to Spain, imported in 1801 one hundred merino sheep from that country.1 Specimens of the wool were left with John Davis, Augusta, and Joseph Wingate, Hallowell. About this time commenced the \"Merino fever,\" which had a run of some four years. It was a captivating speculation in which considerable money was made and lost.

The finest grades of Merino wool had reached the extraordinary price of two dollars per pound in 1813, when wool of native breeds was at three shillings and sixpence.

Notwithstanding the salutary effect which the trial of the mur derers of Chadwick must have had upon the settlers, they still resisted, in the hope that they might withhold the Kennebec Pro prietors from their possessions a sufficient length of time to allow the statute of limitations to operate in their favor. In order to prevent this the Plymouth Company, on the 8th of February, petitioned the legislature to \"revise the Acts of Government limit ing actions for recovery of Real Estate,\" with a view to its exten sion, or make such modification as would defeat the \"nefarious designs\" of the settlers. The petition fully states the reasons for the application, and is interesting for the historical matter which it contains. They allude to the efforts of \"the late Colony of New Plymouth,\" of whom they purchased, in commencing settlements on the Ken nebec, and for their protection building a fort at Atkins' bay, near the mouth of the river, and their being driven off by the savages, as were all the white inhabitants to the eastward of the town of Wells. The proprietors were not able to re-commence the settlements until the year 1750, from which time they used the most active exertions for settling and improving the patent. In the year 1752 they imported, at great expense, a number of German families from Holland, set them down upon their tract, gave them lands, advanced them money and provisions, and built a stockade fort, called Frankfort, within the town of Dresden, \"and supplied it with several pieces of cannon and one hundred stand of small arms for their protection against the savages.\" They also built \"another respectable fortress near Cushnoc falls, called Fort West ern, consisting of two block-houses and a musket-proof barrack one hundred feet in length, forty feet in breadth1 and two stories high, and supplied the same with artillery and small arms.\" \"At the treaty of peace made with the Norridgewock and other eastern tribes of Indians, in the year 1753, the original Indian 1 It was and now is but thirty-six feet wide."], [432, "1810.

They had \"given away to actual settlers not less than three hundred thou sand acres of these lands, and had expended not less than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars\" in promoting settlements on their lands, by which they increased the population and tax able property of the State. In meeting the conciliating disposi tion of government, they had lately made great sacrifices in quiet ing great numbers of persons, for trifling considerations, who had illegally set down upon their lands. At this time \" almost the whole of their tract was held in sev eralty, leaving only a small portion thereof for a final division, and for the liquidation and payment of their just debts.\" In this state of their affairs, they say \"it is with great grief and reluct ance your petitioners find themselves constrained to represent that their endeavor to close their affairs, and to settle and divide their small remaining estate, has been and still is greatly obstructed by persons who have illegally and unwarrantably set down there on, who have threatened their persons, interrupted their surveyors, pursued their agents, and even offered all manner of violence to persons who shall acknowledge their legal title, refusing either to purchase themselves or to suffer others to do it, with the declared view of holding by force and violence the tracts or parcels of land on which they are set down, in order to avail themselves of the acts of government limiting the recovery of real estate until such time as they shall be able by law to exclude the rights and claims of your petitioners to the property for which your petitioners and their ancestors have devoted so much time, labor and expense.\" \"Your petitioners, therefore, in behalf of themselves and for their grantees, most humbly pray your honors to revise the acts of gov ernment limiting actions for recovery of real estate ; that they may be so modified as to prevent persons of the aforesaid description from iniquitously availing themselves of the law to favor their nefarious designs, not less hostile to the rights of individuals, than destructive to the first principles of civilized society.\" ' Ar extension of the time limiting actions for the recovery of real 1 Company Records, Feb 8, 1810."], [433, "1810. \" Rest and Residue\" of hand Sold. 401 estate would have been the only modification serviceable to the company. The General Court probably concluded that lengthen ing the time would prolong the contest between proprietors and settlers, which it was desirable for the peace of the country should be speedily settled, and that the object of the proprietors could be more effectually accomplished by providing for the enforcement of existing laws ; and on the 6th of March we find a stringent law was passed \" for the more speedy and effectual suppression of tumults and insurrections in the commonwealth.\" This act pro vided for the employment of a military force in the service of writs and precepts and in making surveys under orders of court ; and made it highly penal for any person to disguise himself in the likeness of Indians, or in any other manner with the intention of resisting the execution of the laws ; and any soldier refusing to perform the duty required of him under the act was made liable to indictment and heavy fine. The law appears to have been framed with a view to the exigency of the case, and doubtless had its effect in deterring the settlers from further violence in asserting their rights. The Plymouth Company proceeded to close their affairs, but the final adjustment was delayed for some years In 1816 they advertised to sell at public auction the \"rest and residue\" of their lands, which were finally sold, on the 22d day of January, to Thomas L. Winthrop of Boston, who afterwards sold one half of his purchase to James Bridge and Reuel Williams of Augusta, which they held in equal shares. Thus ended the connection of the Plymouth Company with the settlements and land titles on the Kennebec, after sixty-three years from the incorporation of the company, and one hundred and fifty-five years from the time of the original purchase from the colony of New Plymouth. The Kennebec country was fortunate in the men who held the title to its lands. They were men of elevated character, enlightened views, and of a liberal spirit. We are favorably impressed with the liberal and enlightened policy which guided their efforts in settling the country. They assisted the government in its early struggles with Indians incited and assisted in their hostility by the French, and led the way in territorial defence with their forts. They gave large tracts of land to settlers to induce them to occupy and hold the country, and promoted the cause of religion and education by provisions in their grants for the main- 26"], [434, "1810. 402 Road to Quebec. tenance of both. The class of settlers which the influence of the proprietors sent upon the river has not been surpassed in any section of the State ; and the thrift for which the inhabitants on the Kennebec have been noted is attributable, in a large measure, to the character of its early settlers. The records of the Plymouth Company remained with Reuel Williams at Au gusta, until after his death, when in accordance with his pre viously expressed wish they were deposited with the Maine His torical Society at Brunswick, where they will remain increasing in historical interest as they grow old in years. It was thought at this time that a road from the Kennebec to Quebec, by way of the Chaudiere, would be an important avenue from the Atlantic ocean to Canada, and be the means of settling the public lands on the upper waters of the Kennebec. Nathan Dummer and others of Hallowell petitioned the General Court to appoint commissioners to explore aud lay out a road in the general direction indicated. In response to this, the General Court, on the third of March of this year, authorized Gov. Gore to appoint three commissioners to explore and layout \"a road four rods wide in the most convenient and direct route from Kennebec river to the north boundary of this commonwealth, in a direction to the nearest settlements on the river Chaudiere.\" The commissioners were empowered to employ surveyors and other assistants, and directed to \"return a correct plan, with a particular description\" of the road.1 The governor appointed on this commission Lothrop Lewis of Gorham, Joshua Cushman of Winslow and John Merrick of Hallowell. Subsequently Charles Turner of Scituate and James Stackpole of Watorville were substituted for Lewis and Cushman. The commissioners took with them one surveyor, and several hands to carry provisions, utensils and instruments, and an Indian guide. Mr. Merrick took a young man, David Morgan, as his private attendant. Fully equipped they started, and having reached their point of departure from the Kennebec entered the wilderness, camping and sleeping on a bed of boughs at night. They reached the Canada line without incident of note, when two of the com missioners, Turner and Stackpole, alleged that they had completed the work assigned them by the General Court and would proceed no further. Mr. Merrick, the other commissioner, having letters 1 Resolve March 3, 1810."], [435, "1810. \" Awickheegan .\" 403 to Sir James Craig, Governor of Canada, was desirous of proceed ing and interesting him in the construction of the provincial part of the road. The other commissioners with the surveyor and assistants having lest on their return, Mr. Merrick with Morgan and the Indian guide and with a small quantity of provisions pro ceeded on to Quebec, where he was courteously received by the Governor who highly approved of the object, and ultimately through his influence the road in Canada was completed. After a week at Quebec, Mr. Merrick with his Indian guide and Morgan started to return. When they reached a place where the commissioners who had returned were to deposit provisions for their use they found to their dismay that none had been left. At this time they had a few cakes of portable soup and a few beans, and had yet to undergo a tramp of several days through the wil derness. The Indian refused to partake of their scanty supply of provisions, and soon after left them to look out for himself, saying: \"Give me fish-hook; me Indian.\" During this expedition Mr. Merrick met with \"picture-writing\" in Indian hieroglyphic figures. It was drawn on a chip with char coal, and represented a birch canoe with two Indians in the attitude of exertion, a squaw with a pappoose and bundles of baggage ; over all was a bird on the wing. This was firmly fastened in the cleft of a stake from which hung a bag of dried beans. Mr. Mer rick described this to an Indian pilot as he was crossing the St. Lawrence. He said it was called \"Awickheegan,\" and must have been left by a party of Indians for the information of their friends. He gave him the interpretation. The attitude of exertion showed that they were going up stream. They intended to remain during the hunting season, because they had their family and furniture in the canoe. The bird, he was satisfied from the description, was a loon. \"That bird expressed the intention of the party to go to the place agreed upon without stopping anywhere before they arrived ; as the loon, from the shortness of its legs, walking with great dif ficulty, never alighted on its way.\" Mr. Merrick was about six weeks on this journey.1 It appears that this road was not made in 1817, although the commissioners for the sale and settlement of the public lands gave notice, in that year, of an intention to lay out two townships on the \"great thoroughfare road from Kennebec to Quebec.\" The 1 Memoir of Mr. Merrick, by Rev.

Benjamin Tappan Ordained. 404 road was eventually made from the forks of the Kennebec to the Canada line, and a mail established on the route, and a custom house at the boundary ; but the expectations of great benefit to arise from it were never realized. The South parish, at its annual meeting this year, raised $1,300 for preaching and other parish purposes, and exempted, by a unanimous vote, the Rev. Daniel Stone from the payment of parish taxes. The last year's committee for procuring preaching, Whit well, Eveleth and Guild, was continued. The Rev. Benjamin Tappan, a young man who was then a tutor in Bowdoin College, and son of the then late Professor of Divinity at Harvard Univervity, supplied the pulpit so acceptably for a number of Sabbaths in the early part of this year that, on the third day of June, the parish gave him a call to settle, at a salary of seven hundred dollars. His answer accepting the call was read to the parish Sunday August 11th, at which time eighty dol lars were collected by contribution for the relief of the sufferers by the then late fire at Newburyport. October sixteenth was fixed for the ordination of Mr. Tappan, at which time six of the ten clergymen invited attended and offi ciated. The Rev. W. E. Channing of Boston made the introduc tory prayer ; Rev. Dr. Appleton, President of Bowdoin College, preached the sermon from John ix. 39 ; Rev. Ebenezer Jenks of Bath made the ordaining prayer ; Rev. Hezekiah Packard of Wis casset delivered the charge ; Rev. Freeman Parker of Dresden gave the right hand of fellowship ; and the Rev. Mr. Bailey made the concluding prayer. A person who was present records that \" the weather was wet above, but the scene was solemn and de lightful within.\" The Liberty Herald, in commenting upon the event, remarked that \"the solemnity of the occasion, notwith standing the inclemency of the weather, drew together an immense concourse of people, who behaved with the greatest decorum and order, and bestowed during the whole of the exercises the most fixed attention. It was a grateful sight to the christian philoso pher to see so many men, on a common business day, turn aside from the perplexing cares of this world to the more weighty con cerns of another, and to observe a whole parish, heretofore dis united in religious sentiments and institutions, unanimous in con ferring all their pastoral charge on a man who, under Providence, seemed destined to cause brethren to dwell together in unity.\""], [437, "- 1 y Parish Prospers. \u2014 Democratic Reforms. 405 The new minister entered upon his pastoral duties with praise worthy diligence. To his Sunday services he added a weekly lecture at private houses ; and prayer and conference meetings, -alternating weekly, were held at the dwellings of a number of the members of the church. Contributions were statedly taken for the poor, and in April of the next year a committee, consisting of the pastor, John Eveleth and Joshua Gage, was chosen by the parish to disburse the funds thus collected. The parish continued to prosper and was strengthened under the faithful services of their new pastor. The \" liberal \" element, however, manifested itself after a few years in obtaining an act to incorporate \"a union religious society,\" under which no proceedings except organizing were had, and it was many years before other societies came into existence. In April, 1813, the parish declined to \"take measures to pro cure stoves for the purpose of warming the meeting-house ;\" and as late as 1818 services one Sunday in January and three in Feb ruary were held in the court house on account of the cold weather, means not having been provided to warm the meeting-house.' Soon after this, the Rev. Mr. Tappan and Reuel Williams provided a stove for the purpose. An account for twenty-seven boxes of glass for the meeting house, amounting to $421.79, settled with Peter T. Vose, who had failed, was found to be unpaid, and judgment was recovered against the parish for the amount, which very naturally created gome feeling as well as difficulty in payment ; but Mr. Tappan, to assist in the latter and help quiet the former, very liberally pro posed to relinquish one hundred dollars of his salary if the parish would raise by tax an amount sufficient to pay the judgment, to which they thankfully acceded. This year the democrats prevailed in the State, reelecting Gov. Gerry and each branch of the legislature by a decided majority. They now felt themselves so strong as to commence works of reform, and the legislature passed the \" religious freedom bill,\" which gave to unincorporated religious societies the same powers and privileges as those made corporate by law, and established the Circuit Court of Common Pleas to take the place of the Dis trict Court. One of the three circuits established in Maine, called the Second 1 Sewall's Diary."], [438, "State Pay Representatives. 1811. 406 Eastern Circuit, embraced Lincoln, Kennebec and Somerset coun ties. The district judges now went out of office, and Nathan Weston, Jr., of Augusta, Benjamin Ames of Bath and Judah Mc- Lellan of Bloomfield were appointed for this circuit. The first two were democrats, the last a federalist : McLellan, however, declined, and Ebenezer Thatcher was appointed. The Court of Sessions was reestablished, and the governor and council were authorized to appoint clerks for the courts in each county. A State bank was created, having William Gray and other Bos ton capitalists for corporators, with a capital of three millions of dollars in addition to such sums as the Commonwealth might sub scribe. The legislature was to appoint directors of the bank in proportion to the capital subscribed by the State. Wholesome and restrictive rules and regulations were provided for its manage ment, to which all hanks upon the renewal of their charters became subject. It was thought that the State had been exclusive in its favors in relation to bank charters, and the democrats did not hes itate to say \"that hitherto banking had been a federal monopoly.\" A new districting of the State for Senators, under the recent census, was very annoying to the federalists, who charged their opponents with so arranging it as to unfairly favor the election of democratic senators. They particularly ridiculed the division of Essex county, which was portrayed as resembling an animal which they named, from the democratic governor, Gerrymander. The representatives to the General Court were, till this time, paid for their attendance by the towns sending them ; now it was provided by law that they should be paid out of the public treasury. By these measures of reform, some of which were wholesome and necessary, the democrats became a party of progress ; yet so acrimonious was party feeling that the federalists could see in them only party measures, adopted to increase and strengthen party power. The democrats, however, lost power the next year, and did not regain it while Maine was united with Massa chusetts. The block of three brick stores on the north side of Market square previous to the fire of 1865 was built this year by Ben jamin Whitwell, Bartholomew Nason and Joshua Gage. This was the second brick block built in town. The ownership of the tenements was assig-ned by lot.

The house of representatives continued democratic, but the senate was federal. Paying the representa tives from the public treasury increased their number. The year before, six hundred and sixty-four members were returned, of whom one hundred and sixty-nine were from Maine ; this year the num ber was increased to seven hundred and forty-five, with two hun dred and fourteen from Maine. John Davis and George Crosby were elected to represent Augusta, but Davis, after serving one session, was appointed clerk of the courts, an office which he had held from the organiza tion of the county till the appointment of Joseph Chandler, by Gov. Gerry, under the new law of 1811. Davis was now re appointed by Gov. Strong and returned from the General Court with his commission in his pocket. Henry W. Fuller was chosen representative in September to fill the vacancy at the October session created by Davis' appointment. England continued her aggressions on our commerce, impress ing our seamen and insulting our flag. Bonaparte had receded from his \"predatory policy,\" which had the intended effect of com plicating our difficulties with England, who still viewed our for bearance \"as weakness, and our small navy with contempt.\" The administration of President Madison, in view of impending war, on the 4th of April laid an embargo, for ninety days, on shipping. This was followed on the 18th of June by Congress declaring war to exist with Great Britain. This event, so long delayed as to justly arouse the indignation of an insulted and out raged people, was violently denounced by the federalists, who said it was iniquitous, ruinous, and not to be tolerated, and when the news reached Augusta some of the federalists manifested their party feelings of abhorence by hanging Madison, in e&gy, on the wharf.

The soldiers again formed and marched to the flag-staff, threatening its destruction, \"hut discovering the invincible spirit of the citizens dared not cut it away.\" There would probably have been \" blood shed,\" said the Herald, had not the \"civil authority interfered.\" The flag was kept flying, \" as a proper expression of feeling for the space of two days.\" * The Herald, in mourning and bitterness of spirit declared, \"with agony of soul we are compelled \u2014 reluctantly compelled \u2014 to announce the melancholy and overwhelming tidings of a Declar ation of WAR,\" a war without adequate object or prospect of an honorable result. \"Alas !

A fast, appointed for July 23d, on account of the war was observed in town by \" a very general\" attendance upon public worship.3 There was a fever, at this time, for manufacturing and banking corporations, incited as respects the former by the enhanced prices arising from the embargo, non-intercouse and war, and in ' Herald of Liberty, July 1, 1812.

The bank charters, with the exception of those recently granted, expired by limitation in October of this year. They were renewed, subject to the rules and regulations established for the State Bank, and with a uni form limitation expiring October, 1831, and were subject to an annual tax of one per cent, on their capital stock, payable to the State. One of the thirty-two banks chartered June 23d\u2014 most of which were renewals \u2014 was the Kennebec Bank, the first banking institu tion located in Augusta. It in reality was a Hallowell bank, under Hallowell management, and in Hallowell interest. It could not have been chartered to be located in Hallowell, for the second Hal lowell and Augusta Bank at that place was chartered at the same time, and more than one bank in a town of the size of Hallowell was not permitted. The latter bank was federal and the new bank democratic. The capital stock of the Kennebec Bank was fixed at $100,000. Its corporators were John Chandler, Benjamin Dear born, Ariel Maun, E. T. Warren and Joshua Gage. The first meeting for organizing was required to be called by notice pub lished in the \"American Advocate printed in Hallowell.\" E. T. Warren was the first and only president. Joseph Chandler the first cashier was soon succeeded by Jesse Robinson. A brick banking house was erected on Court street opposite the old court house, and near where the steps from Court street ascend to the present court house. In it the bank transacted business until 1816, when upon petition to the legislature repre senting the Kennebec Bank to be a Hallowell institution, its removal to that place was authorized February 8th of that year. The bank building was afterwards sold to the county and taken down when the present court house was enlarged in 1851. Pre viously it had been long used as a dwelling. The bank failed May 1, 1826; Warren, its president, having become at that time deeply involved in speculations in western lands which carried him down. An unusual snow storm prevailed May 6th. The snow was thrown by a violent wind into drifts. The amount that fell was \" differently estimated at from six to eighteen inches on a level.\" The ground was previously much frozen.

W. Ripley's regiment, and while the colonel was conversing with him a cannon ball passed between them carrying away Ripley's sword.

The federal Gov. Strong was this year reflected by an increased majority, and the legislature was decidedly of the same politics, but the District of Maine and the county of Kennebec were demo cratic. The federalists now repealed the law paying the represen tatives from the public treasury, as they thought it favored an increased representation from the country towns, which were mostly democratic, and made it penal to \"choose and return\" more than the constitutional number,1 and districted anew the State for senators to remedy the injustice alleged to have been done by the Gerrymandering of their opponents. The \"Sons of Peace,\" who were federalists, were opposed to the war, and did, according to the democrats, what they could to discourage and embarrass the national administration in its prose cution. Maine was not in sympathy with this feeling, and fur nished more troops by enlistment, it is said, than any other State in proportion to her population, and \" paid with patriotic spirit\" the various direct taxes levied upon her by Congress. Towns having one hundred and fifty ratable polls were entitled to one representative, and to an additional one for every additional two hundred and twenty-five polls. Yet Augusta, having three hundred and thirty-two polls, this year decided by a large majority to send two representatives, and elected George Crosby and Seth Williams. At a meeting held in August, one of the articles for consideration was to see if the town would petition the legisla ture to call a convention of the people to amend the constitution so as to diminish the number of representatives. A committee was chosen, consisting of George Crosby, Pitt Dillin^ham and Joshua Gage, to report a draft of a petition for this purpose at an adjourned meeting, to which it was presented and adopted. In the petition they say \"they have seen with regret, for some years past, au increase of the number of representatives beyond all reasonable bounds, increasing the public burdens, as well as op posing obstacles to the despatch of public business.\" Their effort however, for a change was unavailing. The price of all commercial articles and domestic productions was greatly enhanced by the war.

In May of this year, the price current at Boston quoted corn at $1.70; rye, $2.30; flour, $17.00 ; oats, 75 cents ; beans, $2.20. The coasting trade was seriously interrupted by the enemy's cruisers. Vessels, stole along the shore, from point to point, but were not always successful in avoiding them. On the seventh of June, sloop Mary of Augusta, Capt. Moody Thurlow, with a cargo of merchandize valued at $5,000 belonging to the captain, John Soule and Alexander Orrock, traders at Augusta, sailed from Boston, and on the next day when off Cape Neddock, was captured by the English schooner Retaliation of five guns with thirty-four men, and sent to Liverpool, N. S. On the next day Capt. Thurlow and his men were put on board the sloop Ranger and landed at Bath.1 A privateer, named \" Dart,\" owned by a company of citizens, was built at Bond's brook this year. She was armed with a swivel and muskets, and was designed to seize merchantmen. She made one trip to the mouth of the river for that purpose, and espied a noble craft there awaiting capture, but while she was ascertaining the character of the vessel, a friendly privateer approached and secured the prize, taking her to Bath, where, it is said, this mode of introducing goods paid well.2 The Dart's career was short. She was employed as an armed merchantman, and was after the war cast away on Rye beach while in command of Capt. Thurlow in the ignoble business of canying potatoes to Boston. In the spring of this year, the town valuation showed a number of persons to have been engaged in trade. John S. Kimball and Joseph Chandler were each valued for $600 in trade. Kimball had formerly kept a small store in Judge Weston's office, at the foot of Court street, but just before the declaration of war had united with Chandler in purchasing a large stock of goods, which were opened in the store vacated by Vose & Wales, in Kennebec tavern, where they were sold at a large profit, having been greatly enhanced in price by the war. Samuel R. Nason & Co. were assessed $300. Alexander Orrock, and the firm of Soule & Thurlow were each assessed $200 ; but probably their trading ended with the capture 1 Herald of Liberty, and Capt.

Eveleth & Child had dissolved the previous year, and were engaged in pur chasing cattle ; they were assessed $200. The amount of stock in trade, including the small sums assessed to those engaged in mechanical and manufacturing business, was $4,750, about half the amount of 1810. But the valuation does not furnish reliable data by which to judge of the amount of capital employed in trade ; for instance, Eveleth & Child formed a copartnership in 1807 with a small capital, and dissolved in 1812 with nominally $35,000 to divide, yet their highest valuation in any year was but $1,600. At this time a number of those who were in trade in 1810 had retired ; Samuel Howard temporarily, Robinson & Crosby and Eben Dutch permanently. Josiah II. Vose had gone into the army ; Vose & Wales had dissolved, and Peter T. Vose, the senior partner, had sailed in 1811, and did not again resume business in Augusta. In the fall of this year Kimball & Chandler's was the only store not closed in the place. The traders in Augusta had been largely engaged in the purchase of timber, which found its place of shipment at Wiscasset, and they were seriously crippled by the first and fatally by the second embargo and the war. The town presented at this time a desolate appearance. The five brick stores were closed, and, it is said, not a store was owned in town with the exception of Joshua Gage's. The Robinson & Crosby stores, wharf and old castle were owned in Baltimore ; the Kennebec House and connecting store in New buryport ; the old Gage store in Readfield ; the Craig store in Fayette ; the Nason store by Samuel Titcomb in Belgrade ; and the Whitwell store by some one whose name has passed from recollection.1 ' Capt. Smith of Belgrade died in town January 20, in conse quence of a casualty which befell him in the rear of the meeting house. Driving on State street in a dark night he missed the way, passed out of the road, which was not fenced, near to the meeting house and \"over the precipice\" in its rear; horse, sleigh and man went over the abrupt declivity, which then existed from digging away the bank to form Bridge street. 1 Benjamin Davis, Esq."], [446, "1813. 414 Union Religious Society. The records of the county were kept in the wooden court house until this year, when, for their better security, a brick \"fire proof building,\" with four fire proof vaults, was erected at the southwest corner of the present court house lot. This building had brick floors, with brick partitions to the vaults, which had iron doors, and was doubtless very secure against accidental fire from within, but many years afterwards, when it was taken down, much to the surprise of the county authorities, it was found that the brick floor ing and covering to the vaults rested upon wooden flooring , and that the building could not have burned without consuming the contents of the vaults. Uneasiness in parish affairs was manifested in the spring of this year by some parochial changes. John Davis, John S. Kimball, Joel R. Ellis and Joshua Heath had certificates filed that they were members of the Episcopal Society at Gardiner ; James Burton, James Burton, Jr., Marshal Edson, Isaac Carter and a number of others had joined the Baptist Society in Hallowell ; and Japheth Beale and Elihu Robinson, a committee of the Methodist Society in Augusta, certified that Nathaniel Hamlen, Theophilus Ladd, Benjamin Piper, John Reed, Stephen Winslow and seven others were members of that society. In September, John Davis and fifty others of Augusta and Hal lowell petitioned the legislature to be incorporated as \"The Union Religious Society in Hallowell and Augusta.\" They stated in their petition, which was served upon each town, \"that they ex perience many inconveniences in regard to their parochial connec tions in their respective towns ; that they have associated together and subscribed to a fund for the purpose of supporting public wor ship, and for erecting a suitable meeting-house.\" This meeting house, in order to accommodate the residents of both villages, was to be erected on the \"Betsey Howard lot,\" the lot numbered one in Augusta. Corporate powers were granted June 13, 1814, with authority to assess its members to create a fund for the support of a minister of \"piety, religion and morality.\" The society organized May 1, 1815, at a meeting called at the court house for that purpose, by warrant from Nathaniel Perley ; when John Davis was chosen moderator ; Robert C. Vose, clerk ; Joseph Chandler, Gideon Farrell and Thomas B. Cooledge, assessors ; Jesse Robin son, treasurer ; and Francis Norris, collector. John Davis, E. T. Warren and Joel R.

Coast Blockaded.\u2014 War Meeting. 415 consider generally the concerns of the parish, and to report at the next meeting of the society.\" ' It is not known that the \"next meeting\" was ever called. The society \"fell through,\" probably from the impracticable nature of the undertaking. The commencement of this year was gloomy in the extreme ; all imported articles continued extravagantly high. Breadstuffs were scarce and difficult to obtain, and a spirit of speculation was rife, induced by exorbitant and fluctuating prices. Congress, in March, repealed all restrictive laws, which, however, did not prove an adequate measure of relief to commerce, as in April the British Admiral declared the coast, which was infested by the enemy's cruisers, in a state of blockade. President Madison, at this juncture, made a requisition upon the -States for \"provisional detachments from the militia for purposes of defence,\" to be placed under officers of his appointment. This was disregarded by Gov. Strong, on the ground that under United States officers they could be marched beyond the limits of the State and thus leave it un protected. The British fleet hovering on the coast seized upon Eastport, June eleventh, and opened trade there. This was followed, Sep tember first, by the enemy taking Castine and ascending the Penobscot to Bangor. The Adams, a United States vessel of war in the Penobscot, escaped up that river and was burned by Capt. Morris, her commander, to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy. Her crew retired through the woods to the Kennebec, causing alarm by the rumor that the enemy were approaching in that direction. On Saturday, September 10th, a special town meeting was called \"to take into consideration the alarming situation of the country, and adopt such measures in relation thereto as the town in their wisdom should think fit.\" At this meeting a committee to con sider the subject, consisting of George Crosby, Joshua Gage, John Davis, Thomas Rice, PittDillingham, Williams Emmons and Joseph Chandler was chosen, who reported the following vote : \"That the selectmen be empowered and directed to procure forthwith two hundred pounds of powder, such quantity of materials for tents, and such number of camp kettles and small arms as in their judg ment may be necessary and proper.\" This was passed unani- 1 American Advocate, May C, 1815."], [448, "Troops al Edgecomb. 1814. 416 mously, and five hundred dollars appropriated for the purpose was raised by a special tax. On Sunday, the day after the meeting, while in attendance upon public worship, Gen. Sewall received a dispatch by express from the \"Committee of Safety\" at Wiscasset, requesting a reinforce ment of one thousand men, and communicating information of an expected attack by the enemy, whose movements threatened a descent upon the coast. He immediately ordered two regiments of militia, Col. Stone's and Col. Sweet's with the Hallowell Artil lery to march forthwith, by companies, for Wiscasset. These orders were promptly executed, and some of the companies arrived at Wiscasset the next morning at seven o'clock. He also ordered four other regiments to move to the banks of the Kennebec, there to await further orders, and proceeded himself to Wiscasset on the fifteenth and took command of the troops. Here be was met on the nineteenth by Col. Sumner, aide-de-camp to the gov ernor and agent for the commissioners for the defence of the sea board.1 The troops had crossed the river and encamped in Edgecomb, opposite to Wiscasset, when, on the twenty-third a vidette came in with information that an English man-of-war was in the river evidently preparing to land troops. Immediately Capt. Edward Swan with his rifles from Gardiner; Capt Benjamin Dearborn with his Light Infantry from Hallowell ; Capt. Benjamin Burbank with the Augusta Light Infantry, with the company under Capt. James L. Child from Winslow, formed under command of Maj. Samuel HeAvard, and proceeded some six or eight miles to a point where it was anticipated the enemy would attempt a landing. Here they slept on their arms at night, and no enemy appearing during the following forenoon the detachment returned to camp.2 The alarm having now subsided, a draft was made of a portion of the troops of the two divisions which had been called out, the Fourth under Gen. William King and the Eighth under Gen. Henry Sewall. These were to remain forty days at Wiscasset and Bath. The alarm proved to be groundless, and the detachments were dis charged at the expiration of their term of service. The enemy retained Castine and attempted to establish between New Brunswick and the Penobscot a Province, with a government over it in their interest. They made Castine a port of entry, invited 1 Sewall's Diary. ' J. L. Child's MS."], [449, "1814. Goods by way of Castine. 417 trade there, and allowed all ports at the eastward the same privi leges as ports in the British Provinces. On the third of Novem ber a merchant fleet arrived at Castine, where provisions and lumber were exchanged at high prices for merchandise. An ex tensive illicit trade sprung ud in defiance of the efforts of the United States officers to stop it. In one instance an agent of the collector at Hampdcn seized a sleigh loaded with goods cross ing the river on the ice at that place. He was complained of for highway robbery, before a magistrate selected by the smuggler, and sent to jail at Augusta, where he was kept in close confinement until liberated on a writ of habeas corpus. Cattle which were seized while being driven to the enemy were rescued by force.1 The \"Craig store,\" at the west end of Kennebec bridge, was made a place of deposit for goods, and was occasionally filled with boxes and bales of goods which came in through the \"English port of Castine.\" They were taken to Boston in long wagons, drawn by teams of four and six^ horses. The business of thus forwarding goods continued about a year. Duties, probably at low rates, were paid on the goods as they were not disturbed by the authorities, although most of the goods sold on the river at this time were said to have been smuggled. Rum and all liquors came from Castine, and at one time the cellar of the Craig store was well filled with choice brandy awaiting a transit to Bos; In May, the sloop Friendship, John Row, master, was advertised to run from Portland to Harpswell, Brunswick and Bath, by way of New Meadows river to the \"Turnpike Bridge,\" and would thus continue \"until she could have permission to go round Small Point, and then she will run to Hallowell and Augusta as usual.\" With the exception of some small traders who sold \"rum, tobacco and cigars but no goods,\" Kimball & Chandler's was the only store in town this year. They dissolved their partnership in Sep tember. Chandler took the Whitwell store, but soon relinquished business. Kimball remained in the store connected with the Ken nebec tavern, and continued business until he sold out to his clerk. Benjamin Davis, and removed to Belfast in 1816. 4 In October of this year Samuel Titcomb sold his dwelling house on State street and about fifty acres of land, for eight thousand dollars. The westerly twenty-five acres of the lot was sold to 3 Hallowell Gazette, May 13, 1814. \u25a0'B. Davis, Esq. 1 Williamson 2, p. 655. ' Benjamin Davis, Esq. 2-"], [450, "1814. 418 Augusta Bank. John Davis for three thousand dollars, and the front twenty-five acres to Gen. Sewall, for himself and Rev. Benjamin Tappan, for five thousand dollars. Sewall took the house and north half of the land at thirty-four hundred dollars, and Mr. Tappan the south half at sixteen hundred. On this lot Mr. Tappan built his house, which he moved into November 29, 1816. The two lofty elms which now ornament State street in front of the Sewall house were set out by the General, April 21, 1826. ' In a congenial soil for rapid growth they have developed large proportions. The Aug-usta Bank, an institution which contributed to and was long identified with the prosperity of the town, was chartered January 21st of this year, with a capital of one hundred thousand dollars. Its corporators were James Bridge, William Robinson, Reuel Williams, John Eveleth, Bartholomew Nason, Samuel How ard and James Child. To promote the interests of agriculture and manufactures, which the legislature had heretofore regarded and ~were at this time attempting to foster, the bank was required to \u25a0loan one tenth part of its capital to persons engaged in these pur suits, on their personal bond secured by mortgage of real estate, in sums not less than one hundred and not more than five hundred dollars, and on time not less than one year. The time, one would think, was not auspicious for the establishment of a bank; the existing war, depression of business, and deficiency of capital seeking investment were obstacles which would have deterred less courageous men than those having it in hand from embark ing in the undertaking. But a portion of the subscription to the capital stock was satisfied, for the time being, by stock notes, and the anticipation of large profits arising from bank ing, as well as the local accommodation required, induced an \u25a0unexpected subscription in excess of the capital within thirty days from the date of the charter. The corporators acted -promptly ; met with their associates at Kennebec tavern, kept by Theophilus Hamlen, on February 22d, and chose Pitt Dillingham moderator, and Henry W. Fuller secretary, when seven directors \u25a0were chosen, James Bridge, Daniel Cony, John Davis, Benjamin Brown, Jr., John Eveleth, Samuel Wood and Thomas W. Smith. The directors were then authorized to purchase a lot of land, build a banking house, and procure the necessary means to put the 1 Sewall's Diary."], [451, "1814. Augusta Bank. 419 bank in operation. After apportioning the stock to the subscri bers, and directing a percentage to be paid and deposited in the Kennebec Bank, the meeting dissolved. The directors now chose James Bridge president, and George Crosby cashier, and purchased of Judge North a lot of land on Water street, on which they erected a substantial brick building, two stories high with a hip-roof after the fashion of the times. Two secure stone vaults were constructed, and the floors of the banking rooms and offices over them were laid with brick. The stockholders held their first meeting in the new building October 3d, and chose the same board of directors with the exception of Samuel Wood, in whose place Hartwell Williams was elected. The bank now went into operation with the president and cashier first elected, and soon acquired a high reputation as a sound and well managed institu tion. Discounts were made at this time almost exclusively on accommodation paper, and with the expectation that the amount would be paid in installments of twenty-five per cent, at each renewal, unless the borrower happened to be a depositor when so large a payment was not required. Discounts were made only on the regular weekly discount day, and then upon a vote of the directors taken with black and white balls \u2014 and they were careful that each should not know how the others voted. One black ball prevented a discount. Judge Bridge continued president of the bank for twenty years, until his decease in 1834. During this long period he managed its affairs with great credit to himself and with profit to the stock holders. He was assisted by George Crosby, as cashier, who had rare qualifications for the place, and was an accomplished account ant. In Judge Bridge's estimation integrity of character, industry and correct habits entitled the young men of the town to moderate discounts. Spring and fall they were accommodated with an ac customed sum apportioned to the extent of their business. This they could depend upon. Business was fostered, young men encouraged, and a foundation laid for that commercial integrity which soon placed the credit of Augusta merchants above re proach. Daniel Williams, son of Capt. Seth Williams, an early settler, succeeded Judge Bridge as president, which office he held to 1841, when Thomas W. Smith, who had resided thirty-five years in town, and had been for twenty-seven years a director, was elected and held the office until his decease in 1855; when Samuel"], [452, "1815. 420 Peace . \u2014 Rejoicing. Cony, son of Gen. Samuel Cony and grandson of Dr. Daniel Cony a \"prop\" and stay of the town in its early days, was elected and continued in office until the bank surrendered its charter in 1864. Mr. Crosby, the first cashier, was one of the early merchants of the place. He retired upon his removal to Baltimore, Md., and was succeeded by George W. Allen, who continued until January, 1849, when Joseph J. Eveleth, son of Dea. John Eveleth, an early merchant of the town and one of the first board of direc tors, was elected, and held the office until the affairs of the bank were closed. In 1848 the bank sold its banking-house and lot to Reuel Williams and George W. Stanley for four thousand dol lars. On its site they erected the Stanley House, and provided a banking-room in the building for the accommodation of the bank. News of the treaty of peace, signed at Ghent December 24th of the last year, was received in this country February 11th, with the liveliest demonstrations of joy. Bells were rung and bonfires kindled, and illuminations and festive demonstrations testified the general joy of the people. In sixty hours the gratifying news reached Augusta from New York, having come by express to Portland, and from thence by mail February 14th, when the over joyed citizens mounted a boat on a sled, drawn by oxen, manned by young men in sailor costume, and with flags flying and instru ments of music playing national airs, moved through the principal streets. This was rudely emblematic of the return of commerce as one of the blessings of peace. On Wednesday, the twenty second of the same month, the citizens generally assembled in the forenoon in the meeting-house to devoutly offer their thanks givings to the Ruler of nations, who had vouchsafed to them the return of unnumbered blessings after the severe chastisement of war. The Rev. Benjamin Tappan led the devotional exercises and addressed the meeting. On the 13th of April a national thanksgiving was observed at the same place on account of the same event. The stores in Augusta, now that the arts of peace were resum ing their sway, began to be filled, trade revived, and all articles of necessity and many of luxury, which had for a number of years been purchased at the better supplied stores of Hallowell, were now obtained in town. Joel R. Ellis had taken Robert C. Vose"], [453, "1815. Business Men. \u2014 Direct Tax. 421 as a partner, and they were selling goods at the old Bond store opposite the factory. Hartwell Williams, a brother of Reuel Wil liams, and Joseph B. Bridge, a brother of Judge Bridge, had formed a copartnership, and were trading in the old Craig store at the west end of the bridge, where \"they sold a large amount of goods,\" and failed after a few years. William Bridge, an other brother of Judge Bridge, traded in the office formerly occu pied by the Judge, but he soon closed his affairs and removed to Baltimore. Amos Nichols, who was in company with John Davis, traded in the brick store occupied before the great fire by John Means, under the name of Amos Nichols & Co. In a short time they retired, and sold their goods to Bartholomew Nason, who con tinued business many years in the same store. Charles Williams, who commenced business during the war, now traded largely in the store built by Isaac Carter which stood on the south side of Winthrop street where the railroad now passes. Thomas W. Smith was also extensively engaged in trade in the store on the east side of Water street next south of the old Titcomb house, as was also John S. Kimball in the store connected with the Kennebce House. William B. Johnson, in the north tenement of the Robin son & Crosby store, had largely increased his business, and soon received Pitt Dillingham into a short copartnership. Thomas and Abner Elmes were manufacturing hats aud \"beaver bonnets,\" which were much in fashion with the ladies at this time, in the building which stood on Winthrop street west of the Kennebec House. Dr. E. S. Tappan had opened an office and kept a small drug store at the foot of Court street; and Rev. Daniel Stone kept a few books and the post office in a store next south of the Ken nebec House. Although the war was ended, taxation to pay its heavy ex penses continued. This was by a direct tax on lands and dwell ing-houses, and specific taxes on household furniture, watches and stamps, on retailers, manufacturers and carriages. A note of hand was not valid without a stamp, which cost from twenty five cents to a dollar and a quarter, according to the amount of the note. Daniel Evans, father of the Hon. George Evans, was collector in the fourth collection district. He certified to the amount of internal duties imposed by the United States in this year on"], [454, "Cony Female Academy. 1815. 422 the following residents of Augusta, \" excepting on household furniture, on watches and on stamps :\" James Child, $22.98 ; G.

Smith, $37.50; Church Williams, $36,46; Williams & Bridge, $37.50; Reuel Williams, $2 00 ; and Nathan Weston, $1.00. Judge Cony commenced a building, this year, at the corner of what is now Bangor and Cony streets which had the appearance of being intended for a dwelling, yet \" what could the Judge want of a house in that location ?\" was the inquiry ; no one could answer as no one ventured to ask him. Shortly, as the work progressed, a tower began to appear. Then it was said, \"the building is in tended for a meeting-house.\" But what could he want of a meet ing house ? However, under this delusion the curious labored until seats and desks began to go in, when they came to the con clusion that it was a school-house. Still mystery hung around it, and conjecture could not satisfactorily solve the problem of its use. At length the Judge, after he had completed the building, satisfied curiosity by declaring it to be for a Female Academy. He had of his own conception, and at his own expense, planned and erected a building which he proposed to dedicate to the education of females, and this was at a time when his own children, all daugh ters, had completed their education. The foundation and endow ment of a seminary was for the benefit of others, a beautiful tribute, one can but think, to the ripening virtues of his own daughters. On the 25th of December Judge Cony conveyed the academy and lot upon which it was situated to Samuel S. Wilde, Nathan Weston, Samuel Cony, Reuel Williams and Daniel Stone in trust, \"to occupy, manage and improve the same, for the use and sup port of a Female Academy.\" In a letter to these gentlemen, re questing them to accept the office of trustees to which he had appointed them, he said, \"The importance of female education has for a number of years been a subject of my most serious and anxious solicitude,\" and he felt confident that he had confided"], [455, "1815. Academy Incorporated. 423 the interest of the infant seminary to worthy hands, who would \"infuse into its government and instruction a catholic spirit \u2014 chaste, liberal and ennobling principles.\" He recommended \"instruction gratis to such number of orphans and other females, under sixteen years of age, as shall be certified by a committee \"of their board as worthy the bounty.\" The gentlemen addressed accepted the trust and organized January 5, 1816, by choosing Judge Wilde president, and Reuel Williams secretary. A com mittee was now chosen who employed Miss Hannah B. Aldrich as preceptress, and the school went into operation. On the first Wednesday of July, a day appointed for the annual examination and visitation by the trustees, Rev. Hezekiah Packard of Wiscas set delivered in the academy an address on the subject of female education. Judge Weston on the same day and occasion in the following year addressed the young ladies of the seminary. It was now thought advisable to have the institution incorpora ted, and upon application to the legislature the trustees, on the 10th day of February, 1818, were incorporated by the name of \"Cony Female Academy.\" They, with their successors, were made \"visitors, trustees and governors\" of the seminary. Upon their organization under the charter, the officers previously chosen were elected to the same offices. At a meeting of the trustees held July 22, 1818, Judge Cony addressed to them a communi cation enclosing certificates for ten shares of the Augusta Bank, which he asked them to accept on condition of applying five sixths of the income to \"aid and assist in the instruction of orphans,\" the remaining one-sixth to be expended in \"medals or books\" to be conferred on \"meritorious pupils.\" He also informed them that he placed at their disposal a bell for the academy building, and maps and charts for the instruction of pupils. Judge Wilde delivered the address at the annual visita tion in July, 1819, and resigned as trustee upon leaving the State in 1821. The academy had been so successful under the \"approved and experienced preceptress,\" Miss Aldrich, that it had become self sustaining, and in July, 1820, had a sum of money on hand in excess of expenses. As Miss Aldrich was now about being mar ried to Pitt Dillingham, a committee of the trustees was directed to procure a preceptress when she \"shall find it necessary to leave,\" and Miss Bancroft of Worcester, Mass., was employed"], [456, "State Endowment. 1815. 424 and taught in 1821, but was succeeded by Mrs. Pitt Dillingham in 1823. Miss S. A. Farnham taught in 1824, and was followed by Miss Harriet Green in 1825. In order that the usefulness of the institution might be increased, the legislature was now petitioned for a grant in aid of its funds. Objection was made to the grant on the ground that the institution was not subject to the control of the legislature, whereupon the corporation on the 21st of January, 1826, consented to such an alteration of their charter as should give the legislature the right \"to grant further powers, and limit or restrain any of the vested powers, as may be judged necessary to promote the best interests of the institution.\" On the twenty-second of the following Feb ruary the legislature granted, by resolve, a half township of land to the academy, which was sold in February, 1832, for six thou sand dollars. In the fall of 1826, a lot was purchased on the corner formed by Bangor and Myrtle streets, for a boarding house for academy students, and in the following season the present brick building was erected at an expense of some four or five thousand dollars. The same year Benjamin Bussey of Boston, gave a tract of land in Sidney to the Academy, which was afterwards sold for five hundred dollars. The institution in 1828, again came under the management of Mrs. Pitt Dillingham, who was assisted by her sister Miss Mary A. Aldrich, and so continued, in a prosperous condition, under their instruction for five consecutive years. Its real estate, personal securities and furniture amounted at this time to $9,785, and its library numbered twelve hundred volumes.1 Miss Susan Bowen was preceptress in 1833 and the two follow ing years. She was succeeded by Miss Farnham in 1838 and '39. Miss Townsend taught in 1840; and Mrs. Dillingham and Miss Aldrich resumed instruction in 1843; Miss Aldrich, Miss Irish and Mr. J. Edwards in 1844. The school had now become so large that the small academy building was insufficient for its accommodation, and the trustees, \" to give full effect to the benevolent intention of the founder and the grant of the State,\" voted, on the 16th of November, 1844, to provide \"improved accommodation,\" which was accomplished by the purchase of the Bethlehem church for $765, and the same was 1 Return to the State for 1829."], [457, "1816.

The feeling in favor of separating Maine from Massachusetts was increased by the events of the war just ended, and renewed efforts were made this year to effect it The General Court, by a resolve of February 10th, provided for ascertaining the sentiments of the people by meetings to be held May 20th, at which the yeas and nays given upon the question, together with the whole num ber of legal voters in the district, were to be returned to the Sec retary of State. Upon an examination of these returns it was found that 10,393 had voted for separation and 6,501 against it, and that the whole number of legal voters was 37,828. The vote of Augusta was strong for separation, two hundred and forty-five in favor to twenty-four against. The senators and representatives from Maine now petitioned the legislature for its consent to separation ; and a law was passed prescribing the terms and providing for taking the sense of the people on its \"expediency\" on the first Monday of September, and authorizing towns to send delegates to a convention to be held in Brunswick to frame a constitution if the convention should find that a majority of five to four of the votes returned were in favor of the measure. Augusta, at the September meeting, de termined separation to be expedient by a vote of two hundred and fifty-eight to thirty-nine, and elected John Davis and Nathan Weston, Jr., delegates to the Brunswick convention, which as sembled on the last Monday of September, and on canvassing the returns found 11,969 yeas to 10,347 nays, not the majority required by the act But a large majority of the convention being in favor of immediate separation, found the aggregate yeas in towns giving a majority in favor, compared with the aggregate nays in those giving a majority against, was a larger affirmative majority than five to four, and decided that the l-equisite majority was given, and on the strength of this dodge, which was called the \" Bruns wick arithmetic,\" the convention chose a committee to frame a constitution, and one to apply to Congress for admission into the"], [458, "1816. 426 Kennebec Bridge Falls. Union, and then adjourned to the third Tuesday of December ; but the General Court convened in the meantime, and not approv ing of their proceedings dissolved the convention. The town this year, at its annual meeting, chose a strong com mittee, consisting of James Bridge, John Davis, Lewis Hamlen, Nathan Weston, Jr., and Williams Emmons, \"to thoroughly in vestigate the affairs of the town and ascertain the cause of the greatly increased expenses, and report a full statement of facts, and devise some system of reform whereby the expenses of the town shall be brought within the ability of its inhabitants.\" The Kennebec bridge, which had now stood nearly twenty years without covering, had become so decayed as to be unsafe to cross with carriages. The eastern arch had settled on the south side, giving warning of its weakness, yet persons passed on foot till Sunday June 23d, when, as part of the congregation had assembled in the afternoon for public worship, some of whom had just crossed the bridge and as others were about stepping on, it suddenly fell with a loud crash, which brought many in the meeting-house to their feet, and some to the windows from which the bridge could be seen. It was soon ascertained that no casualty had attended the fall, and the excitement which arose quickly subsided. A ferry was now put in operation at the town landing and continued till the bridge was rebuilt two years after. The season of 1816 was the coldest and \"most disastrous on record.\" Frosts occurred in every month in the year. A snow storm prevailed April 12th, which made sleighing for a number of days, and May 24th rain froze on the fruit trees then nearly ready to blossom. Again, June 5th and 6th, the weather was wintry with squalls of wind from the northwest accompanied by snow and hail. The ground froze, corn and potatoes were cut down, and workmen put on their coats and mittens. This weather con tinued for some days. On the 8th of June Samuel Howard, sheriff of Kennebec, wrote to Henry W. Fuller, then at Boston as representative in the legis lature, that \"yesterday and to-day the weather has been so cold that a large fire has been kept up in court all day \u2014 great numbers of birds have been found dead in consequence of it, and others so benumbed that the boys caught them about the fields.

Spots on the sun were observed at this time which attracted universal attention ; and on the 19th of September, Gen. Sewall records \"a fast, on account of the extraordinary cold and dry season and the decay of religion, observed by neighboring ministers and churches ;\" and on the 7th of October he notes \" a small fall of snow last night.\" At the end of his diary for this year, he sums up as fol lows : \"The year past has been remarkable \u2014 the season of vegata tion was uncommonly dry and cold, not a single month without frost ! The crop of Indian corn almost entirely cut off, those of hay reduced one half, and of grain, particularly rye, very consider ably diminished. Remarkable events have also taken place in this county.

He made room for John Hovey of Mount Vernon, and the sheriff removed was Samuel Howard, who was succeeded by Chandler Robbins. The removal was made by Gov. Brooks, \"with the advice and consent of council,\" and was certified to Howard, before his successor was appointed, under the great seal of the State.' The season was remarkable for a severe drought accompanied, in the autumn, by the prevalence of extensive fires in the woods, which were attended, in some sections of the State and in the British Provinces, by loss of life and great destruction of prop erty. In this region so severe was the drought that water is said to have been carried three miles from the river to extinguish fires.* The atmosphere for weeks was thick with smoke from the burning woods, and became very dense on foggy mornings. On one occa sion as Reuel Williams and Judge Mellen, who usually stopped with Mr. Williams when in town, were crossing in the ferry-boat to attend a court the Judge was holding, the ferryman, unable to see scarcely a boat's length ahead, became completely befogged, and after a long pull landed them, without crossing, on the same side of the river from which they started.3 The spots on the sun were very remarkable.

During the months of April and May they were more numerous and of greater mag nitude. Some of them suddenly burst forth in clusters, and ap peared for a day or two and then as quickly disappeared. On the 29th of May there were six spots of magnificent proportion, vary ing by estimate from ten to fifteen thousand miles in diameter.1 The \" Ohio fever,\" as the infatuated spirit of emigration to the Western States was called, commenced in the previous year, in duced by the depressing influences of the war and the gloomy aspect of affairs at its conclusion, together with the captivating representation of the richness of western lands, the mildness of western climate, and the cheapness and abundance of food in the far off land. Many sold their possessions at small prices, stowed their families with .a few valuables into covered wagons, and started upon the long and tedious journey to the Ohio. As the cold and dry season of the present year advanced the emigration increased, notwithstanding the discouraging accounts of some who had returned disappointed, sick and poverty-stricken. The severity of the following winter and the backwardness of the succeeding spring tended to keep the tide at its full flood. It was ridiculed in the public prints, which published cuts rep resenting those \"going to the Ohio\" with good wagons, drawn by sleek and fat horses, driven by robust men surrounded by healthy and smiling families; while the carriages with \"I have been to the Ohio \" were rickety, with tattered coverings, attached to skeleton horses, drawing a haggard, distressed and ragged looking company. A favorable change in the season, giving lux uriant vegetation, promising an abundant harvest, and truthful stories of the distress of the emigrants, related by those who had returned, checked and finally ended the swelling tide. Augusta was this year a rallying point for the emigrants from the northern and eastern sections of the State. They started in companies after purchasing their supplies for the journey. Num bers of covered wagons remained for some days at a time in Mar ket square during their preparations, from which no little business arose. The exchange of their paper money for silver was also made here at a profitable premium.8 Maine is estimated to have lost from fifteen to twenty thousand inhabitants by this exodus.

The town came to the relief of those who had not the means of procuring it, by raising, at the May meeting, two hundred dollars \" to enable the selectmen to furnish seed to such persons as can not get it for themselves, upon their giving security that it shall be sowed or planted, and paid for after harvest.\" In May, by the prices cur rent in Boston, beaus were $4 to $4.50 per bushel, corn $1.80 to $1.85, rye $1.65 to $1.70, oats 65 to 70 cents, flour $14.50 to $15, yet so productive were the crops this year that, at Augusta in December, wheat was but $1.25, corn $1.00, and beans $1.25 to $1.50 per bushel. This year the town, probably from a regard to their previously expressed opinion in 1813 as well as from motives of economy, elected but one representative, Pitt Dillingham. But in the fol lowing year they elected two, and Gen. Sewall the town clerk in making a record of the meeting wrote with red ink to mark their inconsistency, that \"the said inhabitants having previously decided to elect two representatives\" did then and there elect \" Pitt Dilling ham and Robert Howard,\" underscoring the names with the same glowing color. The selectmen were authorized to purchase a hearse for the use of the town this year, which was probably the first hearse used here in burying the dead. The bier had been uniformly used for short distances, and sleighs and wagons in their season, for longer ones. The ferry boat, which plied at the town landing, was drawn across, when the river was not swollen, by means of a large rope attached to the shores. This passed through trucks, fastened to the railing of the boat, which kept it in place. As the boat was 1 Hallowell Gazette, Feb. 19. 1817."], [462, "1817. 430 Augusta Patriot. crossing from the western shore, on the 26th of September, with a number of foot passengers and a carriage with a span of horses driven by George Evans, who had with him two young ladies from Hallowell, the horses became restive and backed, throwing Marcia Paulina Cony, a young and beautiful daughter of Gen. Samuel Cony, into the water. She floated off buoyed up by her clothes but at length sunk and was drowned. Much indignation was felt at the time that no effective effort was made by the ferryman and others in the boat to save her, but this arose, probably, from their confined condition in the boat and want of presence of mind. Immediate but unsuccessful efforts were made from the shores to recover the body. It was not found until the tenth day of October following, and then at the mouth of Eastern river in Dresden. Proposals were issued December 12, 1816, by James Burton, Jr. for publishing the Augusta Patriot, in which he said, \"personal invective, political rancor, and sectarian heat, shall be rigidly ex cluded from its columns.\" Burton had been an apprentice of Peter Edes, and had started the Hallowell Gazette, a federal paper, in company with Ezekiel Goodale in January, 1814. The Ameri can Advocate, a democratic paper, had been at that time published in Hallowell, by Nathaniel Cheever, since January, 1810. The first number of the Patriot was issued March 7, 1817. Both the republican and federal nominations appeared conspicuously in it. It probably was not sufficiently partizan for the times, and died a year or two after from want of patronage. From advertisements in the Patriot it appears that the new firm of J. & G. Hamlen traded next door to the post office, and had a large amount and variety of goods for sale, as did also Johnson & Dillingham, who traded in the north tenement of the Robinson & Crosby store. John H. Hartwell, auctioneer, was to sell at auction \" an entire stock in trade,\" at the store formerly occupied by Whipple & Burton. In April, Offen B. Palmer in formed the public that he had opened that spacious house, lately occupied by Hon. Nathan Weston, Jr., opposite the court house, as a hotel. This was the Mansion House before its enlargement. Some complaint in a May number was made of the neglect of Maine by Massachusetts, and a call made to have the contemplated road to Quebec laid out and opened ; and in August, the commis sioners for the sale and settlement of the public lands gave notice"], [463, "1818. Kennebec Bridge Rebuilt. 431 of an intention to settle two townships, \"on the great thorough fare road from Kennebec to Quebec.\" 1 The first Millinery establishment was opened in town, this year, by Miss M. M. Cox, who kept a good assortment of fancy articles in a shop which was opposite the lot on which the Franklin house stood. Peleg Sprague, attorney at law, advertised his removal from Augusta to Plallowell, in the Advocate in March of this year.2 The great local event of this year was the rebuilding of the Kennebec bridge upon an improved model. The proprietors, on account of loss by the first bridge, were dilatory in rebuilding. The receipts from toll furnished so small encouragement for the purpose that the legislature authorized them to raise by lottery the sum of twelve thousand dollars, which, however, was not productive from the little encouragement given at the time to such enterprises. The lottery ha;d reached its second class in May 1819. This class it was advertised would be twenty days in drawing. The western arch of the old bridge was removed in March, by cutting most of the leading timbers at the abutment and pier ; small fires were then set under the remaining supports, which gradually became weakened, until the arch fell with a loud crash upon the ice. The new bridge, under contract to Benjamin Brown and Ephraim Ballard for about ten thousand dollars, was vigor ously pushed forward and completed late in August. It was the same in structure as the present bridge which replaced it upon its being burned in 1827. The toll-gatherers seem to have had some influence upon the receipts from the bridge. Nathaniel Thwing was first appointed, upon rebuilding, and continued two years, when he was succeeded by Theophilus Ladd, who continued one year, during which the first dividend of $1,140, since the rebuilding, was made. The receipts, of about $1,200 per year, not being satisfactory to the proprietors, the bridge was let for one year to Buffum & Jones for $1,800. The next year, Deacon Packard was appointed toll gatherer, and the receipts were but $1,520; this not meeting the reasonable expectation of the proprietors, William Branch was appointed, and held the place two years, accounting for the dimin ished sum of $1,000 a year.

He ac counted for $3,300 as the result of the first year's tending. The following year the bridge was burned and rebuilt, and Kincaid continued to tend to 1867, forty-one consecutive years. The first Sabbath School was established in town May 7th 1818. It was under the direction of a sabbath school society, organized with president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and twelve directors, who superintended two schools, one for males in the morning and another for females in the evening. They were not continued through the winter, probably on account of means not having been provided for warming the meeting-house. In the next year, it is recorded that they \" closed for the season,\" Octo ber 24.' A barn on Hinkley's plains was fitted up by \"a detachment of the Boston company of Comedians\" for a theater, which went into operation July 21. Tickets, box 75 cents, pit 50 cents, were sold by B. Davis, Augusta. Two or three creditable performances a week, for a number of weeks, were well patronized. A per formance August 26th, for the \"destitute poor of Hallowell,\" realized over expenses fifty-seven dollars and fifty cents, which sum was paid to the overseers of that town.2 The renewed agitation of the often tried question of separation was finally successful this year. This time the measure was initiated by its friends, at meetings held in Boston during the winter session of the legislature. They chose a committee of fifteen gentlemen from the several counties in Maine, whose address to the people brought the subject into prominent notice and discussion in the public prints. The federalists took ground in opposition to the movement for fear, as the democrats said, that they would be in a minority in the new State ; and the demo crats were accused by the federalists of \"an inordinate ambition to rise into power,\" as democratic politics, which were in a minor ity in Massachusetts, were in the ascendency in Maine.3 How ever, the views entertained of the expediency and policy of the measure were mainly influential in deciding it. At the May session of the legislature petitions were presented from numerous towns for separation ; and on the 19th of June an act passed for that purpose prescribing the terms, and \"became a 1 Sewall's Diary. - Hallowell Gazztte, August, li<19. 3 Williamson 2, p. 6,72."], [465, "1819.

This act required a vote of the people, which proved to be largely in favor of the measure. The vote of Augusta was two hundred and ninety-three yeas to forty-nine nays. The town, in September, chose Daniel Cony, Joshua Gage and James Bridge delegates to a convention to assemble in Portland on the second Monday of October to form a constitution for the State. The constitution prepared by this convention was sub mitted to the people and by them approved on the first Monday of December. The vote of Augusta for approval was eighty and a solitary one in opposition. Application was now made to Con gress, and the State of Maine, by the act of the third of March, 1820, was admitted to the Union \"from and after the 15th\" of that month. The winter of this year was as remarkably warm at the north, as that of 1817 had been cold. For a succession of weeks, prior to February 10th, the weather had been as mild as is \"usually ex perienced at the south,\" where, however, they happened to have this winter an unusual quantity of snow, it having fallen in dif ferent places from six to eighteen inches ; while upon the Kenne bec but little had fallen, and that had at this time wholly disap peared. The thermometer ranged from 5\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 above zero, and on the 9th of P'ebruary stood at 54\u00b0. ' Amos Stoddard was the first lawyer at the nook in Hallowell. He came in 1792, and remained six years in town, during which he was town agent for one year and representative the year the town was divided. He was in the army of the Revolution three or four years, and was commissioned Major in the United States Army in 1798 the year he removed from town. At one time he was in command of Upper Louisiana, and Fort Stoddard was named for him. In 1813 he was wounded at the battle of Fort Meigs, and soon after died at the age of fifty-four. Although a man of education and talents, he probably did not have much business as a lawyer in Hallowell. 1 Hallowell Gazette, Feb. 10, 1819. 28"], [466, "1819. 434 Nathaniel Perley. Nathaniel Perley. The first lawyer who settled permanently at the Hook, in Hallowell, was Nathaniel Perley, a native of Box ford, Mass. He was graduated at Dartmouth College in 1791, immediately after commenced the study of law, and came to Hal lowell in 1794. He was the only practitioner at the Hook, except ing- Amos Stoddard, until Samuel S. Wilde removed there from Waldoborough, in 1798, about the time Stoddard removed. Mr. Perley 's practice was at first extensive, but his free social habits, and the business outside of his profession in which he engaged and by which he ultimately became involved in pecuniary difficul ties, caused it to decline and finally to be wholly lost. He repre sented Hallowell in the General Court in 1804 and 1816. He pos sessed varied and vigorous powers of mind, sound common sense, quick perception, unusual colloquial powers and great wit. One who was well acquainted with him says, \"A marked characteristic of his mind was a sort of natural wit, or gift of repartee,\" which he used in a manner \"highly injurious to his influence,\" rarely say ing anything \"which could worthily be rescued from oblivion.\"1 A cotemporary at the bar says, \" He was distinguished for his wit and broad humor \u2014 for his jokes and cutting repartees.\"2 Many of these are recollected and repeated at the present day. The few that will bear repetition do not sustain his great reputa tion as a wit. It may be that the attendant circumstances, which are difficult to transmit, gave special pith and point at the time to his sayings, many of which do not exhibit a mind of refinement or a cultivated taste. On one occasion in court an associate justice, very moderate in his movements and not very profound, by his tardiness kept the court in waiting, and as he hurriedly took his seat remarked, \" I believe there is no member of the court less absent than myself.\" \"True,\" responded Perley, \"and none less present.\" In the trial of a case before Judge Weston of the Common Pleas an important witness had been long examined by Mr. Perley when the court adjourned for dinner. On resuming the case in the afternoon he requested that the same witness might take the staud, when Judge Weston remarked that he had been fully examined, adding, \" Brother Perley, what further do you expect to obtain from him?\" 1 Charles Dummer, Esq., in Willis' Courts and Lawyers.

Benjamin Whitwell was born in Boston, June 22, 1772; was graduated at Harvard College in 1790; studied law with John Sprague, a distinguished lawyer of Lancaster, Mass., whose daughter he married. He came to the Fort settlement in Hal lowell in 1796, the year before Augusta was incorporated, and was the third lawyer who established himself in the town. Mr. Whit well was a gentleman of cultivated mind, fertile imagination, \"poetical temperament,\" a ready writer in an easy flowing style of clearness and purity, and a graceful speaker. He was more distinguished for literal taste and talent than for legal acquire ments. He wrote for Edes' papers, both poetry and prose ; was the orator selected on anniversaries and other occasions of special interest; delivered the eulogy on Washington, in the old meeting house, on the observance of the 22d day of February, 1800, in commemoration of his death, which Gen. Sewall declared \"ex hibited in a masterly manner the moral, political and religious features of our departed Washington.\" He delivered poems on various occasions before literary societies, and was beguiled in the more agreeable walks of literature from cultivating and exercis ing the higher powers of reason, judgment, discrimination and analysis, so necessary to success in his profession. Eminent law yers have written good poetry, but as a relaxation from labors which taxed the stronger powers of mind. Mr. Whitwell, in 1804, associated with himself in professional business Henry W. Fuller, who had read law in his office. After wards John Potter was his partner, and he was succeeded by Williams Emmons. Mr. Whitwell was chosen a selectman of Augusta in 1800, and represented the town in the General Court in 1804. He was an agent for some of the Plymouth proprietors, and was accused in 1808 of pursuing a course tending to increase the troubles which then existed with the settlers. This doubtless arose from an indiscreet communication which he published anony mously in the Kennebec Gazette, in which he bore honorable 1 Judge Weston."], [468, "1819. 436 Benjamin Whitwell. testimony to the fair dealing of the proprietors with the excep tion of \"one or two persons,\" to whose \"avarice,\" and that of \"certain speculating agents,\" the troubles were attributed. After stating fairly the questions at issue, he noticed certain dishonorable practices on the part of the \"select proprietor\" and \"speculators with their disputed titles.\" In relation to the latter he said, \"Pretended bonds have been given\" to convey land, with only initial signatures ; the purchase money paid, deeds demanded and withheld. The settler seeks legal advice and is told he has no remedy, and that the initials \"signify no more than any other two letters, take the alphabet in its course. A. B. means no more than C.

And what, sir, do you call this conduct ? Answer \u2014 To common understandings the crime is swindling and the punishment the pillory.\" He then adds, \" Let due information be given of the several acts of oppression committed by proprietors and agents ; let them be authenticated by oath or otherwise, and then printed and pub lished, that the cruel, unfeeling oppressor may be exposed to the merited contempt of his fellow-citizens.\" The communication was signed A.

To it was ap pended a note, that \" the writer leaves his name with the printer, and tenders his services to collect aud arrange any authentic statement which may be forwarded for publication.\" This was regarded as \"disingenuous calumny,\" \"calculated to excite dis trust and animosities,\" \" and to encourage a spirit of Opposition to the laws.\" Daniel Cony, who was agent for James Bowdoin and others, remonstrated with him upon the publication, and on the 11th of October, 1809, Whitwell signed a paper acknowledging the au thorship and saying \" that the particulars which the Hon. Daniel Cony supposes were designed to designate and defame him\" have \" no foundation in truth.\" This was published in the Kennebec Gazette of December 2d, following.1 Mr. Whitwell built the double house on Green street next to the Vose lot, in 1805.

Situated in a flourishing county, on a navigable river, one of the main arteries of the commerce of the new State, Augusta became of increased importance by the separation of Maine from Massa chusetts. This importance was soon enhanced by its being recom mended for the seat of government of the State by commissioners appointed under authority from the legislature. In addition to this, a project of a dam across the river, by which an immense hydraulic power would be created to move the wheels of domestic industry, added no little consequence to the town, which was be lieved to be \u2014 in the words of an early citizen on a convivial occa sion \u2014 \" rich in future prospects.\" The enlargement of trade and better accommodations for pros ecuting it consequent upon an increase of population and more prosperous times ; the establishment of influential public news papers ; the erection of public buildings by the United States, the State, and the County; the addition of two churches of different denominations ; the building of private dwellings and stores ; the increased facilities for intercommunication by stages, as well as steamboats \u2014 the latter just introduced on the river; \u2014 mark this as a period of unusual interest and activity in the history of the town, and one of great advancement in its social and material interests.

It had for its object improvement in useful knowledge by means of a library of choicely selected books, magazines and public news papers. Its first anniversary was observed November 27th, by an address delivered by Daniel Williams on the object and utility of the society, and each succeeding year an address was delivered by some one of its members. October 11, 1825, its sixth anniversary was observed in \"Mr. Tappan's meeting-house,\" when Alfred Red ington sang lines written for the occasion \"with much taste,\" and Richard H.

In the same room and under the care of the same librarian was a social library owned in shares. An additional means of improve ment was a circulating library belonging to William Dewey ; but by far the largest library in town was that of the Cony Female Academy, which embraced a collection of valuable books, some of them old and rare, the gift, mainly, of the founder of the institu tion, and such as he had collected from his friends and the friends of education in Massachusetts.

In August of that year, Col. Fuller purchased of Joseph North, Jr. this large tract, with the exception of the lots upon which buildings stood, for the sum of twenty-four hun dred dollars. At this time the area from State street to the foot of \"Burnt Hill\" was a cultivated field. Beyond, to the end of the first mile from the river, was a pasture. Fuller, the year follow ing, commenced improving this valuable estate, and built a large house which he occupied many years. This was centrally in the front part of the field, and is the same now owned by Dr. H. M. Harlow, and which he purchased of the heirs of the late Church Williams.

Water street, in 1785, was laid out by the town from the south line of number ten, near and back of the Piper tavern, to the present Green street two rods wide, except through Capt. Weston's land at the foot of Court street, where it was but twenty feet, probably the width of the bridge across the gully at that point. In 1789, the Court of Sessions attempted a county road over the same ground, extending up and down the river crossing Bond's brook at Jones' mills. This was recorded four rods wide, but was not established and opened. The county subsequently, in laying the river road from the towns above, stopped at Kenne bec bridge, probably on account of the narrowness of the street below which was still but two rods, a widening of which would have involved the expense \u2014 which the county was not willing to incur \u2014 of removing the brick store at the corner of Winthrop and Water streets, built in 1811, and located to conform to the narrow street. It was now proposed to adopt an improvement much de sired, by widening the street from the bridge to Market square to three rods, and eventually to cut ofi' the store. This was done at the May meeting in this year, by commencing two feet from the south west corner of the Craig store, at the west end of the bridge, and running \"thence, south 27\u00b0 west, by the corner of William Branch's shop,1 fifty rods, to the southwest corner of the brick store formerly owned by Robinson and Crosby,\" thence, commencing three rods westerly, and running a parallel line to Bridge street, cutting the protruding store about nine feet from the eastern end, which, however, was to remain \"till removed \\>y decay ,>r otherwise.\" Below Market square the street remained unaltered until 1860, 1 This was a wooden building which was burned down Nov. 8, 1823, and Branch erected a brick building on the foundation, which was occupied by Eaton & Severance for a printing office in Jan., 1S25."], [475, "1822.

It cost five hun dred dollars, and was raised to its elevation May 24th, being in sured against accident during the process by Robert Howard for twenty dollars. It was given with the \"hope that it may long remain an accommodation to the members of the parish as well as the town of Augusta,\" ' and was used by the town and city for municipal purposes to the time of its destruction by fire in 1865. A number of persons in the South parish interested in the im provement of church music procured the services of Mr. Holland of New Bedford, Mass., a professor of music, who opened a school in January \"for improvement in psalmody,\" which he taught \"on a new system,\" and on the 3d of March the \"new singers\" under his instruction took seats with the choir in the meeting-house. The advent of Mr. Holland, who gave private lessons on the piano, seems to have been an important event, and led to the cultivation of musical talent and taste which demanded the purchase of the first organ in town. This organ was placed in the meeting-house September 4th of this year, at an expense of five hundred and fifty dollars raised by subscription. On the following Sunday Mrs. Ostinelli played the organ. She was a daughter of Mr. Hewett, the celebrated musical composer of Boston, and had just been married to Mr. Ostinelli of that city, and was then on her marriage tour. From this time the bass viol, which had been the only instrumental accompaniment in church music, was laid aside. On the 19th of September an oratorio of sacred music was per formed in the meeting-house, for the benefit and under the direc tion of Mr. Holland, and another at the same place on the twenty fifth of the same month.

He was born in Italy, where he early received a musical education, which was completed by a seven years' residence at the \" musical con servatory at Paris, under some of the first masters in the world.\" These were first class concerts, and the only ones of the kind 1 Mr. Williams' letter, Parish Records."], [476, "444 \"An Era of Good Feeling.\" 1823. given in Augusta until nearly thirty-seven years after, when Ostinelli's daughter, Madame Biscaccianti, equally celebrated for musical talent, highly cultivated by skilful training, sang in Meo nian Hall in June, 1859. Mr. Holland remained in Augusta until September 1, 1823, when he left for New Bedford, having excited an interest and left an influence in favor of cultivated music which it is believed has been felt to the present day. The political unanimity which prevailed at this time was as un exampled as it was gratifying. Albion K. Parris, who succeeded Gen. King as governor, was reflected this year almost unani mously. Augusta gave him two hundred and seventy-three votes, the largest she had ever polled, to six in opposition for Ezekiel Whitman ; and in the two succeeding years she gave him every vote, which, however, did not average quite half the number of this year. Reuel Williams had for the two past years been chosen representative, and was this and the following year re elected without a dissenting vote. Equal unanimity prevailed in relation to Joshua Gage for county treasurer. According to the record of votes he had \"two hundred and eighty, and none for any other person.\" A few scattering votes were thrown on the senatorial ticket, but Joseph Chandler at its head had the full number of two hundred and seventy-six. These were all republi cans, and there was practically but one party till after the demise of Gov. Lincoln and the rise of the national republicans in 1829. In 1824 there was no election of president by the electoral colleges. Gen. Jackson had ninety-nine votes, John Q. Adams eighty-four, W. H. Crawford forty-one, Henry Clay thirty-seven. The House of Representatives, from the three highest, elected John Quincy Adams. He received the votes of thirteen states, Gen. Jackson seven and William H. Crawford four. A virulent opposition sprung up in the country to Mr. Adams' administra tion and in the interest of Gen. Jackson for the next president. This extended to Maine in the canvass of 1828, when party lines' were drawn and became distinctly marked under the administra tion of President Jackson who succeeded Mr. Adams in 1829. At the annual meeting this year State street was extended from the crossing of Grove street to the Kennady brook, to pass in a \"circular direction \" around \" Judge Weston's hill,\" to accom modate the State Capitol, which commissioners appointed by the"], [477, "1823. Searle's View of Augusta. 445 State had recommended to be located on that elevation. At this time the land over which the road was to pass was broken by deep ravines. Four years was allowed for constructing and open ing the road, which was laid out seventy feet wide but afterwards contracted to sixty. The town of Hallowell up to this time had been favored by an unusual degree of prosperity. She was in advance of Augusta in population, valuation and business enterprise. Her merchants were largely engaged in selling goods, of which they had heavy stocks, which continued to fall upon their hands till in the follow ing year a mercantile crash came, under which the principal traders went down. Their bank soon failed,1 and one of their papers suspended.2 These were severe reverses from which the town never fully recovered, and although the ratio of increase in population to 1830 was large, after that period it was seriously diminished. Cyril Searle, a teacher of music, temporarily residing in town, had a happy faculty of delineating in pencil. He boarded with Theophilus Hamlen at the Kennebec tavern, and during his stay sketched a view of Augusta from the east side of the river, standing in the field near the northwest corner of Judge Williams' house on Myrtle street. The sketch, which was well known and thought to be very accurate at the time it was taken, was lost sight of until it was recently found with the papers of the late Edward Rowse, with some of the lines in a somewhat obliterated condition. These were retouched and the sketch engraved. It was made after the separation from Massachusetts, for it is lettered \"A view of Augusta, in the County of Kennebec, in the State of Maine,\" and before November 8, 1823, for William Branch's wooden building which was destroyed by fire at that time is on it. There is other evidence from the sketch which leads to the belief that it was made in 1823. It is admirable in its outlines and gen erally correct in its details. The high land on the right is Burnt hill crowned on the southern end by the Davis house. The high land on the left is know as the \"Betsey Howard\" hill. In the fore ground at the left is the fort house with a block house, and at the end of the bridge is a store in which Gen. Cony traded at an early day.

Cony; the others are not known. The bridge is the one built in 1818 and destroyed by fire in 1827. In crossing the bridge from the east side the toll-house on the west side is first passed on the right and the Craig store next, while opposite is the wooden store of William Branch already mentioned ; turning up street Judge Bridge's office is on the left with the Doe house on the right ; opposite on the left is Benjamin Gilbreth's stable with a small building attached; next is the \" old castle\" with a poplar tree by it ; further up is the Dewey house with its front yard and three poplar trees by it ; a little above and back of this is the barn, finished for a dwelling, which belonged to the widow Heath's house which was burned down March 17, 1821; to the right is the Wells' house now standing at the railroad crossing; again to the left, by the horse and carriage in the street, is the Hill house, on which there was a long sign having on it in large letters \"John Hill, Tailor from London.\" Starting at the west end of the bridge and passing down street, on the right is the Craig house, which is seen over the Craig store, with a barn in the rear ; next is the Thwing house, the roof of which is seen over the Branch store ; and over the Thwing house is seen the large three-story Edes house ; at the left of this is the Augusta Bank, a square building with large windows.

At the left of the Hamlen house is the Hamlen store, a large square building ; and over it the Colman house, two stories in front and one in the rear. Passing down from Judge North's on the right is a small building early occupied by Miss Soule, milliner ; next Moses Safford's shop ; beyond is the Whit- well brick block ; to the right of this resting against the Hamlen store is a hip-roofed building formerly belonging to Hamlen but"], [479, "1823.

The town, in view of the business wants of the place and in anticipation of the seat of government being established within its limits, was desirous of establishing a newspaper of which it had been for some years destitute. A meeting of the principal citizens was held in the spring of 1823, at which Judge Bridge, Reuel Williams and Robert C. Vose were appointed to engage \"the proper persons to undertake the enterprise.\" The business of this committee was chiefly confided to Mr. Vose, who met, in the ensu ing summer, in Boston, Russell Eaton then engaged in the office of the National Intelligencer at Washington. He induced him to visit Augusta with a view of engaging in the undertaking. Mr. Eaton was favorably impressed witli the location and the encourag ing prospects, and returned to Washington in the fall of that year and invited Luther Severance, then at work in the Intelligencer office, to join him in the enterprise. To this Severance acceded, and the copartnership of Eaton & Severance wa\u00ab formed for the purpose of publishing the Kennebec Journal. During the next year the excitement of a Presidential election was to occur and it was thought an unfavorable time to start a new paper, and its pub lication was postponed until the following year. In the mean time"], [481, "1825. Kennebec Journal. 449 proposals were issued and extensively circulated, and Mr. Sever ance arrived in town November 20, 1824, to prepare for the publi cation. Mr. Eaton remained behind some weeks for the printing press and materials, which arrived with him at Bath by water in December, when the river was closed by ice. Finding Mr. Potter of Wales, who was about to return from market with an unloaded team, he induced him to take them by way of his home in Wales to Augusta, where they arrived January 1st. The press was set up in the Branch brick store at the southeast corner of Bridge and Water streets, where the first number of the Journal was struck off January 8th, by Benjamin Davis, Esq., who was present and \"gave the pull and took the paper,\" which he has preserved as a memento of the event. As the subscription list at this time was small, numbering but four hundred and fifty, and slowly increased, it became necessary for the publishers to practice a strict economy. They performed all the labor of composition and press work with the assistance of only one apprentice. Severance, who furnished the editorials, was in the habit of putting a portion of them in type without writing. This was done to save time, \" thus uniting\" \u2014 as has been remarked \u2014 \" with ease and rapidity a mechanical and mental process, which gave early proof of that well digested and concise mode of thought, which subsequently distinguished him as a political writer of ready force and condensed power.\" 2 The salutatory address of the publishers spoke well for the future efforts of the editor. It was excellent in style and unex ceptionable in matter, taking an enlightened view of their duty to the public, and stating the attention which they should give to the prominent objects of interest to the prosperity of the new and growing State. Not a word on politics, which were then in a quiescent state, was uttered. It is believed that the course of the paper while under the direction of its original publishers was singularly in harmony with their liberal professions at the start. In October, 1833, the Journal was enlarged a column to the page and proportionally lengthened. This made it of the same size as The Age, a democratic paper started in 1831, and became neces sary from the growing demand for more space to treat of themes of public interest, in the discussion of which it was taking a lead- 1 James G. Blaine in Kennebec Journal, April 25, 1856. 29"], [482, "450 Kennebec Journal. \u2014 Cushnoc Island. 1825. ing part. In June of the same year Mr. Eaton retired from the establishment, leaving Mr. Severance the sole proprietor and man ager for several years, until, in the beginning of 1839, he sold half of the paper and establishment to John Dorr, who had been en gaged at Belfast in publishing the Waldo Patriot. This connec tion was a fortunate and profitable one to the partners, and con tinued until Mr. Severance was appointed commissioner to the Sandwich Islands in 1850, when the Journal passed into the hands of William H. Wheeler and William H. Simpson, and was edited by Mr. Wheeler. Wheeler sold his interest to his partner Simp son, and engaged with John S. Lynde in publishing a paper at Bangor. Simpson in turn sold the establishment and paper to James G. Blaine and Joseph Baker. After a short ownership Mr. Baker parted with his interest to John L. Stevens, and in 1857 Mr. Blaine was succeeded by John S. Sayward, and the paper was published by Stevens and Sayward, editors and proprietors, until 1868, when it was sold to Alden Sprague, who was publish ing a paper at Rockland, Capt. Charles E. Nash of the Hallowell Gazette, and Howard Owen, who had long served in the Journal office. These persons formed the firm of Sprague, Owen & Nash. This enterprising firm commenced the publication of the \"Daily Kenneoec Journal \" on the first day of January, 1870, with en couraging prospects of success. A daily paper had been started in Augusta a number of times before, but failed each time for want of sufficient encouragement. The Journal was printed in the \"Branch store,\" at the corner near the bridge, about two years ; then the office of publication was removed to a new building erected on Winthrop street, near the railroad crossing; there it remained until October, 1833 when it was removed to the Citizens Bank building, and in 1857 to North's block ; from thence, in 1862, it reached its present loca tion on Water street, opposite Court street. In the Kennebec river at Augusta, half a mile above the bridge, was a low, gravelly island, called \"Cushnoc Island.\" It was about one-fourth of a mile long and from one hundred to two hun dred feet broad. A few low bushes and wild grape vines skirted its shore, with here and there a patch of water grass over its sur face. It was near the eastern shore of the river, between which and the island the water was shallow. The upper end was just 1 Samuel Goodwin's deposition on North's plan of 1751."], [483, "1825. Cushnoc Island. \u2014 Old Coon. 451 out of water in summer, and so broad as to fill one-half of the river, and yet so flat that a light freshet would considerably widen the river at that point, and, indeed, the whole island was so low as to be deeply submerged and apparently no obstruction in an ordinary freshet. The western shore of the river by slightly curv- ing turned the water towards the island, and the island turned the water passing around its head towards the shore. The two currents met at about equally oblique angles with great force, sending the united currents along in a straight course, with a heavy swell at low water. The current, which continued rapid past the entire length of the island, was ob structed about three-fourths of the way down by a large rock, flat on the top, imbeded in the gravelly bottom of the river a short distance from the western shore. On the upper and inshore side of the rock the bed of the river came near to its top, while at the lower and outer side the water was deep, and in passing whirled and broke, foaming and eddying on the shore below. This was called \"Coon's Rock,\" or \"Old Coon,\" from the name of a person who is said to have been drowned in the whirl of its eddy. At high water in summer the rapids at the island became smooth. In freshets \" Old CUSHNOC ISLAND AND RAPIKS. Old Coon \" was always noisy, but at particular stages of the water, and in favorable con ditions of the atmosphere, he roared with a power of utterance altogether disproportioned to his size, making himself heard at a great distance. This locality gives significance to the Indian name Cushnoc, which has various interpretations from men learned in the Indian dialect. According to Rev. Dr. Ballard it means \" The Running down-place,\" of which it is aptly descriptive. According to Rev. E. Vetromile it means \"The place of overtaking.\" Dr. Ballard in giving an interpretation in a letter February 24. 1865, in answer to our inquiries, says, after considering the various orthographies of the word, \"As to the true mode I am inclined to think that Cusenock, (i. e. Coosenock in pronunciation) is the original ; though it would not vary from usage to aspirate the"], [484, "Meaning of Cushnoc. 1825. 452 first syllable with an h. Farther investigation, with the aid of Rale's Dictionary, and the the Kimzowe Awikhegan, leads me to think that the meaning is 'The Running-down Place;' as Koussi hada means to go down the current. In the formation of geographi cal and local names the Indians took parts of words, and combined the most forcible parts in the new one. Thus we have Koussi \u2014 the going-down \u2014 n \u2014 for euphony \u2014 ock \u2014 the common formation to denote locality, like ook, ac, auk, og, &c. The word would be Koussi-nock, pronounced Koos-i-nock. I have thought that the falls at Augusta might well bear this interpretation in contra distinction to the larger falls at Waterville ; and that instead of 'carrying by,' the Indians could run the falls here in their birch canoes \u2014 though perhaps not in the lowest stages of the water. This would be a sufficient distinction. The definition given by Vetromile is from the verb mussenok to catch, overtake.\" We have ventured to adopt and extend the latter definition and to suggest that it means The head of the tide. If Cushnoc is from mussenock, \"to catch or overtake,\" the inquiry naturally arises as to what the catching or overtaking refers ; we have no tradition of Indian hostility at this place that would explain it, and the locality is remarkably free from Indian remains, few if any having been found. Did any phenomenon, other than that mentioned by Dr. Ballard, exist, suggesting to the Indian mind a name for the locality ? We find none but the tidal wave of the river, which is thrown back at this point, overtaking or overcoming the rapid. The rapid current was overcome by the reflux water. Here the waters from above and below met, each alternately overtook or overcame the other. Would not this feature more forcibly strike the mind of the natives than shooting by a rapid or fall which existed only a part of the season and then only during a part of the day? Mussenock, to catch, overtake, may also mean in the Indian dialect to overcome, the words alike imply superior power, speed, skill or strength.1 1 Since writing the above we are strengthened in our definition by the deposi tion of Col. William Lithgow, taken June 6, 1767, before Jonathan Bowman and Thomas Rice, and published in the New England Historical and Geneo logical Register for January, 1870, in which he says : \"On the eastern side of Kennebeck is a point of land called Cusinock by the natives, who say they give it that name because the tide runs no higher up Kennebeck. On said point of land stands Fort Western.\" The meaning of other Indian names of places on the river are given in the deposition. Having called Dr. Ballard's attention"], [485, "1825. Meaning of Cushnoc. 453 Navigation past \"Old Coon\" was difficult and at times danger ous. \"Longboats,\" which used to ply on the river, had been sunk in attempting its passage and the merchandise which they contained lost or greatly damaged. An attempt was made about 1820 to remove it with oxen. An hundred yoke were provided, and mill chains procured and fastened around it, the water at the time being extremely low sO that its top, which was rarely seen, ap- to this, he replied, January 26, 1870, that he was \" very much inclined to adopt Lithgow's interpretation, which is the most natural, and which his good opportunity allowed him to learn from the best sources.\" He also made some interesting observations which we quote : \"In Rale I find kisekat, ' the tide is low.' I also find, in an old pen-map, (1688 \u2014 1097 supposed by Church) Quish nock. The kise of the first word and the Quish of the second are enough alike to present the tidal idea. I also innd oosi1 kat, the tide is ' going down.' These and other expressions, taking in the syllables oosi, seem enough to warrant the sense of tide in the syllables usi, in CusinockA Curious to know how the Rev. Eugene Vetromile changed Mussenock into Cushnoc, we wrote him, mak ing the inquiry and giving the tidal and other interpretations, and in reply, February 9, 1870, he says: \"It is difficult to find the correct spelling of the word,\" \u2014 CusIieoc \u2014 \" Quishnock appears to me more natural.\" \" Tf the inter pretation given appears satisfactory,\" he remarks, \" it is easy to explain the .change of K into C, as they arc convertible letters. A' seems to me more cor rect than C, because if Mussenock was the original word, it must have been K 'mussenock; the K meaning the land where the tide overtakes the rapid. The m must have been lost or left for off euphony's sake.\" He remark words mentioned in the letter \" designate descent, but to con\\ ej the idea of a point reached by the tide, an expression meaning ascent appears to me more appropriate, especially as the genius of the Indian language in expressing the course of water always refers to the ascent. Hence when a river enters into another the Indians say ' the river forks in two,' having reference to the ascent.\" He again wrote, after further investigation, \"that if the word Cusi nock is the real name of the place \" \" the original and correct word must be Kwesanweik, and it means peninsula, presq'islt, (literally) they who live in the peninsula. Still later, May S, 1870, Hon. 3. Hammond Trumbull of Hartford, Conn., a gentleman learned in the interpretation of Indian names, in answer to our inquiry says he had observed the various forms of the name Cushnoc, and the variety of interpretations proposed for it, and that he found what appeared to him \" the most trustworthy form of the name, and possibly a clew to its meaning, in the account of the mission of Father Druilletes to the Abnakis, in 1652 (in the Relation de la JVouv France, for that year.) The writer men tions his meeting with an Abnaki captain, who had erected two crosses over rhe graves of Ms children, and who went from time to time to pray before these crosses, \"in the sight of the English who were livmg at Koussinok, a place where these good people [the Christian Abnakis] have a burying ground,"], [486, "454 Meaning of Cushnoc. 1825. peared above water. The oxen were stretched up stream upon the somewhat curved shore ; the chains straightened, an hundred goad-sticks raised awaiting the word, which at length came, and with a shout and jargon of names and waving of sticks the pull was given throwing the hindmost oxen, as the chains were tightened, into the river. After much preparation it was tried again, when the mill chains snapped asunder ; efforts were continued until dark, and where on thai account they hold yearly two great assemblies, in the spring: and the fall.\" Of the interpretations we mentioned, he remarked, \u2022' only one seems to deserve consideration, namely, ' Peninsula,' or rather ' tm the pen insula.' The word which you write ' Kwesanweik.' is the Kouesanoueik of Rale's Dictionary, and means ' on- the point,' m'ona peninsula that runs to a point,' \" and that \" it is not likely to have been given to any place where there is not a well defined river point, not merely a headland.\" \" If we must look for another meaning,\" he remarks, \" the account given by- Father Druilletes perhaps gives as the clew. Koussinok was, in some sort, a sacred place to the Abanakis. They buried their dead there, and for that rea son, held two solemn assemblies at the place, yearly. Now the primary mean ing of Koussi \u2014 is ' to show reverence or respect to,' ' to pay honor to,' hence, to consecrate, or hold sacred. It is found in various Abnaki words denoting; rites of heathen worship, divination or jugglery ,- and it was employed by the\" missionaries and Christian Indians, in the sense, nearly, of ' consecrated ' or ' devoted.' Tims, Koussi-gann, was a kind of divination, by which the Indian jugglers gave predictions of future events. Koussi-tangan, was a fast, or abstinence from eertain kinds of food, as a means ot iiverting misfortune. Koussihan, 'There is a festival, or holiday, in honor ofy (some saint, or holy season.) Koussihout, ' on the day of the fgte/ ' on the holiday,' or ' the time of sol emn observance.' Koussin-ok (the n giving to the prefix the form of an adjective) would denote ' the place of the celebration, or solemn observance,' or simply ' the conse crated place;' and the name would be appropriate to a Christian bnrying ground, or to the place where heathen rites were performed in honor of the dead, and where the Indian Meteouren gave predictions after consulting the spirits.\" Mr. Trumbnll remarks that he thinks it probable that we have here the origin of \"Cushenoc,\" but that he \"had not given the subject sufficient ex amination to speak at all positively.\" A peninsula terminating in a sharp point at Augusta would bear the name Kouesanoueik, or Quesanwiek, \"as we may write it, observing the English sounds of the letters.\" As we have no peninsula or river point of note or prominence, nor Indian bui-ying-ground, we are at present compelled to adopt the interpretation which gives to Cushnoc what appears to be its probable meaning\u2014 The head of the tide."], [487, "1825. Dam Proposed. 455 without producing any effect upon the rock, which could have been speedily removed by the use of a few pounds of powder ap plied with the knowledge and skill of the present day. It was at Cushnoc island that Col. William Howard said, as early as 1785, that a dam might and probably would be built some day across the river.1 Many years after, probably about 1818, Ephraim Ballard, the mill-wright and bridge builder, expressed the opinion that he could at this place \"build a dam across the river for twenty-five thousand dollars that would stand.\" It was not, however, until 1825, when the subject of internal improve ment was agitated, and public attention was turned to improving the navigation of the Kennebec, that \"the project of making a dam\" at Augusta was publicly declared feasible. Then it was by Luther Severance in the Kennebec Journal of July 30th. A few days previously, Severance, in viewing the rapids in the river, had, without any previous knowledge that a dam had ever been sug gested, become \" strongly impressed with the importance of such a work and the ease with which it might be made,\" and in an article advocating the construction, proposed to build it of split granite, twenty or thirty feet long, laid lengthwise of the stream, \"with the up-stream ends deeply covered with stones and gravel, and the other ends raised to the necessary elevation\" to form the dam ; and that a lock, with one lift, be provided to let through boats and rafts. He ventured to predict that a dam would be built, and that the time was \"not very distant when both banks of the river, from the bridge to the island, would be crowded with mills and manufactories.\" The flattering project to which the attention of the citizens was thus publicly called, became a general topic of conversation, and opened to the imagination of some a new destiny for their favorite town of Augusta. A portion of the press did not favor ably regard the project. The Oxford Observer, printed at Paris. made itself merry over it, and the Gardiner Chronicle in copying the Observer's remarks exclaimed, \" a hit\u2014 a palpable hit !\" but Severance declared that he did not feel the hit to be very severe, and remarked, \"It has not ' let daylight through us,' and we trust there was no poison on the rapier that made so dexterous a touch.\" After again urging the importance of the work he closed by declar ing, \" Briefly, if the dam is not made it shall not be our fault. At 'Daniel Sewall, Esq., upon the narration of his father, Thomas Sewall."], [488, "Kennebec Mill Dam Association. 1825. 456 any rate we shall not be laughed out of the project.\" The Hallo well Gazette next became alarmed, and gravely asserted that the \"great accumulation of water would subtract so much from the quantity of water below the dam, and destroy the navigation to Augusta, and perhaps to other places below.\" A column of edito rial was thought necessary by Severance to dispose of this absurd idea. Yet the Gazette, in answer, maintained that although the water would flow into the pond as fast as it ran out \"it would not flow into the pond as fast after the dam was built as before.\" This, and other crude notions, gave birth to an editorial by Sever ance on hydraulics. In November, Henry W. Fuller and others published a petition to the legislature asking to be incorporated by the name of the \"Kennebec Mill Dam Association,\" for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Kennebec, with power to build and maintain a dam across the river at or near the head of the island. The Journal, in which the publication was made, in calling attention to it declared, \" The plan, on whatever side we view it, appears to grow in importance the more it is investigated,\" and the \"Nucleus,\" a debating society which held weekly meetings, an nounced as its question for discussion: \"Will the erection of a dam,\" as proposed, \"promote the prosperity of Augusta.\" Upon the assembling of the legislature Fuller presented his petition, but the time was unfavorable for its consideration, and near the close of the session it was referred to the next legislature, upon the files of which it never ceased to slumber. This action was probably owing to the influence of an overshadowing movement commenced on the river above. Timothy Boutelle and others of Waterville issued a circular, in viting the inhabitants on the Kennebec and others interested in improving its navigation, to assemble at Waterville December 28th, to \"consider the subject.\" At the appointed time numerous dele gates from the towns on the river appeared, and in view of the attention \"to the great and laudable object of internal improve ment\" by the general government, and the \"vital importance\" of removing the obstructions from the Kennebec, and that no doubt was entertained of the \"practicability of the object,\" it was Resolved, That the improvement of the navigation of the river \" is an object of the first magnitude,\" and \"that if the waters of the river can be connected, as is believed to be practicable, with the waters of"], [489, "1825. Survey of Kennebec. 457 the St. Lawrence, the northern States generally will participate in the advantages of the measure.\" A large committee was appointed to further the object of the meeting. The general government was called upon to assist, and the proceedings were forwarded to mem bers of Congress. Responsive to this call Col. Abert with a corps of United States engineers, in the summer of 1826, surveyed the Kennebec from Bath to Skowhegan. From Augusta to Skowhe gan they \"levelled the river, and collected the requisite data for locks, dams, and partial canals.\" A report of their doings made to Gen. Macomb, chief of engineers, was laid before Congress ; but the project fell through for want of government patronage, with other stupendous schemes of internal improvement which were knocking loudly at the door of the national treasury for assistance. The principal improvements recommended by Col. Abert below Augusta were the removal of rocks, placing of buoys, and driving a row of piles opposite the wharves in Hallowell in such a manner as to narrow and thereby deepen the channel. The sand and gravel bars it was thought difficult to remove, permanently, with out very considerable expense and danger of causing others by the removal. Between Augusta and Waterville, the removal of rocks from the channel, and the construction of a low dam at Six Miles Falls to turn the water into a narrow channel, on' the western shore, was recommended. The Colonel did not favorably regard \"a lock and dam navigation from the tidewater at Augusta to Ticonic Bay,\" on account of the width of the river; the violent freshets to which it is subject; and the unfitness of the bottom, in many places, for locks and dams. The fall at Coon's rapid in Augusta, in a distance of 1650 feet was found to be 2.42 feet; from this to Bacon's rips, five miles, 10.11 feet ; Bacon's rips 2.70 feet; for the next four miles 4.18 feet; the next two miles 4.69 feet; six miles falls in a distance of five-eighths of a mile 2.17 feet ; Carter's rapid 2.92 feet ; Petty's rips 3.68 feet. The whole fall from the foot of Ticonic falls to high tide at Augusta thirty-six feet and ten hundredths. The project of a bridge across the Kennebec at Gardiner, which the people of that place were urging, was discussed in the Augusta, Hallowell and Gardiner papers in the autumn of this year, and was followed by a petition to the legislature for a charter. But the feeling was too strong in favor of internal improvement to permit"], [490, "Arch Rotv. 1825. 458 the obstruction of so important a river as the Kennebec, and the petitioners had leave to withdraw by a large majority. The increase of business, which at this time had become very apparent, required increased accommodations, and Arch Row, the longest block of stores then on the river, was erected in the front yards of the Edes and Thwing houses, on the west side of Water street. The lot in front of the Edes house was on a level with the street, one hundred feet long by fifty feet deep This was purchased for four hundred dollars. The Thwing lot was of the same depth, and about half as long. The houses stood upon a terrace of four or five feet elevation in the rear. The store south of the arch in the block was built by Benjamin Brown and occupied by Watson F. Hallett & Co. The one next north of the arch was built by Eveleth & Hartwell, and was occupied by them. The next adjoining this was built by Daniel Williams and Benjamin Brown, and was occu pied by Eben Fuller, who uninterruptedly continued in it forty years, to 1865, when it was burned. The two above were erected by Thwing and Parker, hatters, and Benjamin Parker, saddler, and were improved by them. The arch was left for access to the Edes house, and over it was constructed the first hall in town separate from a public house. It was sixteen feet by forty, and was used for public discussions by the debating societies; for the Augusta Lyceum, and for awhile as a conference or vestry room by the South parish society. From a glance at the advertisements of this year, it appears that Daniel Pike and N. S. Waldron had formed a copartnership and taken store No. 3 Market square ; that Benjamin Davis had taken James Bridge, Jr. as partner in business, under the name of B. Davis & Co.; that William Lambard had taken the store vacated by Eveleth & Hartwell ; that Chandler & Nason traded on the bank of the river just below Oak street, in a new wooden store erected on the site of one burned the previous year; that Means and Brooks traded on the' south side of Market square, next to Charles Williams'; and Redington & Williams on the north side opposite them; that William Dewey kept a book and hardware store, and William M. Ladd a bookstore; that Eben Caldwell was at the east end of the bridge, and P. & B. Crommett, milliners, on the west side just above the bridge; that Willard Snell druggist had taken the store vacated by Eben Fuller. Debating societies became very general at this time as a means"], [491, "1826. Steam Navigation. 459 of improvement as well as social intercourse. There were a num ber in town, of which the \"Nucleus,\" and \"Franklin Debating Club\" were the chief. The Nucleus celebrated its first anniver sary\u2122 the court house, November 14th of this year, when Pitt Dillingham, its president, delivered au address upon the advan tages of such societies ; after which the members and others \" supped at Palmer's hotel \" James Hartwell Williams was sec retary of the society. The facilities for traveling began to multiply rapidly at this time. The steamboat Waterville, built at Bath, and designed to ascend the river to Waterville was running in 1825. In June of that year she took passengers to Portland, on the occasion of the visit of Lafayette to that place.1 It was only when the river was swol len that she could go to Waterville, and then her progress was tediously slow; but in returning, with the rapid current, she made commendable dispatch. An unusual visitant in the waters of the Kennebec readied Augusta May 26th. This was the sea going steamer Legislator, Capt. Porter, from Boston, by the way of Portland. A great number of people from the towns on the river below came on an excursion in her. She was \"a swift handsome boat\" of two hundred tons burthen, one hundred and fourteen feet long, with accommodations for one hundred passengers. The Legislator at tracted much attention in Maine, \" so large and fine a boat having never before visited our waters.\" In June following she was the principal boat in the line from Boston to the Kennebec river and Eastport. The Legislator performed one trip between Boston and Bath by way of Portland and back, and one between Boston and Portland in a week. The Patent left Bath, on the arrival of the Legislator, for Belfast, and the Maine left Belfast on the arrival of the Patent, for Eastport ; each performing one trip in a week between those places. The steamer Waterville, in connection with this line, plied on the Kennebec between Augusta and Bath, making three trips a week. The fare was seven dollars from Augusta to Boston ; the time advertised to make the trip thirty hours.2 In May of next year, Capt. Porter purchased the \"Experi ment,\" a small but neat and convenient boat, which was run daily between Augusta and Bath. In the month of May 1827, Smith L. Gale of Augusta started \u25a0- Ib.

Robinson of Hallowell commenced running a coach once in two hours between that town and Gardiner. The stages which left Augusta in 1827, were a daily line to Portland by way of Hallowell, Gardiner and Brunswick ; a 'thrice weekly to Portland by way of Winthrop and Monmouth ; a daily to Bangor, through Vassalborough and China ; a daily to Belfast, through Palermo alternating by two routes ; a thrice weekly to Waterville ; a semi weekly to Farmington ; and a new accommodation line to Port land, which had just been established. Rufus Chandler Vose formed with James Bridge, Jr., the co partnership of Vose & Bridge, and erected a wooden store next south of the Augusta Bank. They kept groceries and dry goods, which were sold at wholesale. Frederic Wingate erected this year the brick store, on the Ezekiel Page lot on Water street, long occupied by his son, Charles F. Wingate, and in 1828 removed the Page house to its location north of the railroad bridge, and erected on its site the store and house owned by William Wendenburg. These were consumed when the Kennebec House was burned. The fiftieth anniversary of American Independence was observed this year with great festivity. Pitt Dillingham, Joseph Chandler, R. C. Vose and Daniel Williams were a committee of arrange ments. At dawn of day the discharge of cannon and ringing of bells announced the jubilee. Early in the forenoon the Light In fantry, under Capt. Daniel Williams, repaired to the residence of Col. Joseph Chandler who addressed them and presented the company with a stand of colors, on receiving which Ensign Theo dore S. Brown made an appropriate reply. The company then proceeded to Palmer's hotel, where a procession was formed of citizens and others, which they escorted under direction of Col. Chandler, marshal for the day, to the Old South meeting-house, which was decorated with festoons and wreaths of evergreens and flowers. Here the services commenced by two young ladies singing lines composed for the occasion. The Rev. Benjamin Tappan offered prayer, and Williams Emmons delivered an oration of \"uncommon excellence,\" which was followed by a poem by Richard H. Vose, who was said to be \" a young gentleman of great promise,\" and his poem was \" spoken of in terms of high approbation.\""], [493, "1826. Great Freshet. 461 At the conclusion of the services the procession reformed and returned to Palmer's, where dinner prepared by him was served in the court house. Hon. Daniel Cony, aged and vener able, presided at the table with dignity and spirit. \"His pleasantry frequently 'set the table in a roar.'\" He was assisted by Judge Weston and Col. Fuller as vice presidents. Pitt Dillingham acted as toast master. Gen. Chandler and Peleg Sprague, senator and representative in Congress, and some officers of the army and navy who were engaged in the survey of the Kennebec, were present. Amid the festivities the president re marked, \"that there was present a venerable gentleman, who was with him at the battle of Saratoga, and in Gen. Schuyler's army.\" He called upon him for a sentiment, whereupon the Hon. Nathan Weston, father of Judge Weston, then nearly ninety years of age, arose, and after briefly reviewing the events which preceded and led to the war of the Revolution, noticing the severity of the struggle and the spirit which brought triumphant success, gave the following toast : \" The spirit of '76\u2014 alive and unspent after fifty years.\" The Hon. Daniel Cony, president of the day, made a parting speech and retired early, leaving the direction of the more protracted sitting to younger men. In the evening fire works ascended from both sides of the river, and the day ended without accident to mar the festivities. In the night preceding Tuesday, March 21st, there was \"con siderable thunder and rain,\" and in the evening of Friday the 25th, the wind commenced blowing a gale from the southeast, accom panied by torrents of rain which continued till the following morning. The ice in the river was nearly two feet thick, and as the water rose it broke up early on Saturday morning, went down the river and jammed in an immense mass against Brown's island in Hallowell, so obstructing the current that the water rose on Sunday morning nearly twenty feet above common high water mark. This was higher than it had been known for \"upwards of forty years.\" In 1794 a jam of ice formed at Agry's point, in Pittston, and the water then rose at Augusta to within fifteen inches of the highest point reached in this freshet. And again, February 5, 1795, a jam formed between Augusta and Sheppard's wharf, when the water rose to about the same height as in the previous year. But in both these freshets the reflux flood was transient. In this freshet the river generally was largely swollen. At Waterville the west"], [494, "462 Great Freshet. 1826. end of Ticonic bridge was swept away, and a part of the Norridge wock bridge met with a like fate. The mass of ice at Brown's island became so compact at twelve o'clock Sunday, that the water fell two or three feet at Gardiner. The main street in Hal lowell was overflowed, cellars filled with water, and even buildings were flooded to near the second story. Capt. Wyman's sloop was driven into Mr. Elias Bond's garden, and a number of vessels were carried down and imbeded in the accumulated ice at Brown's island. A great amount of goods stored in the cellars at Hallo well were lost or damaged. The flood continued unabated till four o'clock in the afternoon, when it attained the highest point to which it reached and began to recede. The pent up waters thenburst their barrier at the island, and swept by Gardiner with irresistable force, bearing along ice, trees, logs, lumber and five schooners \u2014 a compact mass, moving with majestic power. At Gardiner a large building filled with ice stood upon Gardiner's wharf, with a slip by which it had been filled, standing up stream. The moving mass met and mounted the slip, piling upon and against the building, rendering it more firm by the superincumbent weight, and formed a barrier which averted a threatened danger from vessels in the dock below. A small vessel, however, above the wharf, was caught by the moving ice and crushed in an instant. The ice stopped a mile or two below Gardiner, causing the water to rise rapidly toan unprecedented height at that place. The damage in Augusta by this freshet was comparatively trifling. On Bond's brook, Judge Bridge's mills were damaged, and on the river a number of cellars of stores and houses were filled with water, and lumber was swept away. A severe northeast storm and freshets on the streams emptying into the Kennebec occurred April 18, 1827, by which dams, bridges and mills were swept away. In Augusta, Dr. Ellis's dam and the fulling mill connected with it, on the east side of the river, were destroyed ; Judge Bridge's dam and mill on Bond's brook were considerably damaged ; and Mr. Ladd's dam on the same stream was carried away. A religious society of the Unitarian denomination was organized in April, 1825, and worshipped during the ensuing summer in the court house and female academy. The services were led by cler gymen temporarily engaged. In September following, Daniel Cony, Joshua Gage,*'Samuel Cony, Edward Williams, Samuel R."], [495, "1827. Bethlehem Church. \u2014 Christ's Church. 463 Nason, Joel R. Ellis, Reuel Williams, and forty-six others, pub lished a petition to the legislature to divide the South parish, and incorporate that part of it east of the river into a parish by the name of the \" East Parish in Augusta.\" By so doing they said, \"There is reason to hope that harmony, good will and christian concord will be promoted and perpetuated in this place.\" The prayer of their petition was granted, and an act passed incorpo rating the East parish January 23, 1826. Measures were then taken to erect a church on the corner of Cony and Stone streets, by the sale of pews, which were so far successful that the frame of the building was raised May 25, 1827, and the edifice was completed and dedicated the 18th of October following by the name of Bethlehem Church. On this occasion the introductory prayer and reading of the Scriptures were by the Rev. Dr. Packard of Wiscasset ; the dedicatory prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. Nichols of Portland ; l the sermon was preached by Rev. Mr. Lamson of Dedham, Mass. ; and the concluding prayer was made by the Rev. Mr. Brimblecom of Norridgewock. A hymn composed for the occasion by Pitt Dillingham of Augusta was sung to the tune of Old Hundred. An organ was provided for the church ; and it was warmed by a furnace constructed of a potash kettle inverted on a fire box of brick, which was thought at the time to be a superior and improved mode of warming large buildings. During the year 1828 Rev. William Ford, a Scotchman of pre possessing appearance, came, upon the recommendation of the Rev. Dr. Abbott of Beverly, Mass., to preach in the parish. His pleasing manners and acceptable sermons procured for him an invitation to settle, which was accepted, and he was installed pastor on the 9th of September, 1829, on which occasion Rev. Orville Dewey of New Bedford preached the sermon. Previous to the installation, on the 29th of March of the same year, a committee of the parish, consisting of Rev. William Ford, Daniel Cony, George Crosby, Pitt Dillingham, John Brooks, Nathaniel Robinson and Cyrus Briggs was chosen, to consider the subject of forming a church. This committee subsequently recommended to the members of the parish, who felt disposed to unite and form a church to be known as \"The Christian 'It is noticeable that Dr. Packard and Dr. Nichols assisted at the ordination of Mr. Tappan in 1811."], [496, "Covenant. \u2014 Rev. William Ford. 1827. 464 Church of the East Parish in Augusta,\" the following Covenant: \" We profess our belief in the one living and true God. Our faith in His Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. We receive and regard the Holy Scriptures as the rule of faith and guide of life, humbly relying on the mercy of God, which we devoutly implore, for the pardon of sin and for assistance in duty, that we may be guided into the right understanding of the Oracles of Truth, that we may be enabled to observe the Ordinances of the Gospel of Christ, and live together in peace, love and charity.\" This Covenant was accepted and signed by eight men and five women ; and the church soon after received a large accession to its numbers. Mr Ford was educated in Edinburgh, Scotland, from which country he emigrated in 1813. He resided seven or eight years in Newbury and Newburyport, and had passed a winter in Georgia. Not long after his installation \" there began to be some mistrust with regard to his theological tenets.\" His sermons \"had evi dently been prepared\" for a different class of hearers than those to whom they were delivered, and upon inquiry it was found that while at the south he was connected, as pastor, with a Calvinistic church. This with \" other causes of dissatisfaction,\" resulted in his dismission in 1831. He, however, \"for a long time after\" claimed to be pastor of the church, and would not acknowledge the right to depose him. The church was now feeble, and found it difficult to raise the funds necessary to supply the pulpit constantly. But the American Unitarian Association came \"generously\" to its aid, and the Rev. Allen Putnam of Danvers, Mass., accepted a call to settle, and was ordained pastor Novem ber 23, 1831. As most of the parishioners lived on the west side of the river, a difficulty began now to be felt in the remoteness of the place of worship. Mr. Putnam thought it of great importance that the house of worship should be in the midst of his people, and the congregation concurring in his views a lot was purchased on State street, at the head of Oak street, where the present church edifice was erected and dedicated October 17, 1833. In January of the next year, Mr. Putnam met with a severe affliction in the death of his wife, and his own health failing, he asked and received a dis mission in June following.

Edes was invited to and ac cepted the pastorate of the church. A day was appointed for his installation. The ministers invited and expected to officiate on the occasion were to arrive by the steamboat from Boston ; but a storm prevented her leaving in season for the services, which were in consequence deferred and never performed. Mr. Edes, who was warmly 'nterested in the parish, was a modest, unassuming, and \" truly pious and worthy christian minister.\" He was of an inde pendent spirit which prompted him to exercise his right of suffrage. This gave offence to some of his people, who thought he inden tified himself with party politics at a time of heated party excite ment. \" Finding the general harmony disturbed,\" he asked a dis mission in 1839 and it was granted. The parish was now, for nine months, without a resident teacher, the pulpit being occasionally supplied by clergymen, one of whom was the Rev. Sylvester Judd of Northampton, Mass., then a recent graduate of the Divinity School at Cambridge, and a candidate for settlement. A unanimous call was given him to settle, which he accepted, and was ordained October 1, 1840. The sermon on the occasion was preached by the Rev. Dr. Peabody of Portsmouth, N. H. Mr. Judd soon infused new life and vigor into the parish. He was young and ardent, faithful and true in enforcing honest conceptions of religious truth. He was beloved \"for his artless simplicity, and the transparency and singleness of his heart and purpose.\" ' He was a laborious student, and possessed origin ality, fullness and depth of thought; was enamored of the true and beautiful, and aimed at a high standard of elevation and purity. His \"Church principles\" are embodied in a declaration which he drew up for the \"consideration of all the members of his congre gation, and the acceptance and signature of all who should approve it;\" it is as follows: Christ Church, Augusta, Me. Being no longer strangers, but heirs of the covenant confirmed before of God to the Fathers : We, the undersigned, Pastor and People, Parents and Children, constituting Christ Church, Augusta, of the Unitarian Church of Maine, of the church universal, express the following: We recognize the Church, coordinate with the Family and the State, as a divine and permanent form of human society.

We would live agreeably to the laws of God, and die in the hope of a glorious immor tality. This Declaration, after discussion at social meetings held at private houses, was approved by nearly a unanimous vote, but before it was signed Mr. Judd had passed away. He had engaged to deliver a discourse in Boston upon \"his views of the Christian Church,\" and on Monday evening, January 3, 1853, after severe mental labor in condensing a series of lectures which he had de livered to his own people on the subject into one lecture for the occasion, he repaired to the Stanley House to lodge, in order to take the early train of cars, which then started some hours before day, for Boston. During the night he was attacked by a fatal disease which in three weeks ended his existence.1 This sudden bereavement of the church of a pastor in the flower of his usefulness and the vigor of his manhood, awakened a pro found emotion of sorrow. Funeral services were performed in the church, which was draped in mourning, by the Rev. Robert C. Waterston of Boston, an early friend of the late pastor. Mr. Waterston afterwards supplied the pulpit for some months, and received au invitation to settle, but controlling circumstances prevented his accepting the call. The Sunday succeeding the burial of their late pastor the \" De claration \" was brought to the church, and was signed from Sabbath to Sabbath, until the members of nearly every family worship ing in Christ Church had subscribed to it. Rev. Loammi G. Ware of Boston was Mr. Judd's successor. He was installed pastor July 26, 1854; resigned July, 1857, and went to Burlington, Vt., where he now resides. Rev. George W. 1 J. H.

On Monday, the second day of April, at a few minutes past eleven o'clock in the evening, the town was aroused by the appall ing cry of fire, which had broken out on Kennebec bridge, and soon wrapped that structure in one dazzling sheet of flame. When first discovered the fire was bursting through the roof on the north side near the center, and apparently over the top of a closet used for tools. So rapid was its progress that Kincaid, the toll gatherer, narrowly escaped with his family, nis wife, with a child in her arms, fell at the door of the toll-house overcome by the smoke and flame, and was seriously burned before she could be rescued. The spectacle of the burning bridge was \"awfully grand.\" During the combustion of the light and inflammable covering the flames were fanned into the wildest fury, and with a \"tremendous roaring,\" in a dense and waving mass high above the water, spanned the river from shore to shore, capped by rolling clouds of black smoke which ascended far into the heavens. As the flames and smoke were in a great measure dissipated by the rapid and com plete combustion of the covering, a magnificent spectacle appeared of a bridge with a frame-work of fire. The glowing arches, posts, beams and braces were curtained by thin flames, which feathered and skirted them, through which, however, they could be distinctly seen in strong contrast by lines of \"redder light.\" This \"fiery skeleton of the bridge\" did not last long. Within half an hour from the time the alarm was given the eastern arch fell, and the western soon followed. Both continued burning as they floated down the river illuminating the shores.

At the first alarm, the citizens rushed to the scene of conflagration with fire engine and buckets, but were pow erless to extinguish it, as \"the fire poured from both ends of the bridge as it were from the chimney of a furnace, forbidding- all ap proach.\" Fire soon communicated, on the west side, to the \" Craig store\" on the north side of the bridge, occupied by E. & E. Jones, which was soon enveloped in flames, so that only a part of the light goods of all it contained could be removed. The brick store of William Branch on the south side, was repeatedly on fire. The glass melted in the windows, and it was only saved by great ex ertions. Still more distant, the old building on the west side of Water street, formerly occupied by the late Judge Bridge as an office, was repeatedly on fire, and the shop of Misses P. &. B. Crommett, north of the Craig store, was preserved by means of wet blankets, and a vigorous application of water from the engine. On the eastern side of the river the stores of Eben Caldwell and R. W. Lawson were in imminent danger, but were saved by the few persons on that side, some of whom were ladies who worked with great coolness and energy in passing buckets of water up the steep bank from the river. The people of Hallowell came as speedily as possible, with two engines, one of them a \"new hydraulion, with suction hose,\" to assist, but owing to the bad state of the roads they did not arrive until the greatest danger to the buildings saved had passed. It was believed at the time, that the fire was the work of an incendiary, who was seen lurking around the bridge by a person who crossed twenty or thirty minutes before the alarm was given. But the suspected person was permitted to go, while the opinion was suffered to prevail that the fire was accidental, probably from a lighted cigar thrown upon the flooring. The loss by this fire was about sixteen thousand dollars, with no insurance except upon a few shares of the bridge held in Boston.1 Immediate measures were taken to rebuild the bridge. Under the superintendence of Ephraim Ballard the work was pushed for ward with unexampled dispatch for this region.

The bridge, erected at this time, continues to the present day an en during monument of faithful workmanship. Seat of Government. At the organization of the State govern ment it was expected that the legislature would convene at Port land for some five or ten years, and in the meantime a seat of government would be fixed upon and suitable buildings erected. Under this expectation, individuals in Portland had prepared for the assembling of the legislature at that place. A committee of both houses, which was appointed near the close of the session in 1821, to designate a place for the meeting of the next legisla ture, reported, by Samuel Small their chairman, after \"due inves tigation,\" recommending the town of Hallowell. This place the committee regarded nearer the center of population \"than any other considerable town in the State.\" They said it appeared from the pay roll of the House, at the pre vious session, that the aggregate travel of the members to Port land was 11,135 miles, and from \"accurate calculations,\" it had been ascertained, that the travel of the same members to Hallo. well would be but 7,985 miles. \"The travel of the members of the senate and executive council was found to be in about the same relative proportion in favor of Hallowell. Other economical con siderations, in the general and incidental expenses of government, were presented and found to be equally favorable to Hallowell. To these was added the \" satisfactory assurance \" that \"suitable accommodations for the various departments of government, not inferior to those enjoyed at Portland, would be provided in Hal lowell, free of expense to the State.\" From these considerations the committee was \"constrained tp believe\" that the public good required the legislature to hold its next session in Hallowell ; for which purpose a resolve was submitted, which, however, failed to pass either House.1 This was the commencement of the agitation of the question of the seat of government in the legislature. The subject again came before the legislature in 1822, where an able 1 Printed report in Hallowell Gazette, April 4, 1821."], [502, "1827. 470 Report of Committee. i and intelligent committee, consisting of Daniel Rose of Thomaston, Benjamin Green of South Berwick, and John Chandler of Mon mouth, was appointed by the governor and council, under a resolve of the legislature of February 8th, which was \" authorized and directed to visit such towns as they may deem proper, and designate some central and suitable place at which the seat of government may be permanently fixed and established ; to ascer tain the terms upon which a convenient lot for the accommodation of the State can be obtained, and the time when it will be proper for the legislature to meet at the place thus to be designated.\" This committee was directed to report to the next legislature at its meeting in Portland.1 The committee, in the course of their examination in the summer following their appointment, came to Augusta and inspected a num ber of sites, among which was \"Weston's hill,\" upon -which the eapitol now stands. It was then a conical elevation, higher than at present, east of the then traveled road to Hallowell, and sep arated from the village of Augusta by a deep ravine across which State street now passes. This was a beautiful spot, of commanding prospect, pleasing to the eye, and every way suitable for the erec tion of public buildings. The committee in making their report say, in order \"that they might be enabled more correctly to de termine upon the place which in their opinion would be most cen tral and suitable for a permanent establishment of the seat of government,\" they visited Portland, Brunswick, Hallowell, Au gusta, Waterville, Belfast and Wiscasset, in each of which towns \" a choice of very valuable lots was freely offered to the accept ance of the State,\" all of which were \"capable of affording not only convenient, but eligible sites for the erection of all necessary public buildings.\" They did not deem it necessary or expedient to ' ' report in detail all the arguments suggested by situation and circumstances \" which were urged upon them in favor of either of the places named, but \"endeavored to give every considera tion its due weight.\" They were satisfied, however, should it be thought expedient to establish the seat of government on the sea board, that \"Wiscasset is entitled to a decided preference, on account of its more central situation, the facility with which it might be defended in case of invasion, and the safe and easy access to it by water.\" Should it be thought expedient to locate 'Vol. 1. Resolves, p. 161."], [503, "1827. Legislative Action. 471 in the interior, the committee were \" unanimously of opinion \" that the site in Augusta, delineated on an accompanying plan, which was the Weston hill site, \"is the most central and suit able,\" and they decided \" that the town of Augusta be the place at which the seat of government may be permanently fixed and established, and that it will be proper for the legislature to meet at that place on the first Wednesday of January, 1827.\" ' This report was amended, recommending the legislature to meet at Augusta in 1830, provided the citizens of that town should convey to the State, free of expense, a site for the public build ings, and as thus amended was adopted. Individuals in Augusta, in complying with the condition im posed by the legislature, and conforming to their previous offer, purchased of Judge Weston, for a large sum, the lot of land designated by the legislative committee, and conveyed the same to the State in December, 1823. The deed conveying this lot, executed by Joshua Gage and others, was communicated by the governor to the legislature January 15, 1824, and was referred to a committee, which reported a resolve providing for the accept ance of the deed. The report was accepted in the Senate and the resolve passed.2 In the House the further consideration of the resolve was postponed until 1827, by a vote of seventy-seven to sixty-five ;' .but this was subsequently reconsidered and the sub ject referred to the next legislature by a vote of seventy to sixty six.4 In this the Senate concurred. The subject, by reference, came before the legislature of 1825, with deeds of lots conveyed to the State by citizens of Thomas ton and Wiscasset, which with the Augusta deed were referred to a committee, who reported again recommending the acceptance of the Augusta deed. Thereupon a debate arose, principally on the \" form and language of the deed,\" when, to obviate objec tions, another deed was obtained from the same parties in Au gusta, and its acceptance recommended by a committee to which it was .referred. Upon motion of Mr. Adams of Portland, to postpone the fur ther consideration of the subject to a day beyond thfe probable limit of the session, a debate arose, which was conducted prin cipally between Reuel Williams of Augusta and Samuel Fessenden 1 Report of committee to legislature, Jan. 17, 1823. 4Ib. p. 122. s Jan. 21, 1824. 3 House Journal, p. 72."], [504, "472 Legislative Action. 1827. of Portland. The former urged a decision of the question of loca tion, in order that preparation for building might be economically made, and during his remarks he considered the question of the place of location. The latter advocated delay, as it was not con templated to locate at Augusta before 1830, and before that time arrived it might appear that Augusta was not the proper place for the permanent location. The postponement, which was carried sixty-five to fifty-four, was subsequently reconsidered, and the subject was referred in both branches to the next legislature. In 1826 no progress was made. The subject came up on the report of a committee designating a place for the meeting of the next legislature, which was finally determined to be Portland. This brings us to the year 1827. In the Senate, January 24th of this year, resolves were passed \"fixing the seat of govern ment at Augusta from and after January 1, 1830,\" and providing until that time for the meeting of the legislature at Portland, also accepting the deed of Joshua Gage and others of a site for the public buildings, and authorizing the governor and council to procure plans and estimate of the expense of suitable buildings. The resolves were referred in the House to a committee which reported them without amendment, and upon a day assigned for their consideration Mr. Adams of Portland proposed to amend, by striking out the resolves and substituting one providing simply for the meeting of the next legislature at Portland. He was not prepared to say that Augusta was the most suitable place for the permanent seat of government, and he did not think it expedient to legislate further on the subject than his amendment proposed. Mr. Davis of Augusta regretted to see the resolves assailed in this manner, and if the gentleman was sincere in his declared pur pose of only providing for the next legislature, his amendment was useless, as the original resolves provided for that. Mr. Evans of Gardiner was surprised to find the resolves thus attacked. Nobody supposed the next legislature was to be carried away from Portland. The object of the resolves was to fix a time for removal, \"and to designate a place where the seat of government should be permanently fixed.\" Mr. Goodenow of Alfred hoped they should all endeavor to as certain their duty and \"have the firmness to do it.\" He presumed his constituents were in favor of Portland for the seat of govern ment. If it would be just to other parts of the State they would"], [505, "1827. Legislative Action. 473 be glad to have it fixed there; but they had more regard for justice than for their own private interest. He believed justice to the State at large required the passage of the resolves. Mr. McCobb of Phipsburg hoped the amendment would not prevail ; it was time the question was settled ; it ought to be put at rest; he was not particular about the place. Mr. Adams frankly avowed that he did not want to come to the consideration of the question of the permanent seat of government at this time. The treasury was empty ; there was no present means for building ; the boundary of the State was not settled, and we could not tell where the center would fall. Mr. Ames of Bath considered two questions, when to remove and where to establish. The objection that the condition of the State and the center of our population are constantly changing would always remain in force, and if admitted we never should fix our seat government. He believed it was time to fix upon a per manent seat of government. He felt more embarrassed as to the place where, for gentlemen were manifestly influenced by self interest more than by the broad principles of justice. Brunswick, Bath, or Wiscasset might accommodate his constituents better than Augusta, but it did not follow that he ought to vote for one of those towns, for either of them might not accommodate the State as well as Augusta. \"From all considerations he was led irresistably to the conclusion that Augusta was the place which we ought to select.\" It might be said that he was prejudiced in favor of Augusta, living in a county contiguous to Kennebec. He acknowledged that Lincoln and Kennebec had a common interest, and always would have, as long as they were washed by the waters of the Androscoggin and Kennebec, but he believed there were substantial reasons for the selection, and named \"its being central as to territory, population and representation ; it was a place where the public records and public offices might be kept in security in case of wars ; it was a place where the business of legislation might be carried on with less embarrassment and more purity than in a large town.\" The question of striking out the resolves was decided in the negative fifty-one to sixty-nine. Mr. Adams moved to amend by striking out \"1830\" and inserting \"1840.\" Mr. Vance of Baring thought it not necessary to extend the time to 1840; was himself in favor of Waterville, but as there"], [506, "474 Legislative Action. 1827. was no prospect of going there he should vote for Augusta. He always was of the opinion that we should locate our seat of gov ernment on the Kennebec. Mr. Swan of Portland had waited patiently to hear some good reason for agitating the question at the present time ; he had heard none. A new census would be taken in 1830 ; the legisla ture would then \"be better qualified\" to settle the question. The State was not prepared for the taxation necessary to erect public buildings. The unsettled lands might vary the relative situation of our population. The motion was negatived, forty-one to seventy-two. It was now moved to insert \" 1835.\" Mr. Davis was not particular about the year ; 1831 or 1832 he would agree to, but thought a longer time unnecessary. He discussed the question at length, and was followed by other gentlemen. Dr. Shaw of Wiscasset made a set speech in favor of the location at that place. When the motion was put, it was carried in favor of 1835 by a vote sixty-seven to sixty-six. Mr. Carpenter of Howland then moved to insert \" Ban gor\" in place of \"Augusta.\" Mr. Vance opposed, and said, \"in both wars the enemy had scoured the Penobscot.\" The motion failed. Mr. Cobb of Waterville then moved to insert \" Water ville,\" which he and Mr. Vance advocated, but the motion was lost. After further discussion and the loss of proposed amend ments, the resolves as amended by inserting \"1835\" instead of \"1830\" were passed to be engrossed, by a vote of eighty-three to fifty-six. The resolves now went to the Senate, but on account of some mistake in relation to the deed mentioned in the second resolve, were recalled by the House, amended, and finally referred to a committee and passed in a new draft. In the Senate they were committed and reported in still a new draft and passed. When they again came up for action in the House, the \" game to divide and conquer,\" which had been played hitherto, was again suc cessfully adopted. The resolves were now amended providing that a committee, to be appointed, should examine some seven towns ambitious of the honor of being the seat of government, and if they should determine and report that Augusta was preferable to either of them, and the legislature should accept the report, it should settle the question in favor of Augusta. This omnibus amendment, intended to defeat the measure by"], [507, "1827. Legislative Action. 475 combining all hopeful interests in opposition was carried, eighty to fifty-one, and the resolves as amended passed and were sent to the Senate. The Senate rejected them, and passed new resolves providing the place and estimate for public buildings, and that the next legislature should meet at Portland. The Senate's resolves were now rejected in the House which voted to insist on its former resolves. Conferees were appointed. They could not agree, and recommended that no further action be taken on the subject. A resolve was then introduced into the House and passed, pro viding that the legislature should meet annually in Portland until otherwise ordered. In the Senate this was amended on the motion of Mr. Southwick of Kennebec, by providing that the next legisla lature shall meet in Hallowell, and as amended passed by a vote of ten to eight. In the House the Senate's amendment was adopted without debate, yeas sixty-seven, nays fifty-nine. On motion to reconsider this vote a long debate ensued, when ' the question was decided in the negative fifty-nine to sixty-five. The resolve was then passed and approved by the governor. It was now perceived by those who had long opposed fixing upon a place for the permanent seat of government, that their op position had changed the temporary place of meeting, and they came cordially into the support of a measure, which had been fully discussed in the legislature and out of it, for fixing upon Augusta as the permanent seat. The question heretofore had been one of time, when to remove, rather than the place where. It is noticeable that no vote had passed either branch of the legislature fixing on any place but Augusta for the permanent seat of government. A bill was now introduced into the House, by Mr. Vance, pro viding that on and after January 1, 1832 \"the permanent seat of government shall be established at Augusta,\" and until that time the legislature should annually hold its session at Portland, and authorizing the governor and council to obtain a conveyance to the State of a suitable lot of land in Augusta on which to erect the public buildings, provided the same can be had without ex pense to the State, and that five hundred dollars be placed at the disposal of the governor to enable him to cause to be fenced, im proved aud ornamented with trees, such lot as may be conveyed to the State, aud that all laws and resolves inconsistent with the act be repealed. This bill was advocated by Mr. Adams of"], [508, "476 Augusta the Seat of Government. 1827. Portland, and opposed by Mr. Evans of Gardiner, and passed by eighty-one yeas to thirty-eight nays. In the Senate it passed by eleven yeas to seven nays, and on the 24th day of February was approved by the governor. Thus after the report of a committee, appointed by the Governor and Council under a resolve of the legislature, recommending Au gusta as the place for the permanent seat of government, and the full investigation and report of committees repeatedly appointed by the legislature in favor of that place, and after full discus sion by five successive legislatures of the question of the perma nent location of the seat of government, Augusta was fixed upon, with the unanimous consent of the county of Cumberland, which had been most strenuous in its opposition to the agitation of the question. The counties of York and Oxford strongly favored the decision, as did also Hancock and Washington. Kennebec was divided by the influence in favor of Hallowell ; Somerset by the aspirations of Waterville, a place nearer to that county ; and Lincoln by views favorable to Wiscasset, a town within her own borders.1 At the annual meeting in March, the act establishing the seat of government in Augusta was read, and Daniel Cony, Joshua Gage and James Bridge were chosen a committee \"to inform the Gover nor that whenever a lot of land whereon to erect the State house should be selected, pursuant to the provisions of the act afore said, the same shall be conveyed to the State free of expense,\" and the committee, with the selectmen, were \"authorized and requested,\" when the Governor and Council shall visit the town 1 The yeas and nays on the passage of the act establishing a seat of govern ment are interesting, and are by counties, as follows : Senate.

Pursuant to previous notice, on the fifth day of June1, Gov. Lin coln and his Council met at Augusta, and, accompanied by the committee, the selectmen and several gentlemen from various parts of the State, proceeded to select a site for the public build ings. After examining various places on both sides of the river, it was determined to take the lot originally selected by the com missioners in 1822. This lot, upon which the State House now stands, was, on the sixth day of June, conveyed to the State by Joshua Gage, Joseph Chandler, Robert C. Vose, Henry W. Fuller, Pitt Dillingham and Reuel Williams. It is forty-two rods wide and about one hundred and thirty rods long, reaching from the old Hallowell road to the river, and contains thirty-four acres.\" The governor expressed his gratification that in making the selec tion no attempt had been made to influence him or any member of the council in favor of one part of the town over the other, and \"that rival interests of individuals did not disturb the perfect har mony of the citizens.\" In the autumn, Col. Edward Williams was appointed to super intend the expenditure of the small appropriation made for setting out trees upon the lot and preparing for the foundations of the buildings. Gov. Lincoln, upon the assembling of the legislature in January of the next year, called attention to the necessity of providing public buildings, and suggested the public lands as the means of accomplishing the object. This portion of his message was referred to a committee, which reported resolves providing for the appointment- of a commissioner of public buildings, and appropriating certain townships of land for their erection. These resolves were opposed in the Senate by the three members from Cumberland and one from Oxford, but were passed V the votes of the sixteen other senators.

The \"young men\" celebrated Independence this year, in an appropriate manner, under the direction of Col. Edward Williams, Alfred Redington and James Bridge, Jr., as a committee of arrange ments. Luther Severance was orator ; dinner was served by Palmer, at the court house, at which Daniel Williams presided assisted by Elias Craig, Jr. and R.ufus Chandler Vose ; William L. Wheeler acted as chief marshal assisted by Frederic A. Fuller. The orator modestly remarked in the Journal in speaking of his performance, that, for \"the attention with which it was received, more credit was due to the politeness of the audience than to the merits of the address.\" But Joseph J. Eveleth probably thought otherwise, as he complimented him by the following toast : \" The Editor of the 'Folio of four pages,' like Luther of old, he fearlessly attacked the corrupt institutions of the day ; may he as eminently succeed in diffusing the principles of political orthodoxy.\" Henry W. Fuller, Jr., in allusion to a local enterprise, gave : \"Waterville and Augusta, twin sisters, united by interest \u2014 dam the Kennebec and lock them together.\" Oak street was laid out this year, \"reserving to James Bridge the right to occupy the ground where the North house stands, which is partly in said street, so long as it shall continue to be occupied as a dwelling house.\" This was the dwelling house of the late Judge North, which he occupied from his early settlement to within a few years before his death, which occurred in 1825. On the night of Thursday, the 28th day of September, E. L. Ham lin of Bangor with his wife and child in a chaise crossed the Ken nebec bridge, and by direction of the toll-gatherer proceeded to find Palmer's tavern, but missed his way and continued on Bridge street to a place where the road is narrow, with a precipice on one side. In endeavoring to turn, it being very dark, the horse backed the chaise over the bank, and all were \"precipitated twenty or thirty feet down among the bushes.''

This was at the north end of Elm street, where Daniel Woodward since built a house."], [511, "1827. Political. 479 Great interest attended an active canvass for county senators this year. A convention of delegates from all the towns in the district assembled at Augusta and nominated Reuel Williams, Joel Wellington and Edward Fuller. Mr. Williams, who had been senator the two previous years, received the nomination by thirty four out of forty-four votes thrown. The other gentlemen were not selected with so great unanimity. Opposition immediately arose. It was said the candidates were opposed to the national administration, and conventions were called and held in Water ville and Hallowell which nominated other candidates said to be more friendly, and in favor of a change of one of the United States senators from Maine, who was said to be hostile to the administra tion of Mr. Adams. Mr. Williams was opposed, partly on local ground, by the towns where the opposing conventions were held, and partly by leaders having views of their own to carry out. Severance, in the Journal, endorsed the regular nomination as politically sound, and defended Mr. Williams against the attacks made upon him. The town, when it came together at the Septem ber election, polled the unprecedented vote of 541 for governor, all of which were for Enoch Lincoln. Reuel Williams had 542 for senator, and the other gentlemen nominated with him nearly the same number. In relation to them there were but four scattering. Mr. Williams had the largest number of votes of any candidate in the county which formed the district, and was elected with Nathan Cutler and Joshua Cushman of the opposing ticket. This was the first division which disturbed the political harmony in Kennebec since the \"separation.\" The following year, 1828, parties were forming with a view to the Presidential election. A meeting of the members of the legis lature with other persons from all parts of the State \"openly and decidedly friendly\" to the reelection of John Quincy Adams was called, to, assemble at Portland, in January, to \" consider the sub ject of electors,\" and adopt measures in favor of the national ad ministration. At this meeting electors at large were nominated, and an address to the people and resolutions were adopted. Reuel Williams put himself on record at this meeting as a friend of the administration, by being present and participating in its proceed ings. As usual, the county committee called county and senato rial conventions, to assemble on the ninth of August, at the court house, in Augusta, to nominate a county and senatorial ticket. A"], [512, "County and Senatorial Conventions. 1827. 480 number of gentlemen from different towns in the county called another convention of delegates, \"of open and undoubted attach ment to the national administration,\" to assemble for the same pur pose, at the same place, on the eleventh day of August. The two conventions met at the appointed times. The same delegates were chosen from some towns to attend both conventions. Similar resolutions were passed in the conventions sustaining the adminis tration of President Adams, and censuring John Chandler, senator in Congress, for his opposition to the administration ; and both prominently recognized the fact that two senators in Congress were to be selected by the next legislature. The first convention nominated Reuel Williams, Nathan Cutler and Joshua Cushman for re-election as senators ; the last nominated the two latter, and substituted Sanf'ord Kingsbury for Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams immediately- declined the nomination of the first convention \"having been honored\" \u2014 as he said \u2014 \"with a seat in the Senate for the last three years,\" and \" being unwilling to be the cause\" of division. Upon the assembling of the legislature in 1829, as the two conventions desired, John Chandler was proscribed, and Pelcg Sprague elected in his place. This made a vacancy in the Kenne bec congressional district, and Gov. Lincoln appointed the sixth day of April for filling it. Now commenced a memorable struggle the sequel of former divisions. A number of gentlemen were nom inated as candidates in the public prints, the most prominent of whom were Reuel Williams and George Evans. Severance, in noticing them remarked, \"we cannot oppose either ; they are both able and good men;\" but in contrasting their merits, he plainly gave preference to Mr. Williams, by passing a high eulogium on his character. He had previously said, \"We do not seek to con trol, but to record the public will.\" He united in a circular with Joshua Gage, Williams Emmons, Henry W. Fuller, Thomas W. Smith, Watson F. Hallett and others, recommending Mr. Williams to the electors for their suffrages. When the day of election came there was no choice, but Wil liams led Evans nearly five hundred votes. Gen. Jesse Robinson, the candidate of the Jackson men, had five hundred and seventy six, Timothy Boutelle one hundred and thirty-seven, with three hundred and ninety-seven scattering. The Journal in comment ing on the election remarked, that \"Williams, Evans and Boutelle"], [513, "1827. Kennebec Congressional Election. 481 were supporters of Mr. Adams' administration,\" and that the canvass \" revived some local jealousies which had begun to pass into oblivion.\" The 20th of July was named for a second ballot. In order to concentrate on a candidate to unite the \" anti- Jackson strength,\" a call was made for a convention by four prominent men of the district who happened to be Mr. Evans' friends. This was ad dressed to \" republicans who were openly and decidedly in favor of the reelection of John Q.Adams.\" They were requested to meet at the court house in Augusta on July 9th. At this conven tion of George Evans' friends he was nominated, with only one dissenting vote for Reuel Williams. Fifteen towns in the district claiming to be friendly to Mr. Williams were not represented, and the six delegates from Augusta did not take part in its delibera tions. The Journal declared that by throwing the odium of Jack sonism most unjustly upon Mr. Williams, \"the friends of Mr. Evans have carried their point in obtaining his nomination.\" Mr. Williams, however, was nominated in the public prints and by printed circular signed by influential friends. The canvass which followed was 'animated and warm, and re sulted in the election of Evans by one hundred and four majority. With the exception of one hundred and one scattering the votes were divided between Williams and Evans. Augusta polled seven hundred and thirty-eight for Williams, twenty-seven for Evans. six for Williams Emmons and three for Abijah Smith \u2014 an unpre cedented vote of seven hundred and seventy-four. This large vote led to the suspicion and charge, in the American Advocate, of ille gal voting by persons at work upon the public buildings which were then being erected in Augusta. The charge was indignantly repelled by the selectmen, who published a card stating that they made two lists of voters ; one comprised the inhabitants of the town, numbering nine hundred and twenty-four, of whom seven hundred and eleven voted ; the other was a list of the workmen on the public buildings, numbering one hundred ants thirty-three, of whom sixty-two only were found qualified and permitted to vote. Mr. Williams had written a letter, early in January, prior to the first ballot, which found its way into the Journal before the second ballot, in which he declared, \"I have uniformly acted with the friends of the State administration until they divided on the Presi- 31"], [514, "United States Arsenal. 1827. 482 dential question, and in that I could not prefer Jackson to Adams, and separated from friends whom I highly esteem. Gen. Jackson has succeeded, and I am content to judge his administration by his measures.\" It is not surprising that the heated contest and doubt ful attitude in which some chose to place him, should have left Mr. Williams in a condition to have subsequenty united with the dem- ocratic party. Mr. Harrison of the United States Senate, reported a bill from the Committee on Military Affairs, January 16, 1827, to establish an arsenal at Augusta, which became a law March 3d of the same year. The act required the Secretary of War \"to purchase, as soon as can be effected on reasonable terms, a site for an arsenal in the town of Augusta in the State of Maine, and cause to be erected such an arsenal as may be deemed proper for the safe keeping of arms and munitions of the United States for the northern and eastern frontier.\" Major Talcott of the United States Engineers was here in June following to make surveys, with a view to the selection of a site by the Secretary of War. A number of lots were examined on each side of the river, but the present location combining the greatest advantages was purchased, and in September proposals were issued for materials to construct the arsenal buildings under direction of Lieut. J. Hills. The appropriation for the arsenal from estimates by Col. George Bomford of the Ordnance department was $15,000, for a small depot for military stores to be supplied from the Watertown arsenal. Upon further consideration it was perceived that these posts were two hundred miles apart, and the water communication between them was liable to be cut off by an enemy, and was cut off during the last war. The Colonel reported February 20, 1828, that \"a part of the country so much exposed, and liable to become the seat of war, requires that an arsenal upon a scale adequate to furnish the military supplies for its defence should be established,\" and he recommended suitable buildings of proper dimensions, adapted to the various purposes of an \" arsenal of large size such as would be requisite for fabricating military supplies ;\" and for this purpose an additional appropriation of $30,000 was made. On the 14th of June, 1828, the corner stone of the main building of the arsenal was laid. March 27, 1829, a further appropriation of $45,000 was made, and the buildings numbering fifteen were"], [515, "1827. United Slates Arsenal. 483 erected, ten of them of blocks of unhammered granite, laid in ashler courses in the most thorough and permanent manner. The lot, embracing forty acres, was enclosed with a heavy iron fence, eight feet high, upon a substantial foundation of granite deeply imbeded, and a heavy bank wall of the same durable material was built upon the river, with a wharf of granite at which vessels draw ing ten feet of water can lay in the drought of summer. Large sums were expended from time to time in addition to the appro priations, for erecting the buildings, grading the grounds and placing the post in a completed condition for the purposes for which it was designed. The arsenal is one hundred feet long by thirty feet wide, and three stories high, with a spacious basement. It is elevated forty five feet above low water mark, and is 211 feet from the river. In the first story 2640 boxes of national armory muskets may be stored ; in the second story 2376 ; in the third 2112. The larger magazine will contain 600 barrels of powder, the smaller 254. The other buildings are a storehouse eighty feet by thirty, two stories high ; officers' small quarters, barracks, offi cers' large quarters, stable, blacksmith shop, armorer's shops and wheelwright's shops. Lieut. Hills, in command of the station, was relieved by Capt. C. Mellen, Second Artillery, May 20, 1831. He continued in com mand until the last of May, 1833, when he was relieved by James W. Ripley, Captain of Ordnance, who took great interest in grad ing and improving the grounds. By his recommendation the lot was enlarged and fenced with iron pickets, the wharf built and other improvements made. On the 25th of October, 1834, Capt. Ripley requested \"orders to perform a short tour of duty in the course of the winter at the Alleghany arsenal under the orders of Major Baker,\" for the purpose of acquiring a practical knowledge of duty as Captain of Ordnance, and that Lieut. Robert Anderson might be temporarily detailed for ordnance duty, and assigned to the command of the post during his absence. This request was granted, and Lieut. Anderson relieved Capt.

Anderson, afterwards as Major in command of Fort Sumter, had the distinguished honor of making the celebrated defence of that fortress against the first shock of the great Rebellion. In June, 1835, Capt. Ripley was temporarily relieved, for a few"], [516, "1827. 484 United Slates Arsenal. months, by Lieut. George S. Green. Returning, he continued in command until May, 1841, when he was appointed Superintendent of the Springfield armory. Lieut. R. A. Wainwright succeeded Capt. Ripley, and was in command in December, 1846, when he was ordered to Mexico during the war with that country. In his absence, until December 1848 when he returned and resumed command, James L. Child, his father-in-law, acted as military store-keeper. Lieut. Wainwright was finally relieved, September 5, 1851, by Capt. F. D. Callender, who had seen service in the Mexican war. Lieut. 0. 0. Howard succeeded Capt. Callender December 5, 1855. He remained but a few months, until July 18, 1856, when Capt. I. Gorgas took command. Lieut. Howard was appointed Colonel of the Third Maine Infantry, and left with it for the South when the rebellion broke out. He was rapidly pro moted, and served as Brigadier-General with distinguished valor at the battle of Gettysburg. As Major-General he led one wing of Sherman's army on its celebrated march from Atlanta, through Georgia to Savannah and from thence through South and North Carolina to Virginia. Capt. Gorgas continued in command until June 1, 1858, when he was relieved by Lieut. J. W. Todd, who was succeeded on the 25th of October of the same year by Briscoe G. Baldwin of Virginia, as military store-keeper. Baldwin was in command at the commencement of the rebellion, and was offered the charge of the State Arsenal of Virginia. When that State seceded he resigned and left for the South. June 1, 1861, Benja min H. Gilbreth of Augusta, was placed in charge as military store-keeper, and continued to 1869, when he was ordered to and left for California. Maj. James M. Whittemore is the officer now in command. During the Mexican war rockets were made and fixed ammu nition prepared at the arsenal, and forwarded in considerable quan tities. The land and buildings were valued June 10, 1855, at $155,154, and the military stores at $394,735.80, among which were 24,313 muskets, 1,936,300 pounds of musket powder \u2014 nearly 1000 tons \u2014 and 50,000 pounds of cannon powder, besides shot, shells and cannon. These were at the arsenal at the commence ment of the rebellion, and were forwarded to the seat of war. Large quantities of fixed ammunition were prepared at the arsenal during the war ; and it was made a depot of valuable military stores, amounting at times to one million and an half of dollars. When attempts were being made by rebel emissaries to burn"], [517, "1827. Maine Patriot and State Gazelle. 485 northern cities, it was supposed that they might reach Augusta from Canada, and try to destroy the arsenal with its military stores, and a vigilant watch was kept. One dark night, about midnight, the sentinels on the wharf discovered a boat filled with men ap proaching without noise. They were challenged, but failing to answer a few shots were fired at them, when they fled and were not heard from afterwards. On the twenty-eighth of August James Dickman issued pro posals to publish, at Augusta, the \"Maine Patriot and State Gazette.\" He claimed patronage of the public on account of his \"strictly republican principles,\" and his intention to \"tenaciously adhere to the doctrines which were advanced by Jefferson and Madison, those great luminaries that shed so much glory upon the political horizon of America.\" Dickman had published the \"Columbian Star,\" a paper started at Alfred, in York county, to support William H. Crawford for the Presidency. After that paper was discontinued he published the \"Dover Gazette,\" a paper in opposition to the administration of' President Adams. A number of citizens opposed to Mr. Adams, and ardently in favor of Gen. Jackson for the Presidency, were instrumental in starting the Patriot. The leaders were Edmund T. Bridge, John A. Chandler, Edward Williams and Greenlief White. Wednesday, October 31st, the new paper, of a size somewhat larger than its contemporary, the \" Kennebec Journal,\" made its appearance under the editor ship of Aurelius V. Chandler, eldest son of Gen. Joseph Chandler. It was printed in the Page house, the same in which the Kennebec Intelligencer was printed in 1795. In the presidential canvass of the next year the \" Patriot\" was foremost in the contest for Gen. Jackson, and after his election, in May, 1829, it was sold to Harlow Spaulding, by whom it was published, at his store next to the Augusta bank, under the con tinued editorial charge of Mr. Chandler, who, in the fall of the following year, went south to recruit his health, where he died, in Charleston, S. C, December 31, 1830, at the age of twenty-three years. James W. Bradbury succeeded Mr. Chandler in the edi torial chair, but relinquished it July 1, 1831, and the paper was discontinued in December following having been superseded by \"The Age.\" Harlow Spaulding kept, at his bookstore on the east side of Water street nearly opposite Judge North's house, \"hats and"], [518, "Methodist Episcopal Church. 1828. 486 buffalo robes.\" He removed, in 1829, to the store formerly occu pied by Vose & Bridge. R. Bugden opened a store in No. 1 Arch Row in the fall of the previous year. William S. Craig had, January 4th, opened a new apothecary store in the building recently occu pied by Perkins & Ames, which was the \" Vose store,\"1 but soon removed to the south tenement of the Robinson & Crosby stores, where he formed a short copartnership with Dr. E. S. Tappan. Greenlief White and George W. Allen terminated the copartner ship of White & Allen in March, 1828 ; and White formed with Edward Williams the firm of White & Williams, who sold gro ceries at wholesale in store No. 6 Arch Row, erected by Edward Williams the previous year. William L. Wheeler had a \" new store and new goods \" in the Vose store, vacated by William Dewey for No. 7 Arch Row, which he with Pitt Dillingham had just built. William Bridge, the youngest son of Judge Bridge, had! opened a store iu his father's old office, which had been removed to a lot south of and adjoining Vose & Bridge's store. Horatic* Bridge had taken an office for the practice of law in Milburn, (now Skowhegan;) and Richard H. Vose, October 23d, had taken an office for the same purpose in No. 6 Arch Row, over White <fc Williams' store. Robert Goodenow of Wilton was appointed county attorney. Ariel Mann, judge of probate, died in March, and Henry W. Fuller was appointed in his place in June. The pioneer of Methodism in this section of the State was Elder Jesse Lee, of Virginia. In performing a missionary tour of the New England States, in 1793, he visited Hallowell and preached in the academy at the Hook, October 13th and 20th.* The first Methodist sermon preached in Maine, is said to have been delivered by Elder Lee, at Saco, September 10th of the same year. The first preacher of this persuasion, of whom we have an account as officiating at Augusta, was the Rev. Epaphras Kibbey, who, in the summer of 1800, lectured in the hall of the old Thomas house on the lot number thirty, just above Island brook. In the year 1802, Augusta was included in a circuit called the Hallowell circuit, organized that year, extending from Richmond to Bloom field, (now Skowhegan,) of which Ralph Williston was the Presiding Elder, and Comfort C. Smith and Aaron Humphrey were \"preach ers in charge.\" At this time, the society in Augusta consisted of one class of about twenty members, in the north part of the town, ' Vose store, next below the Kennebec House. s Gen.

The second class in Augusta was formed in the village, in 1807, and Elihu Robinson was appointed its first leader. He was a native of Attleborough, Mass.; joined the Methodists in Cumberland, R. I., in 1800, at the age of sixteen years, and removed to Wrentham, Mass., where he was appointed, at the age of twenty years, the first class leader in that town. The class at the village was small, and two years after its formation, in 1809, numbered but five persons. These were Elihu Robinson, leader, his wife, Susanna Robinson, Timothy Page and his wife, and Sally Hayward. In 1810 Japheth Beale with his wife removed from the north part of the town to the village, and the class soon increased to sixteen members under the united efforts of the two class leaders, Robinson and Beale, who may be regarded as the chief instruments in founding and promoting the early growth of the Methodist church in Augusta. The first Quarterly meeting in Augusta was held in the old court house the last day of November and first day of December, 1810; Oliver Beale at the time being Presiding Elder, and Zachariah Gibson \"preacher in charge.\" The first Love Feast was held in a shop where Robinson & Beale worked at chair-making, after wards a small dwelling at the corner of Winthrop and Summer streets. From this time, for eighteen years, until 1828, occa sional preaching was had, and the growth of the society was slow. The circuit including Augusta, at first so extensive, became divided and subdivided, until, in 1821, the towns of Augusta, Hallowell and Gardiner remained a circuit, and continued to be called by the original name, the Hallowell circuit. It numbered at this time three hundred and fourteen church members under the charge of the Rev. Charles Virgin. In 1827 the society in Augusta had so increased and strength ened as to take measures for erecting a meeting-house, the pews of which, in anticipation of building and to provide a fund for that purpose, were sold at auction, January 17, 1828, at the house of \"George W. Perkins, innholder.\" ' In the following November, the house, pleasantly situated on an eligible lot on Green street, was completed, and on the twenty-seventh of the same month dedicated; on which occasion the celebrated John Newland Maffit, of Portsmouth, N. H., preached the sermon from Haggai, second 'Perkins then kept the Kennebec House."], [520, "488 Augusta a Station. \u2014 Parsonage. 1828. chapter, seventh verse. The introductory prayer was offered by the Rev. Phineas Crandall of Wiscasset ; the dedicatory prayer by Rev. Sullivan Bray of Vassalborough ; and concluding prayer by Rev. Benjamin Tappan of Augusta. The chapel was not large, \"but a neat and well constructed building.\" Mr. Maffit preached a number of times at other houses of worship before leaving town, creating quite a sensation as a \"popular pulpit orator.\" The society now having a commodious house, this year Augusta was made \"a station,\" and Daniel B. Randall was appointed \"preacher in charge.\" He remained but a short time, and James Warren was appointed his successor. In 1829 Oliver Beale sup plied the station ; and during the two following years John B. Husted, under whose preaching there was a revival. The number of church members first appears at this time on the church records ; it was one hundred and thirty-six. The number increased to one hundred and seventy-three in 1837. In the fol lowing year the class in the north part of the town was set off to the Sidney station, and the number of members returned fell on account of the change to one hundred and five. The church how ever increased, particularly during a revival under the preaching of Albert T. Barnard, in 1841, when one hundred were added to its number, which in that year reached two hundred and sixty three. Two years after the number had reached three hundred and five, but subsequently diminished. In 1847 \"a neat and commodious\" parsonage was built on the meeting-house lot, and \"comfortably furnished.\" The congrega tion worshipping in the church had become so large in 1848, as to require increased accommodation. This was provided, in accord ance with a plan originated by John Fisher for enlarging the house by cutting it into two parts and separating the parts so as to admit of an additional section, sufficiently large for twenty new pews. The singing gallery was taken out, and seats for the choir prepared nearly on a level with the floor. The pulpit and altar were greatly improved, the inside painted, a new carpet furnished and blinds provided for the windows. These improvements were regarded as \"forming an important era in the history of the society.\" After their completion a protracted meeting, continuing eight weeks, was held, which resulted in the addition of forty probationary members. During the year eighty-three were received on probation, and a net increase added to the church of fifty-seven members. In 1852 a small reed organ was purchased for the use of the choir, at an"], [521, "1828. Ministers in Succession. 489 expense of seventy dollars. The unusual amount of \"$706.43 of moneys for benevolent objects,\" was \"carried to conference\" in 1854.' The following year Rev. Stephen Allen was \"preacher in charge.\" It was a year of \"severe trial to the society; the Ken nebec dam had broken away ; the mills stopped ; and valuable members during the past two years had removed from town. Yet with commendable resolution the society improved the meeting house, and renewed its furniture ; repaired the parsonage, and built a convenient and commodious vestry under the church, in all which the \"Ladies' sewing circle\" rendered invaluable assistance in providing funds. This society has maintained sabbath schools, in addition to the one at their church on Green street, in the \"Chadwick neighbor hood,\" and at \"Munroeville,\" on Northern Avenue. The usual contributions, for various benevolent objects, have been statedly taken in this church, and during its varying fortunes, in prosperity and adversity, it is believed to have exercised a uniformly increas ing influence upon a community which it has been instrumental in training in the ways of peace and piety.

The spirit of improvement in church edifices had reached the Methodist society in 1867. In June of that year measures were taken for an enlargement and improvement of their house of wor ship. From a design by John C. Tibbetts, architect, the work was commenced in August by George H. Snow and the building raised five feet and seven inches, giving an audience room twenty four feet high. The roof was newly shingled ; the tower which sat upon the gable was taken down and a new tower built in front, surmounted by a ribbed spire of graceful proportion and ornamental finish, capped by a finial over one hundred feet from the ground. This enlargement gave entrance way in the tower and provided room for fourteen new pews. The old pews were suffered to remain but changed in color from sombre green to a graining of chestnut with black walnut trimmings, and the arched ceiling gave place to finely frescoed panel-work, and the walls were enriched by fresco with a cornice in fresco, and perforated by large orna mental windows of diamond shaped flecked glass. A new organ powerful for its size and of fine tone built by Hamill of East Cam bridge, Mass., was provided, also a new bell of greater weight than the old one. The building has the appearance of a new, finely proportioned, modern constructed house, all of which was accom plished at an expense not much exceeding seven thousand dollars. The election of Gen. Jackson to the Presidency, in the previous year, greatly encouraged the small minority in Maine who favored his election. .In Augusta his friends observed the 4th of March, the day of his inauguration, by a \"glorification at Palmers,\" at which about a hundred persons sat down to dinner. They were addressed by Edmund T. Bridge. Bells were rung, guns fired, and an uproar made as for a general jubilee. In legislative convention of the Adams men, who now assumed the name of National Republicans, Jonathan G. Hunton, of Readfield, was nominated a candidate for governor. The Jackson men, who called themselves Democratic Republicans, assembled in Augusta June 12th, and nominated Samuel E. Smith of Wiscasset for the same office. Their convention met in the Methodist chapel, the galleries of which were not sufficient to accommodate the specta tors, and it adjourned to the old south meeting-house, where it finished its deliberations. Col. Isaac Lane, of Hollis, acted as president, and Edward Kavanagh and Dr. Ingalls as secretaries. A warm gubernatorial contest ensued, characterized by personal"], [523, "1829. Corner-Stone of Stale House Laid. 491 abuse of the candidates, and resulting in the election of Hunton by a small majority. Some of the leading men in town, who had been Adams men, issued a circular to the electors, declaring Smith to be an Adams man, and justly claiming for him qualifications for the office supe rior to Hunton. The vote of Augusta for Hunton was two hun dred and eighty-two, for Smith one hundred and sixty-five, while at the same election Luther Severance, who was chosen represen tative, had three hundred and twenty-eight votes to ninety for Asaph R. Nichols who was on the Smith ticket. Hunton was un fortunate in some of his appointments to office, and was defeated the next year by Smith in a persistent contest which the Demo crats waged with the National Republicans for ascendency in the State Augusta polled three hundred and seventy-six votes for Smith, and two hundred and sixty-seven for Hunton, with seven scattering. At the same election Severance, as candidate for rep resentative, was defeated by Daniel Williams, democrat who had four hundred and thirteen votes to two hundred and fifty-six for Severance. The party lines were now distinctly drawn, and the ascendancy which the democrats acquired in the State they re tained, with the exception of two years in which the whigs pre vailed, for over twenty years. This year the anniversary of Independence, and the laying of the corner stone of the State House, were observed with unusual ceremonies and festivity. The day was announced at sunrise by the ringing of bells and a salute of twenty-four guns. At ten o'clock a procession was formed at Palmer's hotel, con sisting of the Grand Lodge of Maine, the Governor and Council, Secretary of State, Commissioner of Public Buildings, with dis tinguished strangers, and a large concourse of citizens of this and the neighboring towns. The procession moved under the escort of the Augusta Light Infantry, Capt. Rufus C. Vose, to Capitol hill, when the corner stone of the State House was laid with im posing Masonic ceremonies. Under the stone were deposited the Constitution of the State ; various publications of the day ; the coins of the country ; and a plate with the following inscription : State of Maine.

Governor Lincoln then delivered an address standing on the cor ner stone, to a large audience assembled upon the hill. After the address, the procession again formed and proceeded to \"Rev. Mr. Tappan's Meeting House,\" where an oration was delivered by Daniel Williams, which, says the Patriot, \"exceeded the most flattering expectations of his brilliant and numerous audience.\" After the address, the dignitaries present, with dis tinguished guests and numerous citizens, partook of \"an elegant entertainment prepared by Palmer,\" at which Judge Fuller pre sided, assisted by Gen. Joseph Chandler, Robert C. Vose and Elias Craig, Jr., vice presidents. One of the distinguished guests was Maj. Augustus Davezac, of Louisiana, a personal friend of President Jackson. Alluding to him, Edmund T. Bridge \"expressed the gratification derived from meeting on an occasion so interesting a citizen of that distant State,\" and proposed: \"The Slate of Louisiana \u2014 though not a party in acquiring our independence \u2014 she has, since her accession to the Union, nobly proved that she possesses the patriotism to defend it.\" After the deafening cheers which followed had sub sided, Maj. Davezac arose and eloquently responded to the remarks complimenting his State, Gen. Jackson and himself. \" Here,\" he said in relation to Maine, \"Here do I behold a scion detached from an ancient stock, which by culture and under the propitious smiles of Heaven blooming in the full luxuriance of mature vege tation, rivals already the parent trunk from which it has been so recently severed ; at the same time very fond recollection pictures to my memory the land of my residence as an exotic grafted on an indigenous tree, striking its fibres deep into the substance, liga ments and heart of its adopted parent, partaking of its identity, and in return for the support it has received, adorning it with its verdure, and covering it with its rich fruits.\" The ceremonies of the day brought to his mind what he had read in his boyhood of the Romans, who after dedicating their capital to the gods of the republic, asked the consent of the \"tutelary divinities\" to be"], [525, "1829. Major Davezac. 493 transferred to the new abode prepared for them. \"All were will ing to go save him who stood the sacred guardian of boundaries, and her who presided over youth.\" The oracle, consulted in this emergency, replied that the persistent refusal of the deities was a happy omen. \" It presaged that the frontiers of Rome would never recede before an invader; and that the Roman youth would ever remain unsubdued.\" The Major continued: \"This day, sir, \u2014 an auspicious day to lay the foundation of good works \u2014 you have laid the corner stone of the Capitol of Maine ; and though no material omen struck the eye or ear of the assembled multitude, though no eagle soared on the sight, in happy augury of rising empire ; though no lightning glared through the dark cloud ; though no thunder proclaimed the approving will of Heaven ; yet the meditating mind might, like the oracle of old, without fear of being contradicted by coming days, read in the firm and resolved aspect of men of mature years, aud in the ardent enthusiastic eyes of youth, the glad assurance that the frontiers of Maine will never recede before the footsteps of an invader, and that her youth, in the defence of their native land, never can be conquered.\" He closed with a sentiment: \" The Frontiers of Maine \u2014 Guarded in peace by the watchful solicitude of sages \u2014 in war, defended by the indomitable valor of an united and indivisible people.\" The North-eastern boundary of Maine was, at this time, a sub ject of agitation. Judge Preble, a few months after, was appointed Minister to the Netherlands to attend the arbitration of that ques tion, and Major Davezac was his Secretary of Legation, and al though our frontier has never receded before the heavy footsteps of an invader, yet it has yielded, ingloriously yielded, to the per suasive tongue and lighter tread of the diplomatist. The festivities of the day were closed by a fine display of fire works in the evening, some of which were sent up by Lieut. Hills, of the United States Army, from the east side of the river. Henry McCausland. With the company which came in the fall of 1760, to settle on Dr. Gardiner's estate at \"Cobbossee\" was Henry McCausland. He was married and had eight children, of whom Henry, the youngest, who was born the year previous, grew to man's estate ; served three years in the army, during the revo lution; married in 1783, and had five children. In 1793, he became insane on religious subjects, and imagined that his sins could only"], [526, "1829. 494 Henry Me Causland. be pardoned by a burnt offering and human sacrifice, which he fancied the Lord had directed him to make. Under this delusion he burned a church at 'Pittston, (now Gardiner,) and killed Abigail Warren, wife of Pelatiah Warren, of that place, by suddenly attacking her with a knife while in attendance at the bed of her sick mother. He was apprehended, confined in the Augusta jail, and indicted for murder. When arraigned, he pleaded guilty, and could not be persuaded to retract and substitute the plea of not guilty, insisting \" that no consideration could induce him to violate the truth.\" He was not sentenced, on account of his insanity, but remained in prison with his name borne upon the calendar of the court from term to term as a convict for murder, for more than thirty years. His stature was unusually large ; his manner grave and thoughtful; and when arraigned in court \"Judge Parsons remarked that he never saw a more imposing figure.\" In jail he suffered his beard to grow uncut, and as age advanced it became white and hung down upon his breast giving him a venerable ap pearance. He was remarkably neat in his person and apartment. During his long confinement in his solitary cell, he was visited by thousands, from whom he collected a small fee for permitting himself to be seen through the wicket of his cell door. The visitor was also entitled to hear him recount the story of his putting the \" wicked woman\" to death and burning the church. There were several other persons whom he was persuaded he had directions to kill. When Amos Partridge was jailor, his young daughter about nine years of age, of whom McCausland was very fond, was permitted to enter his cell to amuse him, as he appeared to be inoffensive. One day, however, he suddenly struck her with a billet of wood, nearly depriving her of life. After this he was put for awhile in irons. When the jail was burned, upon being liberated with other pris oners, he made no attempt to escape, but assisted in preventing the escape of others. . For some years he received a pension from government on account of his revolutionary service, a part of which was retained by the county to pay the expense of his con finement. From the balance and the gratuities he received he occasionally sent assistance to his family.

The Court of Sessions of Kennebec, at the December term, 1827, upon the memorial of Frederic Allen and other members of the Kennebec bar asking the erection of a new court house, decided, \" that a more convenient building should be erected for the better stone court house, 1829. accommodation of the county and public offices, as soon as cir cumstances will permit the same to be done with convenience and economy,\" and appointed Charles Hayden, Samuel Moody and James Cochran, members of the court, and Reuel Williams, Jesse Robinson and Robert C.

This report was accepted, a definite plan adopted, and James Cochran and Robert C. Vose were appointed to erect and complete the building. The site was, however, changed to its present location, which was purchased of Nathaniel Hamlen, January, 1829; for one thousand dollars. Robert C. Vose entered into a contract with the Court of Sessions for the erection of the new building, the corner stone of which was laid on Wednesday, the 29th of the following May, by Gen. Joseph Chandler, with brief ceremony, in presence of the workmen and a few spectators ; a plate was deposited under it, on which was engraved the date, names of the Governor of the State, Judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Sessions and Mr. Berry, the master builder ; two recent newspapers were deposited with it. In August the outside of the court house was finished, and in December Vose was settled with and \"released from the inside finish.\" Cochran had the credit of planning and superintending the erection of the building, which was conveniently arranged and well finished in the inside. On the outside it was substantial, plain, and barn-like, without belfiy. A small tower, however, was set up in the rear of the county offices at the southwest cor ner of thf lot, in which the bell was hung. This arrangement gave rise to waggish remarks from the odd appearance it had of a church having sunk, leaving its steeple above ground. The build ing was occupied for the first time on Tuesdajy the first day of June, 1830, at which time the Supreme Court commenced a session, when Judge Mellen, in delivering his charge to the Grand Jury, prefaced his address by some remarks on the convenience aud accommodation of the new building which he said was \"superior,\" for the purpose for which it was erected, \"to any other in the State.\" Gov. Enoch Lincoln, by invitation, came to Augusta on Monday the 5th of October, to deliver an address before the young ladies of the Cony Female Academy on the occasion of their public examination. He was in feeble health, but proceeded with his address, during the delivery of which he was obliged from weak ness to resume his seat, and continued seated to its close, when he retired with Gen.
