They are thus pointed out that the reader, who in the heat of political zeal has not quite loft his underftanding, may examine what there is in them injurious to truth, or the good of mankind, and find it, if he can. In different times and under different feelings, it will appear aftonifh ing that any one of thefe paffages were fupprefled, from any apprehenfion of political refentment : but fuch was the fact That the one unwarily retained fhould excite the anger which was teftified is ftill more aftonifhing. A fentence fo true as to have been repeated in a thoufand different modes : for all ftrong moral truths are fubjetS to fuch repetition. A fentence that, under a variety of forms and phrafeology, is proverbial in all nations. It ought however to be remembered, that the perfons offended, though violent, were few. Their intention doubtlefs was good : the fame cannot be affirmed of their intellect, Thofe who are acquainted with German literature, and who have read the drama entitled, Der Deutfiche Haufiuater, by the Baron von Gemmingen, will immediately perceive that the author has availed himfelf of various incidents and thoughts in that piece ; though his fable, characters, and denouement are exceedingly different.

The previous knowledge of men and manners, and the extraordinary efforts of ftudy, time, and talents, which are neceffary to produce a play that has but a chance of being fanclioned by the town, are fufficicntly obvious. The labourer is worthy of his hire. In the be ginning of the prefent century, the price of an oclavo play was eighteen pence. Since that period, the price of pa per has been doubled ; the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the fame ratio ; and advertifing, which now amounts to a confiderable fum, was then a burthen un known. It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchafe of the copy-right, added to the above cofts, occafioned plays to be a dangerous fpeculation. The new tax on paper, in addition to all thefe, has made it impoffi ble, at the former price, to reward authors, and afford the bookfeller a reafonable hope of profit. Thefe confi derations have induced an advance of price, at which it i* prefumed no juft reafoner will take offence. HO."], [7, "PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. Bernard.
