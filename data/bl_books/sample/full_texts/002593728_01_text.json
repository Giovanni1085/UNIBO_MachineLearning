THE IRISH WEDDXiMG- Billy Shakspeare was surely a wonder; King James he got up in an oak, He saw Hoopback Richard go under, Bnt the devil a word wot he spoke. Bill Cromwell he did not like sleeping alone, So of girls he had a store ; He took Lady Jane into keeping, And afterwards married Jane Shore. IRISH LOVE LETTERS. Sung and partly written by W. H. C. West. \" The dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play that tune.\" \"But, mother, you know they say that dogs will bark at the moon.\" \" Now how can he see the moon, when you know he is old and blind ? Blind dog.*-; can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the wind.** (Pig grunts.) Sung by Sam Collins. Sure won't you hear, \"What roaring cheer, Was spread at Paddy's wedding, O; And how so gay, They spent the day, From the churching to the bedding, O. First book in hand came Father Quipes, With the. bride's dada, the Baillie, O; While all the way to church, the pipes Struck up a lilt so gaily, O. Tune.\u2014 \"Pat's Curiosity Shop.\" Och faith I I'm a tight Irish lad, And so is my sister the same, Here's a letter just sent her by Pad, And Hoolagan makes out his name. Faith, the letter I've slyly got hoki of, It's an illigant article too, It's a secret that's not to be told of, And so I shall read it to you. CHOEUS. What a mighty fine thing is good laming, It makes all one's troubles so light ; That man had a deal of disarning, Who first learned to read and to write. No science, &c. Dr. Johnson invented gunpowder, Learning his mind did employ ; Dean Swift made the cannons lire louder, And was killed at famed Siege of Troy. So now I will leave off for the present, Though I have not half exhausted my store; And if these short stories are pleasant, By-and-by I will tip you some more. No science, &c. \"And now there is the pig uneasy in hia mind.\" \" But, mother, you know they say that pigs can see the wind.\" Then there was Mat, And sturdy Pat.

Sung by Mr. J. H. Ogden and Sam Collins. I greased my brogues and cut my stick In the latter end of May, sir, And up to Dublin I did sail, To walk upon the sea, sir. To England I resolved to go, To cut the hay and corn, And among the cockney girls to dance, From night until the morn. With my killy ma-crue, no heart more true For Billy O'Rourke in the boughil. When Pat was asked, Would his love last, The chancel echoed with laughter, O; Arrah fait, cried Pat, You may say dat. To the end of the world, and after, O.

Oh, it's a fine thing to have good health when you are ill. Your aunt is in good spirits, though she died last night, and hopes it will not be long before she has the pleasure ot seeing you. We are all well in the garrison. But Tim Foozle has deserted all alone by himself wid two or three others, and is not yet taken. They are all to be tried Inst night, but their sentence will not be known till the day before yesterday. The doctor tells me (bad luck to 'em, the doctor's among 'em), the doctor tells me I shall never be cured till I'm well, which great blessing I hope will be some time first, as the sooner the better for all three. But I must leave off or I shall never stop till I've finished. My own darling, may your happiness be as lasting as a snowball in a red-hot warming pan. Give my compliments to Mike Murphy, wid a mighty big thump of the head, and accept the same for yeurself. From yours, affectionately till death, Pat Hoolagan. What a mighty fine thing is Rood laming, It makes all our troubles so light ; That man had a deal of disarning, Who first learned to read and to write. Now, boys, too near the house don't court- ing go, d'ye mind, Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and blind. The days when they were young, forget they never can ; They're sure to tell the difference 'twixt a fiddle, a dog, or a man. I met a man in College-green, And ax'd him the way to the Quay, sir, He was seated on a big white horse, And not one word would he say, sir. Neither hat, nor spur, nor whip he'd got, And both his stirrups he had lost ; Says I, \" My boy, if your horse doe3 stir In the street you'll surely be tost.\" With my killy ma-cruej &c.

A Celebrated Irish Comic Song, as sung by Sam Collins. Tune,\u2014 \" Judy Cullagkan.\" 'Twas last Sunday morn, To me the news was carried, That Pat and Judy Conner, Were going to be married ; I saddled my donkey quick. And gave him such a whack, With my large shilelah stick. I was after them in a crack. Oh what joys ! Nothing we were dreading: Roaring boys, Were all at Paddy's Wedding ! So then I rode away, x K'Ivl' mtuj'ipi _iiu six. miiiet. us, To carry me over to Pargate. But ere we got on hal* the road It blew at the devil a own hard rate. The big stick that grows out of the ship, Sung out like auy whistle, And the sailors all both great and small, Swore we were going to the devil. With my killy ma-crue, &c. Now, some were on their bended knees, The ladies were a fainting, But [ fell on my bread and cheese, Determined to mind the main thing. Says the captain \"Are you not afraid ?** Says I, \"I don't care a farthing ; I've paid you to bring me to Pargate, you know, And faith you must stand to your bargain.\" With my killy ma-crue, &c. But soon the wind sung itself to sleep, And we came to the place of landing ; The gentlemen who were most afraid, The ladies out were handing ; Says I, \" My boys, I have no doubt, But you have all got riches, And though you have not got skirts to your coats, You've cloth enough in the plats of your breeches.\" And then at night, Oh ! what delight To see them all footing and prancing, O. An opera ball Were nothing at all, Compared to the style of their dancing, O. And then to see old Father Quipes, Beat time with his shelaly, O; While the chaunter, with his merry pipes, Struck up a lilt so gaily, O. Till I came to mother Leary's, There I heard them say, They were going unto St. Mary's I flew there in a trice, And there was such a rout, Together they were spliced, And all a-coming out. Oh 1 what joys, &o: Together then we strolled, And now the knot So tipsy are got, They'll go to sleep without rocking, O. So the bridemaids fair, Now gravely prepare, For throwing of the stocking, 0 ; And round to be sure did go the wipes, At the bride's expense so freely, O; While to wish them good night, the merry pipes Struck up a lilt so gaily, O. Here's my sister's reply to the letter. She got the ould parson to write, Faith I don't think you could find a better, It took 'em a whole day and night. There isn't so much as a blot in, Which just shows how careful they were, A great deal of news she has got in Small compass, more credit to her. What a mighty fine thing, &c. Spoken.\u2014 You see my sister Judy is mighty careful, and for fear the direction might get rubbed out, she sealed the letter and then wrote it inside. Now then, she begins wid the day of the month :\u2014 \" May 42nd, 1 48. My dear Patrick.\u2014 If this letter does not come to hand, you may conclude that I am not here nor anywhere else, but gone to Clonikilty. Tell Barney I am happy to say his family is all dead intirely, barring the cat, and the cow is as good a mouser as ever. I love you as usual. I would write you more, but as there is no means of sending you this letter I'll just let it go as it is, and believe me to be, Yours, your own Judy Callaghan. (Turn over). P.S. (That means late at night.) If this letter does not reach you, let me know by return of post, and don't wait till you hear from me again, but write to me imme diately and let me know how you are getting on. N.B. (That means early in the morn ing.) I've altered my mind and won't send you this letter after all, so you can answer it or not just as you please. And when you come to the end of it don't read any more, but just answer by the first return of Post Oilice. Yours, Judy, once more.\" What a mighty fine thing is good laming. It makes all our troubles so light ; That man had a deal of disarning, Who first learned to read and to write. To Judy Connor's mother; In the door we rolled. One a-top of t'other. There was Larry, Kate, Besides a dozen more ; Patrick with his head, He split the cupboard door. Oht what joys; &0. WHAT A TREASURE IS LEARWIKG. Sung by Mr. J. Russell, at the White Conduit House Shades, Old Cyder Cellars, Bagnigge Wells, &c. With my killy ma-orue, &c. As I was going along the road, I met a gentleman, sir. \" Good morrow to you, sir,\" said I, But he proved a mighty toad, sir, For at the corner of a lane. He pulled a pistol out, sir, And clapped the muzzle to, oh I what a shame, Up to my very throat, sir. With my killy ma-crue, &c. \" Your money, bad scran to your Irish eyes!\" \" Be merciful,\" cried I, sir; But he swore he'd blow out both my eyes, If I'd either stir or cry, sir. His pistol to my head did pop, Two steps I did retire. The pan it flashed, his head I smashed, Och, shillelah, you never missed fire ! With my killy ma-crue, fco. We all sat on the ground, Singing altogether. The whiskey it went round, With hearts light as a feather ; There wan strong beer, ale, and toast, Butter to spread the crumpet, A little pig to roast, All your bellies to comfort. Oh I what joys, &o. The supper being done, 'Twas break of day in the morning ; We swore we'd have some fun, All fear and danger scorning. I gave Connor such a blow, Cause he struck my mother\u2014 And all at once you know, Fell whacking one another. Oh I what joys, &c. Just like a lump of lead, Och, hone ! what a treasure is learning, Then listen each ignorant elf, And if you have got any discerning, I'll make you as wise as myself. I went to O'Donough College, With my sister and a great many more, And I learnt such a rare stock of knowledge, As never was got at before. No science to me is a mystery, I have read every book through and through; I always was fondest of history, Because, you all know, it is true. Alexander the Great was a hero, For fighting there never was such ; He and the Emperor Nero Conquered the French and the Dutch. To come over here they intended, And with shipping they tried to make port, But their progress was safely prevented By Queen Bess at Tilbury Fort. No science, &c. Together we both went down, Against the bedstead leg, I broke his collar bone ; Then Connor out of spite, To please his heart's desire, He ran and got a light, And set the house on fire I Oh I what joys, &c. We all ran out together, Were frightened out of breath : The goods, and every feather, They all were burnt to death. Away we all did run, But not a word we said, I saw no more of the fuu, But tumbled intobed. Oh 1 what joys, &o. THE \"WHISTLING THIEF. Published by Duff and Co. Sung by Sam Collins and Mr. J. II. Ogden. Blind Homer, he was a great scholar, As ever in England was seen ; A pug dog he led by the collar. And he lived upon Bethnal Green.

When Pat came o'er the hills, his Calleen fair to see, His whistle loud and shrill, his signal was to be; (Shrill whistle) \"Oh I Mary,\" the mother cried, \"there's some one whistling, sure.\" \"Oh ! mother, you know it's the wind that's whistling through the door.\" (Whistles \"Garry Owen.\") LADIES' COMIC SONG.

Nex one, dis de Quaker, dey call Bright Jl'/lll, They say Queen don't like him, she told Palmerston, So they give him no office in de ministry, Never mind, to get reform, more time will have he. They had a boy, about fourteen, And he was anything but green ; He knew all slang patter so keen. From \" What's your game \" to '. Allserene.' To ape his father was his plan, And blowed his bacca like a man, They took him in their one-horse van, On Sunday ruralising. But on the 1st of April, that was my birth- day ; And on the morn when I was born as plainly you may see, I was one of the sweetest dears thero possi- bly could be. The nurse cried out 0 lal what a fine Will you buy my images, I images cry, &c. child you are: And tin. doctor he smiled, and said \" what a fine child,\" And he took a guinea from my dadda.

That on the morn when I was born I caused a great surprise. For the gossips come near and far, to comment my mamma, I was kissed and caressed, a__d by every one blest, And said I was a credit to my dadda. The nurse would often hug me, when sit- ting on her knee, She certainly said she never saw such a fine babby as me; For I never used to dirt about, I was so very clean, I had signs to make them understand when I wanted all serene.

Brown, ever after that mishap, Stuck to his barrow like a chap Who didn't care a single rap Who chaffed, but worked away quite slap.

But tell you a different story I can ; For he had no breeches at all to wear. Till mother Eve made him the first pair. What would you do without the ladies, &c.

I dream of thee, sweet Madoline, So beautiful and bright, My memory weaves each look of thine, With ev'ry thought of light. Thou art the music of my heart. That whispers through each day, That speaks thy name in ev'ry breeze. When far from thee away. I dream of thee, && All is hush'd, save night-winds stealing O'er the lime-trees and the river ; Sounds that call'd up gentlest feeling, Now have lost their charm for ever ; Who shall be first in the songs that we sing ? She who is kindest When fortune is blindest, Bearing through winter the blooms of the spring. Charm of our gladness, Friend of our sadness, Angel of life, when its pleasures take wing, She shall be fairest, She shall be rarest, She shall be first in the 6ongs that we sing- Aye, she shall be first in the songs that we siag. These lov'd haunts then fraught with glad- ness Can to me no joy impart ; Mem'ry brings alas ! but madness In this tempest of the heart. I dream of thee, dear Madoline, Through life's sad waste of years, Like spring's sweet breath to flowers that droop. Thy smiling face appears. Whene'er the world may cast its care, When sorrow near I see, I fear no shade, for in my grief, I turn again to thee. I dream of thee. See. Oh ! could I behold those glances Brighter than the stars above thee ; Hear that voice whose sound entrances, Breathing forth the words \" I love thee ;\" Why should such tones decay, And fleetly pass away, Hark to that roundelay, And music so cheering, Such lovely melody, Echoed far o'er the sea, Night's slumbers cannot be, To me more endearing. Our way now retracing. Homeward rejoicing, Repose soon embracing, Hail, dearest home. Thro' my bosom now so lonely Lightning rays of hope would dart : Thou canst with thy sunshine only Calm the tempest of my heart. Who shall be nearest ? Who shall be dearest ? Named but with honour and pride evermore, He the undaunted, Whose banner is planted On glory's high ramparts and battlements hoar. These lov'd haunts then fraught with glad- ness, Now to me no joy impart ; Mem'ry brings alas ! but madness In this tempest of the heart. LITTLE NELL. Music published by Cramer and Co.

My noble swells, if you want to fascinate the she sex, here's the right sort o' thing, that will do it in twenty minutes to no time at all. This celebrated pomatum is warranted to contain nothing injurious, and all things beneficial. It's as soft as a greenhorn at thimble-rig, but as strong aa the rock of Gibraltar, being composed of the softest Biibstances in nature: such as flint-stones, iron-filings, razor blades, darning-needles, broken bottles, hogs' bristles, pulverised hedge-hogs, red gravel, and blister-salve ; and, if well rubbed in night and morning for six years, will produce a most wonderful effect \u00a9n the head or chin ;\u2014 try it, and see if it don't. It will make the hair grow two inches a minute, and turn a bladder-of-lard pate into a raven head of hair, with curls as strong as double corkscrews ; only use this article, and all the girls will fall slap-bang in love with you, and go down on their .knees to beg a lock of your nobby head of hair. Its powers are so wonderful, that if you rub a pot on a plain deal egg-chest, it will turn it into a hair-trunk in an hour. Oh, you uncombed wretches that I see around me ! with heads of hair not fit for a cat to kitten in, take my advice, and make yourselves look like blessed angels, with flowing ambrosial locks, odorous as the per fumes of Araby, and no happy families in 'em. But if you won't take my advice, and a shilling pot, everyone of you, I leave you to your fate, and you'll have to resort to forks, for the rise in small tooth-combs will be awful. Only a shilling, and not above a thousand pots left, which, if not sold now, will be two bob to-morrow.

A tile\u2014 a castor \u2014 a skull case\u2014 a nut-shell, or whatever you please to call it, my pretty little dears. Look at this 'ere hat \u2014 there's a brimmer ! With a bit let in at the back\u2014 it will fit everybody. Just examine this hat, while 1 twirl it round on a stick. Ain't it a non-such, and a bit over? Don't I look well in it? (Puts it vn his htol). And if such a plain fellow as me looks well in it, what would your handsome, intelligent, phizzes be ? Just get into this hat, and if anybody asks you, \" Who's your hatter?'* tell 'em, Cheap Tom, and he's got plenty more worse than this, at a much higher price. Talk about the coat making the man\u2014 so does the hat. You may sport a cap on your knowledge box, but if i t's ever so good it don't get the respect a tile does. And there's the ladies like hats\u2014 they don't care if its glossy and new, or old hat. They seizedon the breeches long ago : now they've took our hats and coats. Blowed if they won't collar all that belongs to us soon, without being asked I Now it's a common saying\u2014 \"Get out of that hat ;\" but I want somebody to get into this hat, and hand me over the \"sugar \"\u2014alias the cash\u2014 for it. Now, who'll stand three half-crowns for this hat? Every inch of it beaver, where there's not a foot of silk. To cut pattering about it, I'll come down at once to half-a crown, and if I can't sell it at that, why, I'll give it away, like most of the world, to them as don't want it. Now, why is this hat like the French Emperor? Why, because it's Napjiy. Talking of him. why is the conclu sion of the Italian war like an unsuccessful drama? Well, because it's a bad peace (piece).

It gets the finny tribe in a line beautiful, and regular strings 'em to rights\u2014 with a hook. I used to keep it for myself when I was very religious, and went fishing on a Sunday ; and when I went in for perch, I was never knocked off my own perch, but pulled 'em out a bushel an hour. Tbe way I did it was this\u2014 I used to fix this rod on the bank, sing, \"Oh, let us be joyful\" backwards, and trust to Providence what it might hook, while I paddled off, todohalfan hour's chapel.

Now, you see, it's not a very large affair; but it's little and good, like a pill-box full of sovereigns. You can fish for compliments or cod with this article ; and if you want to catch a gudgeon, throw it among a crowd, and you'll soon hook one. Talk about bait \u2014now I've got a bait so nice and enticing, that if I bait my line with it, and drop it into an oyster bed, the natives open their shells, and jump on the hook of themselves.

And I never threw it in once in my life but always caught something, even if it was a damned bad cold ; and never missed getting a bite, if only from a bull dog. Only just get the right sort of tackle, and it will tackle the sea-serpent itself.

Our Parliament men smashed up \"Big Ben,'* When we'd paid thro' the nose ; Aud what do they send to make amends? Why, a clock that wrongly goes, Aud a bell to tell the hour, With forty horse sepulchral power ; Can't the *' Wiscount\" make nobs account For turning our feelings sour ? We can't endure that bell, &o. Whenever I call down in Whitehall, Or ramble down Parliament-street, I slop my ears to avoid dropping tears, For it sounds so low and sweet. It sounds like the knell of doom, Or a distant cannon's boom : Remove it they should, it's only good To knell folks to the tomb. We can't endure that bell, &c. There's no Government Job but ever the fob Of Bull they dip into To a tidy tune, and he finds out soon It's been a regular do. So with St. Stephen's bell, To growl he can't help well, As town around the horrible sound Goes of that fearful bell. We can't endure that bell, &c If it would ring 'twould be the thing, Fierce Despotism's knell ; We'll hail its sound, and sing around, And put up with the bell.

There's a land that bears a world known name. In the days of old, when forest and glade To the hunter's hound was free, The merry men rode, thro' brake and glen, To meet at the trysting tree. And there was seen in Lincoln green Full many a yeoman bold. With good yew bow for buck or doe, And a steed of stalwart mould ; And loud and lasting was their glee. As they drank to the brave old trysting tree. Tho' 'tis but a little spot ; 'Tis the first on the blazing scroll of fame, And who shall say it is not ?

With Truth for my creed, and God for my guide; She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer, As I knelt beside that old arm-chair. I have sighed and suffered long. Yet have never told my grief, In tbe hope that for my wrong, Time itself would find relief ; I will own no rebel thought, But I will not wear tbe chain, That for me must still be fraught, With but misery and pain.

This is the very age and body of the times ; and rather an aged body it is\u2014 a body that has worn out many a head. And what is a body without a head ? Why it's no body at all : wherein it implies that the head must be the body, and the body nobody, as a case in point. There is the head of the Church - which head is an expensive head, aheavyhead \u2014which head causes the body of the Church to stagger, and may cause the Church to fall \u2014which head is the head and front of the offending. Then there is the head of the People. This would appear to be a light head, which accounts for the people being light-headed ; hence it is that the body of the people are in want of reformation ; hence it is they are so flexible, so changeable, so credulous, so censorious, so uproarious, so notorious, so usurious, and vain-glorious; so intoxicated with vanity, so insane with chimera, so incompatible to truth, so pro lific in falsehood, and so in need of Reform.

Chords. It all were black, and dat a sac, As true as I'm a sinner; I'll tell you all, both great and small, About de grand black dinner. Paiteb.\u2014 Yes, it was in _7_c_moor.a_.et, in a dark room, with a black fireplace, wid a picture of Black Beard on one side, and Edward de Black Prince on the other. De company was all niggers, and caine in mourning coaches, in black suits, black hat bands, and black kid gloves. Mr. Black, dc host, had a black eye, and Mrs. Black wore black satin, and black looks. Dar was Sir Blackman, Mr. U/ac/.wcll, Mr. Blackmoia, Mr. Blackwood, Mr. and Mrs. Coals, and a lot of small black Coals. Two halves of de company come from .B/\"c7cfriars, five-fourths from Blackhe&th, de other two-thirds from BlackwM, and de rest from Blackpool. So altogether, you see \u2014 It all were black, and dat's a sac', As true as I'm a sinner; I'll you all, both great and small, About de grand black dinner. We had a black cook, and a black boy to wait, And eaois coloured gemman a ttocA-bordered plate ; Day hired Ethiopians to play black airs new, And de tablecloth it was as black as de flue.

Still,\" and de \" Mother Llack Cap.\" We eat till all black in de lace, aud- it all ware black, and dat's a sac', As true as I'm a sinner; I'll tell you all, both great and small, About de grand black dinner. Den after de dinner we all sung a song. And to de small hours de time did prolong, I tuned up de banjo to pitch, berry soon, And each coloured genelman sung a black tune.

Dar was a black look out! So dey turned us all out in de black midnight, and it was a black frost. And next morn- ing we all had to take a black draught, to work off de effects ob de black dinner. So dat\u2014 It all were black, and dat's a sac', As true as I'm a sinner, I've told you all\u2014 both great an' small\u2014 About de grand Black Dinner.

Air, \u2014 *T\\._'s Curiosity Shop.\" Mnsic published by Prowae. Sung by Mr. Ransford. The Pope he leads a happy life, He knows no cares of marriage strife, He drinks the best of Rhenish wine, I would the Pope's gay lot were mine ; But yet all happy's not his life. He loves no maid, nor wedded wife, Nor child hath he to cheer his hope\u2014 I would not wish to be the Pope. The Sultan better pleases me, He lives a life of jollity \u2014 Has wives as many as he will, I would the Sultan's throne then fill. And yet he's not a happy man, He must obey the Alcoran ; But dares not taste one drop of wine \u2014 I would not that his fate were mine. So here I'll take my lowly stand, I'll drink my own, my native land; I'll kiss my maiden's lip divine, And drink the best of Rhenish wine. And when my maiden kisses me, I'll fancy I the Sultan be; And when my cheery glass I tope, I'll fancy that I am the Pope. Shall we never meet again, love, As we used to in the past? And the bright links in love's chain, love, Be rudely snapped at last ? Yet my heart will still He thine, love, And its thoughts still cling to thee, Like the tendrils of the vine, love, Around the old oak tree. Many guides have been published and written.

Yet we never will repine, love, And my heart will cling to thee, Like the tendrils of the vine, love, Around the old oak tree.

I should be de . lighted, and should glory in it, if it were only to show lordly man how patient, how enduring woman can be when suffering in the cause she loves. Now ladies, muster, muster; enrol your names, and into the arms of the rifles ; leave gowns for guns ; ribbons for rifles. I'll make every maid a man, and every woman a master ; every married woman shall be a major, and every widow a general. All wedded wives shall pack up their husbands, and all single ladies their lovers, in the regimental bag- gage wagon, or leave them alone, just as they please. It is not at all against the articles of war to carry anything that is either useful or ornamental. Now, ladies, form, form. Be devoted to your home, Nor after senseless pleasures roam ; If coxcombs prate then cut their combs, Which very soon you can. Of sentimental men beware, Who love to flatter, fib, and swear, That your taste and beauty's past compare. Such is a dangerous man. Not but there are worthy men, but few and far between.

Although we are not heroes, or meat for cannon ball, To conquer everyone a man, we have a knack withal, What man could ere resist us, he'd sink beneath his fears, When wesang out our row, tow, tow, We female volunteers. Always let it be your plan To keep clear of a tally man; Avoid your uncle, if you can, From a ginshop bar retreat; If with children you are bless'd, Let them be well fed and dress'd, And don't by creditors be press'd, But try to make ends meet. Above all, with your milkman don't run up a long score, Or you will surely see yourself chalk'd up at your own door. Don't go jaunting in a van, Shun those who have a fancy man, Who smirk and laugh behind a fan, And be a happy wife. \\. hich we did in the days of young Lizzie \u201e{ast.' Barlow.

Now, I've a word or two for you ; don't you interfere with your sweet hearts and wives, but let them do as they please, they're safe to do it in the end, so you may as well make a virtue of necessity and consent at once. Now you let them wear the unmentionables, anybody had better put anything on them than take any thing off when danger threatens the country, or foreign hypocrisy wants to stir up Eng lish firesides with a poker of his own hand ling ; when it comes to that, I say English hearts, be they in paletots or petticoats, ought to put their best foot foremost to drive the invader from the land, and let man, woman, and ohild go in for red coats and rifles. And the neighbours about me all said, The lad winna be more no a country clown, For he's gotten a soft place in his yead ; But father had sent me to school, To see how wi' laming I sped, But schoolmaster said I were naught but a fool, For I'd got a soft place in my yead; Soft place, soft place, I ha' gotten a soft place in my yead, I ha' gotten a soft plaoe in my yead.

Aib, \u2014 *' Very Respectable.'* I'm the right sort of fellow for work, To be idle don't suit my temperament ; I labour and slave like a Turk, I've found it is good, by experiment. Industry it brings riches in, Aud keeps you from poverty's declivity ; To speedily bring in the tin, Why I am the man for activity. Spoken \u2014 I believe you, my boy, I'm the chap for business. I'm all activity, like an indiarubber ball in perpetual motion. Now, some people talk of having too many irons in the fire at once. Pooh ! I say, in with 'em all\u2014 shovel, poker, tongs and all. That's the way I get on. I've got lots of work in- doors, and besides that I attend to plenty out. I often do a friendly turn for the turn- cock, and turn on the for him, with that Daniel Lambert looking latch-key of his. When I'm out early in the morning I exercise my legs, and amuse myself by put- ting my hand to that light business of the lamplighter, while he's upon the fuddle. I often raise the wind at a loan society , though I'm generally unwell, and sometimes I'm too ill to get up a loan (alone). When I've done my day's work, on a summer evening, I enjoy myself at the light, easy recreation of digging in the back garden, and wheeling large barrows of clay up a six-inch plank- Ma/ warms you! I do a little betting upon horse-racing; and nicely I'm often brought to book by my spouse, for making up my book. But I don't mind: I can't be idle, because I'm a man of activity. Chords. And going ahead is my plan, Or I might go down a declivity; I'm known an industrious man, And christened the man of activity. I'm good at presiding in chairs, For the benefit of any society,, .^ And study all people's affairs, Though some do not think that propriety. Time and money I freely invest, To get up a name for urbanity ; By day or by night I don't rest, But look after suffering humanity. SroKEN\u2014 Yes, I'm hon. secretary to the \" Squashybungo Missionary Society,\" ior inducing the male heathen to wear peg-top trousers; collector to the Charitable Insti- tution of Benevolent Buffers, for Providing Canine Animals with Iced Lemonade in the Dog days; treasurer to the Humane Asso- ciation for Teaching Piga' Tails to Grow Straight; with lots of other honorary dis- tinctions, too numerous lo mention. In fact, I don't mind what i do; I'm above nothing, even making myself an animated \" Kamoneur,\" tying a few* hearth-brooms round my head, and sweeping my own chimney on the cheap, by poking my head up and down. I walk along, as they say, as big as bull beef, with nothing too hot or too heavy for me. / can't say, with the song, \u00bb* I've got no work to do.\" Oh, dear, no ! when I rest myself a bit, my chaunt is\u2014 I've lots, of work to do-oooo, Gut lots of work to do oo-oo, From morning light, all noon and night, I've lots of work lo do.

Den we goes ahead to a great hot hell, And hab some wine and de dinner -mell, For Rose am de gal dat likes dat well, . Wid hanging on my arm. (Chorus.) About London Docks she made a fuss, And off we walks in a horribly butt, She was very bad dare, and she got much worse, De wedder was so warm. And she sought to do it fine, She let Blip down too much Dock wine, And she gib a slanting dicular sign, And Kose tumbled off my arm. (Chorus) Den we had a peep at de Lord Mayor's Show, To de ole Thames Funnel down we go below, Den up in a hairy balloon we go, For she was not alarm. Den to Lazy Square, up on de shelf, We see'd de chickens hatch demself, And dat's de way I spend my pelf, Wid my Kosa on my arm. (Chorus.) I should not like to lose a sight, Wedder it's by day or night, And if I does it sarves me right, But dat's my own concern. But dar's nebber a sight dat does please me Like you, good folks, what now I see, And, oh ! how happy I should be \u2014 (Spoken.) \u2014 To be always wid you \u2014 Wid my Eosa on my arm. (Chorus.) EVER TO LIVE DAILY SCHEMING: Aib,\u2014 \" Ever of Thee.\" Ever to live, I am daily scheming, My jovial spirits require good cheer; Can't drink my tea without fresh cream in. And must have the best of all things dear. I, in my heart, good old wine cherish. Everything good on the tick comes to me; Ah ! I fancy I'd much rathor perish, If life's luxuries 1 couldn't see. Morn, noon, and night, awake or asleep. Daily I'm scheming to live on the cheap. Ever to live, scheme, and scheme only, Labouring to live I don't think is well; When hard-up, I feel rather lonely. And think what victim next I can sell. Years have gone by. and yet I flourish, Upon tick, no cash they ever see of me ; And while my corporation I nourish, At fiat's expense, no paying will they see. Morn, noon, or night, awake or asleep, Daily I'm scheming to live on the cheap. Yes, morn, noon, and night, &c. GLEE.-OLD WINTER.

(Written by Thomas Ramsay, and Sung by W. Critchfield at the Canterbury Hall.) Aib, \u2014 \" White Cockade.'* LINES ON AN OLD BOOT. Though a cook\u00abb*p man I'm n one so low, But I some consequence can show ; And fairly prove that 1 now stand As good as any in the land^ As everyone will have their say, The high and low will have their day ; Dispute this argument who can\u2014 lhat a man's a lord, and a lord's but a man? Old boot, you've been a friend to me, But now quite broken you I see ; Tho' you are bad, and bad can be, There's no mending or heeling thee. Thou hast no tout (sole), or thou would'st speak Of days when, being new, you did creak- When your master looked to well and sleek, And got out invited all the week To dine on every luxury. When he had lots of poshery. Tour state I sorry am to gee, But what boots it, to say more of thee. Spoken.\u2014 I can certify, testify, exemplify, and verify my pretensions to greatness criti- cally, circumstantially, figuratively, and posi- tively. Comparatively, a cookshop is a House of Parliament, for there I have many mem- bers ; and these members, as in Parliament, are often bought and sold ; some are roasted, and should be well basted; some are baked, others in a Btew; some are half raw, others over done ; some require high seasoning, some are the better lor stuffing; others re- quire salting; some take a good soaling, and all of them require plenty of sauce; they all require vegetables, and there is mostly something green about them ; some may be swallowed with great pleasure, others are very indigestible, and will stick in your throat do what you will. My pudding's may be compared to a political course; plum pud- ding may be found on both sides ot\" the table, and all over the benches; many cut it fairly, some pick the plums out ; batter puddings in abundance ; light puddings no way scarce. Then in both shop3 there are plenty of cakes \u2014short cakes, pound cakes, and sponge cakes. Soups in abundance and variety, from simple sepits up to luscious turtle; the \u25a0 \u25a0Hire's head and mock are mo3t in request. Many customers in both shops set a long time at table, often are dissatisfied, and fre- quently dispute the bill. But in our shop we never suffer the bill to lie on the table, or allow members to sleep on the benches. If you'll take the pains to look, You'll find the antique oi' cook, Stand forward in the human brood Establish'd long before the flood. By nature's laws each sturdy elf. Could always cook his goose himself; But now we have a law in use To let us cook each other's goose. Spoken\u2014 What are railways compared to a cookshop ? did we not first go ahead in the steaming line long before they gut info hot water ? didn't we use a boiler long before they did with more security and less ex pense? Whoever heard of a cookshop man biinsting his built r? Whoever heard of a railway man who did not tytt his boiler ? what arc their way bills to our falls of Jure? Spoken\u2014 So much for them lines Next, for a few more upon that delectable viand, denominated a savoury, flavoury, gravoury sausage :\u2014 LINES UPON SAUSAGES. Oh, sausage ! how you charm the nose \u2014 Tho' what you're made of, no one knows; \"When in shop windows you disclose Yourself to people bye that goes, There's very few of them suppose, Of what your makers you compose ! You've numerous friends, and many foes, Who say you don't smell like a rose ; Pork butchers, who of you dispose, Don'freat you ; and this much I know, You often do offend my nose ; But, still, so fast my money goes, I'm glad, when my purse empty shows, To eat you, with nice po-ta-toes Signed, Kob, the Rhymer. CHORUS. Shakespeare be bio wed, he never showed, Such nouse as me, at rhyming ; From small things mean, up to the Queen, On all things I keep rhyming.

I'm employed sometimes by the parish officials, To find fathers out who've run off to far towns, Not leaving behind them address or initials, But small pledges of affection, and never half crowns; Up to the Monument I go, then, and ne'er make a failure ; To the end of the world I can nose where they are.

Tidle dol, &c. It seems this lady was unmarried, and very much of men afraid, And I suppose that was the reason that they called her an old maid; Everything was grubby roundher, her garret was a grubby den, Yet she was a woman of some breeding, for she kept a breeding cock and hen. Tidle dol, &c. A troop of grubby cuts grub'd with her, when she'd any grub to spare. And though her room was always grubby, in the cupboard grub was seldom there ; The poor cats got their grub by mousing, but very seldom mice they catch'd, So they caught and eat the young canaries long before the birds were hatch'd. Tidle dol, &c. Her old father was a miser, and a hog- grubber* was by trade, Just such an old grub as Polly, only he was no old maid ; He got his bread upon the water, plying in a grubby boat ; Thus he grub'd on, and on the river kept his wretched life afloat.

Then pledge we the wine cup, and fondly I swore Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note ; As his corse to the ramparts we hurried, Not a soldier discharged his iarewell shot O'er the grave where our hero we buried. We buried him darkly at dead ofnight, The turf with our bayonets turning. By the struggling moonbeams' misty light, And our lanterns dimly burning. Pew and short were the prayers that we \u2022 said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow.' But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead, And we bitterly thought on the morrow. No useless coffin enclosed his breast, Nor iu sheet nor in shroud we bound him; But he lay like-a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him. We thought as we heap'd his narrow bed, And smoothed down his lonely pillow, That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head. And we far away on the billow. Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him; But nothing he'll reck, it they let him sleep on In the grave where a Briton has laid him. But half of our heavy task was clone, When the clock struck the hour for . retiring; And we hoard by the distant and andom f?un, That the foe was suddenly firing. Slowly and sadly we laid him down, From the field of his fame fresh and gory; We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone, But we left him alone in his glory. V 8cc.

But now he's gone aloft. Tom never from his word departed. His virtues were so rare, His friends were many and true hearted, His Poll was kind and fair; And there he'd sing so blythe and jolly. Ah, many's the time and oft ! But mirth is turned to melancholy. For To\u00abn is gone aloft.

OLD ENGLAND SHALL WEATHER THE STORM- Composed by T. Williams. Music at Meteler's. Old England, thy stamina never has yielded To the ills that have menaced abroad and at home ; And while all your energies nobly are wielded, Triumphant you still shall support free- dom's dome. Distress for a moment may dim your bright glory ; But the clouds shall pass over, no cares shall deform. Thy Council and people shall tell the proud story, Old England for ever shall weather the storm. Thy force, single-handed, has long been victorious, The friends of the suffering, the pride of the brave ; Thy struggles, privations, have ever been glorious, The birth-place of liberty, home of the slave ! Yes, yes, there's a spirit within thee pro- claiming.

The noblest captain in the British fleet Might envy William's lips those kisses sweet. \" Oh, Susan : Susan ! lovely dear, My vows shall ever true remain, Let me kiss off that falling tear, We only part to meet again.

OH i ONCE I HAD LOVERS. A favourite Song, from Rory O'More. Oh, once I had lovers in plenty, When a colleen I liv'd in the glen ; I kill'd fifty before I was twenty. Oh, how happy the moments flew then I The winter I ne'er could discover. For Love brighten'd Time's dusky wing\u2014 Oh, when ev'ry new month brought a lover/ The year then seem'd always like Spring, But Cupid's more delicate pinion Could never keep up with old Time- So the grey beard assumes his dominion, When the mid-day of life rings its chime. Then gather, when morning is shining. Some flower while the bright moments last\u2014 Which closely around the heart twining, _' Will live while the summer is past. When thine eye reposes On its ling'ring roses, Once so lov'd by thee, Think of her who wove them. Her who made thee love them, Oh ! then remember me. Adieu, fcc. Oh, who would not welcome that moment's returning. When passion first walk'd a new life through his frame ; And his soul, like the wood that grows pre - clous in burning. Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite- flame! Adieu for awhile, I ne'er forget thee. The land of my fathers, the soil of the free, I sigh for the hour that shall bid me retrace, The pathos my childhood, my own native place. My hearts, &c. When, around thee dying, Autumn leaves are lying, Oh ! then remember me ; And, at night, when gazing On the gay hearth blazing, Oh ! still remember me. Then should music stealing All the soul of seeling. To thy heart appealing, Draw one tear from thee : Then let memory bring thee Strains I us'd to sing thee. Oh ! then remember me. T. Moore. T.

Won her heart right merrily. Yet still she blushed, and, frowning, cried, Na, na, it winna do; I canna, canna, winna, winna, maunni buckle to.

In the history of that little great hero is a beautiful fiction founded on fact, for English courage was the supposed Jack, and oppression the Giant, and rare Jacks our soldiers prove themselves, wherever the Giant Oppression dares to raise his head, they put him to the right-about in double-quick time, and we, the girls of these same Jacks, reward them with our smiles and love, in appreciation of their noble spirit and daring, and we have in some instances been honourably known to share in their perils by flood and field, and what act ef devotion more praise worthy? for we become, ha it were, their ministering angels of comfort, assuaging their pains and wounds, and our words fall uxm their ears sweet as the note of the nightingale.

THE GOOD (t) OLD TIMES, AND THE PRESENT AGE. New Satirico-Comico Contrast. By J. A. Hardwick. Ala\u2014\" Lucy Neal.\" Some praise the \"good old times,\" when our fathers they were young, Of them a deal ot twaddle has been written, said, and sung ; Now, I'll prove far superior are our en- lightened ways. Good-bye to things of George the Third's give me Victoria days. Oh. the good (?) old times\u2014 The precious good old times ! I'll just contrast them with our own, In common sense new rhymes. In the good old times of travelling, it was a snail-pace walk. And took a week of Sundays to go from town to York ; Now, the locomotive whistles superseded the guard's horn. We can lunch at Bath, take tea in Hull, Then supper at Cremorne. Chorus. When George the Third was King, all wicked rogues to warn, They strung felons up, like ropes of onions, on each Monday morn ; Now such good old times are fled, which we don't regret at all, And Jurymen hang back from hanging murderers at all. Chorus. In good old times, at midnight, ifbabby pet was cross, The flint and steel and tinder-box was then the sole resource ; To get alight, you puffed and blowed, till black in the face, And perhaps set fire to your shirt, or burned your dwelling place. Chorus. Such good old times enlightened were with oil lamps, and thick glass. Old frumps with pigtails horrified were at the name of gas ; They swore it was the devil's light, and did with fright perspire, Believing firmly, some night it would set the Thames on Are. Chorus. With the sleepy \"Charlies \" it was half-past two till half-past six. At the sight of a street row the gouty buffers cut their sticks ; A fellow might be murdered on one side of the street. And \" Charlie \" wouldn't interfere\u2014 it wasn't on his beat. Chorus. But look at the contrast now, with the gas and blue poliee, If we do see double, going home, those men who keep the peace, Protect us from pave robbers all, and if for that alone. They do deserve down areas, now and then a mutton bone. Chorus. A fine old institution was the lumbering Hackney Coach, It took two hours from the Strand to Temple Bar approach ; But gone are \" Jar vies.\" and no one does wish to see the.n more. Except old frumps who alwayi growl, \" we want a good hot war.\" Chorus. Cock-fighting, and bull-baiting then, with pugilists like pigs, W ere the classical amusements of British sprigs ; And carrying off watch boxes, with ancient Charlies floored. Were the valourous deeds of fathers of \" bloods \" like Waterford. Chorus. Now for the Hackney Coaches we have Hansom Cabs instead. With cruelty to animals, till horses drop down dead. And for the sporting lords of old, we've noblemen who take Chairs at teetotal meetings, and watery speeches make. Chorus. In the good old times of warfare pressgangs roamed thro' the streets. And seized upon young fellows, to man the British fleet; WHITECHAPEL v. WESTMINSTER. An original Descriptive Comic Song. By J. A. Hardwick. s-.ra 5 Westminster/'Ratcatcher's daughter\" Airs 1 Whiteohapel, \" Dodger's farevell.\" Of London-town and its renown, A deal there has been written, By writers all\u2014 both great and small, From Boz to Bulwer Lytton ; But in a refrain, I mean again The subject just to grapple, And give'em a hit, and show up a bit\u2014 Westminster and Vhitechapel, Too roo loo, rel li do. In Westminster, duke, lord, and sir. Live richly in their club house, For wealthy swells, each of the hotels Is a palatial grub-house; With costly, rare, luxurious fare, They do it all very tidy, And never know what 'tis, like the low. To be jolly hard-up on a Friday. Too roo loo, etc. Vhitechapel, too, can boast of lords\u2014 there lives the Lord-knows-who, And for a daily living all, the Lords knows how they do; Westminster nobs rich pastry tarts and ten- der chickens eat, Vhitechapel pudding is curst-hard, with plenty of fowl (foul) meat. Downey are all Vhitechapel lads, and ditto all their friends, And they don't live, when they can help it, at their own expense, No, not at their own expense. The nobs ecorn swipes\u2014 and wine in pipes, Champagne, hock, port and sherry They order in\u2014 with command of tin, And every day make merry ; Enjoying life, devoid of strife. Quite easy, calm, and pleasant. Such is their aim. and there their game. Is partridge, hare, and pheasant. Too roo loo, etc. Vhitecliapel snobs do pipes as well, Bhort clay ones with a meal, , They have no time for sham pain, they have too much of real ; Altho' to Bwells in living choice, east-enders must knock under. They have their game as well as them, and it is often plunder. Downey are all Vhitechapel lads, etc. West-enders try, and to agents apply, In Parliament to be seated, Westminster's ton all roll along. In cushioned carriage seated . At Tattersall's the sporting swells. Eye blood race-horses knowing, Criticising joints, and age, and points, And the pace they can be going. Too roo loo, etc. Vhitechapel prigs, upon the quiet, oft get into the house, At driving Brick-lane dog-cart turn-outs butcher blades show nous; Good judges, too, of horse-flesh, like swells, they ought to be. They get plenty of it in cheap soups and sausage luxury. Downey are all, etc. The swells of the West, in broadcloth drest, Patronise the Lane and Garden; Without cheque books, and foreign looks, They'd think their life a hard 'un. They go out to dine, and take their wine, With peaches and pine-apple; And make a wry phiz, if they know where it is, At the mention of Vhitechapel. Too roo loo, etc. Whitechapel boys, vith queerish togs, they, too, go to the Lane, They've broils and stews, and they do not to cook themselves disdain; And they dine out round tater cans, at all hours of the clock. And if they've not the fruit, they do pine- apple rum and rock. Downey are all, etc, The nobs to amuse\u2014 new sights and views, The West-end's always full of; From gents, to the Queen\u2014 all the rich and green, Exhibitors get the pull of. In fact, the swells and west-end belles, As well as possessing treasure, Very speedy would, if they only could, Monopolize every pleasure. Too roo loo, etc. But, on Saturday night, from Osmond St., to far past Mile End gate, Vhitechapel lads amusements have, that would quite stun the great ; Cheap Jacks, quack doctors, mountebanks, all bawling themselves in tits ; So, Westminster, don't chuckle, for Vhite- chapel's with you quits. But now, if with such gangs they did our liberty assail, And sent out a press, the British Press would soon make rulers quail. Chorus. Old antiquated buffers may mourn for the good old times, But never mind, old gentlemen, we've still their tricks aud crimes ,\u25a0 With gross election bribery, about which we've lately heard. Proves corruption's just uK'rampant as in the days of George the Third. Chorus. Let those who'd pit the good old times against this age of steam. Doze over their \"churchwarden pipes,\" indulging in a dream; The reign of Queen Victoria tends all pre- judice to smother, If we do conquer one half the world, and bully well the other. Oh, the good old times, The precious good old times ; I have contrasted with our own, In common-sense new rhymes. BEAUTIFUL GIBLS. New Comic, by J. P. Alford. Adapted to an old Chaunt, and sung by W- Hatton, G. Hudsfield, sc, &c. Now boys I pray get out ot the way, And gentlemen take the road, If ever I saw such a sight before, No, if I did may I be Mowed. Make way for the petticoats, 1 say. With their bonnets half down their backs, It strikes me someday, for our ladies so gay, We shall soon have to pay a Hue tax. Chorus. Beautiful girls, charming young girls, Push along, dash along crinoline girls. All through the streets iu hoops how they whirls, Beautiful lound-about crinoline girls. Believe you may, what I'm going to say, . And what I have just sajd, To show high heel buots, the dress up they loops, And thus exhibit their petticoats red, In this queer style of fashion now proudly they dash on, The streets seem all in a flutter. By day or night the men are pushed out right Slap into the dirty gutter. Chorus. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, it makes me feel queer To see how the money goes, For hoop-te doo-dum-doos, it gives me the blues To pay for such ridiculous clothes. If you take a trip out, and keep your eyes about, I'm sure it would make you all smile. To see the ladies fair it's a lark I declare. Trying to get over a style. Chorus. If you go to a ball it's the best game of all, As sure as eggs are eggs, I believe the invention was the sole intention To show off the ladies fine legs. You should only go to the grand casino, And there you'd have a fine treat, To see the little dears as they nightly appears Kicking up their militaire feet. Chorus. There's my wife I declare, and two daughters fair, Now they've got me into a line, 'Twas only last night, and I don't think it right. They coaxed me to buy them crinoline, And yet I don't mind while the browns I can find, For they've all got such winning ways, God bless the ladies all, both great and small, In spite of the fashion of these days.

Hardwick. \" Chaunt.\" Now eighteen hundred and fifty-nine's nigh (quite) gone, And eighteen hundred and sixty nearly (fully) born, I'll sing of some things that made people forlorn, For vanishing (vanished) fifty-nine caused many to mourn. Chorus, Air\u2014\" Monument and St. Paul's.\" Old Father Time's occurrences, Made many people pine ; Here's some reminiscences Of eighteen fifty-nine. With strikes, the \" lock out,\" and men walking about, It was a time of adversity, gloom and doubt ; Things looked very queer, and togs went up the spout. And labour many a man had to go wi.hout. Old Father Time's, etc. We'd some pretty revelations of bribery tricks, At elections of M.P.'s., who treated like bricks; Which on some in high life odium must fix, Who found free electors wculd'nt vote for nix. Old Father Time's etc. A reform bill the Derbyites wished to cram Down our throats, that was nothing but a regular sham ; But the people wouldn't put up with any such flam, And again in power sent the jaunty Lord Pam. Old Father Time's, etc. It caused an excitement, the Smethurst poisoning trial, And filling people's minds, and the papers for awhile I At the Solons of juryman many persons did smile, To find saved his neck had that man of guile. Old Father Time's, etc. Louis Napoleon to victory his legions did lead. And made despot Austria pretty freely to bleed ; But of liberty at all he took little heed, Italy wasn't, and isn't likely yet to be freed. Old Father 'lime's, etc. Pigtail John Chinaman, of treachery ever full. In a cowardly manner managed to best John Bull; But the flowers of the flowery land won't get tiie pull, Says John, \"I'll have revenge, I'm blow'd, but I wull.\" Old Father Time's, etc. The relics of Franklin and his lost crew were found. And their settled fate made many sad around ; The \"Royal Charter,\" in a terrible storm got aground, And nearly five hundred fellow creatures were drowned. Old Father Time's, etc. The treaties at Zurich took a long while to settle. Offish the poor old Pope he made a pretty kettle; \" Big Ben,' ' number two, got a crack in his metal, And Champion Tommy Sayers polished on Bob Brettle. Old Father Time's, etc. Rifle clubs playing at soldiers were the order of the day. The \"Great Eastern\" contrived to get on a little way ; Garibaldi with the Austrians the devil did play. And the cat-o'-nine-tails our soldiers' did flay. Old Father Time's, etc. Then Spain at the Moors in Morocco let fly, And the niggers for freedom had a little shy; The Yankees got up a San Juan difficulty, And Naples Bomba, at last consented to die. Old Father Time's, etc. The French indicators, lit up ofa night, Did the horses of noble patricians affright, So the Duke of Wellington continued to write, But the papers politely told him to take a\u2014 light. Old Father Time's, etc. They filled the town with drinking foun- tains a crop, In the vain hope of all future jollity to stop; And make the over-taxed publicans shut up their shop, But all pickles, for where is the harm in a drop? Old Father Time's, etc. Now, I've told you a few things about eighteen fifty-nine, And for its disasters and troubles we don't mean to pine; As long as we know we're supreme on the brine A fig for care.

There is a new work that comes out Once a week, that's called \"All the year ronnd ;\" I wont speak of that, but about All the year round, as I have it found. With most people the year goes around Pretty much in the very same way ; The poor daily go to the ground, And the rich daily do it up gay. Move along, rail along, steam, In all c'.-asses troubles abound; And people are all on the scheme, To 'get along, all the year round. The doctors send potions, and pills, To rich people, ailing, each day, And'draw out immensely long bills. For fathers of families to pay. Advertising and puffing's the rage, And knaves, and quack doctors abound. In fact, in this drive-along age, It's puffery \" All the year round. Chorus.

An original Parody on \"Beautiful Star.\" Written expressly for Mrs. W. Barnett, by J. P. Alford. LUCK IS COMING TO US MARY. New Comic Sketch by A Hardwick. Air\u2014 \" We are coming Sis.\" Beautiful Pa in liquor so tight, Slowly staggering home each night, When you're leaving the gin shop bar, Then I am dreaming Beautiful Pa. Chorus. Fine Old Pa you look divine, On a very gloomy Friday, When the rent we could not get, We heard a band of music, Playing in the gutter wet. We was hard up, with no dinner, But I felt my spirits rise, As the band played 'neath our window, And 1 to my Mary cries \u2014 Luck is coming to us, Mary Luck is coming, bye and bye, Keep your pecker up, my Mary, For good luck is coming nigh. I tried to cheer up Mary, When you've had your dose of wine. Oft I'm wondering where you are. Pa every evening, Beautiful Pa. Chorus. With Nancy Sly you are so gay, Nice old games with her you play. At the Grecian before the bar. Star of the City Road, Beautiful Pa. Chorus. Beautiful Pa you know its not right. Waltzing with the girls all night. Pet of the petticoats Dad you are. Star of the Eagle, good natured Pa Chorus. Spoken.\u2014 We will leave Mrs. E. below in the care of the Stewardess, and join Mr. R. and his nephew Billy, who on seeing the Tower of London (for that vos the exact distance and extent of Mr. R's. naviga tion) when poor uncle's coat received a severe pull at one of she tails to the im minent peril of a dissolution in partnership. I say uncle, vot is that square building over there? that. Bill (for Mr. IJ. was willing to impart to his nephew all he possibly could, and when master Bill required me of course he was told not to be so inquisitive ) Veil Billy that's the Tower. Vot do they do there uncle? Do, nothing, but they used to put prisoners in it. Oh, uncle\u2014 looking earnestly in his uncle's face\u2014 vos that vere the bobbys took you the other night? Be quiet sir (fortunately the latter question was not overheard;) another twitch,\u2014 Vots them in the vater? Them's buoys. Are they bathing uncle? Yes, floating. By this time Mrs. ft. had arrived, feeling considerably better from the care ol the stewardess and some thing from the steward. She felt (on en quiry) pretty cenfortabie. Another twitch at uncle Bill's coat. Vot's they big chimleys in that ship? (this was the Great Eastern they were passing) They's funnels Bill. Funnels uncle? them's larger than the von Mr. Vood do use to put the gin into aunt's bottle? Be quiet sir. Vot's that coming out of the top of 'em uncle? That's steam Billy. Vot's steam uncle? Now Mr. R. was puzzled completely. Steam, Billy ; veil yer sees a round thing at the bottom of the long chim bley; veil, under that's a boiler. A boiler, uncle? Is it like the boiler aunt do use to boil the bacon and cabbage in ? The idea of cabbage being mentioned to a tailor, and surrounded by several persons was to much for Mr. R. A swinging box in the ear sent master Bill into aunt Jemima's lap, who declared Mr. E. was a brute. After rubbing his ear a little he asked his aunt what steam was, which Mrs. R. could as easily answer as who built Rome, he must go to his uncle,\u2014 another twitch at uncle's coat. Oh uncle, you didn't tell me vot steam vos. Veil, in that boiler they pours vater: at the end of the boiler there's a fire which makes the vater boil; and the smoke you sees coming out of the top is the steam, the same as you see coming out of the tea kettle. But vot makes the ship to go uncle ? Vy steam to be sure. Oh crickey, cries Bill. Mr. R. considered his elucidation of steam as clear as that from a Brunei, or a Stephen sou. A sudden shower coming on, aunt, Jemima's straw-coloured ribbon on her bon net being wet, hung down like snowdrops, the wind having changed, the smuts from the funnel being blown on the top ofthe wet trimmings of Airs. R 's bonnet, considerably improved it. At last they arrived; they saw the pier, the gardens, and all the lions. On seeking master Bill to return, he was missing. Aunt Jemima was in hysterics, and nothing but the powerful efforts of three waiters, aud four glasses of brandy brought her too, a decided attack of hic cups attending the recovery. At last he was found, On enquiries as to where he had beeu, of course here, there, and every where. Once more on board the steamer master Bill fell asleep. Aunt Jemima wouldn't drink out of uncle's glass, no, it And I said I knew a day Was very quietly coming, When ill-luck would fly away. As I spoke I heard a shuffling Of the feet, outside our door; ' Twas the landlord, who was bawling, For the rent due three pounds four. SroKEi*.\u2014 Then Polly began to snivel, but I said to her\u2014 Wid his dashin and his slashin, &c.

And just as I spoke to Mary, An old uncle, just from sea, Come home, with lots of money. And had come to call on me. Fortune smiled and we were jolly. For he lent me fifty pounds, Arid now we're never melancholy, Since we've turned ourselves around. Spoken \u2014 And whenever things look queer, I never fret, but say to my Polly- Luck is coming to us, Mary, Luck ia coming by and bye, Keep your pecker up, my Mary, For good luck is drawing nigh. My lodging is in Leather Lane, A parlour that's next to the Bky ; 'Tis expos'd to the wind and the rain, But the rain and the wind I defy.

But Sam was a slick hand a gunning, I guess he was too. He once shot a flash oflightning wid dat gun ; well, de flash fell into de fibber, and set fire to it; and all de fish dat was kotch'd in dat ribber after before dat, was always ready cooked. Anoder time it shot a gale of wind, and there wasn't breath to wag a windmill, and de water-mills wouldn't work, case dey didn't pay wind taxes. But at last dis gun went off, and it reach so far dat it never corned back again ; but de most disprising ting ob it is, dat it went off widout being fired, dat was in quinciquence of somebody taking it away, so it was carried furder den eber it could carry itself\u2014 as I guess. THE REAL BITTER CUP. ON A MAY-DAY MORNING EARLY. An original Comic song. By J. A. Hardwick. Sung by Mr. W. J. Adams. To the fields I carried my milking can, On a May-day morning early, And there I met with a smart young man, W ho said that he loved me dearly. I made him a curtsey, he made me a bow, He kissed me and promised to marry, I vow. Oh I wish that young fellow was with me just now, On a May-day morning early I I try to forget him, but all in vain. On a May-day morning early ; And if I should never see him again. It will break my heart \u2014 or nearly. I can't bear the sight of a sheep or a co#, I want to be married and can't tell how. Oh 1 I wish that young fellow was with m\u00ab just now, On a May-day morning early ! Air:\u2014\" Paddy's Museum.\" In the doctors' shops round the metropolis, A goblet you 6ee standing up, Made of wood, and they tell to the populace That it is the new \" Bitter Cup.\" Two shillings the charge, if you buy it, And some think the price is but small. But the real bitter cup, if you try it, I'll tell you, that costs nothing at all. Chorus- To be minus of friendship and money, Quite down in the world and hard up, And drink to the dregs of misfortune. Why, that is the real bitter cup. Wid his dashin and his slashin, &c. ONCE IN A WAY. There's magy poor Jobs in this nation, Who have not his patience at all, Thro' ill-luck aud stand-still stagnation Of trade, are oft sent to the wall.

In the ranks of death you'll find him ; His father's sword he has girded on, And his wild harp slung behind him. \"Land of Song !\" said the warrior-bard, \" Though all the world betrays thee, One sword, at least, thy rights shall guar One faithful harp shall praise thee.\" The minstrel fell ! but the foeman's chain Could not bring his proud soul under ; The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again, for he tore its chords asunder; And said, \" No chains shall sully thee, Thou soul of love and bravery I Thy songs were made for the pure and free They shall never sound in slavery.\" We've plenty of bitters to swallow, Without buying doctors' at all. Misfortunes so fast some men follow, Neither sparing the great or the small. 'Tis bitter to go without dinner, And bitter of sorrow to sup, And bitter to daily grow thinner, Without any other bitter cup. C/torus.

Her suushine of life turned to sorrow and gloom. For she who received him, her heart beating filadly, Found her sweet cup of bliss with gall run- ning o'er; He, in return, used her cruelly, sadly. How could she love such a villanous bore? Every tie of affection all decency scorning, Sourning her wantonly worse than a Turk ; Flushed with the drink, rolling home in the morning, No money, no food\u2014 yet refusing to work. Stripping her home to replenish the bottle, The mattrass has gone where the bed went before. For liquor to moisten his unmanly throttle, How could she love such a villanous bore? He would have led her to shame and dis- honour, Doing his best with starvation and gin, To bring down the scorn of the cold world upon her; But vainly he strove\u2014 she resisted the sin. Then kick followed blow till her senses were reeling. Thus body and mind both alike making sore, Trampling on every womanly feeling. How could she love such a villanous bore? But why did she leave him to mate with another? Breaking the links of the pure marriagevow. She had no father, no kindred, no brother ; He will be all to her withered heart now. And where is her husband ? in yonder gin palace ; There, bloated and drunk, on the sawdusted floor, ile is gnawing his fingers and feeding his malice, Because she has left him, the villanous bore.

Then Patrick's made of butter, because that he a Pat is, And Mathew's is good for doorways, because that he a Mat is ; Nieodemas must be wicked, if aged, lie's old Nickey, And Richard's got no shirt, with him its only Dickey. Johns they must be fishes, for why, they all Jacks are. And many Scotchmen Whiskey, because we know they Max are (Macs) ; Moses and Abraham, Aaron, too, all are called by Moey, And Joseph is a groat, because he is a Joey.

Item, that the husband be always in work and the wife never out of money ; that our crinolines and bonnets are always to be kept out of our husband's mouths, and our hands always in their ptickets ; that we control and yet be un confroled ; that she command and yet be uncomm&fided ; that she be mistress of our private funds and chancellor of the ex chequer ; that they nek our permission to go out, and without our permission not to stay at home ; that he never be out of the way when wanted, and never in the way when not wanted ; to fetch, to carr>', to hear, see, and say nothing ; that with ser vant maids they be made not to meddle ; that he rind ways and means, but yet have no mean ways : this is our time, these are our terms, strike, strike, for emancipation.

Half ragged, hungry wretches, with scarce a place to dwell, Get moved, if they attempt on the pathway to sell ; While advertising humbugs and fortune- telling gents. Get more pounds than poor costermongers do pence. Ah, it's all moving, move, keep moving, Where are poor people to get a livelihood ? But it's not all moving, not all quite moving. Crinoline and perambulators so block up the way. That to move along at all is difficult to do \u2014 You might as well try safe Chancery to get through, As try to move with freedom along a po- pulous street.

But to return to the kitcken'lifte of a policeman, wliafcan be more delicious or more enticing.

I'm the chap to wake 'em up, there's no non sense about me ; I does my duty, and I does it in my own way I should just like to catch a fellow taking my number, or threatening to report me, my eye ! it wouldn't be good tor his health ; I don't carry this for nothing (showing his truncheon), Ishculdthink not, it's the finest thing in the world to bring a man to his senses, or knock him out of 'em; but lor' bless you, when I first became a policeman I was as green as grass when they put me on night duty, I actually used to walk- about looking after other people's welfare and for getting my own ; but 1 didn't do it long, I can tell you, \"Live and let live\" is my motto. Why its my firm belief, that if we were to take into custody every gentleman of the bar (crowbar I mean) that we drop across, our occupation, like Othello's, would be gone \u2014 done up ; oh, no, it would never do! Now, this is my style of doing business; picture to yourselves an old drunken swell staggering home at 2 o'clock in the morning, hardly knowing whether he stands on his heels or his head, what d'ye think I do with him\u2014 why I'll tell you\u2014 I first look about cautiously to make sure we're alone, and I then commence doing my duty by (in the first place) watching his pocket, and then pocketing his watch ; 1 then, unfasten his neckcloth for fear the old buffer might choke, and strange to say \\vhen unpinning his collar. I generally manage to collar his fin, and that's what I cull gaining a point, then go over his pockets in search of his card, and if I discover one I lookout for a cab and bundle him home, and by so doing, I consider I remove temptation from the path of some poor wretch who might be induced through poverty to plunder the person of a fellow ci eature. \" Chau.tt.\" YE LEGENDE OF OLD BOOTY OF \u2022nTc-crn-Dcr-AT-F c-tux-ut UIb_UU.rblxaiii bltv.__U.j__r* For oh, horror of horrors ! when he thuew a light on the slaughter, Hefoundhe'd Grewiucred hisonlyyaiug For I'm the chap to wake 'em up, None do the thing genteeler, And right throughout the blessed force, I'm called the Model Feeler.

How pleasantly, how merrily, my time away I pass, I never think of trouble while of grog I've got a glass ; I care not what the liquors be, if brandy gin, or rum, My taste is far from dainty, so I take 'em as they come. And this advice I give to all who would their sorrows drown. Just try and keep your spirits up by pouring spirits down; And always, too, if possible, imbibe your liquors neat. For who wouldn't be a lushington? it's such a jolly treat ! Who wouldn't be a lushington? it's suoh a jolly treat !

My second is a charming bride, We gaily float along the tide Of life, and care for nousht beside, Do me or Mrs. Johnson. I say, spanker, give my respects to the sun; I'm in love and I fain would get married, But the lovely girl has told me flat, That in my love suit I've miscarried, She's a lady who cannot bear fat. If my size and my weight to be having, I am sure I would not care a pin, If half of my time I was starving, If by it I could get thin. Should'nt 1 like to get thin, &c.

The policeman swore boldly, the gent broke his crown, And the magistrate coldly upon him did frown.

U stands for the union, and may you all be blest What should you do, girls, if a faithless lover And suffer no uneasiness, unquiet, or unrest, V for Victor, don't wed him, he'll victor be o'er you, And if you have a Valentine, be sure it's good and true. You should discover a wild rover quite? What, pine in sorrow? \u2014 oh, no, to-morrow Get another one, and just serve him right. Tho' on his knees himself he's throwing, Let him be knowing it will not do, For your hand that he may whistle, Give him dismissal, that's what you do.

So, then, it's but a trifle, if you've duns in in your career, Believe that your good fortune to-morrow will appear ; But hunting money is no trifle, and all needy Eaglishmen Are fierce as hungry tigers when they're fundless now and then.

On a land cruise over London. Prize-money all had got galore,\u2014 They'd just been paid off at the Nore, And bent upon a spree ashore, Up to Blackwall by rail they bore. * , Arrived in town, they all begun Suggesting various sorts of fun, Till the blue jackets every one, Voted on a spree through London. When Jack's ashore, he's all alive, Aud to the duece himself would drive; To spend his gold he does contrive In no time over London. With cans ot grog and valour fired, To drive a turn-out they aspired ; If they could, the Lord Mayor's coach they'd hired. To take a cruise through London.

Who looked as though they'd had a feed. At a draper's and a florist's shop, These jovial Jack tars made a stop, To buy ribbons and flowers to sport a'top. Of their four-wheel ship through London.

Then out at the door she went again, And --he turn'd up her nose at the sots ; And she walked tip toe across the street, Where her true love was crying' pots ; ' So she cried aloud, \" O I you love me not, I know it, you naughty man ; My love you scorn'd for the fat old cook, Who gave you nice sops in the pan.\" But he quick replied, \"My charming dear, I pr'ythee, love, listen to me, k For in truth I have got but one true love, And Suckey, dear, you are she. For oh ! the cook, with sops in the pan, My constancy tried to prove ; But ah ! when I gobbled the dainty bits, 1 thought on my only love,\" Then she gave him a kiss, and they made it up, While her tongue went clickity clack ; And when they had got to the end of the street, They turn'd them, and then\u2014 they went back.

As I popped down the lid. 4 Then down came missus, and said she, ' We wash to-morrow morn\u2014 You'd better light the copper fire, And make the water warm.'

ON THE GRAND. THE IRISH CURE. Written by Thomas Kamsay. Aie.\u2014 The Strand, They call me Katty Conner, A laughing girl am I, But to get an honest living, Through Dublin streets I cry, The fruits of all the seasons round, Weather hot or cold, By the merry Irish cure, Are daily bought and sold. But I cannot tell why, I'm sure, They call me the Irish cure, But the gents wink and grin, Touch me under the chin, And call me the Irish cure. Well, like a stuck pig there I stood, I'd not a word to say, Bnt my Master paid my wages, And I leit that very day ? If any here a servant want, Of the place I should be proud, But mind it must be one of those There is a swell that walks the Strand, Cutting it fat upon the grand, On the grand, on the grand, on the grand, on Hie grand. Instead of socks he sported gaiters, His crabshells, a pair of snobs translaters, On the grand, on the grand, on the grand, on the grand. Chokus. Such a swell was Swagger, heigh 0 1 * A man about town, To every dodge down. Such a swell was Swagger. Where followers are allowed. THE YODNG MAN BRED A CARPENTIER. I deal in garden stuff and fruit, With fish I spend my hours. Such as rabbits, chickens, eggs and roots, Crabs and cauliflowers, No matter what the seasons are, I've something worth their buying, And tho' I'm laughing near and far, For other folk's good I'm crying, But I cannot tell why, I'm sure, They call me an Irish cure, But the gents wink and grin, . Touch me under the chin, And call me an Irish Cure. My love he is a sailor-boy, gallant and bold, He's as tall as a flag-staff, scarcely nineteen years old, For to cruise around this wide world, he has left his own dear, And my heart it is a busting because he's not here. At half a sight you soon might tell, He was a made up seedy swell, On the grand, &c. His pegtop pants, the worse for wear, With a clober'd coat worn quite threadbare, On the grand, etc. \u2014 Chorus. Chords. Around his neck he sports a quizzing glass, With a duffer ofa watch, a chain ofbrass, On the grand, etc. But the brass in his purseis a different case, Instead of wearing there, he has brass in his face, On the grand, etc.\u2014 Chorus. For bis spirit was tremendous, And fierce to behold. In a voung man bred a carpentier, Only nineteen years old. I really sank while he got hot, When a thought came in my head\u2014 And down the garden missus ran, To see which of her fowls was dead She took the candle in her hand, And by its flickering glimmer, Up the area steps Joe bolted. Just as he began to simmer. There's Barney Lary courted me A twelvemonth and a day, But he never once supported me, For all his work was play; He spent the wages he'd not got, And so badly was behaving. His brass and coppers went to pot, He at the pot-house spent his saving. Why he'd call me an Irish cure. I never could tell I am sure, But the gents with a grin, Chuck me under the chin. Crying, there's a sweet Irish cure. His parients they bounded him for to be a carpentier, But a seafaring life he did very muoh prefer ; For his spirit was tremendous, and fearful to behold, In a young man bred a carpentier, only nineteen years old. For his spirit, &c. He sports for his dinner and does it flash, Two of soup, and a pen'orth of smash, On the grand, etc. For his dossing he never blews a souce, His bed is on the bench ofa coffee-house.

My buzzum it is tossing just like the rolling sea, For fear that his affections don't still point to me ; For a sweetheart can be found in any port, I am told, Especially for a a young man only nineteen years old. For his spirit, &c.

Hath affection lost all power ? Wilt consign me to the tomb ? I'm thy sister ; dost thou love me? I'm dying ; will that move thee ? From the hands of thee, my brother, Must I meet this dreadful doom?

I called for a naggin of the old ding dong, Just to give a polish to the song ; I paid for the same frank and lree, And the first toothful I gave was to Biddy Magee. Och, me darlint Norah Lee, etc. I gave her a chuck under the chin, *ly blarney tale I did begin ; To be my wife she did agree, So condescending was Biddy Magee. When I danced wid her a jig, at the fair, or the wake, So sweetly smiled my little Colleen Bawn, I felt so elated, every boy's skull I could break. And drink whiskey, and fight till the morn. Och, swate young Norah Lee, shure wont ye marry me? If ye dcn't I'll a widow die, forlorn ; I'm draining wide awake, when at labour, or at play, Ye writhing little Colleen Bawn. Och, swate young Norah Lee, etc. Oh, you fast young men, Wild, fa3t you.,g men, To settle down as steady boys There is not one in ten. Then, my boys, a week after that, Biddy she married her darling Pat; The boys I invited to join in the spree, Of the weddin' of Pat and Biddy Magee. They're fast at calling us d neks and doves And all that kind of thing; But fast they take themselves all off, When we hint about the ring. They're fast enough at swearing, Without us they would be dead ; In fact, they're fast at everything, Except fast getting wed. Wild, wicked, fast young men, &c. But sergeant, is it fitting only privates' backs to play, Why not commission'd scoundrels feel the cat as well as they ? So we maybe by them strung up, and cut and slash'd like dogs, May palsy seize the dastard arm that next a soldier flogs. When duty calls we'll freely bleed for England's church and throne, That pious rogues may sleep secure, and lordlings hold their own, Down with the degradation we are army slaves till then. And our ranks are formed of anything but spirited young men. There wastall Maguireand DinnyO'Moore, Phaley and Tim to welt attheflure; M'Gorman, the fidler, who never could see. He came to squint at Biddy Magee. The whiskey went round in quarts galore, Those who were knocked up tell on the flure,- Thin Phaley and Tim, to kick up a spree. Swore by dad, they'd have the first kiss from Biddy Magee. The fast young gents, in search of gold, To the \"diggings\" fast off go; So fast, there'll be none left at, all, Then what will maidens do? I feel a hero bould, when I think of Norah Lee, An' could fight a thousand spalpeens for her sake ; Take prisoners a million of a Chinese enemy. Or the stronghold of Belzeebub I'd tak e. Och, me lovely Norah Lee, take pity upon me. Or I'll die a foot a day, till I'm go\u00bbe ; But I know ye'll marry Pat, who loves ye, night and day. Me darlint little swate Colleen Bawn. But why, fast to Australia, To rock cradles do they steer ? When they've a chance to stay at home, And rock the cradle here. I bate the divils that very night, And put the company all to flight ?

Oh, Bold Robin Hood was a forester good, So I've read, but lie did not act qtute as he j should, For his deer meat he got very cheap in tlie wood. A banished outlaw was bold Kobin, A rare chap was bold Robin Hood. Some say ho was Earl oi Huntingdonshire, And run thro' his property like a wikt squirts, 'J hen he took to the road, lor what he did require ; 1 inct that be daily was robbing ('lubin) All travellers thro' merry Sherwood. To tell his real histoi'y. I'll just have a try, How he liv'd, how he plundered, aud hu\\v he did die. And how he King Richard's whole troop did defy, While roaming the green woods was Robin, That famous outlaw, Robin Hood. Air.\u2014 '* Rosin, the Beau.\" \u25a0 With a hundred bold foresters, Robin Resided iu merrie Sherwood; 'they did'nt pay much lor their lodgings. And to seize on them there was no goo Is, All the sticks the hold outlaws could show, Was their quarter staves, all in a row j If the men they deshed to go shooting. They could all ot them draw the long bow. (1st air resumed.) He robbed from rich, to give unto the puori The kings, and great nobles fat deer he'd secure, And my first Christmas were to be sioue secure, Who came in the way of bold R obiu There were none could withstand Rubin Hood. lie met with a maid, and love to her made. Maid Marion, she made no objection, it's seen, And they jumped the broom, beneath a green glade, A deuce of a fellow was Kobin, Loved the lasses, did bold Robin Hood. He so lov^d the church, that he robbed all the priors, Fleeced the monks of their gold, did the same with the friars, And made no distinction, that being, with the squire, But cleared them quite out, did rare Robin, A real dodger was bold Robin Hood. From a bishop, who travelled upon the high- way, Four hundred gold marks his men took away. Then his reverend kept in the forest, to prr.y While feasted his men and brave Kobin And made him sing psalms, Rubin Hood. Three squires, he heard, were to swing on a tree. But \"no,\" said stout Robin, that never shall be, For me and my archers will soon set them free, Come, rally, my men around Robin, The captain of merrie Sherwood. At last, Robin Rood, he fell down on his luck, His fellows fled, for they had little \\ luck ; tt hen his fortune was up, all tight to him stuck, But stepped off when done up was Robin, And hard up waa bold Kobm Hood. In the dumps, with not a dump,, in the green wood, He pondered and thought, as downcast he stood, That, if he was bled, feel better he should, So after a leech went bold Robin, No \"Mappin's razor\" had poor Robin Hood. To n friar to bleed him bold Robin applied, \\\\ ho speedy the lancet stuck into his side, And bled him so much, that he bled till he died. So turned up his toes did great Robin, Thus perished renowned Robin Hood, And little John buried bold Robin, In the sorest of merrie Sherwood, A SOLDIER MUST FOR EVER WAE BE WAG1ST&. SCF.KA.

Bardwick, Air\u2014\" Young man from the Country.\" When first I came to London, a walk about I took, There was the Monument, St. Pauls, and the Horse Guards at to look ; We all have our misfortunes, and I met with two or three, For when I came from the country, a young girl kept following me, When I came from the country, a young girl kept following me. The first time she accosted me, I bravely stood ray ground, Next moment, my new overcoat ripped up behind I found ; And yet she did not move a peg, but cried, unblushingly, \" This young man from the country has took liberties with me. That young chap from the country he took liberties with me.\" \"When up I spoke, the mob around, kept hustling me about, The prigs that day were busy, and my pockets were cleaned out, My silver watch was stolen, and she bawled to policeman C, \" This young man from the country has took liberties with me. This vile wretch from the country, he took liberties with me.\" I tried, in vain, to tell the truth, how often I can't say ; But things kept flying at my head, in quite an unlawful way ; To Bow-street up they took me, where so wickedly swore she, \"That young man from the country, Sirs, took liberties with me. Oh! Sirs, that wicked countryman took liberties with me.\" She, and a nice policeman, false evidence did give. Bobby swore he knew in London.by roguery I did live ; I was sent to the Old Bailey, where she vowed wrongfully, *' That's the young man from the country, as took liberties with me. That young swell from the country, he took liberties with me.\" And they who stole my watch and pin, yes, they my purse who took, The judge believed that morning, and at me his head he shook ; Me, a Joseph in morality ! to think falsely swore she, \"That young man from the country took liberties with me. That's the fellow from the country, as -took liberties with me.\" Somehow, I got acquitted, hut a lecture me they gave, To unproiected females in future to behave. Young fellows, all take warning, when girls Jollow in your lee, \u00bb Lest they should treat you, as, when from the country, that girl treated me. When I came from the country, that kept following of me. Now the girls they ogle me, When I'm going on the spree, But as to what they say, why, I dons care a sprat, But the boys do me annoy, With there goes another guy, Or did your mother put you in that pork pie hat. Or did your, &c. Now one day when up in town, The rain it pelted down, I managed to get home, but like a half- drowned rat, You may think it is all bosh, But my wife did three week's wash, With the water I brought home on my pork pie hat. With the water, &c. Now as I lay asleep one night, I was woke up in affright, For I heard a devilish molrowing hy the cat, Nex,t morn when I came down, To my great surprise I found, That the cat had seven kittens in my pork pie hat. That the cat, &c. One night while making merry, My missus broke thej \u2014 -y, A serious domes*;c calamity was that, But when w^ went to bed, I put something there instead. For I made a\u2014 wash-hand-bason\u2014 of my pork pie hat. For I made a\u2014 necessary\u2014 of my pork pie hat. So now I'll end my song. For fear of making it too long. And I hope no one's oifended at my singing about that, If you think you have a cause, To grant me your applause, I shall take it as a feather in my pork pie hat. I shall take it as, fcc. THE.

Ri tiddy sol lol, etc. Well, I went out one night along with two more palls, We laughed and jok'd. and chaffed, and played the devil with the gals, While I was out I spied one, ys fair as any queen. Says she, \" How nice he looks in his suit of velveteen.\" Ri tiddy sol lol, etc. I walked along with her, I talked of chick- ens and of coops, And then our conversation turned upon the ladies' hoops, On hoop ile-clooden-doo or what some folks call ciinoline ; But you'll find its not so bad as a suit of velveteen. Ri tiddy sol lol, etc. Now a bobby passing by she gave me in his charge, While I like any other chap strove hard to get at large. \" What has he done,\" said he \" Why, he's smash'd my crinoline,\" And then he iked me off with my suit of vel- vet e e n . Ki tiddy sol lol. etc. Now nine months after this, I regretted what I did. For she came to my house, and shows to me a kid, \" D'ye see this kid,\" says she, says I \" What do you mean,\" Say she \" this kid was born in a suit of vel- veteen.\" Ri tiddy sol lol, etc_ Next morn, oh what a mess, I was drawn before the beak. Through that I had to pay, a hals-a-crown a week, They said it was like me, its like they'd never seen. More so because 'twas drest, in a suit of vel- veteen. Ri tiddy sol lol, etc. Now to get rid of this suit, I put it up the spout, I gave that cove the ticket so he went and got it out, So now if he goes out, and in that suit is seen, He'll rue the day lie wore, a suit of velve- teen.

For night after night by the gin palace door, I've watched and I've iound her dead drunk on the floor. Of brandy and water she'll just do her whack, For she'll swig a horse-bucket full ofT in a crack ; She drinks ale and stout till she's quite half- and half, And then she comes home with a devilish laugh ; She breaks all the glasses, the tables and chairs, I wonder she don't break her neck down the stairs, If that were to happen what joy it would be, I wish that the devil would take her from me.

They say that the \" Voyage is long, that the road is rough and thorny.\" But hope every step attends, a holy zeal and passion fires her, With strength and courage faith inspires her, and charity assistance lends. As she wanders, oft she ponders, on her mother, lov'd so well, Far away, where angels dwell ; Scarce she grieves, for she believes, soon she'll be where angels dwell. One night, faint from hunger and fear, sue sinks on a plain, cold and arid, A kind shepherd, wandering near, the child to a convent carried. The sisters to her aid then fly ; too late ! she sleeps to waken never. And death that two fond hearts could sever, reuniteth them on high, Heaven hath called her near her mother, near that mother, loved so well. Far away, where angels dwell. Orphan blest!-Oh, calm thou'lt rest! far away, where angels dwell- (Spoken).
