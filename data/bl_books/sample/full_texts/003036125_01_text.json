Peggy. Yet, 'tis a pleafant Thing a Wife to be, When we, around the Hearth, our Offspring fee. If I'm fo happy, I fhall take Delight To hear their little Wants, and keep them tight. O Jenny ! Can there greater Pleafure be, Than to have Children fondling on your Knee; When all they aim at, and their greateft Blifs, Is to be notic'd with a tender Kifs ; Can there be Toil in watching Day and Night, In Care of them, when Love makes Care Delight ?
