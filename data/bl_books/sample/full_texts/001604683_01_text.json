Its etymo logy is not involved in so much obscurity as that of many other places, as it evidently derives its name from the Latin word Ripa, which refers to the situation of the Town, and was called by the Saxons Hrippun.

By him it was built new from the ground with hewn stone, and supported by various kinds of pillars and porticoes,f and, when completed was consecrated with great solemnity by himself, to the honour of St. Peter, in the presence of king Egfrid and all the Abbots and great men of that kingdom. + This prelate was then in high favour with Oswy and Egfrid, kings of Northumberland, and the principal nobility, by whose Liberality he rose to such a degree of opulence, as to vie with princes, which enabled him to build several rich Monasteries; but his great pomp, grandeur, magnificence, ' and immense wealth, having drawn upon him the jealousy of the King and the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was at length exiled ; but after an absence of ten years was allowed to return to his See, He died in the Monas tery of Oundle, in 711, aged 76, and was interred here ; but in 940 his remains were removed to Can terbury, by Odo, Archbishop of that See.

The Monastery flourished about 200 years after the death of Wilfrid, when king Edred, enraged at the rebellion of the Northumbrian Danes, in 950,1 carried fire and sword through the north, and included it and the town in the general destruction ; but Odo, Arch bishop of Canterbury, caused soon afterwards a new work, says Leland, \" to be edified wher the Minstre now is.\" The old Monastery stood at some little distance from the present Minster, in a place where was formerly a chapel of our Lady,\u00a7 part of the walls of which are yet visible.

The west Front, the Towers, the Transept, with some part of the Choir and the Aisles, appear to be the work of this prelate, which corresponds with the time when the narrow pointed Gothic arch began to take place of the Saxon one.* The body of the Church is of much later date ; for after the invasion of the Scots, A. D. 1317, in the reign of Edward II. by whom the Town and Minster were destroyed, it is said to have been re-edified not long afterwards, under the care of Archbishop Melton, assisted by contributions from the neighbouring gentry, when the three Spires were erected, and the windows adorned with painted glass.f It then consisted of the Transept and Choir, as at present, of a single Nave very old Werk standing.

The Dean and Chapter also nominate and appoint the Vicars. It is both parochial and collegiate, and is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Wilfrid, built in the form of a Cross, is elegant and light, the Arches pointed, and the columns adorned with round Pillars and fluted. At the west end are two Towers, and in the middle the great Tower of St. Wilfrid, all about 110 feet high, on which were formerly spires of wood covered with lead; but the great Spire, 120 feet high, 49 feet square at its base, and 4j feet square at the top, on St. Wilfrid's Tower, being blown down in 1660, which did considerable injury to the Church, the other two were, to prevent a similar misfortune, taken down a few years afterwards. By the fall of this Spire, two of the Saxon Arches supporting the Lant ern were broken down, and are replaced by two Gothic ones \u2014 a deformity very observable on entering the Church. The Towers being formed to support leaden spires are flat and heavy; but the late Dean, in 1797, having caused open battlements and pinnacles to be added to them, this apparent heaviness, has been much relieved, and the appearance of the whole greatly improved. On entering the Nave at the great west door, the long and lofty appearance of this part of the Church, strikes the eye, and, also the more distant view of the vaulted Arches of the Choir and east Window. The Roof is new, in pannels, with fluted mouldings, on a"], [20, "8 RIPON very improved principle. On each side of the body are six Pillars, which form five regular well finished Gothic Arches. The light and richly ornamented tra cery, surrounding the west Window, is very beautiful ; and the upper row of Windows, on both sides of the Nave, which have all been recently repaired, have a neat and uniform appearance.

It com municates with a passage, in which is a Staircase, now walled up, leading to the Choir, under the Sub-Dean's seat, as an entrance for the Priest. In the north Transept, near the entrance into the Choir, stands a stone Pulpit of curious workmanship, formerly used for preaching in. In a Chapel (now used for the Blackett's Vault) near to this Pulpit, are many relics, as a Helmet, Ensigns, Gauntlets, &c, vestiges of the early civil Wars. The Windows of both the Transepts are of Saxon Architecture, and originally corresponded with the Arches of the great Tower, but two of which are now stately Gothic, of considerable height. The Choir is separated from the body of the Church, by a neat Screen of stone, ornamented with handsome carved work, nearly twenty feet high ; and containing twenty-four niches, in each of which, are ancient statues representing Kings, Abbots, and Bishops, and other characters usually seen in Cathedral Churches. In the centre is the door opening into the Choir, on which is carved the arms of the See of York, Archbishop Rotherham, and other benefactors. Over the Screen is a fine toned Organ, built by Mr. Booth, of Leeds, in 1 833, with the exception of four stops belonging to the old Organ, which was built by Gerard Smith in 1696.

The carved wood work over these Stalls, is deserving of particular attention, as it is allowed to exhibit a delicacy and lightness, superior to almost any other religious edifice possessing similar decorations.

The finials before the Stalls, and the crockets to the seats are of exquisite workmanship, particularly those at the Dean's, Sub-Dean's, and Archbishop's Seats ; as are also two small canopies, one near the Mayor's the other adjoining the Archbishop's Seat. The following page of wood Cuts, exhibits a few specimens of the Basso-relievos under these seats.

This, with the Vestry-room, and Vaults underneath, part of which is the Bone-House, appears to be by far the most ancient part of the structure.

Much had been said of the austerities of the Monks of the Cistertian order of Rivaulx, and they determined to embrace the rules of this society, and applied for that purpose to Thurstan, Archbishop of York, whom they requested to favour their designs, as well as visit their Abbey, and endeavour to restore discipline to its original purity. The Prelate, with many of the Clergy, went to St. Mary's, where they found the Abbot and his attendants preparing to oppose his resolutions, and threatened to punish the discontented Monks. He was refused admittance into the chapter-house, when a riot ensued, and the Prelate baring interdicted the Abbot and Monks, left the Monastery, taking under his protection the Prior, Sub-prior, and eleven Monks, who withdrew from the convent, and were entertained by the Archbishop, for eleven weeks.* During this time the Abbot made frequent complaints to the King, Bishops, and Abbots, against the Archbishop, for de priving him of part of his flock. Two of them soon afterwards returned, but one of them early repented and re-joined his companions. The other fond of the benedictine luxury, continued in the convent.

Abbot was Richard, their late prior at St. Mary's, who with the Monks, retired to their desert, resting en tirely on providence for their support. During part of the winter, a large elm tree was their only shelter; they afterwards retired under the melancholy shade of seven yew trees, growing near where the Abbey now stands. One of them was blown down in 1757,* the other six are now (1833) standing. They are of great magnitude, the largest being twenty feet in circum ference, within three feet from the ground. Under these, it should seem, they resided till the monastery was built. The fame of their sanctity induced many to resort to them, which proportionably increased their distress, and rendered their poverty still more severe ; for in vain did the Abbot solicit relief, as famine that year had extended all over the country, and the leaves of trees and herbs, except a small supply from the Archbishop, were their only food. In the midst of all their wants and sufferings, when their provisions amounted only to two loaves and a half, a stranger solicited their charity, when the Abbot directed that one of the loaves should be given him, observing that the Almighty could provide for them. Soon after Eustace Fitz-John, Lord of Knaresbrough, supplied them with a cart load of bread. For more than two years they laboured under every hardship poverty could inflict, till Hugh, Dean of York, who was very rich, labouring under a disease likely to prove fatal, resolved to end his days among them.

Robert de Sartis, knight, and his wife, gave their town of Harteshows, and lands adjacent to it, with the forest of Warkesall, and were buried in the convent. Serlo de Pembroke, also gave them the expiatory gift of the village of Caiton, and was here interred. In 1140, the building had considerably increased, when, in the war between Stephen and his competitor, a party of soldiers, at the instance of William, Arch bishop of York, came here and burnt the monastery. In 1204, John de Eboraco, abbot, laid the found ation of the Church. His successor, John de Pherd, carried on the work with spirit, and John of Kent, the next abbot, is supposed to have completed the building. But the great tower, it should seem, from the style of the architecture, was either built or heightened subsequent to the death of John of Kent, in 1245. Profusion of wealth, with many grants and privi leges now poured in upon them, but extravagance, the too frequent attendant on wealth, proved, not long after, the cause of much affliction to the monks, for in 1294, they became in want of necessaries, which Romain, then archbishop of York, attributed to their flagrant dissolute conduct, and says they were the derision of the kingdom.

William Thrust or Thirske, the last abbot but one, was hanged at Tyburn, in 1537, with Sir John Bul mer, and others, who were concerned in religious commotion at that time. The following letter throws some light on the character of this priest. It is ad \u25a0 dressed by Layton, one of the visitors employed by King Henry, to Lord Cromwell, who was very zealous in suppressing the abbeys, and humbling the power of the clergy. \" Please your worship to understand that the Abbot of Fountayns hath so greatly delapidate his house, wasted ye woods, notoriously keeping six whores ; and six days before our coming he committed theft and sacrilege, confessing the same; for at mid night he caused his chapleyn to stele the keys of the sexton and took out a jewel, a cross of gold with Burton's Monast."], [79, "61 STUDLEY. stones, one Warren, a goldsmyth of the chepe was with him in his chambre at the hour, and there they stole out a great emerode with a rubye, the said War ren made the Abbot believe the ruby was a garnet, and so for that he paid nothing, for the emerode, but \u00a320.

The architecture is mixed; in some parts are seen the sharp-pointed windows, in others the circular arches. The great east window is magnificently grand and the arch much pointed.

It consisted of three aisles formed by two rows of columns, five in each, upon which the arches and groins of the roof rested, springing from corresponding brackets at the sides. Over the Chapter House, were the Library and Scriptorum. In 1790 and 1791, a large quantity of rubbish within the Chapter-house being removed, se veral Tombs of the Abbots were discovered. The Floor has been a fine tesselated Pavement, of which there are some remains.

But the present worthy owner, who is solicitous only to preserve the building from ruin, caused them to be immediately rebuilt; and such has been the care and skill of the workmen employed, that it requires the nicest eye to distinguish the new arches from the old ones.

The writer observes, that, upon his going to live at Bolton, Jenkins was said to be about 160 years old. He said he was sent to Northallerton, with a horse load of Arrows, for the Battle of Flodden Field, with which a bigger boy went forward to the Army under the Earl of Surrey, and he believed himself then 1513, to be eleven or twelve years old. He gave evidence in Court to 120 years, in a Tithe cause, 1667, be tween the Vicar of Catterick and WiUiam Peter Mawbank, The writer was present at another cause, between Mr. Hawes and Mr. Wastell of Ellerton. where he also gave evidence to 120 years. The Judge"], [95, "75 STUDLEY asked him how he had lived, he answered by Thatching and Salmon-fishing, The writer went to see him at Ellerton-upon-Swale, when he told him that he re jnembered the Dissolution, and that great lamentations were made ; that he had been Butler to Lord Conyers df Hornby Castle, and that Marmaduke Bradley, Lord .bbot of Fountains, did frequently visit his Lord, and drink a hearty glass with him ; and that his Lord often sent him to inquire how the Abbot did, who always sent for him to his lodgings, and ordered him, besides Wassail, a quarter of a yard of roast-beef for his din ner, and a great black jack of strong drink. The following is an extract of a Letter* from Ann Seville, sister to Mr. Wastell. \" One time he was sworn in a Cause at York to 140 years Memory which the Judge reproving him for, not thinking him so old, called up two other old Men, and asked them if they knew Henry Jenkins, and how old he might be : these Men were 100 years old, or above; they said they knew him very well; as for his age they could not tell, but that he was an elderly man ever since they knew him, but he was born in another Parish, and before Parish Registers were used in Churches ; so the Judge called him up again and asked him if ever he had any Children, and he told him yes; he never had any more than two Lads, and they were both in Court; so the Judge had a desire to see these two Lads, when they came up the one was 100 and the other 102 years old, and the Judge greatly admired to see the old man and his two Lads.\" \u2022 Universal Magaiine, 1788"], [96, "76 STUDLEY..

A much greater number of nobility and gentry resort to these places, during the season, than to any other Watering-place in the north. The communication between the two places are by means of four roads, two for carriages, and two foot paths across the fields, which are much shorter as well as pleasanter. On account of the great distance from the parish Churches, the inhabitants were obliged before the year 1744, to attend Divine Service at Knaresbrough, when, by subscription, a Chapel was erected at High Harrogate, Lady Elizabeth Hastings favouring the design, with a donation of 50/. This Chapel has been taken down, and a new Church built, which was con secrated, in 1831, bytheRt. Rev. J. B. Sumner, Lord Bishop of Chester.

The first spring discovered here was the Old Spa, in 1571, by Captain William Slingsby, who found it possessed properties similar to those of the German Spa; it is situated opposite the Granby Inn. He for some time resided at the Grange, and afterwards at Bilton, at that time a royal Park well stocked with Deer. Dr. Bright wrote the first treatise on its virtues and uses; Dr. Dean, in 1626 ; Dr. Stanhope, in 1631 ; Dr. French, in 1651; Dr. Neale, in 1656; and Dr. Simpson, in 1668. This Spring is now covered with a dome, erected in 1786, at the expence of Alexander, Lord Loughborough, who also laid out a plantation on his estate here, comprising oaks, ashes, firs, american chesnuts, mountain ashes, poplars, &c, which form a pleasant and agreeable shade, to a broad walk of two miles long, highly ornamental to the place, and forms an agreeable contrast to the bleak and dreary aspect which formerly presented itself.

Both these Springs are situated at High Harrogate; but the principal, and that which occasions the greatest resort, ate those long celebrated SULPHUR WELLS, at Low Harrogate, which are most f\u0153tidly salutary and efficacious in all Scorbutic complaints. Of these there are also two, each enclosed within a building of stone ; but the water chiefly used for drinking, is received into a circular stone basin which is covered by a leaded dome, supported by eleven stone pillars, where females attend with glasses every morning, to supply the numerous water drinkers; a woman also attends every morning, before breakfast, from each of the Hotels, to serve its company. Besides the immense quantity of this water drank every morn ing, there are persons constantly employed during the day, bottling for distant consumption ; yet such is the copious supply of the Spring, that we have rarely heard of its being even temporarily exhausted. This wate.- was not known, till many years after the discovery of the Steel Waters at High Harrogate ; and when known, was for a long time supposed either too offensive or too dangerous to be taken internally; and therefore, at first, only used as a wash, in diseases of the skin ; but time and experience have proved its virtues; and before the year 1700, it was used both externally and internally by all ranks of people, with amazing success, in Scorbutic and other diseases,"], [105, "5mlplii_iL_> Well HcffliTOcgwte.

By the act of Parliament obtained for the inclosure of the Forest, it is provided, that all persons whom soever, shall and may have free access at all times to these Springs, and be at liberty to use and drink the Waters there arising, and take the benefit thereof, without being subject to the payment of any acknow ledgment whatsoever. A new Spring was discovered in the garden of the Crescent Inn, in the year 1783, which seems best suited to scrofulous complaints. The salt it contains renders it active as a gentle stimulus, to promote the secretions; while the iron tends most powerfully to remove debility, which, Dr. Garnett observes, if not originally the cause of the disease, always retards its cure. This water is raised by a pump, over which stands a cupola, and is the property of Mr. Linforth, the proprietor of the Crescent Inn. The subscription to this well, is half a guinea the season. These mineral waters have been analysed by many eminent Physicians, but by none with more accuracy than Dr, Garnett, from whose valuable treatise, we subjoin the following table : \u2014 see p. 92. In 1819, two new Springs were discovered, a Saline Chalybeate Spring, resembling Cheltenham Water, and a Chalybeate Spring. The Cheltenham Water, as it is called, has come into great repute, and will, no doubt, prove a valuable addition to the Waters at Harrogate. Its properties are alterative and tonic. H"], [108, "86 HARRO&ATK. and have been found particularly useful in cases of debility. Dr. Hunter of Leeds, has published a treatise on these Waters ; they are also particularly noticed by Dr. Scudavrore in his account of Mineral Waters, published in 1820; the analysis of these Waters will be found in the table annexed. Both these wells are situated in the garden of Mr. Oddy, and are his private property, The Cheltenham water is obtained for drinking, by means of a pump, at which a woman attends daily. Each person drink ing the water, pays 2s. 6d. per week, besides some compensation to the attendant. \u2014 Subscribers have the privilege of walking in the garden which is laid out with much taste. In 1822, Mr. Thackwray of the Crown Hotel, dis covered a Spring in the grounds east of his house, over which he has erected a neat building, after the manner of a Chinese Temple, and thrown the sur rounding land into pleasure grounds, for the conve nience of his visitors. The water is raised by a pump, through glass tubes, and given to the water drinkers, by a female, who attends every morning for that purpose. The elegant Baths of the Crown, are also supplied from this Spring, by a pump, and conveyed into the house in pipes. Its properties are much similar to those of the Old Sulphur Well, and has been analysed by Mr. West* of Leeds, who published the result of his enquiries in the 29th No. of the Quarterly \" Journal of Science, Lite rature and the Arts,\" in April, 1823, who closes the account in the following words : \u2022 The result of Mr. West's Analysis will be seen in page 93."], [109, "87 HARROGATE. \" To sum up the comparison between the Water from the Old Well, and that from the Crown pump, it appears that both contain the same ingredients, \u2014 solid and gaseous ; that the new well has rather the greatest impregnation of the gases ; that the Old Well contains rather more common salt ; while the water of the New Pump holds a considerably greater proportion of the active constituents, \u2014 the Muriate of Lime and of Magnesia.\" This Spring was at first intended for the visitors to the Crown only, but Mr. Thackwray has now very liberally thrown it open to the public. The company, in general, rise early, and repair to the wells; whence, after drinking the water, they return and breakfast at separate tables, as they chance, or choose to go in. The time betwixt this and dinner, is generally spent in making excursions into different parts of the neighbourhood, which abounds with many places well worth the attention of strangers: when the weather will not permit these excursions, a variety of amusements offer themselves within doors, as read ing, playing at billiards, cards, &c. At dinner, each person takes his or her seat, in the order they arrive at the place, and ascends gradually, as others leave it. Among the places of amusement and public resort, is Langdale's Library and Reading Room, at High Harrogate, conducted by the late Mr. Hargrove for above haif a century; it contains a valuable and nume rous collection of Books : adjoining to which, is the spacious Reading Room, provided with Newspapers, Magazines, &c, for the use of subscribers to the Library. The terms of subscription will be found very"], [110, "88 HARROGATE. reasonable. Here is also a choice collection of Books on sale, in various bindings ; with a large assortment of Stationary, &c. The Theatre, situate at High Harrogate, which was built by the late Mr. Samuel Butler, and opened by him in 1788, is now converted into dwelling-houses. The Race- ground, which is at High Harrogate, is one mile and a quarter in circumference, and sixteen yards wide, was laid out and finished in the year 1793, under the inspection of Colonel Clement Wolsley. There are three public dress Balls a week, to which the company are invited, at each house in regular ro tation as follows, viz. Monday Evening, at the Dra gon ; on Wednesdays, at the Crown ; and on Fridays, at the Granby; and occasionally at the Queen's Head. Dancing generally commences at nine o'clock. Each person pays one shilling admittance, which is applied towards the expences ; the remaining part, is paid by those gentlemen who choose the amusement of dancing. The Promenade Room, from its vicinity to the Wells, at Low Harrogate, is a great accommodation to the visitors; for when the weather is unfavourable for excursions, they find amusement in this room. The erection of this building was first suggested by G. Cayley, M. D. and was opened for the reception of company, in 1805. The dimensions are 75 feet long and 30 broad. The doors are opened at seven o'clock, and continue till sunset, from May to November. Newspapers, Magazines, Reviews, and other pub lications, are provided for the use of subscribers, who are admitted on moderate terms. On Sunday even ings, during the season, there is Sacred Music on tbe"], [111, "89 HARROGATE. Organ : which is also played on the week days for the entertainment of the company. No admittance to any but subscribers. By the exertions of several benevolent persons, prin cipally visitors, at Harrogate, a public meeting was held on the 31st of August, 1821, the Earl of Hare wood, in the Chair, when a determination was entered into to erect Baths and Hospital Wards, for the benefit of the Poor, and which were, in 1825, in part opened. They are situated near the Bog wells, west of the Old Sulphur Well. By the inclosure act, passed in 1789, a power is vested in the commissioners, or any two of them, \" for draining, levelling, or otherwise improving the said land, by planting trees thereon for shelter and orna ment, and making walks and paths in, on, and over the same ; and for protecting the said Springs, called Harrogate Spaws, from pollution, or other injury,\" &c. We cannot but regret that these powers have laid so long dormant, as few places of public resort are capable of, or require more ornamental improvement, than Harrogate. Harrogate is distant from the following places, to which excursions are frequently made.

Directions for using the Waters. Chalybeate Water. Patients, whose cases require the Chalybeate water, should begin with the Tewit Well or Old Spa, drinking about half a pint three or four times a day ; having a few days previous taken the Sulphur water in such manner as to procure about two stools a day. The best times, are early in the morning, about two hours before dinner, and in the after noon, riding or walking about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour between each glass. The SULPHUR WATER. It is usual to repair to this well early in the morning, and drink the water at the fountain head, that the volatile prin ciple may not escape. When taken as a purgative, it is best to begin with a glass of die common size, containing rather more than half a pint; to walk or ride immediately after drinking it; another glass may be taken in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and after the same interval a third. It will be some times, though not often, necessary to take a fourth. Where the waters do not readily go ofl' by stools after taking three glasses. it is advisable to dissolve a small quantity of Epsom Salts in the first glass. If any oppression or sickness arises at the stomach from the drinking of tha water, a longer interval is required between the glasses. When taken as an alterative, one or two glasses may be taken before breakfast, half an hour distant between each other; and another glass may be taken about an hour before dinner. Some people in this case, will drink a glass just when going to bed, \" but let such (says Dr. Alexander) as conform to it be cautious to eat little supper, and at least two hours before this bed time draught.\" Indeed it is best at all times taken upon an empty stomach. A course of tins water, as well as of the Chalybeates, may require from three to five or six weeks or upwards, according to the nature and violence of the disease. CRESCENT Water. Of all the waters of this place, this seems the best suited to strengthen the stomach and promote digestion. The usual times of taking it are before breakfast, betwixt breakfast and dinner, and in the evening ; the common dose is from half a pint to a pint, or from one to two glasses; it will be always prudent to begin with half a glass; and if that dose is found to agree, it maybe gradually increased to one or two glasses."], [113, "HARROGATE. 91 The Saline Chalybeate Well. Of this water, from half a piatto two pints daily should be taken, commencing with a small quantity for a few days; the first dose should be taken at seven o 'Clock in the morning; the second at noon ; and the third about three in the afternoon. A small por' tion of biscuit, with the dose of water in the morning, is recommended. WARM BATHING. A circumstance of the greatest consequence in warm bathing, is the proper regulation of the heat of the bath. The degrees of heat in the bath, ought always to be determined by a ther mometer. The patient should never go into the bath, heated at first to a greater temperature than the human blood, which is about 98 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer : 94 or 96 degrees is the heat most commonly n> commended. Alter he has been in the bath a few minutes, the tempera ture may be gradually raised three or four degrees higher, but no farther. Respecting the time of continuing in the bath, it p'liould at first be very short; the first time, the patient may remain in it five minutes, and i/he find no inconvenience from it, he may gradually increase the time to above a juarter of an hour, or if his constitution be pretty strong, to twenty miute\u00bb beyond this time it would not be safe.\u2014 Baths are to be met with in almost every house."], [114, "A TABLE, exhibiting the contents of a Wine Gallon of surrogate Waters. * Adjoining the Leeds road, and opposite the Crescent Inn. -f Scudamore.

Part of the Towers and some semi-round buttresses yet remain, and a square Tower or Keep, is the most complete of any, part of which formerly served as a prison for the liberty of the Forest of Knaresbrough. Mr. King thus mentions it in his account of ancient Castles, read before the Society of Antiquaries in 1782;* of which, he has given a south elevation and ground plan. \" This Keep,\" he observes, \" is very curious, and extraordinary in its whole structure and design. The wall, even in the weakest part, is about ten feet thick. The grand portal is highly enriched, and of a very singular form ; having, in the upper part of the arch, the appearance of the tracery of a window; a circum stance that may easilj' mislead an unwary observer. Yet, that it really was the great entrance, and not a window, appears from its dimensions being so much greater than those of any of the windows, from its bottom being exactly level with the floor of the apart ments adjoining ; and from the remains of the founda tion of steps plainly leading up to it, which may clearly be seen just beneath. f Below, on the right, is another smaller arched entrance, which seems to have been just under the draw-bridge, Like that at Rochester, and leads into the ground rooms. Under the grand portal is still another arch, originally con cealed, in all probability, beneath the steps and plat form of entrance, and leading to the vaults below.

At the third story is one of the great windows of the state apartment. The longest room on the ground floor is supported by two great pillars; the one an hexagon, the other square. This was manifestly designed to hold stores ; and accordingly, in a recess on the left, is a square well, within the thickness of the wall, for the drawing up beams and other parts of military ma- chines. A winding staircase communicates with the upper apartments. Adjoining the large vaulted room, is a second smaller arched vault, having no light or air, except, what came through the doors, and through a small inner window, lighted merely by a loop from the N. W. corner room or cell. At the corner, over the precipice above the river, is a small cell, having a loop open to the outside of the Castle. On the right is another little vault, or dungeon, no less singular than the record-room; and, like it, neither has,- nor ever had, any communication with the inside of the Keep. It now serves for a prison. From some arches remaining on the insides of the wall of the Keep, it appears plainly, that the room on the first principal floor, where the great arched portal is, had an exceed- ing fine arched roof of stone-work; and we may easily conceive that the state apartments above were not less magnificent.\" It was founded by Serlo de Burgh, who came into England with the Conqueror. He was succeeded in"], [119, "KNARESBROUGH. 97 his possession by Eustace Fitz John, the great fa vourite of Henry the first.* It afterwards came into the possession of the crown, for it seems that King John granted it to William de Estoteville, for the ser vices of the three knight's fees.f In the succeeding reign it was bestowed on that great justiciary, Hubert de Burgh, on payment of \u00a3100 per annum into the exchequer. In the reign of Edward the Second it was in the family of the Vaux.t or de Valibus, but bestowed by that prince on his favourite, Piers Gavestone,\u00a7 whom he created earl of Cornwall. On his death it reverted to the crown, and remained in it till 1371, when, the castle, manor, and honour of Knaresbrough, were granted by Edward the third to his fourth son, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, in which duchy, it yet remains. || In 1770, the four knights who murdered Thomas a Becket, took refuge here, where they remained prisoners many months, but were some time after par- doned, on condition of their performing a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After the base treachery, Richard the Second ex perienced from the earl of Northumberland and his gallant son Hotspur Percy, that unfortunate Prince was kept a close prisoner here, in an apartment still called the King's Chamber, till he was removed to Pontefract Castle, and there murdered by order of Henry the Fourth. \u2022 Dugdale's Baron, vol. 1. p. 90. t Ihid. 457.

After the battle of Marston Moor, the townsmen most gallantly defended it against Lord Fairfax, and though at last compelled to surrender, it was on the most honourable terms that the garrison laid down their arms. Not long after this it was with many other castles, by resolution of the House of Commons rendered untenable. The site of the castle, which commands a most beautiful view of the river, church, part of the town, Coghill-hall, dropping-well, bridge, woods, &c. was upwards of an hundred yards in diameter.

This seat of piety was, in 1745, profaned by the murder of Daniel Clark, of Knaresbrough, who, with Eugene Aram and J.

Here these as sociates in iniquity assembled to divide their stolen property, and to settle how it might be disposed of, when Clark was murdered by Aram and Houseman, and buried in the cave. After he had disappeared, it was the general opinion that he had absconded. Some short time afterwards, Aram retired into Norfolk, where he lived upwards of 13 years, when the hand of Providence pointed out the murder in a peculiar manner.

Aram was at this time (1758) usher at a school at Lynn, in Norfolk, where he was apprehended, and brought to York castle, when he was tried and convicted. On his trial he delivered a written defence, so admirable for its in genuity, and so replete with erudition and antiquarian knowledge, that it astonished the whole court. He attempted to prevent his execution by suicide, in which he succeeded so far as to be brought to the scaffold almost in a state of insensibility ; but before this at tempt, he made a full confession of his guilt. \u2014 Though he derived little advantage from education, yet, from the acuteness of his understanding, and his intensely studious disposition, he had acquired considerable knowledge in the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Celtic, and other languages, and had beside made great progress in the higher branches of Mathematics, Heraldry, Antiquities, &c* Here lived, till within these few years, that very extraordinary man John Metcalfe, who was a native of this place.

At a small distance, on the west side of the town, are those remarkable monuments, called, Cfie Btbil'i &rrohj<S, which consist of three large obelisks of stone. In Leland's time there were four; but in the seventeenth csntury, one of them was pulled down, or, from some unknown cause, fell to the ground; part of which now makes the battlement of a foot bridge over a small brook, ( the Tut,) near the town.* The remaining ones are placed at unequal distances from each other, the centre being 199 feet from the north, and the south 360 feet from the centre, and aLl in the form of an obelisk. The tops are seemingly split and fur- rowed by the stealing hand of time. The tallest (the centre one,) is 30 feet 6 inches from the bottom, about 6 feet of which are buried in the ground; its greatest circumference is 16 feet; the others differ little in dimensions from the former. In 1 709, Mr. Morris, forty years vicar of Aldborough, caused the ground to be opened about the middlemost of these obelisks, nine feet wide. He at first found a good soil about a foot deep, and then a course of stones, rough, and of several kinds, but most were large cob- bles (pebbles) laid in a bed of coarse grit and clay, and so for four or five courses underneath, one upon another, round about the pyramid, in alL probability to keep it upright; nevertheless, they all seem to in cline a Little to the south east.

Richard Franck, a singular traveller, and famous peripatetic angler, in his tour to the northern parts of Scotland, to enjoy his favourite amusement, which he published in 1694, says that he saw, near Borough bridge, seven of these stones ; in which he must have been mistaken, as it is not likely that they have in creased since the days of Leland. Camden observes, \" the many, and those learned men, are of opinion that the stones are not natural, but an artificial com pound of sine sand, Lime, and vitriol, ( for of this they fancy it has some grains;) as also of an oily unctuous matter, much like those cisterns at Rome, which Plin}' tells us weie made of sand and hot lime so compact and firm, that one would have taken them for real stone.\"* This opinion is evidently founded in error, as the marks of the chisel below the surface of the earth are proofs of a real and not factitious stone. It is of that common course rag-stone, or mill-stone grit, so very common in the north of England, a large rock of which stone, and from which probably, these obelisks were taken, is at Plumpton near Knaresbrough.\u2014 \u2022 Gibson's Camden, v. ii p. 96.

Doctor Stillingfleet considers them as British deities; Leland, Camden, Doctor Lister, and Drake, suppose them to have been the work of the Romans, and erected by that people as trophies to commemorate some important victory. The similarity of their foun dations, to the walls of Isurium, as well as their vici nity to that city, and their greatest military road, will scarcely allow as to attribute the erection of them to any other people but the Romans, particularly when we consider that British cities were only enclosed with ramparts of earth, and a number of trees cut down and piled together.

Aldburgh, or, Aldborough, so called by the Nor mans, the Iseur of the ancient Britons, and the Isurium of the Romans. This once celebrated city, which has, ever since the days of Leland, arrested the attention and engaged the particular notice of British antiqua ries, is now sunk into a small village, and in danger of losing the remains of its ancient splendour. It com prises about 107 houses, and a parish church dedi cated to St. Andrew, situated on the south bank of the river Ure, about half a mile from Boroughbridge. The houses, although much detached from each other, are chiefly within the walls of the old city, except one, whieh has been partly erected upon the wall itself. Its rich and beautiful tesselated pavements are, by the dilapidating hands of travellers, and the curiosity of antiquaries, rapidly d^mmishing ; and with the ex ception of a mound of earth, now cultivated, and a trench nearly filled up, parrallel to it, which point out where the old walls once stood, there are few vestiges remaining of this ancient city; \" the plot being con verted into pasture and arable ground, so that the evidence of history itself would be suspected in testi fying this to be the old Isurium, if the name of the river Ure, and the Roman coins frequently digged up here, and the distance between it and York, according"], [134, "112 ALDBOROUGH. to Antoninus, were not incontrovertible evidence of its existence.\"* Though we have no account from history or tradi tion of origin, yet we have the most incontestible evi dence of its great antiquity; and that it was the me tropolis of the Brigantes, is a fact which can never be called in question. Many British Princes resided here, and it is mare than probable, from the extent and magnitude of its foundation, and its central situa tion, that it was the seat of government, as it flourished many ages prior to York; Venutius, who opposed the brave Caractacus, residing here in the year 50. f Pe tilius Cerealis, the most consummate general of his age, soon afterwards defeated Venutius, and having laid the country waste, it is most likely that Isurium would experience the ill effects resulting from his conquest. The brave Agricola, whose wisdom beamed a double lustre on triumphant Rome, after having subdued the Brigantes about the year 79 or 80, resided at York, and made it his head-quarters, which shews that Isu rium had sunk in the estimation of the Romans, while York was rising into eminence. When Severus re sided at the latter place, where he kept his court, it had, at that early period, become a city of conside rable extent. Isurium, however, was a place of great importance till the year 766, when it was attacked with much fury by the Danes, who murdered the greatest part of the inhabitants, and after having committed every species of cruelty, burnt the city to the ground. \u00a3 t Gibson's Camden. + Tacitus.

As the inhabitants would, before this melancholy event, dread the firry of their implacable enemies, much property, it is supposed, was buried previous to their entering the city, which may account for the numberless curiosities that have since been found, and future ages may be gratified with many more. But the most fatal blow given to this once celebrated city, was the turning of the road, which went through it, by removing the bridge over the Ure, to where it now stands, at Boroughbridge, which happened during the reign of the Conqueror. In the time of the Romans it was defended by a strong wall, a small part of which is yet visible, and the whole easily traced, though even in Leland's time the ruins were slender; who observes, \"Vestigia qu\u00e6 dam, sed tenuaria.\" The dimensions, from actual survey made in 1817, are east and west sides, about 654 yards each; south end, 468, and the north, 401 yards: making a circumference of 2177 yards, as will appear from the plan annexed. In the times of the Britons, Romans, and Saxons, it was divided by two principal roads, one from south to north, called the Ermine-street,* which passed nearly through the centre of it, and over the river Ure, by a wooden bridge, half a mile below the present stone one at Boroughbridge; the other road crossed it at nearly right angles, and is yet called the Roman road. The foundation of these roads weie laid by the Romans with stones of great magnitude, which have been frequently dug up. * The Ermine-street commenced in the southern parts of the kingdom, passing through London, Roystone, Huntingdon, Doncaster, Aldborough, Catterick, Bowes, Appleby, to Carlisle\u2014 Cade on the Roman Roads. s 3"], [136, "114 ALDBOROUGH.

Drake supposes it to be an oucwork for the security of the town, the great military road coming close by it. The hill has however, of late years, been ploughed, and the ap pearance of its former greatness is no more. The following, which is the substance of a letter from the Reverend Mr. Morris, vicar of that place, to Bishop Gibson, the continuator of Camden, will shew the vast quantaties of Roman Coin, &c. which were formerly dug up here. \" In the late civil wars, as some workmen were digging a cellar they met with a sori. of a vault, leading as it is said, to the river. If of Roman work, (for it has not yet been ascertained,) it might probably be a repository for the dead.

There are some of Maximian, Dio clesian, Valerian, Severus, Pertinax, Aurelius, and other Emperors ; as well of Faustina aud Julia. They meet with little Roman heads of brasp, and have formerly found coined pieces of gold, with chains of the same metal; but none of late. About two years ago were found four signet polished stones, three of which were carnelions. The first had a horse upon it, and a stump of laurel shooting out five branches. The second, a Roman sitting with a sacrificing dish in one hand, and resting the other on a spear. The third, a Roman, if not Pallas, with a spear in one hand, wearing a helmet, with a shield on the back, or on the other arm, ?nd under that something like a quiver hanging to the knee. The fourth, of a purple colour, has a Roman head like Severus, or Antoine. Several pavements have been found, about a foot under ground, compassed about with big stones, about an inch square; but within are small atones of a quarter of that size, wrought into knots and flowers after the mosaic fashion. No altars are met with, but pieces of urns and old glass are common.\" The house most famed for curiosities was kept, in 1736, by a person of the name of Aldburgh, since that by a female dwarf, and at present by a person of the name of Pibus. Here is shown a Roman pavement, in great preservation, about 1 8 inches below the sur face, first discovered in 1731; and in the same room are many other ancient remains, particularly a votive stone, found at Deuil Cross in 1776; and in the"], [138, "ALDBOROUGH. 116 garden behind are the remains of a Roman altar, found about the year 1782. In another house, at a small distance, is a beautiful tesselated pavement, composed of small squares of black and white brick, inclosed in a neat red border. As most of this ancient city is in grass, and ha9 seldom been turned with the plough, vast treasure remains to be discovered in ages yet to come. In 1770, as some workmen were throwing up ground for the purpose of making a road within the city, they discovered the foundations of a range of buildings, 226 feet long and 18 broad, running from S. E. to N. W.* These were most likely the relics of those buildings burnt by the Danes, when they entered the city in 766: They appeared about three feet thick and five below the present surface. In 1772, some very large stones were dug up, sup posed to be part of the eastern gate or portal. 1794, the foundations of the city wall being laid open for the barbarous purpose of getting out the stone, the breadth was discovered to be about 15 feet, and the depth nearly of the same dimensions. The first 7 feet were composed of rough grit, mixed with lime and sand; the other eight composed of large peb bles or paving stonesf laid in a bed of blue clay, and the interstices filled up with hard cement of lime, sand, and gravel; near the foundation were discovered part of a sacrificing vessel, pieces of Urns, several pieces of Millstone grit, horns of Deer sawed off, the head of \u2022 A Plan of which, drawn by the B\u00e6v.

In the latter end of April, 1832, while some ser vants were digging in their master's orchard, they came to a most beautiful tesselated pavement, at a little more than a yard from the surface ; on exami nation, they found it to be of great extent ; the checks small, and exhibiting a great variety of colours ; and the figure of a Lion rampant, represented in the centre. It is considered the finest specimen of a Ro man pavement that has ever been discovered at this village. The learned Roger Gale was of opinion, that these pavements were the floors of banqueting houses, or of the grand apartments, chief rooms or baths, in the private houses of the higher class of people. In the centre of the city is BOROUGH-HILL, formerly four yards high and thirty-three in diameter, where probably the Britons had their court of Justice, Markets, and places for sacrificing. In 1683, the upper part of the hill was taken down, when there were found two bases of pillars of regular order, the foundation wall of a considerable building laid open, tesselated pavements, large stones of coarse grit with joints for cramping, sacrificing vessels, flews, or hollow square pipes for the conveyance of smoke or warm air, bones, and horns of beasts, chiefly Stags, an Ivory needle, and a Copper Roman style or pin.* Upon this eminence the inhabitants assembled to elect Members to represent this Borough in Parlia- * Drake'* Ebor."], [140, "118 ALDBOROUGH. ment, a privilege granted to them in 1558;* but it was disfranchised by the passing of the reform biH, on the 7th of June, 1832.

How it came to be alienated from that religious house, does not appear; but in so long a time, and so replete with troubles and changes, it can be no wonder to see it in the crown in the time of Edward II, who having created his fa vourite, Piers de Gavestone, earl of Cornwall, among other estates, ordered the Sheriff of Yorkshire to give him possession of this manor of Aldburgh, and after wards gave him a charter* of free warrant in all the demesne lands of that lordship; but he being taken off by the Barons, it reverted to the crown. * Magna Britannia."], [143, "WEWBY HAII, The seat of the right honourable Earl de Gret, four miles from Ripon, and twelve from Harrogate; is situated on the north bank of the river Ure.

The astonishing increase of motion with the little force I gave it, made me ap prehensive that the equilibrium might be destroyed, but on examining it, I found it so truly balanced, that there was no danger of it falling. The construction of this equipoised stone must have been by artists well skilled in the powers of mathematics.

Sir William Aldburgh left two daughters, between whom his estates were divided; Elizabeth marrying to her second husband Sir Richard Redmayne; and Sybille, Sir William Ryther, in the time of Richard II.; which two families seem to have held them till about the 38th of Elizabeth, each inhabiting the house alter nately.

It is broken into a great variety of surfaces, by small pointed arches, with single shaft columns, and orig inally gave light to the west end of the church, by three tall and graceful lancet windows. Over the \u25a0r"], [168, "146 BOLTON PRIORY. transept was a tower ; the want of this feature at pres ent is the capital defect at Bolton as an object. But instead of this, appears a very singular and misplaced work at the west end. \u2014 I mean the base of another tower, with an inscription in front, begun by the last prior, which partly hides and partly darkens the beautiful west front of the church. To compensate, however, for this injury, it is built of the finest mason ry, and adorned with shields, statues, and one window of beautiful late Gothic tracery.\" \" North of the high altar is the rich canopy of a tomb within a recess of the wall, beneath which a skeleton was lately found, supposed to have belonged to Lady Margaret Neville. On the south side of the choir are the remains of a chantry, opening into it by a rich ornamented arch beneath, which appears to have been a tomb, with a doorway, as usual, at the head. Under this is the mouth of a vault, now almost choaked up with rubbish, but remembered to have nearly crossed the choir, and here, most probably, was the resting place of the Lords of Skipton and Patrons of Bolton.\" \" The cloister court, containing the Chapter-house, Refectory, Kitchen, Dormitory, &c, with the excep tion of a few fragments, is destroyed. Much lower, and beneath, at the east end of the church, stood the prior's lodgings.\" \" On the site of the kitchen, stands the school master's house, a foundation of the incomparable Ro bert Boyle. The old school has been modernized by the taste of the present inhabitant, into a light and pleasant dining room. The present school was one"], [169, "147 BRANDRITH CRAGS. of the offices of the priory, as old as the foundation \" \" In the general wreck of the offices at Bolton, the pathway alone escaped. It is a strong square castel lated building of late gothic architecture, the outer and inner arch of which having been walled up, an handsome groined and vaulted apartment has been obtained within.\" Above this place is seen Barden Tower, crowning the bold banks of the river, and in the beautiful and romantic grounds of Bolton park are many fine woody scenes, admitting, occasionally, peeps at the river, with rich open distances. On the right of the road to Bolton Priory, and about nine miles from Harrogate, is BRAADRITH CHAOS, a range of rocks, situate on the edge of a precipice, overlooking a deep and extensive vale called \" Kex gill.\" Here is a rocking stone, whose weight is pro bably 20 tons; and yet it is easily moved with one hand. On the summit of one. of the highest rocks, is a basin,* 3 feet 6 inches in diameter, and 2 feet in depth; here are also several other basins, of smaller dimensions. If we suppose these rocks to have been once shaded with oaks, this place would then exactly answer the description given of the sacred groves and rock altars of the most ancient idolaters. '\u2022Rock Basins, it has been conjectured, were cut for the purpose of preser ving dew, or rain, as it descended from the heavens; which was used by the Druids in their ablutions and sprinklings, performed with vervain and ausletoe.\u2014 Vide Borlace's Hist, of Cornwall."], [170, "A LIST OF THE RARE INDIGENOUS PLANTS, In S>tuBIen CSrounW, &c.
