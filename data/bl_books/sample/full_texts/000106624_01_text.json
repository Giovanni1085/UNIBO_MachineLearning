T\\7'HENEVER popular attention was excited by a murder of ** more than usual interest, the ballad writers of Elizabeth's days promptly brought their pens into play ; and occasionally, even dramatists of high repute condescended to seek materials for a tragedy from the records of contemporary crime. Four of these murder-plays, if the expression may be allowed, have come down : (1) Arden of Feversham, 1592; (2) A Warning for fair Women, 1599 ; (3) Robert Yarington's Two Tragedies in One, 1601 ; (4) A Yorkshire Tragedy,1 1608. Of others only the bare titles are recorded. Two plays entitled Murderous Michael and The Cruelty of a Stepmother were performed at Court so early as 1578. Twenty years afterwards, in 1598, was produced Black Bateman of the North, a play by Chettle, Wilson, Drayton, and Dekker ; and a Second Part, by Chettle and Wilson, followed in the same year. From entries in Henslowe's Diary, it appears that several plays of similar character were produced in 1599. Dekker and Chettle wrote in that year The Stepmother's Tragedy ; Day and Haughton Ihe Tragedy of Merry (otherwise called Beech's Tragedy), and Cox of Collumpton ; and Jonson is found working with Dekker, before the outbreak of hostilities, on Page of Plymouth. To 1602 belong Haughton's Cartv.right, which dealt with the murder of a clergy man, named Storr, by one Cartwright ; an anonymous piece entitled Baxter's Tragedy; and The Bristol Tragedy, by Day, which Collier wrongly identified with an anonymous comedy 1 On the title-page of A Yorkshire Tragedy, the publisher, Thomas Pavier \u2014 the most rascally pu blither of his time\u2014 had the impudence to print Shakespear's name."], [14, "Introduction. IV published in 1605 under the title of The Fair Maid of Bristow. In 1624 was performed A Bristow Merchant, written by Ford and Dekker ; and in the same year Ford joined Webster in writing A Late Murthcr of the Son upon the Mother. Among the manuscript plays destroyed by Warburton's cook was a play of Chapman's entitled The Yorkshire Gentlewoman andher Son (entered in the Stationers' Registers, 29 June, 1660, but never printed), which may have belonged to the class of domestic tragedies. Of the four extant plays Arden of Feversham is unqu estionably the most important. A Warning for Fair Women, as a whole, must be pronounced a bald and prosaic piece of work. Two Tragedies in One, albeit crude and stiff, is a more energetic and workmanlike play than A Warning. Both Yarington and the author of A Warning, studied Arden closely, though they failed to reproduce the excellence of their model. A Yorkshire Tragedy has no points in common with the other murder-plays ; it stands quite apart by itself. A storm of frenzy sweeps over the stage : we see a maniac raging furiously, and shudder as the helpless victims fall before his violence. The ravings of Bedlam are mellow music to the murderer's curses in A Yorkshire Tragedy. Thomas Arden (or Ardern, as the name is more correctly written), was chief comptroller of his Majesty's Customs at Faver sham. He was a jurat in 1544, and was mayor of the town in 1548.' His wife Alice is described as a \"daughter-in-law,\" \u2014 that 1 He left to the corporation some houses and lands, to the value of about forty shillings a year, for the benefit of the poor, and for an annual sermon to be preached in commemoration of the benefactors to the town. The legacy was contested by his daughter's second husband, and partly set aside. A local antiquary, Mr. Charles Smith, of the Market Place, Faversham, informs me (on the authority of the town-clerk, who has possession of all the documents relating to the town), that the money left by Arden was lent out by the corporation to needy persons during the Commonwealth and was lost. The corporation, however, continued to pay the Vicar until 1836, when, by the New Municipal Reform Act, the Borough Fund was no longer available for such purposes. The Vicar continued for some years to preach the annual Mid-Lent sermon, after payment had been dropped ; but at length the Vicar grew tired of doing the work for nothing, or the monotonous story palled on the congregation. The only piece of property remaining now to the town from Arden's will is a small plot of ground (behind the town-hall) where once stood the pillory, and where now stands the market-pump."], [15, "Introduction. V is, a step-daughter \u2014 of Sir Edward North, father of the famous translator of Plutarch. The house in which Arden was murdered is still standing, and on the glass of the parlour window were once to be seen the arms of the family of the Norths. As the drama tist drew the materials for his tragedy from Holinshed's Chronicle it will be well to quote in full the chronicler's account of the murder. \"[1552. An. reg. 5.] About thys time1 there was at Feuersham in Kent a Gentleman named Arden most cruelly murthered and slaine by the procurement of hys owne wife. The which murther for the horriblenesse thereof, although otherwise, it may seeme to bee but a private matter, and therefore as it were impertinent to thys Hystorie, I have thought good to sette it foorth somewhat at large having the instructions delyvered to me by them that have used some diligence to gather the true understanding of the circumstances. Thys Arden was a manne of a talle and comelye personage, and matched in maryage with a Gentlewoman yong, tall, and well favoured of shape and counte- nance, who chauncing to fall in familiaritie with one Mosbye, a Tayler by occupation, a blacke swart man, servaunt to the Lorde North, it happened thys Mosbye upon some misliking to fall out with hir, but she being desirous to be in favour with him againe sent him a paireof silver dice by one Adam Foule, dwelling at the Floure de Lice in Feversham. After which he resorted to hir againe and oftentymes lay in k Ardens house, insomuch that withiu two years after he oliteyned such favour at hir handes, that he laye wyth her, or (as they terme it) kept hir in abusing hir bodie. And although (as it was said) Maister Arden perceyved right wel their mutuall familiaritie to be much greater than theyr honestie, yet bycause he would not offende hir, and so lose the benefite which he hoped to gaine at some of hir friendes handes in bearing with her lewdnesse, which he might have lost if he should have fallen out with hir, he was contented to winke at hir filthie disorder, and both per- mitted and also invited Mosbye verie often to lodge in his house. And thus it continued a good space before anye practise was begonne by them agaynst Maister Arden. Shee at length inflamed in love with Mosbye and loathing her husbande, wyshed and after practised the meane howe to hasten his ende. There was a Painter dwelling in Feversham who had skill of'poysons (as was reported) ; she therefore demaunded of him whether it were true that he had such skill in that feate or not, and he denyed not but that he had in deede. Yea (sayed she) but I woulde have suche a one made as shoulde have most vehement and speedie operation to dispatch the eater thereof : that can I doe (quoth hee) and forthwith made hir suche an one, and willed hir to put it into the bottom of a Porenger, and 1 It appears from the Faversham Wardmote Book (quoted in the preface to Edward Jacob's edition of Arden) that the murder was commiltei ou Sunday, 15 Febry., 1550\u20141, about seven o'clock in the evening."], [16, "Introduction. VI then after to pour Mylke upon it, which circumstance she forgetting did cleans contrary, putting in the Mylk first, and afterward the poyson. Now Maister Arden purposing that daye to ride to Canterburie, his wife brought him hys breakfast, which was wont to be mylke and butter : he having recey ved a spoonefnl or two of the Mylke mislyked the tast and colour thereof, and sayed to his wife Mistress A les what milk have you given me here ? Wherewithall she tilted it over with hir hande, sayinge, I wene nothing can please you. Then bee tooke horse and road towards Canterburie, and by the way fell into extreeme purging upwards and downwards and so escaped for that time. After this his wife fell in acquaintance with one Greene of Feversham, servant to Sir Anthony Ager, from which Green maister Arden had wrested a peece of ground outhe backside of the Abbey of Feversham, and there had blowes and great threates passed betwixt them about that matter. Therefore shee knowing that Greene hated hir husbad began to practise with him how to make him away, and con cluded that if he could get any that wold kill him, he should have ten pounds for a reward. This Greene having doings for his master Sir Anthonie Ager, had occasion to goe up to London where his maister then lay, and having some charge up with him, desired one Bradshaw a goldsmith of Feversham that was his neighbour, to accempanie him to Gravesend, and he wold content him for his paines. This Brad shaw being a verie honest man was content and roade with him, and when they came to Rainham down they chanced to see three or foure serving men that were comming from Leedes, and therewith Bradshaw espied comming up the hill from Rochester one black Will a terrible cruell ruffian with a sword and a buckler, and another with a great staffe on his necke. Then sayde Bradshawe to Greene, we are happie that here commeth some companie from Leedes, for here commeth up agaynst us as murthering a knave as any is in Enyldd, if it were not for them we might chance hardly to escape without losse of our money and lives. Yea, thought Greene (as he afterwards confessed) such a one is for my purpose, and therefore asked which is he ? Yonder is he, quoth Bradshaw, the same that hath the sword and Buckler: his name is black Will. Howe knowe you that, sayde Greene .' Brad shawe answered, I knew him at Bullonge, where we both served, he was a souldier, and I was Sir Rkhard Cavendishes man, and there he committed many robberies and heynous murders on such as trauailed betwixt Bollongne and France. By this time the other companie of serving men came to them, and they going all togither met with black Will and his fellow. The serving men knew black Will, and saluting him demaunded of him whither he went, he answered by his blood (for his use was to swear almost at every word) I know not, nor care not, but set up my staffe, and euen as it falleth I goe. If thou (quoth they) wilt go back againe to Gravesend we will give thee thy supper : by his blood (sayd he) I care not, I am content, have with you, and so he returned again with them. Then black Will took acquaintance of Bradshaw saying fellow Bradshawe how dost thou ? Bradshaw unwilling to renue acquaintance, or to have ought to doe with so shamelesse a ruffian, said, Why : do ye know me ? Yea, yt I do (quoth he) did not we serve in Bollongne togither ? But ye must pardon me (quoth Bradshaw) for I have forgotte you. The Green talked with black Will and said when ye have supped come to my hostesse house at such a signe, and I will give you the Seek and Sugar. By his"], [17, "Introduction. VII Wad (s&id he) I thank you, I wil come, and take it, I warrant you. According to his promise he came, and there they made good chere. The black Will and Green went and talked apart fro Bradshaw, and there cocluded togither that if he would kill maister Arden, he should have ten pound for his labour, then he answered, by hys wounds that I wil, if I may knowe him ; marie to morrow in Poules I will shew him thee, sayd Greene. Then they lefte their talke, and Greene bade hym goe home to his hostes bouse. Then Greene wrote a letter to mistres Arden and among other things put in these words ' we have gote a man for our purpose, we may thanke my brother Bradshaw.' Now, Bradshaw, not knowing any thing of this, toke the letter of him, and in the morning departed home agayne, and delivered the letter to Mistresse Arden, and Greene and llacke Will went up to London at the tide. At the time appoynted Greene shewed blacke Will maister A rden walking in Poules. Then sayde blacke Will, what is hee that goeth after him ? marie sayd Greene, one of his men By hys bloude, said blacke Will, I wil kil them both. Nay, said Greene, do not so, for he is of counsel with us in this matter. By his blond, sayd he, T care not for that, I will kill them both. Nay sayde Greene, in any wise do not so. Then blacke Will thought to have killed Maister Arden in Poules Church-yarde, but there were so many Gentlemen that accompanyed him to dinner, that he missed of his purpose. Greene shewed all this talke to maister Arden's man, whose name was Michael, whych ever after stoode in doubte of black Will least he should kill him. The cause that this Michael conspired with the rest against his maister was, for that it was determined that he should marrie a kinswoman of Mosbyes. After this maister Arden lay at a certaine Personage whicli he held in London, and therefore his man Michael & Greene agreed that black Will should come in and murther maister Arden. This Michael hauing his maister to bed, left open the doors according to ye appointment. His maister then being in bed asked him if he had shut fast ye dores, and he said yea : but yet afterwards, scaring least black Will would kill him as well as his maister, after hee was in bed himselfe hee rose agayne and shut the dores, bolting them fast, so that black Will comming thither, and finding the dores shutte departed being disappoynted at that time. The nexte day blacke WiU came to Greene in a greate chafe swearing and staring bycause he was so deceyved, and with many terrible othe3, threatned to kill maister Ardens man first, whereso ever he met him. No, said Greene, do not so, I will first know the cause of shut ting the dores. Then Greene met and talked with Ardens man, and asked of hym, why he did not leave ope the doors according to his promise. Marie, said Michael I will shew you the cause. My maister yesternight did that he neuer did before, for after that I was abedde he rose up and shut the dores, and in the morning rated me for leaving them unshut. And herewith Greene and black Will were pacified. Arden being ready to go homewards, his maid came to Greene and said, this night wil my maister goe downe, whereupon it was agreed that blackWill shoulde kyll him on Raynam doione. When maister A rden came to Rochester his man stil fearing yt black Will would kil him with his maister, pricked his horse of purpose, and made him to hault, to the ende he mighte protract the time and tarrie behinde, hys maister asked him why his horse halted, he sayd, I know not. Wei, quoth his maister, when ye come at the Smith here before (betwene Rochester and the hil"], [18, "Introduction. VIII foote over againste Cheetam) remove his shoe and search him, and then come after me. So maister Arden rode on and ere he came at ye place where black Will lay in waite for him, there overtooke him divers Gentleme of his acquaintace who kept him Company, so that black Will mist here also of his purpose. After yt maister Arde was come home, he sent (as he usually did) his man to Shepey to sir T/w. Cheney, then L. Warden of the Cinque Ports, about certain busines, and at his coming away hee had a letter deliuered sent by Sir Tho. Cheny to his maister. When hee came home his mistres toke the letter and kept it, willing hir man to tell his maister that he had a letter delivered him by Sir Tho. Cheny and that he had lost it : adding that he thought it best that his maister shuld goe the next morning to Sir Tho. bycause be knew not the matter : he said he would, and therefore he willed his man to be sturring betimes. In thys meane while black Will and one George Shakebag his companyon were kept in a storehouse of Sir Anthony Agers at Preston, by Greenes appoyntment, and thither came mistresse Arden to see him, bringing and seding him meate and drinke many times. He therfore lurking there and watching some opportunitie for his purpose was willed in any wise to be up earely in the morning to lie in wait for maister A rden in a certaine brome-close betwixte Feuersham and the Fery (which close he must needes passe) and there to doe his feate. Now black Will sturred in the morning betimes but hee mist the way and tarried in a wrong place. Maister A rden and his man comming on their way erely in ye morning towards Shornelan where sir Tho. Cheyny lay, as they were almost come to the brome-close, his man alwayes fearing that black Will would kill him with hys mayster, seined that he had lost his purse. Why, said his maister, thou foolish knave couldest thou not looke to thy purse, but lose it ? What was in it ? three pound, said he. Why then goe thy wayes back agayne lyke a knave, said his Maister, and seeke it, for beeing so earely as it is, there is no man sturring, and therefore thou maist be sure to find it, and then come and ouertake me at the Fery. But nevertbelesse by reason that black Will lost his way, maister Arden escaped yet once agayne. At that time black Will yet thought he should have bin sure to have met him homewardes, but whether that some of the L. Wardens men accompanyed him backe to Feuersham, or that being in doubt for that it was late, to goe through the broomye-close, and therefore tooke another way,6/ae\u00a3 Will was disappointed then also. But now St. Valentines faire being at hand the conspirators thought to dispatch their divelish intention at that tyme. Mosby minded to picke some quarrell to maister Arden at the faire to fight with him, for he sayde he could not find in his hart to murther a gentleman in that sort as his wife wished although she had made a solemne promise to him, and hee againe to hir, to be in all poynts as man and wife togither, and thereupon they both received the Sacrament one Sonday at London openly in a Church there. But this deuise to fight with hym would not serve, for maister Arden both then and at other times had bin gretly provoked by Mosby to fight with him, but hee would not. Now Mosby had a sister that dwelt in a tenement of maister Arden's neere to his house in Feversham, and on the faire even black Will was sente for to come tbyther, and Greene bringing him thyther, met there with mistres Arden acconi anyed with Michael hir man and one of hir maides. There were also Mosby and George Shakebag and there they devised to have him killed in manner as afterwards"], [19, "Introduction. IX he was, but yet Mosby at the first, woulde not agree to that cowardly murthering of him. but in a fury floog away and went up the Abbey streete towards the Flower de lice the house of the afore mentioned Adorn Foules where he did often host. But before he came thither now at this time a messenger overtook him that was sente from mistres Arden, desiring him of all loves to come backe again to help to accom plish the matter he knewe of. Heereupon he returned to hir again, and at hia comming back she fell down upon hir knees to him, and besought him to goe through with the matter, as if he loved hir he would be contented to do : sith, as she had divers time3 told him, he needed not to doubt, for there was not any that would care for his death, nor make any great inquirie for them that should dispatch him. Thus she being earnest with him at length he was contented to agree unto that horrible deuise, and thereupon they conveyed black Will onto Maister Ardens house, putting him into a closet at the end of his Parlour. Before this, they had sent out of the house all the servants, those excepted which were piivie to the devised murtber. Then went Mosbie to the door and there stood in a nightegowne of silke girded about him, and this was betwixt sixe and seven of the clocke at nighte. Maister Arden having bene at a neighbors house of his named Dumpkin, and having cleared certaine reconings betwixt them came home, and finding Mosbie standing at the dore, asked him if it were supper time. I thinke not quoth Mosby, it is not yet ready. Then lette us goe and play a game at the tables in the meane season, said maister Arden, and so they went streight into the Parlor. And as they came thorough the Hall, his wife was walking there, and master Arden said, How nowe, mistres Alesl but shee made small aunswer to him. In the meane time one cheined the wicket dore of the entrie. When they came into the Parlor, Mosby sate downe on the bench, having his face towards the place were blacke Will stoode. Then Michaell, maister Ardens man, stode at his maisters backe holding, a candell in his hande to shaddowe blacke Wil that Arden might by no meanes perceive hym comming forth. In their play Mosby said thus (which seemed to be the watch word for blacke Wills comming forth), Now may I take you, Sir, if I will. Take me, quoth maister Arden, whych way ? With that blacke Will stept forth, and cast a towell aboute his necke, so to stoppe his breath and strangle him. Then Mosby having at hys girdle a pressing iron of 14 pound weight, stroke him on the head with the same, so that he fel downe and gaue a great grone, in so much that they thought hee had bin killed. Then they bare him away to ley him in the counting house, and as they were about to ley him down, the pangs of death comming on him, he gaue a greate grone and stretched himself, and then black Wil gaue him a great gash in the face, and so killed him out of hand, laid him along, tooke the money out of his purse, aud the rings from hys fingers, and then comming out of the counting house said, Now this feate is done give me my mone3T, so mistre-s Arden gave him ten lb.: and he commyng to Grene had a horse of him, and so rode his ways. After that black Will, was gone mistress Arden came into the counting house, and with a knife gave him seven or eight pricks into the brest. Then they made clene the Parlor, tooke a clout, and wiped where it was bloudy and strewed agayn the rushes that were shuffled with strugling, and cast the clout with which they wiped the blood, and the knife that was bloudy wherewith she had wounded hir husband into a tubbe by the welles side, wher afterward both the same cloute and kni\u00e6 were founde. Thus thys wicked woman with hir"], [20, "X Introduction. curnplices most shamefully murthered hir owne husband who most entirely loved hir all his life time. Theu she sente for two Londoners to supper, the one named Prune and the other Cole, that were Grosers, which before the murder was committed were bidden to supper. When they came, she said, I marvell where maister Arden is : wel, we wil not tarie for him, come ye, and sitte downe, for he will not be long. Then Mosbye's sister was sente for, she came and sate downe, and so they were merrie. After supper, mistres Arden caused hir daughter to play on the virginals, they danced, and she with them, and so seemed to protracte time as it were, til maister Arden should come ; and she said, I marvel where he is so long, wel, hee will come auone I am sure, I pray you in the meane while let us play a game at the tables. But the Londoners said they must goe to their hostes house, or else they shuld be shut out at dores, and so taking their leave departed. When they were gone, the servants that were not privie to the murther were sent abroade into the Towne, some to seeke their maister, and some of other errands, all saving, Michael and a maid, Mosbye's sister, and one of mistresse Arden' s own daughters. Then they tooke thfi dead body and caryed it out to lay it in a field next to the Churcheyard, and joining to his garden wall, through the which he went to the Church. In the meane time it began to snowe, and when they came to the garden-gate they remembred that they had forgotten the kay, and one went in for it, and finding it, at length brought it, opened the gate, and carried the corps into the same 6eld, as it were ten paces from the garden gate, and laid him downe on his backe streight in his night gowne, with bis slippers on, and betwene one of his slippers and his foote a long rush or two remained. When they had thus laid him down, they returned the same way they came through the garden into the house. They beeyng returned thus backe againe into the house, the dores were opened and the servauntes returned home that had bin sent abrode, and being now very late she sente forthe hir folkes againe to make enquirie for him in divers places, namely amongthe best in the towne where he was wont to be, who made answere that they could tel nothing of him. Then she began to make an outcry, and said, never woman had such neighbors as I have, and herewith wepte, insomuch, that hir neighbors came in and found hir making great lamentation, pretending to marvell what was become of hir husbande : whereupon the Mayor and others came to make search for him. The faire was wont to bee kepte partly in the towne. partly in the Abbey, but Arden for his owne private lucre and covetous gaine had this present yere procured it to be wholly kepte within the Abbey ground which he had purchased, and so reaping al the gaynes to himselfe, aud bereaving the towne of that portion which was wont to come to the inhabitants, gote many a bitter curse. The Maior going about the faire in this search, at length came to the ground where Arden lay, and as it happened Prune the grosser getting sight of him first said, Stay, for methinke I see one bye heere and so they looking and beholding the body found that it was maister Arden lying there througly dead, and viewing diligently the maner of his bodv and hurtes, founde the rushes sticking in his slippers, and marking further espyed certaine footesteppes by reason of the snowe, betwixt the place wher he lay, and the garden dore. Then the Maior commanded every man to stay, and herewith appointed some to goe about, and to come in at the inner side of the house thorough the garden as the way lay to the place where maister Ardens dead body did lye,"], [21, "Introduction. XI who al the way as they came percey ved footings still before them in the snowe, and so it appeared plainly that he was brought along that way from the house through the gardeu, and so into the field where he lay. Then the Maior and his company that were with him went into the house, and knowing hir evil demeanor in times past, examined hir of the matter, but she defyed them, and said, 1 would you should know I am no such woman. Then they examined hir seruants, and in tho examination by reason of a peece of his heare and bloud founde neere to the house in the way by the whiche they caried him forth, and likewise by the knife with which she had thrust him into the brest, and the clout wherewith they wipt the blood away whiche they found in the tubbe into the which the same were throwen, they al confessed the matter, and hir seise beholding hir husbands bloud, said, Oh the bloud of God help, for this bloud have I shed. Then were they al attached and committed to prison. And the Maior with others presently went to the Flower de lice, where they found Mosby in bed ; and as they came towards him they espyed his hose and purse stayned with some of maister Ardent bloud ; and when he asked what they meant by their comming in such sort, they said, See, here ye may un derstand wherefore, by these tokens, shewing him the bloud on his hose and purse. Then he confessed the deede, and so he and al the other that had conspired the murder, were apprehended and layd in prison, excepte Greene, black Will, and the Painter, which Painter and George Shakebag that was also fledde before, were never heard of. Shortly were the Sessions kept at Feuersham where all the prisoners were arraigned and condemned. And thereupon being examined whither they had any other complices, mistres Arden accused Bradshaw uppon occasion of the letter sent by Greene fro Gravesend (as before ye have heard) which words hadde no other meaning, but only by Bradshawe's describing of black Wills qualities, Greene judged him a meete instrument for the execution of their pretended murther : whereunto notwithstanding (as Greene confessed at his death certaine yeares after) this Bradshaw was never made privie, howbeit he was uppon this accusation of mistres Arden immediately sent for the Sessions and indited, and declaration made against him, as a procurer of black WiU to kill maister Arden, which proceeded wholly by misunderstanding of the wordes conteyned in the letter which he brought from Greene. Then hee desired to talke with the persons condemned, and his request was granted : he therefore demaunded of them if they knew him, or ever had any conversation with him. and they all said no. Then the letter being shewed and redde, he declared the very trueth of the matter, and upon what occasion he told Greene of blacke Will ; neverthelesse he was condemned and suffered. These condemned persons were diversly executed in sundry places : for Michaell maister Ardens man was hanged in chaynes at Feuersham, and one of the maides was brent there, pitifully bewailing hir case, and cryed out on hir mistres that had brought hir to this ende for the whiche she would neuer forgive her. Mosby and his sister were hanged in Smithfielde at London, M istress A rden was burned at Caunlerbury the 14 of March : Greene came agayne certayne yeares after, was apprehended, condemned, and hanged in chaynes in the high way betwixt Ospringe and Boughton agaynste Feversham ; . black Will was brent on a scaffolde at Flishing in Zeland. Adam Foule that dwelt at the Floure de lice in Feuersham was brought into trouble about this matter, and caried up to London w-ith his leggs bound under the horse belly, and committed to prison in the MarshoJsea, for that Mosby was heard to"], [22, "Introduction. XII say, had it not bin for Adam. Foule I hadd not come to this trouble, meaning that the bringing of the silver dice for a token to him from mistres Arden, as ye have heard, occasioned him to renue familiaritie with hir agayne. But when the matter was througly ripped up, and that Mosby had clered him protesting that he was neuer of knowledge in any behalfe to the murther, the mans innocencie preserved him. This one thing seemeth very strange and notable touching maister Arden, that in the place where he was layd being dead, all the proportion of his body might be seene two years after and more, as playne as could be ; for the grasse did not growe where his body hadde touched, but betweene his legges, betweene bys armes and about the holowness of his necke, and round about his body : and where his legges, armes, head, or any part of his body had touched, no grasse growed at all all that time ; so that many strangers came in the meane time beside the Townesmen to see the print of his body there on the ground in that field, which fielde he hadde (as some have reported) cruelly taken from a woman that had bin a widow to one Cooke, and after married to one Richard Read a mariner, to the great hinderance of hir and hir husband the sayd Read, 'for they had long enjoyed it by a leasse whiche they had of it for many yeares not then expired : neverthelesse he got it from them, for the which the said Reade's wife not only exclaymed against him, in sheading many a salte teare, but also cursed him most bitterly even to his face, wishing many a vengeance to light upon him and that all the worlde might wonder on him : which was thought then to come to pass,wheu he was thus murthered, and lay in that fielde from midnight till the morning, and so all that day, being the fayre day, till night, all the whyche day there were many hundreds of people came wondering about hym. And thus farre touching this horrible and haynous murder of master Arden \" (pp. 1703 \u2014 8, ed. 1577). Among the archives of the city of Canterbury is preserved the hideous entry \" For the charges of brennrng Mistres Arden and execution of George Bradshaw xlih s \" (Hist. MSS. Comm., Appendix to Ninth Report, p. 154). In one important point the dramatist departed from Holinshed's narrative. Holinshed distinctly states that Arden was aware of the guilty intimacy1 that existed between his wife and Mosby ; and that 1 The writer of an article on A rden in The Monthly Journal of the Faversham Institute, August, 1881, tells us that the following statement occurs among some MS. notes found many years ago in a lumber-room at the Dolphin Inn, Faversham: \u2014 \"Arden was a gentleman bred near Wye, in Kent, and was importuned to buy the Abbey lands by Lord Cheyne, and was not aware when he bought them that several tenants had leases of different portions. He was 56 when he came to Faversham. His wife was 28, and had had familiarities with Mosbie before she was married, which made her friends desirous of marrying her with Arden.\" The writer of the MS. notes was a Mr. Burton, who states that he had procured his information from the \" auncientest people.\""], [23, "Introduction. XIII he bore with her infidelity \" bycause he would not offende hir, and so lose the benefite which he hoped to gaine at some of hir friendes handes.\" In the play Arden is represented as a weak-minded man, who suspects his wife to be disloyal, but is so completely over- mastered by his affection for her, and so cowed by her vehement protestations of innocence, that he is ready at any moment to regard his suspicions as the coinings of groundless jealousy. In the chronicle he is odious and despicable; in the play he is an object for mingled scorn and compassion. Elizabethan literature abounds in difficulties for the student ; but the question of the authorship of Arden of Feversham is, perhaps, the hardest difficulty of all. Edward Jacob, a Faversham man, who reprinted the play in 1770, boldly attributed it to Shakespeare. In support of his contention he merely produced a meagre array of parallel passages. The testimony of parallel passages is like the evidence given by experts in handwriting before a jury : it is always expected, it is always produced, and it is seldom regarded. Some of the dramatists, it is true, slipped into mannerisms, by which they may be frequently detected. Massinger, for instance, has a set of favourite phrases and turns of expression ; Shirley repeats himself again and again ; and Fletcher's metrical peculiari- ties are a tolerably sure guide. But mistakes may easily occur even where Massinger, or Shirley, or Fletcher, is the subject of discussion ; and when an attempt is made to father an anonymous play on Shakespeare, it behoves us indeed to be wary. Arden was entered in the books of the Stationers' Company on Sth April, 1592. At that early date the chief writers for the stage, omitting Shakespeare, were Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Kyd, Lyly, Nashe, Wilson, and Antony Munday. To none of these writers can Arden be assigned, with the slightest show of proba bility. Marlowe was the master-spirit among them, and his influence permeated the dramatic literature of the day ; but the author of Arden quietly pursued a course of his own, far from the throng of Marlowe's satellites. So far as I can discover, there is only one"], [24, "Introduction. XIV Marlowesque passage in the play. It is where Bradshaw gives a description of the thief who stole Lord Cheiny's plate : \u2014 \" A leane faced writhen knaue, Hauke nosde and very hollow eied, With mightye furrowes in his stormye browes ; Long haire down his shoulders curled ; His chin was bare, but on his vpper lippe A mutchado, which he wound about his eare.\" Compare with these lines the description of Pilia Borsa in the Jew of Malta : \u2014 \" He sent a shaggy tottered staring slave, That when he speaks draws out his grisly beard, And winds it twice or thrice about his ear ; Whose face has been a grindstone for men's swords,\" &c. Such a verse as \" With mightye furrowes in his stormye browes \" might have come straight out of Tamburlaine. But in no other part of the play can we find a tracs of Marlowe's influence. In general dramatic treatment Arden is totally unlike any of Mar lowe's plays.' No reader can fail to be struck by the sober self-restrained manner in which the unknown playwright has dealt with his sub ject. There is no exaggeration, no straining after effect. The writer knew precisely what he wanted to- do, and did it. In the epilogue he appeals modestly, yet confidently, to the audience : \u2014 \" Gentlemen, we hope youle pardon this naked Tragedy,' Wherein no filed points are foisted in To make it gratious to the eare or eye ; For simple trueth is gratious enough, And needes no other points of glosing stuffe.\" 1 \" The whole style of treatment from end to end,\" says Mr. Swinburne, in his Study of Shakespeare, \" is about as like the method of Marlowe as the method of Balzac is like the method of Dumas.\" * It was in imitation of the example set in Arden that the author of A Warning begged the audience in the epilogue to"], [25, "Introduction. XV We accept the apology, but it is allowable to regret that the writer thought fit to adopt a style of language so severely simple. For we feel that he could, an' he would, at any moment discard this unadorned simplicity and speak in tragic accents. In reading A Warning for Fair Women and Yarington's Two Tragedies, we see no trace of hidden force and fire ; the writers seem to be giving us of their best and to be witholding nothing.1 But the magnificent scene of the quarrel and reconciliation between Arden and Mosby \u2014 a scene infinitely finer than any scene in A Warning or 'Two Tragedies \u2014 proves that the writer of Arden, had he selected a more stately subject for his pen, could have risen to the full height of tragic dignity. But he preferred to exercise his genius on a tragedy of domestic life, following faithfully, but with a true artist's instinct, the plain and terribly graphic narrative of Holinshed. He worked in the sphere of realism, but it is realism of no vulgar type. Visions of the night and omens on the way warn Arden of his approaching doom, but with heavy heart and downcast eyes he treads the path of death. Alice, the adulteress and murderess is as one con trolled by the imperious will of a malignant destiny ; in vain she strives to escape from the toils of sin and shame, for the Fates are pitiless. Mr. Swinburne, in his Study of Shakespeare, seems to incline to the view that Arden, was written by Shakespeare.2 \" Considering,\" \" Beare with this true and home-borne Tragedy, Yielding so slender argument and scope To build a matter us importance on, And in such forme as happly you expected.\" 1 I must here withdraw a suggestion, tentatively put forward in the preface to my edition of Yarington's Two Tragedies (Old English Plays, Vol. iv., p. 2), \u2014 that Arden, A Warning, and Two Tragedies, are all by the same hand ; that A Warning and Two Tragedies, though published later, were early essays by the author, whose genius afterwards displayed itself at its highest in Arden. To this theory there is a fatal objection, as was pointed out to me by the Rev. J. W. Ebsworth and others \u2014 namely, that one of the murders with which Two Tragedies deals, is shown, by entries in the Stationers' Registers, to have been committed in 1594. ' Mr. J. A. Symonds, in Shakespeare's Predecessors, has an excellent analysis of Arden. He leaves the question of authorship open."], [26, "Introduction. XVI he remarks, \" the various and marvellous gifts displayed for the first time on our stage by the great poet, the great dramatist, the strong and subtle searcher of hearts, the just and merciful judge and painter of human passions, who gave this tragedy to the new-born literature of our drama ; taking into account the really wonderful skill, the absoluteness of intuition and inspiration with which every stroke is put in that touches off character or tones down effect, even in the sketching and grouping of such minor figures as the ruffianly hireling Black Will, the passionate artist without pity or conscience, and above all the 'unimitated inimitable' study of Michael, in whom even physical fear becomes tragic, and cowardice itself no ludicrous infirmity, but rather a terrible passion ; I cannot but finally' take heart to say, even in the absence of all external or traditional tes timony, that it seems to me not pardonable merely or permissible, but simply logical and reasonable, to set down this poem, a young man's work on the face of it. as the possible work of no man's youthful hand but Shakespeare's.\" It is with the greatest diffidence that I venture to differ from Mr. Swinburne, but I am bound to say that I cannot see on what ground Arden can be pronounced \" a young man's work.\" To me the tragedy appears to be the work of an artist writing in the full maturity- of his power. In my judg ment the straightforward unambitious style of the language, the quiet self-restrained composure of the dialogue, bears no marks of juvenility. It is hardly credible that Shakespeare at any period of his career could have adopted so bald a simplicity of diction. The versification \u2014 except in a few passages \u2014 is undoubtedly want ing in elasticity, in poetic force and fervour ; it too nearly approaches to sermo pedestris ; it is not, in a word, Shakespearean. I question whether Shakespeare, would ever have chosen the story of the mur der of Arden as a subject for a tragedy ; but, if he had made such a choice, there can be little doubt that he would have raised the argument to a higher level and invested it with the glamour of his marvellous imagination. But, even if we do not admit the theory of Shakespeare's authorship, it is in the highest degree probable that Arden was one of the plays which received correction and re vision from Shakespeare's hand. I do not for a moment suppose"], [27, "Introduction. XVII that Arden is to be identified (as some have suggested) with the old play of Murderous Michael, acted at court, in 1578. Between 1578 and 1592 a literary revolution was effected in English stage-history, and it is incredible that Arden could have been written at the ear lier date. But of course it is not necessary, in order to accept the theory of Shakespeare's revision, to believe that the play was an obsolete production. We have ample evidence to justify us in as suming that Shakespeare at the beginning of his career employed himself in revising plays of contemporary authors : and I suspect that Arden, in its present state, has been retouched here and there by the master's hand. In reading the scene of the quarrel and re conciliation between Mosbie and Alice, it is hard indeed to resist the feeling that it was Shakespeare who put into the mouth of Alice this passionate entreaty : \u2014 \" Look on me, Mosby. or Ile kill my seise ; Nothing shall hide me from thy stormy looke ; If tho a cry warre there is no peace for me. I will do penance for offending thee. And burne this prayer booke where I here vse, The holy word that had conuerted me. See, Mosbie, I will teare away the leaues, And al the leaues, and in this golden couer Shall thy sweete phrases and thy letters dwell ; And thereon will I chiefly meditate And hould no other sect but such deuotion. Wilt thou not looke ? is all thy loue ouerwhelmde ? Wilt thou not heare ? what malice stopes thine eares ? Why speaks thou not 1 what silence ties thy tongue ? Thou hast bene sighted as the eagle is, And heard as quickly as the fearefull hare, And spoke as smoothly as an orator, When I haue bid thee heare or see or speak, \u2014 And art thou sensible in none of these ? \" Occasionally we come upon single lines, or short clusters of lines, that seem to have a genuine Shakespearean flavour, for instance \u2014 \"It is not loue that loues to anger loue.\" \" A womana loue is as the lightning flame Which euen in bursting forth consumes it seise.\""], [28, "Introduction. XVIII ' ' Tntreat her faire ; sweete words are fittest engines To race the flint walles of a womans breast.\" Nothing in the play is more intensely dramatic than the in cident in the third act, where Franklin, riding towards Rainham Down with Arden, to whom he is relating a story of a disloyal wife, is assailed, as he approaches the spot where the miscreants are con cealed, by a sudden indisposition, an ominous fighting at the heart, which compels him to break off his story.1 The episode is rendered the more effective by reason of the brevity with which it is introduced : an inferior writer would not have been content to stir the reader's imagination with a vague hint of mystery, but would have sought to emphasise the situation by the addition of a multitude of details. Yet, I confess that I can see no reason for assigning (with Charles Knight) that particular incident to Shake speare's invention. Nor again can I distinguish Shakespeare's hand in that powerful scene where Michael, waiting for the murderers in the lonely silence of the night, is smitten at heart with pity for his master, and then \u2014 as he reflects that he may share his master's fate \u2014 pity passes into terror, until his agony of spirit at last forces from his lips a shrill cry which rouses the sleeping inmates. As I read that soliloquy, and turn the lines on my tongue, I am more and more convinced that the writer was not Shakespeare. 1 cannot imagine Shakespeare writing \" Whilst thou submissiue. pleading for releefe, Art mangled by their irefull instruments.\" I will confidently venture to assert that so uncouth an expres sion as irefull instruments cannot be paralleled in Shakespeare. 1 There is a somewhat similar incident in the second act of A Warning for Fair Women, where Master Sanders and John Beane are passing through a wood. Beane says to his companion : \u2014 \" 0 God. sir, I am heavy at the heart ! Good Master Sanilers, let's returne backe to Woolwich, Me thinkes I go this way against my wilL\" But Beane has some tangible cause for alarm, as he has just seen a man slip behind some bushes."], [29, "Introduction. .'\u25a0>.: Whether we agree or not that Shakespeare revised Arden, no competent reader will deny that the old play is of striking interest. One would fain trace the fortunes of the lonely artist who followed no man's guidance, but sought inspiration from \" simple truth.\" Oldys, in his annotated copy of Langbaine's Dranlatick Poets, says, \" They have the play in manuscript at Canterbury.\" I made enquiries for the manuscript at Canterbury, hoping that it might contain some notice of the author ; but the learned and courteous Registrar, Mr. Brigstocke Sheppard, believes that it has perished. All that he could find was the entry relat ing to the charges for the burning of Alice Arden. In 15901 Lord Leicester's players were performing at Faversham (J. M. Cowper's Notes from the Records of Faversham, p. 27). Perhaps Shakespeare was one of the actors, and Arden of Feversham may then have been represented for the first time. In recent years the play has been frequently acted, doubtless in Lillo's wretched version, at the Faversham Theatre.2 But wretched as is Lillo's recast of the old play, it produced on one occasion, according to Campbell, so mag netic an effect of terror on the audience that the representation had actually to be suspended. To see the noble tragedy acted in its integrity, with all its wealth of passion and poetry, would indeed be a rare and high delight. The first quarto of Arden of Feversham was printed in 1592 ; it is in black letter. There is a copy of it in the Bodleian Library, and another (wanting at the end a few leaves, which are reproduced in facsimile) in the Dyce Library at South Ken sington. Of the 1599 quarto, which is also in black letter, there is a copy in the library of His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, K.G.: it has been generously placed at my service. The third quarto, 1633, which contains at the back of the title page a woodcut representation of the murder, is not of great rarity. The textual variations in the old copies are of little account ; the play was carefully printed 1 In 1597 Lord Hundson's players were at Faversham, and perhaps Shakespeare was among them. See Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps' very interesting tract The Visits of Shakespeare's Company of Actors lo the Provincial Cities and Towns of England. (Privately printed, 1837). 2 See An Essay on the Tragedy of Arden of Feversham, 1873, p. 18, by Rev. C. E, Donne, Vicar of Faversham."], [30, "Introduction. XX (though the metrical arrangement of certain passages is uncouth) and there is little need of emendation. A fourth edition was not published until 1770, when Edward Jacob, a Favershan Antiquary, issued a careful reprint. Lillo's Arden of Feversham, posthumously published in 1762, is a feeble alteration of the original, cut to suit the taste of an eighteenth century audience. There are modern editions of the old play in Tyrrell's Doubts all Plays of Sliakespeare and Dr. Delius' Pseudo-Shakspere 'sche Dramen, Elberfeld, 1855. The ballad of The Complaint and lamentations of Mistress Arden of Feversham, preserved among the Roxburghe Ballads, is reprinted in Evans' Old Ballads, and in Miss De Vaynes'1 charming Kentish Garland. I should judge that the ballad in its present form was written about the time (1633) when the third edition of the play was issued ; but doubtless there was an older ballad on the subject. In the Roxburghe ballad is an illustration of the murder (seemingly from the same block as the illustration at the back of the title-page of the 1633 quarto of the play). It was reproduced in facsimile for the Kentish Garland by Rev. J. W. Ebsworth, Rec tor of Molash, author of a delightful volume of Cavalier Lyrics, and our greatest living master of ballad-lore. With his usual kindness he allowed me to use his facsimile illustration as a frontispiece to the present volume. l I have to thank Miss De Vaynes for a transcript of Holinshed's account of the murder and for some useful notes.
