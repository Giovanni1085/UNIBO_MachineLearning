The Reviewer of the first edition in our leading literary journal says : ' The Preface may be very well addressed to the general public, but addressed to a special class of men, as these songs of course are, they should not be so heralded.' In reply, the Author presumes to say that the Preface was addressed to the soldier for the purpose of making him acquainted with the tenor of the songs, in the hope that he would be induced to read and to sing those which are written from his own stand-point. It was also addressed to the general public, so that the civilian might know the truths conveyed in the several satires ; and the Author re- joices to find that the old proverb, viz. ' The shaft of satire, when tipped with truth, ever goes home,' has been com- pletely verified in his Whig-Radical critics. These have felt it so keenly, that, without venturing to challenge the facts stated, they have vented their puerile censure against the sarcasms aimed at their party. Others, comparing with Tyrt\u00e6us, censured those songs which reflected upon the country, implying thereby that he would not have satirised Sparta had she appointed a civilian to be her war minister, lost the services of the able-bodied through offering them but"], [12, "IV NOTE TO SECOND EDITION. a Helot's wage, and then filled the ranks with the undersized, boys, and striplings. Would Sparta have conquered under such conditions ? And can England ? Except where unavoidable, the Author has abstained from personalities. The satirist should be personal only when attacking vicious principles, these being impersonated in their exponent, as exemplified in the following song, in ' The Glitter of the Shilling,' and ' The clean contrary Way.' THE SOLDIER'S LOT. Air \u2014 ' The old English Gentleman.' A humble soldier's fate I sing, and, Cardwell, come, attend, As loud you boast that even slaves shall find our flag a friend ; Come with me to the pauper's bed, and shame that boast shall end. For on it lies the soldier who that banner did defend, And thought to win his country's love, like men of the olden time. 'Twas when rebellion's bloody stream from Merut roll'd along, And you cried out, with bated breath and with a faltering tongue, ' O, be a soldier ! fight for us ! come, join the gallant throng ! And on the rebels vengeance take who've done our honour wrong ; And we will ever grateful be, like men of the olden time.' For maidens sore insulted, and for little children slain. For mothers' mental agony, for brothers' tort'ring chain, He took revenge, he smote them down, again and yet again. And England's honour, England's flag, most nobly did sustain ; Like as the British soldier did, all in the olden time. A strong man then, but sickness grows, and want has gripp'd him fast ; The fight is fought, the empire won, the struggle overpast ; The broken soldier's cast away, as broken swords you cast, And your neglect upon his mind's a chilling, with'ring blast. Not such the British soldier's Iot, all in the olden time. Come, Cardwell ! come, and hear him rave, and hide your face in shame : ' Up, up for England ! comrades, up ! and battle for her fame ; Up, up for England ! England ! shout, till all the soul's aflame', Till all the heart is lost in love, as glory's in her name ; Up, comrades ! up, and battle on, like men of the olden time.'"], [13, "NOTE TO SECOND EDITION. V Bounties, and the privilege of re-engaging as a right, have been abolished on principle, that principle being to lighten the taxes of the wealthy by so much as can be taken from the pockets of the soldiers, who suffer exile, encounter disease, and sacrifice their energies for those very taxpayers. Mr. Cardwell is the exponent of the prin ciple, yet he is not to be blamed beyond others of his party. Still the satire would be ambiguous, were it not aimed at him. He is culpable above the rest only in as suming duties of which he, a civilian, must be ignorant, and which involve the lives of men. As he is known but as the exponent of the principles of non-pension, non-bounty, and non-purchase, the divine treasury of the country will never be enriched by the memory of his greatness. The Author trusts that his old comrades will appreciate his adoption of the lines of Curran on the title-page ; and he feels assured that none will turn from the perusal of his pages, or the refrain of his songs, a worse man or a worse soldier ; and if but few feel the glow of higher aspirations, he will have won his much-coveted reward. Dumfries, 1872."], [14, ""], [15, "PREFACE. In the Songs of the Camp and Barrack-Room, now incor- porated in this volume, the author purposely abstained from introducing anything of a party or political nature, deeming it to be the soldier's duty to eschew politics altogether. Nor did he touch on the wrongs, real or supposed, of the soldier, or on the revilings of many of our orators, pam- phleteers, and military and other writers in magazines, in their persistent cry for a better class of men. His humble endeavour and cherished ambition being to confirm the soldier in his loyalty to his Queen, his Country, and his Corps ; to enhance his courage and historic pride ; to ele- vate him in his own estimation and in that of his country ; to teach him to value his medal as a prize priceless beyond all other, and, by contrast, to lightly esteem the good-con- duct badge, which the vilest man does, and the cowardly soldier might, wear ; also to awaken in our youth a love for those perils and adventures which pertain to a soldier's life. Since its publication, however, the relations between the country and the soldier have been so altered, and the"], [16, "preface. VIII revilings persisted in, that the author has departed from his former resolution, and, without losing sight of the soldier's loyalty, has endeavoured to teach him to retort on his calumniators and to question England's boasted generosity, hoping that his voice may reach those who have the power to redress his wrongs, by replacing him on a footing, as a matter of right, with the civilians who serve the State. The calumnies are continued in such articles as ' The Philosophy of Recruiting,' in the Contemporary Review for December 1869; in the pamphlet entitled 'The British Army of 1868,' in Good Words, January 187 1, by the same author; and in the degrading epithets in the Senate-house. The altered conditions are, first, in the implied object of the recent Enlistment Act, viz. to popularise the Army, so as to give it a political life. This is confirmed by the Secretary of State, who said, when introducing it, ' I look forward to seeing the broad line of demarcation between the Army and civil life in some way diminished.' This is but a repetition of the language of his mentor in Army reform \u2014 the author of the above-named pamphlet. Yet he has not the moral courage to propound such a comprehensive scheme as in Prussia, where the gentleman, the man of education and position, march side by side with the mechanic and the peasant, giving a lofty tone of patriotism to the whole. Nor dare he do so, as it would ruin the popularity of his party and his own individually. Nor dare he even say to the well-to-do classes, ' If you do not yourselves submit to instruction and discipline for a time, so as to fit you"], [17, "preface. IX to redress your country's wrongs and to defend your hearth and all that you cherish, you must act liberally to those who do this for you.' Instead, he panders still more to the well-to-do classes by remitting a tax at the expense of the rank and file, and then mockingly appeals to the youth of that class from which the Army is recruited, to offer the highest sacrifice demanded by patriotism, whilst he gives back to others the superabundance of their mint and cummin. If our soldiers are to be imbued with politics, they will undoubtedly seek the franchise, and exercise it ; therefore it is to their interest to know that the Liberal party, to them, is the most illiberal, and consequently not their friend. But we may ask, is it wise, is it not rather suicidal, this removing of the line of demarcation, recruited as our army is and ever must be under the voluntary system ? Secondly, the soldier is now deprived of the right or the privilege to re-engage after twelve years, so as to complete twenty-one years' service, and thus obtain a pension \u2014 the Secretary of State declaring that he has no claim to such re-engagement. This, too, with the full knowledge, through parliamentary and other returns, that a regiment arriving in India one thousand strong will in ten years \u2014 the allotted time to serve there \u2014 lose by death five hundred and fifty ; also that not more than one man in fourteen of those who enlist lives and serves twenty-one years so as to obtain it. Whilst claiming to be a rich, great, and generous people, we destroy the hope of all our soldiers, and deter men from enlisting for the sake of depriving each fourteenth man of a few pence a day in his old age. The pension now paid"], [18, "preface. X and to which he would be entitled is, through the difference in the value of money and as compared with the shilling a day of his comrade of former years, only sixpence. Again, all men discharged at twenty-one years' service up to 1854 received one shilling a day ; from thence to 1867 only eiglirpence. Yet, notwithstanding this great reduction, there was no recognition of the soldier's services for recon quering India, as after Waterloo, by a gratuity of two years' service towards pension, or by extra pay. On the contrary, in the six years ending 1866, the seventy-nine thousand men serving within the United Kingdom paid for the common necessaries of life \u2014 over and above what it cost the army of 1844 \u2014 the enormous sum of one million, six hundred and twenty-nine thousand, three hundred, and eighty-two pounds .-* or two hundred and seventy-one thousand, five hundred and sixty-two pounds a year ; all of which went into the pockets of the general community. Thirdly, the men are now enlisted for ' General Service, instead of being allowed to choose their regiments. The term 'general service' is an unfortunate one, as formerly a man was sentenced to general service by court martial, as a punishment. The general-service regiments, in contradis tinction to those serving within the United Kingdom, served almost, if not continuously, in the East or West Indies or some other foreign station, and were, by tradition at least, called condemned regiments \u2022 the incorrigibles of the home army being sent into them as a punishment. This tradition * Vide Lecture by the author in the Royal United Service Institution Journal, delivered February 1, 1867."], [19, "PREFACE. XI has apparently been handed down by the old veterans, as those ominous words have deterred many young men from enlisting, even after having made up their minds to do so and applying to the recruiting sergeant. Hence one cause of our late want of success in raising men. It will, however, bring its own cure. Every regiment has its history \u2014 the tradition of its fame. That of a few may be known in some districts far better than others, and young men naturally wish to join a corps of which they know something. Haply they have heard that the Royal Dragoons took a crescent at Tangiers, and an eagle at Waterloo ; that the 8th Hussars rode at Balaclava ; that the 32d bear 'Lucknow' on their colours for its gallan try; that the Fusiliers fought at Inkerman or the Alma; or they may have an acquaintance in the Rifles. That they cannot join the regiment of their choice, is a sore disap pointment to many ; but the great hardship lies in this : that, after being attached to one regiment for twelve or four teen months, a man may be ordered off to another : thus wantonly outraging all friendly feelings, and destroying that historic pride which is the very life of a regiment. Young men on joining the army leave their homes and all those who are dear to them, and enter upon a new life where all are strangers. The recruits naturally draw to each other; some will be in the same squad and in the same class at drill, will mess together, and live and sleep in the same room. In a few months they will be dismissed to their duty, and be (or should be) allowed to choose their own comrade, that is, their particular friend. The two will then sleep in"], [20, "XII PREFACE. adjoining berths, answer for each other's kits and interests during absence, lend a helping hand when pushed for time, share in joys and sorrows, counsel each other in difficulties, and in the absence of all home friends be as brothers. This is no exaggerated picture, as the Author, from his own know ledge and experience, can testify. Yet such friends are to be ruthlessly separated : the more heartless, as there is no necessity for such a measure, volunteers being always ready when called for. Fourthly, the bounty, or earnest-money in bargaining for life and limb, is no longer to be paid ; but, as an equivalent, the good-conduct pay, if merited, is to commence at two instead of three, and at six instead of eight years.

GOOD-CONDUCT REGULATIONS. By these regulations all breaches of discipline must be re corded ; and if for the offence committed the soldier is awarded more than six days' drill with confinement to barracks, it affects his good -conduct pay ; either depriving him of it for twelve months, or deferring its receipt for twelve, or, possibly, for twenty-two months, as recorded below. They were designed to restrain, by the bribe of extra pay, the drunkard and the absentee ; the very men who would rejoice in extra pay could they get it, but who never try and never hope to get it : they are kept in order, as they ever have been, solely by the power vested in the commanding officer. The amount of pension, too, for length of service is made to hinge upon these regu lations. I will endeavour to show their working more in detail. Two men of eleven years and ten months' service (one with two rings, and about to get a third, the other with none) commit similar offences, and are, as a matter of course, sentenced to similar punishments \u2014 say ten days' confinement to barracks. Here the punishments awarded by the commander are alike ; but the amount (of the punishment) carries with it, to the man with the good-conduct rings the loss of, and of deferred good conduct pay, four pounds odd. The rule holds good with a man of five years and ten months' service. As it is the amount of punishment, and not the nature or seriousness of the offence, which entails the loss of pay, nothing can act more capriciously. Colonels are not always in command,"], [348, "324 APPENDIX. nor always in the same mood ; the regiment may be going on well or indifferently ; majors and captains are often in tempo rary charge ; all may have different views, and estimate offences against discipline accordingly, affecting the loss or retention of good-conduct pay. Or six men of as many regiments in the same camp may commit similar offences, yet may get as many different sentences, some losing pay, and some not. In the above case the two men were punished alike by their commanding officer, to support the discipline of his corps ; but then the regulations step in, and say to the man with the rings, ' Now, just because you have behaved well for eleven years, I will fine you far beyond the amount of your bounty ; I will shame you before your comrades by taking from you the mark osgood behaviour ; humiliate you by proclaiming your disgrace in the orders of the regiment ; and further, make your loss as irritating and protracted as possible.' The man who does his duty properly (the defaulters' book, and not a ready cheerful obedience to orders, nor even gallant conduct, being the standard) for six years is considered worth by the State, and is paid, one shilling and fivepence a day ; whilst the man who is supposed to give his officers a little more trouble, although he may wear the medal for bravery, gets only one shilling and threepence, the regular pay. Thus he is fined, indirectly perhaps, three pounds a year, although his comrade with the rings may have more minor offences recorded against him. Justice and reason would fix the pay at what the faithful fighting soldier deserves ; and then, to strengthen the hands of the commanding officer, allow him, and not any extraneous power, to fine for drunkenness, absence, and one or two other offences, until the man's pay is reduced to his bare messing ; the duration of the stoppage, for the same offence, not to ex ceed one month. It is the certainty, and not the severity or protractedness, of punishments which strengthens the hand of discipline ; men will resist the one, and be bitterly soured in their tempers by the other. Perhaps nothing has tended so much to loosen the disci pline of our army as the ' domestic economy' founded upon the good -conduct regulations : it has not only tied the hands of the commanding officer, but converted the captains into mere ciphers, who can now neither reward nor punish their men, however much they may require reward or punishment ; nor have they that deference paid to them that the sergeant-major of a troop had forty years ago."], [349, "APPENDIX. 325 II.

The men, though not now bribed with money, are beguiled by promises which may never be realised : nor are they appar ently intended to be, as the following imaginary dialogue will show : Adjutant-General [very invitingly in his recruiting notices .

When we compare the remarks made by the Secretary of State during the debates on the Army Estimates last year, on the Enlistment Act, and the clauses of the act itself, with the recruiting notice which is placarded all over the country, we are amazed at the depth of the duplicity displayed, and at the bold effrontery of statements made under the semblance of sincerity. They would make Sir C. Trevelyan's ' Sergeant Kite with ribbons and lies' blush. They but perpetuate that reproach which Mr. * The sum now allowed to a man for twelve years' service."], [350, "326 APPENDIX. Secretary Cardwell would impress upon Parliament, with such seeming virtuous self-gratulation, he was obliterating, by doing away with bounties. His words were : ' We remember how often and how justly the reproach was made against us, \"You don't resort to conscription, but you do to fraud, to obtain recruits.\" ' And he boasted very lately that he had raised 20,000 men with out bounties ; yet will any honest man say that they were raised without fraud ? III. ' THE SOLDIER YOUR SOLE QUARRY HITHERTO, The persistency with which some writers pursue our soldiers is exemplified in Sir C. Trevelyan, who sneers at their poverty when enlisting, strips them of every virtue after they have served seven years, holds them up to scorn as walking pests, and then quotes only one line of figures from a statistical return, so as to leave a false impression on the public mind. This slander of so many brave and deserving men is most culpable, even if made through ignorance, by one who writes so pretentiously of the army ; and if through design, to prop the theory of short enlistments and of democratising the army, is dishonest. The following is the return, taken from the Report of Military Prisons for 1865, from which the line of figures is selected, and which is chosen to prove that there was a great increase of crime in 1 865, and that because there were only 335 men between seven and fourteen years' service imprisoned in 1859, and 2167 in 1865, that men of that service were far worse behaved, and were demoralising the younger men. Now, is it honest to quote thus, when the other portions of the return directly falsify it? True, there were only 335 men between seven and fourteen years ; yet there were 5864 under seven years' service. Nothing, however, is said of this disparity ; nor that the per-centage (shown on the same page of the Report) Services. 1856 2yrs. & under 4,139 Under 7 yrs. 1,255 From 7 to 14 . 729 \u201e 14 \u201e 21 . 234 Above 21 . . 19 6,376 1857 1,958 2,746 663 194 11 5,572 1858 3,727 2,226 370 158 7 6,488 1859 4,154 1,710 335 137 12 6,348 1860 3,524 2,627 398 153 17 6,719 1S61 2,418 2,939 577 173 17 6,124 1,260 2,922 935 206 18 5,341 1862 18>!3 lf-64 1,100 1,209 3,158 2,727 1,194 1,325 196 190 18 19 5,666 5,470 1S65 1,616 2,327 2,166 255 26 6,390"], [351, "APPENDIX. 327 in confinement to the force was less in 1865 than in the two preceding years ; nor that the average length of sentences was less ; nor that five-sixths of the commitments were of men under thirty years of age ; nor that the commitments for de sertion and absence without leave were 4200 in 1859 against 3074 in 1865 ; nor that the increase of the commitments for drunkenness was occasioned (as stated in the Report) through soldiers formerly dealt with summarily by their commanding officers being tried by court-martial and sent to prison. It may well be asked, why were not these favourable phases in the conduct of the old soldier also made known ? Until it is con tradicted, we can only suppose that they were hid through fear that this knowledge would militate against the short-service and democratising hobby, on which the overreaching Enlistment Act of 1870 was based. The conclusion that the unprejudiced mind must come to after studying the Report is, that the soldier after seven years is better behaved, and that the army is a reclaiming school, and not a demoralising one, as Sir Charles so laboriously and wrong fully endeavours to prove. I will now explain the cause of the discrepancy in the num ber of men imprisoned between seven and fourteen years' service in the years 1859 and 1865. The effective strength of our rank-and-file in 1854 was 122,464 ; and if we take from these all who fell in the Crimea and during the Mutiny, and who were invalided and discharged, together with those remaining in India and the Colonies, we shall find that we had very few men at home in 1859 under seven years' service, to be imprisoned; whilst in 1865, many thousands of the tens of thousands who had enlisted since 1854 had completed their seven years' service, the men under seven years consequently being less. Still the average crime for the ten years remained about the same, as shown by the Return. The comparison of the Report with the harrowing conclu sions drawn from it will be another proof to the reader, that the less some writers know of their subject, the more presumingly they write. \u2666 THE END.
