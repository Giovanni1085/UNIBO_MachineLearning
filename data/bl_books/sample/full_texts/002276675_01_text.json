The spectacle apparent of two civilisations \u2014 Past and Present, the living and the dead \u2014 may move the wonder in which it is said philosophy begins. Interesting as an object of speculative science, and still more attractive from recent discoveries, it has a high claim to a more anxious scrutiny on the ground of its present and public importance. If at all seasons 'Shepherds of people had need know the kalendar of tempests of state,' this is least of all a time to dispense with the knowledge ' which suiteth best special occasions.' In the midst of movements urgently impressive \u2014 in a position the offspring and parent of change, the need, which comparison serves, is imperative, to seek into the cause and consequence of Revolu tion. How then may we approach considerations of this magnitude, premising that the correctness of the method employed is the sole guarantee of truth in our conclusions? If we seek to scan"], [14, "6 separately each revolution, the labour is endless and hopeless of result. If we select such only as show a patent resemblance or analogy, we limit, on the other hand, the scope of our inquiry. We hazard furthermore its indefinite failure in thus interrogating History piecemeal, whose answers to such half questions, like the scattered leaves of the Sibyl, are doubtful fragments of a dismembered truth. We must seek, then, by other means, a fuller and more definite response. Not contenting ourselves with the minute inspection of isolated facts, let us connect them with the series in which they occur, or the system of which they are part. We shall then have the grounds of an intelligible hypothesis ; and grouping events according to their appropriate relations, we may draw our conclusions from their united aspect. True it is, that, dealing with facts in historical sequence, it is impossible to class separately as cause and effect, events which will be found to alternate as either, according as they are referred to the change which comes after or that which precedes them. Yet we do not fail in comprising a series of changes, and tracing their subordination to some common element, to comprehend fully their individual significance. Their aggregate illustrates their several importance \u2014 while thus only do we rise to the ' reA\u00aboVar0;> re'Aoj' 0f historical inquiry, which, strictly speaking, is not so much 'the"], [15, "7 vicissitudes of institutions, social, political, and religious,'1 as the ideas which institutions and their vicissitudes express; the laws, in fact, of their being and development, in measuring which we discern the proportions of History in all their harmony, simplicity, and truth. Thus methodising, we elevate History to a science, and are able to classify its laws according as they are transitory or permanent, local or universal. We see the difference in the changes which spring from the spontaneous movement of nations within the range accorded to their free volition, and those which are attributable to a higher power, defining and limiting the conditions of their progress. Revolu tions are no longer assumed to be the result of accident, of characters and circumstances in for tuitous combination. They are seen to proceed from certain definite functions of national life, to be the voluntary product of a free and conscious agency in political society ; yet, in their impulse, succession, and later result, to be a part of the Divine scheme which orders the universe. I. \u2014 In high relation to the Eternal purpose we place the primary law of History, that nations proceed in a course of Development, their later manifestations being potentially present in the earliest constituent elements of their existence. See Dr. Arnold's Lectures on modern History, p. 157."], [16, "8 The first impulse of national life prolonged into all its subsequent history may be likened indeed to constitutional capacity and inclination, whence proceed individual conduct and action. The changes which nations experience are modified by the nature of the elements they comprise at their birth ; so that, estimating the revolutions of distinct periods, we may best ascertain how they differ if we detect the elements peculiar to each, and com pare them together in their chief combinations. II. \u2014 At the same time, if we admit a resemblance in revolutions, and a certain affinity is clearly dis cernible, we may not attribute this to a law which always produces varied results, according to the elements upon which it operates. We must refer it to some other law independent of national characteristics, which strives to accommodate their diversities to the strict measure of its own uniformity, a law which works by the side of Development, and turns its issues to a separate account. Such a law can we fail to recognise in the tendency toEquality evident throughout history, the tendency which modern research pronounces to be the plainest and gravest fact it encounters the most ancient as well as the most endurino impulse of the many movements which agitate society.1 This tendency Aristotle partially appre- See De Tocqueville, Introd., p. 3."], [17, "9 hends, asserting the cause of revolutions to be to avierov. \" iravra %ov yap bib, to avurov 17 araais oAcos yap to tcrov \u00a3r]TovvTes o-Tacria_~ovo-i.\" lhe nature of the equality sought will vary according to the peculiar circumstances of nations, referring indifferently to privileges of rank or religion or race, to rights civil or political; but some mode or shape of inequality, and that which for the time is felt to be oppressive, is the cause, as a corresponding equality is the result, of all change which is revo lution. III. \u2014 Consciously as man is seen striving to depress others or elevate himself, his movement is confined within certain limits, and made sub ject to certain positive restrictions. It can only proceed by consecutive stages, each designating an epoch in the history of nations, not such as is measured by mere lapse of time, but such as is sooner or later identical with their transition from one state of being to another. Thus, the contest for the equalisation of nobility and wealth is prior to the contest between wealth and num bers.2 The one belongs to an earlier, the other to a later, age of national existence, and it is as improbable that their order should be transposed, as that youth should be competent to man's Politics, book 5, cap. 1. 2 See Arnold's Thucyd., vol. i., Appendix I."], [18, "10 exertions, or manhood entertain the emotions of youth. Of the earlier contest, that in which property is the assailant of birth, the modern, like the ancient world, has witnessed the comple tion. In both cases was it characterised by the same phenomena, and finally attended with the same result. It is thus observable that in neither instance was it a momentary event or crisis which perfected at once the whole revolution. In Athens, the legislation of Draco, of Solon, of Clisthenes, mark the slow stages by which it was accom plished. The code of Draco, the first written definition of hereditary privilege \u2014 the \"Seisac theia\" of Solon, promoting diffusion of property \u2014 his apportionment of political rights to the gradations of his Census \u2014 the abolition by Clis thenes of the ancient Phyl\u00e6, with the distinctions which these comprehended \u2014 the facilities he offered to naturalisation, and his somewhat later establishment of Ostracism, are the legislative settlement of the successive issues which property and nobility realised in their struggle to attain the footing of a perfect equality. No less marked and graduated was the long series of political contests between the Plebs and Populus of ancient Rome; or, again, in the rise of the Commons through the middle ages, the growth of their boroughs in wealth and consideration \u2014 their suc cessive incorporations \u2014 the extension of their"], [19, "11 Charters \u2014 their advance from a state of passive immunity to an active participation in political power, by means of their representatives in the great Council of the nation. Change is seen draw ing on change in a kind of necessary sequence, and though the duration of the conflict has been in some cases protracted, sooner or later it ended in all. It ended as invariably in the ascendancy of wealth,\u2014 property instead of privilege becoming the measure in the distribution of political fran chise and power. Yet in this revolution, itself only an impulse of the grander movement towards general equality, there were intermediate stages following each other in a certain regular order and succession. Civil equality is observed almost invariably pre ceding and antedating political. In other words, the recognition of a right to an equal administra tion of existing laws was prior to a share in the power which enacts them. Thus, we find the Roman Plebs enjoying a civil equality with the Populus, before the Comitia Centuriata of Servius admitted them to a share in the government of the state.1 Subsequently, when the constitution of Servius had been overthrown, and by the pressure of the laws relating to debt the Com- mons were again reduced to dependency, the secession to the Mons Sacer virtually recovered See Arnold's Rome, vol. i., p. 27, &c."], [20, "12 for them civil equality, long before the passing of the Publilian laws terminated the struggles which secured them political.1 Thus, the emancipation of the Serfs in the middle ages preceded their admission to the rights of citizenship in the boroughs to which they flocked for protection. A half century elapsed between Magna Charta, the guarantee of civil rights to all classes of freemen, and the first summoning of representa tives for cities and boroughs to Simon de Mont ford's parliament of Oxford.2 Nevertheless, this succession has been occasionally interrupted by circumstances which prove the rule from its ex ceptions. Extraordinary conjunctures \u2014 political evils, long endured and late corrected, have exhi bited the movement, as in the efforts of Valerius and Licinius at Rome,3 or the Florentine revolu tion of 1378,4 proceeding simultaneously under both its aspects. The necessity of strengthening a frontier outpost or colonial settlement, such perhaps as Heraclea,5 or the towns of Leon and Castile taken from the Moors,6 may have intro duced at once a high degree both of civil and 1 Arnold's Rome, vol. i., p. 147 ; vol. ii., p. 158. 2 See Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. ii., p. 108, 148.

But in all ordinary aspects of history, and these declare best its highest truths, movement is seen in successive stages, organised and accommodated to conditions of progress. Yet although we may trace the tendency to equality as existing under a like form in ancient and modern History, we arrive at a limit preclud ing a perfect comparison. Investigation ceases where facts are wanting, and the European world has not yet supplied the facts necessary to illus trate the contest which follows the concluded struggle between property and birth. The ancient world fully accomplished a revolution which the modern is only in its turn approaching. Like its precursor, this contest in almost all the states of antiquity exhibited certain characteristic features. It was commonly sudden \u2014 terrible \u2014 convulsive \u2014 coincident with deeper moral depravity, and a more ferocious recklessness in the contending parties. Above all, we are told that in no known instance did it terminate favourably for the public good.1 The source of this difference from the earlier contest is thus revealed to us by the same Authority. While in the one case the contending parties approached each other as the Commons grew daily in wealth and intelligence, their conse quent assimilation in sentiment and interest, and the ultimate absence of all real disparity, facili- Arnold's Thucyd., vol. i., Appendix I., p. 633."], [22, "14 tated the removal of factitious distinctions. The ascendancy of birth passed into the ascendancy of wealth by easy and natural transitions. It was accompanied comparatively with so little violence, that inquiry may be at times perplexed in ancient or modern history to fix upon any definite period as the moment of its final consummation. On the other hand, the aspect of the contest between wealth and numbers suggests not the same gradu- ated scale by which the one might ascend to the level of the other. It is a warfare between ex- tremes of the most opposite nature, with few points of contact to attach sympathy or induce a mutual intelligence or good-will. The prospect of violent collision increases the more the interval between them is widened ; and not forewarned by previous approximation, it becomes the more desperate from their estrangement. The characteristics of this contest in the ancient world were exhibited in the proscriptions of Marius and Sylla, or the bloody factions of the Peloponnesian war ; while modern history, if we except the momentary fury of the French Revolution, has not yet produced its parallel examples. We may see such, indeed, threatening our future, and the extremes of indigence and wealth around us, with the convulsive heavings of the masses at our feet, may serve, perhaps, to quicken apprehension ; but it remains to be ceen if the modern world may entertain no hope of"], [23, "15 bettering their conclusions. Of this we may be certain, its confidence should not rest on the possi ble relaxation of what seems to be throughout History an inevitable law. The tendency to Equality must proceed. The stream of History will roll towards the plain. If there is a promise for modern civilisation, it must seek its assurance in the main source of all other difference between ourselves and antiquity, the elements which entered either civilisation. These are indisputably the germs of life \u2014 the vital essence of their respective systems; and it is only by measuring their strength, with the circumstances of their development in time and place, that we can calculate the variations in political movement, or the possible difference in its final result. IV. \u2014 For the sake of convenience we are forced to accept the commonly recognised division of History. Yet we must guard against the miscon ception into which we may be led by its arbitrary separation into Ancient and Modern at the epoch of the dissolution of the Roman empire, as if that were a point at which all existing institutions were swept away, and an entirely new order of things established in their place. There was in fact no such severance of the historic unity, no such marked separation of the old world from the new. Civilisation needed not to commence its"], [24, "16 career, to repeat the course it had already run. Though much was then destroyed which time had ripened to a merited destruction, the inner princi- ple of ancient life, the spring and source of its historic worth, like the olive of the Acropolis un- scathed by the fire, remained to put forth vigorous shoots under a more propitious culture. The ma jesty of the Imperial name survived the overthrow of the Imperial power, and awed and impressed its barbarian invaders. The Municipal system which the centralising force of Rome bound in a net-work of administrative dependence remained when the bond which constrained it was broken. The towns themselves were not destroyed though they ceased to constitute an aggregate unity, and the idea of Empire, the idea of Municipality, enter- ed at once the new combination.1 All which was superadded to them then was a new religion and an untried race. From their introduction alone was imparted fresh vigour to a system otherwise exhausted. Race \u2014 Religion \u2014 Empire \u2014 the Muni- cipal spirit, sole elements of our modern civilisa- tion, these are the four \" Which in quaternion run, And mix and nourish all things.\" From these, as subject to the law of development, comes our chief likeness or unlikeness to antiquity. See Guizot's Hist, de la Civilisation en Europe, Lee. ii."], [25, "17 From the two former, and the appropriate dis tinctions they include, the main aspects of differ ence in all our revolutions. From temperament of Race\u2014 the barbarian germ alone \u2014 how wide an aftergrowth expands in his tory. From their earliest proportions, as depicted by C\u00e6sar and Tacitus, how vast is the shadow cast into the future. A love of liberty \u2014 a sense of per sonal independence actuating the countrymen of Arminius and Civilis was developed through the descending line of their posterity. Amid the marshes and pine-forests of Germany \u2014 in their earliest European settlements \u2014 through their latest constitutional changes \u2014 under various aspects, it modified their system, and has been their charac teristic from that day to our own. In no respect did the northern races, the Celts and the Teutons, differ more remarkably from Classic nations than in the readiness with which the latter could sacri fice their liberty to their eager desire for political organization. When Aristotle asserted that the notion of a state was antecedent to that of an individual, x he was merely giving philosophic ex pression to a natural sentiment of the Greek mind. To the Greek's lively and social temperament airdpKeia \u2014 independence \u2014 was the greatest of evils; 1 Politics, bk. i., chap. 2. See also Hermann's Political Antiquities of Greece, p. 97.

Thus he had no regard for individual rights as opposed to the state. He never discussed their origin or extent, or treated them as having a sub stantive existence.2 On the contrary, he acquiesced in the state's interference with his personal liberty less reservedly than his Persian enemies submit ted to every caprice of their king.3 What conse quences, on the other hand, have followed the oppo site tendency of the Northern ! Prizing above all things his personal independence, History repre sents him as only overcoming by degrees his natural repugnance to political connexion. For a time he appears in direct antagonism to the ne cessity of government, seemingly unwilling to sacrifice any portion of his individual will for a common purpose or united effort. He is thus seen rudely subverting the systems which the genius of Pepin and Otho had constructed, and relapsing into anarchy under the later Carlovingians and the Salic descendants of Conrad.

Two consequences have followed this peculiarity of race besides a greater individual freedom, neither of which was adequately comprehended in anti quity.

From a spirit apparently anti-social, social impulses were quickened into life; and the national fire, no 1 See Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. i., p. 404 ; Spain, chap. iv. - See Koch's Revolutions of Europe, p. 49, Lond. 1839. c2"], [28, "20 longer confined to Prytaneiums and Hearths of Vesta, might hence defy the possibility of extinc tion in its distribution on domestic altars. On the other hand, out of the liking for liberty grew the respect for Law, since Law was made the instru ment of its preservation. Herein we recognise the origin of that regard which legislation has shown for the \" Rights of Persons,\" as well as those feel ings of veneration for law with which individuals have repaid the obligation. We see the anxiety to withdraw its ministers from all sinister influ ences and embarassments \u2014 the early separation of the judicial from the executive power, a separation unknown to the ancient Greek 1 \u2014 the elevation of its judges above bias or temptation, and the sig nificance of their robes of spotless ermine.

And we see the result of this circumspection as distinguished from the crude legislation of antiquity, comparing the spirit which 1 Hermann's Political Antiquities of Greece, p. 102, and references. * See Stephen on Pleading, passim. 3 The Greeks had nothing answering to our Law of Evidence see Mailer's Dorians, vol.ii., p. 230."], [29, "21 could acquiesce in the trial of the Athenian com manders at Arginus\u00e6, with the execration which has followed the execution of Byng1 \u2014 the popular indifference to the condemnation of Socrates,2 with the zeal which would \" leave the sentence against Sydney to blacken in the sight, like the hand-writ ing on the wall before the eastern tyrant, to deter posterity from outrages upon justice.\"3 Lastly, we see in their widest divergence these opposite im pulses of distinct races \u2014 public opinion in the one indifferent to constitutional form \u2014 extemporising law at its need in the tumults of the Forum, or the Psephisms of the Agora ; 4 on the other hand, the caution \u2014 the grave deliberation preceding an Act of settlement, in the crisis even of a revolution 5\u2014 the reverence for law as the safeguard of liberty which encircles its palladium in a dense forest of prescript and precedent, and adjudges it treason in all who on any pretext dare break the inclosure, or rashly violate the sacred precinct. 1 See the terms in which Smollett speaks of this transaction. 2 Even the votes of the judges on his trial were equally divided on the question of his condemnation.

It sacrificed neither the variety nor fecundity of its elements in the indisposition of individuality to merge in society. Its great men were conse quently more numerous, asserted a higher inde pendence of thought and action, made a deeper impression upon their respective generations. On the other hand, the attachment of man lo man, also a characteristic of the northern races, exhibited in the connexion of the free warriors with their earliest military chieftains in Germany,1 com batted and corrected the mischievous tendencies of a too sensitive love of liberty. Connecting itself with the tenure of land, this sentiment cemented the Feudal system.

The apt reliance upon personal exertion inducing, as we have seen, a limited view of the ends and offices of the state, combined with this spirit of free association, to work effects which the political machinery of Greece and Rome could never compass. Though the latter had also their voluntary Leagues, these were almost exclusively devoted to the purposes of faction. The \" idem velle atque idem nolle \" was, in this respect, a bond of union equally in the days of Mirabeau and C\u00e6sar.

Appealing solely to intellec tual capacity it left out of its purview the mass of mankind, whom Christianity, approaching by the avenue of their affections, is enabled to hold in a common adoption. Again, as compared with ancient Paganism, we have only to regard the severe application of its dogmas to precept \u2014 of truths eternal and divine to the moral nature and habits of man. In this respect the Heathen"], [34, "26 mythology was all but powerless. It gratified the taste, it impressed the imagination, but it failed signally to instruct the conscience. With no definite system of rewards and punishments, and suggesting no higher notions of Deity than as a being from whom oracles and arts of divination might wrest the knowledge of man's earthly interests, it could not be expected to supply in- ducements \u2014 to prescribe and regulate motives of action. Inefficient in private, it was inapplicable to public life, and national transactions were speedily released from what their promoters judged right- ly an inconvenient interference.

The later age of Europe, it is true, may not be in this respect free from reproach ; it may parallel, for instance, the boast of Agesilaus, that the frontiers of Sparta were limited by his spear ; but the same period in the ancient world exhibits no statesman pro- testing against his country's aggression.1 It is in 1 Such, for instance, as that exemplified in the speeches of Lord Ash ley on the Chinese war and Ameers of Scinde."], [35, "27 relation to the fact of comparative advancement that the shameless assertions of the Melian con troversy1 darken beside the language of the Holy Alliance, admitting in a formal state document ' the command of Scripture to brotherly love, the duty of kings to govern their subjects as parents \u2014 to maintain religion, justice, and truth.2 Though Christianity may be often overlooked, from its unobtrusive as well as its expanded agency, it nevertheless mingles in the politics of this age by maintaining its hold on public opinion. Receding in time, we find it taking part in popular movement and public administration, through the medium of its influence upon individual character. Thus, we discern its intervention through a mo narch like St. Louis \u2014 a minister like Sully \u2014 a subject such as Coligni or the good Lord Capel. In the midst of civil dissensions it is heard crying \"Peace, peace\" with Falkland. Under circum stances even the least favourable to its impressions it is interested and active for public tranquillity. Thus, it is remarked, modern despotism has rarely inflamed civil discord with the frightful excesses of the ancient Tyranny.3 Though claiming the sanction of a Divine right, and haughtily refusing to be accountable to man, it owned a responsibility 1 See Thucyd., book v., especially chaps. 89, 105. 2 See Heeren's European States System, vol. ii,, p. 441. 3 Arnold's Rome, vol. i., p. 476."], [36, "28 as the Vicegerent of Heaven, which has often restrained it from abusing its power.

As a society only possessed of a distinct government and organisation was it capable of contributing a direct force towards the sum of political movement.

It was forced into the position of a distinct society by Doctrines which required a common assent ; Precepts which needed the obliga tion of a law ; Promises which called for a wide dissemination. As a society, it was bound to de termine its relations with other societies existing at its side, and hence it became a political element colluding or clashing with other elements, as these assisted or thwarted its object.

The same elements of race and religion which are incorporated in the latter had no place or account in the former.

In the \" Gens\" and \" Phratria\" the primitive and elemental forms of ancient society, there was a kind of union cemented, as far as we know, by a distinguishing worship and peculiar rites. But the Gens and Phratria were integral parts of the body politic \u2014 holding to the State a fixed relation, which they transmitted in the shape of political rights to each indi vidual member. The tie which united them was not, as in Feudalism and the Clans, a purely personal one, irres pective of, and often paramount to, all other obligations. Nor was the sentiment of Loyalty adequately felt or appre ciated in antiquity. The Greek historian (see Herod. viii. 119) relates the story of the self-sacrifice of the Persian nobles, to preserve the life of Xerxes, with the same incredulity with which the Burghers of Carlisle are represented as receiving a like exhibition of devotedness from the humble clansman of Mac-Ivor. \u2014 See Sir Walter Scott's \" Waverley.'\" lOKnON* BRADBURY /NO BVANS, PRINTKRS, WHITKTRlARS."], [61, "ALBEMARLE STREET, May, 1815.
