THE Sea has washed along the shores of many a dead and dying empire before and since the Greek poet spoke of \" the multitudinous laughter of the ocean waves.\" The galleys of young nations have sailed over it to triumph and domination ; the armadas of tottering kingdoms have been engulfed within its depths. Yet though the sea has been in all ages the highway of empire, it has been regarded by most of the generations of men as divorced from Nature as made manifest to us upon the Land. The sea has always been a dread, a wonder ; but \u2014 so far as we know \u2014 no peoples have loved it as in these latter days it is loved by us. Of old it was ever the way of adventure, of discovery, of conquest ; the girdle of safety ; an unfathomable mystery, a terror, a desolation. But it was not loved till the world had become aweary with much thought, despair, and illusive hope : till the East and South had bowed submissively to the North. And among all northern races those with Celtic blood in their veins have most loved, feared, and worshipped the sea. Along the shores of Brittany, by the caves of Guernsey and Sark, where the Cornish cliffs and rocks"], [18, "PREFATORY NOTE. XIV continually withstand the onslaught of the Atlantic, along the wild coast-line of western Ireland, and around the greater part of the Scottish sea-board \u2014 there for long years have dwelt, and dwell, those to whom the sea is the supreme mystery and wonder of creation, the most ancient thing in the world, the secret keeper of the occult knowledge of the things of oblivion. So late is the general awakening to the sea-magic that it may fairly be said to be a nineteenth-century characteristic. Before Byron and Shelley there was not much said or sung about the ocean, save incidental references such as have occurred in all literatures. In Shakespeare there is sur prisingly little, fine as are the few passages which do occur in his songs and plays. And after Shakespeare till the advent of the Romantic movement, how little there is of sea-description, of sea-love ! There is no doubt of the genuineness of Byron's love for the sea, though he was never affected by it so keenly as Shelley was. Wordsworth has endowed our literature with some splendid lines and passages, but he was at once too much of an inlander and an egoist to enter into the inherit ance of the children of the Sea. The finest sea-music in English poetry has been echoed by poets of the Victorian era, by poets now living among us. Mr Swinburne, especially, has sung of the sea with an ardour and a delight which seems unflagging ; and the word itself is to be found in his poetry with a frequency probably exceeding that of its occurrence in the collective writings of all preceding English poets. Mr Robert Buchanan, again, is noteworthy for his deep love and understanding of the"], [19, "PREFATORY NOTE. XV sea : a true northerner, he more than any other con temporary poet betrays the magic of the Celtic glamour. Mr Matthew Arnold and Lord Tennyson have written sea strains that will endure for their beauty and insight. As to the quality of insight, Mr Arnold comes nearer Heine than does any other English poet. Perhaps he too feels as strongly as did the sad, weary author of \" Die Nordsee,\" when he wrote the exquisite little lyric beginning \u2014 \"Das Meer erstrahlt im Sonnenschein- feels how good is intercommunion between transitory Man and the intransient Sea. Perhaps no writer, either in prose or verse, has sufficiently emphasised the formative power of the sea in the develop ment of human character. The sea's influence can mould a human being as its waves can mould the damp sand dunes : as the mountaineer is always a mountaineer, so the children of the sea betray unmistakably, wheresoever they may be, at once their parentage and their leaky. It is in poetry only we find that large utterance concern ing the sea, which is so infinitely beyond any prose saying : such lines, for instance, as Keats' \u2014 \" The moving waters at their priestlike task Of pure ablution round Earth's human shores.\" Or the same poet's \u2014 \" It keeps eternal whisperings around Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell Gluts twice ten thousand caverns.\" In prose we have but one writer who has been as much inspired by the magic of the sea as was Victor Hugo when"], [20, "XVI PREFATORY NOTE. he wrote \"Les Travailleurs de la Mer\" \u2014 Mr Clark Russell, in whose \"Golden Hope,\" for instance, are passages of great descriptive beauty. Among those who have written prose descriptions of certain marine aspects, and of the \"deep sea-meanings,\" Mr Ruskin is supreme. For mere delineation of marine aspects, prose is superior to poetry. I am tempted to quote two passages, one from Mr Ruskin's \" Modern Painters,\" the other from a prose poem by Mr Roden Noel : each passage in exemplification of the exquisite detail in which the prosaist can fittingly indulge, a license unpermitted to the writer in verse, \u2014 to the singer of the sea-song, the interpreter of the sea-lore, the prophet of its occult meanings and veiled prophecies. \" It is a sunset on the Atlantic after prolonged storm ; but the storm is partially lulled, and the torn and streaming rain-clouds are moving in scarlet lines to lose themselves in the hollow of the night. The whole surface of sea is divided into two ridges of enormous swell, not high, nor local, but a low, broad heaving of the whole ocean, like the lifting of its bosom by deep-drawn breath after the torture of the storm. Between these two ridges, the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea, dyeing it with an awful but glorious light, the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold and bathes like blood. Along this fiery path and valley, the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided, lift themselves in dark, indefinite, fantastic forms, each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam. They do not rise everywhere, but three or four together in wild groups, fitfully and furiously, as the under strength of the swell compels or permits them ; leaving between them treacherous space of level and whirling water, now lighted with green and lamp-like fire, now flashing back the gold of the declining sun, now fearfully dyed from above with the indistinguishable images of the burning clouds, which fall upon them in flakes of crimson and scarlet, and give"], [21, "PREFATORY NOTE. XVII to the reckless waves the added motion of their own fiery flying.\" \u2014 \" Modern Painters,\" vol. i. \" The white surges rose bodily and slowly, as with some awful deliberation, up the rock on which the lighthouse stands, and along the high rock-married structure, swallowing the whole solid mass, more than a hundred feet of granite, shrouding it from sight, the phantom armour of white water (not spray, solid water !) meeting above the lanthorn in a pointed flame, and redescending. You should climb to the very extreme point, and stand on a ledge of granite, if the direction of the wind permit the water to be carried somewhat away, \u2014 then will you behold solid moving mountains of dark bulk, of uncertain wavering ridge, following one another, their emerald crests smoking, heavily arching over in loud ruin upon where shadow grows in hollows under their altitudes impending ! What Niagaras, and Mosioatunyas, thundering upwards against sable island fortresses will you witness ! \u2014 all under low drifting storm rack, in a dun rush of blown rain, wind, and ocean confounding their tremendous sound together. But under these raging waves, they say, lies the fair land of Lyonesse, where fell King Arthur when \u2014 \" ' All day long the noise of battle rolled Among the mountains by the winter sea.' \" In one place there is a tract of pale sand left in the midst of the sea at low tide around which the water, emerald green in sunlight, paler beryl in misty weather, slowly sweeps. Through the mist one dimly discerns vast languid wreaths of spent foam, floating ' many a rood ' on the leaden wilderness.\" \u2014 \" By Cornish Seas\" (From \"Essays on Poetry and Poets\"). The Editor is indebted to Mr Theodore Watts (whose \" Ode to Mother Carey's Chicken,\" given in this volume, shows that he has a peculiar right to speak upon sea-poetry) for permission to quote the following suggestive passages from his essay upon \" Poets and the Sea \" \u2014 passages so b"], [22, "XVIII PREFATORY NOTE. particularly appropriate that they might have been written as a preface to some such compilation as \" Sea-Music \" : \u2014 \" From time immemorial the poets have taxed their energies to render in words the beauty of the earth ; and so infinite in variety is that beauty, so ever growing, and so ever changing, that the latest picture by the latest poet seems, if he have the true eye for nature, as fresh and unworn as the descriptions of Homer. But this is not so with the sea. After a few epithets the poet can say nothing to recall the beauty of her whose deepest and most abiding charm is oneness \u2014 monotony of voice, and even monotony of colour, save for such reflected hues as she can steal from the riches of heaven. The truth, of course, is that while the sea seems to be alive, but is really a mere waste of dead matter tossed about unconsciously by the winds, the earth, though without motion, contains within her warm bosom, not only a nursery for life, but very life itself. This is why it is so easy for the literary artist to paint the earth, so difficult for him to paint the sea. With very few exceptions the poets do not attempt to do it, but instead depict the sensations and emotions to which the sea gives birth in its impact on the body and the soul of man. \" Perhaps to enjoy to the full all the delights the sea has in store for us there is needed something more than the capacity for being exhilarated by the buffets of the wind and the tossing of billows. It may even be said, perhaps, that he who would enjoy the fierce delights of a storm at sea more than most others is precisely he who might not have the fullest anDreciation of the sea's permanent message"], [23, "PREFATORY NOTE. XIX \u2014 the message of resignation to the awards of Fate, recog nition of the wild and wonderful romance of the human poem, and sweet acceptance of Death, the soother of sorrows \u2014 precisely he who might feel most sorely that ' monotony ' which the larger portion of good sailors are apt to complain of, though in this very monotony lies the sea's greatest fascination for certain temperaments. There is many a man who can get a rapture of enjoyment from a short trip in a yacht, or even from a rapid steam-run across the Atlantic, who would find a long voyage with a hand ful of prosaic companions positively insupportable. \" In these days it cannot be too frequently iterated and reiterated that to the sea England and the English-speaking race owe everything. Whatever may be said of England's decadence as a physical force among the other great physi cal forces of Europe, her unique destiny as the great moral force of the world is becoming more and more obvious every day. The peculiar racial characteristics of her people, her language, her literature, her traditions, are colouring the great tide of human life, as the mighty river beyond the peaks of Kaf coloured, according to the Mohammedan fancy, the waters of the ocean ' as with the living blood of all gems.' \" And what is the cause of this ? The feverish attention lately given to colonial matters on the Continent, and the talk of Imperial Federation in England, show what is the general opinion as to the cause. A great racial struggle for life is imminent in Europe, outlets for the teeming popula tions of the old world are urgently demanded, and practi cally there are no new countries left to develop. In the"], [24, "PREFATORY NOTE. XX new world of the North-West and in the new world scat tered over the boundless bosom of the great Southern Ocean, the whole of the lands in the temperate zones have been appropriated, and by whom ? Mainly by the English. That this is the cause of England's present dominance and of her stupendous future has now become an axiom on the Continent. \" But what is the cause of the cause ? How has it come about that in the unfilled lands of the temperate zone \u2014 in North America, in Africa, in Australia \u2014 almost every square mile of land is in the hands of Englishmen ? Among Englishmen we, of course, include our brothers of the United States, with whom we of this island share with pride our blood and traditions, and between whom and us the bonds of affectionate sympathy are becoming closer and closer every year and every day. Is it true, as English chauvinists assume it to be, that in the great racial struggle for life the Englishman is specially organised for success ? Does the English race really exhibit any superiority over the other European races ? Are Englishmen and Americans more courageous than Germans, or more energetic ? Are they more high-spirited than the French, or more deft, or more frugal ? Are they more nobly endowed than the Italians with that dignified common- sense which is said to be the very salt of life ? To answer these questions in the affirma tive would, no doubt, be pleasant, but would it be justified by the facts? Would any English employer of labour, skilled or unskilled, answer them in the affirmative ? No : there is another cause \u2014 a cause wholly unrelated to race \u2014 for the prospects of the English race. That cause is the sea."], [25, "PREFATORY NOTE. XXI \"From no peculiar merit of its own, but from the favouritism of circumstance is the English race destined to hold the world in its hand. The Englishman's birthplace having been the only large and fruitful island of the Old World, he has become the child of the sea. That the high road of the ocean should lead him all over the world was simply inevitable. Hence England's destiny as ' the august mother of empires ' should give rise to no vainglory in any Englishman's breast ; but rather it should give rise to a feeling of modesty, almost of humiliation, before responsi bilities so vast. It should cause us to ask ourselves, Are we really and fully worthy of this favouritism of the sea? Thanks to the 'silver streak,' which is worth an entire European army, the English race, instead of exhausting its force, as the other less lucky races have been obliged to do, in defending frontiers, has been enabled to give all its energies to strengthening its limbs at home, and finding fresh fields in which to exercise them abroad. \" It is, however, only of late years that the fact has been ignored that England owes her very existence to the sea \u2014 that without the sea she is nothing. The finest marine lyric in this or any other language \u2014 ' Ye Mariners of England ' \u2014 was written, as the greatest contemporary nautical writer has pointed out, by a man who had no knowledge whatever of the sailor's calling. And there is no need whatever, as Mr Clark Russell goes on to say, why the ' So ho's,' ' Heave ho's,' and ' Pull away, boys,' of the Dibdin school of marine poets should be revived. So the landsman, if he have the true sea-feeling, need not shrink from entering the field. Thus considered, a writer of good sea-poetry would confer a"], [26, "PREFATORY NOTE. XXII service on the country should he revive in the breasts of Englishmen the old passion for the traditions of the English navy.\" It is curfous to note that even as the finest marine lyric in our language was written by one who was no seaman, so perhaps the most striking marine sonnet in our language is the production of a writer who was certainly not in the general sense a poet of nature, whose observation of nature, indeed, was almost solely the outcome of the pictorial instinct. Rossetti undoubtedly saw not only truly but acutely ; but it was the artist noting \" effects,\" not the poet perceiving subtle beauties. The sonnet in question was written on the occasion of the meeting at an anniversary banquet of the three remaining veterans who as lads had served under Nelson at his greatest sea-fight, and was appropriately entitled by Rossetti \"The Last Three from Trafalgar.\" \"The Last Three from Trafalgar, \" In grappled ships around the ' Victory,' Three boys did England's Duty with stout cheer, While one dread truth was kept from every ear, More dire than deafening fire that churned the sea : For in the flag-ship's weltering cockpit, he Who was the Battle's Heart without a peer, He who had seen all fearful sights save Fear, Was passing from all life save Victory. \"And round the old memorial board to-day, Three greybeards \u2014 each a war-worn British Tar \u2014 View through the mist of years that hour afar : Who soon shall greet, 'mid memories of fierce fray, The impassioned soul which on its radiant way Soared through the fiery cloud of Trafalgar.\""], [27, "PREFATORY NOTE.

Seaward the waters run their scurrying race ; Billows curl upward oftener with white face ; And that long streak where broken waves leap high The limit of the ocean, nears apace. The salt spray born of clashing wave and wave, Anon a land-wind to the westward drave, And tangled beds of sea-weed drifted by, And strong-winged sea-gulls through the spray-showers clave. The last faint gleam dies off the steadfast vane ; The risen vapour thickens into rain ; The sky stoops downward to the leaden sea, Veiling the land. Will he see land again ? Drifting away upon the ebbing tide, Oarless toward an ocean, opening wide Beyond the bar, o'er which even now in glee Waves toss him. Only God can be his guide."], [494, "464 SEA-MUSIC.

The world below the brine, Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves, Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle, openings, and pink turf, Different colours, pale grey and green, purple, white, and gold, the play of light through the water, Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes, and the aliment of the swimmers, Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling close to the bottom, The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting with his flukes, The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea- leopard, and the sting-ray, Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean- depths, breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do, The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere, The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.

After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds, After the white-grey sails taut to their spars and ropes, Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, listing up their necks, Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship, Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves, Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves, Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface, Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing, The wake of the sea-ship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome under the sun, A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments, Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following.

Shine I shine I shine! Pour down your tvarmth, great sun ! While we bask, we two together. Two together! Winds blow south, or winds blow north, Day come white, or night come black, Home, or rivers and mountains from home, Singing all time, minding no time, While we two keep together. Till of a sudden, Maybe kill'd, unknown to her mate, One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on her nect, Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,"], [498, "468 SEA-MUSIC. Nor ever appear'd again. And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea, And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather, Over the hoarse surging of the sea, Or flitting from brier to brier by day, I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird, The solitary guest from Alabama. Blow ! blow ! blow ! Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore; I wait and I wait till you blow my maie to me. Yes, when the stars glisten'd, All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake, Down almost amid the slapping waves, Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears. He call'd on his mate, He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know. Yes, my brother, I know, The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note, For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding, Silent, avoiding the moonbeam, blending myself with the shadows, Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts, The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing, I with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair, Listen'd long and long. Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes, Following you, my brother."], [499, "WALT WHITMAN. 469 Soothe ! soothe ! soothe ! Close on its wave soothes the waves behind.
