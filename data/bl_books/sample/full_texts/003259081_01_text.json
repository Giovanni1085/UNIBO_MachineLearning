The following fcenes are the produce of that refolution. The manufcript of the Author was fome time fince put into the hands of the Editor; who, on perufing it, difcovered a great many beau ties, furraunded by almoft as many defects. The Tragedy was not finifhed; and, from the difpofition of the Xcenes, and conduct of the cataflrophe, it appeared altogether unfit for the itage. In this rude ftate the Editor prefented it to the Manager of Covent-Garden Theatre, who re ceived it with candour, and at a convenient oppor tunity read the Play with him, and agreed to bring it on the ftage, when the neceffary alterations, to fit it for the fcene, fhould be made.
