The materials for the following history were princi pally gathered from old settlers during a recent residence of some length in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina. Several of these were descendants of charac ters who appear in the narrative, and one of them was the son of a trusted friend of Sevier, and the secretary of his abortive commonwealth of Franklin. This gen tleman was Dr. J. G. M. Eamsey, of Knoxville, the ven erable author of the \"Annals of Tennessee.\" He had known Sevier and Kobertson intimately in his youth \u2014 they not having died till he was nearly of the age of manhood \u2014 and during nearly fifty years he had been president of the Tennessee Historical Society, and a dili gent student of Western history. Though when I knew him Dr. Eamsey was bed-rid den and approaching his ninetieth year, his mind was as clear and his memory as distinct as in his prime, and he delighted in nothing so much as recounting those olden days when civilization was first planted beyond the Alleghanies. He was a lovable old man, fond of social converse ; and, knowing this, I often visited him, and at"], [14, "PREFACE. IV times listened for hours, while, with glowing face and gleaming eye, he poured forth a stream of quaint elo quence that was absolutely musical. Both he and his subject fascinated me ; and, seeing this, he at length pro posed that I should write out a full and connected his tory of the early settlers beyond the mountains \u2014 a work he had intended to do, but had been prevented from doing by occupations during the war and his subsequent infirmities. Without actually deciding to do this, I set about a systematic investigation of the subject, seeking acquaintance with many of the old settlers, visiting the scenes where important events had occurred, and read ing what little had been written about that early period. Then I investigated collateral events, and attempted to place these pioneers in their appropriate positions on the broad canvas of American history. In this I had not proceeded far when I discovered a fact which surprised me with its novelty. That fact was this : That three of these unknown backwoodsmen, clad in buckskin hunting - shirts, and leading inconsiderable forces to battle in the depths of a far-away forest, not only planted civilization beyond the Alleghanies, but exerted a most important influence in shaping the destinies of this country. To the reader this statement may appear wildly extravagant; and so the idea seemed to me until I had thoroughly studied the sub ject, and taken a view of all the circumstances. Then I saw clearly two things : first, that two of these men had thrice saved the country by thwarting the British plan to"], [15, "PREFACE. V envelop and crush the Southern Colonies, and by turning the tide of the Eevolution at King's Mountain ; and, second, that, after the Eevolution, the three acting to gether had frustrated the design of Spain to dismember and weaken the Union by causing the erection of a sep arate republic in the country between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi, which erection would have kept the vast region beyond that river a Spanish province, and closed it forever to the entrance of Anglo-Saxon civiliza tion. These three men were John Sevier, Isaac Shelby, and James Eobertson, all of them characters worthy of the most heroic ages, and so exactly adapted to the work which had to be done that the conclusion is irresistible that they were, like Washington and Lincoln, \"provi dential men.\" They marched to the sound of neither drum nor bugle, and no flaming bulletins proclaimed their exploits in the ears of a listening continent ; their slender forces trod silently the Western solitudes, and their greatest battles were insignificant skirmishes never reported beyond the mountains ; but their deeds were pregnant with consequences that will be felt along the coming centuries. It is for this reason that their history should be written. In this volume I have attempted to depict the work of these men from the first settlement of Watauga to the close of the Eevolutionary War ; and, in writing it, I have availed myself of Dr. Eamsey's \"Annals,\" and gleaned some facts in reference to the King's Mountain"], [16, "PREFACE. VI expedition from the work of Lyman C. Draper, LL. D. ; but a large part of my material I have derived from what may be termed \"original sources\" \u2014 old settlers, whose statements I have carefully verified and compared with one another. In a second volume I shall hope to bring events down to the deaths of Sevier and Eobertson. I will merely add, in the words of the writer of the book of Maccabees, \"Let this be enough in the way of a preface, for it is a foolish thing to make a long pro logue and to be short in the story itself. I have taken in hand no easy task, yea, rather a business full of watch ing and labor. ...

It is related of Daniel Boone that when he climbed to the summit of the Alleghanies, and looked down upon the vast herds of deer and buffalo which were grazing at his feet, he said to his companion, Calla way, \"I am richer than the man in Scripture who owned the cattle on a thousand hills : I own the wild beasts in a thousand valleys.\" It may be questioned if Boone had any adequate conception of the stupendous possessions of the \"man in Scripture \" ; but he was certainly justified in boast ing of the wide magnificence of this domain, which, by \"right of discovery,\" he claimed as his own. One of its native inhabitants might have told him that two stout braves, with two paddles, could not skirt its southern and western boundaries, and reach its northern limit on the Ohio, in less than \"three moons \" ; but no language known to the Indian could describe the boundless wealth, animate and inanimate,"], [30, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 10 that lay hidden in its unexplored recesses. By the leaves on the trees, or the stars of a cloudless night, he might have indicated the countless wild animals that roamed over it ; but how would he have pictured the leafy magnificence of its forests, or the grassy luxuriance of the many \"openings\" that everywhere dotted its surface \u2014 the burial-places of a long-vanished race, which has faded from the earth, leaving only these silent memorials of its existence ? And yet this magnificent domain Charles II had given away, in a fit of lavish munificence, to a few of his favorites, at a time when he neglected to pay his honest debts, and was content to supply himself with pocket-money by the betrayal of his country. But what better could be expected of a man so lamentably ignorant of geography as to describe this kingly tract as bounded by two white stakes on the shore of the Atlantic \u2014 one at the twenty-ninth parallel, the other at 36\u00b0, 30' \u2014 and extending thence westward to the \" South Seas \" ! \u2014 a description more indefinite than that of the famous Fourth of July orator, who, about the time of the Mexi can War, bounded this country \"on the north by the Aurora Borealis, on the east by the rising sun, on the west by the horizon, and on the south by as far as you have a mind to go.\" Explorers have traversed every square mile of this territory for now more than two cent uries, and yet that western boundary of Charles II is still undiscovered.

Here was born, and cradled, and fostered into lusty life, the infant Hercules who was to found in those Western wilds a grander empire than the world has seen since the age of Pericles. This volume \u2014 with one to follow it \u2014 is an imperfect attempt to do tardy justice to the men who not only reared this young giant, but in the darkest hour of our Revolutionary War threw their swords into the trem bling scale, and turned the balance for American free dom. They were the rear-guard of the Revolution, as well as the advance-guard of Civilization ; and yet they are scarcely mentioned in general history : for their work was done in the silence of the wilderness, and if for a moment they emerged into the view of men to strike a vital blow for their country, they vanished again, as quickly as they came, into the solitudes of the far-off forest. But they were patriots and heroes, and their names should not be suffered to perish. All of them were men of Spartan mould, and one was of a nature so many-sided, and so great, as to be altogether the most unique charac ter in American history. Boone was merely a pioneer, a scout in advance of civilization, and by his very nature he was bound to keep always a length ahead of the bat talion of emigration ; but, thanks to Byron and the biog-"], [32, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 12 raphers, he is to-day known half the world over. But John Sevier was more than a pioneer, more even than a statesman, or a general : he was a civilizer, a great or ganizer, a nation-builder, and one of those absolutely unselfish spirits whom God scatters only here and there through the centuries. And yet his history is still un written, and he is to-day almost unknown east of the Alleghanies. But it is not so beyond the mountains. There he is spoken of with a love and veneration that are seldom accorded by one man to another. I know of no other man who ever held, as he did for forty-five years', the unbroken confidence and undivided affection of a whole people. Even now, when for three fourths of a century he has been in his grave, old men speak his name with loving reverence, and young children listen with wondering delight to the thrilling story of his life, in many a stately home and many a rude cabin west of the Alleghanies. The lives of such men are the common property of the country ; and in a time like this, when the greed of gold is festering at the very heart of the nation, it is well such a life should be told, that we may contemplate a character who had no ambition but duty, and no greed but the good of his fellows. In writing it, I shall have to relate the lives of his compatriots, and recount the story of the early settlements beyond the Alleghanies ; for his career was so interwoven with the history of the community that one can not be told without relating the other. For more than forty years he was the moving"], [33, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 13 spring of every event, the soul of a whole common wealth ; and this it is which makes his career, as well as his character, so unique in our history. The theatre of his operations is a territory larger than the combined kingdoms of England and Scotland ; and from the great richness of its soil it is capable of sus taining a much denser population than now inhabits the British Islands. Two noble rivers sweep in concentric circles through its most fertile portion, and the great Father of Waters drains its western boundary, affording ready transportation to the seaboard. It yields abun dantly all the products known to the temperate regions, and has a mild and equable climate \u2014 not so hot as to re lax, nor so cold as to benumb, the physical energies ; and hence it possesses all the elements essential to the growth of a country in wealth, intelligence, and civilization. And yet throughout this vast region there could not, until the year 1769, be found a single human habitation, not a solitary hut of the white settler, nor a smoky wigwam of a roving Cherokee. It was the hunting ground and battle-field of the Indians, claimed by hos tile tribes, but occupied by none, and hence was an in viting field for civilized settlement. King Charles modestly called the vast country he bestowed upon his favorites \"Carolina,\" in honor of himself, and he claimed title to it by what is called the \" right of discovery,\" which implies that some of his sub jects had sailed along its western limits, or hunted deer, or trapped for beaver, somewhere within its borders."], [34, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 14 Boone's jocose claim was intended to be absurd, and yet it rested upon the same basis as that of the English king, and had the additional strength of actual occupation, evidence of which he has handed down to us in his sign manual, affixed to the trunk of a large beech, which still stands on the bank of Boone's Creek\u2014 a branch of the Watauga\u2014 not far from Jonesboro, in Tennessee.

So it was left to King George to enforce the discovery title, and this he did, utterly ignoring the fact that certain Shawnees, Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws had pad dled up and down the Mississippi, aud hunted deer and trapped for beaver upon this territory for an indefinite"], [35, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 15 number of centuries before William the Illegitimate founded the commonwealth of England. The Indian has naturally a keen and shrewd intellect, but he never could understand this logic of the white man, namely, that the mere looking at or handling of a thing gives one its ownership. The Cherokees \u2014 perhaps the most intelligent of all the North American tribes \u2014 seemed the most obtuse when the colonial governors of George H attempted to instruct them in this branch of civilized knowledge. Then it occurred to the sapient king that, as his servants had failed to properly instruct the savages, he had himself better attend personally to their education. Accordingly, he invited half a dozen of the Cherokee chieftains to visit him at his great house on the other side of the Atlantic. They went, ne shook hands with them, showed them his ships of war, his troops and arsenals, and the great crowds of people who came and went through the streets of London, and, more than this, invited them to drink Holland gin with him at his own table in the palace of St. James ; but he never said one word to them about the \" right of discov ery,\" nor gave them a single lesson in civilized logic. One of these chieftains was Oconostota, then a young man, but already of great influence among his people. He was a magnificent specimen of physical manhood, and, withal, had that keenness of perception, grasp of intellect, and strength of will which are accounted great ness. These qualities made him afterward the archima gus and most eminent man among the Cherokees."], [36, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 16 Queen Caroline, who was much more of a man than her husband, had a fine perception of character. She saw the budding greatness of the splendid young savage, and paid him very distinguished attention. She introduced him to the ladies of her court, drove him about her pal ace-grounds, and lavished upon him all those blandish ments which she knew so well how to use when she de sired to cajole a friend or conciliate an enemy. It is impossible to say whether it was owing to the affability of the queen, or the Hollands of the king, or to what he saw of the prowess of the British people, but it is certain that from this time forth Oconostota quietly acquiesced in the doctrine of discovery, and for more than fifty years \u2014 with only one brief and bloody inter ruption \u2014 remained the fast friend and loyal subject of the British crown. This fact entailed upon the white settlers beyond the Alleghanies twenty-five years of sav age warfare, and upon all who would understand their history the necessity to know something about Oconos tota and the Cherokees. The Cherokee name for \"fire\" is \"cheera,\" which element they believe to compose the lower heaven ; hence, their magi are styled cheera-taghe (men of di vine fire), and their braves cheera-kee (sons of fire), a word which, in the time of the Revolution, well ex pressed the burning valor of their warriors. Among themselves the nation was called Tsaraghee, but by the whites the name, applied properly to only the braves, came gradually to designate the whole people."], [37, "ENGLAND'S .ALLIES. 17 When first known to Europeans, and until their re moval by General Scott beyond the Mississippi, they occupied a country forming now the upper portion of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and all that part of Tennessee which lies south of the Little Tennessee River ; but their tradition is that their original home was in the very far West, and this is confirmed by the fact that in their language are words to represent the whale and other marine animals, which indicates that at some dis tant period they lived on or near the shore of an ocean. They were the mountaineers of aboriginal America, and, like most mountaineers, had an intense love of country, and a keen appreciation of the beautiful in Nature, as is shown by the poetical names they have bequeathed to their rivers and mountains. They were a manly race, uniformly tall and athletic, and of superior courage and intelligence. It was their military prowess alone that enabled them to retain possession of their country \u2014 one of the most beautiful in the world \u2014 against the repeated attacks of the many war-like tribes by whom they were surrounded. Like all savage people, the Cherokees were intensely superstitious. They believed in one Great Spirit, who governs all things, but has deputed the administration of human affairs to two inferior divinities \u2014 one good, the other evil. The evil spirit had great control over man kind, and would stand, at a last day, as the accuser of all nations. He was well-nigh ubiquitous, being every where when least wanted or expected ; but he had his"], [38, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 18 throne among the peaks and precipices of Whiteside Mountain, one of the loftiest of the Cowee range, and near its southern terminus. There, in a moss-grown inclosure, curved by Nature to form the segment of a circle, and walled in by stupendous rocks which rise to a perpendicular height of eighteen hundred feet, he held his court ; but, casting aside his state, he occa sionally walked abroad upon the earth, and then, as he strode in the darkness from peak to peak, leaving upon the bald mountain-tops the print of his awful footsteps, he spoke to the red man in the storm and the thunder. They believed their people were originally mortal, in spirit as well as in body; but that above the clouds, where the highest mountains lift their tallest peaks, was a celestial forest inhabited by immortals. Ages ago the great chief of this forest had wooed a Cherokee maiden, and to win her as his bride had consented that thence forth all brave warriors and their faithful squaws should be admitted to the celestial hunting-grounds. Thus he became the guardian spirit of the Cherokees \u2014 to watch over them in life, and to rescue them in death from their evil genius. Uncommon events they attributed to supernatural agency, either to evil spirits, or to the guardian angel who presided over their destinies. Witches and sorcer ers were the agents of the evil spirits ; but their power could be overcome by their good spirit, who would act through the intercession of the medicine or beloved man"], [39, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 19 of the tribe, who was his immediate and recognized agent. This person was always one of superior intelli gence, and, like the famous prophet of the Shawnees, officiated as physician, priest, and intercessor with the invisible powers. On occasions the beloved man exer cised a stronger influence over the tribe than even the archimagus, or the most redoubtable chieftains. Dur ing and after the Revolution this office was held by a woman ; and, as will appear in the course of this history, her single will often thwarted the deliberate and deeply concerted plans of the great council of the nation, at the head of which was Oconostota, the ablest and most pow erful king ever known among the Cherokees. The Cherokee, having thus two divinities, prayed, like the cautious deacon, \"Good Lord\" and \"Good Devil,\" and he sought to propitiate them both by numberless ceremonies. Many of these were interesting and signifi cant ; but space forbids my giving them an extended de scription. The government of the Cherokees was an elective monarchy \u2014 absolute in time of war, not so absolute in time of peace, when every man did pretty much accord ing to his own will, governed only by the savage law of lex talionis : an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a pel try for a peltry. The king was always their konning, or strong man ; and, though elective and subject to depo sition without notice, he often held power, as did Ocon ostota, for half a century. Under him was the half or vice king, who was second in command, and acted in"], [40, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 20 his stead in case of the sudden death of the monarch. These two rulers, with the chieftains, or princes of the scattered villages, composed the supreme council of the nation, which sat at Echota, their capital, and decided all important questions in peace and war. But over the archimagus, or king, and even the supreme council, was the great and good spirit who was the guardian of the Cherokees, and who uttered his will through the beloved man or woman of the tribe. The whole was a rude copy of the Jewish monarchy \u2014 an earthly king, and an in spired prophet who spoke the commands of an invisible Jehovah. A copy and yet an original ! Their civil code was very brief : Give to every man his own, but exact your own to the uttermost farthing. Retaliation with them was a religious duty ; and no obli gation was so sacred as that of sacrificing a murderer to the spirit of his victim. Speaking of their passion for revenge, Adair, who lived among them forty years, says : \" I have known them to go a thousand miles, in pathless woods, over hills and mountains, through large cane swamps full of grape-vines and briers, over broad lakes, rapid rivers, and deep creeks ; and all the way endan gered by poisonous snakes, if not with the rambling and lurking enemy ; while, at the same time, they were ex posed to the extremities of heat and cold, the vicissitudes of the seasons, to hunger and thirst, to fatigue and other difficulties. Such is their overboiling revengeful tem per, that they utterly contemn all these things as imag inary trifles, if they are so happy as to get the scalp of"], [41, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 21 the murderer or enemy, to satisfy the supposed craving ghosts of their deceased relatives.\" If I add that they were proud, skillful in war, insen sible to danger, and possessed of a thirst for blood, which when once aroused made them rush into slaughter like horses into a burning barn, it will be seen that they were not contemptible antagonists for even that race of heroes who were the first settlers beyond the Alleghanies. The Cherokees had no large cities, nor even villages, but dwelt in scattered townships in the vicinity of some stream where fish and game could be found in abun dance. A number of their towns, bearing the musical names of Tallasse, Tamottee, Chilhowee, Citico, Ten nassee, and Echota, were, at the opening of the Revolu tionary War, located upon the rich lowlands lying be tween the Tellico and Little Tennessee Rivers. About one third of the tribe occupied these settlements, and they were known as the Ottari, or, among the mountains, Cherokees. About the same number were located near the head-waters of the Savannah, in the great highland belt between the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains, and they were styled Erati, or, in the valley, Cherokees. Another body, among whom were many Creeks, and which was somewhat more numerous and much more lawless than either of the others, occupied towns along the Tennessee, in the vicinity of Lookout Mountain. These, from their residence near the creek of that name, were known as Chickamaugas. These three bodies were one people, governed by one"], [42, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 22 archimagus, and at this time they numbered in all about thirty thousand people, between three and four thou sand of whom were \"gun men,\" or warriors. Echota, which was located on the northern bank of the Tellico, about five miles from the site of Fort Lou don, and thirty southwest from the present city of Knoxville, contained their great council-house, and was the home of the archimagus, and the beloved woman, or prophetess of the tribe. It was their sacred town, or \" city of refuge \" ; for this singular people had this addi tional likeness to the Jews under the old theocracy. Once within the limits of Echota, an open foe, or even a red-handed criminal, could dwell in peace and security. The only danger was in going and returning. It is re lated that an Englishman, who in self-defense had slain a Cherokee, once fled to this sacred city to escape the vengeance of the kindred of his victim. He was treated here with so much kindness that after a time he deemed it prudent to leave his asylum. The Indians warned him against the danger ; but he ventured forth, and on the following morning his body was found on the out skirts of the town, pierced through and through with a score of arrows. A brief description of this town will afford an idea of all the Cherokee settlements. It consisted of a hundred or more cabins and wigwams, scattered with some regularity, but at wide intervals, along the bank of the river. The cabins, like those of the white set tlers, were square, and built of logs ; but the wigwams"], [43, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 23 were conical, and framed upon slender poles, gathered together at the top, and covered with buffalo robes, dressed and smoked to render them impervious to the weather. An opening in the side formed the entrance, and over it was hung a buffalo hide to serve as a door. The fire was built in the center of the lodge, and di rectly over it was an aperture to let out the smoke. Here the women performed culinary operations, except in summer, when such employments were carried on in the open air. At night the occupants of the lodge spread their skins and buffalo robes on the ground, and men, women, and children went to sleep upon them, spread out like a fan, with their feet to the fire. By day the robes were rolled together into mats, and made to serve as seats. An ordinary lodge would com fortably house a dozen persons, but two families never occupied one domicile ; and, as the Cherokees seldom had a numerous progeny, it was not often that more than five or six individuals were tenants of one wig wam. In Echota these rude dwellings were mostly on the two sides of a broad avenue, shaded here and there with great oaks and poplars, and trodden hard with the feet of many men and horses. In the rear of each lodge was a small patch of cleared land, where the women and negro slaves \u2014 stolen from the white set tlers over the mountains \u2014 cultivated beans, corn, and potatoes, and occasionally some such fruits as pears, plums, and apples. All labor was done by the women"], [44, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 24 and slaves, it being beneath the dignity of a Cherokee brave to follow any occupation except that of killing \u2014 either wild animals in the hunt, or his enemies in war. The house-lots were without fences, and not an inclos ure was to be seen in the whole settlement \u2014 cattle and horses being left to roam at large in the woods and \"openings,\" where was the finest of pasturage. A little apart from the other wigwams in Echota stood one more pretentious than the rest. Like the others, it had a frame of poles, covered with tanned skins, but it was of larger size, and distinguished from them by a singular \"totem\" \u2014 an otter in the coils of a water-snake. It was the home, and this the coat of arms, of \"Nancy Ward,\" the prophetess of the Chero kees. Near it was the domicile of Oconostota, the re nowned archimagus, and not far away was the grand council-house of the tribe. This last building occupied a spacious opening, and was a circular, tower-shaped structure, some twenty feet high and ninety in circumference. It was rudely built of stout poles, plastered with clay, and had a roof of the same material, which sloped down to broad eaves that gave effectual protection to the walls from the rain. Its wide entrance was covered with a couple of buffalo skins, hung so as to meet together in the middle ; but it was without windows, an aperture in the roof, protected by a flap, serving to let the smoke out, and the light in \u2014 just enough to make more sensi ble the gloom that shrouded the interior. Low benches,"], [45, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 25 neatly made of cane, were ranged around the circum ference of the room ; and on these sat the warriors of the tribe when they gathered to the great councils ; but they were cleared away when the braves met here to perform their green-corn dance \u2014 a ceremonial resem bling the offering of the first-fruits among the Jews. And now, with such a brief glance at the annals of the tribe as is necessary to an understanding of the part they took in our Revolutionary history, I will take leave of the Cherokees until such times as we have to en counter them again in connection with the early white settlers. They were visited by De Soto as early as 1540 ; but their interior position kept them long from any intercourse with the white settlers on the sea-coast of Carolina. The first white man who is known to have resided among them was one Cornelius Dogherty, an enterprising but lax-principled Irishman, who estab lished himself as a trader in one of the Cherokee towns in 1690. He introduced horses among them from the whites ; and soon they became expert horse-thieves. In retali ation, the white settlers encouraged the tribes living nearer the Atlantic to steal the Cherokees themselves, and incited tribal wars, in which hundreds of the Cherokee braves were captured, sold to the colonists, and by them shipped to Cuba, or consigned to hard labor in the malarial swamps along the sea-coast. Be ing of great strength and endurance, they were more valued as slaves than the more patient and docile ne- 2"], [46, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 26 gro. In 1693, after many of their principal braves had been sold into slavery, twenty of the head men of the tribe visited the governor of Carolina, at Charleston, and besought his protection against their neighbors, the Esaws, Congarees, and Tuscaroras. This was granted on condition that the Cherokees should admit the \" right of discovery \" by acknowledging the sovereignty of Great Britain. The Indians had no alternative, so the slave-trade was stopped ; and then commenced the long subjection of the Cherokees to Great Britain, which led them to side with the mother country dur ing the war of the Revolution. In 1730 began the great conflict between the French and English for the possession of North America. Actual blood was not shed till 1752, but during this year was developed the great project of the French, of uniting Canada and Louisiana, and thus bringing the whole territory between the Gulf and the St. Lawrence under their dominion. Already they had seduced the Northern tribes ; and now their emissaries were busy among the Southern Indians. The various tribes won over, the English settlements would be rolled back to the sea-board, then subdued, or driven into the ocean. It was a gigantic scheme, and, had it succeeded, would have changed the face of the world. But it did not succeed, for Providence had destined the Anglo- Saxon race to be the subduers and civilizers of North America. To counteract this gigantic scheme, Sir Alexander"], [47, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 27 Cuming was sent in 1730 on a mission to the Creeks and Cherokees. The latter tribe then occupied the country around the head-waters of the Savannah, and stretching northward beyond the Appalachian Mountains ; but Cuming met their head men at Requasse, a town among the mountains of North Carolina, and near the sources of the Hiwasee. They were at this time computed to number forty thousand people and six thousand warriors, and a vast assemblage came together to meet the British envoy. Cuming demanded a renewal of their submission to King George, and the right to build forts and quarter soldiers among them. They assented to this, and the head men, falling on their knees, swore eternal allegiance to the British crown. Cuming then nominated Moytoy, a chieftain of Tellico, as their head king, and, by unani mous consent, he was inaugurated as archimagus and commander of the whole nation. A crown was placed upon his head, and he was invested with all the gewgaws of royalty. When this was done, the new-made king removed his crown, and, handing it to Cuming, with five eagle tails and some scalps of their enemies, requested that he should lay them at the feet of the great father on the other side of the ocean. This Cuming declined to do, but suggested instead that Moytoy should send a deputation of his bravest chiefs to meet in person the king of England. Six of them accordingly went, among whom was Oconostota, as I have related. They were admitted to the presence of George II, and promised"], [48, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 28 him, in the name of their nation, to continue forever his majesty's loyal friends and subjects. A few years later (in 1738) the small-pox, which, along with guns, gunpowder, and bad whisky, the whites had introduced among the Indians, swept over the Cherokee country, depopulating whole towns, and reduc ing the people to about one half their former numbers. When the plague ceased, the nation could muster scarcely two thousand warriors. Soon afterward Ocon ostota was made archimagus, or chief king, and an able chieftain named Atta-Culla-Culla was elected half-king. They held these positions when actual hostilities broke out between the French and English in 1752, and till after the colonies had achieved their independence of Great Britain. True to the allegiance sworn to by his predecessor, Oconostota, on the breaking out of the French War, sent messengers to Governor Glen, of South Carolina, appris ing him that some Frenchmen and their Indian allies were among his people, endeavoring to seduce them from their friendship to the English, and recommending that a general council be held with the nation to renew their former treaties. The governor saw the force of this sug gestion, and, accordingly, in 1755 he met the Cherokee chiefs and warriors in their own country. About five hundred braves were present. A platform was erected for the governor under a spreading tree, and Atta-Culla- Culla, who, on account of his eloquence, had been ap pointed speaker for the occasion, took a seat on it beside"], [49, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 29 him. The other warriors stood around in silent gravity, giving close attention to the proceedings. The governor was the first to speak. Rising from his seat, he represented in strong terms the power, opu lence, and great goodness of George II, and his special affection for his Cherokee children. He had, he said, many gifts to make them, but he demanded in return the donation of a share of their territory and land upon which to build forts to protect his soldiers against their enemies, and be a refuge to their friends and allies, the Indians. Then he pictured to them the poverty and denounced the wicked designs of the French king, ex pressing the hope that the Cherokees would allow no Frenchman to enter their towns and poison the minds of their young men against the great and good King George. This is the substance of the governor's harangue. The simple savages listened to it with grave approval, and turned with silent expectation to their own speaker, the really great and good Atta-Culla-Culla. Holding a bow in one hand and a shaft of arrows in the other, he now rose and addressed the governor as follows : \"What I now speak our father, the great king, should hear. We are brothers to the people of Carolina ; one house covers us all.\" Taking then a little boy by the hand, and presenting him to the governor, he said : \"We, our wives, and our children, are all children of the great King George. I have brought this child that, when he grows up, he may remember our agreement on"], [50, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 30 this day, and tell it to the next generation, that it may be known forever.\" Then, opening a bag of earth, and placing it at the governor's feet, he continued : \" We freely surrender a part of our lands to the great king. The French want our possessions, but we will defend them while one of our nation shall remain alive. These are all the arms\" \u2014 showing his bow and arrows \u2014 \"we can make for our defense. We hope the king will pity his children, the Cherokees, and send us guns and am munition. We fear not the French. Give us arms, and we will go to war against the enemies of the great king.\" Then, handing the governor a string of wampum to con firm what he had said, he added : \" My speech is at an end ; it is the voice of the Cherokee nation. I hope the governor will send it to the king, that it may be kept forever.\" By a treaty that followed the Cherokees ceded a large territory to the English, of which formal deeds of con veyance were now executed by the head men in the name of the whole people. Soon afterward two forts were erected by the English within the Cherokee territory \u2014 one in the vicinity of Keowee, an Indian town near the head-waters of the Savannah ; the other not far from their capital city, Echota, on the southern bank of the Little Tennessee. This last, which was called Fort Lou don, was in the very heart of the Cherokee nation, and a hundred and fifty miles west of the most westerly white settlement then in existence. It was soon garri soned by two hundred regular soldiers, and, owing to an"], [51, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 31 influx of hunters and traders, became speedily the center of a thriving village. Hostilities were now in active progress between the French and English, and large numbers of the loyal Cherokees joined the British army. Several hundred were in the northern campaign which resulted in the capture of Fort Du Quesne. Having lost their horses on the expedition, and being poorly supplied with ra tions, they helped themselves, on their return through Western Virginia, to such provisions as came in their way, and appropriated a few horses which they found running at large in the woods. Forgetting that these Cherokees had saved their homes from burning, and their wives and children from intended massacre, the German settlers of that region fell upon them, and in a night attack, killed and scalped some fourteen, and took a larger number prisoners. In the butchery they even imitated the cruelty of the worst savages ; and Adair adds, \" The murderers were so audacious as to impose the scalps on the government for those of French Indians, and actually obtained the premium allowed at that time by law.\" As was natural, thi3 atrocity aroused at once a spirit of deep resentment and bloody retaliation among the Cherokees ; and the chieftains were powerless to prevent an outbreak by the whole nation. Oconostota at first, much against his will, consented that only as many whites should be slaughtered as would equal the killed of his own people ; but the work of blood once begun,"], [52, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 32 either he could not restrain his braves, or his own savage nature became aroused, and he went into the fight with all his energy. With a strong force he invested Fort Prince George, and Fort Loudon, and soon reduced the garrison of the latter place to the fearful alternative of perishing by hun ger, or submitting to the mercy of infuriated savages. For a whole month the two hundred men within the fort subsisted on half-starved horses and dogs, and a few measures of an Indian bean, stealthily supplied them by some friendly squaws. Captain John Stuart, an officer of great address and sagacity, and much beloved among the Cherokees, was then commissioned by the garrison to proceed to Echota, and make the best terms of surrender possible with Oconostota. The chief consented that the officers and men should march out with their arms, and be allowed unmolested passage to Virginia or Fort Prince George, and agreed that an Indian escort should go with them to provide game for the journey. He himself accompanied them during the first day's march. At night the English encamped about fifteen miles from the fort, near the Indian town of Tellico. There Oconostota left them, and soon, one by one, and on vari ous pretexts, the Indian escort slunk away through the woods to the neighboring Indian village. This excited Captain Stuart's suspicions, and, fearing treachery, he set a strict guard over the encampment. The night passed away without an attack ; but just before dawn, when all were locked in the soundest sleep, a sentry rushed up to"], [53, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 33 Stuart with the alarm that the woods were full of Indi ans, advancing stealthily to surround the two hundred sleeping soldiers. Stuart called all \"to arms\" ; but, be fore one half of the men were fully awake, a heavy volley was poured in upon them from the woods in all direc tions. Panic-stricken, and debilitated by long fasting, the soldiers made but a feeble resistance, and in a few min utes the butchery was over. Accounts differ as to the number slain. Hewitt, writing in 1799, gives the total at three officers and twenty-six privates ; Haywood, writ ing not much later, states that none escaped except Cap tain Stuart, an Indian-trader named Isaac Thomas, and one other, a private soldier. This last is the account generally accepted. Captain Stuart would undoubtedly have been mas sacred at once but for his general popularity among the Indians. As it was, he was securely pinioned, and marched back to Fort Loudon, there to have his fate decided. Atta-Culla-Culla was his devoted friend. He was not present at the surrender, nor at the massacre ; but, as soon as he heard of the captivity of Stuart, he hastened to the fort, and ransomed him from his captors, giving for his release \" his rifle, his clothes, and all he could command.\" Had Stuart fallen in this Indian massacre, eight years of bloody warfare might have been saved to the border settlements. Thus it is that often upon one life bangs the fate of thousands. There is no question that Ocon ostota planned and instigated the massacre. It accords"], [54, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 34 with his character, which was crafty, cruel, and treach erous, and he had now become greatly imbittered against the English. Atta-Culla-Culla took Stuart into his own lodgings at the fort, and shared with him his rations. But, though under the powerful protection of the vice-king, Stuart was not yet out of danger. Ten bags of gunpowder had been found buried in the grounds of the fort ; and he was charged with secreting them from the Indians. The result would have been instant massacre but for the timely interference of Atta-Culla-Culla, and the presence of mind of the interpreter, who declared that Stuart had no knowledge of the concealment. Oconostota, having now a supply of ammunition, de cided upon laying immediate siege to the fort on the head-waters of the Savannah. Dispatching runners in all directions to raise his warriors, he told Stuart that he must accompany the expedition, manage the six captured guns that were to compose his artillery, and write such letters as he should dictate to the English commandant. On Stuart's refusing to engage in this fratricidal work, the chief reminded him that the Indians had spared his life, and thus acquired a title to his services. On his con tinued refusal, Oconostota told him that, should he re main obstinate, he would take him upon the expedition by force, and, if the garrison refused to surrender at the first summons, he would make a bonfire of his body in the sight of his friends, and see if they would hold out while he was roasting in the flames."], [55, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 35 On the instant Stuart decided to make his escape or perish in the attempt. He apprised Atta-Culla-Culla of his design, when the noble savage took him by the hand, assured him that he was his friend, and at the risk of his life would deliver him from his captors. To do this, he resorted to stratagem. Giving out that he was going on a few days' hunt, he took with him his wife, his brother, and his prisoner, and, when once out of sight of the fort, shaped his course direct for Virginia. The distance was great, and the utmost expedition was neces sary to escape a pursuit that might be made by Oconos tota. Nine days and nights they journeyed, guided only by the sun by day and the moon by night ; but, on the tenth day, after a most toilsome and dangerous march, they fell in with a detachment of three hundred men sent out by the English for the relief of Fort Loudon, and, on the fourteenth day, they reached the British headquarters on the frontier of Virginia. Captain Stu art was now among friends. He loaded Atta-Culla-Culla with presents and provisions, and sent him back with overtures of peace to the Cherokees. How Atta-Culla- Culla was received on his return to his tribe is not re corded, but his influence among them was not perma nently weakened, for he continued to exercise for many years his functions of vice-royalty. Canada being now reduced, an adequate British force was sent from the sNorth to chastise the Cherokees for their bloody treachery. Hearing of their approach, Atta-Culla-Culla appeared in their camp to deprecate the"], [56, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 36 vengeance about to be wreaked upon his people. He was told that the English had the highest regard for him personally, but that the misconduct of Oconostota and the majority of the nation was too gross to go unpun ished. The army marched into the heart of the Cherokee country ; the Indians made a desperate stand, but were routed with great slaughter. Fourteen of their towns were burned, their corn, cattle, and provisions destroyed, and they and their families \"were driven to seek shelter and subsistence among the barren mountains.\" In a few days Atta-Culla-Culla appeared again in the English camp. \"My people,\" he said, \"are in great distress ; I am come to see what can be done for them.\" His proposals were now listened to, and, out of regard for him, a treaty was concluded highly favorable to the Cherokees, who, taught by their disasters to dread the power of the English, never again swerved from their allegiance to King George. Two years later it was deemed advisable by the Eng lish government to appoint a general agent and super intendent of Indian affairs at the South. Owing partly to the intervention of Atta-Culla-Culla, but more to his known sagacity and influence over the native tribes, Captain John Stuart, who so barely escaped at the Tellico massacre, was appointed to this office. It was a position of great influence, as it gave Stuart practically control of all the savages on the frontier. He appointed deputies to reside with each of the tribes, who should"], [57, "ENGLAND'S ALLIES. 37 constantly report to him the state of affairs ; and we shall soon see that his energy, sagacity, and devotion to the service of his government made him a most powerful enemy of the revolted colonies. And it was he who conceived the plan, which was adopted by the British cabinet, for the complete sup pression, by one united blow, of the revolutionary rebel lion. On three different occasions, at intervals of years, the English attempted to carry this plan into execution : first under Sir William Howe, and then twice under Sir Henry Clinton, and on each occasion they were, in the providence of God, thwarted by the great character who is the principal actor in this history. It was a bold, able, gigantic scheme, and yet we may look into a dozen encyclop\u00e6dias and not find the merest mention of John Stuart, captain in the British Highlanders. And it was a bold, far-reaching, and, considering his means, a won derful achievement, but I venture to say that very few, except diligent students of American history, have ever so much as heard of John Sevier, the heroic Nolichucky Jack of the Border."], [58, "CHAPTER II. THE FIEST SETTLERS. Daniel Boone made his first excursion beyond the Alleghanies in 1760, the record of which, as I have men tioned, is still to be seen on a beech-tree near the Wa tauga. He was enchanted with the country. To him it seemed a new world, more genial in climate, beautiful in scenery, and magnificent in resources than any of which he had ever conceived. He told the wonderful story when he returned to his home on the banks of the Yadkin ; but his tale fell on incredulous ears. The farmers of that region, accustomed to a thin, sandy soil, producing only a scanty growth of slender pines, could not believe in a yellow loam four feet in depth, and bearing dense forests of oak and poplar, often ten feet in diameter, and towering aloft a hundred feet be fore they broke into branches. They did not credit the wonderful story until it had been confirmed by a young farmer, selected by themselves to accompany Boone on his third exploration in 1769. Boone's second visit was in 1764 ; and again his glow ing accounts of the new country fell generally upon deaf ears, though North Carolina was then groaning under"], [59, "THE FIRST SETTLEES. 39 the exactions of the colonial governor, Tryon, and dis content was festering everywhere throughout the eastern counties. But, if Boone failed to arouse a passion for emigration among the farmers, he excited a spirit of speculation in the wealthier classes, which led to the formation of a company for the purpose of buying from the Indians a large part of Tennessee and the whole of Kentucky. At the head of this company was Colonel Richard Henderson, a judge of the supreme court of the colony, but who had recently resigned out of sympa thy with the Regulators, who in North Carolina were already lighting the fire of revolution. He conceived the magnificent project of founding a commonwealth beyond the mountains, on the model of that of William Penn, to which he would give the name of Transylvania. His scheme failed, through no fault of his own, but he became an extensive land proprietor, and achieved a cer tain sort of celebrity among the whites as the \" Treaty maker,\" and among the Indians as \"Slippery Dick.\" He decided upon a full exploration of his intended com monwealth, and to this end employed Boone and a hunter named Henry Scaggins to visit the new territory. Boone was to penetrate into Kentucky as far north as the Kentucky River ; Scaggins to take a route farther south, following the windings of the Cumberland ; and both were to report to Henderson before any bargain was consummated with the Indians. The two explorers set out together, in company with John Findley, John Stewart, and two other hunt-"], [60, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 40 ers, on the first day of May, 1769, and with them went the young farmer already mentioned. He had been deputed by a number of his neighbors to find \"good springs and rich lands, and enough of both to accom modate them all,\" where they could form a community of friends, free from political oppression, and the in solence of the \" red-coated minions \" of \" the great he wolf of Carolina,\" Governor Tryon. The history of Western civilization can not be written without fre quent mention of this young farmer ; but he had at this time no revelation of his future, nor any higher aim in life than to make a home for himself, his wife and child, in some new region where he might acquire a competence, and rise, perhaps, to a position of some consideration in a small rural community. Therefore I need at present say nothing more of him than that his name was James Robertson, and he was born in Brunswick County, Virginia, of Scotch-Irish parents, on the 28th of June, 1742, and that, at the age of twenty-five, he had married Charlotte R. Reeves, a woman nine years his junior, but every way worthy to be his wife. This much premised, I will now go on with him, and the party of Boone, in his first journey over the Alleghanies. His equipment was a horse, a blanket, a hatchet, and a hunting-knife. Over his shoulder was slung a long Deckard rifle, a powder-horn, and a bag of bul lets, and on the horse behind him were balanced a sack well filled with parched corn, a package of salt,"], [61, "THE FIEST SETTLERS. 41 and a tin cup for drinking purposes. This was his entire outfit. On the parched corn, and the game to be procured by his rifle, he was to subsist on his journey. The party followed the trail hitherto taken by Boone, for there was no road, nor even a bridle-path. After leaving the settlements, their way led through an unbroken forest ; but there was no difficulty in keeping the trail, for it had been carefully blazed by Boone on his previous journeys. At night they encamped under some spreading tree, and, tethering their horses among the timber, lighted a fire with the extra flint which each one carried in his bullet-pouch. Their mode of light ing a fire is peculiar to the backwoodsman. A handful of dry grass or leaves is gathered, then twisted into a nest, in which is placed a piece of ignited punk. Then the grass is closed over the punk, and the ball waved in the air till it breaks into a blaze, when it readily ignites the bundle of dry sticks with which the fire is kindled. The limbs of dead trees are then heaped upon the blaze, and one of the travelers sets about preparing supper for the whole party. It is probably of deer, for they are plenty in that region. As soon as the burning logs have deposited a good bed of ashes, a hole is scooped in them, and in it is deposited the portion of venison intended to be eaten. When the meat is suffi ciently done, it is taken out, the ashes are knocked away, and then \u2014 no civilized man, whose appetite has never been sharpened by open-air exposure in the woods,"], [62, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 42 can understand the avidity with which the delicious viand is consumed. Supper over, each traveler lights his pipe of fra grant \" Kinnikinnick,\" and the evening is most likely whiled away in pleasant talk, and narrative of \"mov ing accident \" by field and forest. Boone was a good narrator, and though but five years the senior of Robert son, had already a large experience of thrilling advent ure. At last, heaping fresh logs upon the fire, to keep up the blaze till morning, and scare away the wolves and panthers that might be attracted by the scent of the venison, the travelers would spread their blankets upon the ground, turn their feet to the fire, and sink into slumber. Thus they encamped by night, and journeyed by day, till they reached the foot of the long incline that stretches to the base of the Stone Mountains \u2014 the northerly portion of the long range which is now the boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina. It is a good day's journey to the summit ; so it is well nigh certain that the explorers halted here, encamped for the night, and resumed their way in the morning. The path up the incline is not hard to ascend; but when they came to the base of the ridge they were met by a huge escarpment of rocks, towering above them hun dreds of feet, which seemed to bar all farther progress. But Boone and Findley had been that way before ; they knew a path the deer had traveled, and where the deer had led these active, strong-limbed men could follow."], [63, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 43 Keeping along the base of the precipice, they soon came to a pass which to any but a backwoodsman would seem insurmountable. Here they dismounted, and, cutting some stout saplings to serve as Alpenstocks, began the toilsome ascent. Over stumps, over stones, over fallen trees they went, leading their sure-footed beasts by the bridle, and often climbing some acclivity so steep that they were unable to stand upright ; but at last they reached the summit, nearly a mile above the level of the ocean. And then a view broke upon them such as Robertson, accustomed as he was to the comparatively tame scenery of Wake County, had never beheld. Standing where they stood \u2014 where the swift Watauga rushes down the side of the mountain \u2014 we may easily picture to ourselves the scene that met the eyes of the explorers. Spread out at their feet was a beautiful valley, some thirty miles in length by twenty in width, covered with a luxuriant forest, broken here and there by grassy openings. In one of these openings \u2014 the \" Watauga Old Fields \" of the pioneers, larger than the rest, and some twenty miles away \u2014 two small rivers united their currents, and flow to gether to the west through a gap in the encircling mount ains. Tracing their course up among the hills, the ex plorers caught glimpses of numerous smaller streams which feed the larger ones, and water the whole of the enchanting region. The valley, which is itself two thou sand feet above the sea, is hemmed in by huge mount ain-ranges, the Holston on the north and west, and the"], [64, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 44 Iron and Stone Mountains on the south and east, which break into peaks\u2014 the White-Top, the Bald, and the Roan \u2014 the lowest of which towers more than a mile into the air. These mountains protect the valley from the winter winds, and temper the summer breezes to a deli cious coolness, making the climate the most delightful that can be imagined. The bottoms along the rivers are wide and productive, bearing then a thick crop of tall grass, on which multitudes of deer, elk, and buffalo were browsing. The soil of the bottoms is a deep, dark loam, capable of yielding immense crops of wheat and Indian corn, while the higher and less fertile land along the base of the mountains produces fruits of the most delicate flavor, and in astonishing abundance. Altogether the scene is picturesque beyond descrip tion : a charming valley, threaded by limpid streams, and dotted with dense forests of oak, pine, poplar, cherry, and walnut ; the whole encircled by huge sandstone ridges, their loftier peaks capped by the clouds, and standing there grim, silent, and sublime, like giant senti nels guarding the gates of an earthly paradise. Years afterward, speaking of this scene as it then broke upon him, Robertson said, \" It seemed to me the ' Promised Land.' \" As the explorers prepared to descend into the valley they observed, a few miles away at the north, a slight smoke curling up from among the trees, near the banks of what is now known as Boone's Creek, a small tribu tary of the Watauga. Was it from the encampment"], [65, "THE FIRST SETTLEES. 45 of some Indian hunter, or the cabin of a white man, who had settled there since the visit of Boone five years before ? With the caution of old hunters they descended the mountain, and approached the spot whence the smoke issued. It was a log hut newly built, and around it, in the stacked corn and the cattle browsing near, were evidences of a white inhabitant. He was a former comrade of Boone, his companion dur ing his visit in 1760, and he had returned within the previous summer, and built here a home for his family. His name was William Bean, and he was the first white settler west of the Alleghanies. The explorers were hospitably entertained by Bean and his wife ; but after a few days spent in piloting Rob ertson about the valley, Boone set out on his first long tramp through Kentucky. On the seventh of June his small party reached the Red River, the most northerly branch of the Kentucky ; and there Stewart was killed by the Indians, the first victim, so far as is known, in that long contest with the aborigines which gained for the territory south of the Ohio the name of the \"dark and bloody ground.\" Boone escaped, but he did not again appear among civilized men till 1772, and then he once more came in contact with Robertson. Robertson remained behind on the Watauga, and was not long in deciding that he had happened upon the right spot for a settlement. This decided on, he set about making preparations for the incoming settlers. Selecting a spot of fertile soil, he broke it up, and"], [66, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 46 planted a crop of corn, enough to carry the expected colonists through their first season ; meanwhile making his home with Bean, the hospitable first settler, and with a hunter named Honeycut, who had erected a rude hut near the Watauga. It was autumn before his corn was gathered, and the rainy reason had set in when he started to return to North Carolina. He had carefully husbanded his small stock of powder and lead, and with what remained, and enough parched corn and jerked venison to last, with the game he might kill, for ten or more days, he set out on his solitary homeward journey. A heavy rain soon came on, which drenched him completely, and, worse than this, wet through and through every ounce of his powder. Wrapping his blanket closely about him, he tried to dry the powder with the warmth of his naked flesh ; but all his efforts were unavailing \u2014 the precious grains had totally lost the power of ignition. Reduced now to his prepared food, he pushed on with all speed to reach, before his supply should be exhausted, the settlements on the other side of the mountain. Along the westerly part of the route the explorers had neglected to blaze the way, and now, day after day, the sun was hidden by thick clouds ; but Robertson had no difficulty so long as he could take his bearings by the course of the Watauga. But when he had passed the sources of that stream he was all at sea, with neither sun, nor star, nor compass to guide him. He scanned the heavens with anxious eye ; but they dis-"], [67, "THE FIEST SETTLERS. 47 closed no glimpse of the blessed sun : all was mist and rain by day, and by night the blackest of darkness. Tired, drenched, bewildered, he wandered aimlessly on, lost, completely lost, in an almost interminable forest. His food, too, was fast running low, and the scant herbage still left among the trees would no longer sus tain his jaded animal. Then he turned the trusty beast adrift to find its own way out of starvation. He had eked out his scanty provisions with the nuts of the beech and the chestnut, but now this resource was exhausted ; his last handful, too, of corn was con sumed, and he was in a region of rocks and precipices \u2014 probably near the western base of Yellow Mountain \u2014 where nothing grew that would sustain life. Then, ex hausted nature could hold out no longer. His strength was gone ; he could not articulate above a whisper ; and, sinking down at the foot of a cliff, he resigned himself to the inevitable. How long he lay there he never told, and perhaps never knew ; but at last, when his senses were nearly gone, he heard voices, and then approaching footsteps. They were two hunters \u2014 probably the only two human beings within a radius of a hundred miles. They came di rectly to the spot where he was lying, but did not see him till actually upon him. Dismounting from their horses, they lifted him in their arms, revived him with some spirits, and then, sparingly at first, ministered to him of the food in their knapsacks. Slowly his strength re turned ; but they stayed by him, and, when he was able"], [68, "REAR-GUAED OF THE REVOLUTION. 48 to mount, seated him on one of their horses, and guided him out of the mountain, and for more than fifty miles on his way to the settlements. Then the good Samaritans went as they came, into the wide forest, leaving not even their names to a wondering tradition. Robertson's neighbors were fascinated with the de scription which he gave of the country he had explored. To them the sterile plains and rocky uplands of Wake County lost their attractions when compared with the fertile valley which he pictured, and sixteen heads of families prepared to go with him, in the following spring, to a new home west of the mountains. When the March rains were over they set out \u2014 about eighty souls \u2014 men, women, and children. They journeyed slowly, the men mostly on foot, the women on pack horses, with the younger children in their arms or strapped upon the horses behind them, and the older ones trudging along by the side of their fathers or aid ing to drive the neat cattle, a score or more of which were the advance-guard of the cavalcade. The outfit of the party was simple. The men carried the usual equip ments of the hunter ; the women some light articles of clothing ; and, loaded on several led horses, were such bedding and kitchen utensils as would be needed at the end of the journey. They followed the route taken by the explorers, sleeping at night on the ground, beneath the open sky, or sheltered by an improvised tent, made of two forked poles thrust into the ground, and supporting a longer"], [69, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 49 pole, over which was stretched a heavy blanket. Should it rain, these tents were quickly pitched, and all the trav elers were soon under shelter. At the halting-place for the night a fire was built, the cows were milked, the journey-boards unpacked, and the delicious journey-cake \u2014 misnamed \"Johnny-cake\" \u2014 was set before the fire or baked in the ashes. To this was added the deer or wild turkey shot by the men during the day ; and they had a repast \"fit to set before a king.\" The same was done before setting out in the morning ; but at noon only a short halt was made for rest, and a cold lunch from the remains of the breakfast. Thus they journeyed for about ten days, until they reached the base of the Yellow Mountain. Here they struck into a deep cove which indents the mountain side, and climbed by a winding route, but by easy stages, to the summit. Robertson rode by the side of his wife, and in front was their child, now a bright little fellow of two or three years. Later on he will appear again in our pages, and then disappear forever from human history. As they wearily climbed the toilsome way, and paused to rest, as they probably did, at the summit, would not that young wife and mother look forward with a vague foreboding into the tangled wilderness that lay before her ? And could she have seen the hardships and dangers that were there \u2014 the rain of bullets that fell about her at Watauga, the frail boat that bore her a thou sand miles through untold dangers into a still more dis tant wilderness, and to a home encircled by savage fire, 3"], [70, "REAR-GUARD OF THE EEVOLUTION. 50 by whose blackened hearth the babe at her breast would be laid scalped and dying at her feet\u2014 could she have seen all this, would she not have turned back? She might ; but still I think she would not, for Spartan women, as well as Spartan men, were among these first settlers, and one of these women was Charlotte Robert son. As they began the descent of the western slope of Stone Mountain an unexpected scene met the eyes of Robertson. When he had left it in the previous autumn the valley was an almost unbroken solitude ; now the smoke was rising from half a score of cabins, about which were all the evidences of civilization. Men were plowing the fields or felling the trees, women were en gaged in various domestic vocations, and children were gamboling among the trees, or watching the nimble squirrels as they chased one another from branch to branch of the lofty oaks or walnuts. Nearly half a hundred settlers were there, and the place was already a busy community. We may easily imagine the joy that spread through the settlement on the arrival of the new-comers. They were total strangers, but they were of the same blood, and their advent would make less dreary that lonely nook beyond the mountains. There was not house-room for the large influx of strangers, but the spring weather was mild and genial, and they could encamp under the spreading trees until half-faced cabins were erected for their temporary shel-"], [71, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 51 ter. These cabins were built of split saplings, one end resting on the ground, the other supported by a frame of forked poles about high enough for a man to enter standing upright. They were open at the front, but the sides and rear were covered with thick blankets, so as to afford shelter and privacy. Of no recognized order of civilized architecture, they served to keep out wind and rain, and under them, on blankets, or now and then on the precious feather-bed spread on the ground, the tired immigrants might sleep as soundly as the renowned Sancho Panza, of sleepy memory. Their food was supplied from the store of corn so providently provided by Robertson on his previous visit, and from the deer, buffalo, or wild turkey brought down by the unerring riflemen among them. On deer and wild turkey they had regaled before, but buffalo meat was a delicacy with which they were not acquainted, and its rich, juicy, tender steak once tasted, all other meat lost half its flavor. None of them had ever even seen the animal, and we may imagine the wonder with which they first beheld the vast herds that almost darkened the valley. Lolling in the shade of the trees, or crop ping leisurely the thick grass of the \"openings,\" their coal-black beards sweeping the ground, and their long tails lashing their sleek, dun sides, the noble beasts gazed unconcernedly on the intruders, totally unconscious that this slender biped, with the slim, smoke-breathing tube he bore in his hand, was ere long to well-nigh extermi nate the lordly race, and drive its scanty remnant far west"], [72, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 52 to the Rocky Mountains. They were an easy prey to the early hunter, and thus the rude larders of the first settlers were filled to abundance. Their wives and children provided with temporary shelter, the immigrants looked about for locations for more permanent dwellings. Virginia offered to every actual settler who should erect a log-cabin and cultivate a small patch of ground, four hundred acres \u2014 so located as to include his improvements \u2014 together with the right to buy a thousand acres adjoining at a price scarcely more than enough to cover the cost of surveying. The immigrants knew they were near the North Carolina boundary, but they supposed they were north of the line which starts \" at a white stake on the Atlantic Ocean, at north 36\u00b0 30', and runs thence west to the South Seas,\" and thus were within the limits of Virginia, and entitled to avail themselves of its cheap munificence \u2014 cheap be cause the whole territory had been bought by George III from the Six Nations for a few trinkets, the total value of which did not exceed the cost of the wedding outfit of a modern lady of fashion. The English had thus, when it would no longer serve their purpose, tacitly abandoned the discovery title, and admitted some sort of ownership in the original occu piers of the territory. This purchase was called the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, and it was made at that place \u2014now Rome, New York\u2014 November 5, 1768 ; but it gave no title to land south of latitude 36\u00b0 30', which was the southern boundary of Virginia. All south of"], [73, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 53 that line was as yet conceded to be the rightful posses sion of the original owners. This line, \" west to the South Seas,\" had not then been run farther west than the \" Steep Rock,\" near the White Top Mountain. When it was subsequently ex tended, the settlers found themselves within the limits of North Carolina, and not entitled to the benefit of the Virginia law. But of this more hereafter. Now they were unconscious of encroaching on any rights of white man or red, and they went on with their improvements, confident they were acquiring an indefeasible title to their new possessions. The settlers whom Robertson found at Watauga were mostly from Fairfax County, Virginia, and they had been attracted there by reports of the country heard from parties of gentlemen who had visited it on hunting expeditions. Like their associates from North Carolina, these people belonged mostly to the farming population. They all were somewhat unpolished in manner, and not much acquainted with books, but not illiterate, for, in a document subscribed soon afterward by more than a hun dred of them, only two names are signed with a cross. They brought with them but few worldly goods, but they had that which in a new community is more truly wealth \u2014 frugal and industrious habits, enterprise, firm self-reliance, and the cool intrepidity that is fostered by frequent exposure to danger. No better material could have been selected to subdue the Western wilderness. Soon the little settlement, nestling there among the"], [74, "54 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. mountains, presented a stirring appearance. The set tlers now numbered, all told, about thirty men able to wield an ax or handle a rifle ; and, the locations of the new-comers being decided on, they all set about the erection of their dwellings. Trees were felled, cut into logs, hewn into joist, split into flooring, and rived into shingles, and, in an incredibly short time, the various families were domiciled in their new abodes. If we look in upon one of these cabins we shall be able to form a tolerably correct idea of the homes of the early settlers on the Watauga. They were generally one and a half story high, about twenty feet square, and of rough logs, chamfered at the ends, so as to fit closely together. They had a solid plank door, hung on wooden hinges, and two or three small windows, formed by sawing through one or two of the outer logs. These windows were entirely open, or inclosed with a stout blind, and glazed with thick paper saturated with bear's grease to render it transparent ; but the larger number of the cabins, if destitute of glazing, were furnished with blinds, as they were necessary as a protec tion against intruders. The roof was covered with large split saplings, held down by long weight-poles, and the floors were puncheons \u2014 wide pieces of oak or poplar, two or three inches thick, split and hewn with an ax, and laid upon sleepers. If the hewing is well done, such floors are as level and smooth as if fashioned of machine made material. The chimney was of sticks or stones laid up in clay, and it went up on the outside, in a pyram-"], [75, "THE FIEST SETTLEES. 55 idal form, and of a size totally disproportioned to the dwelling ; for these people were fond of a wide, roaring fire in winter, and in summer the huge flue was the best of all ventilators. If it is added that the roof of some of these cabins was extended in front, so as to cover a wide veranda, and that the bark and moss were left clinging to the logs, which by another season would be covered with honeysuckles and the Virginia creeper, we shall see that the hamlet would soon present no unpicturesque appearance. The interiors need only a brief description. They were generally of two rooms \u2014 one below, the other above \u2014 approached by a ladder in a corner. The lower room was parlor, kitchen, and often bedroom. The fire place was deep and wide, surmounted, perhaps, by a broad mantel of unpainted oak, on which were a few trinkets and the violin so precious to the backwoodsman. In one corner was a spinning-jenny, in another an uncushioned settle, and, opposite the fire-place, a bureau or chest of drawers of native wood and home manufact ure. These, with a small table, a few chairs with rustic frames and deer-skin coverings, also of home manufact ure, and a couple of forked sticks nailed to one of the logs and supporting the trusty rifle, probably completed the furniture of the apartment. This is the description of the smaller houses. Oth ers, adapted to larger families, were what were termed \"double-barreled\" cabins, having two rooms on the ground-floor separated by an open passage-way, and a"], [76, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 56 \"lean-to \" in the rear to serve as a kitchen. Still others, it may be, were like the later mansion of John Sevier \u2014 half a dozen single cabins, tacked one upon the other, and covering space enough to serve for the foundation of a cathedral. From these details we can easily form for ourselves a picture of the first civilized settlement beyond the Alle ghanies. A score or more of these cabins were scattered, here aud there, in the very heart of the forest, the great trees crowding so closely around them as often to over hang their very roofs. Near them horses and cattle were grazing on the thick, native grass that grew among the trees, or housed in rude sheds at the rear of the dwellings ; while farther away, along the margin of the many streams, deer and elk and buffalo were brows ing. Glimpses of footpaths, leading from one widely sepa rated dwelling to another, might be here and there seen ; but there were no roads, for no wheeled vehicle had yet invaded this sylvan solitude. These simple features furnish the outlines of the picture ; the details any one familiar with forest life can fill in from his own imagi nation. And so these people dwelt in peace, content, and opulence ; for this last is merely the condition of having something more than enough, and this they had in abundance. They were afflicted with no artificial wants, drank no tea, coffee, or ardent spirits, and ate no wheat bread nor delicate food, hut were content with spring-"], [77, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 57 water, \" corn-dodger,\" bear's meat, buffalo-tongue, veni son saddle, and venison ham \u2014 broiled, stewed, fried, and jerked \u2014 and, as a great delicacy, green-corn roasted and coated with sugar from the sap of the maple-tree. The women cared nothing for the latest fashions, but, like their husbands, dressed in homespun of their own spin ning and weaving, and deemed a house full of rosy sons and daughters the best of earthly possessions. They were not \" lay figures \" to exhibit some milliner's or jeweler's stock in trade, but actual \"helps meet for their hus bands.\" They shared the good man's cares, lightened his labors, and spread daily joy over his rustic house hold. And the men were a manly race \u2014 honest, open handed, fearless, independent. Open-air exercise gave them health, and, there being ample room for all, the ad vent of a new-comer was welcomed as adding to the gen eral security. There was among them none of that small envy and jealousy which contributes so largely to human misery, particularly in older rural communities. There was no end to their social gatherings. The men came together for the bear-hunt, the deer-drive, the shooting-match, and for foot and horse racing ; and men and women met at quilting-bees, corn-shuckings, maple-sugar stirrings, and the old-fashioned dancing \"shindies,\" when the fiddle would twang merrily into the small hours, and the lads and lasses would \" dance all night till broad daylight.\" Many a rustic heart was lost and won on such occasions, and at the \" stirrings-off \" in the sugar-camps, which were great gatherings in the"], [78, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 58 woods, when the sirup had been boiled down to a consist ence to allow it to be \" stirred-off \" into sugar. Then many a rustic youth, sitting on a log beside a blue-eyed or raven-haired lass, would, in words sweeter than the honeyed sirup \u2014 \" Strive hard to persuade her, That He who had made her, Had destined her heart-love for no one but he ; And he argued so neatly, And proved so completely That none but poor Andrew her husband should be ; That she smiled when he blessed her, And blushed when he kissed her, And owned that she loved, and would wed none but he.\" It was a simple state of society, but it was a happy one. There was no law, nor was there need of any, for there was not a lawyer in the whole community. Every man did what was right in his own eyes, but crime was a thing unknown among them. Every man also was the equal of every other man. There were no artificial dis tinctions. Good feeling, natural civility, and sterling qualities of head and heart were the passports to social consideration. Without them a man would be friend less, and to say that of him, in a society of mutual good will and fellowship, was equivalent to calling him a scoundrel. It was the height of indignity to omit to ask a neighbor to a raising, a clearing, or a chopping frolic. \"It is a poor dog that is not worth whist ling for,\" said a neighbor who was not invited to a"], [79, "THE FIRST SETTLERS. 59 house-raising going on in the neighborhood. \" What in jury have I done that I am slighted so ?\" This was the state of things among the first settlers on the Watauga, while there was as yet not a church nor a school-house among them, and before one of that grand race of men, who carried their homes in their saddle-bags, and their libraries under their broad-brimmed white beavers \u2014 the Methodist circuit-riders \u2014 had climbed the Alleghanies. The settlers had a few books, among which were the Bible, Watt's and Rippon's Hymns, Dil worth's Spelling Book, Fox's \"Book of Martyrs,\" \" Robinson Crusoe,\" and the \" Pilgrim's Progress \" ; and these Robertson was fond of reading to the people around the evening fire, particularly the Bible. From this book he often quoted in ordinary conversation, his favorite text being, \"Man proposes, but God disposes,\" which saying of Thomas a Kempis, he always insisted, is to be found somewhere in the book of Job. Writing paper was so scarce a commodity among them, that im portant contracts were often written on the fly-leaf of a family Bible, and with ink made of gunpowder. Before long the settlers numbered about two hundred souls, and forty able-bodied men ; but they were shut out from the civilized world by a high mountain barrier, and surrounded on every other side by at least a hundred thousand savages, who were by nature and instinct the enemies of the white man. Both North Carolina and Virginia claimed jurisdiction over them ; but the claim never extended beyond some slight discussion in state"], [80, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 60 papers, and neither colony afforded them any protection. They were absolutely self-dependent, an unsupported outpost on the very verge of civilization. How this handful of men, women, and children came to venture upon such dangerous ground, or, being there, escaped total extermination, is one of the miracles of history. They realized their exposed position, and understood the na ture of the North American Indian, but they went cheer fully about their daily pursuits \u2014 tilling the soil, plant ing, and harvesting, and \" gathering into barns,\" or, more correctly, into ricks, for as yet they had no barns \u2014 unmo lested by the Indians, and in harmony with one another, for two full years of genuine peace, comfort, and security."], [81, "CHAPTER III. ON THE OUTPOSTS. Havikg now prepared the stage, it is time for the prompter to ring up the curtain and call upon it the actors who are to take parts in this first scene of the great drama which is to be enacted in the wilderness. The theatre is only a barn, and the performers are merely a band of strollers, but the spectator will soon see that they are great actors, and the play the first act in a grand drama that may not be played out for centu ries \u2014 not, at least, until civilization shall have overspread the whole vast continent west of the Alleghanies. By that silent suffrage, according to which every man is speedily elected to his true place in a new community, the young farmer, Robertson, was soon given the lead ing position in the Watauga settlement. There were older men than he among the settlers, and those better bred and better educated, but it soon came to be under stood that he possessed the qualities that peculiarly fitted him for leadership ; and so he was tacitly recognized as the head man in the little community, and looked up to and obeyed accordingly. He was at this time not quite thirty years of age."], [82, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 62 His personal appearance at a later date is described by an aged granddaughter, writing more than a century after ward, as follows: \"He was,\" she writes, \"about five feet nine inches in height, heavy built, but not too fat. His head inclined slightly forward, so that his light-blue eyes were usually shaded by his heavy eyebrows. His hair was very dark \u2014 like a mole in color \u2014 and his com plexion, though naturally very fair, was darkened and reddened by exposure. I remember him as being uncom monly quiet and thoughtful, and full of the cares of business. We all loved and venerated him.\" * From other sources I gather that, at this earlier pe riod, his frame was robust, well-knit, and wiry, but not what would be termed \"heavy built\"; and that he had prominent features, and a square, full forehead, which rose in the coronal region into an almost abnormal development ; also, that he was earnest, taciturn, self contained, and had that quiet consciousness of power which is usually seen in born leaders of men. Yet his manner was without arrogance or self-assumption. On the contrary, he was extremely courteous and concilia tory, with that rare blending of self-respect and defer ence to others which repels undue familiarity, but, at the same time, wins friendship, and puts the rudest at his ease. Oconostota, who was a shrewd observer of men, and for twenty-five years Robertson's inveterate enemy, said of him, \"He has winning ways, and he * Mrs. Cheatharo, of Nashville, Tennessee, 1880."], [83, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 63 makes no fuss.\" Adding merely that he was cool, care ful of consequences, and watchful of danger, but also bold, fearless, and ever ready to undertake enterprises that would stagger men of fewer mental resources, I will leave his character to further develop itself as he acts his part in this history. Robertson had no official position, for as yet the little community had no civil organization, and, consequent ly, he had all the cares and responsibilities with none of the emoluments and perquisites which modern politi cians regard as such important adjuncts to official station. And, worse than this, his private purse was constantly drained by his public position, for he was forced to keep open house to the throng of strangers who constantly came to the settlement, either to make it their home, or to view with curious interest the eyrie of this lone eagle that had thus built his nest on the outer cliffs of the overhanging Alleghanies. Therefore it was that Robert son's house, on the upper end of the island in the Wa tauga, near what is now Elizabethtown, though of logs like the others, was by far the most commodious dwell ing in the settlement. To this house there rode up one day, in 1772 \u2014 not quite two years after Robertson had led his colony over the mountains \u2014 three horsemen, each of whom was to act a more or less important part in Western history. They were all strangers to Robertson, but, with true border hospitality, he invited them to dis mount and enter his dwelling. While they do so, I will give as full a description of them as I have been able"], [84, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 64 to gather from some scanty written accounts and num berless oral traditions. The oldest was a man rather more than fifty years of age, with a robust but sinewy frame, and an erect mili tary carriage. He had thick gray hair and heavy Welsh features \u2014 in fact, he was a native Welshman, hut he came to this country so early in life that he had fully acquired the language and habits of the men of the bor der. His military career of thirty years had given him a stern, imperious manner, which cropped out on all occasions, and was strikingly shown, two years later, when he said to the son who was now with him, as the young man sat down to wait while his commission as lieutenant was being written by Colonel William Preston, the commandant of Fincastle County, \"Get up, you young dog, and make your obeisance to the colonel ! \" He had been a prominent actor in the old French and Indian wars, and was well and widely known throughout the Southern colonies. In these halcyon days of peace he had laid aside his military rank, and he was now, with his four manly boys, extensively engaged in the herding and grazing of cattle on the Virginia border, some forty miles to the north of Watauga, at a place called King's Meadows, now Bristol, Tennessee. He was Captain Evan Shelby, of the Virginia line, subsequently General Shelby, of the Revolutionary army. His eldest son, now with him, was the counterpart of the father, though built upon a larger scale both in body and mind. He had the same herculean frame, the same"], [85, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 65 firm, compressed lips, double chin, and heavy features, but in his fixed, deep-set, resolute eye there was a steady glow that spoke a much more exalted character. He was now barely turned of twenty-one, but he had already established a character for uncommon intelligence, and stern, unbending integrity, that had made him to be looked upon as a rising man upon the border. I shall have to speak of him again, for this was Isaac Shelby, one of the heroes of King's Mountain, and the first Gov ernor of Kentucky. But in the third stranger this history has a deeper interest. He was a young man of only twenty-six, and had not yet achieved any especial distinction, but he was of a personal appearance so marked that he would have been observed and commented on in any gathering of men on the continent. Often afterward he was singled out in crowds of five thousand, by total strangers, who had merely been told that he was present. He was not so large of frame as the others, but one glance was enough to show that he was of a different and far higher type of character. He is said to have weighed not far from one hundred and fifty pounds, and to have been about five feet eleven inches in height, and of a most symmetrical, well-knit figure. His carriage was erect, his step rapid, his movements quick and energetic, and his bearing, though without a trace of haughtiness, peculiarly com manding. He had light hair, a fair skin, a ruddy com plexion, and large dark-blue eyes, singularly expressive of vivacity, good feeling, and fearlessness. They were"], [86, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 66 clear and mild, and yet stern and piercing\u2014 living flames, which, when stirred by excitement, actually blazed and danced with the emotion that moved him. They gleamed from under an arching eyebrow and a peculiarly white and lofty forehead, which, with a prominent nose, gave dignity to his face, despite the uncommon ease and geniality of his manner. He had strong, resolute jaws, and a mouth and chin of chiseled perfection. But the thing about him which first attracted attention was a strange blending of unconscious natural dignity with overflowing good feeling, combined with a sort of mag netic force that drew every one irresistibly to him. I question if, with but one or two exceptions, he ever had a personal enemy. He wore the ordinary hunting-shirt of the border, but it was scrupulously neat and well-fit ting. However, in any costume he would appear, what he was, a born gentleman ; for there was good blood in him. It is the custom of biographers to begin with a man's ancestors, for the purpose, I suppose, of deducting from his own value whatever may belong to his progenitors. And yet, however much their virtues may detract from our own merit, we are all proud if we have been so for tunate as to have had a reputable ancestry. We all have this weakness, and all like to trace, if we can, our genealogical tree down to its roots in the dark ages. The search may be rewarded by our finding some single ancestor of whom to be justly proud, hut very few of us discover a whole township, as was the case with the"], [87, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 67 young gentleman I am describing. He was never known to boast of his lineage, and probably few men could bet ter afford to dispense with an ancestry, yet he never wrote his name without putting on record that he was descended from the town of Xavier, in the French Pyre nees, and thus was of kin to the eminent Saint Francis of Xavier. This was the name of his ancestors, and they bore it till, being Huguenots, they had to flee from France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Then they settled in London, and the name became Anglicized into Sevier. The father of this young gentleman emigrated to America about 1740, and, marrying a lady of Baltimore, settled in Rockingham County, Virginia, where this son was born on the 23d of September, 1745. He was given as good an education as was common to the period, but throughout life he understood men better than he did books. His state papers indicate considerable reading, but the knowledge of men came to him by intuition. I have in my possession a letter written by him to James Madison, in 1804, which bears every mark of being penned by a man of cultivation. It is very clearly, tersely, and pointedly expressed, and written in a free, round, flow ing hand, and with a firm, rapid, open movement that entirely accords with his character. He early showed a predilection for military life, and so distinguished him self in the frequent conflicts with the Indians as to at tract the attention of Lord Dunmore, the last royal Gov ernor of Virginia, who made him, before he was twenty-"], [88, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 68 five, a captain in the Virginia line \u2014 the same rank held by his friend Evan Shelby, who had seen thirty years' service, and was twenty-five years his senior. It was in the same corps that Washington then held the rank of colonel. This young man had now come West to establish a new home for his wife and two young sons at what was then known as Keywood Settlement, farther to the north, and about six miles distant from the Shelbys. This was his first meeting with Robertson. I do not know that the two were then conscious \u2014 as were Jeremiah and Paul, and some other \"providential men\" \u2014 that they had been \"set apart from their mother's womb\" to do an impor tant work in the world ; but it is certain that they had no sooner looked into each other's eyes than they recog nized the fact that their work \u2014 whatever it was \u2014 would be done together. And so it was. From this time for ward, they stood shoulder to shoulder, amid toil and danger and hardship, through evil report and good re port, never losing faith or hope or trust, one in the other, till they went together to a higher life forty-three years afterward, amid such genuine sorrow as has sel dom afflicted a whole commonwealth. Others, like the Shelbys, were to act important parts ; but these two men were to be the great actors in the grand drama of civilization which was to be played beyond the Allegha nies ; and the greater of the two was this buoyant, free hearted young stranger from Virginia. For this was John Sevier, the Nolichucky Jack of"], [89, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 69 the border ; the Nemesis of old Oconostota ; the most renowned of Indian fighters ; the hero of thirty-five battles, every one of which was a victory ; the dashing leader, whose sword was to flash wherever the fight was hottest, and whose electric words, sounding in the desperate charge, were to set his men on fire, and transform the most timid among them into heroes. More than this, he was to be the Rear-Guard of the Revolution, and was to give a deadly wound to the anaconda the British would seek to coil about the re volted colonies ; and, when peace should at last return, it was he who would bring order out of chaos, fashion restless frontiersmen into law-abiding citizens, and, out of the most heterogeneous materials, erect a great com monwealth in the very heart of the wilderness. His exploits will read more like romance than history ; but they were the natural outgrowth of the man, who was altogether patriotic, magnanimous, heroic. Isaac Shelby was a born soldier, Robertson a born diplomatist ; but Sevier was soldier, diplomatist, and statesman all com bined ; and, moreover, he was the very incarnation of the spirit of the backwoods of that period. He gathered up and embodied in himself all the great qualities of that grand race of men who were the pioneers of West ern civilization. Every frontiersman saw in him those traits which, in his own best and highest moods, he felt within himself ; and in him he beheld them intensified, magnified, and in amazing activity ; and so Nolichucky Jack became his ideal and his natural leader, and he"], [90, "70 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. responded to his lightest word, just as the hand obeys the dictates of the will ; and hence it is no mere figure of speech to say that Sevier was the soul of the West- ern commonwealth. Had this man acted on a wider and more open stage, he would long ago have been reck- oned among the world's heroes. But nowadays we do not judge of an actor by the size of his theatre. Silent forces are those that disintegrate the mountains ; and at the distance of a century we are able to estimate men by what they accomplish. So estimating these men and their work, we see that, since the landing of the Pil- grims on Plymouth Rock, few more important events had yet occurred in the interest of civilization than the coming together of Sevier and Robertson in that log- cabin on the Watauga. What passed between the two men on this occasion I have no means of knowing, but it is certain that from this hour Sevier turned his back upon all prospects of wealth and distinction in the older settlements, and cast in his lot with that feeble community beyond the mountains. During this visit of Sevier and the Shelbys at Watauga, a trifling incident occurred which had im portant consequences. Gamblers and horse-thieves were the pests of the border. One of these gentry, a stout, savage fellow named Shoate, was then at Watauga ; and pretending that he had won a horse from a peaceable stranger in a wager, he took forcible possession of the animal in the public thoroughfare. The occurrence was"], [91, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 71 witnessed by the visitors ; and, naturally indignant, Sevier inquired if there was no law in the community. \"Never mind the rascal,\" said Evan Shelby; \"he'll soon take poplar \" \u2014 meaning that he would soon decamp by a \"dug-out\" made from that timber. He did ; and it is a comfort to know that he was hanged some seven years later for a similar outrage. The attempted theft of this horse led to the forma tion of a government for the new settlement. The set tlers were called together at the house of Robertson, and, being addressed by him and Sevier, proceeded at once to appoint a committee of thirteen to draft articles for the regulation of their public affairs. From these thir teen five were chosen to form a court, and act as judges, and by them \u2014 in the language of their Magna Charta \u2014 \"all things were to be settled\" ! Truly, a court of wider jurisdiction than any since organized in this country. This rude bench was composed of John Se vier, James and Charles Robertson, Zachariah Isbell, and John Carter, names, all of them, that afterward attained prominence in the history of Tennessee. Sevier was the youngest man among them. Speaking of this court in a memorial addressed to the Legislature of North Caro lina four years later, Sevier writes : \" Finding our selves on the frontiers, and being apprehensive that, for the want of a proper Legislature, we might become a shelter for such as endeavored to defraud their credi tors ; considering also the necessity of recording deeds, wills, and doing other public business ; we, by consent"], [92, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 72 of the people, formed a court for the purposes above mentioned, taking\u2014 by desire of our constituents \u2014 the Virginia laws for our guide, so near as the situa tion of affairs would admit. This was intended for ourselves, and was done by the consent of every indi vidual ; but, whenever we have had to deal with people out of our district, we have ruled them to bail, to abide by our determinations (which was, in fact, leaving the matter to reference) ; otherwise we dismissed their suit, lest we should in any way intrude on the Legisla tures of the colonies.\" This simple government, thus established, secured good order in the new community for several years fol lowing. It was organized in May, 1772, three years prior to the association formed for Kentucky \"under the great elm-tree outside the fort at Boonesboro \" ; and thus was the first really \"free and independent\" government in this country. Its originator, framer, and prime mover was John Sevier. Sevier at once built a house on the Watauga \u2014 a ram bling log structure of half a dozen rooms, all upon the ground-floor \u2014 and soon afterward he removed to it with his wife and two sons, James and John, who afterward fought by his side at King's Mountain. Accompany ing his family from Virginia came his father, Valen tine Sevier, now a man of about fifty-five, and his three younger sons, Valentine, Jr., Abraham, and Robert, of whom more will have to be said further on in this history."], [93, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 73 The coming of the Seviers gave a strong impetus to the growth of the new settlement. It had hitherto cir cled around Watauga, but, like a mountain-stream ob structed for a time by some casual obstacle, its gathering waters now burst their barriers, and overflowed the coun try in all directions \u2014 north to what is still known as Car ter's Station, south to the Nolichucky, and as far west as Chimney-Top Mountain. The more remote settlers were in an exposed position \u2014 almost alone, with beyond them a wide wilderness \u2014 hut they were in no fear from the Cherokees. The few who came to the settlements were friendly, and, after eating the settler's venison and smoking his tobacco, they would go away, grasping his hand, and saying : \" We are the white man's brothers ; the same house holds us, the same sky covers us. We are brothers.\" These were halcyon days : but once on a time Satan entered into paradise ; and one day, in the summer of 1772, one of his legitimate children, a Scotchman named Alexander Cameron, invaded this Eden on the Watauga. He was a subordinate of John Stuart, the British super intendent of Southern Indian affairs, and was then the resident agent among the Cherokees. He appeared at Watauga with a number of the Cherokee chieftains, and warned the settlers that they had encroached upon the Indian lands, and must move off or be removed by the British soldiery. However, he whispered to Sevier and Robertson \u2014 out of hearing of the more manly Cherokees \u2014 that for a reasonable consideration paid to him, the"], [94, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 74 representative of the British Government, they would be permitted to remain unmolested. Unfortunately, Cameron was right. The settlers were outside of the territory ceded to Kiug George by the Six Nations at Fort Stanwix. They had scarcely more knowledge of geography than Charles II, and were totally ignorant of the location of that line of 36\u00b0 30' which journeyed westward to the \" South Seas.\" It ran due west, cutting remorselessly through hills and mount ains, utterly regardless of the topography of the country, while they had followed the course of the streams and valleys, all of which trend to the southwest, never dream ing that they were straying beyond the limits of Virginia. Nearly all of them, even Robertson, were natives of that province, and they had the State pride which is to be ob served in Virginians even at this day ; and, moreover, they had no very devoted attachment for North Caro lina. This feeling explains much of the subsequent history of the Watauga settlers. They never felt any real affec tion for North Carolina, but always regarded her as a sort of step-mother, which, indeed, she proved to he, giv ing them no care in their infancy, and in their youth demanding a mother's rights, but fulfilling none of her duties. It was not Nature, but a chain and compass, that made these people North Carolinians. It was, therefore, with scarcely less chagrin that they now learned they had unwittingly expatriated themselves from the Old Dominion than that they were intruders"], [95, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 75 on the lands of the Cherokees \u2014 which they certainly were, for Colonel John Donelson, father to Mrs. Andrew Jackson, had been recently employed by Lord Dunmore to run the line of 36\u00b0 30', and had found it thirty miles to the northward. It was an awkward dilemma in which the settlers found themselves, but Sevier and Robertson met it man fully. They wasted no time in considering the overtures of the rascally British agent, but promptly declined his proposals. He stormed and threatened, but they turned their backs upon him, scorning to purchase se curity by bribery. Speaking in later years of these cor rupt overtures, Robertson said: \"This was the best thing ever done [to us] by the British Government. Never were threats so harmless and yet so powerful ; they were laughed to scorn. No man feared them out here, whatever they might have done in old Orange and in Wake. From a hatred to Tryon, and a contempt for the Indian agent, the people were easily conducted to the cherishing of both sentiments for the king, their royal master, as he was called : he was no longer ours.\" Some of the chieftains who were present expressed a reluctance to seeing the order of the British agent en forced, and all were willing the settlers should remain if they made no further encroachments ; but Sevier and Robertson were not content to occupy their homes by a title so precarious as the word of a few Cherokee warriors. By a proclamation dated October 7, 1763, George III had \"strictly enjoined and required that no private per-"], [96, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 76 sons do presume to purchase from the Indians any lands\" ; and that, \"if the Indians should be inclined to dispose of their lands, the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, at some general meeting or assembly of the Indians, to be held for that purpose by the gov ernor or commander-in-chief of our colony respectively.\" So the Watauga settlers could not buy their homes if they would, but the sapient king had not forbidden the leasing of lands from the Indians. This Sevier and Rob ertson decided to do, leaving to the future the acquiring of their homes in fee simple. Accordingly, they re quested the visiting chieftains to call together the head men of the tribe for a friendly council at the \"Watauga Old Fields.\" At a time appointed they came, six hundred half naked red-men, from the Tellico, the Tennessee, and even the mountains of Georgia ; and the whole white settle ment gathered together to meet them \u2014 in all, perhaps, one hundred men, with all the women and children in the near-by plantations. They were a picturesque group as they gathered under a great oak-tree that then stood on the southern bank of the Watauga, the whites in caps of tanned bear-skin, hunting-shirts, and cavalry-boots, and the Indians in buckskin hunting-shirts, leggins, and moccasins, their heads ornamented with coon's tails, or turkey or eagle's feathers, and some of them wearing a red sash around their waist and gilt epaulets upon their shoulders. For the head men of the tribe were among them : the gigantic Oconostota, the archimagus,"], [97, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 77 his bare breast seamed with scars, and his right leg dis abled by an awkward limp, which had given him among the white people \u2014 who had already lost their reverence for royalty \u2014 the name of Old Hop ; the silver-tongued Atta-Culla-Culla, the vice-king ; Savanuca, the prince of Echota, called the raven, for his keenness on the war scent, but to become the friend of peace and Robertson ; the Bloody Fellow, who had won his name by appropriate deeds ; the Bread-Slave Catcher, noted for his success in stealing negroes, who had taught the Indian women to make bread ; Noonday, a wide-awake young fellow ; John Watts, a promising young half-breed, who after ward achieved eminence in slaughtering white people ; and Old Tassell, a wise and reasonably just old man, subsequently archimagus, but destined to an ignominious end from the blind vengeance of a white stripling. These and others of the princes of the tribe gathered in a circle about Robertson and Sevier, and listened in grave silence to the proposals of the settlers. Robertson was the speaker ; for Sevier, who could talk as well as act, was young, and as yet merely \"the power behind the throne.\" They demanded a ten years' lease of all the lands on the Watauga and its tributaries, and they of fered in pay between five and six thousand dollars' worth of powder, lead, muskets, cotton-goods, and other arti cles of value to the Indians. The Cherokees were sharp at a bargain. Oconostota was satisfied with the consid eration, but he insisted upon cutting down the term of occupation to eight years. To this the whites assented ;"], [98, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 78 and then the treaty was drawn up and signed by all the head men of the nation. The price was then paid upon the spot \u2014 which is evidence that there was some avail able wealth among the settlers \u2014 and then the council broke up, and all, white men and red, engaged in a few days of friendly festivity. Dances, ball-plays, and foot races were improvised, in which the young men of both nations joined in good-natured rivalry, and it was hoped by the settlers that all possibility of hostile collis ion with their dangerous neighbors was removed to an indefinitely distant periqd. But this dream was soon rudely dispelled by a most unfortunate and inopportune occurrence. For the last day of the gathering it had been ar ranged that a great foot-race should take place between the younger braves and the young men of the settle ment, on the open ground along the southern bank of the river. The race was in full progress, and among the younger men all was mirth, hilarity, and good-natured emulation ; and even the older chieftains, catching the spirit of the occasion, had relaxed from their habitual gravity, and were cheering on the contestants, when sud denly, a musket-shot echoed over the grounds, and one of the young braves, the near kinsman of a chieftain, fell in his tracks lifeless. The report came from the woods near the race-ground, and pursuit failed to discover the assassin, but there could be no question that he was a white man. It was as if the shot had been fired into a magazine of"], [99, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 79 gunpowder. The Cherokees were there without arms, or there might have followed a bloody tragedy. As it was they silently gathered their goods together, and, with threatening gestures and faces presaging a bloody ven geance, rapidly stole away into the forest. It was subsequently discovered that the murderer was a young man named Crabtree, from the Wolf Hills (now Abingdon), Virginia, about fifty miles to the northeast. A brother of his had, not long before, been killed by the Shawnees, while engaged in exploring with Boone in Kentucky, and he had taken this inopportune time for his revenge. The Indians had left hastily, giving the whites no time for explanation or parley. Revenge \u2014 blood for blood \u2014 was the cardinal doctrine of their theology, and if something were not at once done to avert it, war, bloody and exterminating, would soon be upon the set tlers. And what could be done to avert it ? To flee the country would be to merely invite pursuit, and a hun dred miles of wilderness lay between them and any safe asylum. To remain was just as hazardous, for how could this handful of one hundred men sustain a conflict with three thousand infuriated savages ? Hastily the settlers gathered together in council, and then it was that Robertson volunteered, like Curtius, to ride into the breach \u2014 at the peril of his life to visit, and endeavor to pacify, the enraged Cherokees. It was a hundred and fifty miles through an unbroken forest, with death lurking behind every tree that grew by the way ;"], [100, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 80 but what, he said, was one life periled to save five hun dred ? Thus Robertson reasoned with his neighbors and friends ; and then, giving a parting kiss to his wife and child, he mounted his horse and rode off into the wilder ness. His route lay over the great Indian war-path, which led from the Valley of Virginia, in a southwesterly direc tion, to the Cherokee towns on the Little Tennessee, fol lowing pretty nearly the course now taken by the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad. Robertson, however, would turn aside from it at the junction of the Little Tennessee and Tellico, and visit the capital town, Echota, which I have already described, for here dwelt Oconostota, and here no doubt was now in session the great council, deliberating upon the fate of the white settlers. Along the route were traces of the hurried passage of the six hundred warriors only two days be fore ; but Robertson encountered no one till about noon on the second day, when he suddenly espied a white man, coming toward him heavily armed, and finely mounted. Each halted to reconnoitre the other for a few moments ; and then the stranger, uttering a pleasurable exclama tion, rode forward and grasped the hand of Robertson. He was the Indian trader, Isaac Thomas, whom I have mentioned as having been saved from the Tellico massa cre twelve years before. He was living at Echota, and had been sent by the Indian prophetess to Watauga, to warn the settlers of their danger. He knew Robertson, and told him of his errand ; and then the two concluded"], [101, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 81 that he had better turn about and escort Robertson to the Cherokee headquarters. This man, Isaac Thomas, on account of his services to the colonists at this time, and during the Revolution, is deserving of particular mention. He belonged to a class who were quite numerous upon the border, and of much importance in the early history of the country. Of ne cessity well acquainted with the various avenues leading to the Indian territory, and with the state of feeling among the savages, aud passing frequently between the Indian towns and the white settlements, they were often able to warn the whites of intended attacks, and to guide such hostile parties as invaded the Indian country. Though generally natives of North Carolina and Vir ginia, and known to be in sympathy with the colonists, they were, if prudent of speech and behavior, allowed to remain unmolested in the Indian towns, even when the warriors were shouting the war-song and brandishing the war-club on the eve of an intended attack on the settle ments. The reason of this was, that traffic with them was of great advantage to the Indian ; for, with the trap or rifle that he could get from the trader for a few skins, he could secure more game in a day than his bow and arrow, or rude \" dead-fall,\" would procure in a month of toil some hunting. The traders were, therefore, held in high esteem by the Indians ; and the Cherokees encour aged their living and even marrying among them. In fact, such alliances were deemed highly honorable, and were often sought by the daughters of distinguished chief-"], [102, "82 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. tains. Consequently, among the trader's other chattels would often be found a dusky mate, and half a dozen half-breed children ; and this, too, when he already had a wife and family somewhere in the settlements. This, however, was not the case with the trader we have now under notice. He was at this time a bachelor, though he died the father of a large and highly respect able family in Sevier County, Tennessee. He is said to have been a native of Virginia, and at this time about forty years of age. He is described as being over six feet in height, straight, strong-limbed, and wiry, and with a frame so steeled by twenty years of forest-life that he could endure almost any conceivable hardship. His feat ures are said to have been strongly marked, but regular, and to have worn an habitual expression of comic grav ity ; but on occasions his dark, deep-set eye had been known to light up with a look of unconquerable pluck and determination. He wore leggins, moccasins, and hunting-shirt of buckskin ; and from long exposure his face, neck, and hands had become tanned to the color of that material. His cool intrepidity had been shown on many occasions ; and this quality, together with his im mense strength, secured him great respect among the Cherokees, who, like all uncivilized people, set a high value on personal courage and mere physical prowess. It is related that, shortly before the Tellico massacre, he interfered in a feud between two Cherokee braves, who had drawn their tomahawks to hew each other in pieces. Having wrenched the weapons from their hands, both set"], [103, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 83 upon him, and he cooled their heated valor by lifting one after the other into the air and tossing him into the Tellico. One of those braves subsequently saved his life at the massacre near Fort Loudon. It was fortunate for Robertson that he encountered this man, for it secured him safe-conduct and access to the Cherokee chieftains at Echota. It was after dark when they entered the long avenue which was the only street in the town. They had been met by a young brave before reaching the precincts of the sacred city, and him they had dispatched to apprise Oconostota of the coming of Robertson. The answer was that the chief of the pale-faces was welcome, and Oconostota would give him audience on the morrow, when the great coun cil of the nation would be in session. Robertson repaired for the night to the house of Thomas \u2014 a one-and-a-half-story log-cabin, containing the trader's stock of traps, guns, powder and lead, hatch ets, looking-glasses, \"stroud,\" beads, scarlet cloth, and trinkets, articles of small cost, but highly prized by the red-man. The incidents of this heroic visit have been handed down from father to son among the descendants of Robertson ; but I shall venture to relate only so many of them as have been authenticated to me by two or three independent narrations. Tradition states that early on the following day the Indians from the near-by settlements began to pour into Echota, till, by an hour before noon, fully twelve hundred had gathered in the open space around the council-house. They were all in"], [104, "84 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. war-paint, and armed as if to go upon the war-path, and the lowering looks they cast upon Robertson, as he sat in the doorway of the trader's cabin, spoke plainly of a gen eral feeling of hostility to the white settlers. Evidently the war-spirit of the tribe was aroused, and it would be a miracle if Robertson averted the storm that was impend ing. As the sun touched the meridian, a young brave came to the house of Thomas, and announced that the great chief of the Cherokees was seated in the midst of his warriors, and would listen to the chief of the pale faces. With much ceremony Robertson was ushered into the council-house, where some sixty of the chieftains were collected. The larger number occupied the seats ranged around the circumference of the room, but about a dozen of the head men, or princes, of the tribe were seated in a circle on the ground in the center of the apartment. Among them were those Robertson had met at Watauga, and, as he was sorry to see, Dragging Canoe, head chief tain of the Chickamaugas, a turbulent and bloodthirsty warrior, who had absented himself from the council with the whites, and refused to be a party to the lease of land to the settlers. They all were arrayed in the high est style of Cherokee half -nakedness, and most of them were of such herculean proportions that, standing among them, Robertson seemed but as a pygmy among giants. Only one of them \u2014 Atta-Culla-Culla \u2014 was below six feet in height, and all were broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and of magnificent physical development. Their faces,"], [105, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 85 it is said, wore an expression of deep gravity and intense passion, but passion under the control of reason. They seemed bent upon action, but it would be action without haste, and with a deliberate survey of the consequences. Robertson was a man of the keenest sensibilities, but he had such wonderful control of his nerves as to have the best command of himself when in the greatest dan ger. He knew that his own life, as well as the present fate of Southwestern civilization, hung on what he said and did during this interview ; but, from what else we know of him, we can readily believe that he was now as cool and self-collected as if it had been he, and not the savage and treacherous Oconostota, who was holding the trembling scale whose upward or downward dip meant life or death to hundreds of helpless women and chil dren. It is said that the outer circle of chieftains rose as Robertson entered, and gathered about him with looks of as much wonderment as was ever seen on the face of a Cherokee. \"What,\" they no doubt asked themselves, \"is the secret of this man's unmoved serenity? He is but one, we twelve hundred, and by our law of retalia tion his life is forfeit. Whence, then, his look of singu lar power, as if he were a king, even greater than Ocon ostota?\" They had physical bravery, but they knew nothing of moral courage, which, when a man has a great purpose, lifts him above all thought of self, and makes his life no more to him than the bauble he wears upon his finger. There was silence, it is said, for a few moments, when"], [106, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 86 Oconostota rose and gave Robertson welcome to Echota. Then he bade him speak, for he and his warriors would listen. I regret that I can not give Robertson's exact words on this important occasion. He never recounted anything more than their substance, which was, that the young brave had been killed by one not belonging to the Watauga settlement. The murderer had fled, but would surely be apprehended and dealt with as his crime de served. Then he told the chieftains that the settlers had come into the country desiring to live in peace with all men, and more particularly with their neighbors the brave Cherokees. By all means in their power, he and his friends should endeavor always to cultivate with them relations of good-fellowship. The Indians listened at first with silent gravity, but, as Robertson went on, his evident sincerity awoke their kindly feelings, and they gave them vent in a few ex pressive \"Ughs!\" At the close the old archimagus rose, and, turning to the chieftains, said : \" What our white brother says is like the truth. What say my brothers ? Are not his words good ? \" The response was, \" They are good,\" and a general hand-shaking followed, during which all present urged Robertson to remain a few days and partake of their hospitality. Though anxious to return with the peace ful tidings, he considered it policy to remain. Thus he converted possible enemies into positive friends, and they were not alienated from him until the machinations of Captain John Stuart lured them into the army of the"], [107, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 87 civilized King of Great Britain on the outbreak of the Revolution. While Robertson was at Echota at this time, he made the personal acquaintance of the prophetess of whom I have spoken. This woman was the more than queen \u2014 she was the inspired sibyl \u2014 of the Cherokees. The power of Oconostota was absolute in time of war, but, in war or peace, it had to give way to that of the prophetess, when she spoke the will of the invisible guardian of the nation. Her influence was always exerted on the side of humanity, and to this day she is held in grateful remem brance by the descendants of the early settlers. An in stance of her kindly disposition toward the whites had occurred just prior to Robertson's visit to Echota. Two settlers, named Jeremiah Jack and William Rankin, had ventured down the Tellico with goods to exchange for corn, and had come into collision with a disorderly party of Cherokees. Their lives were about to be sacrificed, when the prophetess suddenly appeared among the In dians, commanding them to desist from their hostile intentions, for the white men were their brothers. The settlers went back, their canoe loaded with corn, and publishing everywhere the goodness of Nancy Ward, the \"Beloved Woman.\" She is supposed to have been at this time about thirty-five years of age. Her father had been an English officer named Ward, but her mother was of the blood royal, being a sister of the reigning vice-king, Atta- Culla-Culla. The accounts I have been able to glean of"], [108, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 88 her are scanty, but they are enough to show that she had a most kind heart, and a sense of justice keen enough to recognize the rights of the enemies of her nation. She must have possessed very strong traits of character to retain, as she did, almost autocratic control over the fierce and untamable Cherokees, when she was known to sympathize with and befriend the white settlers. Rob ertson felt the importance of securing her continued good-will, and he was accordingly glad of this opportu nity of an interview. He has left no further account of it, or of her, than that her lodge was furnished in a style of barbaric splendor, and that she was a woman \"queen ly and commanding.\" He now returned as speedily as he could to the settlers, who were waiting in anxious suspense the result of his mission. While Robertson was away, Sevier had not been idle. With the surprising energy characteristic of him, he had built a fort at Watauga, and gathered every white set tler into it, or safe within the range of its muskets. His force was not more than a hundred strong ; but, had Robertson been safely out of the savage hold, he would not have objected to a visit from Oconostota and his twelve hundred Ottari warriors. Sevier had no military training, except such as he had received under his friend Lord Dunmore, whose knowledge of the art of war was not considered very great ; but this rude and hastily constructed log fortress was a model of military archi tecture. It was located on Gap Creek, about half a mile north-"], [109, "ON THE OUTPOSTS. 89 east of the Watauga, and on a gentle knoll, from around which the trees, and even the stumps, were carefully cleared to prevent their sheltering a lurking enemy. The buildings have altogether crumbled away, but the spot where they stood is identified by a few graves and a large locust-tree, which remains to remind the visitor of the first conflict between civilization and savagery be yond the Alleghanies. The fort covered a parallelogram of about an acre, and was built of log-cabins placed at intervals along the four sides, the logs notched and fitted closely together, so that the walls were bullet-proof. The outer side of the cabins formed the exterior of the fort, the spaces between them being filled with palisades of heavy timber, eight feet long, sharpened at the upper ends, and set firmly in the ground. At each of the an gles was a block-house about twenty feet square and two stories high, the upper story projecting about two feet beyond the lower, and provided with port-holes, so as to command the sides of the buildings. The whole had two wide gateways constructed to open quickly, and thus admit of a sudden sally or the speedy rescue of out side fugitives. On one of these gateways was a lookout station, commanding a wide view of the surrounding country. The various buildings would comfortably house two hundred people, but in an emergency a much larger number could find shelter within the inclosure. This fort was the original aud model for a multitude of others that were subsequently built beyond the mountains. They were the forerunners of civilization \u2014"], [110, "90 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. the \"voice crying in the wilderness,\" and announcing the reign of peace which was to follow. Admirably adapted to their object, they would, when properly manned, easily repel any attack of fire-arms in the hands of such desultory warriors as the Indians. In the arith metic of the border, it soon came to be adopted as a rule that one white man behind a wall of logs was equal to twenty-five Indians in the open field, and subsequent events proved this to have been not a vain-glorious reck oning. These two events \u2014 Sevier's skill in putting the settle ment in a posture for defense, and Robertson's successful embassy to the Cherokees \u2014 elevated the two young men still higher in the estimation of the settlers ; and they never lost the leading positions they then attained \u2014 one as the soldier, the other as the diplomatist, of the nas cent commonwealth. In Robertson's absence, Sevier had embodied the settlers in a military company, of which they proposed that he should have command ; but he insisted upon Robertson being made captain and himself lieutenant, and this while Robertson had no military experience, and he himself was a captain by commission in the Virginia forces. But thus it ever was in the deal ings of these two men with each other. In honor, one always preferred the other."], [111, "CHAPTER IV. BEFORE THE STORM. Four years of unbroken peace with the Cherokees followed Robertson's visit to Oconostota. True to their pledges, the Indians remained friendly, though often suffering from the depredations of lawless white men from the seaboard settlements. These were reckless, desperate characters, fleeing from crime, who hoped to find freedom for unbridled license in a new community. Driven out by the Watauga settlers, they herded together for a time in the forest, subsisting by hunting, fishing, and preying upon the peaceable Cherokees, till at last, hunted down by them, they took final refuge among the Chickamaugas, the mongrel band of robbers and cut throats, who were headed by the turbulent and savage Dragging Canoe, of whom I shall have to speak here after. But the stream of immigration that now poured over the mountains was of a totally different character. It flowed at first around the settlements on the Watauga, and then spread along the Holston as far west as Carter's Valley, and on lands not included in the lease from the Indians. Among the new-comers were all classes \u2014 the"], [112, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 92 trader, the hunter, the land-speculator, and the farmer, but they were mostly of the latter class, who had come for permanent occupation. They were nearly all from Virginia, and of Scotch-Irish descent, generally poor, and threading the old Indian war-path or some narrow trace blazed by the hunters, with only a single pack horse, which carried all their worldly possessions. But they had strong arms and stout hearts, and added at once to the wealth and security of the young commu nity. They became, by the mere act of settlement, large land-owners, and their names are borne to-day by many of the leading families of the Southwest. Forts, mod eled after the one at Watauga, were built for the protec tion of the outlying settlers, and the colonists soon felt as secure as in their old homes in Virginia. In the fall of 1773 Boone again appeared in the Wa tauga settlement. He was on his way, with his wife and children and the families of four or five other pioneers, to make the first settlement in Kentucky. Hitherto no white woman had ever crossed the Cumberland Mount tains. He set out for Cumberland Gap late in Septem ber, and was soon joined by a party of forty well-armed hunters. The whole formed a caravan of eighty per sons, and, unconscious of danger, they were proceeding through a narrow defile when they were suddenly star tled by the terrific yells of a large body of Indians. The first fire killed six of the whites, among whom was a son of Boone, aged twenty. The whole body then fell back to the Watauga settlement, where Boone remained till"], [113, "BEFORE TEE STORM. 93 after the close of what is known as Lord Dunmore's War, which soon broke out along the borders of Virginia. The scene of hostilities was remote from the Watauga settlers, but it soon became known among them that Logan had succeeded in combining most of the northern tribes against the whites, and was then endeavoring to draw the Cherokees and Chickasaws into the coalition. This done, the tomahawk and scalping-knife would be brandished about their own dwellings. Weak as they were, they at once volunteered for the aid of their old friends in Virginia. John Sevier resumed his rank in the Virginia line, and took command of a company in Colonel Innes's regiment, and Evan Shelby raised fifty volunteers, and with them hastened to join General Lewis on the Ohio. In this company Isaac Shelby \u2014 who, we have seen, received his commission from the commandant of Fincastle County two years before \u2014 was lieutenant, and James Robertson and Valentine Sevier, Jr., were appointed sergeants. Thus it appears that, while Sevier had gone up one grade in military rank, Robertson had come down several grades ; but both \" promotions \" were voluntary. It mattered nothing to either of these men whether they served in the rank or file, fought on foot or on horseback. The thing to do was to strike the blow where and when it was needed. The Watauga company marched twenty -five days through a trackless wilderness, over mountain-gorges, and amid deep defiles, where not even an Indian trail had made a pathway, and at last joined the Virginia"], [114, "94 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. army as it lay encamped near the junction of the Kana wha and the Ohio. For the details of the battle fought there, I must refer to other histories. I only allude to it here because it was in this, the most fiercely contested Indian conflict ever fought on this continent, that the \"tall Watauga boys\" were apprenticed to the bloody trade it was theirs to follow for almost a generation. Here, too, the singular fortune attended them which made them thrice again the deciders of a great conflict. In the morning they saved the army from surprise, and in the evening they turned the tide to victory. At four o'clock, on the morning of October 10, 1774, one thousand Virginians lay sleeping under the trees at the mouth of the Kanawha, dreaming of their homes, and their wives and children \u2014 dreaming, when not two miles away fifteen hundred Shawnees, Delawares, and Mingoes, led by the heroic Cornstalk and the infuriated Logan, were stealing down upon them. It is the hour when men sleep the soundest ; but just then James Robertson and Valentine Sevier awoke, and, taking their guns, went out to shoot some deer for the breakfast of their company. They had not proceeded far before they heard the stealthy glide of some large body through the forest. They halt and listen ; and soon, not ten paces away, they see through the darkness the creep ing forms of the on-coming enemy. They discharge their pieces at the advancing horde ; then turn and make all speed to alarm the sleeping army. The sudden discharge of the two rifles brought the Indians to a"], [115, "BEFORE THE STORM. 95 halt, and gave time for the Virginians to form in readiness to receive them. All day the battle raged, at times like the howling of a tempest, and all day the victory wavered, now to this side and now to that, till the dead were piled in heaps, and more than one fifth of both armies had fallen. But, still the voice of Cornstalk was heard above the din, bidding his warriors \"Be strong! Press forward ! \" Colonel Lewis had fallen early in the fight, leaving his regiment to the command of Evan Shelby ; and now, just as darkness is coming on, with the battle yet undecided, Isaac Shelby, who is left in command of the Watauga company, sees that, by creep ing along the bank of the Kanawha, he can, in the shelter of the underbrush, gain the rear of the enemy. Taking two other companies with him, he does this, and then pours a sudden and destructive volley upon the savages. Taken thus between two fires, the Indians are panic-stricken and floe in all directions. In vain Cornstalk and Logan attempt to rally them. They scatter, like October leaves before the wind, to their far homes on the Scioto. Peace soon follows ; and then Boone is at liberty to pursue his darling project of set tling Kentucky. But for the intrigues of John Stuart, and the barba rous policy adopted by the British Cabinet of midnight massacre among men and women of their own kindred, this victory would have effectually cowed the savages, and brought permanent peace to the border. As it was,"], [116, "96 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. the fact that a thousand frontiersmen could be got together at the tap of a drum, to fight all day as they fought at Point Pleasant, seemed to be a lesson lost upon both the British and the Indians. Peace being concluded, the Watauga fifty returned to their homes, racked their rifles and powder-horns over their doorways, and resumed the axe and the plow with which they were subduing the wilderness. Sevier remained behind in Virginia, detained by the illness of his wife, who soon after died, leaving him, at the age of twenty-nine, a widower with two manly boys of nine and eleven years. He had been married before he was seventeen. In the mean time, in his enforced idleness, Boone had been dreaming of Kentucky, and Colonel Richard Henderson had continued to indulge in his splendid vision of a great commonwealth beyond the Cumber land. The Six Nations had relinquished their title to this territory to his Majesty King George ; but the Cherokees still claimed the whole of Kentucky as a hunting-ground. Their title must he extinguished be fore any peaceable occupation could be had of the coun try. Robertson had been much among them during the more than four years he had been their neighbor ; had acquired their language, and won the friendship of some of their principal chieftains ; and he now re ported to Boone that the nation had become fond of gay clothing, ear and nose jewels, and tinkling orna ments, and if those were offered them in sufficient"], [117, "BEFORE THE STORM. 97 quantity the Indians would no doubt sell their north ern hunting-grounds. Upon this hint, Boone conferred with Colonel Henderson ; and then with one or two companions he went among the Cherokees. \"None of you,\" he said to them, \"have towns in that wilderness. Other Indian hunters kill the game there \u2014 probably more of it than you do. We will pay you for your claim. Come to the Sycamore Shoals [Watauga], and have a talk with your friends.\" On the 17th of March, 1775, the Indians came, twelve hundred warriors ; and again all the settlers \u2014 now num bering two hundred and fifty men, besides women and children \u2014 gathered together to meet them, till at least two thousand people were collected around the fort at Watauga. Among the Indians were Oconostota, Atta- Culla-Culla, and the principal chieftains of the tribe ; and among the whites were Sevier, Robertson, Boone, Henderson, and some of his associates in the land com pany. A great pow-wow ensued, with feasting and danc ing, and other \"manly exercises,\" and during it the trinkets which had been laboriously brought from over the mountains on pack-horses were temptingly displayed before the simple savages. Their eyes were dazzled by the gilded show, and their heads turned by the fire-water of Henderson, till they were eager to sell their birthright for this mess of pottage. But not so Oconostota. He was fond of the whisky of the white man, but in the dregs of his cup he beheld a vision of the future of his red race, aud, in the great council which followed, he B"], [118, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 98 lifted up his voice in what \u2014 read now at the distance of a century \u2014 we see was a prophecy. He began by reminding the Indians of the time, which he could remember, when his nation could count sixty populous towns, and muster six thousand invincible warriors ; and then he spoke of the gradual encroachments of the white man, how step by step he had advanced upon their hunting-grounds, and how the red-man had with ered and vanished away before him. He told how the white man's insatiable greed for land had robbed them of the homes and groves of their ancestors, and how whole nations had melted away in his presence, like snow before the sun, leaving scarcely their names behind, except as recorded in the boastful annals of their enemies and de stroyers. He had once hoped the white man would not penetrate beyond the mountains, so far was it from the ocean on which he traded and kept up his connections with his race in Europe. But this hope had now van ished. He had crossed the Alleghanies and settled upon the Cherokee lands, and now he wanted his encroachment sanctioned by the solemnity of a treaty. Grant him that, and the same encroaching spirit would lead him upon other land of the Cherokees. He would call for new ces sions, till at last the country which held their wigwams, and had, time out of mind, been the home of their ances tors, would be wrested from them, and the weak remnant of a once great nation would be driven into the far West ern wilderness, there to dwell for but a short space before they again beheld the advancing banners of the same"], [119, "BEFORE THE STORM. 99 greedy host, and were driven westward to the great ocean beyond the setting sun, where, there being no land left except for their graves, the white man would pro claim the total extinction of their race. Oconostota closed his impassioned address by urging the Cherokees to run all risks and incur all consequences rather than submit to any further encroachments of the white race. In a grand council of the Indians all have a right to speak, and it is what a man says, and not the man who says it, that gives weight to the words which are uttered. Oconostota was a great and wise chieftain, but he had no sooner taken his seat than a young warrior arose, whose eyes had been dazzled by the white man's trinkets. He reminded the Indians that their hereditary enemies, the Shawnees, the Mingoes, the Senecas, and the Dela wares, often came to their northern hunting-grounds, and if they met there a Cherokee they left his bones to be buried in the winter's snow. The white man knew how to meet them, and if he settled Kentucky he would be a wall between the Cherokees and their northern ene- mies. His words, and the eloquence of Henderson's trink ets, prevailed over the appeal of Oconostota, and the old archimagus was obliged to assent to the desired cession, and to sign the treaty which followed. Then it appearing, writes Sevier, \"that persons of distinction were actually making purchases forever \u2014 gen tlemen of the law, supposed to be better judges of the"], [120, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 100 Constitution than we were\u2014 thus yielding a precedent ; and considering the bad consequences which would at tend the reversion being purchased out of our hands, we next proceeded to make a purchase of the lands, reserv ing those in our possession in sufficient tracts for our own use, and resolving to dispose of the remainder for the good of the community.\" This treaty was signed two days subsequent to the Henderson purchase; and thus the settlers, \"for two thousand pounds sterling, paid in goods,\" became pos sessed of their homes in fee simple. When the two treaties had been executed, Oconostota said to Boone, \" Young man, we have sold you a fine territory ; but I fear you will have some difficulty in getting it settled \" \u2014 which remark shows that the wily old chieftain, though for the moment overborne by the greed of his people for gewgaws, was already meditating the dark and treacher ous policy which made him for twenty years the most powerful enemy of Western civilization. Even when in firm and almost bedridden, his unconquerable spirit con tinued to animate the whole Cherokee nation ; and he did not die till his old eyes had beheld his prophecy fulfilled in the natural result of his own deeds \u2014 his na tion crushed aud trodden underfoot by John Sevier, and about to be driven to a far-distant wilderness beyond the Mississippi. When the execution of the Watauga treaties became known in North Carolina, the royal governor of that province issued a proclamation declaring them illegal,"], [121, "BEFORE THE STORM. 101 and without authority from his government. This soon reached the ears of the Cherokees, and helped Oconostota to bring over the nation to the view that the treaties were of no binding force whatever. This was the kind of pro tection which the British gave to the colonists. In but little more than a month after the signing of these treaties, the battles of Lexington and Concord were fought; and the shot which was soon to be \"heard around the world\" echoed in that secluded hamlet on the Watauga. As it sounded through those old woods, every backwoodsman sprang to his feet, grasped his rifle, and asked to be enrolled for the succor of his country men on the seaboard. In that whole mountain-region there was not a single Tory. Every man among them was a patriot, burning to fight, and, if need be, to die for his country. And their patriotism was not stimu lated by British oppression. They were beyond the reach of the \"red-coated minions\" of King George. No tax-gatherer had ever been among them. They paid no tea nor stamp duty, for they drank corn-whisky flavored with spring-water, and sealed their legal docu ments with melted rosin and a hot poker. As Sevier expressed it, it was their love for \"the glorious cause of liberty\" which led them to enroll, \"at the expense and risk of their private fortunes,\" a fine body of riflemen, to act on the seaboard in defense of the common cause. Up to this time, for more than five years, they had stood alone, giving to, and not receiving aid from, the seaboard settlements \u2014 and this while surrounded by a"], [122, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 102 dense host of savages. And now what do they do ? The worthy annalist of Tennessee, Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey, searching some time ago among the archives of North Carolina, discovered, \" in an old bundle of papers, lying on an upper shelf, almost out of reach, and probably not seen before for seventy-five years,\" a document in the handwriting of John Sevier, which answers the question. They proceed to address a memorial to the patriot (rebel) Legislature of North Carolina, asking to be \"annexed\" to that colony, that they may aid in the \"present un happy contest,\" and bear their \"full proportion\" of the Continental expenses. This memorial was signed by one hundred and fourteen \u2014 every man then present at the Watauga station \u2014 and all but two of them were able to affix their names in good, legible English. Their petition was granted, and the whole of what is now Tennessee was organized into what was called, in honor of the newly made commander of the American armies, the \" Washington District,\" with power to elect delegates to a Constitutional Convention, which was soon to assemble at Halifax, North Carolina, to form a State Constitution. John Sevier, Charles Robertson, and John Carter were elected delegates to this convention, and they attended, leaving James Robertson to manage affairs at home. In the Declaration of Rights which was adopted by this Congress is this clause, introduced by Sevier into the article defining the limits of the State : \" That it shall not be so construed as to prevent the establishment of one or more governments westward of this State, by con-"], [123, "BEFORE THE STORM. 103 sent of the Legislature\" ; thus showing that he had al ready in mind the establishment of a separate common wealth beyond the Alleghanies. The riflemen who had been embodied were not dis patched to the seaboard, because a hostile feeling was soon manifested among the Cherokees, and it became apparent that every able-bodied man among them would speedily be needed for the defense of their own fire sides. The policy of employing the scalping-knife of the Indian as the ally of England in her conflict with her revolted colonies was denounced in Parliament by the great Lord Chatham, hut it was inaugurated by the British Cabinet at the very beginning of the struggle, and was persisted in even up to the War of 1812. The ignominy of thus arraying savagery against civilization belongs, by way of eminence, to John Stuart, British superintendent of Southern Indian affairs, who himself, as we have seen, so narrowly escaped a savage death at the hands of the infuriated Oconostota. He first con ceived and instigated the barbarous policy, and, as early as June 12, 1775, he concerted with General Gage, then commander-in-chief of the British armies in America, a gigantic scheme for the banding together of all the West ern tribes in a combined attack on the rear of the colo nies, while the British forces should make a simultaneous descent on the Southern seaboard. Gage laid the plan before the British Cabinet, and, early in 1776, Captain Stuart received instructions from the English War De-"], [124, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 104 partment to carry it into execution. The details of it may be gathered from the following words of a British historian : * \" British agents were employed in engaging the In dians to make a diversion and to enter the Southern col onies on their back and defenseless parts. Accustomed to their disposition and habits of mind, the agents found but little difficulty in bringing them over to their purpose by presents and hopes of spoil and plunder. A large body of men was to be sent to West Florida, in order to penetrate through the territory of the Creeks, Chicka saws, and Cherokees. The warriors of these nations were to join the body, and the Carolinas and Virginia were immediately to be invaded. At the same time, the attention of the colonies was to be diverted by another formidable naval and military force, which was to make an impression on the sea-coast. But this undertaking was not to depend solely on the British army and Indi ans. It was intended to engage the assistance of such of the white inhabitants of the back settlements as were known to be well affected to the British cause. Circular letters were accordingly sent to those persons by Mr. Stuart, requiring not only the well- affected, but also those who wished to preserve their property from the miseries of a civil war, to repair to the royal standard as soon as it should be erected in the Cherokee country, with all their horses, cattle, and provisions, for which they should be liberally paid.\" * C. Stcdman, \" History of the American War,\" vol. i."], [125, "BEFORE THE STORM. 105 Thus the colonists were to be encircled by a cordon of fire ; every man's home was to be enveloped in flames, and his worst foes were to be those of his own house hold. The plan was studiously concealed at the time, but was subsequently brought to light in the pages of an English historian, who was himself an actor in the events. Twice the British attempted to put it into execution, and twice they failed, by the help of Al mighty God and that handful of backwoodsmen on the banks of the Watauga. They were only a handful, and thus have almost escaped the notice of historians, but they bore the brunt of the savage onset, and, while it was yet burning, extinguished the brand that was in tended to consume the colonies."], [126, "CHAPTER V. THE FIRST STRUGGLE. The British fleet under Sir Peter Parker was to capt ure Charleston, and to land a large army under Sir Henry Clinton. This force was to overrun the Carolinas and Virginia, while a strong body of Creeks and Chero kees, led by Oconostota, Dragging Canoe, and other chieftains, should devastate the western border. Thus the Southern colonies would be enveloped and crushed in the folds of an anaconda. But of this bloody plan the colonists were as yet in total ignorance. Alexander Cameron was still the British agent, sub ordinate to Stuart, living among the Cherokees. He had a personal animosity against Sevier and Robertson, and the kind of loyalty which did not scruple to com mit midnight massacre in the interest of his sovereign. Early in 1775 the settlers were apprized by the Indian trader, Isaac Thomas, that Cameron was at Echota, en deavoring to incite the Cherokees to hostilities by the hopes of spoil and plunder, and the recovery of the hunt ing-grounds out of which, he said, they had been de frauded by the Watauga treaty. The Indians could not at first understand how men of the same race and Ian-"], [127, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 107 guage could be at war with one another. It had never been so known in Indian tradition. But an event soon occurred which showed that the virus implanted by the crafty Scotchman had begun to spread among the young er braves, and might soon break out over the whole na tion. A trader named Andrew Greer, whose home was at Watauga, had been on a trading visit to Echota. He had disposed of his wares, and was about to return with the furs he had received in exchange, when he thought he perceived signs of hostile feeling among some of the young warriors. Fearing an ambuscade on his way home, he left the usual route over the great war-path, and took a less frequented trail along the Nolichucky. Two other traders, named Boyd and Dagget, who left Echota on the following day, pursued the usual route, and were waylaid and murdered at a small stream, which has ever since borne the name of Boyd's Creek. In a few days their bodies were di scovered, only half -concealed in the shallow water ; and, as the tidings flew from ham let to hamlet, universal alarm and indignation were ex cited throughout the white settlements. The settlers had been so long at peace with the Cherokees that they had been lulled into a false security ; but they knew that the savage, having once tasted blood, would have his appetite whetted by what it fed on ; and they must now prepare for a desperate struggle with an enemy of twenty times their number. The fort at Watauga was at once put in a condition for efficient de-"], [128, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 108 fense ; smaller forts were erected in the center of every scattered settlement, and a larger one was built on the frontier, near the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Holston. This last was called Fort Patrick Henry, in honor of the patriot Governor of Virginia ; the one on the Watauga received the name of Fort Lee. Every able-bodied male, sixteen years of age and over, was now enrolled, placed under competent officers, and drilled for the struggle that seemed to be impending. All were unerring marksmen, and all were armed with the famous Deckard rifle, a gun with a stock three to four feet long, and a barrel of about thirty inches, spiral grooved, and of remarkable precision for a long shot. But the winter wore away without any further act of hostility on the part of the Cherokees. Oconostota, who was deeper in the counsels of Stuart than even Cameron, knew that the time for action had not yet arrived. He therefore held back ; and he was able to restrain the younger warriors who thirsted for the conflict, because of the excitement and glory they could find only in war. Nancy Ward was in the secrets of the Cherokee leaders, and every word uttered in their councils she fully re ported to Isaac Thomas, by whom intelligence was con stantly conveyed by trusty messengers to Sevier and Rob ertson. Thus things went on till the spring of 1776, when John Stuart himself appeared among the Cherokees, bound on a personal mission to the Northern tribes, with several boat-loads of arms and ammunition, to prepare"], [129, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 109 them for the coming contest. He and Oconostota kept their own counsel, but Nancy Ward reported that his coming boded an early attack upon the settlements. At last, on the 30th of May, 1776, she said to Thomas : \" Send my white brothers word to be ready ; for the bolt will fall very soon, and at midnight. Let them be vigi lant and well prepared.\" Sevier at once sent to Colonel Preston, commandant of the Virginia border, for an additional supply of pow der and lead. Two hundred pounds of lead and half as much powder were all that could be spared, but this was at once distributed \u2014 the greater part being sent to Fort Patrick Henry, the most exposed position on the front ier. The settlement was now under the government of North Carolina, but no military officer had yet been placed in command of the district. The entire force of the settlers was two hundred and ten men, forty of whom were at Fort Lee, under Sevier and Robertson ; the rest at and near Fort Patrick Henry, under no less than six militia captains, no one of whom was bound to obey the order of any of the others. This many-headed author ity would, doubtless, have wrought disaster to the loose jointed force, had there not been with it, as a volunteer private, the young man of twenty-five who had turned the tide at Point Pleasant. Here again was he to show that he \" deserved well of his country.\" Now, from the 30th of May, 1776, until the 11th of July following, the settlers sleep with their rifles in their hands, expecting every night to hear the war-whoop of"], [130, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 110 the Cherokees, and every day to receive some messenger from Nancy Ward, who shall announce that the warriors are on the march to the settlements. At last messengers came \u2014 four at once, as we may see by the following let ter from Sevier to the Virginia Committee of Safety : \"Fort Lee, July 11, 1776. \" Dear Gentlemen : Isaac Thomas, William Fal ling, Jarot Williams, and one more, have this moment come in by making their escape from the Indians, and say six hundred Indians and whites were to start for this fort, and intend to drive the country up to New River before they return. John Sevier.\" He says nothing of the feeble fort, or its slender garrison of forty men, about to be outnumbered fifteen to one. He asks for no re-enforcements ; and he shows no fear in face of the great peril. The letter is merely to warn his Virginia friends that the country is to be driven as far up as New River. It is altogether char acteristic of the man, absolutely fearless, and thinking always, in however great a strait, first of others and last of himself. The details of the information brought by Thomas to Sevier and Robertson showed how truthfully Nancy Ward had previously reported the secret designs of the Cherokees. The whole nation was about to go upon the war-path. With the Creeks, they were to make a de scent upon Georgia ; and with the Shawnees, Mingoes,"], [131, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 111 and Delawares, upon the exposed parts of Virginia ; while seven hundred chosen Ottari warriors were to fall upon the settlers on the Watauga, Holston, and Noli chucky. This .last force was to be divided into two bands of three hundred and fifty men each, one of which, under Oconostota, was to attack the fort at Watauga, the other, under Dragging Canoe, to capture Fort Patrick Henry, which they supposed to be only weakly defended. But the two bodies were to act to gether \u2014 one supporting the other in case the settlers made a stouter defense than was anticipated. The preparations for the march Thomas had himself seen ; its objects, and the points to be attacked, he had learned from Nancy Ward, who had come to his cabin at midnight on the 7th of July, and urged his imme diate departure for the settlements. He had delayed setting out till the following night, in order to give his information to his friends William Falling, Jarot and Isaac Williams, who he proposed should set out at the same time, but by different routes, so that, in case one or more of them should be waylaid and killed, there might be a chance for at least one to get through to the settlements. However, at the last moment, the British agent, Cameron, had himself disclosed the ]iurpose of the expedition to Falling and the two brothers Wil liams, and detailed them, with a Captain Guest, to go along with the Indians as far as the Nolichucky. There they were to scatter among the settlements, and warn any \"king's man\" to join the Indians, or to"], [132, "112 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. wear a certain badge by which he would be known and protected in any attack from the savages. They all had set out with the Indians ; but had escaped from them during the night of the 8th, and arrived in safety at Watauga. Falling was sent with Sevier's letter into Virginia ; the two brothers Williams were dispatched to give the alarm at Fort Patrick Henry ; but Thomas remained to fight it out with the little garrison at Watauga. Then, in those July days, when the bells throughout the country were pealing out the newly declared birth of a nation, those forty resolute men prime afresh their rifles, and wait, with bated breath, the onset of the savage horde that the British have let loose for the butchery of the two hundred women and children who crouch there under their protection. But the first attack was not at Watauga. The garri son at Fort Patrick Henry had two days' prior tidings from the Cherokees. Only a few men were stationed at the fort, the rest being scattered among the outlying stations, but all were within easy supporting distance. The women and children had been gathered into the fort at Watauga, or hastily sent on pack-horses over the line into Virginia near the head of the Holston, to what was known as the Backwater settlements. Scouts were kept out in all directions ; and on the morning of July 19th they came in, reporting a large body of Indians, only twenty miles away, and marching directly upon the garrison. Runners were sent out at once to bring in"], [133, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 113 the scattered forces, and by nightfall one hundred and seventy men had gathered at the fort, ready to meet the enemy. Then a council was held by the six militia captains to decide upon the best plan of action. The most were in favor of awaiting the attack of the savages behind the walls of the fort ; but two of them \u2014 James Shelby (a younger brother of Isaac), and William Cocke, afterward honorably conspicuous in the history of Tennessee \u2014 pro posed the bolder course of encountering the enemy in the open field. If they did not do this, there would be danger that the Indians, passing them on the flank, would fall on and massacre the defenseless women and children who had been sent to the rear. It was a step of extreme boldness \u2014 for the little force expected to encounter the entire body of seven hundred Cherokees \u2014 but it was agreed to unanimously. Early on the following morning the little army, with flankers and an advance guard of twelve, marched out to meet the enemy. They had not gone far before the men in advance came upon about twenty of the Indians, who at once turned and fled precipitately. The advance guard pursued, and the main body fol lowed for some distance, but without coming upon any considerable body of the enemy. Night now was soon coming on ; and they were in a country broken into defiles, and overgrown with underbrush, and thus favor able to an Indian ambuscade. Fearing this, the offi cers called a halt ; and in another council decided to"], [134, "114 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. retrace their steps to the fort, and wait for the morn ing. It was difficult to restrain the men from an ad vance, but the return march was begun, and had pro ceeded about a mile, when suddenly iu their rear ap peared the whole force of the enemy. Evidently the twenty Indians had been a decoy to lead the whites into an ambuscade ; and, seeing it had failed, the sav ages had come on to fight in the open field. The whites wheeled about, and were forming into line, when the whole body of Indians rushed furiously upon them, not waiting to reload their rifles, but brand ishing their scalping-knives and tomahawks, and shout ing : \" The Unakas are running ! Come on, and scalp them ! \" Simultaneously they attacked the center and left flank of the whites ; and then was seen the hazard of going into battle with a many-headed commander. For a moment all was confusion, and the companies were being broken in attempting to form in the face of the impetuous attack, when Isaac Shelby \u2014 having no command, and present only as a volunteer \u2014 rushed to the front, and ordered each company a few steps to the rear, to reform, while he and four others should meet the onset of the savages. Recognizing in the young volunteer their natural leader, the men obeyed his command instantly ; and during the few moments occupied in forming into line he and Lieutenants William Moore, Robert Edmiston, and John Morrison, and private John Findley, the old companion of Boone, bore the brunt of the assault. In"], [135, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 115 hand-to-hand conflict Edmiston slew three or four of the Indians, Morrison as many more, Findley was bad ly wounded, and then Moore became engaged in a des perate struggle with a herculean chieftain, and, as if by general consent, the Indians paused to await its issue. This delay, no doubt, saved much loss of life among the one hundred aud seventy. It lasted for some min utes, but ended by Moore's sinking his tomahawk into the brain of the Indian. Meanwhile the whites had formed into line, and poured a destructive volley in among the Cherokees, who, now that the single-handed conflict was over, made a rapid movement upon the five men who so bravely stood as a forlorn hope during those few perilous moments. The five fell back into the line, but Edmiston, being iu the center, still bore the weight of a furious assault. He was a strict Scotch Presbyterian, but is said to have been called to account for some profane language used on this occasion. Twenty-six savages were dead upon the ground, and Dragging Canoe himself was badly wounded, before they gave up the contest. Then they slowly withdrew, carrying off their wounded. In all, forty of them were killed. Of the whites, none were killed, and only four seriously disabled. The conflict over, Shelby sent off a horseman with the tidings to Watauga. \"A great day's work in the woods ! \" was Sevier's exultant remark, when the messen ger told him of the astonishing victory. Meanwhile Oconostota and his three hundred and"], [136, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 116 fifty warriors had followed the trail along the Noli chucky, and, on the morning of the 20th, had come upon the house of William Bean, the hospitable enter tainer of Robertson on his first visit to Watauga. The small fort near by had been abandoned, and all the set tlers, men, women, and children, had fled for protection to Fort Lee \u2014 all except the good Mrs. Bean, who, having many friends among the Indians, was confident she would not be molested. In this she was mistaken. The Indians took her captive, and removed her to their camp on the Nolichucky. There she was brought before Ocon ostota, who questioned her as to the strength of the whites and the disposition of their forces. She gave him misleading replies, with which he appeared satisfied ; but another chieftain pointed his rifle at her as if to fire, when the old king threw up the barrel, and assured Mrs. Bean that she should not be killed, but taken to their towns to teach the Indian women how to manage a dairy. The garrison at the fort knew that Oconostota was near by on the Nolichucky, but he had deferred the attack so long that they concluded the wary old chief tain had decided to wait till he could be re-enforced by Dragging Canoe after the capture of Fort Patrick Henry. News had reached them of Shelby's victory, and, think ing it would be some days before the broken Cherokees could rally to the support of Oconostota, they were in no apprehension of sudden danger. Hence, they went about their vocations much as usual, and so it was that a"], [137, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 117 number of women ventured outside the fort in the early morning of July 21st. Among them was one who was afterward to occupy for many years the position of the first lady in Tennessee. Her name was Catherine Sher rill, and she was the daughter of one of the first settlers. I know of no portrait of her in existence, but tradition describes her as being now about twenty years old, tall, straight as an arrow, and lithe as a hickory sapling. She had, it is said, regular features, dark eyes, flexible nos trils, a neck like a swan, a clear, transparent skin, and a wealth of dark-brown hair that was in striking contrast with the whiteness of her complexion. A free life in the woods had made her as agile as a deer, and she had been known to place her hand upon a six-barred fence, and, encumbered by her womanly attire, to clear it at a single bound. Now her agility was to do her essential service. While, unconscious of danger, she and some other women were engaged in domestic pursuits at a little dis tance from the fort, suddenly the war-whoop echoed through the woods, and a band of yelling savages rushed out upon them. Quick as thought the women spring to their feet and dart toward the gate of the fort ; but the savages are close upon them in a neck-and-neck race, and Catherine, more remote than the rest, is cut off from the entrance. Sevier sees her danger, and, with about a dozen others, opens the gate and is rushing out to her rescue, in the face of two or three hundred savages, when Robertson holds him back, saying, \" You can not"], [138, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 118 help her, and going out will destroy the whole of us.\" Then they cover her with their rifles, and Sevier sends at least one of her pursuers to the happy hunting grounds. At a glance Kate takes in the situation. She can have no help from her friends, and the tomahawk and scalping-knife are close behind her. The savages are between her and the gate of the fort, but quickly she turns, and, fleeter than the deer, makes for a point in the stockade at some distance from the entrance. The palisades are eight feet high, but with one bound she reaches the top, then clambers over, and falls into the arms of Sevier, who is waiting to receive her. Then, for the first time, he calls her his \"Bonnie Kate,\" his \"brave girl for a foot-race.\" The other women have entered at the gate in safety. The baffled savages now opened fire, and for a full hour it rains bullets upon the little inclosure. But the missiles fall harmless ; not a man is wounded. Driven by the light charges the Indians use, the bullets merely bound from the thick logs, and do no kind of damage. But it was not so with the fire of the besieged. The order was, \"Wait till you are sure of your man \u2014 don't waste your powder\" ; and so every one of those forty rifles did terrible execution. For twenty days the Indians hung about the fort, but not a man who kept within the walls was so much as wounded. But it was not so with a man and a boy who, made bold by a few days' silence of the Indians, vent-"], [139, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 119 ured to go outside and down to the river. The man was scalped on the spot ; the boy was reserved for a worse fate, when the fight was over, in one of the In dian villages. He was a younger brother of Lieutenant Moore, who fought so bravely at Fort Patrick Henry. At the end of twenty days Oconostota heard of re-en forcements being on the way from Virginia for the relief of the garrison, and, baffled and dispirited, he fell back to his home on the Tellico. He had lost about sixty killed, and probably had a larger number wounded, and he had inflicted next to no damage upon the white set tlers. Instead of spoil and glory, he had given only death and disgrace to his warriors ; and now they clamor for leave to hunt other game than such as wields a Deck ard rifle \u2014 all but Dragging Canoe and his band of Chick amauga bandits. This chieftain's wound had made him furious. He was enraged beyond expression, and thirst ing for vengeance. Only two prisoners were in his pow er, but on them he determined to wreak the extremest tortures. Young Moore was taken to the village of his captor, high up in the mountains, and there burned at a stake ; and a like fate was determined for Mrs. Bean, the kindly woman from whose hospitable door no one \u2014 white man or red \u2014 ever went away unwelcome. Oconostota would have spared her life, but Dragging Canoe insisted that she should be offered a sacrifice to the manes of his fallen warriors ; and the opposition of even the archimagus was powerless."], [140, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 120 Mrs. Bean was taken to the summit of one of the ancient burial-mounds, which are still so numerous along the banks of the Tellico. She is here tied to a stake, the fagots are heaped about her, and fire is about to be set to them, when suddenly Nancy Ward appears among the throng of revengeful savages and orders a stay of the execution. Dragging Canoe is a powerful chieftain, but he is not powerful enough to combat the will of this woman. Mrs. Bean . is not only liberated \u2014 with an honorable escort she is sent back to her husband. The body of Indians under Dragging Canoe, which was defeated near Fort Patrick Henry, scattered at once into the forest. The larger number went directly south with their wounded chieftain, but a portion broke up into small bands in pursuit of plunder. One of these small parties strayed as far east as Wolf Hills \u2014 now Abingdon \u2014 in the \"Holston Valley\" district of Vir ginia. The Rev. Charles Cummings had been pastor of two congregations here since 1772. He was a godly man, and a very efficient member of the church militant \u2014 what in our days would be termed a \"fighting par son.\" It was his custom on Sundays to array himself in his clerical vestments, and, with a shot-pouch slung about his neck and a rifle thrown over his shoulders, to enter his church, and, thus armed, ascend the pulpit. Then, laying his pouch on the cushion before him, and stand ing his rifle in a corner, he would begin religious services to a congregation armed in much the same manner. As this gentleman with four others was going to work"], [141, "THE FIRST STRUGGLE. 121 in his field a few days after the battle near Fort Patrick Henry, they were suddenly attacked by one of Dragging Canoe's marauding bands. The first fire killed one \u2014 who had fought in the battle \u2014 and wounded two of the others ; but with the remaining man Cummings beat back his twenty assailants, and brought off the wounded men in safety. He subsequently accompanied Sevier in most of his campaigns ; and it was profanely said of him that he never went into a fight without stripping off his coat, \" praying like time, and then fighting like \u2014 hades ! \" It was this man, with about a hundred of his parish ioners, who was now hurrying to the relief of the be leaguered garrison at Watauga. Evan Shelby also raised a hundred horsemen and marched to the fort ; but, before the arrival of either party, Oconostota had hastily raised the siege and withdrawn to the Tellico. Oconostota did not set out upon his raid along the border until he had been told by John Stuart that the guns of Sir Peter Parker had opened upon Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor. As has been said, the two attacks were parts of one huge plan, involving a vast expense, and nearly a year's preparation. A large fleet and five thousand British soldiers and seamen were employed in the seaboard attack, but on the 28th of June, 1776, it was repulsed by precisely four hundred and thirty-five men posted behind a pile of palmetto-logs in the harbor of Charleston. This is well-known history ; and we have now seen how less than half that number of raw back woodsmen, led by Sevier and Shelby, frustrated the o"], [142, "122 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. other half of the mighty combination. In brief, two separate forces, numbering all told only six hundred and forty-five men, acting widely apart and without concert, brought to naught a most skillfully conceived and ma turely considered plan, backed by the whole power of the British Empire."], [143, "CHAPTER VI. RETRIBUTION. The attempt of Stuart to unite the Southern Indians in a combined attack upon the border settlements was successful. There was a general uprising in his depart ment. The Choctaws, Creeks, and Erati Cherokees de scended upon South Carolina and Georgia ; the Shaw nees, Delawares, and Mingoes upon the back counties of Virginia ; and, as we have seen, the Ottari Cherokees and Chickamaugas upon the Watauga settlements. The attack on Virginia was led by the Cherokee chief Raven, but he turned back without striking a blow on learning of the repulse of Oconostota and Dragging Canoe on the Holston and Watauga. Therefore I am right in saying that four hundred and thirty-five men under Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, and two hundred and ten under Sevier and Shelby in the backwoods of Carolina, beat back this front and rear assault from five thousand British and not less than fifteen thousand Indians. Napoleon affirmed that Providence is always on the side of the heaviest artillery ; but a recent orator has said that \" One with God is a majority.\" It soon became known among the colonists that this"], [144, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 124 concerted raid of the Indians had been instigated by Great Britain. Before the attack upon Charleston, Stu art had left that city in great haste, leaving behind him some of his books and papers. These fell into the hands of the patriots. Among them were copies of his corre spondence with Cameron, his agent residing among the Cherokees, which disclosed the whole of his atrocious plan to whelm in blood the Southern colonies. About the same time, also, a stranger rode up one night to the door of Charles Robertson at Watauga, and left with him a letter from Henry Stuart, a brother of Captain Stuart, who was then with the Cherokees. This gentleman was in no way related to James Robertson, but he was a true patriot. However, it must have been supposed by Stuart that he was secretly loyal to the crown, for he disclosed to him the British plan, and invited him to come to the Cherokee nation, or else to sign a paper owning alle giance to King George. This last would protect him from the \" inevitable ruin \" which he said was about to over take all enemies of Great Britain. It was also soon dis covered that British officers, disguised as Indians, had in many instances led and directed the attacks of the sav ages. These facts, communicated to the \"committees of safety \" which existed in every county, were soon spread abroad among the people, and excited everywhere general indignation. When a Christian king was thus seen band ing together the savages for the extermination of his own kindred, every man became a patriot ; it decided the"], [145, "RETRIBUTION. 125 wavering and fired the lukewarm to resist to the death the rule of the British Government. Havoc and burning and the tomahawk might be in every man's dwelling, but that were better than submission to a king who in cited the midnight murder of women and children. Thus aroused, the colonists rose and fell upon the In dians. A force from Georgia swept the Creek towns on the Tugaloo River ; in early August eleven hundred and fifty South Caroliuians met and utterly defeated Cam eron and a large body of Tories and Cherokees at Oco noree ; and North Carolina embodied two thousand men under General Rutherford, who penetrated the mountain region as far as the Hiwassee, defeated the Erati Chero kees, and laid waste the whole Indian territory. Thirty or forty towns were burned, crops and cattle destroyed, and the Indians scattered among the forests in a starv ing condition. Simultaneous with these events, Patrick Henry, then Governor of Virginia, directed Colonel Christian, of the Backwater settlements, to embody the border-men and descend upon Oconostota on the Tellico. They rendez voused at the Great Island of the Holston, eighteen hun dred strong, and iu the first days of August set out on a march of nearly two hundred miles into the Indian coun try. With them went Isaac Thomas as guide, James Robertson at the head of the men of Watauga, and John Sevier in command of a select company of scouts, who were to serve as the eyes and ears of the army. What is surprising is the promptness with which these various"], [146, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 126 forces were embodied, and the celerity of their move ments. This is accounted for by the fact that every frontiersman was a soldier and acted as his own commis sary. With his pouch filled with parched corn, he trusted to his rifle for the remainder of his rations. Thus it was parched corn and gunpowder that carried civilization beyond the Alleghanies. In a few days Thomas had led the army to the cross ing of the French Broad River. Here the Indians, to the number, as is variously stated, of one to three thou sand, had made a stand, and prepared to resist the in vasion. The great war-path which here crossed the river led into the richest part of their country, and the Indi ans were at first determined to defend the crossing to the last extremity; but a white trader, named Starr, who was among them, dissuaded them from any attempt at resistance. In an earnest harangue he told them it was folly to contend with the white man, that the Great Spirit intended he should overrun and occupy all the lowlands that could be cultivated. To the red-man he had given the hills and forests where he might subsist on game without tilling the soil, which was work fit only for women. To struggle with the white man was, there fore, to fight with destiny ; the only safety for the Indi ans lay in a speedy retreat to their mountain fastnesses. Owing perhaps to this harangue, but more probably to the tidings of disaster which came to them from every quarter, a panic ensued among the Cherokees. They disbanded and dispersed, making no organized attempt"], [147, "RETRIBUTION. 127 at resistance. However, small parties hung upon the skirts of the whites, ready for a struggle with destiny \u2014 whenever it could be taken at a disadvantage. Crossing the river, the whites found the Indian camp broken up and deserted ; but they pressed rapidly on to the Cherokee towns along the Little Tennessee and Tel lico. Every one of those towns was burned except Echota. The standing grain was destroyed, the cattle were slaughtered, not enough corn was left in all the country for a solitary hoe-cake \u2014 except at Echota. That town, and all within it, was spared, because it was the home of Nancy Ward, the friendly prophetess. But on the village high up in the mountains, in which young Moore was burned, fell, if possible, a more severe retri bution. Sevier went to it in person ; and ever afterward, for more than twenty years, his name was a terror among the Cherokees. Not a woman or a child was injured ; hut it is significantly stated that \"no males were taken prisoners.\" Sevier began then his system of \"carrying the war into the enemy's country.\" The campaign lasted three months ; but not a sin gle white man was killed or wounded, which was the more remarkable, as the Indians on several occasions attempted to ambush small parties. Thus were the sav ages consumed in the fire of their own kindling. The Cherokees were considered the most guilty, and on them fell the severest chastisement. Their wigwams \u2014 which the Indian loves as the white man does his home \u2014 were desolated, and their wives and children were brought to"], [148, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 128 the very verge of famine. For this is war, civilized or uncivilized, which lets loose among men the all-devour ing, remorseless passions which are born in the dark abodes of sheol. And now Oconostota, his pride humbled, his spirits broken, and many of his bravest warriors lying unburied in the forest, sued for peace with his enemies. It was granted, but only on condition that he should make other large cessions of the territory to which he clung as the only guarantee of the continued existence of his race and nation. Even harder conditions might have been exacted, for the nation, like its king, was complete ly subdued and disheartened. Only one man among them still carried himself erect, and defied his enemies. This was Dragging Canoe, head chief of the Chicka maugas. Still smarting from his wounds, and his sore defeat by a white stripling, he stood aloof, indomitable and, as he deemed, invincible. He refused to \"come in,\" and swore eternal vengeance against the white set tlers. Among the men in Colonel Christian's army were many from the interior counties of Virginia, who saw now for the first time the limpid streams, the rich valleys, and luxuriant uplands of lower Tennessee, and experienced its genial climate, where the heats of Au gust and September are tempered by a cool breeze which comes continually down from the mountain altitudes, \"stealing and giving odors.\" They were enraptured with the country ; and, even before peace was con-"], [149, "RETRIBUTION. 129 eluded, they chose out spots for the homes to which they soon afterward emigrated. Thus was the little commonwealth on the Watauga strengthened by the very efforts which the British and Indians had made to destroy it. And the war, and the danger from the Indians, did not drive away any of the original settlers. They saw how, unaided, they had repulsed their assailants, and they felt no fear for the future. The struggle had drilled them to military life, and inspired them with a contempt for their savage enemies. In the words of their old historian,* their question henceforth was, \"Where are they to be found?\" not \"How many are they ? \" No better material for soldiers ever existed. They were active, fearless, patient of fatigue, inured to hardship, and expert with the rifle, the most deadly weapon then in existence. They only needed a leader to become, though but a handful, an invincible host, which should put a girdle of fire round the rude cra dle of Western civilization. And that leader was even then standing among them, and, in the providence of God, being trained for the important work he was to do for his country. He won no glory in this campaign, for he met no enemy ; but as commander of the scouts he thoroughly explored the country, so that every stream, every hill, every mountain-path, was distinctly mapped in his memory, which is said to have been so remarkable * Ilaywood."], [150, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 130 that he could at a later time, when the head man among a hundred thousand, call by name every man, woman, and child in the territory. Moreover, at this time he met, and became familiar with, the Backwater men, and the rough riders of Wilkes and Surry, whom he was afterward to lead, with the brave Campbell and Cleve land, on that long march to King's Mountain. A suspension of hostilities being agreed upon, to be followed by a formal treaty in the ensuing April, the army was now marched back to the Holston, and there disbanded \u2014 all but four hundred Backwater men under Evan Shelby and Anthony Bledsoe, who were retained to patrol the Watauga settlements ; for it was not deemed safe to leave them exposed to the raids of Dragging Canoe and his horde of Chickamaugas. These Indians, though numbering not more than fifteen hundred warriors, were the most ferocious and formidable of any along the border. Nominally Chero kees, they were in reality a mongrel horde, part Creek, part Cherokee, and part renegade white men, who on account of their crimes had fled from the seaboard set tlements. Herding with these Indians, these white men had become worse than the savage, more lawless, untam able, and bloodthirsty. Owning a slack allegiance to Oconostota, the tribe was yet practically independent, a band of outlaws, thieves, and murderers, with a hand against every man, and numbering among them the very worst characters, white and red, to be found upon the border. Dr. Ramsey appropriately terms them \"the"], [151, "RETRIBUTION. 131 Barbary powers of the West,\" and their country \"the Algiers of the American interior.\" The region they at this time occupied is the most picturesque in all Tennessee. Their towns were scattered along the two banks of the river of that name from Chickamauga Creek to below Nick-a-jack Cave, and thus they held the southern gateway of the Alleghanies. The same causes which have led the modern engineer to lay here the tracks of eight great railways, and which have made this point the center of some of the most important military operations of this century, led the untutored Indian to select it as the crossing-place of his hunting and war parties in their excursions south to the Coosa and Tallapoosa, and north to the Cumberland and Ohio. It commands both the river and the pass into the mountains, and moreover is full of well-nigh inaccessible fastnesses, where a handful of men might defy an army. To these secret recesses the Chickamau gas, when hard pressed, could resort, and laugh to scorn the impotent wrath of their enemies. The scenery of the whole region is picturesque and beautiful beyond description. About eight miles below Chickamauga Creek, and two and a half from the pres ent city of Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain lifts its huge bulk above the clouds. The river flows at its base, and from its opposite bank rises Walden's Ridge, in a long range a thousand feet high, and crowned with towering oaks and poplars, which have stood there for centuries. The view from the top of Lookout is to-day"], [152, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 132 one of the most magnificent to be anywhere seen in this country. The eye ranges into five States, over spreading forests, waving fields, scattered farm-houses, and populous towns, nestling among high mountains that roll away in successive billows, as if they were the crested waves of some fearfully disturbed ocean, which had been arrested and petrified in its onward sweep ages before man was created. The tall cliffs of Cum berland Gap, a hundred and sixty miles away, are dis tinctly visible ; and through the whole wide landscape winds the silvery Tennessee, now hidden by some over hanging wood, now emerging into some grass-covered valley, but ever rushing on, broadening as it comes, till it pours around the foot of Lookout, a foaming torrent half a mile in width. Then, as if loath to leave the abodes of men, it turns back upon itself in a sharp curve, forming a curious bend, which, from its resem blance to the human foot, was called by the Indians Moccasin Point. Then the river plunges into a nar row gorge between the jutting cliffs of Walden's Ridge and Raccoon Mountain, and winds again its tortuous way till, a mere silver thread, it is lost in the haze of the far northwest. For several miles below Lookout Mountain the Ten nessee is a foaming rapid, where, contracted into a narrow channel, between overhanging cliffs, the furious waters dash from side to side, and rush madly on, over huge bowlders and masses of rock, in a thousand cas cades and whirlpools. Vast sums have been expended"], [153, "RETRIBUTION. 133 in late years to remove these obstructions, but even now navigation at this point is difficult and dangerous. At the time of which I write, these rapids could not be passed except at high water, and then a light canoe, a steady hand, and the most skillful of oarsmen, were needed to avert disaster. All along the river for miles the shores are bold, frowning with bare rock, or over grown with tangled wildness ; but as Nick-a-jack Cave is neared, some twenty miles below Chattanooga, this wildness deepens into a most oppressive solitude. Over the whole shore and river there broods, even now, a som ber silence, a dreary loneliness, which seem to invite to deeds of violence and crime ; and what must it have been before law had overspread this region, when no human eye was here to witness, \"no vigilance to detect, no power to punish, no force to avenge \" the dark deeds which were often committed by the bloodthirsty Chicka maugas ! For this is the scene of some of their foul est crimes, and from these gloomy retreats they laughed at their pursuers. Their principal hiding-place was Nick-a-jack Cave, a spacious, gloomy cavern, entered from the river, which at this point is contracted into a narrow channel, and overhung by projecting cliffs and towering precipices. Both of its banks are here bold and elevated, and in some places the bare, perpendicular rock affords scarcely a foot hold between the cliffs and the river. Here and there a cove indents the shore, where are wooded recesses that would shelter and conceal a thousand ; and break-"], [154, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 134 ing in from the foot of Cumberland Mountain, round which the river sweeps in a furious flood, is a narrow opening that leads into this now well-known cavern. The cave is about eighty feet wide, and in the center fifteen feet high, and it is arched over with pure gran ite. A clear stream, fed by underground springs, issues from it, and following this a canoe can proceed four or five miles into the very bowels of the mountain. In this vast cavern, and the neighboring caves, the Chickamaugas took refuge when pursued by Sevier and his riflemen. The place was then altogether unknown to the whites ; but, had it been known, a hundred reso lute men could have defended it against any force that Sevier could have brought against it. The war had not extended to this home of Dragging Canoe ; his corn was still standing ; and, secure in these unassailable fastnesses, and fired also by a revenge which the religion of the Indians exalted into a virtue, he now refused all overtures for peace, and impatiently waited for the healing of his wound that he might again sound the midnight war-whoop about the white man's dwell ing. But the winter passed away without any molestation from the Cherokees. The nation at large had enough to do to keep soul and body together, and the Chickamaugas, who had corn and provender in plenty, had acquired a wholesome dread of the white settlers. They would not move without Dragging Canoe, and he still lay upon his buffalo-robe at the mouth of Chickamauga Creek,"], [155, "RETRIBUTION. 135 writhing with his wound, and venting his rage in impo tent declarations of war against the pale-faces. So the settlers had time for social converse and meditation, which last is said to be the mother of all wisdom. They met together in their rude cabins, and discussed the situation ; and then Sevier reminded them that they had shown the ability to defend themselves, and might now safely dispense with the guard of four hundred men so generously loaned them by Patrick Henry. Every man that Virginia could muster was needed on the seaboard. Besides, Oconostota and the great body of Cherokees would not again go upon the war-path till they had planted and harvested another crop of corn; and as for Dragging Canoe and his bandits, Robertson and he could attend to them, now that a force of more than two hundred men could be quickly got together in the settlements. If they could not, Evan Shelby, who was only forty miles away, would hasten to their help at the first sound of their rifles. This Sevier said, and it was acted upon, except that Shelby in going away insisted upon leaving a garrison in Fort Patrick Henry. This would relieve the settlers from station duty, and permit them to give their un divided time to peaceful employments. However, Sevier was cautious as well as bold. He gathered the settlers together around two stations, one under himself, the other under Robertson, and both with Fort Lee between them and the enemy. Nor did he relax his personal vigilance. Mounted on a fast animal he was everywhere,"], [156, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 136 at all hours of the day and night ; for he had more faith in his own eyes than in those of any other man, however clear-sighted. So the winter wore away, and spring arrived, and the Legislature of North Carolina came together. Hith erto the State had acted as if not aware that she had an unprotected child, housed in some exposed hut off there beyond the Alleghanies. She had neglected its infancy and its feeble youth, though, even when it was scarcely able to go alone, it had prepared to go to her aid in her struggle with the gigantic power across the ocean. But this she had ignored ; and she had left it, when set upon by overpowering numbers, to get its help from Virginia, and had moved against its ene mies only when there was danger that they would scale her own back fence and make havoc in her farm-yard. Now that the youth had shown he could not only stand alone, but soundly thrash his own and her enemies, his anxious step-mother thought it was about time he should be kept in order and brought under the dominion of law. He might continue to feed and clothe and defend him self, but she would guide and govern and control him. So she threw over him what some of her lawyers called the \u00e6gis of North Carolina, gave him courts of pleas and quarter-sessions, to decide suits, and pass judgment upon offenders, and a sheriff to execute the decisions of these tribunals. Moreover, she gave him an entry taker, of whom he might buy lands which he had al ready bought and paid for, and to whom he might pay"], [157, "RETRIBUTION. 137 taxes, for the privilege of living under her protection, she herself being too weak to protect herself, and too poor to pay for a barrel of gunpowder ! To all this Watauga assented ; but the settlers took good care that the officials set over them should be men of their own choosing. They elected Valentine Sevier sheriff, and John Sevier clerk of the county ; and they placed over the new courts John Sevier, James Rob ertson, and the other judges who had constituted the self-formed tribunal which up to that time had se cured uninterrupted peace and good order iu the new community. So the change was merely nominal. Se vier and Robertson continued to embody in themselves all judicial and administrative functions : they merely no longer acted in their own names, but by authority of the State. \" Hereafter,\" as is said by Dr. Ramsey, \"Watauga, happy, independent, free, and self-reliant, the cradle of the great West, is merged into and be comes a part of North Carolina.\""], [158, "CHAPTER VII. PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. Oconostota, and the head men of the Cherokees, met the commissioners of Virginia and North Carolina, in the spring of 1777, to arrange the details of the peace ; and, while they were exchanging the \" diplomatic courtesies\" which are customary on such occasions, Dragging Canoe got again upon horseback, and came down upon the Watauga settlers with a \" talk \" not so courteous, but far more in harmony with the nature of the Indian. He brought with him the greater num ber of his warriors, but he did not attack in any large body. Breaking his force into small parties, he in tended to fall at midnight upon exposed stations aud isolated farm-houses, and to vanish before morning into the security of the forest. His first attack was on Frederick Calvert, one of the original settlers, whom he shot and scalped in his own house. Calvert sur vived, but to meet a worse fate some ten years afterward. Before morning of the same day \u2014 April 10, 1777 \u2014 Dragging Canoe himself, with a considerable body of his warriors, stole upon Robertson's barn, near his dwell ing, on the upper end of the island in the Watauga,"], [159, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 139 and got away with ten of his finest horses. Robert son discovered the loss in the morning, and then, with only the nine men that he had with him on his plan tation, he followed on the trail of the marauders. He soon came up with and surprised the Indians, killing one of them and recapturing the animals. The savages scat tered into the forest ; but, ashamed of being routed by so small a force, Dragging Canoe gathered his men to gether again, and turned back upon the track of Rob ertson. Overtaking him not far from his house, he fired a volley which wounded two of the whites ; but, though largely outnumbered, Robertson beat off the Indians, and got safely home with all of his men and horses. This was the opening of a short war, during which Sevier may be said to have begun his long career as an Indian fighter. He had,. as we have seen, already en countered the savages in conflict ; but now, for nineteen years, he passed the larger part of his time in the sad dle. When the struggle began he had but a little more than two hundred men, and arrayed against him in open hostility were Dragging Canoe and his fifteen hundred desperate banditti, and, in treacherous amity, nine thousand allied Creeks and Cherokees, who pro fessed friendship, but were ready to strike a blow in aid of the Chickamauga chieftain whenever it could be done under cover of secrecy. Moreover, during the greater portion of these nineteen years, the whole of this large force was combined in open warfare against the whites ; and the fact that Sevier not only protected the infant"], [160, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 140 settlements, but finally completely crushed this strong body of savages, is proof that he was not only a sol dier, but a military genius of a high order. He led raw, undisciplined backwoodsmen into battle, and with the first wave of his hand, the first sound of his voice, trans formed them into soldiers and heroes. By some strange magnetic power he infused into them his own uncon querable spirit, till every one became invincible and irre sistible, a lightning-bolt that rent the Indian ranks as the electric fluid rends the serried forest. And he entirely reversed the tactics hitherto observed in Indian warfare. It was no longer a skulking behind trees, a patient and cautious waiting to take the foe at a disadvantage, but an open wood, an onward gallop, a wild halloo, and then a storm of bullets before which the Indians scattered like dry leaves before a November tornado. His move ments were like the wind, his attacks like the whirl wind \u2014 a rush and a roar, and then a silent scene of death and devastation ! He never took thought of his personal safety, was ever in the hottest of the fight, aud the flash of his sword told always where to look for the largest heaps of slain, yet in thirty-five battles he never was so much as wounded. He seemed to bear a charmed life, and the missiles to pass him by as if they were con scious that he was reserved to do a great work for his country. This is remarkable ; but his great military achievements can be easily accounted for. They were due to his tactics of \"Attack, and not defense,\" and to the celerity of his movements, which disconcerted and"], [161, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 141 confounded his enemies. He fought on foot, but he moved on the fleetest of horses, and he never stopped to consult a commissary. His scouts might creep stealthily through the woods, without bending a branch or stirring a leaf, to get upon the trail of the enemy ; but, that once discovered, Sevier's movement was as swift, as direct, and as destructive, as that of the hurricane. Thus it was that he girdled with a wall of fire the infant settlements along the Holston and Watauga, often meeting enemies of twenty times his own number, without ever losing a battle. If I were to recount his operations in detail, I should swell this volume to much beyond its intended compass. I can only mention those which have a direct bearing on the course of this history. Dragging Canoe was active and brave, and he moved with great rapidity ; but wherever the Indians appeared, even in small bodies, there were they met by Sevier, or some of his trusted lieutenants, among whom may be mentioned his two brothers, Valentine and Robert, Major Cosby, Captain Evans, and Major Jonathan Tip ton, who all displayed superior qualities as border sol diers. Small companies of rangers under these men regularly patrolled the more exposed localities, and trusty spies constantly scoured the woods and canebrakes in the neighborhood of the settlements. These precau tions effectually guarded the settlers from surprise, and prepared them to successfully meet the midnight raids of the savages. Tired at last of continual defeat, and disgusted with"], [162, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 142 this new mode of warfare of the whites, Dragging Canoe retired, toward the close of the summer, to his secure fastnesses along the Tennessee, to wait there for a time when, with the help of Oconostota, he could combine the entire Creek and Cherokee nations in another gen eral assault upon the settlements. This he could not then do, for Robertson was stationed among them, and had acquired the warm friendship of old Tassell, Sava nuca, and other of the leading chieftains, and such an ascendency over the Cherokee nation at large, as held in check the machinations of Oconostota and the Brit ish agent. The treaty of peace with the Indians had been signed on the 20th of July, 1777, and on the same day Robertson was commissioned as agent for North Carolina to reside among the Cherokees. By written instructions from the Governor, he was directed to repair to Echota, with the warriors returning from the treaty, and to remain in the Cherokee country till otherwise ordered. He was to ascertain the disposition of the nation toward the whites, its relations with the northern, southern, and western tribes, and to report on these, and particularly on any manifestation of re newed hostility on the part of Dragging Canoe and the Chickamaugas. He was also to search in all the Indian towns for persons disaffected to the American cause, to require of them an oath of allegiance to the United States, and, in case of their refusal to make such oath, to cause their expulsion from the Cherokee terri-"], [163, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 143 tory. And, in addition, he was to procure the restora tion of all property which had been stolen from the whites, \"to inform the government of all occurrences worthy of notice, to conduct himself with prudence, and to obtain the favor and confidence of the chiefs ; and, in matters with respect to which he was not par ticularly instructed, he was to exercise his own dis cretion, always keeping in view the honor and interest of the United States in general, and of North Carolina in particular.\" This important appointment came to Robertson un sought. Speaking of it in later years, he said : \" With out inquiring how, I found myself invested with office by the Old North State ; we lived and fought as neigh bors, for each other, and our united country. Whether we were Virginians or Carolinians we asked and cared not ; we were all for the general Congress and for Washington.\" The appointment required a long separation from his family, and his abode amid a barbarous and turbu lent people, from some of the disaffected among whom his life might at any time be in danger ; but Robertson did not for a moment hesitate in accepting the duties and hazards of the position. He resided with the Cherokees for more than a year, and, by his \" winning ways\" and practical wisdom, succeeded in completely thwarting the plans of the British agent, backed as they were by the treacherous influence of the archi magus of the nation. The great body of Creeks and"], [164, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 144 Cherokees were kept at peace, and even the fierce and untamable Dragging Canoe was held to his hunting grounds along the Tennessee. This last result was, however, mainly owing to the wholesome dread which this chieftain had conceived of Sevier and his riflemen ; against whom he no longer dared to move without the support of his whole nation. Thus freed from active operations against Dragging Canoe, Sevier was able to afford men and supplies for the relief of Boone, who was now beleaguered by a swarm of northern Indians in his fort at Boonesborough. This siege forms one of the most remarkable pages in border history. It began on the 4th of July, 1777, and lasted till well into the following September, and at its outset the fort had but a slender garrison, and a meager sup ply of corn and ammunition. Without help the garri son would soon be reduced to starvation ; but how to obtain it with the place beleaguered by thousands of Indians, who, under the lead of skillful British officers, guarded every outlet, was the question. In this emer gency the brave Captain Logan volunteered to run the gantlet of the savages, and make his way to Watauga. It was two hundred miles through an untrodden forest, with only the sun and stars to guide his course ; but, with a select party of woodsmen, Logan set out on the perilous journey. Under cover of a dark night, he crept noiselessly from the fort, and, by hiding in the underbrush, managed to elude the savages. Then with but a single sack of parched corn for rations, the party"], [165, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 145 journeyed by unfrequented ways, concealing themselves by day, and traveling only by night, till they came to Sevier at Watauga, about the time of Robertson's depart ure for Echota. Sevier gave them a hundred riflemen, loaded them down with supplies upon pack-horses, and sent them back to Boonesborough. This timely succor enabled the fort to hold out, and finally to beat off its assailants. As we go on with this history we shall see that, in as great a strait, Boone gave a like succor to Robertson. By the spring of 1778 Sevier was at the head of a well-equipped and disciplined force of over five hundred men, all of whom were inured to hardship, familiar with camp-life, and animated with a common spirit to resist to the death the oppressions of the British and the barbarities of the Cherokees. Hitherto immigration had come on pack-horses along the old Indian paths, or the narrow traces blazed by hunters ; but in 1777 a wide wagon-road had been opened across the mountains into Burke County, North Carolina, and whole caravans of settlers now poured over it, and spread upon the lands recently acquired from the Indians. They were generally men of larger property than the first settlers, and they added greatly to the prosperity and safety of the new commonwealth. Every able-bodied man among them, between the ages of eighteen and fifty, was at once enrolled in the militia, and over the whole Sevier was now placed by a regular commission as lieutenant colonel. Prior to this time he had held command by 7"], [166, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 146 \"the will of the people,\" who recognized in him their natural leader. Evan Shelby was about the same time commissioned a colonel in the Virginia line, and he \"how was in active service with the American forces upon the seaboard. But, though relieved for the moment from active service against the Indians, Sevier found at this time far more disagreeable employment for himself and his captains nearer home and in the heart of nearly every one of the settlements. While the majority of the peo ple east of the mountains were patriots, among them were a large number who still adhered to the cause of Great Britain. Some of these were orderly and respect able citizens ; but much the greater portion were a law less banditti, who, gathering in small gangs, prowled over the country, depredating upon the patriots, and in many instances committing inhuman atrocities upon unarmed men and unprotected women and children. Houses were sacked, their occupants stripped of food and clothing, and, when not murdered outright, often tied to trees, severely whipped, and left weltering iu their blood, to die of exposure or starvation, unless relieved by some neighbor, or a chance passer through the forest. During 1778 and 1779 these predatory and murdering bands rendered the condition of the western counties of North Carolina and that portion of South western Virginia lying upon the head-waters of the Holston, and known as the Backwater settlements, truly deplorable. Driven from the seaboard, these"], [167, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 147 desperadoes collected in sufficient strength to defy the patriot militia, and the war there became, what Stuart had planned it should be, a hand-to-hand con flict around every man's dwelling. It called forth the worst passions of both sides : civilized man became a savage ; aud the struggle one of life and death, in which one or the other party must be exterminated. Writing of this state of things in the Carolinas, General Greene says : \" The animosity between the Whigs and Tories renders their situation truly deplorable. There is not a day passes but there are more or less who fall a sac rifice to this savage disposition. The Whigs seem de termined to extirpate the Tories, and the Tories the Whigs. Some thousand have fallen in this way in this quarter, and the evil rages with more violence than ever. If a stop can not be put to these massacres, the country will be depopulated in a few months more, as neither Whig nor Tory can live.\"* Wilkes and Surry Counties, North Carolina, and the Backwater settlements of Virginia were distant from Watauga only from fifty to a hundred miles \u2014 the one being now accessible to it over the wagon-road which had been recently opened across the mountain, the other by the wide war-path that the Indians, time out of mind, had traversed up the Valley of Virginia. These districts were peopled, even more exclusively than Watauga, by a stalwart race of Presbyterians, of Scotch-Irish descent, and not unlike in general char- * Greene's \"Life of General Greene,\" vol. iii, p. 227."], [168, "148 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. acteristics to the famous Ironsides of Cromwell. They \"feared the Lord, but kept their powder dry,\" and were ever ready to throttle a bear, scalp an Indian, or engage in a hand-to-hand struggle with the most desperate Tory. They were worthy disciples of Parson Cummings, who preached to two of their congrega tions, and of whom it was said, as already mentioned, that on going into battle he would strip off his coat, \" pray like time, and then fight like sheol ! \" There was not a man among them who was not a patriot. As early as January 20, 1775, they had met together \u2014 Parson Cummings, Colonels Preston and Christian, William and Arthur Campbell, and other of their lead ing men \u2014 aud drafted and sent to the Continental Con gress an address in which they said : \"If no pacific measures shall be proposed or adopted by Great Brit ain, and our enemies attempt to dragoon us out of those inestimable privileges which we are entitled to as sub jects, and reduce us to slavery, we declare that we are deliberately and resolutely determined never to surren der them to any power upon earth but at the expense of our lives. These are our real, though unpolished, sentiments of liberty and loyalty, and in them we are resolved to live and die.\" It was among such a people that the Tories had now scattered in small bands, and were attempting to sustain themselves by midnight depredations. The reception they received may be gathered from a few instances of well-authenticated history."], [169, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 149 About one mile east of Seven-Mile Ford, and not far from the present town of Marion, in Southwest Virginia, lived Colonel William Campbell, who held command of the Backwater district. He was a man of decided char acter and opinions, God-fearing and church-going, but liable upon provocation to outswear what is related of the profane army in Flanders. He was particularly ob noxious to the Tories, who had placarded his gates, threatening his life, and on one dark night had waylaid him in a dense forest. He was of stalwart frame \u2014 \"six feet two inches, and well-proportioned \" \u2014 and of desper ate courage, and this had saved him from the midnight assassins. He had been away with his regiment in East ern Virginia, but, on the occasion now referred to, had returned home for a brief visit to his wife, who was a worthy sister of Patrick Henry. He had attended church on Sunday, as became a good Presbyterian, and was re turning home with his wife, and a few friends, when, looking up the road, he observed a man, mounted on a fine horse, turning abruptly into the woods, as if to avoid a meeting with the party of church-goers. This excited his suspicions, and, inquiring who the man was, Campbell was told that he was one Hopkins, an infa mous bandit and Tory, who had baffled all attempts to bring him to justice. Instantly putting spurs to his horse, he followed on the track of the fleeing desperado. After a hard chase he came up with him, and then, at the close of a desperate struggle in which he nearly lost his own life, he overcame and captured him. Then"], [170, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 150 Campbell rode back to his wife and friends, and in an swer to her eager question, \"What did you do with him?\" he said, merely, \"Oh, we hung him, Betty\u2014 that's all ! \" Quite as summary was the mode of dealing with this class of Tories in Surry and Wilkes Counties. The lead ing men in this district were Colonel Benjamin Cleveland and Major Joseph Winston, both of whom afterward fought bravely by the side of Campbell at King's Mount ain. Cleveland was a magistrate as well as a military man, and he became the terror of all the Tories in his region. He was a man of herculean proportions, rough and ready in his ways and summary in his judgments ; but he had withal a kindly and humane disposition, and took no pleasure in inflicting punishment and suffering upon even the most guilty. On one occasion one of the most notorious criminals in the county was brought be fore him, and promptly sentenced to be hanged. There being some delay in leading the man out to execution, Cleveland said, \" Waste no time, swing him off quick ! \" whereupon the criminal turned coolly upon him and re torted, \" You needn't be in such a d \u2014 d hurry about it, colonel ! \" Struck with the coolness of the man, Cleveland directed the excutioners to let him go. Sub dued by this unexpected turn of affairs, the Tory said to Cleveland, with much feeling : \"Well, old fellow, you've conquered me. Forever after this I'll fight on your side ! \" And he kept his word, becoming one of Cleve land's best soldiers."], [171, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 151 The fact that such a man should have been forced to send to execution nearly a hundred of bis fellow-creat ures reveals the lamentable condition of anarchy and terror that ruled in this mountain-region during the Revolutionary period. It was \"your life or mine \" ; the two classes could by no possibility exist together. Even woman forgot her gentler nature, and became as inex orable a judge as the most severe magistrate. It is re lated that on one occasion, during the absence of Colonel Cleveland, a Tory horse-thief was brought to the house to be tried for his offenses. There being no safe place to con fine the prisoner, and, fearing he might escape before their father's return, the colonel's sons went to their mother for advice as to what to do in the circumstances. Ask ing the criminal's offense, and learning that the evidence against him was overwhelming, Mrs. Cleveland inquired what their father would do with the man if he were at home. \"Hang him,\" was the answer. \"Well, then,\" she said, \"you had better hang him.\" He was accord ingly hanged from the cross-bar of the gate in front of her doorway. It is evident that such a condition of things could not continue long in any community. The patriots were in the majority, and such as were left of the Tories at length fled to the Indians or across the mountains to the settlements along the Holston and Watauga. Had they been content to adopt peaceful pursuits, they might have here dwelt in security. But they were not. They at once began the same system of plunder and massacre that"], [172, "152 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. had made them a scourge to the older communities. Under the lead of a Captain Grimes, they soon waylaid and murdered a peaceable citizen named Millican ; and another they kidnapped, and, bearing him to a high precipice on the upper waters of the Watauga, forced him, by threats to cast him down headlong, to buy his life at the sacrifice of all his property. Other outrages soon followed, and they even planned to murder Sevier in his own dwelling ; and doubtless they would have done this \u2014 for he slept with doors unbarred \u2014 had they not been betrayed by the wife of one of them, who, in her distress, had been treated by Sevier with great humanity. Nothing but this last attempt was needed to arouse the settlers to a flame of exasperation. The courts of pleas and quarter sessions, which had been established among them by North Carolina, had no jurisdiction in capital cases \u2014 they could not hang for murder \u2014 and such good order had hitherto ruled in the settlements that there had been no occasion for a court of higher author ity. But the necessity now was urgent \u2014 too urgent to admit of the long delay that would be involved in any reference to North Carolina. So these people, who had once had an independent existence, again assumed to themselves supreme authority. They came together, passed their own laws, and elected a vigilance com mittee to attend to their execution. Every man \u2014 old settler or new-comer \u2014 was required to take an oath of allegiance to the United States, and, failing to do this, he was to be expelled from the district. Those that had"], [173, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 153 committed crimes were to be duly punished, but only after a fair trial by a jury regularly impaneled. Two companies of light horsemen, under Captain Robert Se vier and Captain William Bean, the first settler, were put by Colonel Sevier at the control of the vigilance committee, and they soon had administered the oath in every hamlet among the scattered settlements. Thus was good order speedily restored, and, by the end of sixty days, not a man who was not a patriot was left any where upon the waters of the Holston or Watauga. The Tories \u2014 such as had not been suspended from the branches of the chincapin \u2014 fled to Oconostota. Being refused asylum by him, owing to the continued presence of Robertson, who required of the Cherokees a strict ob servance of the treaty, they made their way to Dragging Canoe in his distant lairs along the Tennessee, and thus contributed to swell his band of outlaws. During the ten years which had now passed since the first settlement beyond the mountains, society had been gradually emerging from the hunter and pastoral state, to which it was of necessity at first confined, into the agricultural condition, wherein the simplicity of patri archal life is exchanged for the more artificial customs and relations of modern communities. Men no longer procured their principal subsistence from the forest, but from the soil, thereby coming under the original law, \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\" \u2014 which law, while it enforces greater toil, marks a higher grade of civilization."], [174, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 154 The opening of roads, which had introduced wheeled vehicles, had brought with them increased wealth and greater refinement. Dwellings became more comfortable, and barns were no longer exposed ricks, with a slight cov ering of split saplings. The saw came in to supplement the axe, plank floors took the place of rived puncheons, and even roofs began to be covered with shingles. The first house covered in this manner was erected in 1777, and its going up was deemed an event so notable that it has found its way into history. Logs, however, contin ued to be the usual material for the walls of houses, for nothing else was impervious to bullets, and security was still the prime requisite in a dwelling. Soon after the advent of courts, a county-seat was established and a court-house erected. The county-seat was duly incorporated by the Legislature, and named Jonesboro, in honor of a prominent North Carolinian, and a court-house was erected there in 1779. Heretofore the sessions of court had been held in the houses of prominent citizens, but now Justice was to have a domi cile of her own, from which to issue those stern decrees which struck terror into the hearts of Tories and horse thieves. However, her temple was not of the most im posing description. Her tripod was a rough bench, without a back, or a soft spot to sit on, and her bar a sawed joist which had never made the acquaintance of a jack-plane. The edifice was built of round logs, freshly cut from the adjacent forest, and the records of Wash ington County have preserved to us its exact specifica-"], [175, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 155 tion. It was to be \"twenty-four feet square, diamond corners, and hewn down after it is built up ; nine feet high between the two floors ; body of the house four feet above upper floor ; floors neatly laid with plank ; shingles of roof to be hung with pegs. A justice's bench, a law yer's and clerk's bar ; also, a sheriff's box to sit in.\" There was not a sash nor a pane of glass in the en tire building. But the absence of these was not regarded as a discomfort or an inconvenience. The sessions were usually held in mild weather, and, from the narrow di mensions of the court-room, much the larger number of attendants had to congregate outside on the grass and in the shade of the great trees which still towered there in primitive grandeur. Though excluded from the inner sanctuary of justice, this outside auditory could see and hear all the sacred proceedings by means of the wide, open windows. The sessions of court then, as now in that region, were occasions of great gatherings of the people. From far and near they came together, not merely to transact business with the court, but to ex change news, discuss the political situation, and decide which among them had the fastest racers. A good horse was a passion among this people. From the first, Sevier had encouraged the introduction and raising of the finest breeds, for upon fleet animals he depended for the celerity of his movements against the Indians. A fine animal was not merely a luxury to be proud of, but a military necessity whereon might often hang the safety of the scattered community. Hence, a"], [176, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 156 fleet and trusty horse was the most valuable of possessions. Sevier himself cultivated the choicest breeds, and to him, and to the necessity which he was the first to appre ciate and provide for, is it owing that Tennessee and Kentucky have to-day the finest stock of racing animals in the world. In the wake of the court came the attorney, and the records show that, in one way or another, two of this fraternity managed to sustain life in the new settlements. There is no evidence to determine whether they subsisted upon fees, or by the raising of corn and potatoes ; but the names of the two having come down to us, we are able to affirm that they never attained to any especial prominence or influence in the community. Of more importance to the body politic was the schoolmistress, who now was to be found at nearly every cross-road in the older settlements. She was usually a single woman, of uncertain age, who, having no children of her own, was supposed to be the better able to instruct those of other people. She occupied a small log-house, generally about sixteen feet square, and often without floor or win dows, and, if she was not a shining light of erudition, she did turn out men and women many of whom became or naments to the nation. These rude school-houses were for several years the only places of worship, but in 1779 a building was erected which was especially devoted to religious services. A Baptist congregation was organized, and over it was in stalled the Rev. Tidence Lane, who thus became the first"], [177, "PEACE WHICH WAS NOT PEACE. 157 settled minister of the gospel beyond the Alleghanies. Before him, however, had come the Rev. Samuel Doak, who journeyed about the settlements, and preached, like John, in the open wilderness. Mr. Doak was a man of rare qualities, and from the first exerted a strong and wide influence upon the community. Next to Sevier and Robertson, he was the most important factor in the young commonwealth, not acting like them directly upon events, but upon the men by whom events were created. In this way he was a great power for good. He founded Washington College, and gave the whole of his long life to the promotion of education, good order, and good morals among the backwoods people. Sevier and Rob ertson cleared the ground and turned up the furrow ; this man threw in the seed, which sprang up and bore a plentiful harvest to civilization. And now, at the close of 1778, there was peace beyond the mountains. Oconostota had been subdued. Drag ging Canoe was held in check, and the disorderly Tories had been driven to seek refuge among the congenial bandits on the lower Tennessee and Chickamauga. In these circumstances it was deemed prudent for Robert son to leave his post among the Indians, and return to the society of his family, and the comforts and refine ments of civilized life. Neither he nor Sevier then sur mised that events were at that moment impending which might drench their firesides in blood, and subject them and their descendants to the iron rule of a hated government."], [178, "CHAPTER VIII. ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. After the repulse of Sir Henry Clinton from before Charleston, and the defeat of the Cherokees on the frontier in 1776, the Southern colonies had a respite of nearly three years from British invasion. The ana conda system of Stuart had been temporarily aban doned, and the whole strength of the English con centrated upon the subjugation of the North. The re sults, however, were anything but satisfactory. After nearly four years of fighting, the British held New York, but had been obliged to evacuate Philadelphia, and their successes in the field had been more than coun terbalanced by the loss of the entire army of Burgoyne at Saratoga. But the situation of the Americans was by no means hopeful. The Northern army was reduced to seventeen thousand men, poorly equipped and provisioned ; and the finances of Congress were in so crippled a condition that no money could be raised for offensive operations. Loans could not be negotiated, and the Continental currency had depreciated to such an extent that twenty dollars had a purchasing value of only one dollar ! In"], [179, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA 159 these circumstances the patriot armies could merely maintain their ground ; they could make no movement toward the expulsion of the British forces from the country. This was the state of affairs when Sir Henry Clinton, in 1778, succeeded General Howe in command of the British forces in America. This active and enterpris ing officer had led the attack on Charleston in 1776, and was familiar with the plan of Stuart for a combined front and rear attack upon the Southern colonies. He saw that this period \u2014 when the American armies of the North were unable to move, and there was next to no patriot force embodied at the South \u2014 was a favorable time to again attempt to carry the gigantic plan into execution. This he accordingly decided to do ; and on this occasion he determined that the \"anaconda\" should take a wider sweep, and inwrap in its folds not only the South and Southwest, but the whole country lying east of the Mississippi. From his stronghold of Detroit, Henry Hamilton, the Lieutenant-Governor of Canada, was to combine and organize the Northern Indians, while Stuart and Oconostota marshaled the Southern tribes, and the British commander-in-chief descended upon Savannah, thereby flanking the pile of palmetto logs which in 1776 had ingloriously repulsed the com bined forces of Clinton and Sir Peter Parker. Savan nah taken, direct communication would be again opened between the British and Creeks and Cherokees, and there would be, as Clinton supposed, no opposing force"], [180, "160 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. that could prevent the co-operation of the Southern Indians with his Northern allies under Hamilton. A foothold secured in Georgia, Charleston would be taken from the land side, and a strong British force would then overrun all the Southern colonies, rallying the dis affected, and sweeping northward in such numbers as to defy opposition, and effectually subjugate the whole country. Such was the plan, sagacious, deeply matured, wide sweeping, and it seemed out of the power of the colonies to offer to it any effectual resistance. It did not, how ever, succeed ; and, in relating how it failed, I shall have to record another miracle in American history \u2014 another proof of the falsity of Napoleon's axiom that \"Provi dence fights always on the side of the heaviest artillery.\" Everything being in readiness, toward the close of 1778 the British columns were set in motion. On the 29th of December Savannah fell, with scarcely any resist ance, and British posts were at once established as far inland as Augusta. Direct communication being thus opened with the Creeks and Cherokees, a large supply of warlike stores was sent forward to Dragging Canoe at Chickamauga \u2014 not to Oconostota, lest tidings of the ar rival should reach Sevier and Shelby on the Watauga. This being done, Hamilton began to execute his part of the extended programme. With six hundred choice troops and some Indian allies, he advanced from Detroit to the fort at Vincennes on the Wabash, intending to march thence against Kaskaskia on the Mississippi, where"], [181, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 161 he expected to be joined by a large body of Cherokees and Chickasaws, with whom he would proceed to a general rendezvous of all the tribes at the mouth of the Tennessee. But Hamilton had a passion for scalps, and he halted at Vincennes to allow his Indian allies to gather these favorite trophies from among the neighboring white set tlers. By this halt his force was scattered and reduced, and this proved his destruction. Suddenly, one morn ing in March, as if springing out of the ground, there appeared before the gates of the fort a weather-beaten man, in tattered regimentals of the Continental serv ice, demanding its instant aud unconditional surrender. Where he had come from, or what force he might have at his back, Hamilton could not so much as conjecture ; but, when he learned his name, he took his demand into serious and respectful consideration. This man was George Rogers Clark, one of the most picturesque figures in American history. Patriotic, en ergetic, and ambitious, he had also a reckless intrepidity that led him to take delight in enterprises of the most adventurous and apparently impossible character. But he lacked the iron will, the unselfish and elevated aims, and the high moral qualities of Sevier and Robertson, and so he fell short of being a hero. He was more of the old-time knight-errant than the modern soldier, and he was not a born leader of men, like the two I have men tioned. However, he performed great services at this period to his country, and for these the mantle of char-"], [182, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 162 ity should be cast over his subsequent errors and short comings. The massacre in the Wyoming Valley, in the summer of 1778, awoke Virginia to the necessity of protecting her western frontier from the incursions of the Indians. Patrick Henry at once commissioned Clark to raise a regiment for that service ; and soon, with two hundred borderers, but without supplies or other equipment than the trusty Deckard rifle, he set out on foot for a march of nearly fifteen hundred miles down the Ohio and into the unknown wilderness of \"the Illinois.\" His bivouac was the open forest, his only subsistence the game he killed by the way, but, before winter had fairly set in, he had driven the savages to the west of the Mississippi, and captured the fort at Kaskaskia, near the west bank of that river. It was the purpose of Hamilton to attack Clark at Kaskaskia, and, with the aid he expected from the sav ages, he counted on making an easy conquest of him and his forces. Clark knew nothing of this design, nor of the mighty plan of which it was one of the feebler rami fications. He simply heard of the advance of Hamilton from Detroit, and divined that his objective point was Vincennes. With the instinct of the hound in pursuit of his game, he scented the prey afar off, and, with the directness and speed of that animal, he was at once on the trail of the enemy. Greater energy he could not have shown had he fully known what would be the con sequences of his movements. It was a march of a hun-"], [183, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 163 dred and fifty miles through dense forests, tangled un dergrowth, and deep morasses, where, time and again, he and his men waded to their arm-pits in water, breaking the ice before them for a passage ; but he kept on his way, and, on the morning of the 5th of March, 1779, ap peared, as I have said, before the fort, and demanded its surrender. Hamilton asked for terms, but Clark refused any to a \"scalp-trader,\" as he contemptuously termed the British commander. He peremptorily gave him his election between unconditional surrender and such quar ter as his savage allies were wont to extend to their ene mies. Without firing a shot, Hamilton accepted the former alternative ; and, when his well-appointed force stacked their arms and marched into the center of Clark's half-starved battalion, he had the chagrin to discover that he had surrendered to a body of but one hundred and sixty shoeless, ragged, and wretchedly equipped backwoodsmen ! On the charge of committing atrocities not countenanced in civilized warfare, Hamil ton was put in irons and marched off to Williamsburg, Virginia, there to be dealt with as a common felon. After a long and rigorous imprisonment, he escaped hanging only in consequence of the personal intercession of Washington with Thomas Jefferson, then Governor of Virginia. The head gone, the Northwestern coalition fell into speedy dissolution. Thus was so much of Clinton's plan frustrated. But the anaconda was scotched, not killed. The extremity had been shorn away, but the head"], [184, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 164 and trunk were still full of vital force, and the monster might yet, with slimy coil, infold the struggling colonies, crushing their life out in its deadly embrace. Dragging Canoe was invulnerable to British gold, but he had a weakness for British gunpowder ; for, savage as he was, he had the sense to know that, more than gold, it was the moving force of the eighteenth century \u2014 as, indeed, it will be of every coming century, until men recognize the fact that love, and not brute force, is the ruling power of the universe. Hitherto he had been destitute of that dynamic element, and though his recent re-enforcements of Tories had augmented his force to fully two thousand men, he was absolutely powerless ; for only a madman would think of confronting the rifles of Nolichucky Jack with empty gun-barrels. But now he had powder enough to celebrate the king's birthday every day in the year for a twelvemonth. ' It was intended that Dragging Canoe and Oconostota should not move until Hamilton had marshaled the Northern tribes at the mouth of the Tennessee, when the whole savage horde \u2014 numerous as the forest-leaves, and irresistible as the tornado \u2014 should sweep down on the unprepared settlements, whelming them in a swift and wide -spread destruction. The coalition of the Northern tribes was, as we have seen, soon scattered to the four winds ; but without them Dragging Canoe and Oconostota could muster for the field at least fifteen thousand well-armed Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees, and Chickasaws, every man of them brave and expert with"], [185, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 165 the rifle, and the whole led by so able a soldier as John Stuart, of the British Highlanders. And what force could the whites gather to withstand such an ava lanche of savages ? All told, they could now muster from fifteen hundred to two thousand men \u2014 a half of the number from around Watauga, led by Sevier and Shelby, and it may be as many more from Surry and Wilkes Counties, and the Backwater settlements, under Colonels Campbell and Cleveland. But this force was dispersed over a mountain country two hundred miles in extent. It would take time to bring it together, and the descent of the savages was intended to be sudden and without warning \u2014 a midnight raid in overpowering numbers upon every one of the scattered settlements. Thus the outlook for the whites was gloomy, and, to all who do not recognize an invisible agency in earthly affairs, it might well seem altogether hopeless. But now occurred one of those trifling events which are so often decisive of great results in human history. The vast combination of Hamilton had been frustrated by a lit tle delay ; this was to miscarry for an altogether oppo site reason. Dragging Canoe had been so long without powder that now, like a child with a new toy, he was impatient till he should be allowed to play with it. He knew that he was not to move till Hamilton had mustered the Northern tribes, and he himself had fully distributed the ammunition among the Southern Indians ; but his long good behavior had relaxed the vigilance of the whites,"], [186, "166 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. and some of their outlying settlements now lay sleep ing in fancied security, not more than sixty miles away. It might be weeks before the Northern snows would allow Hamilton to begin his march ; and meanwhile might he not gather a few scalps to ornament his wig wam ? The temptation was too great for the virtue of an undisciplined Indian, who had in possession arms and am munition of the specie value of a huudred thousand dol lars. So, about the time that Hamilton set out from Detroit, Dragging Canoe and a few of his warriors went upon a brief raid against the more exposed of the white settlements. In a midnight attack on the house of one Boilston, on the extreme frontier, he lost four of his braves, and killed two of the whites \u2014 Jarot Williams and Alexander Hardin, Indian traders who have been hitherto mentioned. He attacked a few other farm houses, but was beaten off without doing any material damage. Then, having done just enough to warn and arouse the settlers, he retired to his home on the Chicka mauga. A blow upon the extremity of the human body is at once transmitted by the nerves to the common cen ter of sensation, the brain. In like manner \u2014 so perfect was Sevier's system for transmitting intelligence \u2014 an at tack on the most remote border was, by trusty scouts, promptly conveyed to him at the center of operations, Watauga. Thus it was that now, before twenty-four hours had passed, his fleet light horsemen were patrol ling every hamlet and every by-path in the territory."], [187, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 167 Was the attack at Boilston's the precursor of an assault in force, or was it an isolated raid, originating in the restlessness of the Indian under his long-enforced inac tivity ? These were the questions that occurred to Se vier. A few days would answer them ; but, meanwhile, of one thing he was certain \u2014 the British had thrown over the mountains from Augusta a supply of ammu nition to the savages. It had come to Dragging Canoe, and not to Oconostota, lest he should be apprised of its arrival by his faithful friend the Cherokee prophetess. Robertson, with whom he was in the habit of conferring in all emergencies, was away with an exploring party upon the Cumberland ; therefore, when a few days had passed, and no general attack had followed, he saddled his horse and rode the forty miles that lay between him and Evan Shelby, at King's Meadows. At home with the sturdy Welshman were his four stalwart sons \u2014 Evan, Moses, James, and Isaac \u2014 the last of whom had been surveying lands in Kentucky, and act ing as commissary-general of the Virginia forces, since he last appeared in this history. The six men sat down to a conference upon the situation. They all agreed that it was evident the Indians had received a supply of arms and ammunition at Chickamauga, which must be captured at once, or by the time that spring had fully opened the whole force of Creeks and Cherokees would be upon the war-path. But how to capture it was the question. No one present had ever been at Chickamauga, but all knew that it was located among"], [188, "168 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. inaccessible mountains, and deemed to be impregnable to any attack by land. But might it not be assailed by water, if celerity and secrecy were observed in the movement ? And would not seven hundred to a thou sand men be enough to meet the two thousand Tories and savages assembled there, if the latter were taken by surprise, and unprepared for the encounter ? The foregoing points having been discussed, an im portant difficulty presented itself. The men could be readily enrolled, but the money to equip and supply them was altogether wanting. The existing war had so completely exhausted the resources of both North Caro lina and Virginia that it would be a mere waste of time to apply to either government for assistance. And aid from individuals was equally as hopeless. Not a man in the territory had in possession so much as a hun dred dollars of even the depreciated Continental currency then in general circulation. However, the Latin adage, that \"riches are the sinews of war,\" is a mistake. Far truer is the Jewish proverb, \"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.\" Among these six was a young man of only twenty-eight, whose name was so \"good\" that on it, for something more than a year, he had fed and clothed the entire armies of Virginia ; and he would pledge it now for this expedition, trusting to the British powder they hoped to capture to meet his obligations. This young man was Isaac Shelby, the same who had defeated Dragging Canoe at Long Island Flats, and turned the trembling scale at the close of"], [189, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 169 the terrible day at Point Pleasant. A rendezvous being then appointed for the mouth of Big Creek, on the Hol ston, not far from the present town of Rogersville, Se vier remounted his horse and rode back to Watauga. The machinery of war was at once set in motion. Swiftly the scouts of Sevier sped through the settlements, and promptly the hardy backwoodsmen gathered to the rendezvous. Then, when mounted patrols had been sta tioned in every direction, to prevent the possibility of intelligence reaching the enemy, a strong force set to work to build a fleet of boats for the expedition. Even at this day the poplar grows in this region to a diam eter of five feet and upward. These giant trees were felled, dug out with the axe and the adze, and fash ioned into canoes, and a few flat-bottomed boats were constructed of planks floated down from the saw-mill at Watauga. More than a hundred of these rude craft were soon launched upon the Holston, and it may be safely affirmed that another such maritime array was never seen in civilized warfare. About noon of the 10th of April, 1797, the flotilla drew out from the shore and started upon its way down the river. How many men were in the expedition it is impos sible to state with exactness, for the leaders did not always count their own troops, or those of an enemy. Accounts differ, but the most probable estimate is seven hundred and fifty \u2014 one fifth of whom had been shortly before enlisted by Colonel John Montgomery for the re-enforcement of George Rogers Clark, whose recent 8"], [190, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 170 brilliant exploit at Vincennes allowed them a short de lay in joining his forces. The remainder were drawn, in probably about equal numbers, from the Watauga and Backwater settlements, by Sevier and Evan Shelby. The force represented about one half of the military strength of the region, and a larger number it was not prudent to withdraw, because the advancing expedition would soon leave Oconostota in its rear, and he might descend upon the settlements if he should learn that they were unguarded. The whole was under the com mand of Evan Shelby, he being the senior and ranking officer ; but among the troops were Sevier and Isaac Shelby, and several others competent to lead an army. By the windings of the river the distance was three hundred miles, and they would enter an unknown wilder ness which only one man among them had ever visited by water. The river was on the spring freshet, and this had increased the usually rapid current to a most dangerous velocity ; besides, their pilot \u2014 named Hudson \u2014 told them that a part of the route was over dangerous shoals and through furious rapids, where a single false stroke might send their frail craft to the bottom. There was need, therefore, of care and skill to escape the perils of the river, and of silence and watchfulness to avoid the dangers of the land \u2014 for, seen by any rov ing savage, their movements might be made known to Oconostota. The little army had, in fact, undertaken a most hazardous enterprise. It was plunging into an unknown region, to attack a strongly posted force of"], [191, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 171 three times its number, when, by its very movements, it would create an enemy in its rear of about twice its own strength, and capable of doing it vital injury. So, silently the men plied their oars, and narrowly they watched the forests and undergrowth that lined the banks of the river. With muffled paddles, and at dead of night, they passed the mouth of the Little Tennes see, near which lay Oconostota and his twelve hundred warriors ; and soon afterward, with a bolder sweep, they pulled out of the Holston, and into the safer, because broader, Tennessee. In the early morning of the 13th of April they rounded to at the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, within a short distance of the lair of Dragging Canoe. The town stretched for a mile or more along the bank of a stream lined with canebrakes, the lower portion of which was now submerged by the freshet, so that the canoes could approach, entirely concealed, to the very doorways of the wigwams. About five hundred warriors occupied this place, the remainder having their homes in towns located at intervals lower down the river. As the first boat came to land, the men in it en countered a solitary Indian, whom they made a prison er, promising him his life if he would faithfully guide them to the ' quarters of Dragging Canoe. This the savage did, and a scene of the wildest confusion followed. Taken by surprise, and panic-stricken, the Indians made scarcely any resistance, but fled precipitately to the ad jacent woods and mountains. Forty warriors were killed"], [192, "172 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. on the spot, and Dragging Canoe and the rest were hunted to inaccessible jungles and mountain recesses where the troops could not penetrate. Meanwhile, a guard being placed over the magazine where was stored the British gunpowder, the torch was applied to every dwelling in Chickamauga, and soon all that was left of the town was a mass of smoking cinders. While this was going on, detachments were dispatched to the other towns along the river, and, before darkness came upon that day, no less than eleven conflagrations marked the spots where had stood as many Indian vil lages. Not a hut was spared, not a measure of meal, nor an article of provision. Twenty thousand bushels of corn were destroyed, and the routed warriors were left without subsistence, or any powder with which to secure game from the forest. Besides the great quan tity of arms and ammunition, the troops captured one hundred and fifty horses, a hundred head of cattle, and large stores of goods which the British had accumulated for distribution among their Northern allies. The work of destruction over, the troops broke up their boats, and, loading the spoils upon the captured horses, returned to their homes through the forest. The march was long and toilsome, but, before the close of a month, every man was at his home on the Hol ston or the Watauga. Thus speedily, and without the loss of a single life, did this small band of backwoods men destroy the vast coalition that was intended to sweep the border settlements from existence. For at"], [193, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 173 least a year to come the Southwestern Indians would be powerless \u2014 they could not subsist without corn, nor fight without ammunition, and, cooped up as the British soon were in Savannah, they were unable to lend them any assistance. And here I would again call attention to the fact that two small bodies of men, acting without concert, and widely apart, frustrated, for a second time, the gigantic plan by which the British commander expect ed to wind an anaconda coil about the Southern colo nies. It is within the scope of credibility to assign one such occurrence to what may be termed \"a fortuitous concourse of events,\" but can we in reason so account for two such occurrences ? And what if a third, quite as remarkable, should follow within a little more than a year, in which these same backwoodsmen would be the important actors ? Had the front been as successfully defended as the rear, the close of the year 1779 might have seen the end of British domination in America. But it was not so to be. For two long years the Southern sea-coast was to be furrowed with the red plowshare of war, and it was to be rescued at last from the clutch of the British lion by these same over-mountain men who had thus far so bravely stood as the rear-guard of the Revolution. At the occurrences on the sea-coast I shall have to glance briefly in another chapter ; now I must note in its chronological order an event which had an important bearing upon the progress of Western civili-"], [194, "174 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. zation. This was the departure of James Robertson from Watauga, and his settlement with a body of emi grants, on the Cumberland, at a distance of fifteen days' travel from the most westerly of the white settle ments. Though Sevier was the master-spirit and moving spring of every event beyond the Alleghanies, Robert son was nominally the \" head man \" in the Watauga community ; and he was honored, trusted, and beloved, by every man, woman, and child, throughout the scat tered settlements. Moreover, he was a man of marked and decided character, and his most characteristic trait, shown on numberless occasions through a long career, was strong, practical common sense. While he had the cool intrepidity that could confront, and by sheer moral force subdue, a horde of hostile Cherokees, he never ventured needlessly into danger. He was superlatively cautious, looking always before he leaped, and never adopting a course until he had carefully weighed all its consequences. What, then, could be his motive in now leaving the ease, security, aud comparative opulence he had acquired during ten long and perilous years, to plunge again amid the hardships, privations, and dangers of a distant wilderness, where he would be surrounded by savage foes, and far beyond all human succor ? The answer, I think, is to be gathered from the phrase that was ever on his lips, \"Man proposes, but God disposes.\" The feeling was upon him which was upon Luther when he said : \" God hurries and drives me. I am not mas-"], [195, "ANOTHER COIL OF THE ANACONDA. 175 ter of myself ; I wish to be quiet, but am hurried into the midst of tumults.\" The Scotch Presbyterianism, in which he had been educated, had revealed to him an Overruling Mind, directing all human affairs. That Power had not so strangely saved his life ten years be fore without a purpose, which purpose it had gradually dawned upon him was that he should be the forerun ner of civilization in the Western wilderness. This being his settled conviction, he was prepared to make every sacrifice and endure every hardship that came in the way of what seemed to him duty. And so, I believe, it has been with all men who have done any special work which has greatly benefited the world. They have recognized an invisible guiding, which has led them at times into acts that to mere worldly wisdom have seemed the extreme of folly. Robertson and Sevier were as hand and brain to one another. There was between the two that union of mind and soul which comes only to men who have the same aims and aspirations, and who have shared deadly perils together. And now Sevier remonstrated with Robertson. It was folly to leave his well- won honors ; it was madness to tempt again the dangers of an un trodden wilderness. Then Robertson, reticent with all others, but ever open with Sevier, disclosed to him his plans and purposes. The result was that Sevier said, \"Go, and I will go with you.\" But to this Robert son would not consent. The Watauga settlements, he said, without Sevier, would soon be broken up and"], [196, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 176 the settlers driven beyond the mountains. No other leader than he could carry them through the gloomy years that might be before them. They were both sol diers of civilization, and each had his allotted duty. It was Robertson's to lead the advance, Sevier's to guard the rear. Let each one do his allotted work, and leave the results to the Supreme Disposer. This is, in substance, what was said between Sevier and Robertson ; and then they parted, to meet again only at long intervals for sixteen years, when Sevier had crushed the Cherokees, and, at the head of a great State, enforced a lasting peace upon the border. But this, and the subsequent career of Robertson, I shall have to recount in another volume."], [197, "CHAPTER IX. THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. Now, for more than a year, peace prevailed along the entire Western frontier. George Rogers Clark, soon after the fall of Vincennes, captured the British posts on the Wabash and in the Illinois country, and this, with the continued captivity of Governor Hamilton, prevented any further attempt at a coalition of the Northern Indians. The Southern tribes had been ren dered powerless, for the time, by the loss of their am munition at Chickamauga ; and, moreover, their most enterprising chieftain, Dragging Canoe, could not move until he had planted and harvested a crop of corn to carry his people through the winter. This condition of things being speedily known east of the mountains, it induced a fresh tide of emigra tion from the seaboard, which soon added materially to the strength of Sevier and his backwoodsmen. During the entire summer and autumn of 1779 every road and every mountain trace leading into the new terri tory was crowded with hardy adventurers, seeking homes beyond the reach of the red-coated soldiery of King George. On the frontier they might be exposed to the"], [198, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 178 inroads of the savages ; but this danger they could meet if led by Sevier, the fame of whose exploits had already traveled far beyond the mountains. To the Indians his name had become a terror, but to the settlers it was a pledge of good order and security. Thus was the fame of one man largely instrumental in building up a great commonwealth. Early in 1779 the British had overrun the larger part of Georgia. Defeating General Ashe at Brier Creek, they projected an expedition against Charleston, but were repulsed at Stono Ferry, and driven back to Sa vannah, where, in October, they were besieged by a force under General Lincoln. The attack failed, and the Americans were forced to retreat, with the loss, among others, of the brave Count Pulaski. This closed the campaign of 1779, and Sir Henry Clinton prepared for another and stronger effort for the reduction of the Carolinas. He determined that both front and rear should be again infolded in the coil of the anaconda; and, if the rear attack should fail, the front should be made in such force as to render it irresistible. Accordingly, after enjoying his Christmas dinner in New York, the British commander on the following day went on board the fleet of Admiral Arbuthnot, and set sail, with seventy-five hundred men, for Charleston. He was soon followed by Lord Rawdon, with an addi tional body of twenty-five hundred, and on the 11th of February the combined forces were landed on John's Island, in the vicinity of Charleston. The city made"], [199, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 179 a stubborn defense, but on the 12th of May General Lincoln was obliged to capitulate with his entire army. The fall of Charleston decided the fate of South Carolina ; but, to make sure of its complete subjugation, and as a step in the northward march of his army, Clinton dispatched three expeditions into the interior. One of these, under Lieutenant-Colonel Browne, was to reoccupy Augusta, open communications with the South ern Indians, and supply them with arms and ammuni tion for another rising ; another, under Lieutenant-Colo nel Cruger, was to overrun and subdue the country around Ninety-six ; and the third, a larger force, under Lord Cornwallis, was to march directly northward and disperse some bodies of patriots who were understood to be gathering on the borders of North Carolina. This done, the three bodies were to unite and carry the war into North Carolina and Virginia ; and it was hoped that a junction would be formed with the army in New York, and the whole country south of the Hudson be subjugated, before the close of the campaign. Such was the brilliant dream of Sir Henry Clinton, which, had it come to pass, would have changed the fate of the Amer ican Continent. But, like his previous dream, it was to be rudely dispelled, and by the same means \u2014 the sharp rifle-crack of a few hardy backwoodsmen. A rapid conquest of the whole of South Carolina, from the sea-coast to the mountains, was the result of these expeditions. The march of the British was an un interrupted triumph. Everywhere the people submitted,"], [200, "180 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. took British \"protections,\" or were paroled as prisoners. The country was full of Tories, who now flocked to the royal standard in great numbers, augmenting at their every step the strength of the British forces. A few small bodies of patriots remained in arms after the fall of Charleston ; but these were soon cut to pieces, or driven across the line into North Carolina, where, hid ing in swamps and forests, they hoped to recruit suffi cient strength to be able to harass the outskirts of the advancing enemy. Among these last were Sumter and Marion, who had already acquired fame as partisan sol diers. In less than a month from the fall of Charles ton the only organized force of patriots within the limits of South Carolina were a few hundred mounted militia, who had their headquarters at the Cherokee Ford of Broad River. They were principally North Carolinians, under the command of Colonel Charles McDowell, of Quaker Meadows, in Burke County ; but with them were about a hundred Georgians, under the indomitable Eli jah Clarke, and about thirty South Carolinians, under the brave Colonel James Williams, whose plantation, in the district of Ninety-six, was soon occupied by the British commander, Ferguson, as his headquarters. Thus the whole of Georgia and South Carolina lay prostrate at the feet of the invader. So complete was the subjugation of the two colonies, that they were re garded, and spoken of, by the patriots in Virginia as \" the lost provinces.\" * Seeing the success of the various * Lee's \" Memoirs,\" vol. i."], [201, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 181 British movements, and deeming that there was now no obstacle to the full success of his wide-sweeping plan for the subjugation of the entire country, Sir Henry Clinton, on the 5th of June, embarked for New York, leaving to Lord Cornwallis the task of carrying the war into North Carolina, and thence, through Virginia, northward. At this time strong detachments of British held Augusta and Ninety-six, and a larger force, under Lord Rawdon, had advanced as far north as Camden. But the heats of July and August are unfavorable to the movement of troops upon the seaboard of the Carolinas, and Cornwallis decided to suspend his north ward march until the autumn months, when the har vests should have been gathered, and he could sus tain his army at a distance from his base of supplies at Charleston. In the mean time he would send forward to Augusta arms and ammunition, to equip the Creeks and Cherokees for the intended rising ; and dispatch a competent officer into the back country, to recruit and embody the loyalists who occupied the mountain region and the district along the base of the Alleghanies. Already a body of eight hundred, under a Colonel Bry an, had joined the British forces, and another was be ing organized by Colonel Patrick Moore, a noted Tory, on the borders of North Carolina. Among these mountain people were many of respect able character, well-to-do, peaceable, and order-loving ; but much the larger number then, as now, were of a very \" low-down \" description. They were mostly de-"], [202, "182 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. scended from the more worthless of the poor white set tlers, who, driven back from the seaboard, had herded among these wooded hills with the hordes of horse thieves and criminals who had escaped from justice in the older settlements. The progeny of these people are even at this day a foul blot on American civilization. The women are coarse and destitute of both intelligence and virtue, and the men rough, brutal in their instincts, and of no civilized use except as food for gunpowder. Trained and well led, however, they make good soldiers. And what these people are now they were in the time of the Revolution. Major Hanger, an officer under Cornwallis, who was on recruiting service among them, says : \"In the back parts of Carolina you may search after an angel with as much chance of finding one as [of finding] a parson. In my time you might travel sixty or seventy miles and not see a church, or even a schism-shop meeting-house. I have often called at a log house in the woods, inhabited by eight or ten persons ; and merely from curiosity, have asked the master of the house, ' Pray, my friend, of what religion are you ? ' ' Of what religion, sir ? ' ' Yes, my friend, of what relig ion are you ? \u2014 or, to what sect do you belong ? ' ' Oh ! now I understand you ; why, for the matter of that, religion does not trouble us much in these parts.' This race of men,\" Hanger continues, \"are more sav age than the Indians, and possess every one of their vices, but not one of their virtues. I have known one of them to travel two hundred miles through the woods,"], [203, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 183 never keeping any road or path, guided by the sun by day and the stars by night, to kill a particular person belonging to the opposite party. He would shoot him before his own door, and ride away, to boast of what he had done on his return. I speak only of backwoods men, not of the inhabitants in general of South Caro lina, for, in all America, there are not better-educated or better-bred men than the planters.\"* These people were the natural enemies of the re spectable classes, who were generally patriots ; and from among them Cornwallis expected to draw a large body of recruits to his army. To this end, on the 18th of May, only six days after the capitulation of Charleston, he dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Ferguson to raise the royal standard in the border coun ties. This gentleman was one of the most active and enterprising officers in the British service. Intrepid and determined, he was yet of genial manners, and open to the better impulses of humanity ; and also possessed of a personal magnetism that gave him a strong ascend ency over his own men and the country-people. En tering the army at an early age, he had secured a large experience in war, and was universally regarded as one of the most able and accomplished of the British com manders. He had acquired such skill in the use of the rifle that he was considered, by his fellow-soldiers, the best marksman living ; and he had invented a weapon to be loaded at the breech, which he could fire, with * Hanger's \" Life and Opinions,\" vol. ii, pp. 403-405."], [204, "184 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. wonderful precision, seven times in a minute. It was his own opinion that Washington had been at the mercy of this unerring rifle just before the battle of Brandywine. In a letter to his relative, Dr. Adam Ferguson, the emi nent Scottish historian and philosopher, he relates the incident as follows : \" A rebel officer, remarkable by a hussar dress, passed toward our army, within a hun dred yards of my right flank, not perceiving us. He was followed by another, dressed in dark green and blue, mounted on a bay horse, with a remarkably high cocked hat. I ordered three good shots to steal near to and fire at them ; but the idea disgusting me, I recalled the order. The hussar, in returning, made a circuit, but the other passed within a hundred yards of us, upon which I advanced from the wood toward him. Upon my calling, he stopped ; but, after looking at me, he proceeded. I again drew his attention, and made signs to him to stop, leveling my piece at him ; but he slowly cantered away. As I was within that distance at which, in the quickest firing, I could have lodged half a dozen balls in and about him before he was out of my reach, I had only to determine ; but it was not pleasant to fire at the back of an unoffending individ ual, who was acquitting himself very coolly of his duty, so I let him alone.\" On the following day Ferguson learned, from some patriot officers he had captured, that Washington had been all that morning in the position indicated, dressed in every point as above described, and attended by only"], [205, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 185 a French officer in hussar uniform. He adds, \" I am not sorry I did not know at the time who it was.\" On such slight events often hang the fate of nations. Whether this was or was not Washington, there can be but one opinion of the humanity of Ferguson. Ferguson set out at once for Ninety-six, with a body of a hundred and fifty or two hundred picked regulars, and there established a camp of instruction, to which flocked all the Tories of the region. \"His camp,\" says an old historian,* \"became at once the rendezvous of the desperate, the idle and vindictive, as well as of the youth of the loyalists whose zeal or ambition prompted them to military service. There was a part of South Carolina which had not yet been trodden by a hostile foot, and the projected march through this unexplored and as yet undevastated region drew many to the stand ard of Ferguson. This was the country which stretches along the foot of the mountains toward the borders of North Carolina. The progress of the British commander and his unnatural confederates was marked with blood and lighted up with conflagrations.\" By the middle of June, Ferguson's army numbered over two thousand, and then, drilling his men as he marched, he moved gradually northward. Then, Mc- Dowell, seeing that his native State would soon be in vaded by a force greatly superior to his own, sent ur gent dispatches over the mountains, asking immediate aid of Sevier and Shelby. This led to the rear-guard * Johnson."], [206, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 186 being advanced to the front, and to the \"tall Watauga boys\" being brought again into action. They were in daily expectation of an attack from the Cherokees ; they knew that South Carolina was overrun by an irre sistible force, and they might be marching to a swift destruction ; but they did not hesitate to become the forlorn hope, as they had, all along, been the rear-guard, of the Revolution. In the early days of July they joined McDowell, four hundred strong, at the Cherokee Ford of Broad River, in South Carolina. Two hundred of them were from the upper part of Washington District, which had been erected into the new county of Sulli van, and placed under Isaac Shelby as colonel ; the re mainder were from directly around Watauga, and under the immediate command of Major Charles Robertson \u2014 it not being deemed prudent for Sevier to leave on so distant an expedition in view of the threatening atti tude of the Indians. The principal command, there fore, devolved upon Shelby. Even with this re-enforcement, McDowell's force numbered less than a thousand men, and was far too weak to cope with Ferguson. He, consequently, pur sued a sort of guerrilla warfare \u2014 hanging upon the flanks of the British, and intercepting and cutting off such small parties as were intending to join them. This was just the service to call into exercise the tire less energy and activity of Shelby and the over-mount ain men. Marching by night, and sleeping or fighting by day, they were ever on the move, and during the"], [207, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 187 little more than thirty days that they remained with McDowell they gained no less than three important victories \u2014 not important in themselves, but in their re sults ; for they were the first small links in the chain of events that forced Cornwallis, only fourteen months later, to surrender at Yorktown. McDowell was a good and brave soldier, and a most enthusiastic patriot, but he was altogether too slow and methodical of movement to cope with so active an ad versary as Ferguson. Indeed, the British commander seems to have paid him very little attention. With the exception of a few slight skirmishes, no collision oc curred between the opposing forces until Shelby's ar rival on the Broad River. But Shelby was there not to look idly on while the British devastated the country; not to parry blows, but to give them \u2014 to attack, and not to defend, and to attack according to the whirl wind tactics he had learned of Sevier over the mount ains. He had not been two days with McDowell, when Ferguson became aware of the fact that a new moving force had taken possession of the Americans. About twenty miles from McDowell's camp, and at about the same distance from Ferguson's, was Thicketty Fort, a strong redoubt, which had been erected four years before, during a war with the Indians. Of this fort the Tory colonel, Patrick Moore, had taken posses sion, and he was here gathering and drilling a body of loyalists, with whom to join Ferguson. He was supplied with a British sergeant-major to discipline his recruits ;"], [208, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 188 but he gave them actual exercise in the art of war by plundering the defenseless women and children who had been left behind in their homes by the patriots. He stripped them of everything they had to eat and to wear, often leaving them not a measure of meal, nor an ounce of salt to season their porridge. Before Shelby had been twenty-four hours with McDowell he set out at sunset, with his own four hundred mounted riflemen, and an additional two hundred under Colonel Elijah Clarke to put an end to Moore's marauding. He sur rounded the fort just at break of day, and summoned it to surrender. Its only entrance was a small wicket, and it was inclosed by a strong abattis, and defended by ninety-four men, with two hundred and fifty stand of arms, loaded with ball and buck-shot, and so placed at the port-holes that the garrison could easily have repulsed a force twice as strong as that of the assail ants. But at a second summons, without firing a shot, Moore surrendered. The news soon traveled to Ferguson, who at once de tached one of his best officers, Major Dunlap, with eight hundred men, to pursue and bring Shelby to battle, while he should follow more leisurely in the rear, to aid in any decisive engagement. After considerable march ing and counter-marching, Dunlap and Shelby came to gether not far from Spartanburg, one morning in early August. Shelby had gone into camp on Fair Forest Creek, about two miles from Cedar Spring, to refresh, with a night's rest, his tired men and horses. As usual,"], [209, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 189 he had sent out trusty scouts to scour the country in all directions, and the day before had let a new recruit, named Josiah Culbertson, visit his home, which was in the neighborhood. After passing the night with his friends, Culbertson rose before day and rode rapidly to the previous encampment of Shelby. Every man in it was astir, loading his gun or saddling his horse, in preparation for an immediate movement ; but, to the surprise of the young American, they all wore the Brit ish uniform ! They were too much absorbed in their occupations to particularly notice him ; and coolly turn ing his horse's head, he rode slowly away from the en campment. When once out of sight he thrust spurs into his animal, and flew away on the route he sup posed Shelby to have taken. He soon found him drawn up on favorable ground and in readiness for battle. The scouts had reported the near neighborhood of the British, but from Culbertson Shelby received an accu rate description of their forces. I need not describe the battle. It was a fierce hand to-hand struggle, with sabers and pistols and the butt ends of rifles, each man singling out his enemy, and in some instances engaging more than one, owing to the superior numbers of the British. Clarke showed un common bravery and prowess. Shelby relates that in the very midst of the fight he had to pause to witness his unequal contest with two stalwart Britons. One had given him a saber-blow upon the head, the other a thrust in the neck, which, but for his stock-buckle, would"], [210, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 190 have ended his life ; and then a heavy saber-stroke forced his sword from his hand, and he was a prisoner. But he was so for but a moment. Disarmed, and in the grasp of two men, each as strong as he, he suddenly felled one to the ground and sent the other into a rapid retreat. This sort of fighting lasted for half an hour, when Dunlap drew off his men, with a loss of between twenty and thirty in killed and wounded, and leaving in Shelby's hands twenty prisoners, two of whom were British officers. Shelby had only four or five killed and two badly wounded. Dunlap had fled scarcely two miles from the battle ground, when he was met by Ferguson with his whole army. It was now Shelby's turn to retreat, for he was confronted by four or five times his own number, led by one of the ablest officers of the British army. Gath ering his prisoners and wounded together \u2014 all but the two, who were too badly hurt to be moved \u2014 he took the direction of McDowell's camp on Broad River. Forming frequently on advantageous ground, he re tarded the pursuit till, when about five miles away, he came to a rocky hill which lay directly across the road way. The hill was about sixty feet high, and so steep that in some places the men were obliged to dismount and help their horses up the ascent. The position was not unlike that chosen by Ferguson at King's Mount ain, which General Bernard, one of the ablest of Napo leon's engineers, pronounced capable of defense against any body of disciplined troops attacking in a regular"], [211, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 191 manner. Here Shelby and Clarke formed their columns and awaited the enemy. When Ferguson came up they taunted him to attack them ; but, deeming the position impregnable, he forbore an assault, abandoned the pur suit, and left Shelby to ride leisurely off to a junction with McDowell. But the taunts of these raw provin cial officers rankled in the breast of Ferguson, and in fluenced him subsequently to acts which had disastrous consequences. These two conflicts were the first rumbling of the storm that was to overwhelm Cornwallis ; but they had no immediate results beyond inspiriting the patriots by an exhibition of what brave and determined men can do, when battling against great odds, for their country. McDowell had moved his camp to a place called Smith's Ford, about twenty miles lower down Broad River. Ferguson lay twenty-six miles to the southwest of him ; and fourteen miles beyond Ferguson, at Mus grove's Mills, on the south bank of the Enoree River, was an intrenched camp of, as variously stated, from two to four hundred Tories. It was deemed important to capt ure these Tories; but the enterprise would be a most hazardous one, for Ferguson lay directly between the patriots and their object, and at not more than two hours' distance from Musgrove's. However, after a few days' rest, Shelby and Clarke again mounted their horses and set out on this expedition. With them went a number of officers as volunteers, among whom were Major Joseph McDowell, brother of the colonel ; Captain"], [212, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 192 Valentine Sevier, brother of John Sevier ; and Colonels James Williams and Thomas Brandon, the last two resi dents of the district and familiar with its every by path. At that very time Ferguson was encamped on Brandon's plantation. The troops set out from Smith's Ford about an hour before sunset, on the 18th of August, two days subse quent to the battle of Camden, of which great disaster they were as yet in ignorance. They kept to the woods until after dark, and then took a road which passed some three or four miles to the west of Ferguson's encamp ment. It was a hard ride of forty miles, most of the way upon a gallop, but at the dawn of day they were within half a mile of the enemy. Here they sent out a small party of scouts to reconnoitre, and, while awaiting their return, encountered a countryman who told them that the Tories had been re-enforced during the previous night by six hundred regular troops, under a Colonel Ennes, of the British army. With them were Captain Abraham De Peyster, second in command to Ferguson ; Captain David Fanning, a noted loyalist partisan ; Major Fraser, of the regular army, and other skillful officers. Hastily the patriot leaders gathered together for con sultation. Beyond a doubt the information was cor rect \u2014 it was too much in detail to be otherwise ; but what should be done in the circumstances ? To attack a well-posted body of regular troops of nearly twice their number would be sheer madness ; but to attempt a retreat, their horses broken down by a hard ride of"], [213, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 193 forty miles, was impossible. While consulting together, they heard a sharp firing at a short distance. It was the scouts, who had encountered a patrol of the enemy, killing one and wounding two, and sending the rest in precipitate flight to the British camp. Soon the scouts came in, reporting this skirmish, and then it became certain that the British would soon know that the Americans were in the vicinity, and would sally out to attack them. Thus, there was now no alternative \u2014 they must stand their ground and encounter greatly superior numbers. They threw up a hasty breastwork of brush and de cayed logs, and formed in a semicircular line across the road, which here climbed a ridge, thickly overgrown with trees and underbrush, which would effectually con ceal them from the enemy. In the space of thirty min utes they were in readiness for attack, strongly posted behind a breast-high intrenchment. Then Shelby sent forward Captain Shadrach Iuman, who had served brave ly against the British and Tories in Georgia, with twen ty-five mounted men, to lure the enemy on, and tempt them to cross the river. The ruse worked admirably. Plunging into the stream, the British came on with charged bayonets, Captain Inman falling slowly back, and keeping up a show of fighting. At last, when the British were within seventy yards of the concealed breastwork, Inman and his men scattered into the woods along the road-side, and then from behind the breast work the Americans poured a destructive volley into the 9"], [214, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 194 ranks of the advancing enemy. The orders of Shelby were, \" Don't fire till you see the whites of the Tories' eyes ! \" or, as by another account, \" Till you can count the buttons on their coats ! \" and in the hands of those unerring marksmen every rifle did bloody execution. For half an hour the firing continued ; and then Will iam Smith, of Watauga, shouted, \"I've killed their commander ! \" and about the same instant young Rob ert Bean, the son of William Bean, the first settler, ex claimed that he had unhorsed Major Fraser, the second in command. Then Shelby raised the famous Tennes see yell, and rushed out with his men upon the enemy. The British bravely contested the ground for a short distance, falling slowly back, but soon their retreat be came a rout, and they fled down the road, through the woods, and over the hills to the river. With reckless speed they rushed to the ford, through which they plunged in the wildest confusion, hotly pursued by the victorious backwoodsmen. Sixty-three were killed, ninety wounded, and seventy taken prisoners. Of the Ameri cans only four were killed and eight or nine wounded ; but among the killed was the brave Inman, who had contributed so largely to the success of the battle. The disparity in the losses was owing to the fatal aim of the Watauga riflemen, and to their being shielded, during most of the fight, by the hastily constructed breast work. According to their custom, the over-mountain men had dismounted to fight the battle. Their horses were"], [215, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 195 tethered in a dense wood in the rear, out of range of the firing ; and now, the British having fled across the Enoree, every man sprang into his saddle to give a more rapid pursuit to the enemy. While this was being done, Shelby, Clarke, Brandon, and Williams came together, as if by instinct, for a hurried consultation. It was the one wish of the last two mentioned to free their home district from the presence of the enemy. Ninety-six was but twenty miles away. They could be there by sun set, and, taken by surprise, Cruger would have no alter native but surrender. Ninety-six taken, Augusta was only fifty miles farther away, and there Cornwallis had accumulated a vast amount of warlike stores to arm the Creeks and Cherokees. The fort there was defended by Colonel Browne with only a hundred and fifty Brit ish regulars. It could be quickly carried by assault, and, the arms and ammunition it contained being capt ured, there would be hope of another interval of peace to the settlements beyond the mountains. Shelby was rapid in decision as well as fertile in re source. He saw the great advantages that might result from the movement, and instantly he resolved upon the expedition. He was about to give the order to march, when a horseman rode up in hot haste to the little group of officers. He was covered with the foam and dust of nearly fifty miles of hard riding. He handed a letter to Shelby from McDowell, which inclosed one addressed to the latter from Governor Caswell, of North Carolina. This last was dated from the battle-field of Camden, and"], [216, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 196 apprised McDowell of the great disaster. The army, which had been so long gathering under Gates and De Kalb to stay the northward march of Cornwallis, had been utterly routed, and its broken fragments were then fleeing in all directions, not to pause in their flight till a hundred and fifty miles lay between them and the field of battle. \"The enemy will no doubt,\" added the Gov ernor, \"endeavor to improve his victory by cutting up all the small corps of Americans; therefore, let every separate detachment get out of the way as quickly as possible.\" Being questioned, the messenger said that McDowell was already moving toward Gilbert Town, a small hamlet at the base of the mountains in North Carolina. There was no room to question the information, for Shelby was familiar with the handwriting of the Gov ernor. He had corresponded with him, and his signa ture was affixed to his own commission as colonel. Therefore, he accepted the truth, and with lightning glance his quick mind took in the situation. He saw that all was lost east of the mountains ; that from the Potomac to Southern Georgia the British rode trium phant, and, except in forests and morasses, there was nowhere a hiding-place for a patriot.

Such was the quick re solve of this man of iron \u2014 iron fused now into steel by the fiery trial through which his country was passing. He ordered the seventy prisoners to be mounted behind as many of his troops, and then, with one wave of his hand, he said, \"Now, boys, to the mountains !\" There was need of haste, for already the fugitives from the battle were half-way to Ferguson's encampment, and, before another hour, he would be in rapid pursuit with fresh men and horses. Shelby's horses were jaded, his men exhausted by fifteen hours of constant marching and fighting ; but no sooner was the word given, than they were on their way, straight as the bird flies, for the Alleghanies. All that August day, all that sultry night, and all the following day they marched, never once drawing rein till they were sixty miles away in the mountain-region. The horses nibbled the corn-stalks that stood in the fields through which they were pass ing, and the men ate the raw ears and a few peaches that grew along the road-side. At last they halted, after forty-eight hours of such fatigue as men seldom endure, and then scarcely one among them could recognize his most intimate acquaintance. The faces of all were so bloated, their eyes so swollen, as to have altogether lost their characteristic appearance. As Shelby had expected, they were pursued by a strong force of Ferguson's mounted men, who followed their trail till the close of the day of the battle. Then, only thirty minutes behind the retreating patriots, the British went into camp, too"], [218, "198 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. much exhausted with the intense heat to proceed farther. Thus was the right wing of the rear-guard trained by both victory and defeat to do far more effectual battle for its country. And now the brave little army broke into pieces. Shelby and his men took the Indian trail over the mountains to Watauga ; Williams, with a sufficient guard, set out by unfrequented ways to a safe asylum with the prisoners; hut Clarke, with but a hundred men, faced south, right into the British lines, deter mined to capture Augusta. His State was trampled underfoot, his wife and children were homeless, and he himself was an outlaw with a price upon his head ; but to this indomitable man all was not lost so long as he could wield a sword or carry a musket. He crept slowly along the base of the mountains, gathering strength as he went, and, in the early days of September, with seven hundred men, swooped down upon Augusta. Browne he cooped up in the fort without food or water ; a large body of Cherokees, who were there for arms and ammu nition, he scattered to the four winds ; and the prize was all but in his grasp, when Cruger with a strong force from Ninety-six came upon him, and he was forced to retreat to the mountains. The word went that he was fleeing north, and, to capture him, Ferguson delayed a junction with Cornwallis long enough to enable the over-mountain men to come up with him at King's Mountain. Had Clarke not been a fugitive, that turn ing battle of the Revolution would not have been fought,"], [219, "THE REAR-GUARD AT THE FRONT. 199 nor Cornwallis been checked in his victorious march northward. Thus, reading history at the end of a cent ury, we see that disaster is sometimes a necessary prelude to victory. But these devoted men did not see events as we see them. To them this was the darkest hour of the Revo lution. Even Washington, writing to Steuben, said, \" The prospect is gloomy, and the storm threatens \" ; and to General Reed, \"I have almost ceased to hope.\" But the darkness is deepest just before the dawn, and even now, amid this intense gloom, a cloud is gathering far away upon the Alleghanies \u2014 a cloud no larger than a man's hand, but which is forging the lightning-bolt that shall rend in pieces the British power in the colo nies.

THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. But, while gloom overspreads the seaboard, there are feasting and jollity beyond the Alleghanies. The In dians are still upon their good behavior. They have not yet been furnished with their full supply of powder, and, until they are, Oconostota will not move, for on this occasion he intends to make sure of driving the set tlers far east of the mountains ; and Cornwallis designs that he shall penetrate into Southwest Virginia as far as the present town of Wytheville, and seize there the Chiswell lead-mines, which are the sole source of sup ply for the border patriots. So the Indian king waits in grim impatience the arrival of the arms and ammunition which Clarke will soon have so nearly in his grasp at Augusta. But the Chickamaugas are restless. With ten grains of powder in their pouches they can not keep still ; so, a small body ventures upon an insignificant raid against the settlement at the mouth of Flat Creek, on the Nolichucky. They are easily repulsed by Major Jonathan Tipton, who is second in command to Sevier, while Charles Robertson is absent in South Carolina. Having, therefore, nothing to do, Sevier occupies his"], [221, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 201 leisure by getting up, for the 14th of August, a grand celebration at his rambling log-palace on the Nolichucky. It is such a celebration as occurs to most men only once in a lifetime ; but to Sevier it comes twice, for he is an exceptional man, not to be confined to the limits, nor judged by the rules, which are applied to the ordinary run of humanity. To it he invites all his friends \u2014 which term with him includes every man, woman, and child in the territory. And from far and near they come, a greater gathering than ever yet was seen west of the Alleghanies. They overflow the spacious dwelling, and gather in joyous groups about the green lawn that slopes down to the rapid Nolichucky. Here, under the old wide-spreading trees, are long tables that will seat several thousands, and near by a couple of huge oxen, split from head to tail, are roasting upon large gridirons over char coal-fires. For this is a genuine backwoods barbecue, at which cider and apple-jack will flow freely, and there will be feasting and dancing till the stars grow pale upon the mountains. But, before these exercises begin, there is a short ceremony to be witnessed in the spacious drawing-room. Here is Nolichucky Jack, divested of hunting-shirt, and clad, \" for this occasion only,\" in the uniform of a Con tinental colonel ; and by his side is a tall, queenly-look ing woman, superbly dressed \u2014 for the backwoods. Their hands are clasped together, and before them stands the grave Parson Doak, his head crowned with an unsightly skull-cap, but with a smile upon his face which, merely"], [222, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 202 to look at, is a benediction. He was one of those men who seem sent into the world to give ocular proof of the life of serene loveliness that lies above us. He asks the couple a few questions, and says over them a few words, and then they are man and wife \u2014 Nolichucky Jack aud the \"bonnie Kate\" who four years before leaped into his arms over the high stockade at Watauga. Henceforth she is to be a mother to his manly boys, and for thirty five years she will nerve his soul to such struggles as come to only a few men in a century. In and of him self Nolichucky Jack was a hero, but, without the devo tion of this noble woman, he might not always have been able to stand so erect as he did amid the treachery of friends and the constant onslaughts of his savage ene mies. The wedding viands were scarcely cold, when a body of horsemen wound down the mountain-side and came to a halt in the court-yard of Sevier's mansion. They were war-worn and weather-beaten. Their hunting-shirts were smeared with mud and stained with blood, and the bandaged limbs of some of them showed that they had received as well as given blows in some deadly encount ers. Sevier came out to meet them ; and, as soon as they caught sight of his manly form in the doorway, they set up the Tennessee yell which he was the first to introduce into Southern warfare. Greeting and hand-shaking followed, and Sevier had a kindly word of recognition for every one of them \u2014 for all had been there before, and at free quarters. And here I may as well say that, while North"], [223, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 203 Carolina enrolled the men and commissioned the officers, she never paid one of her over-mountain soldiers a dollar. They fed and equipped themselves, and those not able to do this were furnished with outfit and supplies by the more wealthy among them. Sevier was a man of large wealth for the times, and he kept open house to all comers. His dwelling was the usual rendezvous on occa sions of alarm, aud hence he often had hundreds of his soldiery quartered for days upon him. Every man was at home in his house, and this seemed entirely natural, inasmuch as Sevier was so open-handed that all that he had, and he himself, came to be regarded as the common property of the community. From Shelby Sevier received his first accurate ac count of affairs upon the seaboard ; for in those times news passed by word of mouth in the backwoods, and was not always to be entirely relied upon. Sevier recog nized fully the gravity of the situation ; but he was more hopeful, though not less determined, than his younger compatriot. He did not believe that the country could be wholly subjugated. There is that, he thought, in the Anglo-Saxon which prefers death to submission to a ruler not of his own selection. This was the choice which he and his men had taken. They should con test their mountain-passes foot by foot, and if at last they were overrun by irresistible numbers, and death upon the battle-field was denied them, those that re mained alive would take water down the Tennessee and Mississippi, and find more peaceful graves among the"], [224, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 204 Spaniards of Louisiana. Let come what might come, they would not live under the British Government. But this alternative would not be presented. If the sea board should submit, the mountains would be free. For more than ten years the men of Watauga had stood alone, battling at times with odds that were twenty to one against them. And they had been but a hand ful, while now they counted nearly a thousand rifles. Among those mountain fastnesses that single thousand was a match for ten thousand British, and that was more than Cornwallis had in his armies. Therefore Sevier bade Shelby to be of good cheer; for they never had been, and never would be, beaten. This was the natural language of Sevier's intrepid soul ; and, in thus estimating his own prowess, he reck oned solely upon his own sword and the steady aim of his unerring rifles. As yet he took no account, as did Robertson, of those invisible forces that do battle for the right \u2014 the horses and chariots of fire that the young man saw encamped round about Elisha. The over-mountain men dispersed to their homes, and Shelby rode on to his cattle-ranch at King's Mead ows. But he did not remain there long. In the last days of August there came to him one Samuel Philips, a distant relative, with a message from the British com mander, Ferguson, who had advanced to the eastern base of the mountains in rapid pursuit of McDowell. Phil ips was probably one of Shelby's men who had been wounded, and left behind after the battle at Musgrove's"], [225, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 205 Mill. Taken prisoner by Ferguson, he had been hu manely treated, then paroled, and sent forward to Shelby, with word that, if he and the others did not \"desist from their opposition to the British arms, he would march his army over the mountains, hang the leaders, and lay the country waste with fire and sword.\" Fer guson was then only sixty miles south of Watauga, and still moving northward after McDowell. In his army were a number of Tories who had been driven out from Watauga, and one whom Robert Sevier's horsemen had subjected to a coat of tar and feathers during the previous summer. These men were well acquainted with the border settlements aud the mountain-passes, and now, their natural antagonism inflamed by bitter resentment, they proposed to guide Ferguson to an easy conquest of the over-mountain region. It is possible that Ferguson intended to attempt the execution of this threat, for the Watauga and Back water districts were the only ones south of Virginia that did not now recognize the kingly authority ; and, besides, they were on the direct road to the Chiswell lead-mines, the capture of which he must have known was deemed a capital object by Cornwallis. But, how ever this may have been, his idle words were prolific of grave results ; to borrow the phrase of Robertson, \"Never was threat so impotent and yet so powerful.\" Their first result was to put Shelby upon horseback for a ride of forty miles to the house of Sevier, on the Nolichucky. Sevier was not at home, but twenty miles"], [226, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 206 away, attending a horse-race at the new county-seat, Jonesboro\u2014 for, even in these soul-trying times, Noli chucky Jack could think of whatever was likely to im prove that important component of his little army, the fleet racer. Again Shelby mounted his horse, and in a few hours had repeated to Sevier the message he had received from Ferguson. The details of this important interview, and which of the two men first proposed the heroic enterprise of which it was the inception, can not be positively stated. I am not aware that Sevier was ever known to speak of it ; and, if he did, his love of Shelby, and modest reti cence in regard to his own achievements, would most likely have led him to attribute the larger credit to his younger compatriot. But a careful consideration of what has been written by Shelby, and what is known of Sevier, leads to the conclusion that the idea of the expe dition originated with the soldier, all whose tactics were comprised in the one word, attack \u2014 sudden, sharp, vig orous, and in the enemy's country. Writing about the battle of King's Mountain, in 1823, Shelby said : \" I went fifty or sixty miles to see Colonel Sevier, who was the efficient commander of Washington County, North Caro lina, to inform him of the message I had received, and to concert with him measures for our defense. After some consultation, we determined to march with all the men we could raise, and attempt to surprise Ferguson by attacking him in his camp, or at any rate before he was prepared for us. We accordingly appointed a time"], [227, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 207 and place of rendezvous.\" The words that I have itali cized show clearly that Shelby had no thought of attack until he met Sevier, with whom, I therefore conclude, the whole plan of the expedition originated. Ferguson had bearded the lion in his lair. From the nature of the man it was inevitable that he should spring from his covert, pounce down upon the boastful Briton and destroy him. The result of this interview Governor Shelby relates as follows : \"It was known to us that some two or three hundred of the militia who had been under the com mand of Colonel McDowell, and were driven by the suc cess of the enemy from the lower country, were then on the Western waters, and mostly in the county of Wash ington, North Carolina. I saw some of their officers before we parted ; Colonel Sevier engaged to give notice to these refugees, and to bring them into our measure. On my part, I undertook to procure the aid and co-oper ation of Colonel William Campbell, of Washington Coun ty, Virginia, and the men of that county, if practicable.\" For two whole days these two men conferred to gether, and the Fates were busy while they talked with each other in that rude log mansion on the Noli chucky. For this was a pivotal event, and on their decision hung, perhaps, the course of centuries. What passed between them is not known, but I can imagine it ; for once, at a like pivotal period, I sat by while Chase and Lincoln discussed measures on which depended the fate of this nation. As they weighed one course against"], [228, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 208 another, scanned the present, and tried to forecast the future, the great curtain seemed to uproll before me, and disclose to my view those hidden forces which control our human destiny. For we are but puppets, moved at the will of higher powers \u2014 powers that are of good, and so, however deep the gloom, we may take heart and have courage. If my view of these two men be correct, it was Shel by who proposed to act on the defensive \u2014 to guard the mountain-passes, and hang upon Ferguson's flank and rear, and thus decimate and finally destroy him. But, if this were done, who would manage the latent Tories among them, and meet the coming onslaught of the Creeks and Cherokees ? Might not the settlers thus be caught between two fires, and be crushed by overwhelm ing numbers ? Would it not be better to cross the mountains, annihilate Ferguson, and then turn upon the Indians ? Thirty days would finish Ferguson, and meanwhile the settlers who should remain at home could be gathered into forts, where they could hold Oconostota at bay until the return of the expedition. Ferguson's army was the left wing of Cornwallis, and that destroyed, or even badly broken, the British general would be forced to fall back upon Charleston, and thus give the patriots time to rally and recover their lost country. This plan, so bold and so comprehensive, was worthy of the genius of Sevier. It was the one adopted ; and a rendezvous was at once appointed for the 25th of Sep tember, at the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga."], [229, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 209 A bolder enterprise is, I think, not recorded in the history of any people. From the Wolf Hills to the Nolichucky they could not, all told, muster a thousand rifles. In their front, not sixty miles away, were gather ing not less than five thousand well-armed savages ; and in their rear, just over the mountains, were hordes of banded Tories, and a well-drilled British army, said to number twenty-five hundred. And yet these men pro posed to divide in the presence of this cloud of enemies, and to hurl only half their force against those British bayonets, across two hundred miles of country, with no supplies, and no arms except their trusty rifles ! Men occasionally do heroic deeds in the stress of desperate circumstances. But the situation of the settlers was by no means desperate. It was no vainglorious boast of Sevier that his one thousand among those mountains would be a match for a British ten thousand ; and his men had too often beaten the Cherokees to fear a raid from Oconostota. An Indian fight had no more terror to them than a hunting-frolic, and it was not near so exciting as a horse-race. What, then, could prompt them to be now the forlorn hope of the country ? Not, surely, pay, for her debts North Carolina paid in prom ises, and her promises had now a market value of only one cent on the dollar ! Not glory, for they knew their names would never be so much as mentioned east of the Alleghanies. It was, and it could have been, noth ing but a pure hatred of oppression, and a pure love for liberty. The spirit was upon them which was upon"], [230, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 210 Gideon when he marshaled his three hundred, and so, though but a handful, they became a host, irresistible and invincible. Shelby gone to carry out his part of the programme, Sevier called his couriers together, to rouse the settle ments and gather up the scattered fragments of McDow ell's army. On fleet horses they go over forest-trails and mountain-paths and traveled roads, and as they go there echoes everywhere the cry: \"The red-coats are coming ! Rally for Chucky Jack and freedom ! \" As words leap upon the electric wire, as fire flashes along a powder-train, so the message sped from mouth to mouth, from hamlet to hamlet, from farm-house to farm house, till the whole territory broke into a blaze of indig nant fire, amid which men grasped their rifles, leaped upon their horses, and hurried away to the rendezvous. The whole country rose, and all \u2014 men and women, beardless youth and gray-haired age \u2014 came together on that September day under those old oaks along the Wa tauga. And then occurred a scene such as never before or since has been witnessed in history. Every man was eager to be led against the enemy ; but all could not go, for a half must remain to guard the settlements. So, that none might have cause of complaint, a draft was re sorted to \u2014 a draft to decide, not who should go, but who should be compelled to stay at home ! Among those not drafted for the home-guard was Joseph, the elder son of Sevier, who, being eighteen, came just within the limit ;"], [231, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 211 but his younger brother, James, was not yet sixteen, and so was shut off from the enrollment. But the boy was bound to go, and, being refused by his father, applied to his young mother to intercede for him. She took him to Sevier and said, \"Here, Mr. Sevier, is another of your boys who wants to go to the war ; but we have no horse for him, and, poor fellow, it is too great a distance for him to walk.\" The horse was got, and the boy went \" to the war,\" and fought like a man at King's Mountain. Horses were scarce, for many had been recently stolen by the Indians, and some of the men, too, were short of necessary equipments. These last could be had for pay from the few stores scattered about the settlements, but Sevier's exchequer was exhausted from frequent drafts of a similar nature, and not a man among his neigh bors had a dollar of any kind of currency. All had expended their ready means in taking up their lands, or in paying taxes to the entry-taker. He \u2014 John Adair \u2014 had all the money in the territory. The expedition seemed about to be retarded, perhaps altogether frus trated, because of Sevier's lack of means to pay for the equipment of his soldiery. Never before did so much hang upon the possession of a small amount of legal cur rency. But in this emergency Sevier bethought him of Adair, and, going to him, suggested that he should loan to him and Shelby whatever moneys he had collected. The following was Adair's answer : \" Colonel Sevier, I have no right to make any such disposition of this money ; it belongs to the impoverished treasury of North"], [232, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 212 Carolina. But, if the country is overrun by the British, liberty is gone. Let the money go too. Take it. If by its use the enemy is driven from the country, I can trust that country to justify and vindicate my conduct. Take it ! \" Sevier took it, and thus his men were fully equipped for the expedition. Years afterward, in examining some papers of Sevier's that had been found in the attic of a deserted house in Knoxville, Dr. Ramsey came upon the following re ceipt, which, as the amount is exactly the same that was loaned by Adair to Sevier, is evidence that the latter re funded the money to North Carolina, the very State for whose defense \u2014 yea, salvation \u2014 it had been expended : \" Rec'd Jan'y 31st, 1782, of Mr. John Adair, Entry taker in the county of Sullivan, twelve thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five dollars, which is placed to his credit on the Treasury books. \"Per Robert Lanier, \"12.735 Dollars. Treas\" Salisbury Dist.\" By the 18th of September the runners had gath ered together one hundred and sixty of McDowell's ref ugee troops, and under Major Joseph McDowell they went into camp at Sycamore Shoals, impatient to be led to the recovery of their homes. Colonel Charles Mc- Dowell had, at the first word from Sevier, hastened over the mountains to learn the whereabout of Ferguson, rouse the patriots, and call to their aid Colonel Cleve land and the rough-riders of Wilkes and Surry Counties."], [233, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 213 Meanwhile Shelby had been mustering his men, and applying for help from Colonel William Campbell, who commanded the militia of the Backwater settlements. He was too much occupied to ride the forty miles to Seven-Mile Ford ; so he sent his brother, Captain Moses Shelby, with a letter to Campbell. The doughty Presby terian had just returned from an expedition, in which he had, with Colonel Cleveland, repulsed a raid of two hun dred Tories on the Chiswell lead-mines, but he sent an swer declining to follow Ferguson, and saying that he had decided to raise all the men he could, and march to the borders of Virginia, to oppose the progress of Corn wallis, who had already advanced his headquarters as far north as the town of Charlotte, North Carolina. Not content with this reply, Shelby sent again to him the same messenger, with a request still more urgent, and at the same time dispatched John Adair to his kinsman Arthur Campbell, the commandant of the county, to represent the vast importance of the expedition. This brought the two Campbells together, and then it was decided that William Campbell should join Sevier and Shelby, with two hundred of the best men in the settle ment. Sending to Colonel Cleveland to join them on the march with as many men as he could muster, Campbell set out at once for Shelby's home at King's Meadows, his men proceeding under Major William Ed monston, by the shorter route of the main-traveled road, which led direct to Watauga. Thus it was that, on the morning of September 25th,"], [234, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 214 eight hundred and forty stalwart over-mountain men, under their bravest leaders, were assembled in camp at Sycamore Shoals, ready to go upon the expedition. Of these, one hundred and sixty were what was left of Mc- Dowell's command, four hundred and eighty were \"tall Watauga boys \" under Sevier and Shelby, and the re mainder were the Backwater Presbyterians led by Will iam Campbell. A finer body of men never were brought together on this planet. They were uniformly tall, sin ewy, and powerful. Bred mostly upon the border, they were inured to hardship and familiar with danger, and they had that passionate love of freedom which, born in our Anglo-Saxon blood, is nowhere more fully fostered and developed than amid the free, unconventional life of the backwoods. Of boundless courage, and every one of them a sharp-shooter, they were more than a match for an equal number of the drilled soldiery of any king in Christendom. They might be cut down, but they could not be beaten. They went into battle to die or to conquer. In their conflicts with the Indians, defeat was certain death ; so their fights were life-and-death strug gles. The result was \u2014 whatever the odds \u2014 always vic tory. Sevier and Shelby, their two greatest leaders, were born generals, and so they were literally invincible. We may at this day thank God that, in this darkest hour of a century, there was left this small band of heroes to rush to the rescue of freedom. As they are arrayed now under the old oaks of that mighty forest, they form a picture for some great scenic"], [235, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 215 painter. Beneath them, in that \"old field opening,\" are the bones of a long-buried race, who, it may be in some far-off age, gathered there to be, like them, led forth to battle, and around them are their mothers and wives and children, and the home-guard of four hundred and eighty who have been drafted to be left behind for their protection. All have come together to witness the going forth of this little band, some of whom they fear will never return ; for all know the strait is desperate that calls to the front this rear-guard of the country. Nearly every man has his trusty horse beside him. They are hardy, powerful animals, strong of limb and fleet of foot, and accoutred now in red and yellow trappings of al most barbaric splendor. The men are arrayed in home spun, with hunting-shirts of buckskin or blue linsey, gayly decorated with fringe and tassels. In their hats, in lieu of plumes, are bucks' tails and sprigs of ever green, and to their backs is strapped a knapsack or a blanket ; while a buckskin wallet, filled with the meal of parched corn, saturated with maple-sirup, dangles from their shoulders. This is the whole of their outfit, but occasionally a skillet may be seen fastened to the pommel of a saddle, in which they will cook the game they may kill on the expedition. Their arms are a stout hunting knife, which each one carries in his girdle, and the long Deckard rifle that now rests against his shoulder. Their march will be hindered by no tents or camp equipage, no baggage or baggage-wagons. Their subsistence will be water from the brooks and the parched corn in their"], [236, "216 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. knapsacks ; their bivouac the spreading trees, with the broad heaven above them. Thus lightly encumbered, they will move like the wind, or rather like some dark, electric cloud, from which, every now and then, leaps forth the lightning. They are good for forty miles a day, and can march and fight for forty-eight hours with out rest or refreshment, as they showed when led by Shelby on the Musgrove's Mill expedition. For among them are those same men and that same leader \u2014 the steel-sinewed youth who, a few years before, turned the tide at Long Island Flats and Point Pleasant. And there, too, is Sevier, who is incarnate victory, who never strikes but he discomfits the enemy. He is the idol of them all \u2014 all love him as if he were their brother \u2014 as, in truth, he is, for his great heart infolds them all. Ardent and impetuous, he is also wary and far-seeing. He moves among them now with a free word for all, and that word is to every man hope and inspiration. His dancing eye is aflame with a wild joy, as if he were al ready rushing on the enemy, and in its gleam his men see a sure presage of victory. There, too, is the red haired Campbell, huge of frame and stern of mien, and a host in the day of battle, and with him are Edmonston and Moore, who stood so like a wall at the battle of the Flats when Shelby's men were forming. But I need not single them out. They all were heroes. While they are gathered there, a shout goes up along the valley and echoes among the wood-crowned hills like the roll of distant thunder. It is Arthur Campbell,"], [237, "THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS. 217 with a re-enforcement of the stalwart Scotch Presby terians of the Backwater. He has thought overnight upon the expedition, and he fears that the eight hun dred and forty will not be enough to grapple with Fer guson. So he issues a second call, and is soon on his way with another two hundred, leaving to himself only one third of his strength to meet the expected onset of the Cherokees. All told, not more than seven hundred men will now be left to guard a hundred miles of front ier, and these are scarcely enough to man the forts and patrol the outlying settlements. But Sevier does not fear. He will be not more than a month away, and at the head of the home-guard will be Arthur Campbell and Charles Robertson. With greetings and consulta tions the day is far spent, and word now goes about among the troops that they are not to march till the morning. So they break into little groups and go into camp for the night in the near-by fort or under the great trees, the men with their wives and children about them. Early in the morning they all come together again on the camping-ground, every man with his horse and his rifle, ready to set out on the expedition. With them now is Parson Doak, the pioneer preacher of the region. With uncovered heads the men gather instinct ively about him, and in earnest tones he asks for them the guidance and protection of the Giver of victory and the God of battles. He adds a few stirring sentences that make the blood leap in their veins, closing with the words, \"Go forth, my brave men \u2014 go forth with 10"], [238, "218 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. the sword of the Lord and of Gideon ! \" With one ac cord they take up the words, and, shouting, \"With the sword of the Lord and of our Gideons ! \" they set out on their perilous march in pursuit of the victorious enemy. Not often on this planet has there gone up such a shout, and not often from its mountain recesses has there issued such a band of heroes to do battle for their country."], [239, "CHAPTER XL THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. Amid the blessings and Godspeed of fathers and mothers, and wives and children, those warriors of the wilderness took their toilsome way up the rocky heights and into the wooded defiles of the Alleghanies. The most of them were on horseback, but a few followed on foot with the long, noiseless tread of the backwoodsman. Their hardy looks, their tall, athletic forms, their many colored costumes and long-barreled rifles gleaming in the new-risen sun made a most imposing spectacle. No drum-beat kept time to their footsteps, but silently and stern they climbed the stony mountain - path, intent upon the grim work that was before them. In single file, or at most two by two, they marched, for the way was narrow \u2014 a mere hunter's trace through the primitive forest. Following the margin of a mountain-brook, they came, at the end of twenty miles, to the bank of Big Doe River, a limpid stream of the purest of water. Here they tethered their horses among the trees, unslung their knapsacks, and went into bivouac for the night. In the morning they were early astir, and, at the dis tance of four miles, came to the base of Roan Mountain,"], [240, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 220 one of the loftiest of the Alleghanies. Leaving it at the south, they ascended a gap called Bright's Trace, and climbed the Yellow Mountain to its summit. Behind them they had left mild September weather, but now they found, says one of their number, \"the sides and top of the mountain covered with snow shoe-mouth deep, and on the summit about a hundred acres of beautiful table-land, in which a spring issued and ran over into the Watauga.\" On this open space the men were drawn up in battalions under their several leaders, and exercised in their various evolutions. On discharg ing their rifles, they could distinguish scarcely any re port, so rare is the atmosphere on this elevated parade ground, nearly a mile above the sea. Here occurred a slight incident that had an important influence upon the expedition. Two of Sevier's men \u2014 James Crawford and Samuel Chambers \u2014 did not answer to their names on this parade, and it was at once surmised that they had deserted to Ferguson. For the hope of a paltry reward they were about to betray their comrades to the enemy. On the usual route were several passes where a hundred men could dispute the progress of a thousand, and, if the deserters made haste, the British might come upon the little army before it had emerged from the mountains. The leaders gathered hastily together, and instantly de cided to change the route of the expedition. At the summit of the Alleghanies the frequented trace bore nearly due south, but they turned now directly east into"], [241, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 221 the untrodden forest. Occasionally a hunter had passed that way, but never a man on horseback. There was no path ; for miles nothing but rolling stones, and pointed rocks, and steep declivities, down which the horsemen were forced to dismount and lead their animals. They passed through narrow defiles and over rocky ledges, where a single false step would plunge man and beast down to swift destruction. But several miles of such travel brought them to Oak Hollow, a slight depression amid the mountains, where a limpid spring issues from a wooded inclosure. Here, too much exhausted to pro ceed farther, they went into camp for the night. They were now in the midst of scenery that is mag nificent beyond description. Towering above them were several of the tallest peaks of the Alleghanies, clad in perpetual green, and, nestling at their feet, were grassy hollows, sprinkled with the myrtle and rhododendron, and arrayed in all the brilliant hues of autumn. After another day of clambering through rocky ravines and along the bed and margin of mountain streamlets, where only the wolf and wild rabbit had ever dared to tread, the adventurous band left behind them the mountain snows and descended upon a valley clad in verdure, where the air had an almost summer mildness. In three days they had marched sixty miles over such a route as never yet was traveled by horsemen, but at last they emerged from Gillespie's Gap, and beheld in the distance the smoke of the settlements upon the rich valleys of the upper Ca tawba. Here they were joined by Colonel McDowell,"], [242, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 222 who had left Sevier twelve days before at the rendezvous on the Watauga. McDowell had been at his home at Quaker Meadows, some forty miles away, and near the present site of Mor ganton. He brought encouraging tidings. Ferguson, he said, was still at his quarters at or near Gilbert Town ; and at Quaker Meadows the over-mountain men would be joined by Colonel Cleveland and three or four hun dred of the brave riders of Wilkes and Surry Counties. About as many of Sumteris men, under Colonels Hill and Lacey, were understood to be near Flint Hill, not fifty miles away, and it was probable they could be in duced to join the expedition. Assured now of success, the little army pressed rapidly forward, resting on this, the fourth night of their march, at the plantation of a wealthy Tory, where, says Ensign Campbell, \"we ob tained an abundance of every necessary refreshment.\" Early on the following morning they were on their way again, crossing before noon Silver and Linville Mountains, and marching thence down the northwest bank of the Catawba to Quaker Meadows, the home of the McDowells. Here they were most hospitably enter tained \u2014 Major McDowell even inviting them to help themselves to his dry rails to feed their camp-fires. In the course of the night they were joined by Colonel Cleveland and a well-mounted force of three hundred and fifty. They now numbered nearly fourteen hun dred, and Ferguson lay not forty miles away, with an army, as they still supposed, of not less than twenty-five"], [243, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 223 hundred ; but feeling able to cope with him, they pressed still more eagerly forward. The roads now were better, and their advance more rapid. They soon passed Pilot's Knob, and shortly after noon entered a gap in the South Mountain. Here a deluge of rain came down \u2014 one of those violent storms to which this mountain-region is subject \u2014 and they went into camp at a distance of about sixteen miles from Gilbert Town, sending out scouts to learn the exact position of Ferguson. The storm continued with the utmost violence dur ing the following day, and it was not deemed pru dent to move until they had more definite information as to the strength and position of Ferguson. In these circumstances the field-officers came together for con sultation. The force had been raised by no less than five officers of equal rank, and it had, therefore, a lack of symmetry and organization. On going into battle it would be necessary to have one efficient head, and some one proposed they should send to General Gates for a general officer to command them. This was generally assented to, but it did not meet the views of Sevier and Shelby. They had come out to fight Ferguson, who was now only a few miles away. Gates was understood to be at Hillsboro, a hundred and fifty miles distant, and, if they delayed to hear from him, the enemy might elude their grasp, aud get within the lines of Corn wallis at Charlotte. \" Then,\" said Governor Shelby, in a conversation with General Hardin, in 1819, \"it was determined that a board of officers should convene each"], [244, "224 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. night, and decide on the plan of operations for the next day, and that one of the officers should see those orders executed, as' officer of the day, until they should other wise conclude.\" As all of the superior officers, except Campbell, were from North Carolina, and he commanded the largest regiment, he was unanimously elected as the chief executive. McDowell was the ranking colonel, but he was considered too dilatory of movement for the emergency ; however, to save his feelings, it was agreed that he should proceed to General Gates for a general officer, leaving his regiment in charge of his brother, Major Joseph McDowell. The following morning was the seventh day of the march. The storm had cleared away, and, though they had no very definite information of Ferguson, the colo nels decided to resume the pursuit. As they were about to set out, Sevier rode among the men, and asked all to come together in a circle, to \"hear the news\" from Colonel Cleveland. Cleveland was a rough bor derer, but he had a rude sort of eloquence, which al ways inspired his troops with some of his own indomi table spirit. The men gathered about their officers, and then, removing his hat, Cleveland addressed them as follows : \"Now, my brave fellows, I have come to tell you the news. The enemy is at hand, and we must up and at them. Now is the time for every man of you to do his country a priceless service \u2014 such as shall lead your chil dren to exult in the fact that their fathers were the"], [245, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 225 conquerors of Ferguson. When the pinch comes, I shall be with you. But, if any of you shrink from shar ing in the battle and the glory, you can now have the opportunity of backing out, and leaving ; and you shall have a few minutes for considering the matter.\" When Cleveland had concluded, Major McDowell said with a pleasant smile on his face : \"Well, my good fellows, what kind of a story will you, who back out, have to relate when you get home, leaving your braver comrades to fight the battle and gain the victory ? \" And then Shelby added : \" You have all been in formed of the offer ; you who desire to decline it will, when the word is given, march three steps to the rear, and stand ; prior to which a few more minutes will be granted you for consideration.\" A silence of several minutes ensued, when word was given by the several officers to their respective com mands, that \"those who desired to back out should step three paces to the rear.\" Not a man stirred from the ranks. They glanced at one another, a glow of pride upon their faces, and then all around the circle broke out a murmur of applause. From that moment every man among them knew he could rely upon his comrades to the death. The officers shared in this feel ing. \"I am heartily glad,\" said Shelby to the men \u2014 \" I am heartily glad to see that to a man you resolve to meet and fight your country's foes. When we encount er the enemy, don't wait for the word of command. Let each one of you be his own officer, and do the very"], [246, "226 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. best you can ; taking every care you can of yourselves, and availing yourselves of every advantage that chance may throw in your way. If in the woods, shelter your selves, aud give them Indian play ; advance from tree to tree, pressing the enemy, and killing and disabling all you can. Your officers will shrink from no danger \u2014 they will be constantly with you, and the moment the enemy give way, be on the alert, and strictly obey orders.\"* Of such material was this rear-guard of the Revo lution. Had they been less brave, less self-devoted, this country might have had a different history. Every man was then ordered to provide two meals in his knapsack, and to be ready to march in three hours. Then they set out, threading the windings of Cane Creek, and by night arriving in the neighborhood of Gil bert Town, when, to their great chagrin, they learned that the game had flown. Ferguson had suddenly de camped from the vicinity some days before, announcing his intention to march to the British station at Ninety six. The over-mountain men arrived at Gilbert Town on the 4th of October. Four days before, the two deserters, Crawford and Chambers, had come to Ferguson with tidings of the rapid approach of the patriots through the defiles of the Alleghanies. From them he also * This report is taken from the narration of John Spetts, one of the survivors of the expedition, to Lyman C. Draper, LL. D., author of \"King's Mountain and its Heroes.\""], [247, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 227 learned the strength and composition of the patriot force, and the fact that they expected to be soon joined by the men of Wilkes and Surry. He now mustered, in camp, not more than twelve hundred men, having greatly depleted his army in his eagerness to capture Clarke on his retreat from Augusta, to do which he had express orders from Cornwallis. Clarke was understood to be moving northward along the base of the mount ains, and many of Ferguson's men being from that sec tion, he had allowed them to go home on furlough, in the hope to thereby gain knowledge of Clarke's move ments. Thus had Ferguson reduced his strength at the time of his utmost need, and thus did Clarke, by his very defeat, render a most essential service to his coun try. The intelligence startled Ferguson. He saw that, in stead of intimidating the Backwater men by his threats, he had merely drawn them from their mountain-coverts to give him battle in the open plain. His short experi ence of Shelby and his men had shown him that they were tireless riders and brave fighters, and re-enforced, as they doubtless soon would be, by Sumter's broken brigade, they would become an enemy too formidable for him to encounter in his present weakened condition. Quickly he saw his danger, and energetically he prepared to meet it. He was but eighty miles distant from Corn wallis, and had four days the start of his enemy. In these circumstances, a timid leader would have made the best of his way to his main body. But Ferguson"], [248, "228 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. was not a timid leader. No braver man than he ever wore a British uniform ; and such a thing as final re treat never entered into his calculations. He was in tent upon the capture of Clarke, and now, as it seemed to him, fortune had thrown in his way a still greater achievement \u2014 the capture or destruction of the over mountain men, which one blow would completely crush out disloyalty in North Carolina. He made his plans accordingly. He resolved to stay in that region to in tercept Clarke ; but to elude the Backwater men until he had collected his scattered force, or received re-en forcements, when he would give them battle, and, as he expressed it, \"finish the business in that quarter.\" This resolution taken, Ferguson at once dispatched expresses to gather iu his furloughed men, and sent trus ty messengers to Cruger and Cornwallis, asking for speedy re-enforcements. This done, it seemed only necessary to throw Sevier and the over-mountain men off his track for a few days, to accomplish a brilliant achievement that should win for him both promotion and glory. But Ferguson was trusting his fate to various contin gencies. What if his messengers should fail to get through to Cornwallis ? What if his furloughed men, seeing the dark cloud that was rolling down from the mountains, should prefer the shelter of their mud chinked cabins ? And what if among his pursuers were not only Shelby, who could fight and march a hundred miles in forty-eight hours, but Nolichucky Jack, who had been known to keep his saddle for a week, to ride"], [249, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 229 sixty miles a day, day in and day out, and whose Ten nessee yell was always a knell of death and disaster to his enemies ? But of this man Ferguson had as yet no knowledge ; so he quietly put his strategy in operation, troubled with no misgivings. Giving out that he was about to march to Ninety six, he took the direct route to that strong British sta tion. Arriving at Denard's Ford of the Broad River, late in the afternoon of Sunday, the 1st of October, he went into camp for the night in a strong position, and in the morning sent out circular letters, calling to him the men of that strong Tory neighborhood. Some of these letters have been preserved, and their urgent ap peals show that, while determined to stand his ground, Ferguson realized the danger of his position. In them he styled the over-mountain men \"barbarians,\" and \"the dregs of mankind,\" and said : \"If you wish or deserve to live, and bear the name of men, grasp your arms in a moment and run to camp. The Backwater men have crossed the mountains ; McDowell, Hampton, Shelby, and Cleveland are at their head, so that you know what you have to depend upon. If you choose to be degraded for ever and ever by a set of mongrels, say so at once, and let your women turn their backs upon you, and look out for real men to protect them ! \" From the ford, where Ferguson was now encamped, Ninety-six was distant nearly a hundred miles directly south, while the headquarters of Cornwallis, at Char lotte, were only about seventy miles almost due east-"], [250, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 230 erly. It was not Ferguson's intention to fall back upon either position, but, the nearer he should get to Cornwallis, the sooner would he receive his desired re-enforcements. To march in that direction, and send his pursuers far down on the route to Ninety-six, was the object of his strategy. He was now in the midst of a dense forest, remote from any dwelling, and on the bank of a fordable river, which ran for twenty miles in the direction of Cornwallis's quarters. He had only to march a few miles along the bed of that river, hiding his footsteps in the running stream, and to capture and detain the few patriots of the region, to prevent intelli gence of his movements from reaching Sevier and Shel by when they should move down from Gilbert Town. They would here lose his trail, but the chances were that they would push directly on, believing the report that he was on the march to Ninety-six. Thus they would be wasting their strength on a southerly route, while he was thirty miles away at the east, and in receipt, no doubt, of re-enforcements from Cornwallis. He could then easily retrace his steps to Gilbert Town, intercept Sevier and Shelby, and also draw the fugitive Clarke into the net he had laid for his compatriots. These were, no doubt, Ferguson's tactics, though there is no written evidence of it, and the exact route he pursued is lost to even the traditions of the neighbor hood. The only record of his movements at this time is in the diary of Allaire, one of his lieutenants. He says, under date of Monday, October 2d : \" Got in mo-"], [251, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 231 tion at four o'clock in the afternoon ; forded Broad River ; marched four miles ; formed in line of action, and lay on our arms.\" At four o'clock on the following morning Ferguson was again in motion, and marching twenty miles on the direct route to Charlotte, he went into camp at night about a mile east of Buffalo Creek, a tributary of Broad River, only two days' march from Cornwallis, and fully twenty-five miles distant from the route that would be taken by his pursuers, who had not yet arrived at Gilbert Town. Here, feeling reasonably secure, Ferguson decided to wait his expected re-enforcements, but he sent out scouts to learn the exact whereabout of his enemy. For some reason, to him unaccountable, he had not yet heard from Cornwallis, and only a single company of eighty men had joined him from Cruger, at Ninety-six. Multi tudes of Tories came to his camp, but very few of his furloughed troops, or men able to carry a musket. They were mostly aged loyalists, handier with the tongue than with the sword, and just now Ferguson was in sore need of the more cutting kind of implement. However, he gave courteous welcome to all, for he was a well-mannered gentleman, and content to talk, when he could not fight, for his king and country. Among his visitors was a venerable, white-haired man, who especially won his confidence. The old man's mouth was full of loyalty to the good king, who was so kindly serving out to his distant children free rations of grape and gun powder ; and he hoped that every one of the over-mount-"], [252, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 232 ain men might partake so freely of these rations as to never again hunger. Like most men of decided bravery, Ferguson was unsuspicious and outspoken. He did not recognize the devil's livery of deceit in which the old gentleman was arrayed ; so he opened his plans to him freely, and told him he had just dispatched a messenger to Cornwallis for Tarleton and four hundred of his in vincible dragoons. They would arrive in four days, at the latest, and then he would make short work of the men from the Backwater. What Ferguson told his aged visitor was doubtless true ; but his dispatch never got to Cornwallis. The messenger probably shared the fate of the two who had set out with his previous dispatch from near Gilbert Town. Calling on their way at the house of a patriot for breakfast, these men allowed their haste to betray them, and, being then closely followed by the farmers' sons, they were obliged to hide in the woods until their missive was too old to be of any service to Ferguson. This was one of those contingencies on which hung the fate of the British commander; and it was also one of those small events, pregnant with great consequences, which meet us everywhere in the history of this rear guard of the Revolution. The aged loyalist who had so won upon the confi dence of Ferguson was at heart a stanch patriot. Doubt less he was ashamed of the devil's clothing in which he had arrayed himself to worm out the secrets of the Brit ish officer. It is certain that he did penance for his"], [253, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 233 falsehood by a ride of more than twenty miles, on a dark night, through a dismal forest and over swollen streams to the nearest American encampment. This was at Flint Hill, where lay the broken remains of Sumter's brigade. The heroic leader himself was in hiding, badly wounded, and his men were now in command of Colonels Hill and Lacey, of South Carolina, who were waiting for some opportunity to strike a blow for the patriot cause. They numbered about four hundred men \u2014 far too weak a force to attempt to cope with Ferguson, and this they keenly regretted, when told by the old dissembler that the Brit ish commander lay within a few hours' ride of their rifles. But, toward the close of that day \u2014 the 5th of October \u2014 they learned from their scouts of the advance of the over-mountain men to Gilbert Town and their march toward Ninety-six, in the vain hope of overtaking Ferguson. Instantly the two colonels resolved to set them right, and to tender their own men to re-enforce the expedition. Colonel Hill was suffering from a re cent wound, and could not endure a night ride of thirty miles ; but at eight o'clock Colonel Lacey mounted his horse, and, attended by only a single guide, set out to find the men from the Backwater. The night was again very dark. They soon lost their way, and, suspecting treachery, Lacey was twice on the point of shooting his guide ; but merciful thoughts came to him on each occasion, and some hours after midnight he was rewarded by being led to the out lying pickets of the over-mountain men, who were en-"], [254, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 234 camped only two miles beyond where they had lost the trail of Ferguson at Denard's Ford. Stating his errand, Lacey was blindfolded and led to the quarters of the commanding colonels. Every one of them was astir, though it wanted yet some hours to daybreak ; but they received his advances with distrust, taking him at first for a Tory spy. In this region a man could not trust his nearest neighbor, and Lacey was a stranger to every one in the encampment. But he was not to be repulsed. He told them what he knew about Ferguson, and, offer ing to join his force with theirs, proposed to set out at once to attack him, before he could receive his expected re-enforcement from Cornwallis. Lacey's evident sin cerity at last convinced the wary backwoodsmen, and they gladly accepted his proposal, agreeing to join him at sunset of the following day at the Cowpens, a place which, only a hundred days later, was to witness the dis astrous defeat of Tarleton by General Morgan. The colo nels then told Lacey that they had lost the trail of Fer guson at the crossing of Broad River, but, convinced that he had gone on to Ninety-six, they had spent the greater part of the night in selecting seven hundred of their best-mounted men, with whom they meant to pursue and bring him to battle before he could effect a junction with Colonel Cruger. His arrival had saved them from that fatal mistake ; and thus it was that the night-ride of the venerable wearer of devil's clothing had important consequences. The Cowpens was twenty-one miles from the camp of"], [255, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 235 the patriot colonels, and about the same distance from Sumter's men at Flint Hill. To reach the latter place Lacey had a rough ride of nearly thirty miles, over a wretched road and through a hilly country ; but he was at the rendezvous with his troops a little after sunset on the 6th of October, thus riding fifty miles, and muster ing and marching his men, in the short space of fifteen hours. At the Cowpens Lacey was soon joined by Se vier and the other colonels, with their seven hundred chosen mounted men. The remainder of the force, num bering six hundred and ninety, had been left behind to follow on the trail of the advance as rapidly as they were able ; but they were not counted on for effective service, it being thought that the utmost speed would be required to reach Ferguson before he should receive re enforcements. With Colonels Hill and Lacey was Colonel Williams, the efficient officer who had fought so gallantly at Mus grove's Mill. Their combined forces numbered about four hundred and fifty; but when the best men, best rifles, and best horses, were winnowed from among the rest, there were found only two hundred and ten who were thought capable of marching fifty miles with out food, and then fighting a fresh and well-disciplined enemy of superior numbers. When the selection was completed, the flying squadron counted precisely nine hundred and ten men \u2014 truly a small force to have com mitted to it the task of turning an important page in human history."], [256, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 236 The Cowpens received its name from being the resi dence of a wealthy Tory, who employed a large number of pens in the stalling of his cattle. Some of his ani mals were now made contraband of war by the patriots, and it is recorded by one of the expedition that they reaped fifty acres of his corn in about ten minutes. The night was again very dark, and heavy clouds portended an early storm, but soon hundreds of camp-fires cast a lurid glow over all the surrounding country. By these fires the half-famished men were having a feast that they had not known since leaving Watauga. They had marched for ten days through a thinly settled country, destitute of provisions, and their fare had been of the most meager description. Parched corn-meal, or the green ear roast ed, had been their principal ration, and one of them says, \"I thought green pumpkins, sliced and fried, about the sweetest eating I ever had in my life.\" Even of such food their supply had been scanty, but now they had broiled beef in plenty \u2014 eaten, however, without salt, and in haste, for the order to march would be issued as soon as the officers should have finished the winnowing of the newly arrived forces. The order came before the more tardy among them had fully broiled their steaks ; but the larger number managed to provide a few ears of roasted corn for their knapsacks. And there was need of haste. A scout, who joined the force on its arrival at the Cowpens, reported that he had seen Ferguson that very morning, marching east ward, and ten miles distant from his late encampment."], [257, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 237 His army did not exceed fifteen hundred men, but it was moving toward Cornwallis, and was not, at that time, more than thirty miles from Charlotte. Another scout soon came in, bringing tidings that Major Gibbs, a noted loyalist, was only four miles away, with from four to six hundred Tories, whom he intended to lead to Ferguson on the following day ; and other smaller bodies of loyal ists were known to be in the neighborhood. There was need, therefore, of haste, if the patriots would overtake Ferguson before he was joined by these Tories, and had received re-enforcements from headquarters, from which he was now distant only a forced march of less than twen ty-four hours. By some, it was proposed that the little army should fall on and annihilate Gibbs and the other Tories ; but this was opposed by Sevier and Shelby. They had, they again said, come out to fight Fergu son. Let the meaner game go. If he were crushed, the head would be gone, and the body would inevitably fall to pieces. The information brought by the scouts was correct. Ferguson had broken camp at four o'clock on the morn ing of that day, and marched sixteen miles to King's Mountain. He was pretty accurately informed of the movements of the over-mountain men, as may be seen from the following dispatch, which, on setting out, he sent to Cornwallis : \"Mt Lord : A doubt does not remain with regard to the intelligence I sent your lordship. They are since"], [258, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 238 joined by Clarke and Sumter\u2014 of course, are become an object of some consequence. Happily, their leaders are obliged to feed their followers with such hopes, and so to flatter them with accounts of our weakness and fear, that, if necessary, I should hope for success against them myself ; but, numbers compared, that must be but doubt fuL \"I am on my march toward you by a road leading from Cherokee Ford, north of King's Mountain. Three or four hundred good soldiers, part dragoons, would fin ish the business. Something must be done soon. This is their last push in this quarter.\" Ferguson was mistaken as to Clarke and Sumter. Thirty of Clarke's men, and all that remained of Sum ter's, were with the patriots ; but the two leaders them selves were absent from their commands, Sumter at that time wounded and in concealment, and Clarke, his wife, and some of his scattered troops, enjoying the hospitality of the \" Bonnie Kate,\" at Sevier's log palace on the Noli chucky. He also greatly overestimated the patriot force. Allaire states that they were twenty-five hundred strong when they attacked at King's Mountain, and this was probably Ferguson's present estimate. But, however much he exaggerated his enemy's strength, Ferguson had no thought of further retreat. He had now taken up a strong position, from which, he said, he could not be driven by all the rebels out of \u2014 sheol, and there he in tended to hold his ground. This is evident from the"], [259, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 239 following extract from a biographical sketch of him, written by his distinguished relative, Dr. Adam Fergu son : \" He dispatched a messenger to Lord Cornwallis, to inform his lordship of what had passed \u2014 of the ene mies he had to deal with \u2014 of the route he had taken to avoid them ; earnestly expressing his wish that he might be enabled to cover a country in which there were so many well-affected inhabitants ; adding that for this purpose he should halt at King's Mountain, hoping that he might be there supported by a detachment from his lordship, and saved the necessity of any further re treat.\" This letter was intercepted by the patriots, and a duplicate that was sent on the following day, arrived too late to prevent the disaster which overtook Ferguson. The nine hundred and ten mounted men set out on their march from the Cowpens about nine o'clock that evening, and they were followed by about fifty foot-sol diers, whose ardor to meet the enemy could not be re pressed by either mud, or storm, or darkness. For the night was intensely dark, and a drizzling rain was fall ing, miring the roads, and making them all but impass able for foot-passengers. Before many hours the drizzle became a pouring rain, and to shield their rifles from the wet the men were obliged to wrap their blankets and hunting-shirts about the locks, thus exposing their bod ies to the full fury of the storm. The rain lasted all the night, but they kept on, wet to the skin, and often losing their way in the darkness, but never halting a moment till, with the first streak of day, they came to"], [260, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 240 the range of low hills which overlook the Cherokee Ford of Broad River. Here they drew up on the sum mit, while Enoch Gilmer, their most trusted scout, went forward to reconnoitre the ford, it being feared that the enemy might have waylaid the crossing. Of thi3 scout I may as well say a few words, for he was of great service to the expedition. The over-mount ain men were in a strange country, where nearly every man they met was a Tory, and not merely a Tory, but a creature of low, half-devilish instincts, from whom it was next to impossible to extract truthful and reliable in formation. Without any purpose except pure mischief they took delight in misleading the expedition, and would have counted it a huge joke had it miscarried through their false tidings. It was owing to the sol emn assertions of two of these men, that they had seen Ferguson on the road to Ninety-six, that the patriot colo nels were led to follow on that route after they had lost the trail of the enemy at Broad River. As I have said, a hundred years have not improved these people. They still inhabit that region, live in the same mud chinked hovels, wear the same coarse \"butternuts,\" and have the same personal characteristics \u2014 those of the porcine animal, whose flesh is their favorite article of diet. Giving freedom to such men was literally easting \"pearls before swine,\" but to this end were Sevier and his comrades now marching and fighting. The scout Gilmer was unacquainted with the region, but was peculiarly fitted for gathering information in"], [261, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 241 any locality. He belonged to a class of which some con- spicuous examples were developed by our recent civil war \u2014 born actors, who could assume any character at pleasure, laugh and weep in the same breath, be grave or gay, wise or \"otherwise,\" a sane man or a lunatic, and act each part so naturally as to deceive the most astute reader of human nature. To these uncommon traits Gilmer added absolute fearlessness, perfect self- possession, keen observation, and a shrewdness that could neither be misled nor baffled. While the troops were de- tained at the Cowpens, he had pushed on a few miles to the house of a wealthy Tory, and in an incredibly short time had so won on his confidence as to draw from him all that he knew of the enemy's intentions. Cornwal- lis, the Tory said, was calling in his outposts and con- centrating his forces, to give Gates another crushing de- feat, when North Carolina would be fully at his feet, and an unobstructed road opened before him through Virginia, which State he would enter with a larger army than had yet been seen on American soil. All which might have come to pass but for the handful of cold and hungry men, in dripping blankets and hunting-shirts, wearied with forty-two miles of hard riding, who, with in a few hours, filed swiftly past the old Tory's door- way. They looked to him like a battalion of drowned rats, but their powder was dry, and so were the locks of their unerring Deckard rifles, and before the sun should again go down he should hear that the brilliant dream of Cornwallis had been dispelled in a smoke of their raising. 11"], [262, "242 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. Gilmer now rode fearlessly forward to the Cherokee Ford, and soon the men in waiting on the hills heard him singing at the top of his voice, \" Barney Linn,\" a song of the period. At this signal that the road was clear, they again moved forward. The river was swollen with the still falling rain, but the troops could be no wetter than they were, and, holding their rifles aloft, they plunged boldly into the deep and rapid stream \u2014 those best mount ed taking the upper side, as most able to withstand the current. When all were safely over, they pressed on again. They were satisfied that Ferguson was not far in advance, and on the road they were pursuing, but of how far away he was, or how posted, they were igno rant. To make these discoveries, Gilmer was again sent forward. He dashed off at a rapid gallop, the squad following at a slower pace, till at a short distance they came to the camping-ground which Ferguson had left only twenty-four hours before. Here the officers called a halt of a few minutes to allow the men to snatch a hasty and meager breakfast from the store in their knap sacks, and some standiug corn they found by the road side. The men feasted upon the raw ears, and served out the stalks to their horses. This done, they took to the road again, satisfied from the fresh tracks that they were not far in the rear of Ferguson. They had marched twenty-one miles in a pouring rain, and now the storm increased, and the rain came down even faster. The windows of heaven seemed to be open and pouring out a deluge of water. It struck"], [263, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 243 upon their drenched bodies like pellets of hail, chilling them through to the very marrow of their bones. Some of the horses gave out, and some of the men sank ex hausted upon their saddles. In these circumstances a few of the colonels held a hurried consultation, and rid ing forward to Shelby, who led the advance, told him that they had decided to halt for a while to give the men a little rest and refreshment. \"I will not stop until night,\" he answered, curtly, \" if I follow Ferguson into Cornwallis's lines ! \" Without reply they rode back to their commands, and no more was said about rest or refreshment. At the distance of eleven miles from the ford they came upon a semi-loyalist, from whom they learned that Ferguson was encamped only eight miles beyond ; and here they fortunately captured a couple of Tories. Being promised their liberty, these men gave the patriots some account of the situation of the enemy, and guided them on the way to his encampment. So they pressed on again, with renewed courage. About noon the rain ceased, the clouds cleared away, and the sun came out bright and glorious, sending warmth into their chilled limbs, stiffened as they were from nearly fifty miles of constant riding. A smile seemed now to overspread the whole of Nature, and in this both officers and men saw an omen of good fortune to the expedition ; so again they took courage, and pressed still more eagerly for ward. At the end of another five miles, some of Sevier's"], [264, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 244 men entered a Tory dwelling. From the men of the family they could extract nothing more than that Fer guson was not far away ; but, as they left the house, a woman followed them who asked, \"How many are there of you?\" \"Enough to whip Ferguson, if we can find him ! \" they answered. \" He is on that mountain,\" she replied, pointing to a spur of the King's Mountain range, about three miles away. Riding on some distance farther, Colonel Campbell, and some other officers who were in the advance, de scried the horse of Gilmer tied at the gateway of a house about half a mile up the road. Campbell had no special acquaintance with the scout, but he had been told of his vaunted coolness and bravery, and he determined upon a practical joke that should test his possession of those qualities. Making a lasso of a rope, he put spurs to his horse, and with several others rode at full gallop for the dwelling. Entering it, they found Gilmer seated at dinner with the family, two of whom were women, and one young and good-looking. \" You d \u2014 d rascal,\" shouted the devout Presbyterian, \"we have got you!\" \" A true king's man,\" replied Gilmer, with even stronger emphasis. Dragging the scout from the table, the pious colonel swore that he would hang him from the cross bar of the gate before the doorway ; at which the wom en screamed and burst into tears. Seeing this, Major Chronicle, who was Gilmer's friend, besought the colo nel not to hang him there, lest his ghost should dis turb the family. To this the colonel assented, declar-"], [265, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 245 ing, however, that the Tory should swing from the first overhanging limb. Then the scout was dragged away, and, when well out of sight of the house, was duly re leased, and asked to tell his story. In such rude sports these men could engage on the very eve of a desperate battle. The family were of decided Tory principles. The scout had ingratiated himself with them by professing to be a \"true king's man,\" who desired to find Fergu son in order to enlist with him. This so overjoyed the women that they allowed the scout to express his sympathy with their principles by giving each a hearty smack ; and this pressure of the lips so opened the heart and mouth of the younger woman, that she told Gilmer she had been to Ferguson's camp, with some poultry, that very morning ; and that it was only three miles away, on a ridge between two streams, where a party of hunters had encamped during the previous autumn. Among these hunters had been Major Chroni cle and Captain Mattocks, two of the officers on the ex pedition, so that the j)atriots had now exact knowledge of Ferguson's position. Scarcely slackening the pace of the squadron, the commanding colonels now gathered about Chronicle, and, as they rode forward, listened to his description of the position of Ferguson. At once and unanimously they decided to surround his encampment, and attempt the capture or destruction of his entire army. A plan of battle was speedily agreed upon. Still sitting upon"], [266, "246 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. their horses, they provided for every detail of the com ing engagement. The little army should be divided into four columns, two of which, under Sevier and Shel by, should march forward in the road ; the two others, under Campbell and Cleveland, on each side of it, and all in full view of one another. In this order they should move onward as noiselessly as possible to the foot of the mountain, when Sevier and Campbell should de ploy to the right, Cleveland and Shelby to the left, and thus completely encircle Ferguson. Then dismounting, and tethering their horses in the timber, they should raise the Tennessee yell, and simultaneously, all around the circle, begin the attack. It is not known with whom this plan of battle originated ; but, from whomever it came, it was a flash of genius. No other could have succeeded. Approached according to the rules of mod ern warfare, the position of the British was impregnable. This was Ferguson's own opinion, and it was confirmed by General Bernard, an aide-de-camp of Napoleon, who, after examining the ground, said : \" The shape of the hill itself would be an eternal monument of the military genius and skill of Colonel Ferguson. . . . No other plan of assault but that pursued by the mountain-men could have succeeded against him.\" Hitherto the men had marched without any regard to military order, singly or in small squads, as suited their convenience ; but now a halt was called, and every man was ordered to take his appropriate position under his proper commander. Strict silence was also enjoined,"], [267, "THE MARCH TO THE BATTLE. 247 and then, as mute as the jaded beasts they rode, the battalion moved again rapidly forward. At a little dis tance, Sevier's advance captured two or three Tories, who confirmed the scout's report of the position of Fer guson, and pointed out the locality of his pickets. These were come upon noiselessly by Shelby, and captured without firing a gun ; and a short distance farther on a youth was made prisoner, who was riding express to Cornwallis. On him were found dispatches from Ferguson, which were read to the men \u2014 all but the statement of his numbers, which, being larger than their own, was kept secret by the officers. Then, when with in about a third of a mile of the enemy's position, they halted amid the thick woods and fastened their horses to the branches of trees. The nine hundred and ten mounted men were all there, and, incredible as it may seem, the fifty riflemen who had come on afoot were also present. They had marched nearly fifty miles in eighteen hours, through mud, and rain, and darkness. The men were now ordered to strap their blankets and overcoats to their saddles. This done, the final word was given, \"Fresh prime your guns, and every man go into battle firmly resolved to fight till he dies ! \" Then stern and silently they encircled the hill ; and then the long roll of the British drum echoed amid the trees, and a shower of bullets, falling among Shelby's men, pro claimed that the battle had begun."], [268, "CHAPTER XII. KING'S MOUNTAIN. The spot where the battle was fought is not entitled to the name of mountain. It is a narrow ridge of ground, about a third of a mile long, and at its great est breadth not more than three hundred and fifty feet wide \u2014 a mere spur of a loftier eminence known as King's Mountain. Standing anywhere upon its summit, a man is within short range of a rifleman posted on either side of the hill. It rises only sixty feet from the sur rounding country, but its sides slope steeply, and at the time of the battle were covered with a heavy growth of timber, behind which the assailants could shield their approach ; but at the summit they would be met by a high escarpment of rocks, broken, jagged, and heaped confusedly together, forming in many places a breast work as difficult to scale as the stone walls of a fortress. Behind these rocks Ferguson was posted, his baggage wagons drawn together to protect the most exposed point of his position, which was at the wider extremity of the elevation. With him was a force of something more than eleven hundred men, about one hundred and fifty of whom were British regulars, armed with musket and"], [269, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 249 bayonet, and the remainder Tory militia, provided with rifles, and many of them with long butcher-knives, made to fit firmly into the muzzles of their pieces. In a charge, these knives would be as effective as the reg ular bayonet. The Tories Ferguson had carefully drilled during several months, and he relied upon them with nearly as much confidence as on his famous regulars. Defended by such soldiers, he regarded his position as impregnable. The over-mountain men had marched for thirty-six hours with scarcely any rest or food ; but, now pausing only long enough to strap their blankets to their sad dles, and tether their horses among the trees, they filed rapidly around the ridge, to attack an enemy thus strongly posted, refreshed by rest and sleep, and, as their leaders knew from the captured dispatches, considerably their superior in numbers. Sevier led the way with the right wing, Cleveland and Williams followed with the left, and Campbell and Shelby with the center brought up the rear, and in this order the combined forces moved steadily to their assigned places. These taken, they would completely encircle the enemy's position, Shelby being opposite to Campbell, Sevier to Williams and Lacy, and the forces of Cleveland joining those of Sevier at the wider extremity of the ridge, which was barricaded by the baggage-wagons. As Shelby and Campbell had a shorter distance to march than the others, they would be the first to reach their places ; but orders were given them to defer the attack until Sevier and Cleveland had"], [270, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 250 got into position, when the latter should raise the Ten nessee yell, and all should rush simultaneously upon the enemy. But the early firing of the British frustrated this arrangement. As Shelby approached the hill, he discovered a gap leading directly to the enemy's position on the summit. Entering this, he was met by a volley from the British, and his men began to fall around him. They pleaded for permission to return the fire; but he answered : \"No! Press on to your places, and your fire will not be wasted.\" They pressed rapidly on, and thus the battle began ten minutes before Sevier and Cleveland had reached their appointed positions. Meanwhile, hearing the firing, Campbell ordered his men to scale the hill, and attack on the side opposite to Shelby. The doughty Presbyterian was in his shirt sleeves, stripped for the fight ; and, waving above his head an old claymore which had come down to him from his Scottish ancestors, he shouted to his men : \" Here they are, my brave boys ; shout like h \u2014 11, and fight like devils ! \" The ground at this point is craggy, abrupt, and difficult of ascent ; but, creeping slowly up the acclivity, and dodging from tree to tree, it was not many minutes before Campbell's men were near the sum mit. There they paused, and poured in a volley upon the solid mass of British, which mowed them down as grain is mown down by the sickle. At the same moment Shelby, having reached his position, opened a fire on the British rear, and soon the signal-yell broke"], [271, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 251 from the farther end of the hill, and the deadly work be gan all around the mountain. The shout was taken up by the whole attacking force, till the woods echoed with the unearthly sound \u2014 more terrible even than the sharp crack of the backwoods rifles. Hearing it, De Peyster said to Ferguson, \"This is ominous\u2014 these are those yelling devils ! \" He had heard that shout at Musgrove's Mill, and knew that it meant desperate fighting. But Ferguson was not to be intimidated by yells or bullets. Instantly he ordered his regulars to charge down upon Campbell with the bayonet, and a like force of Tories to drive Shelby from the other side with their butcher-knives. Campbell's men fell back slowly till some of them were thrust through and through, when the rest retreated more rapidly to the very foot of the hill and even beyond it. But Campbell had them well in hand. When it seemed to him that they had gone far enough, he called to them to halt and reload. This they \"did in a moment, and up the hill they went again, driving the British before them, and pouring upou them a rapid fire that crimsoned the hill-side. On the retreat, Lieutenant Edmonston, who had fought so bravely at Long Island Flats, was thrust through the arm, but, sheltering himself only long enough to have the limb bandaged, he joined his men in the return charge, saying, \" Boys, let us at it again ! \" In a similar manner Shelby was driven down the opposite slope by the butcher-knife bayonets of the Tories. Firing as they went, his men fell back slowly"], [272, "252 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. to the foot of the declivity. However, falling back with them, as with Campbell, did not mean retreat. Every man knew it to be the prearranged tactics of the leaders, and when Shelby shouted, \"Now, boys, reload, aud let's advance upon them and give them another fire ! \" they quickly turned, formed in columns, and went up the hill again, their leader at their head. All through the fight, \" Shelby, a man of the hardiest make, stiff as iron, among the dauntless singled out for dauntlessness, went right onward and upward, like a man who had but one thing to do, and but one thought \u2014 to do it.\" * Sevier and Cleveland had already joined in the at tack, and now, says Shelby, \"the mountain was covered with flame and smoke, and seemed to thunder.\" As Cleveland led his men to the attack he could not resist making them a speech after his backwoods fashion. In broken sentences he shouted as they climbed the hill in the face of a terrible fire : \" My brave fellows, we have beaten the Tories, and we can beat them again. They are all cowards. If they had the spirit of men, they would join us in supporting the independence of the country. When you are engaged, do not wait for the word of command. I will show you by my exam ple how to fight. I can undertake no more. Every man must act on his own judgment. Fire as fast as you can, and stand your ground as long as you can. When you can do no better, get behind trees, or retreat ; * Bancroft."], [273, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 253 but I beg you not to run quite off.\" Then, pointing to the crest of the hill down which a deadly fire was plunging, he cried, \"Yonder is your enemy, and the enemy of mankind ! \" Then they went up the hill, and from behind trees, and rocks, and fallen logs, and every natural protection, poured their well-directed fire, pausing only to reload, which done, they would dash suddenly for some higher up shelter, their leader every now and then calling out, \"A little nearer, my brave men, a little nearer ! \" Thus they crept up the slope, firing as they went, and every bullet doing its fatal work, till they stood face to face with the Tories on the summit. Then ensued a fearful hand-to-hand encounter, in which, singling out their opponents, men grappled with one another in deadly struggle, amid shouts and yells and curses that echoed far away amid the peaceful forest. Such is war, stripped of its sham glory, and seen in its utter na kedness \u2014 a carnival of wild beasts, a pastime for devils. If great principles were not at stake, if through such fiery ordeals the race of man did not rise to higher levels of progress and freedom, what human being would have the heart to turn a single page in this world's bloody history ? Meanwhile Sevier had led his men up to the eastern crest, right against the center and most solid masses of the enemy. He made them no harangue \u2014 none was needed, for they were accustomed to follow where he led, without thought or question. Every man among them"], [274, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 254 had been with him before in as deadly peril. Straight up the hill they went, right into the enemy's fire, pausing only at the very summit. Here the barricade of rocks gave them the same protection it gave the enemy, and even greater, for the British were firing down-hill, and of necessity overshot the mark, wounding only the trees along the hill-side. In Sevier's little army every man was a sharp-shooter, and when he halted at the summit, and said, \"Now, boys, single out your men, take sure aim, and \u2014 fire ! \" the havoc that followed was terrible. The British went down like bent grain before a torrent of hail \u2014 they were piled iu heaps, like sea-weed thrown up by an ocean-storm. The hill streamed red with the carnage. The little mountain was now everywhere in eruption, belching forth smoke and lightning and thunder. One long, sulphureous blaze encircled and flashed everywhere along it from base to summit. Two thousand stal wart men were wrestling there in a life-and-death strug gle, and the shouts of the combatants, the cries of the wounded, the moans of the dying, mingling with the sharp report of the rifle, and the startling Indian yell that every now and then broke forth along the American lines, made up a din deafening and appalling. But above it all rose the shrill whistle of the British com mander, by which he rallied aud directed his men in the conflict. In his wounded left hand he carried a slim silver tube, and its well-understood signals conveyed his orders to all parts of the mountain. Though him-"], [275, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 255 self in the thickest of the fight abreast of Sevier, he was thus in a manner everywhere present. Thus, for more than half an hour the battle raged, the patriots now repulsed and now again driving the enemy. Time and again the British bayonets drive them down the hill, aud time and again they reform and force the enemy back with terrible slaughter. As those on one side of the hill give way, those on the other advance, and thus the British are between two fires continually. This happens to all but Sevier's men, who from behind their barricade of rocks pour in a fire so rapid that they can not be approached by the bayonet. Huddled closely together, Ferguson's soldiers are a broad target for the unerring backwoods rifle. Their ranks are being thinned rapidly, and, seeing this, the British leader mus ters his bayonets for a supreme effort. Twice has he driven Campbell down the hill, and twice has Campbell returned to the onset ; and now again with closed ranks De Peyster, his second in command, forces the heroic Presbyterians down the declivity, while along the British lines goes up the shout, \"Tarleton and his legion are coming ! \" The weary patriots hear the shout, and their fire slackens. The famous legion is a terror throughout the Carolinas. To be taken by it in rear, with such an enemy in front, might well appall the bravest. The quick ear of Sevier catches the sound, and his keen eye discerns the danger. His brother Robert has been struck down by his side, three of his riflemen are stretched dead at his feet, and his best men are wavering."], [276, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 256 It is indeed the crisis of the battle, for, looking off to the south, he sees that Campbell's retreat has become a rout \u2014 some of his men are transfixed, some have been pushed headlong over the cliffs, and all are fleeing in disorder. They seem irreparably broken. That British shout is in their ears, and the panic of Camden is about to be repeated. But Sevier is never so cool as in the mo ment of greatest danger. He speaks a few words to his men, and then, amid that storm of bullets, leaps upon his horse and rushes with his entire left wing to the rescue of Campbell. The pious Presbyterian is dismounted, and posted half-way between his own men and the pursuing British. His shirt is unbuttoned, a red bandanna is about his head, his face is begrimed with smoke and powder, and, flourishing his old claymore about him, he is calling upon his men to halt, with oaths strong enough to rend the mountain from base to summit. But his men do not halt. That British shout has got into their legs, and it drives them farther and farther away from the enemy. But now Sevier and his riflemen are among them. Of that strange magnetic power, by which one can infuse his spirit into a thousand, I suppose no man ever possessed a larger share than this intrepid soldier of the backwoods. Those who saw him in battle have said, \" His eyes were flames of fire, and his words electric bolts, crashing down the ranks of the enemy.\" He now says but little, but what he does say arrests that demoralized crowd till they turn about, and, with"], [277, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 257 the brave Campbell, and his own Watauga boys, rush again fiercely up the mountain. A wounded Tory, who was lying half-way down the slope, has described their appearance as they now returned to the onset. \" They were,\" he says, \"the most powerful-looking men lever beheld \u2014 tall, raw-boned, and sinewy, such men, as a body, as were never before seen in the Carolinas. They ap peared like so many devils from the infernal regions, so full of excitement were they as they rushed like en raged lions up the mountain.\" Sevier watches them as they go up the slope, and then, still on horseback, and within short musket-range of the enemy, he moves along among the other weary patriots, and, everywhere he moves, the men gather strength, and rush with renewed courage upon the enemy. \" Let them come on, my men,\" he says \u2014 \" Gibbs and Moore and their Tories, and Tarleton and his dra goons to boot ! One more charge will end Ferguson, and then we will finish Tarleton and the Tories ! \" It was this ride of Sevier that won the battle. But Sevier was back in his place in time to join in the last desperate grapple with the enemy. It lasted twenty minutes, during which the two forces were not a hundred feet apart, and the slaughter was terrific. As Campbell's men and the Watauga boys mounted the crest, they were joined by Shelby, and together they scaled the rocks and moved down upon the enemy. Slowly the British regulars fell back toward the east ern end of the hill, where Sevier and Cleveland were"], [278, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 258 mowing down their Tory comrades. Ferguson orders a charge, to end this cross-firing, and De Peyster moves forward with a strong force of leveled bayonets ; but, when he reaches the lines of Sevier, only twelve of his men are fit for duty \u2014 the rest had been shot down by the Watauga riflemen. Slowly but steadily Shelby and Campbell push the British back along the crest of the mountain, which now is slippery with blood, and strewed with the dead and the dying. Soon British and Tories are huddled together at the farther end of the hill, where the hail is falling from the rifles of Se vier and Cleveland. The Tories raise a white flag, but Ferguson orders it down. Soon another goes up, which he levels with his sword ; and then De Peyster tells him that further resistance is a waste of life, and urges a surrender. This the British leader refuses ; but soon, seeing that all is lost, he spurs his horse directly upon Sevier's lines, with the desperate resolve to break through and escape down the mountain. One of Sevier's men, named Gilliland, recognizes him by the linen hunting shirt which he wears over his uniform. Gilliland is lean ing against a tree, severely wounded and well-nigh ex hausted, but he levels his rifle at the British leader. It flashes in the pan, and he calls to his comrade, Rob ert Young, \"There is Ferguson \u2014 shoot him!\" Young fires, and the British officer falls from his horse, mortally wounded. No less than five other rifles crack at almost the same instant, and each one of as many Watauga riflemen claimed to have killed Ferguson. No doubt"], [279, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 259 they all told the truth, for that number of mortal wounds were found upon the body of the British leader. A scene of wild confusion follows. Seeing his leader fallen, and unable to form six of his men together, De Peyster orders a white flag raised. Its bearer is at once shot down by the infuriated patriots, some of whom do not understand this signal of surrender. Another flag is then raised on the end of a rifle, and Evan Shelby rides forward and receives the sword of the British commander, where he stands, near the baggage wagons. There, in a few moments, Sevier and Shelby come together for the first time since the beginning of the battle. Sevier, as he scans the face of his younger comrade, utters an exclamation of surprise, saying, \" They have singed off your hair ! \" A British musket had been discharged so near as to burn Shelby's beard. Then they order the enemy to throw down their arms, and the patriots to cease firing. The last order is obeyed by all but one solitary rifle. Ping ! ping ! it goes every few seconds, from the farther end of the hill, and its balls fall with deadly effect among the solid mass of British and Tories. The discharges are from a young lad just at the edge of the crest, and an of ficer is sent to order him to stop firing. \"I won't!\" he answers ; \"the rascals have shot my father, and I shall keep on shooting till I have killed every one of them ! \" This he said to two or three other messengers, and he did not desist till Sevier himself rode up to him. Then the boy threw away his rifle, and in a"], [280, "260 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. transport of joy embraced his father, whom he had thought killed by the Tories. He had been misled by the report of the fall of his uncle Robert. On that blood-stained hill there lay, when night fell upon the carnage, two hundred and twenty-five British dead, and one hundred and eighty-five more or less se verely wounded. Of the corps of regulars only twenty were left fit for duty. All the rest of Ferguson's com mand, some seven hundred, were prisoners. Not a man escaped. The American loss was only twenty-eight killed and sixty wounded ; but among the killed were the brave Colonel Williams, and Major Chronicle and Captain Mattocks, whose knowledge of the ground had contributed so largely to the success of the battle. Rob ert Sevier died on the march homeward. The disparity of the British and American loss is partly accounted for by the fact that down-hill firing overshoots the mark. This was understood by Putnam and Stark, who, at Bunker Hill, told their men to \" aim at their waist bands.\" The great disproportion of British killed to their wounded shows the wonderful accuracy of the backwoods rifle. Thirty-seven killed is the usual ratio to one hundred and eighty-five more or less injured, instead of which the British death-roll on this bloody field ran up to an excess of forty above the wounded. It was a remarkable battle. If we take no account of the small numbers engaged, and consider only the valor displayed, and the results that followed, it must be classed as one of the most notable conflicts in American"], [281, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 261 history. The British fought as well as Britons ever fought \u2014 which is saying that they showed all the bravery of which man is supposed to be capable. Their leader, too, displayed not only valor and skill, but an indomitable will and exalted heroism. All through the fight he was everywhere, animating his men, and, so long as he lived, they might be shot down, but they could not be con quered. And he fell at last because he preferred death to surrender. But he fought against Sevier and Shelby, men as heroic as he, and actuated by far higher motives. With him it was love dt glory, and loyalty to his king ; with them love of freedom, and fidelity to the rights of man : and so, in the long ages that are com ing, when kings and kingcraft shall have perished from the earth, Ferguson will be accounted a brave soldier, but Sevier and Shelby will be ranked among the heroes of the race \u2014 and so will the unnamed nine hundred who, on that bloody day, faint with hunger, and weary with hard riding, marched so steadily upon those British bayonets. One of them received what was thought to be a mortal wound in the abdomen, but his life was saved because he had not tasted food for forty-eight hours ! Said Sevier when he was an old man, and the country on the eve of a second war with Great Britain : \" I was then ready to hazard everything dear to man to secure our independence. I am now as will ing to risk all to retain it.\" It was this spirit that conquered at King's Mountain. A terrible night followed the terrible day of the"], [282, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 262 battle. The cold was intense, and a strong wind swept across the mountain. The wounded lay around where they had fallen, upon the bare ground, among the un buried dead, with no shelter but the gray sky above them. There were no splints for their shattered limbs, no bandages for their flowing wounds, and only one surgeon among the entire two hundred and fifty. Said one who witnessed it, \"The scene was heart-rending in the extreme \u2014 the groans of the dying, and the constant cry of the wounded for ' water ! water ! ' \" The seven hundred prisoners were huddled together in a narrow space, guarded by a handful of patriots, exhausted by long fasting, and far more weary than their captives. Near by were stacked fifteen hundred captured mus kets, which a desperate rush would enable them to re gain, and momently the patriot leaders expected to hear the distant tread of the seven hundred Tories under Moore and Gibbs, and the invincible legion of Tarleton. Overpowered by hunger and fatigue, some of the men slept, but no sleep came to the eyes of the leaders. They knew that even a more desperate battle might be before them ; and so would it have been had not Fer guson's dispatches been delayed and intercepted, and had not, too, the names of Sevier and Shelby struck a whole some terror into the hearts of the surrounding Tories. But the dismal night wore away at last, and the sun arose upon the bloody field of King's Mountain. Never before on this earth did its rising meet a more grateful welcome. As its first beams chased away the shadows"], [283, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 263 of the night, they sent down into the hearts of the weary patriots new strength and courage. It is probable that only one man among them had even a dim foresight of the great results which were to follow the day's conflict, and now as he moved about among the tired men there was in his eye the steady gleam of assured triumph. He told them the tide had turned, the spell of British invincibility had been broken. Henceforth there might be battles, but every battle would be a victory. So the men arose and made ready for the weary march homeward. The captured arms were loaded upon the shoulders of the prisoners, hasty litters were prepared for the badly wounded, and at ten o'clock in the morn ing they set out on their march, leaving Campbell and a small squad behind to bury the dead upon the mount ain. Encumbered as they were with wounded, and them selves scarcely able to drag one foot after another, it was nearly night before they reached a deserted planta tion only twelve miles from the field of battle. Here they found an abundance of dry rails for their camp fires, and a patch of sweet-potatoes large enough to give them all the much-needed rations. While regaling themselves upon this simple fare, they were joined by the force they had left behind on their hurried march to the battle. They had with them a few cattle, and these were added to the frugal repast of their half famished comrades. Thereafter, for several days, the progress of the troops was painfully slow. At the end of a week they had"], [284, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 264 gone no farther west than Bickerstaff's, a place about nine miles northeast of the present town of Rutherford, and only forty miles from the field of battle. They numbered now, including prisoners and wounded, not far from twenty-five hundred men, and being in a sparse ly settled region, which had been stripped bare by the recent march of Ferguson's forces, they suffered much for want of provisions. For two entire days they marched without any food whatever \u2014 not an ear of corn, nor a solitary sweet-potato. At Bickerstaff's they secured a meager supply, and here occurred a scene which exhibits the deplorable animosity that then existed between the patriot and Tory elements in this section. \"The battle of Camden,\" says General Preston, \"had made Cornwallis complete master of South Carolina. This power he was using with cruelty unparalleled in modern civilized con quest ; binding down the conquered people like male factors, regarding each rebel as a condemned criminal, and checking every murmur, answering every suspicion, with the sword and the fire-brand. If a suspected Whig fled from his house to escape the insult, the scourge, or the rope, the myrmidons of Ferguson and Tarleton burned it down, and ravished his wife and daughters ; if a son refused to betray his parent, he was hanged like a dog ; if a wife refused to tell the hiding-place of her husband, she was impaled by the butcher-knife of the Tory ; and to add double horror and infamy to the deep damnation of such deeds, Americans were forced to be the instruments for perpetrating them."], [285, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 265 That which Tarleton was ashamed to do, he had done by Americans \u2014 neighbors, kinsmen of his victims.\" While Sevier and Shelby were on the march to King's Mount ain, the monster Browne had executed thirty of Clarke's soldiers at Augusta with circumstances of savage torture ; and now at Bickerstaff's the over-mountain men heard that Cruger at Ninety-six had, only a day or two before, hanged eleven men for no other crime than being patriots. The tidings exasperated Campbell and Cleveland beyond expression. They lived among Tories, and had come to regard them as wild beasts, that are to be slain on sight, and without warning. They had now, they said, upward of thirty of these Tory leaders among their prisoners \u2014 men stained with every crime \u2014 and they de manded that they should be instantly tried, and, if found guilty, executed in retaliation for the British enormities. A court-martial of twelve field-officers was accord ingly convened, and, says Shelby, \"thirty-six men were tried, and found guilty of breaking open houses, killing the men, turning the women and children out-of-doors, and burning the houses. \" The court was convened late in the day, and it was far into the night when the trial of the whole number was concluded. The proceedings were conducted with order and decorum. Witnesses were duly examined, and the charges against each man were fully proved before the sentence was passed upon him \u2014 instant death by hanging. Among those arraigned to answer for their lives were Crawford and Chambers, the two of Sevier's men who had 12"], [286, "266 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. deserted on the second day from Watauga, and warned Ferguson of the approach of the over-mountain men. Their treachery had occasioned the long and terrible march, the uncertain fight with superior numbers, and all the suffering and privation which the half-famished patriots had endured since leaving Gilbert Town. Ii events had followed their natural order \u2014 if what we mis name \"chance\" had not interposed to delay the British leader \u2014 their act would have brought disaster upon the expedition, and consigned, perhaps, every one of the patriots to the gallows or a British prison. If crime were to be estimated by its consequences, theirs was of a deeper dye than that of Andre, who, only twelve days before, had been sent to the gallows by Washington. The men composing the court were of iron mold, stern and inflexible, and yet justice with them was tempered with mercy. Chambers was but a stripling, and it soon became apparent that he had been led away by his older comrade, Crawford. This appearing, he was instantly pardoned, but the man Crawford was as prompt ly sentenced to immediate execution. Then ensued an incident such as, so far as I know, never occurred in a court of justice, not even in one organized as a drum head court-martial. It was related to me by Dr. Ram sey, who had it in detail from George Washington Se vier, a younger son of the general. Sevier was not a member of the court \u2014 he had no heart for such work \u2014 but he was present at the pro ceedings. When sentence of death had been passed"], [287, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 267 upon Crawford, he asked that the criminal might be given up to him, he being a member of his regiment. Being questioned by one of the court as to what he would do with the man, Sevier replied, \"I shall let him go, for he has a wife and children. \" So had nearly all of the patriots, was the answer, and Crawford might have made every one of their wives a widow. Not one among the condemned was a greater criminal. This Sevier admitted, still he thought Crawford had not fully realized the consequences of his action. However, Provi dence had overruled his wrong-doing, and given them the victory. He did not wish his share in it to be stained by the blood of a neighbor. This man belonged to him, for he was from over the mountain. Therefore, he asked his life, and he would be responsible for his good con duct in future. So the man was given up to Sevier, and ever after ward was a true patriot and a worthy citizen. It was by acts like this that Sevier knit men to him by bands stronger than those welded of iron. It was not his splendid abilities, but his great loving-kindness, his tender regard for even the wayward and the criminal, that won for him, during forty-five years, such unwa vering devotion as has never been bestowed on any other public man in this country. Crawford being liberated, the other condemned men were led out to execution. It was the 14th of October. The night was cold and dark. Thick clouds overhung the sky, presaging the storm that was to burst upon"], [288, "268 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. them on the morrow. There was neither moon nor star, but hundreds of pine-torches cast a lurid glow over all the surrounding forest. A great tree, which for years afterward was known as the Gallows-Oak, stood near the road-side. Beneath it a rude scaffold had been erected, and from one of its huge limbs a stout rope was dangling. There, three by three, those thirty-five souls were to be launched into the great future. Not one of them was thought fit to live in this world \u2014 God pity them if they should be found unfit to live in any other ! Three by three they were marched out, surrounded by guards four deep, their rifles at the half trigger. Near by sat the twelve officers of the court on horseback, and standing around were not less than a thousand riflemen, each one intent upon seeing justice done upon the oppressors of their compatriots. Every man had his rifle in hand ; so to those thirty-five hap less souls there was no chance of escape, no hope of re prieve \u2014 to all human appearance their doom was abso lutely fixed and certain. They felt it to be so, and, to do them justice, they were ready to meet their fate like men ; they went to the scaffold with as firm a tread as ever a soldier went to battle. So nine of them stepped from this world into that dim, uncertain realm which we call eternity. Among them were the miscreant Grimes, who had been driven out from Watauga, and other Tory leaders, at the bare recital of whose deeds the blood, even now, runs cold with horror. In the fourth trio now about to be led to execution"], [289, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 269 was a Tory named Baldwin, a man steeped in crime, but who had a trace of goodness in him, or he could not have won the devoted affection of a brother too young to know much of this world's wickedness. This lad, a mere stripling, had come to say a final farewell ; and now as the condemned man was about to be led to the scaffold, the youth threw himself upon him with a burst of pas sionate grief that melted the hearts of the by-standers. It seemed that only force could separate the two, and to this the guard hesitated to resort. This hesitation gave the lad more time to indulge his frantic grief, and \u2014 to cut the cords that bound his brother. This done, he suddenly relaxed his embrace, and, as suddenly the condemned man leaped through the cordon of guards, and bounded away into the forest. A thousand rifles covered him, every one of which could bring down a bird flying, but not one was raised to arrest the fugitive. Admiration for the daring of the boy stayed their hands, and softer feelings than those which spring from a stern sense of retributive justice took possession of the assem bled riflemen. The executions had taken place near the encamp ment of Sevier, and he and Shelby stood together not far from the Gallows-Oak when this scene was enacted. They observed its effect upon the men, and saw that advantage could be taken of it to stop the summary proceedings. The men no longer thirsted for vengeance, but were open to feelings more akin to humanity. More over, nine lives would, as well as thirty-five, assure Corn-"], [290, "270 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. wallis and the Tories that further atrocities would meet with a sure retaliation. As they said this to each other, one of the officers of the court complained loudly to the guard of the momentary delay, and commanded them, with great oaths, to go on more rapidly with the executions. This same officer had been attacked with \"stage-fright\" toward the close of the action at King's Mountain, and had apologized to Shelby for it on the day following the battle. Sevier regarded him now intently for a moment, then with a smile that was peculiar to him, said, \" Why, colonel, if we all had been as much in earnest in the action, more would have been killed, and fewer left to be hanged.\" More abruptly, and with less courtesy, Shelby added : \"This work must stop. We have talked it over, and it must stop. There has been enough of it.\" The opposition of these two men did that which, half an hour before, had seemed to be impossible \u2014 it saved the lives of the twenty-five con demned Tories. But the execution of the nine had its intended effect. Thereafter no more patriots were hanged in the Carolinas. About two o'clock on the following morning, one of the condemned Tories came to Shelby, where he was asleep under a tree. \"You have saved my life,\" he said to him, \"and I will tell you a secret. Tarleton will be here in the morning ! A woman has brought us the news.\" The information was possibly not correct, but pru dence required that it should be acted upon. At any"], [291, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 271 other time it would have been welcome tidings to the patriots ; but now, jaded with a long march, half fam ished, and encumbered with a host of prisoners and wounded, they were in no condition to meet an onset from the impetuous troop of Tarleton. They had for days expected an attack, and had made dispositions to meet it ; and it is possible that, if the British leader had overtaken them, the desperate energy with which they would have fought might have brought upon him a like disaster to that which soon afterward befell him at the Cowpens. But the patriots would have fought at great disadvantage, and they prudently resolved to avoid an engagement. This could be done only by a forced march of thirty-two miles to the ford of the Catawba at Quaker Meadows. This course being decided upon, before the dawn of day the little army was set in motion. The badly wounded were conveyed to secluded retreats in the mountains, the convalescent were mounted on the horses of their comrades, and the weary troop took up their toilsome way, over a broken and hilly country, and a rough and stony road, impassable except for horse and foot-passengers. Not a pound of provisions was in the camp at starting, and not a soul in the cavalcade \u2014 offi cers or men, prisoners or wounded \u2014 tasted food during the weary march of twenty-four hours that followed. It was not long before they were overtaken by the storm which the previous night had foretold. The rain began to fall shortly after daybreak, and soon it came down"], [292, "272 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. in torrents. But this only hastened their movements, for it foreboded a freshet in the rivers, and their safety depended upon reaching the Catawba while it was still fordable. So, all through the day, and far into a cold and dismal night, they marched, the mud up to their knees, and often losing their way in the woods ; but at last, worn out with fatigue and fasting, and every one of them, from the leaders to the meanest private, \"as wet as if he had been dragged through the Catawba,\" they arrived at the bank of that river. It was two o'clock in the morning, intensely dark, and the Catawba was breast-high and rapidly rising ; but they plunged at once into the rushing stream, and every man of them reached the opposite shore in safety. In three more hours the river had risen far beyond its banks, and for many days it was an impassable barrier between the patriots and any pursuit from Tarleton. But, strange as it may seem, while the patriots were thus retreating from the British, Tarleton and Corn wallis were fleeing from them, quite as rapidly, and in a much more disorderly manner. The panic which seized upon the British commander was the first fruits of the battle of King's Mountain. And yet the tidings brought by the condemned Tory to Shelby were sub stantially true. Not hearing from Ferguson, and in total ignorance of his fate, Cornwallis, on the morning of the 10th \u2014 three days after the King's Mountain battle \u2014 dis patched Tarleton, with a strong body of horse and artil lery, to find Ferguson, and aid him in exterminating the"], [293, "KING'S MOUNTAIN. 273 rebels from over the mountains. Tarleton marched that day twenty miles on the direct route of the patriots, and, had he continued the pursuit, would have come up with them on the morning that information of his move ments came to Shelby. But at his first night's encamp ment he was overtaken by a messenger from Cornwallis, recalling him at once to headquarters. Soon after Tarleton had set out, the British com mander learned, from a \" venerable Whig \" in whom he had confidence, of the total defeat of Ferguson by the over-mountain men, who then, he was told, three thou sand strong, flushed with victory, and daily re-enforced by the patriots of Mecklenburg County, were marching to attack him in his headquarters. During the day this information was confirmed, and Cornwallis suddenly re solved to turn his back upon this new enemy, who had thus unexpectedly descended upon him from the mount ains. With Tarleton detached, and Ferguson destroyed, he thought himself in no condition to meet such a foe as rumor pictured the over-mountain men \u2014 a horde of giants, fearless of danger, enamored of fight, deadly sure with the rifle, clad in the Indian hunting-shirt, and, like the Indians, rushing into battle with an unearthly yell which sent a strange paralysis through the frame, and froze the heart of the bravest stock-still with horror. These were not the soldiers Cornwallis came out to fight ; so, recalling Tarleton, he began a hasty and disastrous retreat toward Charleston. I need not recount the rest, for it is well-known history."], [294, "274 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. The British power in the colonies was broken at King's Mountain. \" That glorious victory,\" said Jeffer son, \"was the joyful annunciation of that turn in the tide of success which terminated the Revolutionary War with the seal of independence.\" And it was more than a \"turn in the tide\" \u2014 it was the cause, the active force which set in motion the train of great events that fol lowed. To it may be directly traced Blackstocks, Cow pens, Guilford, Eutaw, and the crowning victory of York town. And this victory, so pregnant with great results, was won by men who rushed spontaneously to the rescue of their country. They acted without orders, without pay, without hope of reward, and did not demand so much as the thanks of their government. Had they done so, they might have been disappointed ; for the greatest hero among them lies to-day in a far-away, un tended grave, overgrown with weeds, and unmarked by even a stone to tell his name to his passing country men."], [295, "CHAPTER XIII. AN INDIAN WAR. The object of the expedition being now accom plished, and the little army in absolute security, Sevier was at liberty to think of the poorly defended settlers he had left behind on the Watauga. He had been away twenty days ; six or eight more days must necessarily elapse before he could arrive at his home ; and, beyond a doubt, his absence would be no sooner known among the Cherokees than Oconostota would set his warriors in motion for a descent upon the settlements. This thought had often weighed upon his mind, on the long march and in the desperate battle ; but until now he could not leave his comrades without endangering the results of the expedition. It was therefore with a feel ing of intense relief that, on the morning after the ar rival of the patriots at Quaker Meadows, he saw the Ca tawba a broad and furious flood, totally impassable for either foot or horsemen. Giving his men only time enough to refresh themselves with food and rest, he called them all about him, and asked those who felt equal to a rapid homeward march to step a few paces forward. The movement was so general that Sevier was"], [296, "276 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. forced to make his own selection, and, choosing about a hundred of the best-conditioned, he dispatched them at once, under Captain Russell, over the mountains. With the remainder of his own, and the most of Shelby's force, he was to follow as soon as the men were able to set out on the journey. Shelby himself was to re main with the prisoners till they were conducted to a place of security in Virginia. With Shelby continued about fifty of his own and Sevier's riflemen, who, enlist ing afterward with Morgan, came to share under Moses Shelby in the glory of defeating Tarleton at the Cow pens, and in the subsequent capture of Augusta, Georgia. Sevier would have given his weary troops a longer rest, but his impatience had infected them, and at two o'clock of that afternoon they set out on the march homeward. They arrived not an hour too soon, as Sevier learned when he alighted at the doorway of his home on the Nolichucky. Awaiting him there was Isaac Thomas, the Indian trader, who, with another trader named Har lin, had been sent forward by Nancy Ward to warn Se vier that the entire Creek and Cherokee nations were on the war-path, and about to move in strong force upon Watauga. Thomas had arrived several days before, and the tidings he brought had spread general alarm throughout the settlements. Leaving their dwellings and their garnered crops, the more remote of the set tlers had fled to the fort for protection. Major Charles Robertson had made the best dispositions for defense that were possible, but the cry everywhere was for Se-"], [297, "AN INDIAN WAR. 277 vier. \" When is Nolichucky Jack coming ? \" Without him there was fear, with him a sense of absolute security. So, sometimes, is one man stronger than a thousand. Sevier listened to the report of Thomas while he sat, travel-stained, and wearied with a long march, by a great wood-fire in the \"reception-room\" of his log dwelling. By his side was his young wife, and around him were his two manly boys, his brother Valentine, and several of his officers on the expedition. His brother Robert he had left behind on the march across Yellow Mount ain, and his dead body was even then being borne to a lonely grave on the banks of the Watauga. After lis tening to the report of Thomas, Sevier announced the necessity of setting out at once to meet the Cherokees. They must be checked before they reached the crossing of the French Broad River. Once there, they would break into small parties, and scatter havoc and burn ing throughout the settlements. With Russell's com mand, which had been refreshed by two days' rest, he would set out to meet the Indians as soon as \"Kate\" had given him a dinner. With that hundred he would hold the savages in check, till the rest of his men could come up with him ; but they should follow as soon as men and horses had a few days' rest and refreshment. Thus, with scarcely an hour's delay, and after twenty eight days of hard riding, Sevier sprang again into the saddle, and with only a hundred men went forth to meet a thousand. All night they marched, and on the evening of the second day went into camp on Long"], [298, "278 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. Creek, not far from the crossing of the French Broad River. They were on the great Indian war-path, which route the Indians would naturally take ; but as yet they had seen no trace of the savages. However, the settle ments were now safely behind them, and they could proceed with less haste and more caution. As they went into camp at nightfall, they sent forward a small party to reconnoitre. On ascending a slight knoll at a short distance, the little force of twenty came sud denly upon a thousand savages. Without stopping to dismount, they fired upon the Indians ; then, turning their horses' heads, they rode rapidly back to the en campment. Sevier at once put his men into position for a night attack, and thus they lay on their arms till the morning, expecting every moment to hear the war whoop of the savages. Before daybreak they were joined by seventy of the men who had been left behind on the Nolichucky. Worn and weary as they were, these men had clamored to be led to the help of their beloved commander. Thus re-enforced, Sevier advanced in the morning to meet the enemy. He moved cautiously, with scouts in front, and outliers on both flanks, but he marched all day without encountering an enemy. A dead Indian was found at the spot where the advance had come upon them on the previous evening, and this showed that the savages had retreated in haste and disorder, for their in variable custom was to bear off their killed and wounded. Here were found traces of a body numbering not less"], [299, "AN INDIAN WAR. 279 than a thousand. Their spies had, no doubt, discov ered Sevier's re-enforcement of the night before, and its numbers, magnified by their fears, had led their main body to fall hastily back to a position better fitted for an ambuscade. This Sevier conjectured, and he also now knew their strength, but he pressed more vigorously for ward. Crossing the French Broad at what is now known as Sevier's Island, he went into camp on Boyd's Creek, where was shed the first blood that Watauga offered up in the Revolution. Here the men slept again on their arms, momently expecting an attack, but the night wore away without any demonstration from the Indians. Soon after daybreak the little army was again iu motion. Sevier rode with the advance-guard, which, at the distance of three miles, came upon the deserted camp of the Indians, their fires not yet extinguished. Giving orders that his men should form in three divisions, the right wing under Major Walton, the left under Major Jonathan Tipton, the center to be led by himself, he galloped forward with a small party to unearth the enemy, and draw them on to an attack. He had gone but three fourths of a mile when he came upon the Indians, concealed in the tall grass, and formed in a half-moon, evidently with the intention to inclose his little army. He was on the alert, but the hasty firing of a few braves fully disclosed their position. Giving his little party directions to fire, and then to retreat slowly, loading and firing, he galloped rapidly back to the main"], [300, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 280 body. To them he gave orders which, had they been fully executed, would have enveloped and destroyed the enemy. The right wing was to wheel to the left, the left wing to the right, while he, with the center, met the onset of the savages. Thus exposed to a triple fire, the Indians must have suffered terribly, and, if they did not overpower the whites by sheer force of numbers, few of them would be left to carry the tidings of defeat back to Chickamauga. As was expected, the Indians rushed rapidly forward in pursuit of the decoy party till their advance was checked by a terrible fire from the center under Sevier. Then Walton wheeled to the left, with as much precision as if on parade, and the left wing attempted the same movement ; but at this moment Tipton, who had fought bravely by the side of Sevier at King's Mountain, fell, badly wounded. This disconcerted his men and de layed the movement, and now the Indians, mowed down by Sevier's fire and seeing they were likely to be surrounded, were seized with sudden panic, and broke through the gap in front of the left wing, fleeing wildly across a swamp which lined the banks of the streamlet. Instantly Sevier ordered a charge, and his men, spring ing upon their horses, plunged into the morass, their leader in the advance. He had emptied his pistols upon the fleeing savages, when he came close upon a stalwart warrior, who, seeing he was about to be overtaken, turned and fired at him from a distance of not more than ten paces. The ball grazed Sevier's temple and"], [301, "AN INDIAN WAR. 281 cut away a lock of his hair, but, spurring his horse for ward, he raised his sword and aimed a heavy blow at the Indian. The savage parried the stroke with his rifle, and a desperate encounter followed with sword and gun barrel. It was a contest of agility and skill with im mense strength and brute bravery, and for a few moments the issue seemed doubtful ; but, at length, one of Sevier's men, coming up, leveled his rifle and dispatched the Indian. Dragging Canoe was not personally known among the whites. His visits to them had been at night, and they had seen his features only at long range of a rifle, when they were not easily distinguished. But Indians subse quently captured affirmed that the warrior now killed was none other than the ferocious chieftain of the Chick amaugas. It is certain that from this date he disappears from border history. If this were he, then this most implacable foe of the whites met his fate on the very spot where he had shed the first blood of the settlers. The Indians scattered among the adjacent woods and hills, where they could not be pursued by cavalry. They left twenty-eight dead on the field, and carried away a large number of wounded. Of the whites not one was killed, and only Major Tipton and two others were se riously wounded. This result was due to the short con flict and the rapid fire of the backwoodsmen. Sevier was now between the settlements and the re treating Indians, and, the object of his rapid march being thus accomplished, he went into camp on Sevier's Island,"], [302, "282 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. to wait for his expected re-enforcements. With so small a force it was not deemed prudent to penetrate farther into the Indian country in the face of so large a body of the enemy, who at every step might receive additions to their numbers. However, it was not long before Se vier was joined by more of his own men from Watauga, a force of Backwater troops under Arthur Campbell, and a portion of Shelby's regiment under Major Martin \u2014 Shelby himself being still away with the King's Mount ain prisoners. The little army now numbered seven hundred, every man experienced in Indian warfare, and many of them tried in the furnace of King's Mountain. With such a force Sevier did not hesitate to push for ward into the Cherokee and Creek country, where he might be opposed by a force of ten times his own number \u2014 led, perhaps, by exasperated Tories and British officers. At Echota Sevier found a body of a thousand savages posted to defend the principal crossing of the Little Ten nessee ; but, passing over at a ford two miles below, he came suddenly upon their rear, and, without striking a blow, they fled to the mountains. The Indian towns thus left to their mercy, the troops began the work of destruction. For the sake of Nancy Ward, Echota was again spared, but every other village of the Ottari Chero kees was given to the flames. Their corn was burned, their cattle were destroyed, and not a solitary wigwam was left to shelter their wives and children from the win ter that was fast approaching. A like fate befell the villages along the Tellico and"], [303, "AN INDIAN WAR. 283 Hiwassee, and then Sevier pressed on to the Chicka mauga towns, near the present site of Chattanooga. The Tory and Indian banditti that herded together there fled, as he approached, to their secret haunts along the river, from which they soon beheld their crops and their homes going up in one wide conflagration, while the blood of their slaughtered cattle dyed red the Tennessee to the very mouth of the immense cavern in which they had concealed themselves. This done, Sevier pressed on again into the country of the Creeks. Going down the Coosa River into Georgia as far as the region of the long leaved pine and the cypress, his route was everywhere marked by blackened ruin and wide-spread devastation. Everywhere the Indians fled before him. A general panic had seized upon them. Only a few days before, they had heard that Nolichucky Jack was away, fighting the British in the Carolinas, and now he was applying the torch to their own dwellings ! The pale-faced chief was ubiquitous, and a conflict with him was a war with destiny. When his sword was once unsheathed, it drank Indian blood as the earth drinks rain \u2014 ever thirsty and never satisfied. And there was some truth in this, for the few men that were met were shot down without mercy. Only the women and children were taken pris oners. More than fifty towns were destroyed ; and the homes of over forty thousand people laid in ashes ! There was not a cultivated field in the whole of this Indian country that was not a scorched and smoking desolation. Not for years could the Creeks and Chero-"], [304, "284 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. kees recover from the wide-spread destruction. And yet the man who caused all this havoc was of a nature most kind and gentle and tender-hearted, the idol of his friends aud beloved by his very enemies. A terrible necessity impelled him. In no other way could he re duce the Indians to peace, or protect the homes and lives of the white settlers. The life of only one white man was lost on this ex pedition. It was that of Captain James Elliott, who had fought under Shelby at King's Mountain. He was shot by a concealed Indian when the troops first arrived on the Tellico, and his death served to inflame them to a more ruthless destruction. He was buried in an In dian hut, which was burned over his grave, that the Indians might not find and mutilate his body. After sixty-five days, Sevier returned to Echota, and from there issued an address to the Indians. The pa per bears unmistakable marks of his composition, but it is signed jointly by him and the two other leaders, Martin and Campbell. It was as follows : \" Chiefs and Warriors : We came into your coun try to fight your young men. We have killed many of them, and destroyed your towns. You know you began the war by listening to the bad counsels of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents. We are now satisfied with what is done, as it may convince your nation that we can distress you much at any time when you are so foolish as to engage in war against us."], [305, "AN INDIAN WAR. 285 If you desire peace, as we understand you do, we, out of pity to your women and children, are disposed to treat with you on that subject. \"We therefore send you this by one of your young men, who is our prisoner, to tell you that, if you are dis posed to make peace, six of your head men must come to our agent, Major Martin, at the Great Island, within two moons, so as to give him time to meet them with a flag guard, at the boundary-line on Holston River. To the wives and children of those men of your nation who pro tested against the war, if they are willing to take refuge at the Great Island until peace is restored, we will give a supply of provisions to keep them alive. \"Warriors, listen attentively! If we receive no an swer to this message until the time already mentioned expires, we shall then conclude that you intend to con tinue to be our enemies. We will then be compelled to send another strong force into your country, that will come prepared to remain in it and to take possession of it as a conquered country, without making you any com pensation.\" In answer to this address, a body of about two hundred Cherokees, among whom were Hanging Maw, John Watts, and Noonday, three of the principal Ottari chieftains, came, within a short time, into Echota. Through them a peace was made with the Ottari branch of the Cherokees, and an exchange of prisoners effected, by which numbers of white women and children were"], [306, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 286 restored to their homes after months and, in a few instances, years of captivity. These things done, the troops scattered to their homes, and Sevier returned to his farm on the Nolichucky. Arrived there, he learned that the General Assembly of North Carolina, at its first session after the defeat of Ferguson, had passed a resolu tion that a sword and pair of pistols shoidd be presented to both himself and Shelby, in testimony of the great services they had rendered the country. The swords were not delivered till 1813. The one given to Sevier was donated to the State by his son, George Washington Sevier, and it now hangs in the office of the Secretary of State in the Capitol at Nashville. On one side of it is engraved \u2014 \"State of North Carolina TO COLONEL JOHN SEVIER.\" On the other side is \u2014 \"King's Mountain, 7th October, 1780.\" At the same time Sevier received a commission from Governor Nash, of North Carolina, appointing him colo nel commandant of Washington County. Hitherto, for ten years, he had been commander by the universal suf frage of the people, and in virtue of his eminent quali fications for leadership. Commissioned colonels, much his seniors, had been content to serve under him, and his men had never failed to follow where he led ; hence"], [307, "AN INDIAN WAR. 287 it is not very clear of what particular value this com mission was to Sevier. With or without it, he had to serve without pay, and be his own commissary. More gratifying to him, doubtless, was a resolve of the General Assembly of the State, which was transmitted soon aft erward. It was dated February 13, 1781, and was as follows : \"Resolved, That Colonel Isaac Shelby, of Sullivan County, and John Sevier, Esq., of Washington County, be informed by this resolve, which shall be communi cated to them, that the General Assembly of this State are feelingly impressed with the very generous and patri otic services rendered by the inhabitants of the said coun ties, to which their influence has in a great degree con tributed. And it is earnestly urged that they would press a continuance of the same active exertion ; that the state of the country is such as to call forth its utmost powers immediately, iu order to preserve its freedom and independence.\" In communicating this resolve, the Governor drew a melancholy picture of the condition of seaboard Carolina. The Tories had again risen everywhere, and, banded to gether, were carrying blood and havoc into the homes of the patriots. Cornwallis was again advancing, and de tachments from his army were laying waste the most fertile and populous districts of the State. This being the condition of things, the Governor conjured Sevier and Shelby to rush again to the rescue of their distressed fel low-citizens. General Greene also wrote Sevier, remind-"], [308, "288 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. ing him of his glorious services at King's Mountain, and earnestly urging him to come to his aid with as many of his mountaineers as he could muster. These appeals fell on willing ears, but Sevier's hands were tied \u2014 his men had now again to defend their own firesides. However, he dispatched a small force under Charles Robertson to Greene, and they soon afterward gave a good account of themselves at Guilford Court-House. Had he been able to go himself with his whole force, it is possible that the disaster which overtook Cornwallis at Yorktown might have overwhelmed him at Guilford seven months pre viously. The picture which the Governor drew of the condi tion of the eastern counties was only too true. The anaconda had been scotched, not killed, by the defeat at King's Mountain and the terrible punishment inflicted by Sevier upon the Creeks and Cherokees. At Winns boro, after a disastrous retreat of a hundred miles, Corn wallis recovered from the panic which had overtaken him when he thought himself pursued by three thousand victorious over mountain men. There he learned that they had retired to their lairs beyond the Alleghanies, and, sending north for re-enforcements, he prepared to resume his fatal project of a march northward through the Carolinas and Virginia. Joined by General Leslie with fifteen hundred men, he had already put his army in motion, when he heard that Sevier was sweeping with a besom of destruction through the Indian country. But this in no way disheartened him. The misery of forty"], [309, "AN INDIAN WAR. 289 or fifty thousand half-clad savages did not lie very heavy upon his lordship's conscience. If the now famous over mountain leader could be kept where he was \u2014 prevented from descending upon his flank with his \"yelling devils \" \u2014 the march of Cornwallis might yet be triumphant, for Greene alone could not, he thought, offer any effectual resistance to his progress. It was, therefore, of prime importance to keep the over-mountain men busy at home with the Creeks and Cherokees. In this the agents of Cornwallis were helped by a division among the Indians. A strong party under the lead of Old Tassel, John Watts, Noonday, and Hang ing Maw, were in favor of observing the peace which had been agreed upon at Echota ; but a still stronger party, headed by the unconquerable old Oconostota, were violent for war till either they or the white settlers should be exterminated. They looked upon their ruined fields, their burned dwellings, and the new-made graves of their fallen braves, only to feel a keener thirst for vengeance, a deeper hatred of the accursed race who had encroached upon their hunting-grounds and desecrated the homes of their ancestors. True, Dragging Canoe was dead, but his spirit still lived among the Chicka maugas ; the country of the Ottari was devastated, but their warriors remained, well armed, and eager to meet the whites ; and, more than this, the homes of the Erati had never yet been invaded ; they had corn in plenty, and their twelve hundred warriors were burning to avenge the wrongs inflicted upon their brothers on the 13"], [310, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 290 other side of the Smoky Mountains. It was not diffi cult for the British agents to fan this inflammable mass into a flame. What was it to them if the simple savages should rush upon certain destruction ? What cared they, so long as they accomplished the object of the British general, to keep Sevier west of the mountains ? In this, for the entire summer of 1781, they were suc cessful. Sevier returned from the Boyd's Creek expedition in February, and early in March he discovered that there was to be no peace with the Cherokees. They did not appear in any large body, but small parties hung about the more remote settlements, descending upon some un guarded dwelling and whelming men, women, and chil dren in indiscriminate massacre. Instantly garrisons were stationed in the most exposed positions, and a cor don of light troops was placed all along the frontier. The wide extent of territory to be guarded involved the employment of so many of Sevier's men, that; \u2014 the detachment being still away with Greene \u2014 it would seem to have been impossible for him to muster a force strong enough for any important offensive operation. And yet, at this very time, he undertook and executed the most brilliant exploit in his history \u2014 one which, I think, has no parallel in the achievements of George Rogers Clark, or any other border soldier. He had become convinced that some of the recent raids had been perpetrated by the Erati Cherokees, who had their homes high up in the gorges of the Smoky Mountains, the gigantic range"], [311, "AN INDIAN WAR. 291 which is now the southwestern boundary between Ten nessee and North Carolina. These Indians were a body of bold, hardy mountaineers, twelve hundred strong, and their country was intrenched amid rocky fastnesses that were reported to be impregnable. Few white men had ever visited their stronghold, and those who had, re ported it unassailable by any civilized soldiery. By any route that could then be taken it was two hundred miles from Watauga, and the way to it was through trackless forests, across furious torrents and dangerous rivers, and over mountains, steep and rugged, and loftier than any east of the Mississippi. Only one white man at Watauga \u2014 Isaac Thomas \u2014 had ever entered this stronghold, and he had gone to it through the Indian country, on its south western side, from which it was always approached by its inhabitants. No Indian, no white trader or hunter, was known to have ever entered it from the eastern side, and of this region civilized man was as ignorant as of the interior of Africa It is to-day as wild a country as is anywhere to be found on this continent. But from this side Sevier determined to approach it, and with but one hundred and thirty men to storm this inaccessible posi tion, defended as it was by twelve hundred brave mount aineers. He took but one hundred and thirty, because not another man could be spared from the defense of the settlements. With Isaac Thomas as guide, he set out early in March, when the streams are at their highest and the snow still lies upon the upper slopes of the mount ains. I say with Isaac Thomas as guide, but Thomas"], [312, "292 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. knew nothing of the route ; he could only direct Sevier when they should have arrived in the enemy's country. So, with only a compass to direct his way, Sevier set out on his adventurous expedition. Crossing the Noli chucky near his home, he followed up the western bank of the French Broad, fording the river near what is now known as the Painted Rocks, and thence passing on to Warm Springs, which had been discovered by two hunt ers in 1778, but had not yet a single inhabitant. Here he climbed the banks of Laurel Run, and then, striking southward, ascended the Walnut Mountains \u2014 a trackless waste of rock and tangled forest, with not a path, nor a trail, nor even a trace blazed by a passing hunter. Thenceforward his way for more than a hundred miles lay through a wilderness, where human foot had scarcely trod, and man was so strange a sight that even the timid deer and wild rabbit came out from their coverts to gaze on the cavalcade as it passed. Over fallen trees and through matted underbrush the over-mountain men kept their way, now scaling some huge, slippery rock, and now floundering along some steep, stony ravine, where one false step of his horse might plunge the rider down headlong ; and at the end of twenty miles from Warm Springs they came to the Ivy, a mountain torrent then two hundred feet wide, and rushing to the French Broad with the speed of a fright ened animal. Its waters were too deep to ford, and the furious current would have appalled even the boldest swimmer ; but these skillful horsemen plunged fearlessly"], [313, "AN INDIAN WAR. 293 into the torrent, and, though swept nearly a thousand feet down the stream, gained the opposite bank in safety. Then their way lay through a less broken country, over gently rolling hills, gradually descending and slop ing southward \u2014 the home now of the fragrant \"golden leaf,\" of fame among tobacco-smokers. Till then the French Broad had been lined with inaccessible cliffs, but soon they came to sloping banks, along which they wound for another twenty miles till they arrived at the Swananoa \u2014 the river of the dancing waters \u2014 not far from the present town of Asheville. They were now in the latitude of the Erati, but sixty miles away as the bird flies, and, by the route they must pursue, all of a hun dred. Turning, therefore, their faces due west, they forded the Swananoa, and then the French Broad, and struck again into a never-trodden wilderness. For here, so far as is known, man had never been, nor any living thing save the beasts of the forest. And here again the wild creatures came out to meet them \u2014 the startled deer, the growling panther, and the surly bear ; the meat of which last, seasoned with the salt they carried in their knapsacks, was their favorite ration, varied only with parched-corn meal, sweetened with maple-sugar, of which a month's supply was slung across their saddles. By good fortune they soon struck an open gorge, trending westward \u2014 the Balsam Gap, through which now runs the road into this wild region. When not upon the Walnut Mountains they had hitherto trav ersed a country two thousand feet and more above the"], [314, "294 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. sea ; but now they were constantly ascending, till even the valleys were at an altitude of more than half a mile. The air here is clear and pure, and laden with all the odors of the forest, and the mountain-streams are limpid and cool, and sparkling in their purity. If man had only to minister to his physical needs, and to admire the beauties of his earthly habitation, this region would be the spot wherein to doze away existence. But Sevier had work in hand ; consciously or unconsciously, he was acting an important part in the great drama of human history, and, though this was but a minor act, he was intent upon the business before him. So, in the clear, unclouded sky of spring he climbed those rocky ways \u2014 twenty miles in a day \u2014 till, at noon of the tenth day from his leaving home, he came to Clingman's Dome, where it rose, a giant earthquake mound, right across his pathway. He had measured the distance by the speed of his horse, and now he felt sure that he was in the region of the Erati. In this view Thomas coincided, but the old woodman was at a loss for the bearing of the Indian towns. The question could be answered only by ascending the mountain, and from some opening along its slope, or the bald spot upon its summit, obtaining a view of the surrounding country. A peculiar feature of all these Smoky Mountains is these bald spots on their tops, where neither tree nor bush grows, but the soil is deep and the grass luxuriant. Ac cording to Indian tradition, they are the foot-prints of the Great Spirit of Evil, left when he has come to the"], [315, "AN INDIAN WAR. 295 earth, and strode from mountain-top to mountain-top in the darkness, the lightning, and the thunder. One may not see why his Satanic lordship needs go up so high to get a view of this world's wickedness ; but this he does, if Cherokee legend is to be trusted. The foot of man had never scaled Clingman's Dome, but Sevier determined to climb its wooded slopes to its very summit, where it soars aloft, gigantic, cloud-pierc ing, and higher than any peak but one among the Ap palachians ; and with broad vision looks down on all things not bounded by the rotundity of this planet. His horse, and the bulk of his men, he left at the base of the slope, and then, with Isaac Thomas and a half dozen others, Sevier slowly and on foot climbed the steep and lofty mountain. Its lower slopes are to this day clothed with majestic forests of cherry, walnut, and poplar ; but, as one goes up, these giant trees give way to the slender pine, the scrub-oak, and the gnarled beech, and, still higher up, the somber balsam, tapering a hundred and fifty feet toward the clouds. As it is now, so it was then, for the woodman had not then, nor has he yet, invaded these forest solitudes. These differ ent growths denote different degrees of temperature, and, when one is at the summit, he is in the climate of Canada. The little party set out about noon, but it was after nightfall when they had climbed to the top of the mountain. Midway up they came into a cloud, which drenched them like a fine rain ; but, when they arrived"], [316, "296 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. at the summit, the sky was clear, and the moon and stars were shining. They had ascended above the cloud, which now overhung earth and forest like a wide pall of inky blackness, shutting all below from their vision. The summit was carpeted with a deep, green sward, sprinkled with heather and rhododendron. I do not know that the idea occurred to them ; but once, in a similar position, it seemed to me that I was cut off from the earth, and floating almost alone on a green island through the infinite spaces of creation. It was not long before an occasional gleam lit up the cloud, followed by low, rumbling thunder. Soon the gleams became flash ing sheets of fire, zigzagging through the dense mass, and awaking echoes as loud as the explosion of a thousand parks of artillery. The first was the skirmish-fire, this last the discharges of warring battalions. Quicker and louder they grew, till the whole world below was in a fiery commotion \u2014 flash following flash, and each flash revealing a cloudy sea, in which the black mountain peaks around seemed like islands in some fearfully dis turbed ocean. At the height of the storm the cloud below was a rolling flame, casting a light like that of day upon the bare mountain-tops and the tall balsams that grew near their summits. These men had seen King's Mountain, its volleys of fire, and the sulphurous flame that girdled the hill in the crisis of the conflict ; but what was that, or any struggle of puny man, to this fearful battling of the elements ? If one would learn \"man's place in nature,\" he should witness some such"], [317, "AN INDIAN WAR. 297 storm from the summit of a high mountain, the world below wrapped in flame, and he standing, as it were, in the very presence of the Infinite. After a time the storm broke, the cloud fled away, and then these men, looking down, beheld the camp-fires of their comrades at the foot of the mountain. The men below were drenched with the storm, while the blankets of those above were as dry as if rain had never fallen. Wrapping these about them, they soon sauk into such sleep as is apt to follow hard riding. The morning sun disclosed to Sevier a scene of un paralleled magnificence. He was in a wilderness of mountains. Directly around him rose thirty-three peaks, all six thousand feet and more above the sea, and some of them several hundred feet higher than Mount Wash ington ; while farther away were the Black and Bald Mountains, the Blue Ridge, the Balsam, Cowee, and Nantihala ranges, and the tall Unakas, interspersed with lower ridges, and broken by deep valleys, and all bathed in a sea of green that shone in the sun like bur nished copper. For two hundred miles in every di rection the country was open to his vision. It lay at his feet in one vast forest-fringed panorama\u2014 a rolling ocean of verdure. Far away at the northeast, where the deep green of the woods melted into a misty purple, he could trace the courses of the Holston, the Watauga, and his own Nolichucky, and, nearer by, the silvery windings of the Tennessee as it rushed past the strong hold of the Chickamaugas."], [318, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 298 But the view at the south was the one which riveted Sevier's attention. There the Little Tennessee breaks through the mountains, in a broader flood, and amid deeper gorges, than those which have won for the region of the French Broad the name of being the most pictur esque in this country. This region is interlaced by ro mantic streams \u2014 the Oconalufta, the Tuckasege, and the Nantihala, and threaded by deep, secluded valleys, which are walled in by precipitous cliffs and precipices. Se vier knew these valleys to be the homes of the Erati, but his eye ranged in vain for any sign of life in all the wide, forest-covered region. At last he thought he de tected a slight haze, a thin mist, rising from the very base of the mountain on which he was standing. It seemed directly below him, but his experienced eye knew it to be miles away, and the smoke of an Indian village. Between it and him was the Welch Bald, a mountain a mile in height, but, that crossed on its lower slopes, he would be in the country of the enemy. Rapidly now Sevier descended the lofty Dome, and put his force in motion to pass the Welch Bald before nightfall. Its sides were so steep that the men were obliged to dismount and lead their horses, and in many places to almost drag them up the acclivities ; but, this obstacle surmounted, their way was less arduous. They went into camp for the night among the trees, but with the first streak of day were again in motion, and not long after noon stood upon the heights above the prin cipal Indian village of Tuckasege. Here noiselessly"], [319, "AN INDIAN WAR. 299 they tethered their horses, ate a hasty meal, and then, still more noiselessly, descended upon the Erati. The rest is soon told. Taken by surprise, the In dians made scarcely any resistance. Fifty of their war riors were slain on the spot, and a large number of women and children taken prisoners. The other war riors fled into the forest, and, scattering among the remaining villages, spread everywhere the tidings that \" 'Chucky Jack\" was among them ! A general panic en sued, and men, women, and children hid themselves in inaccessible haunts among the mountains, where they could not be followed. Then the torch was set to the Indian villages. Nearly twenty were burned, all the grain and cattle were destroyed, and the whole country was laid waste, and so left \u2014 a smoking desolation. Thus were these savages made to drink of the chalice they had held to the lips of the white settlers. This work done, Sevier returned by the way he came, with his prisoners. They would be of use to exchange for the whites who were held captive among the Indians. The expedition lasted twenty-nine days, and not a man upon it was either killed or wounded. This ruthless destruction broke the spirit of the Erati, and almost to a man they united with the peace party, which, under Old Tassel, was now making strong headway in the nation. Two thirds of the Cherokee warriors at once suspended hostilities ; but still, his old hatred fanned by the British agents, Oconostota held out, and with him the turbulent tribe of Chickamauga"], [320, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 300 outlaws. Afraid to meet the whites in the open field, they hung as usual about the more exposed settlements, and those to a large extent had to be abandoned by the settlers. Sevier patrolled every road and every by-path iu the territory, but he could not guard every detached farm-house. His men frequently routed small bodies of the Indians, neither asking nor giving quarter ; and one night in August, Sevier himself surrounded and exter minated a party of about twenty ; but no engagement of any consequence occurred during the season. It was a constant guerrilla warfare, in which Sevier's whole force was engaged, without rest, as well as without glory. At last, the Chickamaugas, tiring of continual defeat, drew off to their homes, and there sought solace in their misfortunes by making a scape-goat of the decrepit old Oconostota. They accused him to the nation of being the cause of all its disasters ; and, thus re-enforced, the peace party had no difficulty in dethroning the old king, and electing in his stead the moderate and peace-loving Old Tassel. Such was the inglorious fate of the ablest chief ever known among the Cherokees, who in his youth had been courted by George II, and for fifty years had held al most despotic sway over nearly ten thousand Creek and Cherokee warriors. For twenty years longer, without power or influence, he was to wander about, begging a measure of meal, or a gallon of whisky, from his \" white brothers,\" and then, a homeless, weak, besotted, and despised old man, he was to sink into the grave, seeing"], [321, "AN INDIAN WAR. 301 the entire subjugation of his country, and feeling that it had been brought about by his persistent folly in listen ing to the counsels of the Cabinet of Great Britain. The news of Oconostota's deposition came to Sevier early in September, and it was not many weeks afterward be fore he was again called by General Greene to the rescue of his countrymen on the other side of the mountains."], [322, "CHAPTER XIV. the final conflicts. When Shelby returned from escorting the King's Mountain prisoners into Virginia, he repaired at once, with his small force of over-mountain men, to the head quarters of General Gates at Hillsborough. Cornwallis had then suspended his retrograde movement, and was gathering his forces together at Winnsboro, in prepara tion for another march northward. His purpose was divined by Shelby, whose short service in South Caro lina had informed him that the region along the foot of the mountains was the very hot-bed of Toryism. If the people there were not overawed and restrained by the presence of a patriot force, they would flock in great numbers to the standard of Cornwallis, and thus swell his army, already too large to be withstood by any body the patriots could bring into the field. These views Shelby presented to Gates, and recommended to him the sending of a moderate force into that region. This was not at once done, on account of the depleted and dis organized condition of Gates's army, now reduced to barely fourteen hundred men ; but the suggestion was"], [323, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 303 acted upon by Greene when he assumed command early in November, ne dispatched General Morgan upon that service, and hence ensued the battle of the Cowpens \u2014 which was the echo to that of King's Mountain. In this battle, as I have said, Shelby's small force bore a part under his brother Moses ; but Shelby himself had previously repaired to Halifax, to take his seat in the General Assembly of North Carolina, to which he had shortly before been elected. His presence in the Legis lature explains his absence from the border operations of Sevier in the summer of 1781. Cornwallis moved northward, and early in September the combined French and American forces were closing down upon him at Yorktown and Gloucester. Greene had fought the battle of Eutaw, and driven the British commander, Stuart, back toward the seaboard ; and he was now apprehensive that Cornwallis would attempt to escape by a retrograde movement through North Carolina to Charleston, where, joined by Stuart, and further re-enforced by Sir Henry Clinton, he might protract the war indefinitely. At this time Greene wrote to Washington, \"I am trying to collect a body of militia to oppose Lord Cornwallis, should he attempt to escape.\" The militia he referred to were the over mountain men of Sevier and Shelby. To those leaders Greene had written on the 16th of September, urging them to come to him with all speed, and bringing as many riflemen as could be spared from the defense of the settlements. Owing to the dis-"], [324, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 304 turbed state of the region, Greene's messengers did not reach Sevier and Shelby till some weeks afterward ; but when they did, the patriot leaders at once issued a call for five hundred volunteers, and in a few days were on the march with them over the mountains to Char lotte. There they heard of the surrender of Cornwallis on the 19th of October. This seemed to them an end ing of the war, and they were about to return with their men homeward, when Greene proposed their join ing Marion in driving Stuart into Charleston. The lower couutry was being devastated by the British and Tories, and, with the over-mountain men added to his own force, Marion would be able to drive them back to the seaboard. There was no counting overnight upon the peaceable behavior of the Chickamaugas, and Sevier and Shelby were already two hundred miles from their homes. They were asked to go still farther away, and for an indefinite period ; but they consented, and joined Marion at Davis's Ferry, on the Santee, in No vember. The arrival of the over-mountain men gave Marion a splendid body of cavalry and mounted riflemen, and put him in condition to meet the British commander, who was none other than Captain (now Colonel) John Stuart, of the British Highlanders. Marion set his force at once in motion, and moved forward to the vicinity of the enemy, who was posted at a place called Fergu son's Swamp, on the great road to Charleston, and about twenty-five miles distant from that city. Here occurred"], [325, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 305 one of those exploits that were characteristic of Sevier and Shelby. They had heard of a body of Hessians, posted on the Charleston road, about ten miles in the rear of Stuart, who were in a state of mutiny. This force could probably be captured without much resist ance, and at once Sevier and Shelby asked the approval of Marion to an expedition for that purpose. With a body of about five hundred horsemen they set out in the early morning, and, making a wide detour through the woods to avoid Stuart, and riding rapidly, they came on the evening of the second day to a point on the Charleston road about two miles below the ene my's position. Here they lay on their arms overnight, and in the morning learned that the disaffected Hessians had been already marched off to Charleston. They were now between that place and Stuart, and on the line of his communications ; but he, with a greatly superior force, lay between them and Marion. Their main object had eluded them, but, not to return empty-handed, they determined, despite the danger of interference from Stu art, to assault and carry the British position. It was strongly intrenched, defended by an abattis, and a force of one hundred and fifty regulars, well supplied with arms and ammunition, and was said to be defensible against any force not supplied with artillery. Advancing upon the British position at break of day, Sevier and Shelby sent in a flag, demanding an uncon ditional surrender. The answer returned was that the place would be held to the last extremity. Time was"], [326, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 306 of great value, and it was better to secure a victory by negotiation than by fighting, so Shelby now went in him self, and made a second demand upon the British com mander. He told him that his force was composed of over-mountain men, who fought with knife and toma hawk, as well as rifle, and, if once their blood was up, they could not be restrained. If the commander was so foolhardy as to allow his post to be stormed, he must take the consequences. The officer then inquired if the Americans had any cannon. \"We have guns enough,\" answered Shelby, \" to blow you to atoms in a moment ! \" \"Then,\" said the officer, \" 1 suppose I must surrender.\" At the worst, he could have held out until Stuart's whole army was upon the little force of patriots, for Shelby's \"guns\" were all of rifle-caliber. The patriots took a large supply of muskets, and the entire garrison prisoners, and, setting fire to the buildings and abattis, they mounted the captured force behind them, and, without a moment's delay, set out to return to Marion. He was sixty miles away, but, again making a wide detour, they were in his camp at three o'clock on the following morning. They were closely pursued by Stuart, who, with his whole army, arrived within three miles of the American camp at sunrise \u2014 only three hours later than Sevier and Shelby. Marion was strongly posted in the rear of a swamp, and he de sired nothing so much as an attack from the British. Accordingly, he ordered Sevier and Shelby to advance to the edge of the swamp, and to begin the attack as"], [327, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 307 soon as the enemy appeared in force before them. But the enemy did not appear. Suddenly, without striking a blow, Stuart wheeled about and began a rapid and dis orderly retreat to the very gates of Charleston. From some prisoners who had escaped he had learned that the men now opposed to him were the \"yelling devils\" of King's Mountain, led by Sevier and Shelby. During five years these men had repeatedly balked his deeply concerted and wide-sweeping plan to subjugate the Southern colonies, and now their very names were to send him fleeing in disorder to his intrenchments at Charleston. The anaconda had been for some time dead ; but until now it had not been fully conscious that it had gone out of existence. This is the last that history has to do with John Stuart, of the British High landers. The British thus cooped up in Charleston, in Jan uary, 1782, Governor Rutledge convened the Legislature of the State, at a small town about thirty miles distant ; and thus, after two years of bayonet rule, civil govern ment was restored to South Carolina. This done, the work of the over-mountain men was accomplished, and they returned, \"through a deep snow,\" to their distant homes on the Holston and Watauga. On his arrival at the settlements, Sevier found affairs in a greatly disturbed condition. Large numbers of To ries, who had fled from the Carolinas, had taken refuge among the Chickamaugas, and were inciting them to re newed hostilities, and even among the better part of the"], [328, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 308 Cherokee nation there was a wide and serious dissatisfac tion. Settlers had followed in the wake of Sevier's ex peditions, and in considerable numbers had erected farm houses and inclosed fields within the limits of the Indian country. Against this the Cherokees protested loudly \u2014 loud enough to be heard by Governor Alexander Mar tin, five hundred miles away, over the mountains. This appears from a letter which the Governor addressed to Sevier from Danbury, on February 11, 1782. It was as follows : \" Colonel John Sevier. \" Sir : I am distressed with the repeated complaints of the Indians respecting the daily incursions of our people on their lands beyond the French Broad River. I beg you, sir, to prevent the injuries these savages justly complain of, who are constantly imploring the protection of the State, and appealing to its justice in vain. By interposing your influence on these, our unruly citizens, I think will have sufficient weight, with out going to extremities disgraceful to them and dis agreeable to the State. You will, therefore, please to warn these intruders off the lands reserved for the Indians by the late act of the Assembly ; that they re move immediately, at least by the middle of March, otherwise they will be drove off. If you find them still refractory at the above time, you will draw forth a body of your militia on horseback, and pull down their cabins and drive them off, laying aside every consideration of"], [329, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 309 their entreaties to the contrary. You will please to give me the earliest information of your proceedings.\" What heed Sevier gave to these orders of the Govern or does not appear from either record or tradition ; but it is probable that he bestowed upon them no attention. His view was that of Robertson, that \" Providence never intended that this rich and beautiful country should be given up to wild beasts and savages,\" and he may not have been overscrupulous about observing treaties that were daily broken by the Indians. Moreover, it is un likely that he would obey, from any source, orders to \"pull down their cabins,\" and expel from the fields they had planted, the very men who had shared with him the march, the bivouac, and the deadly onset of these same savages. Martin was Governor of North Carolina, but he had very little power beyond the Alle ghanies. There Sevier was autocrat, ruling by virtue of the hold he had upon the affections of the people. They loved him because of his loving-kindness to them ; and could it be expected that the man so mercifully kind as to forgive the deserter who had imperiled the lives of a thousand of his comrades, would now proceed against his old companions in arms at the head of \"a body of his militia on horseback\"? This view of Sevier's action, or rather inaction, is confirmed by a \"talk\" addressed by Old Tassel to Gov ernor Martin on the 25th of September, 1782\u2014 more than seven months later. It clearly shows that the settlers"], [330, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 310 had not been removed at that period. Old Tassel spoke, he said, \"for the whole nation,\" and in the presence \"of all the chiefs of the friendly towns, and a number of young men \" ; and in his appeal there is a certain pathos which leads us to pity \" the poor Indian,\" and to almost forget that one half of the Cherokees were the most bloodthirsty of villains. He said to the Governor : \" Brother, I am now going to speak to you. I hope you will listen to me. A string. I intended to come this fall and see you, but there was such confusion in our country, I thought it best for me to stay at home, and send my talks by our friend Colonel Martin, who promises to deliver them safe to you. We are a poor, distressed people, in great trouble, and we hope our elder brother will take pity on us and do us justice. Your people from Nolichucky are daily pushing us out of our lands. We have no place to hunt on. Your people have built houses within one day's walk of our towns. We don't want to quarrel with our elder brother ; we, therefore, hope our elder brother will not take our lands from us, that the Great Man above gave us. He made you and he made us ; we are all his children, and we hope our elder brother will take pity on us, and not take our lands from us \u2014 that our Father gave us \u2014 be cause he is stronger than we are. We are the first peo ple that ever lived on this land ; it is ours, and why will our elder brother take it from us ? It is true, some time past, the people over the great water persuaded some of our young men to do some mischief to our elder brother,"], [331, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 311 which our principal men were sorry for. But you, our elder brothers, came to our towns and took satisfaction, and then sent for us to come and treat with you, which we did. Then our elder brother promised to have the line run between us agreeably to the first treaty, and all that should be found over the line should be moved off. But it is not done yet. We have done nothing to offend our elder brother since the last treaty, and why should our elder brother want to quarrel with us ? We have sent to the Governor of Virginia on the same subject. We hope that, between you both, you will take pity on your younger brother, and send Colonel Sevier, who is a good man, to have all your people moved off our land.\" This message illustrates the universal trust reposed in Sevier, even by his enemies. The very savages whom he had fought almost constantly for six years, and whom he had only recently punished with appalling severity, now, in their day of trouble, turn to him and beseech that he may be sent to them, because he is \"a good man.\" It was, as I have said, this trait of large-hearted goodness, more than his other great qualities, that bound all men to Sevier, and enabled him to control so abso lutely the rude elements by which Providence was clear ing a way for civilization beyond the Alleghanies. But while Old Tassel was making these piteous ap peals to his elder brother, his own unruly children, the Chickamaugas, banded with hordes of desperate Tories, were raiding upon the whole frontier as far north as Virginia. The authorities of that State were at once"], [332, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 312 aroused, and speedily embodied a force to descend upon the Indian towns along the Tennessee. This force, sev eral hundred strong, rendezvoused at the Great Island of the Holston, and there waited for supplies and am munition. They waited till it was discovered that no supplies could be had, the State having no money in its treasury, and not enough credit to buy a pound of pow der or a flitch of bacon. Shelby was away in Kentucky, and therefore could not, as before, come to the rescue of the bankrupt Commonwealth. Hence, the expedition was abandoned. But Sevier's treasury was in a more flourishing con dition. Perhaps in all the territory there was not a hundred dollars of legal currency, but he and his rifle men had granaries full of corn, and with_ this \u2014 parched and ground and saturated with maple-sirup \u2014 they had gone on many a long march together. Seeing now that Virginia could not inflict deserved chastisement upon the Chickamaugas, Sevier took the work in hand him self, though compelled, by the necessity of leaving the settlements properly protected, to go into the enemy's country with a force which would be no more than a body-guard to a modern general. With but two hundred men he marched directly upon Echota. There he held a conference with Old Tassel and the Ottari chieftains, and so won their good-will that they not only laid aside their grievances, but gave him the escort of John Watts \u2014 afterward their head chieftain \u2014 to guide the lit tle army by the shortest and most direct route to the"], [333, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 313 Lookout towns on the Tennessee. But to this result Nancy Ward largely contributed. The Chickamaugas had given no heed to her counsels or commands, and it was therefore right, she thought, that they should feel the wrath of the Great Spirit. The friendship of the Ottari being thus secured, Se vier deemed it prudent to move with his slender force against the Chickamaugas. On the eighth day after set ting out from the Nolichucky he came to their towns, and laid one after another of them in ashes, the Indians fleeing as before to their hiding-places along the river, where, not knowing the way, he could not follow. This was true of all but a body of about five hundred Tories and savages, who, under their ferocious chiefs, Cate giskey, Big Fool, and Bloody Fellow, made a stand upon one of the upper slopes of Lookout Mountain, and there bade Sevier defiance. Crossing the broad river in the face of the enemy, he climbed the rugged mountain and at tacked and routed this banditti on the identical spot where, eighty years later, Hooker fought his famous \"battle above the clouds.\" Here his usual good fortune attended him. Not one of his men was killed, and only three were slightly wounded. The most remark able thing about all of Sevier's expeditions is the small number of casualties that befell his riflemen. In thirty four battles \u2014 large and small \u2014 which he fought with the Indians during a period of twenty years, his total loss was only six killed\u2014 a death-roll without a parallel in modern warfare. This result was due to the celerity of 14"], [334, "REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. 314 his movements and the impetuosity of his attacks, which always disconcerted, and thus rendered powerless the enemy.* This defeat subdued for a time the warlike spirit of the Chickamaugas, and soon afterward peace was pro claimed with Great Britain. Then the men of the rear guard returned to their homes, hung their rifles over their doorways, and went about the more peaceable employ ments of civilization. They had rendered great and vital services to their country. So far as I know, no other body of equal numbers ever achieved such great results in human history. They balked the deeply laid plans of the British Cabinet, backed by the whole pow er of the British Empire. This they did in 1776, when but a handful of two hundred, and again in 1780, when, only a thousand strong, they climbed the Alleghanies * I should hesitate to make this statement had I not for it the author ity of General Sevier himself. Among a large number of his letters, which have been most kindly furnished me by his great-granddaughter, the wife of the Hon. W. O'Neil Perkins, of Franklin, Tennessee, is one addressed by him to her grandfather, George Washington Sevier. It is dated February 20, 1814, and was written from Washington when Sevier was there as a member of Congress. In it he writes to his son : \" The accounts from General Jackson to Pinckney, of his last battles, have just arrived. He had twenty-five killed and seventy-five wounded, and says he killed two hundred of the enemy. After the first two actions he retreated to Fort Strother. There have been many brave men killed and wounded in the Creek campaign which might, by prudent conduct, have been avoided. These campaigns are very different from our former ones. In all mine the killed did not exceed six \u2014 a wide contrast indeed.\""], [335, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 315 and descended, a living avalanche, upon the British bayonets. And, in the closing crisis, they rushed once more to the front, and gave a final blow to the fleeing invaders. All this they did while their homes wrere encircled with savage fire \u2014 while the tomahawk was brandished above their heads, and the midnight torch was applied to their dwellings. They scaled untraveled heights, and waded the deep swamps of the seaboard ; and under the broiling sun of the Santee, and amid the snow-storms of the Alleghanies, in such hunger and thirst and weariness as human nature seldom endures, they everywhere sought and found and conquered the enemy. And, more than all this, while in hourly danger by day and by night, and beleaguered by foes in front and in rear, they planted civilization west of the Alleghanies, and in those untrodden forests hewed out a home for the uncounted millions who are to follow them. Though but a handful, they did a great work \u2014 a work that could not have been better done had they been a hundred thousand. For all this the men of the rear-guard deserve to be held in grateful remembrance by their country. The surrender of Cornwallis was the natural sequence to the battle of King's Mountain, and it broke the power of Great Britain over her revolted colonies. When the British prime minister, Lord North, heard of it, he threw up his arms like one who had received \"a ball in the breast,\" and exclaimed, as he paced wildly to and fro, \" 0 God ! it is all over ! \" It did, indeed, for the mo-"], [336, "316 REAR-GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION. ment, seem to be \" all over \" with the magnificent Brit ish Empire which had been builded by the elder Pitt. Five hundred million dollars had been added to its na tional debt, and it had lost three millions of its subjects, and the larger portion of its possessions in America ; while Ireland was in revolt, and the great powers of Europe were banded together for its destruction. It seemed about to sink from a vast world-power, girdling the globe, to an insignificant European kingdom, of no more influence or consequence in human affairs than the little German principality from which its monarchs had sprung. To the verge of this ruin it had been brought by its narrow-minded king, who, ruling by his own per verse will, had sought to obstruct civil progress, by shackling his subjects, at home and abroad, with an effete feudalism which the world had long outgrown. And George III would have given a death-blow to Eng land's power, had there not been an English people, and a younger and greater Pitt, to lift Britain up to even a higher summit of greatness. Reading now the past in the light cast on it by the present, we see that it had so to be, for not otherwise could England and the Eng lish race achieve their destiny, which is to carry freedom and civilization around the globe \u2014 a free-will offering to all the nations of the earth. But this work was to be done, not only by the ocean-girt nation, but by the Eng lish race, and the race was to be educated up to its high mission to mankind. Hence, an offshoot was severed from the parent trunk, and planted here, where it might"], [337, "THE FINAL CONFLICTS. 317 grow untrammeled by feudal ideas and kingly tradi tions \u2014 itself free, and therefore fit to be the apostle of freedom. This new growth was to overshadow this continent, but to strike its strongest roots into the rich virgin soil west of the Alleghanies. There was to be its home, the seat of its empire, the heart-center of its teeming millions. Hence it is that the work of these men \u2014 Sevier, and Shelby, and Robertson \u2014 the earlier portion of which I have here most imperfectly deline ated, was not of passing moment, but of lasting signifi cance \u2014 was pregnant with results which will be felt along the ages. Therefore, though obscure dwellers in the forest, doing their life-work in silence, seclusion, and all manner of untoward surroundings, they were im portant actors in the great drama that is being played out upon this planet. They were conscious of their high mission ; they felt that they were doing the behests of a higher than human wisdom ; and so they sought neither human reward nor human glory, and were con tent to go to their graves, leaving their work and their names scarcely so much as noticed in history. the end."], [338, ""], [339, "D, APPLETON & GO.'S PUBLICATIONS.

Contain ing Essays on the Characters of Lord Brougham and Sir Robert Peel, Bart., never before published in this country. With an Amer- ican Preface. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00. M A work that deserves to be widely and familiarly known. Its title, however, is so little suggestive of its real character, and is so certain to repel and mislead American readers, that some prefatory words may be useful for the correction of erroneous impressions. It is well knowu that the term 'Constitution,1 in its political sense, has very different significations iu England and in this country. With us it means a written instrument. The English have no such written docu ment. By the national Constitution they mean their actual social and political order\u2014 the whole body of laws, usages, and precedents, which have been in herited from former generations, and by which the practice of government is regulated. A work upon the English Constitution, therefore, brings us naturally to the direct consideration of the structure and practical working of English political institutions and social life. Mr. Bagehot is not so much a partisan or an advocate as a cool philosophical inquirer, with large knowledge, clear insight, independent opinions, and great freedom from the bias of what he terms 'that territorial sectarianism called patriotism.1 Taking up in succession the Cabinet, the Monarchy, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, he considers them in what may be called their dynamical inter-actions, and in relation to the habits, traditions, culture, and character of the English people.
