IH IIS Book is an attempt to describe. in a popular manner, the great landmarks of Scottish scenery in reference to the historical events with which they are con- nected, and the literary and lej^^aj^y associations of which they are the centre. In following* out this plan it was neces- sary to touch upon subjects such as the Stewarts, the Covenanters, the character of Burns. which, though different, have this in common\u2014 that they have been and still are matters of impassioned con troversy. The compilers have tried to treat such subjects in a strictly moderate manner, and to use, in a popular form, thc results of recent criticism. Whilst it is hoped that the volume may find some favour in the eyes of many who are interested in Scot land, it is, perhaps, specially suited for those whom some distance of space or time separates from North Britain, and to whom the features of Scottish scenery and Scottish life are matters of memory or tradition, not of experience. There are many omissions. The reader will under stand that the space of one volume was far too small for the full treatment, or even mention, of all the various objects that presented themselves. The com pilers take this opportunity of acknowledging the assistance they have received in passing this book through the press from Mr. C. W. Redin. It only remains to add that Articles 13 \u2014 15, 30 \u2014 38, 40\u201473, 97, 102 \u2014 110, and 114 inclusive, are the work of the author first mentioned below, and thc remainder of the volume of the second mentioned.

For, after all, in some measure the glory has departed from it, and, politically and socially, it is not what it once was. You cannot w7alk through it without feeling this. The Castle frowns over you from its grey height; for is it not turned into soldiers' barracks, and does not the crown, with many another ensign of royalty, rest within its walls, a thing for tourists to look at, and for historians to dream over ! Holyrood, once the scene of many a merry gathering, knows nothing of its old grandeur, scarcely recognising it even in the shows and levees of the \" Lord High Commissioner\" during the sittings of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: and the squalid courts ofthe Canongate and the grimy closes of the High-street tell only by carved doorways here, and chiselled coats-of-arms there, of the days that have been. Is it wonderful, then, that the children of this mother-city walk her streets with an air of dignity, as those who claim a long lineage and a grand history ? We cannot refrain from quoting here the beautiful lines of Sir Walter Scott : \u2014 \" Not here need my desponding rhyme Lament the ravages of time, As erst by Newark's riven towers, And Ettrick stripp'd of forest bowers. True, \u2014 Caledonia's Queen is changed, Since, on her dusky summit ranged, Within its steepy limits pent, By bulwarks, line, and battlement, And flanking towers, and laky flood, Guarded and garrison'd she stood, Denying entrance or resort, Save at each tall embattled port ; Above whose arch, suspended, hung Portcullis spiked with iron prong. That long is gone, \u2014 but not so long, Since, early closed and opening late, Jealous revolved the studded gate, Whose task from eve to morning tide, A wicket churlishly supplied. Stern, then, and steel-girt was thy brow, Dun-edin ! O how altered now, When safe amid thy mountain-court Thou sitt'st, like Empress at her sport, And liberal, unconfined, and free, Flinging thy white arms to the sea, For thy dark cloud, with umber'd bower, That hung o'er cliff and lake and tower, Thou gleam'st against the western ray Ten thousand lines of brighter day.\" But, unlike many cities which one could name, Edinburgh has not con tented herself with sitting in the dust and singing a Miserere over departed glories; accepting the fact that the old cannot come again, she has built a \" new town \" for her children on her northern side, and the gay and bright \u2014 shall we not say matchless ? \u2014 promenade of Princes street looks across its gardens (once the Nor' Loch) toward the ancient town, as if to challenge the complaint that \" the former days were better than these.\" And thus, in Edinburgh, old and new have come to stand face to face, the one beautiful even in decay, the other fresh and fair, to offer to many a quiet student studies in that law according to which \" the old order changeth, giving place The mention in these lines of \"Dun edin,\" however, recalls us to the more prosaic work of asking how Edinburgh got its name, a matter upon which anti quarians are considerably exercised, and upon which, therefore, we cannot do more than express a very hesitating opinion.

I^^^H^ONDON with all I her just boasts, I can I street I Princes Street I she has H\\ Regent Street, \u25a0:%rich gay | shops, and crowded in the season with endless carriages in mid- street, and countless men and women of high and would-be-high degree upon the pavement ; she has her Strand, trodden each day, perhaps, by more various \" sorts and conditions of men\" than any other street in Europe. But she has no street which men could be content day by day to tread \u2014 not for the sight of grand equipages and visions of nobs and snobs, and not for the sake of studying varieties of human face and figure, but \u2014 for its own sake : and this can be said of Princes- street Go along Regent-street or the Strand before the traffic is begun, why, it will seem as dull and uninteresting as a drawing-room when the company has gone, or as Brighton the day after an Easter Review. But Princes-street is always attractive, partly from its situa- tion, which looks across fair gardens to the high-built town of other days, \u2014 partly from its handsome buildings, partly from its facing the sun, partly from its length, which makes it the measure of a delightful promenade. Take these altogether to explain it, if you will ; for ourselves it seems as if there was some genius loci who was always there to make it pleasant. If we may choose our time, however, for a \" saunter,\" let us take the afternoon, and make our pro- menade of Princes-street about four o'clock. We shall then have the oppor tunity of seeing the citizens ; for from time immemorial, the ladies of Edin burgh and their beaux have taken their \"constitutional\" about this time; the numerous lawyers and bankers have left the court or the office for the day, and have strolled along hither to sniff the pure air, to see and to be seen, perhaps to smoke a cigar. Starting at the east end, we must tarry a moment or two to look around. Two large and handsome buildings are close by, the one the \" Register House,\" as it were, the \"Somerset House\" of Edin burgh ; the other the General Post Office, which might well be called the premature monument of the lamented Prince Con sort, who laid the foundation-stone in October, 1S61, only a few weeks before his death. The equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington, which stands in front of the Register House, may be said to mark, like the well-known \"Duke\" in the City of London, the centre from which or to which all the people are mov ing. Westwards omnibuses and cars are running \u2014 to Morningside, to Corstor phine, to Dunfermline ; eastwards they are making their way to Leith and Por tobello; southwards the coaches are starting for Dalkeith, Lasswade,Liberton, sometimes for some such far-off place as Lauder in Berwickshire. And within a few yards, on our left hand, is the Waverley Station, the centre of North British Railway traffic, which brings to \"Auld Reekie\" from far and near, dur ing the summer season, tourists, guide book in hand, ready to begin their Scottish tour. As we begin our walk our attention is arrested by some of these pilgrims who have just arrived perhaps fresh from London, young men with faint"], [21, "EDINBURGH\u2014 A WALK ALONG PRINCES- STREET. \u25a03 suspicion of beard and moustache, with fingers gorgeously beringed, and faces marked by that strange combination of smartness and intellectual slightness with which onegrows to be so familiar. You can see that they are patronising Edinburgh, and all of Edinburgh that pays them any attention is amused. They have got \"Scotch caps\" on, and have not yet had time to learn that even those elegant chimney-pots which they left in Zsisling ton would not have looked so strange as these Balmorals. Their talk is equally impressive: \u2014 \"Come, 'Arry, let's look at the guide-book ! ah ! \u2014 er \u2014 'ere's a monu ment ; ain't it a poor thing w7hen you think o' the Griffin and the Monument in Eastcheap ? Whose is it? Ah, it's Sir Walter Scott, him as w7rote them dry old novels that Miss Braddon has been making down into pennyworths for us.\" But enough of Harry and his brethren, for we have indeed come to the monu ment of Sir Walter Scott. It stands in theEastPrinces-street Gardens, and is the most elegant structure of its kind in Scot land, or, some partial admirer might ven ture to say, within the United Kingdom. Its style is Gothic, and the arches in the lower and more massive portion are so striking in their resemblance to certain portions of Melrose Abbey, as to have suggested to many the conjecture that the architect was full of Melrose Abbey when he formed his plan. In the various niches are placed statuettes of the chief characters celebrated in the Waverley novels ; and under the canopy sits Sir Walter himself, with his favourite dog, Maida, at his feet. Thus, like a father among his children, the old man sits among his creations ; historic figures and figures of romance, as real to us as if they were historic, are here to do him filial reverence, and to remind us that he, who left no son to bear his name, and founded no dynasty, has left behind him in the world of letters a dynasty more potent, and a \"house\" more cer tain of survival, than many a prince or noble could boast. There is something to us, too, in the general structure of this high pile, ending in a pinnacle 200 feet high, which impresses us with its wonderful truth to its subject. Broad at the foot, vaulted and groined, more slender in build and more delicate in tracery as it rises, ending at last in a pin nacle pointing heavenwards, it reminds one of the build of his best novels. They are generally broad and even massive in their beginning; gradually as the build ing rises, we are less conscious of breadth and massiveness, more ofthe endless in terest of detail, the beauty of figure, the play of fancy, and, last of all, we reach the top of the building in our contem plation, wondering at its exquisite com pleteness, and not seldom, it may be, looking away into that unseen world into which Sir Walter did not forget to gaze. The architect was one George Kemp; a young man for whom, had he lived, a great future had no doubt been in store ; but this one work was to be his one memorial, and he died soon after its completion in 1S44. The sculptor of the statue, an admirable work, was Sir John Steele. By a winding stair the tourist can reach the top, from which a fine view of the city is obtained; but as we purpose to look upon Edinburgh from Calton Hill, we shall not be tempted from our walk to go the giddy round of steps. We have not all heads so good as that sailor of whom one so often hears in Edinburgh, who, accustomed to the mast head, not only went to the highest gallery of the monument, but mounted the pin nacle and stood upon that \u2014 if we mistake not\u2014 upon one foot. But there is some thing at the base ofthe monument which interests us almost as much for the mo ment as any possible view from the top. It is this inscription placed upon a plate in the foundation-stone, from the pen of Lord Jeffrey : \u2014 \" This graven plate, deposited in the"], [22, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 14 base of a votive building on the fifteenth day of August, in the year of Christ 1840, and never likely to see the light again till all the surrounding structures are crumbled to dust by the decay of time, or by human or elemental violence, may then testify to a distant posterity that his countrymen began on that day to raise an effigy and architectural monument to the memory of Sir Walter Scott, Bart., whose admirable writings were then allowed to have given more delight and suggested better feeling to a larger class of readers in every rank of society than those of any other author, with the exception of Shakspeare alone, and which were therefore thought likely to be remembered long after this act of gratitude on the part of the first genera tion of his admirers should be forgotten.\" \" Christopher North,\" the friend of Wordsworth and Coleridge, of De Quin cey and of Scott; the other is that of Allan Ramsay, author of \" The Gentle Shepherd,\" \u2014 like Wilson, a poet, but with more ofa poet's fire, a man indeed of fine genius, the soft pastoral beauty of whose work lifted him into the fore most rank of Scottish song. But we have almost forgotten \u2014 in these dreams of departed greatness \u2014 that we are on Princes-street at the fashionable hour, and that living men and women are about us. The mid-street is full of carriages, cabs, and hansoms ; and the pavement is crow7ded with a more min gled mass of human beings. Now we meet, perhaps, several hearty-looking, well-fed, well-bred men walking arm-in arm \u2014 a fashion more possible than in Lon don \u2014 perchance an \"advocate\" who has done with his clients for the day, linked to some well-known local divine, who has spent the morning in his study, and comes out before dinner to meet his friends and talk of doings in kirk and state. Anon, it is a pair of straight-up, stiff-collared youths, not yet out of their teens, each with that appearance of hauteur which promises that the next generation of Edinburgh men is destined to be as proud as that which is passing away. Of couples there are many, \u2014 elderly merchants and their wives, young clerks and students with their sweet hearts, perhaps a new married pair here and there, marked out by their studied determination not to be noticed, who have come to Edinburgh to spend a part of their honeymoon. Of laughing school girls and hobbledehoy schoolboys there are not a few, just at the stage which a facetious friend describes as \" noticing,\" who have got their lessons over, and, half by stealth, have found their way to Princes-street to play at being men and women. We dare not speak of the dresses. The ladies are seldom gorgeous in their attire; good taste\u2014 even severe taste \u2014 is the law in On the one side of Scott's monument stands.atalittledistance, thebronze statue of David Livingstone, an explorer scarce less great in other regions than those of romance; on the other, we note, pro- ceeding westwards, another statue, also in bronze, to the memory of Mr. Adam Black \u2014 a man held in high esteem by his townsmen, and known throughout the world as thepublisher ofthe Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Still moving westwards, we are next arrested by two Grecian-looking buildings, stretching from the left of us to the foot of the Mound, as the hill is called on which stands the Old Town of Edinburgh \u2014 the Royal Institution, and the National Gallery of Paintings, of which we shall have more to say by-and-by. Enough to say that these imposing build- ings give, even to the passer-by, that suggestion of ancient Greece which reminds one of that vaunting title, \"Modern Athens,\" which is sometimes attached to it. On either side of the Royal Institution stand two more statues, one in East Princes-street Gardens, the other in the more select West Princes- street Gardens, which skirt the base of the castle-rock. The former is rfhat of John Wilson, far better known as"], [23, "EDINBURGH\u2014 A WALK ALONG PRINCES-STREET. 15 Hotel, with others scarcely falling behind it ; the clubs ; the art galleries, and the like ; and the little arcade, which has in it more of suggestion than achievement. We must not fail to speak, however, of the two churches, standing side by side at the very end of the street, upon the side of the Gardens, St. Cuthbert's or the \"West Kirk;\" and St. John's, one of the chief Episcopal places of worship in Edinburgh. They seem placed to gether by way of contrast, us if to illus- Edinburgh, and shovviness is regarded as manifest vulgarity. And thus it chances that, while at Brighton and many other places, more gaiety and grandeur far may be seen, you will not probably see a greater proportion of well-dressed people anywhere than here. What pleases us least is the average expression upon the people's faces. It is not pleasant; it is not genial. Many of these people will show that they have rich stores of wit and humour this very evening, as they min gle in their circle of friends : but they use all their arts to hide it, for the present, as a thingto be ashamed of.

This is an institution in Edinburgh, and a pleasant one. At length we come towards the end of our promenade. We have had to miss much as we have gone on, and time failed us to mark the beautiful shops on the street, the linendrapers', the jewellers', and the rest; the handsome Edinburgh people with the name of the late Dean Ramsay, known over the whole island through his delightful book of \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character;\" known also, and kept in cherished memory in his own city as a lover of good men, a patron of good works, and a perfect Christian gentle man. The parish of St. Cuthbert's is the largest in Edinburgh, and this brings to mind an amusing \u2014 and perhaps true \u2014 story. *A large number of \" cries,\" or marriage proclamations are made every"], [24, "16 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

Upon one last Sunday of April, or first Sunday of June, so the story goes, the session clerk began his \"cries\" about the usual time; at eleven o'clock the minister entered the church, but the clerk informed him that he had not nearly finished ; accordingly the minister sat down to wait until his turn should come; but a quarter-past eleven, half past eleven, twelve o'clock came, and still the interesting \"I publish the banns,\" etc., went on. At length it came to an end, but it was too late to begin a service, and the people were dismissed to digest at leisure the catalogue of names which had formed their morning's meditation. fine houses, its handsome hotels, its attractive shops, on the one side, and its fair gardens and monuments upon the other, and we dream of other days, and wonder what the ancient denizens of the Old Town would think of it all ; how the burghers of the day of Flodden would find their fears gainsaid, and would tune their tongues to some happier, if not finer, tune than the \" Flowers of the Forest;\" how Queen Mary would, perhaps, think her olden capital had become like the gay Paris which stole her heart; how John Knox, whom, with all his ruggedness, Scotland has never failed to venerate, would turn once more into restored St. Giles's to mourn per haps somewhat over \" sleeker times \" and \"smoother men,\" but, most of all, to make its walls ring again with brave words of truth and righteousness ; and how the old \"dean,\" whom Jenny Geddes so signally surprised, would find, not in the new Cathedral of St. Mary only, but even in the church of St. Giles's and elsewhere, things more to his liking.

Truth to tell we feel the air more pure and bracing about us here than down amongst the citizens of New Edinburgh ; and if any of these latter grumble at our saying so, we cannot help it. Here we are amongst greater men and so far in grander It was unhappily due to the many feuds which raged in Scotland between party and party that this noble building was destroyed in the year 1573. The unfortunate Mary was then, as all who are acquainted with Scottish history will remember, the centre around which the feuds revolved ; and the immediate cause ofthe attack upon Edinburgh Castle was the civil war which broke out between the adherents of Queen Mary and those of the \" King,\" i.e., of her own infant son James, in whose favour it had suited the ambition of a party to force the Queen to abdicate. This war had lin gered on through five weary years, when Queen Elizabeth, who took, as it were, a stepmotherly interest in Scottish affairs, thought the time had come for her inter ference. Let us hear the story as it is told by Sir Walter Scott in his \" Tales ofa Grandfather\" : \u2014 times ; and we are going to carry our readers back into the old days when Princes-street Gardens were a sheet of water, and the street itself was nowhere. The Castle stands 300 feet above the highest part ofthe new town, and about 383 above the sea; and the rock upon which it is built is so precipitous, that it is best to reach it by way of the Castle-hill, which is the continuation of the High-street, and the reader will for the present be good enough to take for granted that we have followed that route, and have now passed through the beau tiful Esplanade into the fortress itself. We shall take a general \" walk through \" first, and talk of the history of this castle. In its modern form it is not, after all, so very old, save in some small part. For it was destroyed almost to the foundation in 1572, and it is only by a figure of speech that we speak of it as identical with the old stronghold, the history of which carries us back into ancient times, and which is well described by Dr. Daniel Wilson as having been the \"nucleus around which the town has gradually risen.\" This, no doubt, was the famous \" After these hostilities had existed for about five years, the Duke of Chatelhe rault, and the Earl of Huntly, the two principal nobles who had supported the Queen's cause, submitted themselves to the King's authority, and to the sway of the Regent.

But Queen Elizabeth, who became now desirous of ending the Scottish dissen sions, sent Sir William Drury from Ber- wick with a considerable number [1,500] of regular forces, and, what was still more needful, a large train of artillery, which formed a close siege around the castle of Edinburgh. The garrison were,"], [27, "THE CASTLE OF EDINBURGH 19 however, much more distressed for pro visions than by the shot of the English batteries. It was not till after a valiant defence, in the course of which one ofthe springs w7hich supplied the fortress w'ith water was dried up, and the other became choked with ruins, that the gal lant Kirkaldy was compelled to capitu late. Having now in imagination w7andered about the old place and' talked a little about its past, let us come back again to the \"portcullis,\" and start from this point on our expedition to the various special points of interest. Here, first of all, just close by the gate, is the State-prison, which we are well enough pleased to pass under, not to enter. This prison has acquired an interest mainly from the remarkable men who have had their sadabode within its walls, \u2014 amongst them, as is supposed, the Marquess of Argyle and the Earl of Argyle, who were executed, the one in the reign of Charles II., the other in that of James II. ; and certainly many of the Pretender's fol lowers after their defeat in 1746, and Watt and Downie, two political offenders noteworthy in their time, in 1794. After a siege of thirty-three days he surrendered to the English general, who promised that his mistress should inter cede with the Regent for favourable treatment to the governor and his adhe rents. This might the rather have been ex pected, because Morton and Kirkaldy had been at one time great friends. But the Regent was earnest in demanding the life of his valorous opponent ; and Elizabeth, with little regard to her general's honour or her own, abandoned the prisoners to Morton's vengeance. Kirkaldy and his brother were publicly executed, to the great regret even of many of the King's party themselves. Maitland of Lething ton, more famed for talents than inte grity, despaired of obtaining mercy where none had been extended to Kir kaldy, and put a period to his existence by taking poison. Thus ended the civil wars of Queen Mary's reign, with the death ofthe bravest soldier, and of the ablest statesman, in Scotland; for such were Kirkaldy and Maitland. We pass onwards into the palace yard, and enter what is called the crown room, where are kept the Regalia, the crown, the sceptre, the sword of state, and my Lord Treasurer's rod. The story of the Regalia is a very interesting one. After the union ofthe English and Scottish Parliaments in 1707, these insignia, along with the treasurer's mace, were placed in a huge oaken chest, and put in the \"crown room,\" the window of which was secured by very strong gratings. The entrance to the room was also secured by two doors, one of iron, the other of oak, both being provided with the strongest pos sible bolts and locks. Some time after wards, since they were no longer ex hibited to public gaze, a panic arose, and it was freely hinted that in jealousy the Regalia had been removed to England. Even Arnot, the historian of Edinburgh, took up the cry, and insisted that if the officers of the Government and the Castle would not make inquiry whether the Regalia were in the Castle, the public would be \" entitled to con clude that they were not there.\" From the time of the surrender of Edinburgh Castle, 29th May, 1573, the Regent Morton was in complete posses sion of the supreme power in Scotland. As Queen Elizabeth had been his con stant friend during the civil wars, he ] aid devoted attention to her wishes when he became the undisputed ruler of the kingdom.\" It was impossible that Edinburgh could remain long without its castle, and in 1574 steps were taken for its restoration. Ere long the fortress was reared again, and as it then became so it remains substantially now, save for the wear of time. The excitement seems to have died down; but in 1794, while the crown-room"], [28, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 20 was being searched for another purpose, the oaken chest was, says Scott, the only object to be seen, and that \" the Commissionershad no authority to open.'' So the mystery remained ; but in 1S17, George IV., then Prince Regent, issued a warrant empowering the officers of state to open the room and make search for the royal insignia. Amongst the names of the commissioners appointed to perform this duty we find Walter Scott, General Hope, and Thomas Thomson. Scott thus describes their proceedings : \u2014 \" It was with feelings of no common anxiety that the commis sioners, having read their warrant, pro ceeded to the crown-room ; and having found all there in the state in which it had been left in 1794, commanded the King's smith, who was in attendance, to force open the great chest, the keys of which had been sought for in vain. The general persuasion that the Regalia had been secretly removed, weighed heavy on the mind of all while the labour pro ceeded. The chest seemed to return a hollow and empty sound to the strokes of the hammer ; and even those whose expectations had been most sanguine, felt at the moment the probability of dis appointment, and could not but be sensible, that should the result of the research confirm these foreboding's, it would only serve to show that a national affront and injury had been sustained, for which it might be difficult, or rather impossible, to obtain any redress. The joy was, therefore, extreme when, the ponderous lid of the chest being forced open, at the expense of some time and labour, the Regalia were discovered lying at the bottom covered with linen cloths, exactly as they had been left in the year 1707 The reliques were passed from hand to hand, and greeted with the affectionate reverence which emblems so venerable, restored to public view after the slumber of more than a hundred years, were so peculiarly calculated to excite. The discovery was instantly communicated to the public by the display of the royal standard from the Castle, and vvas greeted by the shouts of the soldiers in garrison, and of a multitude of persons assembled on the Castle-hill; indeed, the rejoicing was so general and sincere, as plainly to show that, however altered in other respects, the people of Scotland had lost nothing of that national enthusiasm which formerly had displayed itself in grief for the loss of these emblematic honours, and now was expressed in joy for their recovery.\" \u2014 Scott's Provincial Antiquities. And now it may be worth our while to look into a curious little room near to the crow'n-room, and like it close by the old palace hall, which, by an odd irony of changeful time, is now the barrack hospital. This room is little more than a closet, but it has some measure of interest to every Englishman and every Scotchman; for here, on June 19, 1566, Queen Mary gave birth to that son James, in whom, as James I. of England and VI. of Scotland, the sovereignty of the two countries was to unite. Very quaint are the words which are inscribed upon the wall of this chamber \u2014 \"Lord Jesu Chryst, That crounit was with Thornse, Preserve the Birth, quhais Eadgie heir is borne, And send Hir Sonne successioune, to Reigne still, Lang in this Realme, if that it be Thy will Als grant, O Lord, quhat ever of Hir proseed Be to Thy Honer and Prais, sobied. 19th Junii, 1566.\" Had we time to tarry there were much more to see about this grand fortress : we should stand awhile in awe before old \" Mons Meg,\" the battered looking cannon whose history, though definitely given, really goes back into indefinite history ; we should go through the place and say, ' Here walked James IV. before the battle of Flodden ; here Queen Jane found her son, James II. , and had him conveyed away to safer quarters,' and so on, until the whole place would seem to be"], [29, "THE CASTLE OF EDINBURGH. 21 crowded with men and women who had indeed their share in life's conflict, but have long had done with this mortal strife. voice of life and industry : while beyond a gorgeous landscape is spread out, reaching almost to the ancient land marks of the kingdom, guarded on the far east by the old keep of Craigmillar Castle, and on the west by Merchiston Tower.

Here we shall see much to remind us and he had referred to the nickname which wicked neighbours were giving it. \" Well, Mr. Ramsay,\" said the lively judge, \" now that I see you in it, I think they are not very far wrong ! \" Here Ramsay died in 1757, just a little while before Burns was born. Near at hand was another house, said to have been once the city residence of the \"Laird o' Cockpen,\" who is cele brated in Scottish song. And now we reach the point where stand on either side the way, like rival claimants for ecclesiastical regard, the Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland, and the \" New Assembly Hall,\" where year by year the two great \" ecclesiastical Parlia ments\" meet. For three hundred years and more the old Assembly has held its gatherings, oftentimes in old days amid strife and clamour, not seldom in the face of tyranny and priestcraft. Its first meeting in 1560 was attended by John Knox, and marked the establishment of Protestantism in Scotland ; in later days it caused its voice to be heard for national honour and Presbyterian sim plicity when Charles the First reigned, and Laud caused the beautiful Liturgy ofthe Church of England to be brought into contempt by his untimely pressing of it upon the people. In still more re cent times it has lived in calmer weather, save when, in 1733, and again in 1843, bands of its members went forth to vin dicate what they regarded as the cause of spiritual freedom and independence. The noble building in which it now meets has been mainly a witness of quiet times ; the Lord High Commissioner, represen tative of the Queen, comes to it in state year by year with no fear of more bitter dis pute to ruffle his dignity than when some venerable father rises in hot indignation to declaim against the budding heresies of bygone times ; and as we pass the now poor-looking houses and glance at the slatternly dames and ragged, dirty children who are all about, we shall gladly go back in imagination to days when these houses were homes of lords and ladies, of scholars and divines, and when the very elite of old Scotland here made promenade. Weare just leaving the wide Esplanade when, look, here on the left hand is an odd eight-sided house facing the New Tower and the sea, \u2014 the house, surely, of some eccentric man who yet loved to look out on something more than his neighbour's cabbage-yard. Here in the last century lived Allan Ramsay, of whom w7e have already spoken. He had busily devoted his earlier days to trade, and had made a small fortune which enabled him \u2014 unlike his more gifted, but less wise brother poet, Robert Burns \u2014 to spend his life's evening in cir cumstances of worldly comfort, with \"honour\" and w*ith \"troops of friends\" about him. Many a joke was made at the expense of Ramsay and his house; it was so very ugly, as much so as some of those \"Queen Anne\" residences with which modern Londoners are now so familiar. It used to be called a \"goose-pie,\" and concerning this Robert Chambers tells a good story.

The New Assembly Hall symbo lises the great Disruption of 1843, when men like Chalmers and Candlish and Thomas Guthrie went forth from the Church of their fathers and set up a Church which was to mark one of the most splendid triumphs of unendowed religion which modern times have known. Here also, year by year, a gathering \u2014 still greater than the former \u2014 is convened ; and it is no unusual thing to see the great building packed \" from floor to ceiling,\" from a May sun set till wellnigh grey morning, with eager listeners, hanging upon the lips of the leaders of debate, as they discuss, perhaps, the state of their Church, or on occasion argue pro and con the vexing question ofa \"kist of whistles.\" Strange to say, this Hall was built upon what was believed to have been a royal palace. Here dwelt Mary of Guise, mother of \"Queen Mary,\" and it is con jectured that the latter took refuge in this house after the murder of Rizzio, fearing \u2014 and not without some reason \u2014 the bloodthirstiness of her lords. At the time of its demolition it is said the mansion still bore traces of departed glories, in handsome fireplaces, in richly-dight pillars, and recesses carved in door and panel. oratory an infantine head and hand in wax, being all that remained of a bambino, or figure of the child Jesus, and now pre served by the Society of Antiquaries. The edifice had many windows on the northern side, and from these a fine view must have been commanded of the gardens in the immediate foreground, sloping downward to the loch, the opposite bank, with its farm-houses, the Firth of Forth, and Fifeshire. ' It was interest ing,' says the author of ' Traditions of Edinburgh,' ' to wander through the dusky mazes of this ancient building, and reflect that they had been occupied three centuries ago by a sovereign princess, and of the most illustrious lineage. Here was a substantial monument of the con nection between Scotland and France. She, whose ancestors owned Lorraine as a sovereignty, who had spent her youth in the proud halls of the Guises in Picardy, and had been the spouse of a Longueville, was here content to live \u2014 in a close in Edinburgh! In these ob scurities, too, was a government con ducted, which had to struggle with Knox, Glencairn. James Stewart, Morton, and many other powerful men, backed by a popular sentiment which never fails to triumph. It was the misfortune of Mary j(of Guise) to be placed in a position to. resist the Reformation. Pier own cha racter deserved that she should have stood in a more agreeable relation to what Scotland now venerates, for she was mild and just, and sincerely anxious for the welfare of her adopted country. It is also proper to remember, on the present occasion, that in her Court she maintained a decent gravity, nor would she tolerate any licentious practices therein. Her maids of honour were always busied in commendable exercises, she herself being an example to them in virtue, piety, and modesty. \" A portion of this building,\" says a recent writer, \" accessible by a stair near the head of the close, contained a hall, with other apartments, all remarkable for the great height and beauty of their ceilings, on all of which were coats armorial in fine stucco. In the decorated chimney ofthe former were the remains of one of those chains to which, in Scot- land, the poker and tongs were usually attached, to prevent their being used as weapons in case of any sudden quarrel. One chamber was long known as the queen's Dcid-room, where the individuals of the royal establishment were kept between their death and burial.

Now at length we are in the part of the High-street known as the \"Lawnmar ket.\" They tell how once upon a time \u2014 it was in the year 1640 \u2014 this place was the scene of one of the silliest inci dents in the silly annals of duelling.

Session in the latter half of last century, who, on his return from London after the decision in favour of the defendant in the romantic Douglas case, received an almost royal reception. The horses were taken out of his carriage, and he was drawn to his home by exultant crowds. The mention of Boswell's. name recalls the fact that in 1773 might have often been seen in this court a face and figure which seem as familiar to us to-day as the name and fame of the man who owned them \u2014 Samuel Johnson. And it may be as well to say something here about the visit of the great lexico grapher to the city in the company of his \" man Friday,\" Boswell, whom we have just named. Our talks about Edinburgh would not be complete without some reference to this visit, although it may appear to us to have been less an honour to Edinburgh and more a privilege to Johnson to have seen its beauties and! mingled in its society than it appeared, to Boswell. It is indeed amusing to find the latter writing to Robertson the historian in this strain: \u2014 \" Our friend, Mr. Samuel Johnson, is in great health, and spirits, and, I do think, has a serious. resolution to visit Scotland this year. The more attraction, however, the better;\" and to the poet Beattie in these terms: \u2014 \"I wash that every power of attraction. may be employed to secure our having so valuable an acquisition, and therefore I hope you will without delay write to me what I know you think, that I may read it to the mighty sage with proper emphasis.\" Boswell then tells how a certain Mr. Justice Chambers gave him a convoy to Newcastle, and how a Mr. Scott, an Oxford man, acted as. minister in attendance thence to Edin burgh; and so says Boswell proudly, \" with such propitious convoy did he proceed to my native city.\" One reads with tongue in cheek, and asks, How more exultingly could this clever showman have written of the advent of Socrates or Plato ? whereupon he exclaimed in wrath that the Major was neither soldier nor gentle man, and challenged him to meet him \"without this gate and at a distance from his guards.\" < Having delivered himself of this brave speech he turned away, and went down the castle-hill; but he was not to escape so easily. Major Somerville followed him, armed with a rapier, and upon reaching him told him that he must accompany him a little way : so the two went to the Greyfriars' churchyard as the quietest spot in the neighbourhood. But Crawford's bravery ran more to words than deeds, and he had no sooner bid him draw than he doffed his hat and begged pardon. The Major was astonished and disgusted, and call ing Crawford a \"coward and a fool,\" left the ground. Crawford was cha grined athis own poltroonery, and finding his courage blown upon, he determined in his own style to vindicate it. Meeting Somerville one day afterwards in the Lawnmarket, he went up to him, bared his sword and dagger, and said, \" If you be a pretty man, Draw !\" Somerville, nothing frightened, first warded his attack with a cane which he carried, and then, taking his sword, he thrust at his opponent. Crawford was driven back, and Somer ville drove him gradually but surely down the Lawnmarket, and after a long struggle with no doubtful advantage, he took the heavy end of his sword, and knocked him down. Meantime some of Somerville's soldiers appeared on the scene, and would have made short work of his foe; but Somerville saved his life. The man, however, was imprisoned for an attack upon an officer, and, as he well deserved, was sent to prison. On the north side of the Lawnmarket is a court called James' s-court, which claims special remark as having been the locality in which both David Hume the historian, and Boswell the biographer of Johnson, had for a time their dwell ing. Here, too; dwelt Sir Hay Camp bell, Lord President of the Court of"], [35, "FROM CASTLE TO PALACE. 27 No matter: Johnson came to Edin burgh, came to Scotland which he had so much maligned. Boswell had preceded him, and was overjoyed to receive a note from him on the 14th of August, 1773, dated from \" Boyd's Inn,\" at the head of Canongate, saying that he had arrived. \"I went to him directly. He embraced me cordially ; and I exulted in the thought that I now had him actually in Caledonia.\" Boswell carried him off at of the Edinburgh of that time, when foul water was thrown out upon the street, and growling to his companion, not without an almost Scotch grimness of humour, \"I smell you in the dark!\" At length they arrive at Boswell's home and Mrs. Boswell regales Johnson w7ith tea, and so wins his heart.

While in Edinburgh, Johnson met with most of its most notable men, with Ro bertson, Sir William Forbes the famous banker, Adam Ferguson, Dalrymple of Hailes, Dr. Gregory, Murray of Hender land, Dr. Webster, and other worthies; but here at least we cannot dwell upon his interviews with these. Let us cull, however, from Boswell's Journals the story of Johnson's walk through the Edinburgh streets. As we are making this walk ourselves, it may do us good to tarry awhile in James' s-court, and learn what Johnson saw, and how he saw it. Worthy Mr. James Kerr, Keeper of the Records : ' Half our nation was bribed by English money.' Johnson: 'Sir, that is no defence; that makes you worse.' Good Mr. Brown, Keeper of the Advocates' Library: 'WTe had better say nothing about it.' \"We walked out that Dr. Johnson might see some of the things which we have to show at Edinburgh.

We went to the Advocates' Library, of which Dr. Johnson took a cursory view, and then to what is called the Laigh, or Under Parliament House, where the records of Scotland, which have a universal security by register, are deposited till the great Register Office be finished. I was pleased to behold Dr. Samuel Johnson rolling about in this old magazine of antiquities. There was by this time a pretty numerous circle of us attending upon him. Somebody talked of happy moments for composition, and how a man can write at one time and not at another. ' Nay,' said Dr. Johnson, ' a man may write at any time if he will set himself doggedly to it.'

We pro ceeded to the College, with the Principal at our head. Dr. Adam Ferguson, whose Essay on the History of Civil Society gives him a respectable place in the ranks of literature, was with us. As the college buildings are indeed very mean, the Pjincipal said to Dr. Johnson that he njust give them the same epithet that a Jesuit did when showing a poor college abroad: ' Hae miser iae nostrac.' Dr. Johnson was, however, much pleased with the library, and with the conversa tion of Dr. James Robertson, professor of oriental languages, the librarian. We talked of Kennicott's edition of the Hebrew Bible, and hoped it would be quite faithful. \u2014Johnson : ' Sir, I know not any crime so great that a man could contrive to commit, as poisoning the sources of eternal truth.' convenient w7all built.

We surveyed that part of the palace appropriated to the Duke of Hamilton, as keeper, in which our beautiful Queen Mary lived, and in which David Rizaio was murdered, and also the state rooms. Dr. Johnson was a great reciter of all sorts of things, serious and comical. I overheard him repeating here, in a kind of muttering tone, a line of the old ballad, 'Johnny Armstrong's Last Good Night' : \u2014 I pointed out to him where there formerly stood an old wall inclosing part of the college, which I remember bulged out in a threatening manner, and of which there was a common tradition \u25a0rimilar to that concerning Bacon's study at Oxford, that it would fall upon some very learned man.

The kirk was dedicated to St. Giles, an abbot and confessor, who is supposed to have lived about the seventh century, and to have been born at Athens. In early life he left his native country, and settled in the solitude of a forest in the diocese of Nismes; but how the people of Edin burgh came to select him as their patron saint no one knows. There is no trace, at least, of his ever being on English or Scottish soil, though his name is perpet uated both in London and in Edinburg-h; and the only thing that was ever seen of him in the latter w7as his \"arm,\" w7hich was brought to the city by Preston of Gorton, in the time of James II. , \" thank fully received,\" we are told, \" and honourably requited.\" Preston was privileged thenceforward to carry the relic in all coming processions; and, after his death, a chapel was founded to his memory, and a priest appointed to say mass yearly for his soul. The \"arm,\" however, we may say in passing, did not survive the Reformation \u2014 at least as a church property. Edinburgh,\" says Chalmers in his Caledonia, \"St. Giles's church is often mentioned, from the 12th to the 16th century. In 13S4, the Scottish barons met in St. Giles's Church and resolved on war with England. In 1385, St. Giles's Church and the town were burnt by Richard II. It was probably damaged rather than destroyed, and it was soon repaired. Before the reign of James III. many altars and chaplainries were founded by persons and corporations, and were con secrated to their favourite saints. Besides the endowments of the founders, for those altars and chaplains many persons gave private donations, which were occasion ally granted by well-meaning indivi duals. When St. Giles's Church was made collegiate in 1466, the revenues of those altars and chaplainries were allotted for the new establishment. Be side all those chaplainries there were in Edinburgh various other chapels and oratories. In 1559 all those altars were demolished, and the chaplainries were disused. After this ancient church had been despoiled [so Chalmers phrases it], it was mechanically divided into various apartments, which were set aside for different purposes; either for preaching, forthe administration of justice, for teach ing, for a prison, for a workhouse, for the town-clerk's office, and for other pur poses of less importance and dignity. The principal division which had been formed out of the choir, was fitted up in 1663, and called the New Church; in it were erected the seats for the king, for the magistrates, for the judges, and from such appropriations, it was denominated afterward the High Church!' In 1553, Sir David Lindesay of the Mount, wrote these lines against it, and against the pomps of the procession in which it was carried : \u2014 Fy on you fostereris of idolatrie ! That till ane deid stok does sik reverence In presens of the pepill publicklie : Feir ye nocht God, to commit sik offence, I counsall you do yit your diligence, To gar suppresse sik greit abusion ; Do ye nocht sa, I dreid your recompense, -Sail be nocht else, but elene confusion. In 1558, a \"protestant mob,\" says Chalmers, \" raised a tumult, in the midst of which the sanctity of St. Giles was violated, and his images broken, and his arm derided.\" So ended the honour of St. Giles's arm, and in 1562 the practical citizens of Edinburgh sold its ornaments to provide a fund for repairing the church. Four churches, in all, were made out of the edifice after the Reformation, and John Knox, as parish minister of Edin burgh, used often to be heard in the High Church in those stirring times. The grave of the great reformer, we may mention, is in Parliament-square, once the churchyard, where a stone has been \"As the parish church of the town of"], [45, "FROM CASTLE TO PALACE. 33 placed, with the legend \"I.

In 1633, Charles I. and Laud, \" The rash and fatal experiment was made, 23rd July, 1637, in the High Church of St. Giles, Edinburgh, where the dean of the city prepared to read the ST.

The time for such changes was ill-chosen, and the indignation of the citizens only waited for some fit occasion to express itself. This occasion was found in the attempt made to introduce Laud'sLiturgy (which, new service before a numerous concourse of persons, none of whom seem to have been favourably disposed to its recep tion. As the reader of the prayers an nounced the Collect for the day, an old woman, named Jenny Geddes, who kept a green-stall in the High-street, bawled out \u2014 ' The deil colick in the warne of thee, thou false thief! dost thou say the"], [46, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 34 Of the Parliament House we shall not stay to say much. It was built in the first half of the seventeenth century, but has been greatly altered since those days. To a visitor now the portion which is probably of most interest is the great hall, which measures 122 feet by 49, and the roof of which is a specimen of beautifully carved oak. Upon the walls hang many portraits of distin guished Scotch legal luminaries, and around the room are also many statues of departed judges and advocates, \u2014 Forbes of Culloden, Dundas, Jeffrey, Cockburn, and others. Here, from day to day, and \" from morn till noon, from noon till dewy eve,\" well, till late after noon at least, the lawyers make their promenade in gown and full-bottomed wig.

Old stagers, too, are here, who began with like hopes, and for whom all such things are past; briefless and fortuneless, they cannot leave the old haunt, which has for them a strange fascination. And here, too, in intervals of labour, you may see the men upon whom fortune has smiled : men who have come from a \" case,\" and who have a brief space for a walk and talk until the next comes on.

With that she flung at the dean's head the stool upon which she had been sitting, and a wild tumult instantly commenced. The women of lower condition [instigated, it is said, by their superiors] flew at the dean, tore the surplice from his shoulders, and drove him out of the church. The Bishop of Edinburgh mounted the pulpit, but he was also assailed with missiles, and with vehement exclamations of 'A Pope! a Pope! Antichrist! pull him down, stone him ! ' while the windows were broken with stones flung by a disorderly multi tude from without. This was not all : the prelates were assaulted in the street, and misused by the mob. The life ofthe bishop was with difficulty saved by Lord Roxburghe, who carried him home in his carriage, surrounded by his retinue with drawn swords.\" We live to-day in \"sleeker times with smoother men.\" Even to many Scotch men a Liturgy, separated from the as sociations which made it an object of de testation in the days of the Covenanters, is an acceptable form of worship ; but we cannot help for all that sympathising with those stern folk of other times, who, in fighting against Charles's policy, felt that they were vindicating their own re ligious freedom. To-day the Scottish people are turn ing towards St. Giles's with longings to see it restored to something of the beauty alike in architecture and in ser vice which one associates w7ith the name of a cathedral. There is an organ now in St. Giles's; the service altogether has grown more ornate; the miserable re storers of 1829, whose prosaic patchwork left little more than the grand old crown shaped campanile to tell the tale of what the place had been, have been superseded. And now, chiefiy at the instance and through the generosity of Dr. William Chambers, the building is being con verted once more into one undivided and beautiful church as it was in the days o' auld langsyne. Striking off from this hall are the vari ous courts, those of the \"ordinaries,\" or judges of first instance, which combine to form what is called the \" Outer House,\" while the \"Inner House,\" in which sit the Lord President, the Lord Justice-Clerk, and the senior judges, is in the same part of the building, and the"], [47, "FROM CASTLE TO PALACE. 35 High Court of Justiciary, the chief Assize Court of Scotland, is also held in the Parliament House.

Was it not James's place of refuge when the mob, inflamed by a seditious preacher, broke forth on him with cries of 'The sword of the Lord and of Gideon \u2014 bring forth the wicked Haman ? ' Since that time how many hearts have throbbed within these w7alls, as the tolling of the neigh bouring bell announced to them how fast the sands of their life were ebbing : how many have sunk at the sound \u2014 how many were supported by stubborn pride and dogged resolution \u2014 how many by the consolation of religion ? \" This Parliament House, especially the hall in which the National Assembly was held, has many historical associa tions connected with it, between the years of 1639 and 1707. The first meet ing of the Legislature which was held in it was in the former year, when King Charles and his Scottish subjects were at variance, and it was characterised by bitter wrangling and disputes. The heart of Scotland was sore ; the people were indignant at the attempts made to tyrannise over them in matters of re ligion : and, in short, a habitually loyal people had become estranged. Writing of this time, a curious author says : \u2014 \" I am come hither on a very convenient time; for here's a National Assembly and a Parliament, my lord Traquair being his majesty's commissioner. The bishops are all gone to rack, [ruin,] and they have had but a sorry funeral. The very name is grown so contemptible, that a black dog, if he hath any white marks about him, is called Bishop. Our Lord of Canterbury is grown here so odious that they call him commonly in the pul pit the priest of Baal and the son of Belial.\" And as we read the Scottish history onward, and follow the meetings of the \" Estates,\" we seem to see this hall and its corridors all astir, animated debate going on within, while much tortuous scheming and machination are done without. We fear that the cause of \"Home Rule\" in its broadest sense would scarcely be furthered were the inner history of Scottish parliaments between 1639 and 1707 to be written in full. To us the Tolbooth, though now passed away, is very real from its as sociation with Scott's account of the Porteous mob, and with the story of Effie Deans. We seem to see it stand ing there as of old at the northwest corner of Parliament-square, as we read the following description of it as seen by Reuben Butler on the night of the mob: \u2014 \"I stood now before the Gothic entrance ofthe ancient prison, which, as is well known to all men, rears its front in the very middle of the High-street, forming, as it were, the termination to a huge pile of buildings called the Lucken booths, which, for some inconceivable reason, our ancestors had jammed into the midst of the principal street of the town, leaving for passage a narrow street on the north and on the south, into which the prison opens, a narrow, crooked lane, winding betwixt the high and sombre walls of the Tolbooth and the adjacent houses on one side, and the buttresses and projections of the old church upon the other.

In 1582 Durie returned to the city, and he was met at the Netherbow Port by the \"haill toun\" as a token of welcome. The great multitude followed him up the High-street, with their heads uncovered, and sang the while this grand old ver sion ofthe 124th Psalm : \u2014 The cunning serpent has laboured to persuade me that I have merited heaven and eternal blessedness by the faithful discharge of my ministry.

Amongst all the scenes witnessed here, one of the most memorable and nationally characteristic is that of the grand reception accorded to one John Durie, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, in 15S2. Durie had given some offence to one of King James's favourites, and that \" most high and mighty prince\" had had him suspended by His great power did frame. It is thus that throughout \u2014 at least, ever since Reformation days \u2014 and, most of all, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the religious and the political life of Edin burgh have been closely interwoven. To this various causes have contributed : amongst others, the policy of the"], [51, "FROM CASTLE TO PALACE. 39 Stuarts, which involved questions of royal prerogative and of national honour with those of religious liberty. Presbyteri anism became bound up with the nation's liberty, and many a man who otherwise might have been a mere politician, was made to think about religion. And now we have come to Holy rood. Round us, as we pass into the open space, are the poor houses in which debtors have often been fain to take refuge, the precincts of the Abbey being a sanctuary in which the man who owes is safe from his creditor. No doubt many of these men could have told a curious tale, could w7e but hear it. We pass now to speak of the Canon \u2022gate, which gained its name from being the gate or road by which the canons of rthe Abbey of Holyrood passed into the \u2022city. The abbey and abbey lands hav ang- many privileges attached to them, \u2022many people began to settle in the neighbourhood, and thus the Canongate rose to the dignity of a parish and a burgh. It became the home of many of the nobility and gentry, and some few traces remain upon the old houses of the grandeur of earlier days. It seems like a link to the past that until very recently a baronet of venerable stockhadhis resi dence in \"Chessel's-court, Canongate.\" Amongst the most notable buildings is the Canongate Tolbooth, a curious French-looking building, disfigured by a singularly ugly clock, and bearing the rather incongruous motto \u2014 \" Sic itur ad astra,\" \" such is the way to heaven.\" It is the Holyrood motto, but stuck upon a court-house it suggests rather what \u25a0the aim of justice should be than what dt is. Glad are we to stand once more in the open space ; for the Canongate is dingy and dirty, and for all our memories of departed greatness and their fragrance, the odour of the place is not fragrant : indeed, truth to tell, the very scum of Edinburgh, in more senses than one, seems to find its level amongst the remains of Scottish nobility. And thus it is refreshing to breathe the pure air, and even to be looking at the pure water as it pours from the fountain which stands in front of Holyrood. Our next business will be to enter the palace itself, and dream of some of its ancient glories : of days when kings and queens held court in it, and when its halls rang with music and merriment. Changed days these, when the only semblance of royalty which is seen here is when the Lord High Commissioner proceeds in his state-carriage, attended by his officers and his lackeys, from the old palace, by the way which we have traversed, up the Canongate, through the Netherbow, first to St. Giles's to hear the opening sermon of the General Assem bly, and then to proceed to the Assembly Hall, and give a royal sanction to its proceedings.

Who that has ever looked upon it, as it stands there, at the foot of the grimy Canon- gate, as it w7ere aside from courts. The westmost, which was the outermost court, was larger than all the rest. It was bounded on the east by the front of the palace, which occupied the same space with its present front, and also extended further south. The three remaining sides of the outer court were bounded by walls, and at the north-west corner there was a strong gate, w7ith Gothic pillars, arches, and towers, part of which has been pulled down within these last thirty years. The next court occupied the same as the present cen tral court of the royal palace, and was surrounded with buildings. On the south there were two smaller courts, also surrounded with buildings; and there was another court on the east, which was bounded on the north by the Chapel Royal, on the west by a line of buildings covering the same space as the pre sent east front of the palace, on the south, by a row of buildings w7hich are now demolished, and on the north by a wall which divided it from St. Ann's yards. Great part of this palace was burned by Cromwell's soldiers. It was ordered to be repaired at the Restoration. Accordingly, the present magnificent fabric was designed by Sir William Bruce, a celebrated architect in the reign of Charles II. , and executed by Robert Mylne, mason. all other buildings, and clad in an ancient glory which time has only enhanced, can ever forget it ? Even the castle itself wakes up fewer memories far than this. As we look upon it, we hear once more the sounds of merry men and women as they come and go ; we think of banquets and of feasts ; we hear, perhaps, now and then, by way of deadly contrast, the serpentine whisper of conspirators, and the murmur of in trigue; but, most of all, it speaks of Scottish life in its gayest form, when kings and queens held court in Edin burgh, and when lords and ladies came from Highland and from Lowland to sun themselves in royal favour. \" The tender grace of a day that is dead\" is that which seems, most of all, to encircle it. The following interesting description of Holyrood, as it stood in the last cen tury, as compared with the Holyrood of early times, is given by Arnot : \u2014 The Palace of Holyrood bears a re semblance to that of Hampton Court It is of a quadrangular form, with a court in the centre, surrounded with piazzas.

None of what now7 remains can lay claim to antiquity, the ruins of the chapel excepted. The north-west towers were built for a royal residence, by James V., whose name is to be seen at the bottom of a niche, in the north west tower of the palace.

This having put an end to the chase, the monarch repaired to the Castle of Edinburgh; where, during the night, in a dream, he was advised, as an act of gratitude for his deliverance, to erect an abbey or house"], [55, "HOLYROOD. 43 for Canons regular, upon the spot where this miraculous interposition had taken place.\" of a beauty and grace which contem porary art cannot restore, and, let us hope, will not try. The tombs call back the memory of some illustrious dead, and, as we dream amongst them, wre think of the varying services held within these walls \u2014 Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic again; we hear now the simple melody of Scottish psalms, now the fascinating music of the mass; we recall the sadly alternating scenes of mirth and tumult in the adjoin ing palace. The while we look up into the blue sky which there is no roof to hide, and glad our hearts with thoughts of that Land into which tumult never enters, where joy is unmingled, where malice and envy cannot come, where the very name of conspiracy is unknown, \u2014 the \"Land o' the Leal.\" Thus the abbey was founded, and dedicated to the Holy Rood, or Cross, which, though he had made so light of it, had rescued him in his hour of dan ger. Its history, like that of the castle, has been a chequered one; it was de spoiled by the soldiers of Edward III. in 1332; it was burnt by Richard II. in 13S5, and again in 1544, under the attack ofthe Earl of Hertford. In 1547, after the battle of Pinkie, English soldiers stripped off its roof and carried off the bells; in 1567 it was desecrated by the Earl of Glencairn. Here Charles I. was crowned in 1633; and here that pious son of Mother-Church, James II. of Eng land, caused mass to be celebrated. The city which could not tolerate Liturgy reading in St. Giles's half a century before, was little likely to bear patiently with the Roman service in Holyrood ; and the mob, which does not measure its anger, or pay due heed to fretted roof and chiselled pillar when its blood is up, laid the \"holy and beautiful house\" once more almost in ruins. It probably remained in a dilapidated state onwards until the latter half ofthe next century, when it seems finally to have suffered at the hands of its friends, for, in order to prevent it from going to ruin, the Barons of the Exchequer ordered a new roof to be put on the building. The mason was unwise enough, however, to put on a heavy roof of stone, forgetting the shaky condition of the walls ; and, as a natural consequence, roof, walls, and gallery fell in, leaving but, as it were, a shadow of the old abbey to tell its tale. \" Thus fell,\" says an old-fashioned writer, \" thus fell the beautiful monastery of Sandae Crucis or Holyrood, after braving the fury of its enemie*= for nearly seven cen turies.\" As to the palace, it seems somewhat uncertain when it was begun. From very early times indeed, kings found an asylum within the walls of Holyrood, but probably at the first they were only accommodated as guests ofthe monastic body; gradually the necessity would be felt for something like a royal dwelling; and it may be that in this way first a little addition was made to the abbey, then a larger, and so on. But it is enough that by the time when Queen Mary began to reign, there was a palace of Holyrood, and \u2014 as everybody feels \u2014 it is Holyrood as the home of Queen Mary which keeps its memory green. It was here that she came to reside upon the 19th of April, 1561, immediately after her return to Scotland ; and here that, on July 29, 1565, she was married to Lord Darnley in the church of the abbey. It was here that David Rizzio was murdered in March, 1566; and here that Mary was married to the Earl of Bothwell on the 15th of May, 1567, \u2014 but three months after the murder of Darn ley, whom she had professed to love, and whose son was still but a baby in arms. The small portion now standing has mainly a monumental interest.

It is gene rally thought to be the right thing to spend a large amount of time in the great room called the \" Picture Gallery,\" and we think we have seen many people there with anxious visages trying to admire the hundred and eleven portraits of the Scottish kings w7hich hang around the walls. Where the portraits of the earliest of these kings \u2014 rather mythical personages they are \u2014 were got, we have no means of knowing, unless we say that, like the famous German with his system, the artist evolved these portraits from his own inner consciousness. In any case, it can scarcely be said that either history or art, kinghood or loyalty, are here greatly ennobled. One is but forced to recall the rich collection at Hampton Court to be impressed by com parison with the poverty of this quasi historic lot of pictures. we should be glad to think that those who made the walls ring with merriment had been more worthy of Mary's regard. Passing now through the Queen's bed- chamber, we come to a little closet, a sort of \" snuggery,\" which has come to be memorable in history. It was the 9th of March, 1566, and Queen Mary was sitting at supper in this little room, attended by the Countess of Argyle, David Rizzio, and a few other of those whom she recognised as private friends. The night, no doubt, went merrily on, for Mary was gay, and mirth was her native element; while the strains of Rizzio's music fascinated all. This man had come, it is supposed, with the Pied- montese ambassador in 1561, and he seems, almost from the very first, to have attracted the favour of the Queen. Coming from the valleys of Northern Italy, he carried with him that gift of music which we recognise as part of the very nature of his race ; and Mary called him into service as her minstrel, and as the musician of her private chapel. By- and-by, he filled other offices for her, and at last he appears to have been a kind of confidential secretary. In short, Queen Mary had that weakness for a \" favourite \" which was the bane of several of her descendants ; and the recipient of this unlucky \"favour\" was Rizzio. The nation had viewed his pro- motion with aversion, and even disgust ; and the chief nobles especially could not brook the sight of this man, without personal attractions, of no family, a foreigner \u2014 and an Italian foreigner, who enjoyed a confidence in which they did not share. Knox and the reforming party must have had the additional ob jection to him that he was ofthe Roman faith, and, as an Italian, a very Roman of the Romans. At last things came to a crisis; and upon this 9th of March. Rizzio's hour had come. Just when the merriment was at its height, a trap-dot r opened, and Lord Darnley, Mary's hus band, first of the conspirators, entered A little way from the room in which these are contained, are the apartments of Queen Mary. The chief of these is that called the presence-chamber, where the Queen used to give audiences. It was here that she most likely sat when she held her famous conference with John Knox about a week after his arrival in Edinburgh. The interview was not a pleasant one, and was not even a profit able one; it only showed the impossi bility of the maintenance of friendly feeling between the good-hearted, yet rather fickle and light-hearted Queen, and the stern, Elijah-like, dogmatic, and not very patient preacher of the Scottish Reformation. Says an English man, writing from Edinburgh in those days : \u2014 \" Mr. Knox spoke upon Tuesday to the Queen. He knocked so hastily upon her heart that he made her to weep, as well you know that some of that sex will do for anger as well as grief, though i;i that the Lord James will disagree with me.\" But let us believe that many another interview of a more pleasing kind took place in this presence-chamber; although"], [57, "TIIE MEN OF EDINBURGH. 45 the little room. Lord Ruthven came next, \" in complete armour,\" says Scott, \" looking pale and ghastly, as one scarcely recovered from long sickness,\" with one foot in the grave, indeed, yet thirsting for blood; others followed. Their threatening looks soon indicated their mission, and Rizzio, who was not much of a man, crept behind the Queen. He was soon seized, how'ever, and his craven murderers hurried him to the principal staircase, where they completed their deed with brutal ferocity, tradition recording that his body was covered with fifty-six wounds. The \"noble\" Ruthven tarried behind with the Queen, and bravely helped himself to a cup of wine to refresh him after his heroic work ! They point you still to some marks upon the floor at the head of the stair case, which they say are the marks of Rizzio's blood, and they tell you that no washing will wash it out. From the tablets of history, at least, it is inefface able, and there are no annals of Scot land which do not record with shame the murder of David Rizzio. The Men of Edinburgh. T would be easy to oc- cupy pages upon pages 1 with reminiscences ofthe \" men of Edinburgh,\" but our space for talking of this interesting theme is somewhat limited. Our book, however, would be incomplete with- in height, is altogether a mistake. One writer says of him : \u2014 \" I know not whether there ever was a greater mind enclosed in so frail and weak a body.\" Let us give M'Crie's description of his appearance : \u2014 \" He was of small stature and a weakly habit of body ; a circum- stance which seems to give us a higher idea of the vigour of his mind. His por- trait seems to have been taken more than once during his life, and frequently engraved. It continues still to frown in the antechamber of Queen Mary, to whom he was often an ungracious visitor. Wre discern in it the traits of his characteristic intrepidity, austerity, and keen penetration. Nor can we overlook his beard, w'hich, according to the custom of the times, he wore long, and reach- ing to his middle; a circumstance which I mention the rather because some writers have gravely assured us that it was the chief thing which procured him reverence among his countrymen.\" You must picture to yourself, then, this man of might as a man whose bodily presence was weak: and as we recall his name we come thus to wonder again out some mention of them, and some little sketch of their doings and their ways. The old streets have been trodden by many whose names will never be for gotten ; and, as we have already seen, there are houses still standing, some of them inhabited by busy humble folk to day, whose walls enclosed some of the greatest souls whose influence has been lelt in the social and political and re ligious history of Great Britain. With whom can we begin more fitly than with John Knox, than whom there was three hundred years ago no more prominent figure in Edinburgh ? Pro minent, yes, and yet in one sense not so; for the imaginary portrait of him which we call up as a great brawny man, strong of muscle and commanding"], [58, "46 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. and fear, with a furring of marticks about his neck, a staffe in theane hand, and gude, godlie Richart Ballenden, his servand, halden up the uther oxter [arm-pit], from the abbey to the parish-kirk, and by the at the staying power which lies in great souls, and almost seems to defy the dying bodies which hold them confined.

Nor did his in fluence end here; for to him also Scot land owes her high position in matters of education ; her parochial schools, which have been a tower of strength to her, were instituted at his suggestion ; and thus it has come about, through his instrumentality, that for Edinburgh and for Scotland that scandal is meaningless which declares that the Church is the enemy of all liberal education. be said to be first the training-school, then the scene of professional labour, of all Scottish \"advocates.\" And thus as we turn to such books as Dean Ram say's \"Reminiscences,\" Dr. Rogers's \"Traits of Scottish Character,\" . Cock burn's \"Memorials,\" and the like, the pag-es seem to bristle with ana of law yers and divines.. Amongst the latter one of the most notable in his day was Dr. Webster, one of the \" ministers of Edinburgh.\" He belonged to the more evangelical section in his church, ard was in high repute for piety; moreover, the great exertions which he made to institute a Widows' Fund made him a lasting- name. But Dr. Webster, like most of his neighbours in those days, was a man fond of society and of convivial life, a deep drinker of claret, the fashionable beverag-e of the time in Scotland ; and though by no means a drunkard, he was a notorious tippler. Yet, so far as appears, his repute as a bon vivant did not reach his congregation, and hence an amusing story about him. He v a ; winding his way home one Saturday night from some lively gathering, and was finding the street rather broad for him. To use a Scotch distinction, \"he was na sou', but he had a drappie in his ee.\" Just as he was making the best of his way homewards, his beadle met him, and accosted him. \"Eh, Dr. Wabster, what wad yer Session think gin they saw ye the noo?\" \"Nae thing, Jeems,\" answered the Doctor; \" they would na believe their ain een, man.\" Naturally a great many of the asso ciations which gather around the name of Edinburgh are connected with clergy men and lawyers, for the two centres of Edinburgh life may be said to be the ecclesiastical and the legal. As to the former, it is not only that Edinburgh is pretty full of churches, and therefore of ministers, but that year by year in the month of May the three chief Presbyterian churches hold their annual gatherings, \u2014 theEstablished Church meetingin itsHall in the High-street, the Free in the new Assembly Hall on the Mound, and the United Presbyterians in the Synod Hall, just below the Castle Rock. During the month probably a thousand clergymen visit the Scottish capital ; and the som bre aspect of Princes-street during the hours of promenade in May has become proverbial That the legal profession should be so identified with Edinburgh is a matter of course. The great Scot tish tribunal, the Court of Session, sits in the Parliament House ; and this may Another good story is told regarding two other notable Edinburgh ministers, the one Dr. Henry, author of '\u25a0' Henry's History of England,\" the other Dr. Macknight, whose name lives even yet amongst well-read theologians as the author of a \"Harmony ofthe Gospels.\" Henry was a great wag, if not a great preacher; Macknight was neither.

Gillespie was one of the greatest ornaments of the Scottish Church ; and even those who by no means sympathise throughout with his views are constrained to honour and love his memory. He w7as born in 1613, and became a Bachelor of Arts in his seventeenth year. Scarce had he attained his majority when he became chaplain to Lord Kenmure, and he was but twenty-nine when he was called to be one of the clergy of Edinburgh. He ap pears to have been a man of mark from his earliest time; his scholarship, his zeal, and his wisdom, seem alike to have accorded to him a place w'hich was given but to few of his years ; and thus it was that he was sent as commissioner to the Westminster Assembly in 1643. The quaint old letter-writer, Robert Baillie, whose account of that assembly and the men who took part in it gives us the best picture which we have of it, says of him: \u2014 \"We got good help in our assembly debates of Lord Warris ton, . . but of none more than the noble youth, Mr. Gillespie. I admire his gifts, and bless God, as for all my colleagues, so for him in particular, as equal in these to the first in the assembly.\" There can be little doubt that his single mind contributed largely to the formation of the doctrinal standards of the Presby terian Church. Robertson still lives among us in his History of Scotland, his Life of Charles V, and his History of America; and whilst these remain as monuments of long and careful labour and of refined style, we must re- In the General Assembly of the Church he took a prominent place, as the leader of the \" Moderate,\" or, as we should say, \"Broad\" party in his time. And it is remarked that he made one of his earliest appearances as a leader of debate in defending the cause of Home, the author of the Tragedy of Douglas. But even all Robertson's eloquence on Home's behalf availed only to abate somewhat the vigour of Scottish eccle' siastical wrath, for Home, although not deposed, had to retire from the ministry of the Church. It may be as well here to say a word of Home himself, for he also was a not able literary character in Edinburgh society. This man was certainly a member of the Church Militant in a peculiar sense, for in the same year in which he was licensed to preach (1745), he offered his services against Prince Charlie, and, in 1746, he was actually amongst those who were taken prisoners at Falkirk. In this same year he was presented to theparish of Athelstaneford, in East Lothian, the parish in which Robert Blair had ministered. But it cannot be said that his enthusiasm lay toward his sacred calling ; and the quiet of a country manse seems to have been hailed by him mainly as a means for indulging that dramatic gift which lay so close to his heart. His first tragedy was completed in 1749, and, fairly en dowed with ambition as he was, he set out for London with it, \u2014 no small journey in those days; but London, in the person of Garrick, gave him a cold reception. Home could not bear this; and there are on record some fine, but self-over-"], [61, "THE MEN OF EDINBURGH. 49 rating lines which he addressed to the \" Image of Shakspeare \" upon the occa sion. first in the neighbourhood of the Scottish capital, and latterly in Edinburgh itself, and were passed in the enjoyment of \"literary leisure\" and congenial society. His house was kept full of guests, and his table was surrounded by the chief writers and wits of his time. David Hume, the historian, was one of the chief amongst his friends, and there are some playful stories told of their friendship. Upon one occasion the two were having a warm debate over their common patronymic, which the historian had changed in his case to Hume. Hume proposed that they should draw lots to decide which was the proper name. He was not, however, to be daunted by one rebuff; so back he came to Athelstaneford once more \u2014 this time to write his tragedy of Douglas. This also he took to London, but Garrick would have none of it, and declared it \"totally unfit for the stage.\". 'So he must needs have his play tried in a more circum- scribed sphere, and by kindlier critics. Arrangements were accordingly made for having it produced at Edinburgh, where it was played for the first time, 14th December, 1756. The scene of the play was of national interest, as were the characters; the talent of the dra- matist was high; his manner and tone were high and pure as compared with his contemporaries ; and the success of the Edinburgh debut was complete. Edinburg-h society rang with praises of Home; and there is a good story of one exuberant Scotchman who, with rather too hasty expression of national pride, ex- claimed, 'Whaur'syer Wull Shakspeare noo ? ' It was even whispered that in one of the careful rehearsals of the tragedy some leading divines had taken part, and that Robertson, of whose champion- ship of Home we have just spoken, w7as among them. But Home's was, as we have seen, a perilous success; and its result was his being cast upon the world in search of a new profession. The pro- verbial \" beggary,\" how7ever, to which men who are thrust out of the Church are supposed to be committed, was not his portion ; for his influence obtained him, first, a post of whose duties we con- fess utter ignorance\u2014 that of \" Conser- vator of Scots Privileges at Camprere\" \u2014 but the income of which was certainly \u00a3300 a year. To this was aftenvards added an annuity of \u00a3300 from the privy-purse \u2014 so that he was soon in what for those days was, even for a gentleman of birth and education, a position of comfort. His later years were spent, \"Nay,\" said Home, with true national persistency, \"for you gain either way; if you lose, you get what is your true name ; if I lose, you keep the name you have.\" It will not add much, perhaps, to our respect for great minds to know that another point of dispute between the historian and the dramatist was as to the comparative merits of certain W'ines, Home holding port in special abhorrence. He wrote an epigram upon the subject, which became famous: \u2014 \" Firm and erect the Caledonian stood : Old was his mutton, and his claret good ; ' Let him drink port,' an English statesman cried, \u2014 He drank the poison, and his spirit died.\" We have spoken of Hugh Blair, a man whose name is always associated with the Edinburgh of the last century, and yet of whom few people know any thing. It is no part of our purpose to sketch his life here ; and we only men tion his name to speak of him, as, per haps, the most notable preacher of his time, although probably his sermons would now be a weariness to listen to. They were characterised by great ele gance of diction and soundness of phrase; they called attention to those moral aspects of Christianity which had been too much left out of sight ; they were, indeed, after a sort, models of pulpit eloquence. But, after all, Blair,"], [62, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 50 tive ability which led him to do so much for the lower classes of society. Later years have brought to Edinburgh other men, whom we cannot tarry to cha racterise at length: in the Church of Scotland, such men as the cultured, sensitive Robert Lee; in the other churches of the city, the genial, ever fresh, ever-hearty Thomas Guthrie ; the strong, rugged, warlike Candlish ; the graceful and popular John Brown of Broughton - place ; the beloved Dean Ramsay; the tender and gifted Hanna, and shall we name, as a living repre- as a preacher, was little more than a sacred rhetorician ; and his sermons were rather blocks of marble than things of life.

It was not that other men with equally great possibilities had not been given to the Church of Scot- r <J.3 HN KM OX sentative of a band of notable men, most of whom have been taken, William Lindsay Alexander ? land : it was that the times were ripe for one great soul to move, and the soul was that of Chalmers. It was his to carry the Church of Scotland up to the crisis of 1843, and his, humanly speak ing, then to lay the foundation of a Free Church ; and he laid it so well that the building which has been reared upon it has stood unshaken the test of time.

The following is \"one of the number:\u2014\" On some occasion of their meeting, Lord Monboddo was for giving Lord Kames the precedency. Lord K. declined, and drew back, say ing, 'By no means, my lord: you must walk first, that I may see your tail.' \" Says Lord Cockburn, in his \"Memorials,\" \" Classical learning, good conversation, excellent suppers, and ingenious though unsound metaphysics, w7ere the peculiari ties of Monboddo.\" Some of the best are told regarding John Clerk, a distinguished lawyer, who afterwards became a judge under the title of Lord Eldin. He was a lawyer of great smartness and skill, and seems to have been regarded as one of the most money-making, and at the same time money-spending, men who ever practised at the Scottish bar. But it is theTnemory of Clerk as a \" good fellow,\" as a wit and humorist, which is pre served in Edinburgh. He has been described as \"the plainest, the shrewdest, and the most sarcastic of men.\" Once when pleading before the House of Lords on a case concerning the use of a mill-stream, he had occasion to use the word \"water\" very often, and he in variably pronounced it as if it were written watter. \" Mr. Clerk,\" inquired the English judge, little knowing how unsafe it was to twit him, \"do you spell 'water' in Scotland with two t's?\" \" Na, my lord,\" said Clerk, \" we dinna spell watter wi' two t's. but we spell mainners wi' twa n's.' They tell, too, how once, when apologising on behalf of a young advocate who had given mortal offence to the judges by saying that he was \" astonished \" at some de cision of theirs, he cleverly turned the apology against \"their Lordships,\" whom he was never tired of rallying. \"My Lords,\" said Clerk, \" my client has expressed his astonishment at what was done; if he had known this court as One of the most brutal judges, pro bably, who ever disgraced the Scottish bench was Lord Braxfield. He was a man apparently of great intellectual force, and to this his promotion was no doubt largely due; but he was essentially coarse \u2014 coarse in his jokes, coarse in his judgments. Can anyone con ceive of such a story as this being true of a man who claimed to sit in judgment? \u2014 When Muir, one of the political prisoners of the times of the French Revolution, was on his trial, a Mr. Horner, one ofthe jury, happened to pass Lord Braxfield' s chair. Lord Braxfield knew him, and whispered as he passed \u2014 \"Come awa', Maister Horner, come awa', and help us to hang ane o' thae scoundrels.\" Once after a poor prisoner had pleaded eloquently on his own behalf, Braxfield made this cheering speech : \" Ye're a vera clever chiel, man, but ye wad be nane the waur o' a hangin'.\""], [64, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 52 Jeffrey was a man of rare gifts, and, though now remembered largely as the man \"who did not appreciate Byron and Carlyle, he must have been one of the most cultivated Scotchmen in his time. And when we consider how abjectly the flunkeys of literature have bowed before Carlyle, copying what was weakest in him, \u2014 his peculiarities of style suited only to his own thought, deplorable when imitated; his growl at contem poraries, and often at things in general, not to speak of his ungenerous criticism of individuals, we are inclined to think a little more of Jeffrey, who clung to older and better English models. Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, and one or two others, were the originators of the Edinburgh Re view; and the days in which the former was a contributor to its pages were cer tainly its brightest. Jeffrey was also an eminent lawyer, and latterly a distin guished judge, while in society he was always a centre of attraction ; Cockburn sums up all by saying of him at the time of his death, \u2014 \" he was our sun.\" portion of the third floor in the west stair.\" \"This was such a step,\" says Chambers, \"as a man would take in those days as a consequence of improve ment in his circumstances.\" Hume him self liked this latter place well, for he writes even from brilliant Paris, whither he had gone as secretary to the Embassy, saying that he wished himself in his \" easy-chair in James's-court.\" Latterly, upon finally settling in Edinburgh, hehad a house built for him in the New Tow7n in a street called then new, which was named St. David-street. It is said that when the street was in the making, and when Hume's house had been built, some one wrote with chalk on the front of it, \"St. David-street.\" Hume's ser vant girl, indignant at the offence done \u2014 as she thought \u2014 ran in, upon discovering it, and told him how he had been mocked. \" Never mind,\" was Hume's answer, \" many a better man has been made a saint of before.\" It is rather remarkable that whilst Scotland has never been able to claim a very great historian for herself, she has given to England a Hume, a Smollett, and a Macaulay. Hume formed a promi nent figure in Edinburgh society, but this, we may safely say, was due neither to his personal graces nor to his reli gious opinions \u2014 or rather want of reli gious opinions. His infidelity, indeed, seems to have been recog-nised and borne with, and in this case toleration and acquiescence must be regarded as two very different things. But it was impossible that his great gifts, his charming manner, his unfailing geniality, should have missed the heartiest recog nition. In personal appearance he seems to have been strangely unpre possessing. One who met him in Turin has left on record a description of it. \"His face,\" says he, \"was broad and fat, his mouth wide, and without any other expression than that of imbecility; his eyes vacant and spiritless; and the corpulence of his whole person w7as far But apart from men who were divines, or who were in practice as lawyers, what striking men of Edinburgh rise before our view \u2014 David Hume, Robert Burns, Allan Ramsay, John Wilson, Walter Scott. Hume is supposed to have lived first in the Lawnmarket, and it was here, in a block of houses called Riddel ' s Land, that he began to write his History of England.

Of this strange dwelling ofa man of letters, Robert Chambers writes: \u2014 \"It is, in reality, a plain, middle-aged fabric, of no particular appearance, and without a single circumstance of a curious nature connected with it, besides the somewhat odd one, that the continu atorof the History, Smollett, lived, some time after, in his sister's house precisely opposite.\" And in 1762 he bought a house in James's-court \u2014 \" the eastern"], [65, "THE MEN OF EDINBURGH. 53 better fitted to communicate the idea of a turtle-eating alderman than of a refined philosopher.

A flattery so meaningless and so shallow could not last long, and when Burns retired to the country to marry \"Jean,\" and to settle at Ellisland, his poems were still read, but the man was shabbily neglected. There is indeed not much in the story of Burns's Edinburgh visit to ennoble him who studies it; the city showed its really worst side to the poet finally, and proved to him, what he had suspected all along, that its regard was only skin-deep.

Smith came, however, to Edinburgh after the \"Wealth of Nations\" was completed, and the \" lang toon o' Kirkcaldy\" and not Modern Athens can boast itself the birthplace of his im mortal work. He appears to have led a quiet, unpretending life in the capital. He was, strange to say, a very un practical man, correct as he was in his theories; and it was remarked that he, who could teach nations how to husband wealth, could not trust himself to pur chase even corn for his horse. He was also very absent-minded and eccentric in manner ; on the street he walked like a man not quite sound in mind ; and, upon one occasion, two fish-wives were heard discussing him. The meaning of one of the overheard remarks was unmistakable, \" Hech, sirs, an' he's well pat on tae!\" She was pitiful that one so evidently a gentleman should have so completely lost his senses. But we might go on in this garrulous fashion to talk of Edinburgh men till we had neither time nor space for aught else. Why, we must leave whole volumes un said ; and, even as we pass to other themes, great names crowd upon the mind. Would that we could talk awhile of Samuel Johnson's visit, on which we have only been able to touch; would that we could picture the nodes Ambro sianae, and talk of \" Christopher North,\" more poet than professor, more man than either; of DeQuincey; of the \"Ettrick Shepherd!\" Fain would we say some thing, too, of Alexander Smith, whose fine poetic genius as seen not only in his poems, but exquisitely in his \"Summer in Skye,\" was taken so soon from Scot land and from literature ; of the genial author of \"Rab and his Friends,\" alas! but now taken from us, whose benign countenance and genial talk no one who was happy enough to meet with him can ever forget. But this \" crack\" about Edinburgh men has lasted long enough already; w7e must be going. The name of Robert Burns has also memorable associations connected with Edinburgh, though we rather think of him in his early home in Ayr so in his later home in Dumfries, than in his Edinburgh sojourn. The mother city, however, marks a phase in his life; and the year 1786, the year in which his first volume of poems made him famous, was in some sort a red-letter year to Robert Burns. He was feted and flattered by lords and ladies, by the gentlefolk and the learned men of Edinburgh generally, who mar velled at the gifted ploughman, and pro bably took some credit to themselves by paying him attention.

An occasional snowball fight, or torch light procession, is the extent of their license. A dining club and numerous debating societies give opportunity for free intercourse.

It was founded in 1582. King James gave it a charter, but nothing else. For its permanence it has had to depend upon the benefactions of the Scottish people and the fees ofthe students. Its poverty has not prevented its success. Every year the number of students increases, and also the number of professional chairs, of which there are now forty four. Edinburgh has long been famous as a medical school, and students in medicine and surgery come from all parts of the world to attend the college and ex tra-mural lectures and demonstrations. Many of the Scotch students are poor, and if they do not literally adopt Sydney Smith's proposed motto for the Edinburgh Review, and 'cultivate literature upon a little oatmeal,' they continue, by private teaching and other means, to sustain themselves for years on what most Outside the Senatus Academicus there are the Royal College of Physicians, the"], [74, "62 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

We have said a great deal about monuments already ; but we must not omit to notice the elaborate and really fine memorial to the Prince Consort, which stands in Charlotte-square. It is the work of the veteran Sir John Steele, and is not unworthy of comparison with the more ambitious \u2014 but surely rather over-gilded \u2014 Memorial in Kensington. In addition to the churches which we have mentioned already, w7e must name St. Mary's Cathedral, in the west end, built mainly from funds left by some ardent lovers of the Scottish Episcopal Church. It was built according to the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, and is a magnificent structure of the pointed Gothic type. The Free Church has seve ral notable places of worship, amongst them, St. George's, once the scene of Dr. Candlish's labours, and now of those of his eminent successor, Dr. Whyte; Bar clay Church, near the large park named Bruntsfield Links, and others; whilst the United Presbyterians have built a hand some church in Shandwick-place, and the Congregationalists another upon George IV. Bridge, of which Dr. Lind say Alexander, the \"Bishop\" of Scottish Independency, w7as formerly minister. Behind the University is the handsome Museum of Science and Art, the \" South Kensington\" of Edinburgh; and, away behind this again, at the Lauriston end of the Meadows, is the Royal Infirmary, a noble building resembling St. Thomas's Hospital in London in its plan. It consists of eight pavilions and thirty-one large wards, and forms the largest hospital in the kingdom. It covers twelve acres Of ground, and was built at a cost of \u00a3350,000. Alongside of it are the new medical class-rooms of the University. We have already spoken of the Royal Institution buildings at the foot of the Mound. Here, every year in the spring, is held the Exhibition of the Royal Scottish Academy, and though it cannot boast equality with its sister exhibition at Burlington House, it can show every year fruits of Scottish genius, of which the country has no need to be ashamed.

Like Roslin, its castle stands upon a height commanding a view of the stream; but of this castle we care to know little save that it was the home of Drummond, the poet, and that here Ben Jonson came to visit him. We dream of the meeting of these two men, and the high thoughts which were born in them amid these lovely scenes; how proudly Drummond led his guest into his castle; how he showed him, as it were, the spring at which his poetic fancy had earliest drunk; and how the genial, laughing Ben \u2014 \" rare Ben Jonson \" \u2014 was touched and elevated, and went home to lay fairer garlands at the feet of his beloved poesy. There is nothing very much to tell of Roslin Castle. An old legend tells how one William St. Clair. ancestor to the present Earl of Rosslyn, had boasted in presence of his king, that his two hounds, \"Help\" and \"Hauld.\" could run down a stag which the king's dogs had hunted in vain, before it reached a certain point. A challenge was given, and St. Clair staked his life on the issue ; a furious run was made, and, at the risk of his neck, the ancient gentleman had the satisfaction of seeing his dogs \" do their duty.\" The king owned his defeat, and, in recognition of his liege's prowess, gave him the lands amid which the run was made. This is the chief element of romance which gathers around Roslin Castle. But far better than romance is the marvellous beauty of its position : standing there on its rugged rock over the glen ofthe Esk, it is a spot never to be forgotten. It is like a bit out of fairy land : the little stream, the thick foliage of the trees, the murmur of the deep glen, accompanied by the song of the birds and the happy voices of the many travellers who find their way to it each summer day ; and the old fortress on its crag : a picture it is for every painter \u2014 a theme for any poet.x We have been to many a fair spot in Scotland, and in England too; the glories of Glenlyon and Glenalmond we know ; the fair scenes around Ambleside and Grasmere live as dear memories with us; aye, and many a fair spot in the valleys that run among the hills of Switzerland lives in joyous recollection ; but give us this scene at Roslin Castle, with the sun to shed its light and throw7 its shadows in a summer's afternoon, and we are content. And all about here are spots of gen tle beauty which we cannot stay to talk about \u2014 the woods of Dalhousie, the old Abbey of Newbattle, the Palace of Dal keith, the home of \"bold Buccleuch,\" and how many more we cannot tell.

Besides all this, he possessed, by nature, both a mind and manner superior to his station ; yet in that station he was happy ; and although it was sufficiently humble, he w*ould not have exchanged it for an empire.

We shall dream his dream over again, and look upon that picture of pastoral life which he has given us, \u2014 taking it, however, in the simple narrative form which is given in Wilson's \" Tales of the Borders \" : \u2014 The person (Symon Scott, a wealthy and excellent man) with whom Patie resided, and with whom he had lived ever since he w7as a child, was a tenant of Sir William Preston's, a gentleman of large landed property, who, to save his head \u2014 he having taken an active part with the royalists of the period \u2014 had fled his native country, and was now abroad, no one knew where. Happy in his situation, and delighted with the natural beauties, which he could well appreciate, of the romantic district in which he lived, with its hills and its dales, its woods, and waterfalls, and limpid streams \u2014 Patie's felicity was yet more increased by a virtuous, well placed, and fondly-requited attachment. In his neighbourhood there lived a modest and beautiful girl of the name of Peggy Forsyth, of the same humble rank in life with himself. This girl was the reputed niece of Glaude Anderson, a respectable farmer, and a tenant also of Sir William's. But, though reputed the niece of this person, Peggy was, in truth, no relation to him whatever. \" Patrick, or Patie, as he was familiarly called by his compeers, was an humble shepherd lad, born and bred in the Lothians in Scotland, and within a few miles of Edinburgh. Patie, who lived about the middle of the seventeenth cen tury, was a remarkably handsome young man, and surpassed in all those rustic The girl was a foundling, and honest"], [85, "THE SCENE AND STORY OF THE GENTLE SHEPHERD. O) Glaude, her guardian, was, in reality, as ignorant of the circumstances of her birth and of her parentage as was the child herself. He had found her, one summer morning, carefully wrapped up in swaddling clothes, at his own door ; and being a kind-hearted man, he had adopted the little stranger; and to rivet, as it were, the affection he soon formed for her, he bestowed on her the title of propinquity alluded to; and neither the girl herself nor the world ever knew anything to the contrary. And on this girl Patie's love was fixed, to her his heart was given, and to him she yielded hers in return. While the young people were thus joyously engaged on the green, an old man of venerable appearance, but whose dress bespoke him a mendicant, sud denly presented himself amongst them, and began to amuse them by telling their fortunes; a branch* of business which he appeared to have added to his regular calling \u2014 that of soliciting cha rity. The knowledge, however, which the old man discovered of many circum stances connected with those whose future destinies he affected to foretell, greatly surprised all who heard him, and made such an impression on Jenny, Glaude's daughter, that she rushed breathless into the house, where the old people were enjoying themselves, and informed them that a most extraordinary old man, the most amazing fortune teller that ever was seen or heard of, had come amongst them, and was now on the green in front of the house. Thus stood matters with Patie and Peggy, when intelligence arrived that Sir William, who had now been absent for many years, might soon be expected home, as the king had been restored and the royal party was once more dominant. These agreeable tidings created the most lively sensations of joy amongst Sir William's tenantry, by all of whom he was greatly beloved for his generosity of character and pleasing condescension of manners. But to none of those who acknowledged him as their lord did this news afford such happiness as to old Symon Scott and Glaude Anderson, who had always been especial favourites of the good Sir William. The moment these two worthy men heard the tidings of their landlord's expected return, they simultaneously bethought them of cele brating the event with a feast, each insisting- that he should be the giver. Glaude, however, had .been forestalled in this particular by Symon, who had already given ordersfora sumptuous ban quet to be prepared, to which he invited Glaude, and all the old and young folk in his immediate neighbourhood. The feast over, youngsters, male and female, amongst whom were Patie and Peggy, betook themselves to the green in front of the house, to conclude the festivities of the day by a dance. Symon \u2014 all kindness and hospitality, and resolved that no one should go past his door hungry that day \u2014 desired Jenny to bring the old man in, protesting, how ever, at the same time, that he had no faith whatever in the soothsayer's pre tended gift of divination \u2014 a protest in which he was cordially joined by Glaude. In a few seconds, Jenny returned, leading in the old man, who was cordi ally welcomed by Symon, and immedi ately offered entertainment and a night's lodging. In gratitude for his kindness, the old man inquired if his host had no children, whose future fortunes he de sired to learn ; saying, at the same time, that he would exert his utmost skill to perform his task faithfully, whether it should be for good or evil. To humour what he considered at best a joke, Symon pointed to Patie, who, with some of the other youngsters, had now entered the house; and said that he was the only child he had. On this, the old mendicant took hold of Patie's hand, and to the great alarm of Symon's wife, told his auditors that"], [86, "70 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. invited to place himself at the board, and to partake of some refreshment. This hospitality, however, he begged his entertainers to delay for awhile, saying, he would rather go abroad for a little, and enjoy the calm air of the evening, and requested that his host, Symon, would accompany him ; a request w7ith which the latter readily complied. there was a particular mark on the young man's body, just below the arm pit \u2014 an assertion which was so true, that Symon's wife, who was the only person besides Patie himself who knew of such a mark, immediately accused the old fortune teller of having dealings with the Evil One. Paying no attention to this remark, the prophet went on to say, that, if the young man was spared, he would, in a very short time, become a great and wealthy landlord. On leaving Symon's house, the old man directed his steps towards the deserted and dilapidated mansion of Sir William Preston, which was in the immediate neighbourhood; and, as they approached it, asked his companion to whom it belonged. He was told; and was further informed that the joyful tidings had come amongst Sir William's tenantry that he would soon be with them again. But what was honest Symon's joy \u2014 what his amazement \u2014 to find, as he did at this moment, that the event he announced as approaching, and to which he looked forward with so much delight, had already taken place! All, except Symon, treated this an nouncement with mirthful expressions of distrust, and none with more marked disbelief and contempt than Patie him self, who said that two whistles and a couple of curs were all his property, and likely ever to be. It has been said that Symon presented the only exception to the general in credulity on this occasion, although he was the first to express disbelief in the prophet's supernatural pow7ers ; but for this there was sufficient reason, as shall afterwards appear. Hastily throwing off the disguise that concealed him, the old mendicant \u2014 the wandering fortune teller \u2014 in an instant stood before the almost incredulous eyes of his humble but faithful friend, Symon, Sir William Preston himself, and none other. The change in Symon's sentiments regarding the old man's gifts, did not escape the notice of his friend, Glaude, who bantered him on his altered tone, and expressed the utmost astonishment that he should allow himself to be im posed upon by such absurdities. This open contempt of his fidelity instantly called down upon Glaude a rebuke from the soothsayer, who not only insisted on the soundness of his prediction, but added chat they would see that all he had foretold regarding Patie would be fulfilled ere two short days should elapse. Seeing the earnestness of the fortune teller, Glaude good humouredly not only gave up the point, but asked him to predict the future fortunes of his own two daughters ; a task, this, which the old man declined, alleging that he had the gift of prophecy only once a day. Astonished and delighted beyond measure at the extraordinary discovery, honest Symon flung himself on the ground, and, in a transport of joy, clasped Sir William's knees, and wel comed him to his home. The good knight kindly raised the old man ; and, embracing him affectionately, asked for Ids boy. Here our story requires a slight digression. When Sir William, who was a widower, fled his native land to avoid the vengeance of the popular party, he had, previous to his departure, secretly consigned his only son, then a child, to the guardianship of his faithful tenant, Symon, with instructions, however, that neither the boy himself, nor any one else, Having now exhausted his store of prediction, the mysterious visitor was"], [87, "TIIE SCENE AND STOP Y OF THE GENTLE SHEPHERD. 71 should ever be informed of his real descent \u2014 a course which Sir William was induced to pursue at once to save his son unavailing regrets in after life, should he never be able to recover his rights for him, and to reconcile him to the humble duties of the lowly station to which it was more than probable he should be, during his lifetime, doomed. It need hardly now be told, that Patie, Symon's protegee, was no other than the son and heir of Sir William Preston, and that it was of him Sir William now inquired. which that important circumstance en titled him\u2014 rapidly spread around, and created a universal feeling of surprise, and no small joy, as Patie had been a g-eneral favourite. But there was one on whom this intelligence had. a very contrary effect to that of inspiring joy. This was Peggy., In the discovery that her Patie was no longer the humble shepherd that had won her heart, the warm-hearted girl saw the utter anni hilation of all her fondest and dearest hopes, and gave w7ay to feelings of the deepest despair; for she dared not think otherwise than that she and her lover should now be sundered for ever. But, in coming to this conclusion, she had not made sufficient allowance for the strength of Patie's attachment, nor for the gene rous and noble nature of his character, which would not permit him to find, in a mere change of worldly circumstances, an apology for broken vows. But, in truth, it required no considerations of a moral kind to induce Patie to keep faith with his lover ; his affection for her alone was all sufficient for this purpose, and determined him to remain faithful to her, whatever might be the consequences. Abiding in this resolution, and deter mined to act up to it, he fled to his beloved Peggy, whom he found in tears and in despair, to assure her that the change in his condition had not effected, and never would effect, any change in his sentiments towards her, and that, as the son and heir of Sir William Preston, he should remain as constant to his love as if he had continued to be the humble shep herd who had wooed and won her heart. To all the inquiries which the latter now made of Symon regarding his son, he received the most pleasing and grati fying replies ; and was delighted to learn, amongst other things, that his education had been carefully attended to. Satisfied of this, and with other par ticulars regarding the conduct, character, and acquirements of his boy, Sir Wil liam next anxiously inquired if his son had formed no attachment unbefitting the station which he was now about to assume. On this important point, Symon ac knowledged that he feared the worst, as he had lately discovered, he said, that there existed a kindlier feeling between the young man and Glaude's niece, Peggy, than he approved of; but added that he hoped the change of condition which now awaited Patie, would induce him to break off the connection, and think no more of his lowly lover; and in this hope he was very eagerly joined by Sir William, who now desired Symon to bring his son to him, and to intimate openly, to all whom it concerned, that he w7as returned. On the day following these events, several persons, and, amongst them, Peggy, having assembled at Symon's house, where Sir William was sojourning for the time, the latter, attracted by the singular beauty of Patie's lover, whom he did not know by sight, and forcibly struck by the strong resemblance which he fancied she bore to his own sister, There being now no longer any reason for concealing Patie's real descent, the intelligence that the humble shepherd was no other than the son and heir of Sir William Preston \u2014 and, in conse quence of his father's return, was now about to step into the elevated station to"], [88, "IICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 72 Mause proceeded to say that, when Pegg-y was an infant, she was informed, by a person on whom she had every reliance, that the child's life, her parents being dead, was threatened by an uncle's wife, in order to come at the large'pro perty to which she was heir, and between which and this avaricious and unnatural relative the infant was the only obstacle. That, having a perfect assurance of this atrocious design, she stole away the child from its faithless guardians, Peggy's uncle and his wife, and having carried it, by easy stages of a few miles each day, at length arrived with her tender charge in that part of the country where they now were. Being afraid of a dis covery if she retained the child, she then determined on the step which put the infant into Glaude's possession. But, though soon satisfied that the child was in safe and good keeping, she resolved still to watch over it, and with this view took a small cottage in the neighbour hood, where she had lived ever since, and where, unknown to Peggy herself, or to anyone else, she had watched over her with all the anxiety of a mother. eagerly inquired who she was. Glaude, who was present, replied that she was his niece; but instantly after contra dicted himself, by confusedly saying she was not his niece. The honest man was, in truth, perplexed at the moment with two opposing considerations, and farther ed astray by the force of habit. He had called Peggy his niece on this occasion, because he had long accustomed him self to give her that title, and, indeed, to view her in the light of such a relative ; but he, at this moment, felt that Sir William had a right to expect the truth from him ; and on this, indeed, the knight now somewhat peremptorily in sisted, when Glaude acknowledged that Peggy was a foundling, and proceeded to describe the circumstances connected with the finding of the infant, which have been already told; but more than these, Glaude said he could not tell. The in formation, however, in which Glaude was deficient, was, to the astonishment and delight of all present, more especially to that of Sir William, whose curiosity was greatly excited, furnished on the spot, a.id from a very unexpected quarter. No sooner had Glaude finished his account of the foundling, than an old woman of the name of Mause Templeton, who was present, seizing Peggy by the hand, led her up to Sir William, and asked the knight if age had effected such a change on her countenance that he did not recognise in her the nurse of his sister \u2014 the nurse of the mother of the girl sne now held by her hand. After a moment's pause, Sir WTilliam acknow ledged his perfect recollection of her; and seeking no further testimony than her assurance, added to his own con \\ictions, from the likeness he had dis cerned, that the girl who stood before him was indeed his niece, he tenderly embraced her and made her take a seat beside him, until he should hear from Mause a detail of trie circumstances mat had entailed such a singular fate When Mause concluded her story, Patie, now Mr. Patrick Preston \u2014 who had been present during the whole of this singular and interesting scene \u2014 flew towards Peggy, and at once perceiving that the discovery which had just been made of her real parentage must remove every objection which his father could possibly entertain to their union, he em braced her, when they both knelt before Sir William and besought his blessing-, which the delighted father and uncle readily gave; intimating, at the same time, his determination to lose no time in stripping Peggy's unnatural relations of their ill-got gains, and restoring them to their righttul owner. And now, if ever unalloyed felicity was the lot of man, it was at this moment that of Palij the Gentle Shepherd, whose union witn Peggy, we need hardly add, immedi- on his niece. ately followed.\""], [89, "A TYPICAL SCOICH TOWN. 73 A Typical Scotch Town ADDINGTON is in some re- spects a typi- cal Scotch town. Its situa- tion is retired, and off the line of communica- so slowly as they do on this line. But let us proceed to particulars. The county of Haddington consists of the Tyne Valley. The ground rises from the river to the Lammermuir hills on the south, and to the lesser chain of the Garleton hills on the north. Beyond these the land slopes gently to the sea. Round the coast line there are a great many places of interest \u2014 Prestonpans, where the battle that made the 45' formidable was fought; Dirleton, \"the pleasantest dwelling in the kingdom ; \" North Berwick, The Bass, Tantallon \u2014 of which two last it may be safely said that they have more historical memories about them than all the rest of the county put together \u2014 and Dunbar, w7ith its story of a famous battle. In the Tyne Valley the interest is not nearly so strong. There are, indeed, places of note, but this is because Scotland is a country where every place has its his tory. But the localities are not specially famous. This in one way is an advan tage. The Tyne Valley is almost neg lected by the tourist tribe. It is not very convenient to get at, and when you are once there, there is nothing very special to do. The new railway route has followed the chief lines of historical interest, and the human stream runs strong and deep round the valley, but not through it. tion. There are no manu factories ; the surrounding country is purely agricul tural. The population is almost stationary, and so is the town. No doubt here, as elsewhere, the old order changeth, giving place to the new, but it does so very slowly and almost im- perceptibly. Drummond applied the term tortoise-like to the river on which Haddington is built, and the name might be applied to town and inhabitants, for both they and their ways are decidedly tortoise-like. In an age of hurry ana bustle like our own, it is well that there should be such places. We do not know that Mr. Ruskin ever w7as there, but if he has not been, he ought to go; and if he once went he would, or ought to be, charmed. It is in many things the very ideal he has laboriously elaborated through the hundreds of pages of Fors Clavigera\u2014a. place where the people directly or indirectly live by agriculture, and where new ways, if admitted at all, are admitted under protest. It is un fortunately true that the railway has penetrated to Haddington, but then it is only a branch line, and it is subdued and harmonised, so to speak, to keep it in \" tone \"with the general aspect of things. It also is tortoise-like. Out of Spain it is not probable that any trains move Haddington is a very old town, and yet not so old as many places in the neighbourhood. This we infer from the etymology of the name. It evidently means the town of Hada; and Hada, we presume, was some ancient Saxon chief who established himself here, with a band of followers. They looked upon the land and saw it was good, and so possessed it. The name is Saxon, and there is no evidence that the town was u"], [90, "74 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. the full perfection of the scene being fulfilled exactly when it suits him to come there; but still scenery that will be come more beautiful every time it is seen, because each time new beauties are revealed, and the old ones shine with greater lustre. occupied earlier than in Saxon times. Many of the names of places near are Celtic, and this of necessity implies an earlier origin. Still, as we say, the town is very old. It has a charter from Robert the Bruce, and its municipal constitution was in full order in times long before America was heard of, when Constantinople was still a Christian city, and the empire of the East flourished, and the afterwards formidable Turk had not yet established himself in Europe. We have heard an etymology of the name, more fanciful and ingenious than credible, which makes it out to mean the \"hidden town.\" This is not incor rect as a description. As you approach it from the west it is hidden by trees, from which the tall spire of the town house is seen emerging. But this is only on one side, for from the hilly slopes which lie north and south it is visible from some distance. The best view is that from these slopes, probably from the somewhat steep descent of the Garleton hills, little more than a mile away. It is (let us suppose) a summer evening. The sun is setting, and throwing a red light on the houses that lie at your feet. There is some smoke, not very much, hanging over the town, but even smoke is beautiful in the evening light, and the cloud is like a glory such as one sees over the heads of the saints in the old pictures. The river steals quietly along between grey walls, and then in a little between green fields.' The square tower of the Abbey rises in solemn grandeur over the meaner erections. There are trees mixed with the houses. The view be hind is shut in by the Lammermuir hills. What more of its kind do you want? There is nothing grand in all this. No great erections, no snow-covered mountains, no very strong colour even, as you have it in the English landscape. But there is a great deal, of what is quiet and soothing and restful. Little for the hasty tourist to enjoy, for he cannot count on all the conditions requisite for There is, we confess, something de lusive in such scenes. They promise peace. To live here is to live \"far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife.\" A life here is free from the cares and anxieties of existence in the great centres of the world's activity. This is, as one acknowdedges after a moment's thought, a delusion and a snare. Small towns everywhere, and in Scotland most of all, are scenes of angry and petty strife. Did we enter this apparent abode of peace, we should probably find that there is the usual bitter disputes about petty local affairs, the usual magnifica tion of trifling theological differences, as if they were the most important things under or over the sun, and the usual profound conviction that those who differ from you in opinion are actuated by the very worst motives, and want little to be downright rascals. Then the society of small towns might furnish many materials for sketches half pitiful, half comical. The minute divisions and subdivisions between professional men of one rank and professional men of another; between large grocers and small grocers ; between wine merchants and whisky merchants, and so on ad infinitum, would require a book of etiquette to describe fully. We shall not attempt it. Let us confess that all this is part of the nature of things, and that from some elevated standpoint it would not be more absurd than the distinctions between those in and those out of the charmed circle of society in a great capital. Little towns have their advantages in some ways. One is, that they develop individual characteristics much more fully than large cities.

On one of these occa sions a servant maid is said to have been the cause of the disaster, through some carelessness when she was attending to a child. The town council met after the calamity, and sagely came upon this resolution, which is about as fine an ex ample of locking the door after the steed was stolen, as is to be found on re cord. They determined that the bell man should henceforward perambulate the streets every evening, and after ringing the bell should recite a rhyme, to the effect that all \"nourices who had bairns to keep\" should \"keep coal and canel for charite,\" and be very careful of how they scattered fire about under the penalty of current rubs off all the corners of a man's nature. One Cockney is as like another as if they were both turned out by the same machine. So rocks that are con stantly exposed to the action of a steady flow of water are in time worn perfectly smooth. But here men's peculiarities are developed without check. Whim sicalities and eccentricities are almost encouraged to exhibit themselves, and the result is what is called in the North \" a character,\" whose modes of life and thought and speech are peculiar, sometimes absurd and silly, not unfre quently humorous and interesting. It is \u2022only when we peer into the inner life of such places that their quarrels and passionsbecomeevident. Tothe passing traveller the external peaceful aspect of the town seems to reproduce itself in the internal appearance. The main streets are deserted at noon in summer. One or two people may indeed be seen sauntering with the usual tortoise motion up and down, without much definite aim or purpose, as far as appears to the onlooker. This the traveller calls dull, restful, or refreshing, as it suits his par ticular point of view. At night the town is early to bed. At hours when the pulse of life is beating with full throb in great towns, here the streets are deserted, and even the lights in the houses out. Loosing o' their guid renown And banishing frae this burrows town. This custom is no longer kept up. When one reads of these things, and reflects for a little on them, one begins to think how people must have suffered in those days. Had they any enjoyment in life at all, when any day might bring them to a violent and untimely end? If you dig under the ground now in any direction round about the town, you come upon human remains; the very verdure of the fields about is that which got its first strength from the dead. Haddington gives one the impression of a place that has always been peaceful, but this is not so, as a glance at its history will show. Not many towns in Scotland have suffered more. It is said to have been made a royal burgh by David I., and must have been a place of\" considerable importance, for there used to be an appeal to the Chamber lain at Haddington from the decisions of some of the burgh courts. In 1548 it was fortified by Lord Grey of Wilton, the English commander, but besieged in the following year by the Scotch and their French auxiliaries, who finally forced the garrison to aban- Haddington compares favourably with other towns of the same size. Its streets are comparatively wide, and its houses, built of solid stone, if neither imposing nor pretentious, are substantial and com fortable. What few public buildings are to be found in such a place, are erected on suitable sites, and are in thorough keeping with the other aspects of the place. The great building about Had dington is the Abbey Church. It dates from the thirteenth century. It is the Lucema Laudonia,. he lamp of glory of Lo thian, and w7hether, as some have doubted, the original Lucerna Laudoni\u00e6 or not, D\u00ab"], [92, "76 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. it now worthily fulfils that office. One part of it is a ruin, the other is still used as a parish church. The whole is now preserved with a care that makes some amends for centuries of neglect. Not only was the church neglected; it was disfigured. Two doors were knocked in the walls, where certainly no doors should have been. Such restoration as the edifice now admits of, will not be complete till these are filled up, and the wall restored, as far as possible, to its original condition, and till the somewhat unsightly pews and gallery in the interior are removed and replaced by fittings more in accordance with the nature of the building. The church lies quite close to the river, which sometimes rises, and, on several occasions, has not only flooded it, but the whole ofthe town. The story runs that one of these inunda- tions took place on Christmas Eve, 1358. \" The river, swollen by excessive rains, rose above the bank, and swept away many villages, houses, and bridges, and many persons lost their lives whilst en- deavouring to save their property \u2014 not only cattle, but tall oaks and other large trees were torn up by the roots, and car- ried off to sea. Sheaves of corn were borne away from the adjacent fields.\" When the water rose about the Abbey, and threatened finally to tear away the solid structure from its foundations, and hurl it along, a nun, one of the inmates, lost patience, and seizing an image of the Virgin, threatened that it first should feel the effects of the flood, unless the water ceased to rise. Immediately the storm began to abate, and in an incredibly small space of time the Tyne returned to its ordinary channel. In a small erec- tion to the north of the church is the Lauderdale vault. Here lie the remains of John, Duke of Lauderdale \u2014 the bloody Lauderdale of the \" killing time.\" The body is enclosed in a heavy leaden coffin, and it is said that each time the vault is opened \u2014 which is for the most part when one of the family dies \u2014 the coffin is found turned rudely over, as if it had received some violent shock. There are several theories to account for this. Some aver that the vault is regularly flooded several timesevery winter; others say that the evil one is the cause, though why that last-named individual should not make a clean sweep of the business by removing the \"bloody duke\" at once and for ever, does not seem quite clear. A more romantic, though dimmer legend is, that on the night when one of the Lauderdale family dies, a coach of fire is seen rapidly moving through the air from the family seat to the old church. The grave of Thomas Carlyle's wife is in the ruined part of the Abbey. If one might choose one's burial place, it surely would be here. The Tyne is within a stone' s-throw, and you distinctly hear its murmur and the rustling ofthe leaves on the willow-trees that line its banks. Around are crumbling walls and broken pillars, beautiful even in decay, for Time, though it has taken their strength, has left their loveliness. The voices of children at play and the song of birds float in, audible but softened. All around are old gravestones, whose in scriptions are well-nigh illegible; the very dust is human mould. It is hot out side, but here it is calm and cool, for the broken walls throw a perpetual shadow on the narrow space. To sit here is to rest \u2014 to lie here must be ; so it seems to human fancy \u2014 to rest for ever. As long as Carlyle lived, and was able to move, he came down here every year topay a visit to his wife's grave. The bent figure, the sad, powerful face, the very stride became objects that were well enough known to the townsfolk, and, with considerable complacency, they cherished the belief that at some (it was, they hoped, distant) time the two would be laid here. The spot might well have formed a last haven for one whose life had been full of so much sorrow, and toil, anil struggle.

We have to go back for this; but our pains would be well nigh in vain, were it not for one famous case. We need hardly tell our readers that the great name about Haddington is that of John Knox. Unfortunately, even this solitary distinction is one which the town is not allowed to have uncontested. John Knox, it is said, was born in the Gifford-gate, and this all who belong to Haddington are ready to swear was the Gifford-gate of Haddington, or the gate on the road from Haddington that leads to Gifford. But then it is equally a point of honour for the inhabitants of Gifford, a small village about four miles from Haddington, to swear that Gifford gate was the gate of Gifford. The peo ple of Haddington show the site of the house where Knox was born in the exact spot of the Gifford-gate; but then the inhabitants of Gifford have their spot equally ready in the gate of Gifford. Nor are the historians unanimous, for whilst Dr. MCrie has declared in favour of Gifford, Mr. David Laing, having gone carefully over the evidence, pronounces in favourof Haddington, on grounds which it would seem hopeless to dispute. The spot where the house is said to have stood is just opposite the church on the other side of the river. The stately fabric of the abbey must have been the most familiar of objects to his eyes when a boy. Perhaps the fascination of its appearance had something to do with turning his thoughts to ecclesiastical affairs, and help him to form the resolu tion to become a priest \u2014 a resolution which had afterwards consequences so momentous for Scotland. There is another disputed birthplace near Had dington of a poet not quite forgotten, ibr We have said that the ridge of the Garleton hills lies to the north of Had dington. ' The road goes straight up from the town over the brow of the hill, then as straight down the other side. The elevation is there somewhat steep, but the ground soon falls into a plain, and then gently declines towards the sea. It is at the spot where the plain begins that Garleton Castle stands on a slight eminence. It is a ruin among ruins, for, never of great extent, a mere part of a shell is all that now remains to it. Round it is a farm \"toun,\" and the inhabitants have utilised it for all sorts of purposes \u2014 a few pig-sties among other things being fitted up in the ruinous old keep. The muse has as little, as of old, been able to do anything for her \" en chanting son,\" since this is the birthplace of Sir David Lindsay, as the weight of evidence leads us to believe. We have already said that Hadding ton is the centre of a great agricultural district. From the beginning of the pre sent century, till within the past few years, East Lothian agriculture has, on the whole, been held to be the best in Scotland. This was not so much due to the natural fertility of the soil, as to the enlightened enterprise of its cultivators. All the chief improvements which modern times have made in the science and art of agriculture, were adopted here with out delay. In summer time, in a favour able year, the county has the aspect of a well cultivated garden. This is in keeping with the quiet and peaceful character of the natural scenery. We have already remarked on the compara tively modern character of the admira tion for mountain scenery ; but there is nothing new in the admiration for scenery such as this. In the Psalms the ideas of joy are expressed by vales glad with corn, and hills clothed with pastures, and of this kind of pastoral scenery, East Lothian is the very perfection.

It is better, then, to ascend cautiously, for you cannot see the holes, so thick is the growth of nettles. If you put your foot in one, down you go \u2014 not of necessity breaking either your neck or your leg, but still to come down headforemost among nettles is not the most agreeable sensation in the world\u2014 especially as there are little pieces of bare rock scattered in all directions \u2014 so what part of you is not broken is bruised. We never saw such a place for stones as this hill. It looks solid enough, but it must be speedily crumbling away. \" Every little makes a miekle,\" and every stone rolled from the top of Traprain Law lowers its height ; but as there is no use being troubled about what may happen in so many thousand years, let us say no more. If the reader has not been here, he will be surprised to learn that he is at the top, or very near it. The ascent does not take more than a quarter of an hour or so \u2014 why should it? \u2014 the hill is only 700 feet high. Still, there is some advantage in climbing little hills. The exertion is not so great jts to over-fatigue you, and so put you out of humour. The view is probably as good as is to be obtained from more lofty summits. Here, if the day be clear, you .-may see nearly the whole ofthe Lothians, and part of Fife. It is best in harvest time, when the fields are all loaded with grain \u2014 half of it cut, and half not \u2014 and the whole scene is one of cheerful activity. You have the finest back ground to your picture \u2014 the sea and the hills. At various distances are little towns and villages nestling in the trees; further off is the bold outline of Arthur's Seat, and the cloud of smoke under which lie the houses of Edinburgh. The Tyne runs by your feet, and you can follow its course from where it enters the field of vision far away on the west, to where it runs into the sea, for it flashes silver in the sunlight and twists like a gleaming coil through the fields. The edge of the coast is marked with a line of white, for it is a breezy day, and the same wind that causes that white line blows on you with a stronger, freer, more impertinent and familiar way than it did in the plain half-an-hour ago. It has fanned your face all the way up but now it blows wild and free, and moves the nettles and the grass about, here and there, making them rustle incessantly. It does not roar, though, for it has nothing very heavy to toss about. There are no trees on Traprain Law.. Does the wind blow in that iree and independent way in conquered countries, you wonder, or could slaves feel it so blowing and still be slaves, or is it reserved for \"the hills where the slave never trod? \" The river, we have said, flows past you. It washes the base of the hill. If you look down you see it at your feet, and there is the old castle of Hailes beside it. Hailes is built on a piece of land which projects out a little way into the Tyne. A part of it is sheer with the water, which is here somewhat deeper than ordinary. Like nearly all the old castles of Scotland, it is a mere shell.. The loss of the perception of the beauti ful, and the want of reverence for antiquity, were apparently the price at which it was found necessary to purchase theReformation, and for manya long day not merely churches were closed, but old towers were altered to suit the most temporary purposes. If a barn was re quired the old castle furnished an excellent storehouseof stones. But there is one compensation. It is at a certain stage of this process of ruin that you get the most beautiful effect. Inside the great hall of Hailes Castle there is seen a great green mound. The narrow open ings pierced in the side ofthe wall show you only the water and a very limited extent of field. Covering there is none, for the whole place lies open to the sky. And in one part some fresh and vigorous trees grow in between and among the"], [97, "ROUND AND OVER TRAPRAIN LAW. 81 grey stones. There are still some rem nants from which we can trace part ofthe life ofthe people that once dwelt within these walls. Behind is the garden -of the castle. The ground is very luxuriant, and is quite covered with fruit bushes. It is but moderately well kept, which is a blessing. A trim garden in such a place would be an anachronism. There is the rivulet that supplied the castle with water, and perhaps some dim traces of a well. On the east side is the courtyard, an open space on a bank by the side of the river. It is pleasant to lie here in what was the great hall, on a summer afternoon, when the sounds of distant labour mingle -with the gentle voice of the river that laps the foot of the bank on which you \u2022rest. You are protected from the wind, and you can indulge in the longest day dream without much chance of distur bance. Hailes is a long way from the regular road, and not quite close to any \u25a0road at all. The excursionist knows it not, and the few rustics of the locality have something else to do than pay visits to the old ruin, unless they come -with sacrilegious hand to pilfer the sacred remains. You are deeply hidden in the hollow of the valley, and you might pitch your tent there for a fair number of days without much chance of discovery. pent her rash haste, and did she soon perceive, in the intimate and unguarded intercourse of daily life, with what sort of fellow she had mated herself? There would be no end \u2014 there is little profit, in these reflections. Let us betake our selves back to the Law, from which we have somehow or other got down. To go up again we must not go straight ahead, but a little round, for the sides nearer us almost deserve the name of precipices; but there is a tale connected with these precipices, and that tale, which it is the main purpose of this article to tell, is now at last reached. We have still another word to premise, for it must be known that Traprain Law has an older, and indeed a very much finer sounding name \u2014 Dumpender, to wit, and our story belongs to Celtic Scotland, and to the days when Traprain was not, and Dumpender ruled in his stead. In pagan times there lived in these parts a king called Leudonus. He was great and mighty, and from him the county is called Lothian even to this day. Leu donus was not by himself a bad sort ol a man, but he had married twice (if we can apply that name to the free and easy pagan process), and his second wife was by no means a saint. She was especially given to persecuting Thaney, who was her stepdaughter. Now Thaney had in secret been converted to Christianity, but after a little time she avowed this, and moreover announced her intention of not marrying any one, but taking the veil and spending the rest of her days as a nun. At this time one \" Ewen, the son of Ewegende, sprung from the most noble stock of the Britons,\" was pressing* for her hand, and her father was much in his favour, so that he received the news of his daughter's determination with demonstrations of the utmost ill-will. But it was all in vain ; nothing could alter the resolution of the daughter. Now there was a swineherd who lived at the bottom of Dumpender Law, and he, as the meanest man in the kingdom, was Quiet as Hailes Castle now seems, it holds a most unquiet memory. It was \u2022once in the possession of the Earl of Bothwell, and it is here he took Mary for some short time after that mad abduction which led by an almost neces- sary chain of events to the humiliation of Loch Leven and the final agony of Fotheringay. One wonders if the quiet of the place soothed her then as it soothes us now. Did she wander in some of those shady paths by the side \u2022of the river? Did she climb the hill over head to look for the place where she knew Holyrood lay? Or was she occupied with other things ? Had she already begun, as we know she soon did, to re-"], [98, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 82 king, \"if she be worthy of life, her God will free her from the peril of death, if so He will.\" So they carried her down to Aberbessie, or Aberlady, as it is now called, and there they put her on board such a boat, and \" the little vessel in which the unhappy girl was detained, ploughed the watery breakers and eddies of the waves towards the opposite shore more quickly than if propelled by a wind that filled the sail, or by the effort of many oarsmen.\" And when she came to the other shore, she landed, and there on the cold shore a son was born to her. Now the sainted Servanus wras at this time preaching the gospel to the natives of those parts, and he was warned by a vision of what was to happen, and that one who should be a patron to Britain, and luminary of the Church, was that day to be brought to him. So when the mother and child were brought to Servanus, he at once recog nised the fulfilment of his vision, and the child was baptised as Kycntyern. Such is the romantic story of the birth of St. Kentigern. summoned to court; and so was Ewen, and the king brought his daughter to the great hall of his palace, and point ing to them, said that if she did not marry Ewen she must go home with the swineherd and be his companion in his wretched hut, and help him in his servile occupation. But still Thaney would not yield, so the swineherd was directed to take her away with him, and he did so. But she soon found out that the swine herd was in secret a Christian, and so he treated her kindly and respectfully. And things went on very well for a little. Ewen was not satisfied with these pro ceedings, for he loved Thaney with a passionate love, so he set a snare for her, which at last succeeded. News was brought to the king at length that his daughter had been wronged, and he, though hehad turned her out of doors, was still jealous for the honour of the royal house, so he ordered that the law of the country should be carried out in her case, even though she was a king's daughter. Now the law was that she should be stoned to death; but none ofthe officers of the court would cast stones at her because she was of the royal blood, nor would the common people either. But they seized upon the man who had be trayed her and beheaded him. Still the rage of the king was not appeased, so he told the servants to seize her and throw her down from the top of Dum pender Law, over the precipitous side of the hill. And the servants did as they were commanded. She made the sign of the cross as they hurled her from so dreadful a height, and when they went round to the foot of Dumpender to take up and bury her remains, they found, to their great astonishment, that she was quite unhurt. So they took her up and again brought her to the king, and still he did not relent. But he could not venture to try and kill her again, so he commanded that she should be put in a little boat of hides, made after the fashion of the Scots, without any oar, \"For,\" said the But the shadow of the great mass on which we stand is moving across the fields longer and longer, and the reapers are going homewards, and we must follow their example. There are two ways by which we can return to the county town: one is higher, more breezy. and more cheerful ; the other is down in the hollow near the river, it is through rich fields of grass, and past frequent clumps of trees. They both join within a mile ofthe town, and this part of our walk is rather a curious one. The one side of the road is bounded by a some what high wall, and behind it is a wood of considerable extent. The trees are high, andtheirbranches protrude overthe wall. The other side is open, but for the greater part of the way a rise in the ground completely obstructs the view, which is thus confined both to right and left of you, within the space ofa few feet. Rising in front on the other side of the"], [99, "THE RIVER TYNE. 83 river, and towards the town, is the square mass of the old church tower, with the churchyard thickly dotted with grave stones. If we turn round, we see the hill we have left more than an hour ago quite close to us, as if it had travelled a bit of the way after us. It shuts in the road completely behind us. The whole has a somewhat eerie aspect, though it is only at one or two points on the way, and '\"twixt the gloaming and the mirk,\" that the full effect can be felt. At any rate, there is a certain sad ness about the road. To walk along it has a depressing effect. This is easily accounted for by its confined appear ance, which gives one the idea of being shut up. It is a by-path not very much used, and one rarely meets any one there. It lies deep in the shade, and this may have something to do with an effect which may appear a somewhat fanciful one. There is a sad story connected with the place to which the trees belong, and which the road runs round in a sort of semicircle, the diameter of which is formed by the river. It belonged, at one time, to a family of the name of Stanfield. The son, whose name was Philip Stanfield, murdered his father in a brutal manner, and from the basest of motives. Suspicion fell upon him ; he was arrested and tried on the charge. He was submitted to the ordeal of touch. The body of the mur dered man was laid out in the Abbey Church at Haddington, and the son was. obliged to approach and touch the corpse. He entered the sacred building pale as the dead man himself, and hardly able to stand. He tottered up to the bier, and laid his trembling hand on the senseless clay. But, says the story, it was not senseless ; the wounds opened and bled afresh at the touch of the parricide. There was no lack of other and more satisfactory, if more commonplace, evi dence. Young Stanfield was found guilty of the murder and executed. But enough, for the present, of dismal ways and dismal stories. The -River Tyne 'NE tortoise-like that flows,\" says Drummond suits with the character of the country through which it runs, or rather creeps. It is a quiet, pastoral district, cultivated, one might almost say, to excess, but with comparatively few inhabitants. The river is of a modest and retiring dis position, and shuns the haunts of men (this is rather putting the cart before the horse). Haddington is the only town on its banks, and there are hardly any villages. You may go miles along its banks and not meet a single person. You may see a gentleman's house on an eminence, or a cottage nearer the edge, but they might as well be deserted, for there is no sign of human life about them. of this northern river. Nothing could be more accurate, for the stream, not having- very far to go (its length being only about thirty miles), no doubt thinks it is well to take the matter leisurely. We will not go so far as to say that it is as torpid as the river men tioned in C\u00e6sar, which he describes as \" moving with such incredible slowness that the eye cannot perceive in which way it flows.\" There is something in its slow, peaceful motion that admirably"], [100, "84 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. little way below Haddington. Of the abbey itself not a vestige remains, although it was once an establishment of some pretensions. A small unfilled piece of ground yet preserves the memory of the graveyard ; but the plough has sadly encroached upon it. There is a mill there now, and a hamlet of somewhat ruinous houses. The bridge itself finishes one of those little stretches or bits of the river of which we have spoken. One edge of the stream is here lined by a wood of tall Scotch firs, that rise close up from the water's edge; the other is a green haugh lined with trees; behind it are fields, and behind these the Garleton Hills. A cascade makes a little turmoil some way up the river, but the water near the bridge recovers itself, and flows pla cidly on to the bridge, as if unconscious that some of it is to be immediately swept through a mill-race, and the other part turned rudely in white foam over a dam. It again collects its scattered forces, and, quiet and composed as before, murmurs gently over the pebbles that now line its. path. Here the water does not seem quite sufficient to fill its channel, for there are little islands and peninsulas. covered with trees and bushes, and long rank grass right in the middle of the water. The grass on the bank is also long and rank, and many a time you lose the pathway \u2014 here a very faint track \u2014 amidst the tangled undergrowth. The few wayfarers are not enough to make the way well beaten. At some points you may see people working in the* fields; but this does not necessarily bring them down here. The rustics likewise bear their part in the scene : their speech is slow and deliberate; they drawl out the words, and rest on the vowels so long, that they seem to have stuck. In walk they are heavy-gaited, tortoise-like we might say, but we do not wish \"to crack the wind of the poor phrase.\" Well, rustics are so all the world over. Their virtue is not speed, nor is deft agility their strong point.. AH rivers, we suppose, flow with a definite sound, and a nice ear could note an indivi dual tone in each. Mr. Ruskin has remarked on the charming and distinct \"note\" of the Scottish rivers, and cer tainly the Tyne has an individual sound of its own. Alder and willow trees and low bushes cover a great portion of the banks, and these bend their branches over into the stream, and the water moves the lower twigs constantly to and fro with a gentle rustle ; it laps the soft banks, too, in many a little swirl and eddy, and moves over many a gravelly bed. If you sit at some little distance from the edge, all these sounds come mixed into one murmur, with a very distinct individuality. Gentle and plead ing and pathetic is the utterance \u2014 a song in fit keeping with the scenes the course of the river continually discovers. For the most part it bends a good deal, and this forms a con tinual succession of distinct pictures. None of these are sublime or grand or terrible; they are not even very strongly marked with colour, but there is a certain dreamy and tender love liness, a beauty which has much ofthe spirituelle in it, and which grows imper ceptibly upon one. What human hands have done has been, on the whole, to add grace to the prospect. Time has co-operated with them. Sometimes the river flows past an old castle like that of Hailes, \"majestic though in ruin.\" Again, there are some fine old country houses standing a little way from the side. Now it is an old bridge spanning the stream, and again a peasant's cot nestling on the banks. One or two of these bridges are charming They are of unknown antiquity, narrow and steep, yet with a graceful sweep of the arch. The piers they are built on have sunk low into the soft ground. Here and there a stone is displaced. The water always collects here a little deeper than ordinary, and it lies dark and cool in the hollow. Such a bridge is the Abbey Bridge, a"], [101, "THE RIVER TYNE. 85 In them we may rather expect steady, if slow perseverance, \" stay,\" and power of endurance. The East Lothian peasant compares very favourably with the Dor set labourer. He is honest and careful ; pious according to his light, with an appetite for knowledge, and a wish to impart a good education to his children. The old Scottish peasant is becoming a rare character. Natural causes have here quietly brought about thesame resultthat violent evictions have in the Highlands,and everywhere the purely rustic parishes of Scotland are quickly becoming depopu lated. There is less need for the people, for machines now do much of the work, and the folk themselves find it not for their interest to remain. They are but labourers here, they may be not only farmers, but proprietors, beyond the Atlantic. So-and-so, and So-and-so have gone, and are doing well, and so may they. And thus, year after year, they leave their fatherland, with some regret, no doubt. \" Sweet the fields the lost ones ploughed;\" sweet to dwell where our fathers have dwelt, and to look on the same scene with failing as with opening eyes. Sweeter, though, to be independent and well off. The prose of life is much more powerful than its poetry ; and thus the gentle murmur of Tyne is exchanged for the roar of mightier streams. The city life has its attractions for the countryman more and more. It means wealth and ease, and sine raiment and sumptuous fare. It is only when rest seems the one thing to be cared for, and the pulse of life beats slow, that such quiet scenery has a permanent charm for us. But when existence is full of fire and passion within, one feels that there ought to be dash and excitement without. The roar of the crowded street is more attractive than the sound of the water- fall: the quiet becomes dullness, and the slow, unvarying existence insupportable. of Tyne and its tributaries might deserve and repay some notice, for Salton makes us think of the Fletchers, Lethington of the Maitlands, Coalstoun of the Brouns, and their enchanted pear; but we pass on. Nor, as we have said so much about Hailes Castle, shall we go into this part of the subject. Yet Hailes is not the greatest of the old castles of the Tyne, for before the river enters East Lothian, \"Crichtoun Castle crowns the bank,\" as Scott tells us in \" Mar mion,\" and he goes on to describe the situation: \u2014 \u25a0 That castle rises on the steep Of the green vale of Tyne ; And far beneath, where slow they creep, From pool to eddy dark and deep You hear her streams repine. \" Her streams repine,\" \u2014 you see Scott caught the \"note\" of the river god, or perhaps river nymph, very well. The Tyne flows through the middle of Haddington, and gets, we are afraid, sadly dirtied in the \" by-gaing.\" The river-side is not clean. It is very much the contrary. It is a pity, for, in some ways, there is not a more picturesque bit on the river. Part of the old town wall still remains. It is grey and worn, and yet standing firm and strong. The houses, too, the backs of which are towards the river, are old ones. There are willow trees on the other side, and a road by them. Bothwell Castle \u2014 which is hardly a castle, but only an old town residence of a noble family \u2014 breaks the line of the wall. Up the river a little way is the Nungate Bridge, one of those ancient erections like the Abbey Bridge, already referred to. Above this, again, we come to the church and the haughs. The river is clearer here, and the walk by the waterside delightful. Here is a fine picture by a canoe voyager of the scene on a summer evening : \u2014 \"Round the haughs slowly we paddled, taking all the pleasure we could out of the delightful river bends and trees. But we are wandering a little from our theme. The country houses on the banks"], [102, "86 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. The white clothes' posts on the haughs cut the evening air; the old abbey church stood high in the graveyard above the gurgles and swirls of the mill dam and the ripple of the river; the swans w7ere nested in a bit of garden ground near the water, and the houses behind were hemmed in with bushes and flowers. And alongside the Nun gate, with its old deep coloured tiled houses taking on the last colour of the falling night, with their outside wooden stairs and whitewashed fronts and dyke along the riverside, built against spring floods, we glided, sorry at heart that the journey was here to terminate with the day and place. Quietly we slipped along, and the few labouring folk lounging at the bridge-end looked some what wearily and vaguely upon our un explained arrival and our strange way of travelling. At the last weir we stepped ashore.\" Standing on the Nungate Bridge at night, when we survey the scene \" by the struggling moonbeams' misty light,\" there is something grand in the rapid rush under the old arches, between the old walls, below and before us. But the river soon becomes tired of these excesses. It sinks into its old path, and resumes its old voice, and all things are soon as they were, for the damage done is not such as to leave permanent marks. We have already said that this part of the country has no great descriptive literature of its own. There are one or two pieces of writing about it worth reading, however. There is that charm ing description of it in Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's delightful book on Scottish rivers. He gives it \u2014 perhaps with some little impropriety \u2014 the epithet of \"golden, not only from the colour which the rich soil through which it runs imparts to it, but from the abundance of those golden harvests which are yielded on its lands.\" Like most gentle people, Tyne does become very violent when roused. It gets in a rage once in several years, and expresses its rage by a flood. Then its streams run swollen and red. The whole channel, which is usually only half occupied, is filled with a mass of turbid water, which hurries onward with angry swirl. It rises far on the banks, and, in passing the town, floods the low lying suburb of Nungate. From the fields it overflows it carries away all sorts of spoil. Great masses of rich red soil must be \"held\" in a somewhat imper fect state of solution, for it is this that gives the water its peculiar red appearance at such a time. From the woods it bears away all sorts of ferns and trees, great roots, logs, and branches ; sometimes it lays hold of an unfortunate sheep, and hurls it along too. Its plaintive voice is then exchanged for a deep, sullen, angry roar, which rises into passion as it pours over a dam, or dashes against bridges and walls. It is only on these rare occasions that it can be said to give us an imposing sight. Here, again, is a charming poem by Mr. Alexander Anderson, with which we shall conclude this article : \u2014 Flow, Tyne, throughout the meadow land, And underneath the woody shades, Where, in the summer time, a band Of children carol through the glades. They gather flowers from where they grow, Amid the grass with golden gleam, And weave them into crowns, or throw Their scented colours in the stream. * Then watch them dip and pass away, Like pilgrim thoughts to some far shrine ; And such are mine, this summer day, Who watch thee slip, and flow, and shine.

A^O miles from North description when we have the immortal picture by the author of \"Marmion\" before us ? \u2014 \u25a0 Berwick is the Castle of Tantallon, standing upon the summit of great rug- ged cliffs, and looking \"Tantallon vast, frowningly out to sea. Eroad, massive, high, and stretching far, And held impregnable in war. Nothing could present a On a projecting rock it rose, finer contrast than this And round three sides the ocean flows, The fourth did battled walls enclose, great warlike stronghold, grand even in its ruin, and the smiling, peaceful corn-fields which lie behind and about it. It stands upon a kind of peninsula, which a little stream, running eastward through a fair glen, combines with the sea to make. Its form and style, as it once had been, can only be faintly guessed from what remains. A solitary tower upon the south side tells where the outer court once stood; a ruinous archway indicates a passage between this outer court and the inner one, where most likely the horses were housed. In the interior is a huge quadrilateral tower, from which there stretches out to the verge of rock a \" solid curtain,\" as it is called in the guide-books, fifty feet high, ending in hi^-*^nvers, in each of which was, B'7 * a stair. Inside, the casiJP^so disposed as to indicate that it made, as it were, three sides of a square; and in the western wing- there are still remains enough to show a great banqueting-hall, and give pictures of the days that died long ago. But why blunder away at prosaic And double mound and fosse ; By narrow drawbridge, outworks strong, Through studded gates, an entrance long. To the main court they cross, It was a wide and stately square, Around were lodgings fit and fair, And towers of various form, Which on the coast projected far, And broke its lines quadrangular ; Here was square keep, there turret high, Or pinnacle that sought the sky, Whence oft the warder could descry The gathering ocean storm.' The castle is identified with the name of Douglas, though its earliest history is unknown. The Douglases obtained the barony* of North Berwick at the time of Robert II. 's accession; and from that time the grim fortress of Tantallon was their stronghold. In 1479 it passed into the hands of the Earl of Angus, other wise known as \"Bell-the-Cat.\" Readers of \"Marmion\" will remember how largely Angus figures in that beautiful poem. In council of war Angus had spoken strongly against the idea of risk ing battle at Flodden ; and James IV.,"], [104, "88 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. in a white heat, had contemptuously told him, if he was afraid, to go home. The aged counsellor, almost heart-broken at such language addressed to one so brave as he had been, took the king at his word, and returned to Tantallon. Thither King James allowed Marmion to retire for safe keeping ; and here for some time he remained, listening with sinking heart to the news of those small triumphs of the Scottish army which were so sadly corrected by the over throw of Flodden. At length Marmion could bear it no longer; it seemed \" death to his fame\" The old Douglas fire is now aflame, and burns furiously, as we can see : \u2014 \" And darest thou then To beard the lion in his den, The Douglas in his hall ? And hopest thou hence unscath'd to go? No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no ! Up drawbridge, grooms \u2014 what, Warder, ho ! Let the portcullis fall.\" And so Marmion bethinks himself that he cannot start a moment too soon. \" Lord Marmion turn'd, \u2014 well was his need, And dashed the rowels in his steed, Like arrow through the archway sprung, The ponderous grate behind him rung : To pass there was such scanty room, The bars, descending, razed his plume. \" \" If such a fray Were fought, and Marmion away ! \" Then comes the parting scene of the two proud noblemen, the venerable Angus and the young and brave Mar mion, at the gates of Tantallon. Mar mion offers his hand to the old chief, and it is refused; the king, he says, may send any one, even one who is not his peer, to Angus's castle, but Angus's hand is his own.

E have come now along the seashore to the haven castle, we are carried back through the centuries to see how again and again it has witnessed the changing fortunes of warfare, and been a bulwark against the \"foreign loon\" of which Scotland has had little need to be ashamed. of Dunbar. Not much of a tow7n, you say, or but a fishing village, and little more. Well, it is not very much more now : History tells how the old castle was defended in the 14th century by a brave lady of that time, the Countess of March, w7hile her husband was following the fortunes of David Bruce. The castle \u2014 then in its full strength, standing upon its line of rocks out to the very sea, and having only one entrance from the main land \u2014 was coveted by the Earl of Salis bury, who laid siege to it, and placed against it huge engines, from which great stones were hurled to break down its walls. \"Black Agnes\" \u2014 so the Countess was called \u2014 defended it, and to show her scorn of the power of Salis bury's missiles, she and her maids came forth to wipe with a napkin the places which had been assailed. save that yearly in the summer time the burgh and its small suburbs are filled with townspeople \u2014 from Edinburgh, most of them, and country people, too, farmer folk and their households who come to have their nine dips in the sea. Perhaps we should speak of its weekly market, too, w7hich brings into the town farmers and mer chants from all the country round, and where you might see in the season the richest grain produce which will be found in the three kingdoms. Your Lothian farmer, as you see him here, is no small man, no mere occupier of a little holding : he is not the rough yokel whose ungainly figure and uncouth manners many an effeminate city youth associates with the name. He is often a man of wealth and education, a gentle man who, in breeding and in culture alike, is superior to many of those city magnates who eat Lord Mayors' dinners, or claim to be mighty men on Liverpool or Manchester Exchanges. George Hope of Fenton-barns, an East Lothian farmer who died a few years ago, was a man whom princes did not scorn to visit, and who, though unsuccessful in a gallant fight for Parliamentary honours, would have compared favourably with the majority of those who find their way into the House of Commons. \"The Earl of Salisbury then com manded his engineers to bring forward to the assault an engine of another kind, being a sort of wooden shed, or house, rolled forward on wheels, with a roof of peculiar strength, which, from resem bling the ridge of a hog's back, oc casioned the machine to be called a sow. This, according to the old mode of war fare, was thrust close up to the walls of a besieged castle or city, and served to protect from the arrows and stones of the besieged a party of soldiers placed within the sow, who, being thus defended, were in the meanwhile employed in undermining the wall, or breaking an entrance through it with pickaxes and mining tools. When the Countess of March saw this engine advanced to the walls of the castle, she called out to the But Dunbar is a town of ancient lineage and long history; and as we stand upon its rugged sea-board, or wander about the ruins of its grim old"], [106, "90 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. plies by sea both of men and provisions. The Earl of Salisbury, learning this, de spaired of success, and raised the siege, which had lasted nineteen weeks. The minstrels made songs in praise of the perseverance and courage of Black Agnes. The following lines are nearly the sense of what is preserved: Earl of Salisbury in derision and making a kind of rhyme, \u2014 \"Beware, Montagow, For farrow shall thy sow.\" At the same time she made a signal, and a huge fragment of rock, which hung prepared for the purpose, was dropped down from the wall upon the sow, whose roof was thus dashed to pieces. As the English soldiers, who had been within it, were running as fast as they could to get out of the way of the arrows and stones which were dis charged on them from the wall, Black Agnes called out, ' Behold the litter of English pigs! ' ' She kept a stir in tower and trenchs That brawling boisterous Scottish wench ; Came I early, came I late, I found Agnes at the gate.' \"* But chief among all the incidents in the history of Dunbar was the battle fought there by Oliver Cromwell, on the 3rd of September, 1650: when \"Lesley's force of three-and-twenty thousand,\" and Oliver's of \"about half as many\" stood face to face. The battle was destined, as both sides doubtless felt, to be decisive of great things, of more than Oliver's supremacy, of Scotland's re lation to her sister kingdom and nothing less. Lesley's army had placed itself on Doon Hill, one of the lower heights of the Lammermoors, close by the town ; a strong vantage-ground, from w7hich, if he had kept it, probably victory might have been won. Cromwell and his army were encamped below by the town itself, and no wonder that they trembled for the issue. On the eve ofthe battle he wrote from this to Sir Arthur Haselrig: \u2014 The Earl of Salisbury could jest also on such serious occasions. One day he rode near the walls with a knight dressed in armour of proof, having three folds of mail over an acton or leathern jacket ; notwithstanding which, one William Spens shot an arrow from the battle ments of the castle with such force, that it penetrated all these defences, and reached the heart of the wearer. 'That is one of my lady's love-tokens,' said the earl, as he saw the knight fall dead from his horse. 'Black Agnes' s love shafts pierce to the heart.' Upon another occasion, the Countess of March had wellnigh made the Earl of Salisbury her prisoner. She caused one of her people to enter into treaty with the besiegers, pretending to betray the castle. Trusting to this agreement, the earl came at midnight before the gate, which he found open, and the portcullis drawn up. As Salisbury was about to enter, one John Copland, a squire of Northumberland, pressed on before him, and as soon as he passed the threshold, the portcullis was dropped, and thus the Scots missed their principal prey, and made prisoner only a person of inferior condition. \"Weare upon an engagement very difficult. The enemy hath blocked up our way at the Pass at Copperspath [Cockburnspath,] through which we cannot get without almost a miracle.

And all through there is \u2014 in the battle and in the rout \u2014 a very sincere sense, whether mistaken or not, that God is fighting for the victorious host. So does Oliver call upon the portion of the army which is about him, to halt a moment as they come to the foot of Doon Hill \u2014 that same Doon Hill to which he and his council of war had looked with such apprehen sions but an hour or two before, there to sing their Puritan Te Deum, \u2014 In the night Lesley's force descended to the plain, upon what motive of policy it has never been possible to see ; per haps, think some, because they thought their enemy had been committed into their hand, and that they had nothing to do but descend and claim their prey. Cromwell and his two associates, Lambert and Monk', watched the pro cess of descent with interested eye, and dying hope began to live again. They saw that if they began the onset, and attacked the right wing, which was thoroughly exposed, they would have an obvious advantage, for the body of the army was certain to find itself awkwardly placed with the hill which they had left behind them and a stream as it happened in front, and would be able to render little help to the attacked wing. And the night was not gone O give ye praise unto the Lord, All nations that be ; Likewise ye people all accord His name to magnify. For great to usward ever are His lovingkindnesses ; His truth endures for evermore, The Lord O do ye bless ! We need not pursue the battle story further : it is victory all along the line. Let us cull a few sentences from Car lyle. It is Cromwell's own account in his letter to Speaker Lenthall : \u2014 before their scheme was put in trial. It was but a short and sharp passage of arms, and ere the sun had arisen, the astonished Scottish host was beaten while their \" matches [as Carlyle puts it] were hardly well alight.\" \"The enemy's word was, The Covenant, which it had been for divers days. Ours, The Lord of Hosts. The Major-General, Lieutenant - General Fleetwood, and Commissary - General Whalley, and Colonel Twistleton, gave the onset; the enemy being in a very good position to receive them, having the advantage of their cannon and foot against our horse. Before our foot could come up, the enemy made a gallant resistance, and there was a very hot dispute at swords' point between our horse and theirs. Our first foot, after they had discharged their duty . . . received some repulse, which they soon recovered. For my own regiment, under the com mand of Lieutenant-Colonel Goffe and my major, White, did come seasonably in ; and at the push of pike, did repel the stout regiment the enemy had there, merely with the courage the Lord was pleased to give, which proved a greaf\".

Even now, as we read that story in Carlyle's marvellous narrative, the whole seems to be enacted before our very eyes. The Scotch are rushing about in dismay, aye, in despair; to Belhaven, Dunbar, Haddington, any where to be out of reach of this terrible Protector and his Ironsides. Meanwhile these same Ironsides are pursuing,"], [108, "PIC TURE SQ UE SCO TLA ND. 92 hath done for England and His people, this war.\" amazement to the residue of their foot, this being the first action between the foot. The horse in the meantime did, with a great deal of courage and spirit, beat back all opposition, charging through the bodies of the enemy's horse and of their foot; who were, after the first repulse given, made by the Lord of Hosts as stubble to their swords. So may be said, in effect, to have ended the military rivalry of Scotland and England; other risings succeeded. coming- fitfully through the next century. but they were as nought compared wit.* this ; there was no longer any measuring of strength between an undivided Scot land and her sister kingdom; and now these struggles are like half-forgotte:i. dreams, while each kingdom seeks to rival its neighbour only in the gentler arts of peace. The best of the enemy's horse being broken through and through in less than an hour's dispute, their whole army being put into confusion, it became a total rout; our men having the chase and execution of them near eight miles. We believe that upon the place and near about it, were about three thousand slain. Prisoners taken; of their officers you have this enclosed list ; of private soldiers near ten thousand Thus it is but fit that Dunbar herself should take to gentler ways, and be known for more peaceful occupations; but grudge her not the place she owns. as having been once the field on which was fought out, for better, for worse, the strife which was to settle for all coming time the endless and fruitless struggle for mastery which hindered civilisation, and made all peace but as a truce oa either side the Tweed. We are confident they have left behind them not less than fifteen thousand men. Thus you have the prospect of one of the most signal mercies God Tn the Lammermoors, EADER, have you ever free air, go to the Lammermoors some time for a summer's holiday. You will perchance find a lodging in some farm house, or in a chance cottage more likely, for farmers there are proud folk, and keep their big houses to themselves ; and you will get good meat, good milk, good air, and sine scenery. For miles and miles the hills stretch unbroken ; and one's only regret- and that perhaps a foolish one \u2014 is that the farmers are so enterprising. The hills are now too often likegreat masses of patch work; they are divided out into fields, and in many cases the plough has gone almost to their summits.

No. And so you rush past in the train, glad if you are so fortunate as to get one which does not stop at Grant's House \u2014 the most convenient station \u2014 but rushes on from Berwick to Dunbar without a break.

You must go to Abbey St. Bathan's \u2014 \"the Aebrhey\" as the good folk thereabout call it \u2014 and see the nun nery of St. Bathan, founded by a Countess of March in the 12th century; and meditate on the far-sightedness of the Roman Church which placed its monasteries and its nunneries in the midst of fair landscapes, as at Melrose, at Dryburgh, at Jedburgh, and here.

And nature spoke to the finer souls among them, and made them chant their psalms at prime and vespers with a deeper meaning; only think of their singing the io_|th Psalm upon those heights, when the green turf was undisturbed by coulter, and when many a wild beast no doubt made its home in its solitary places. And if you are inclined to wander sea wards, make your way down to Fast Castle, of which we have spoken, stand ing now a wild and sad ruin upon its sea-washed rock \u2014 the \"Wolf's Crag,\" it is said, of the \"Bride of Lammermoor.\" We remember wrell a sight we had of it now some years ago After driving from the pleasant little village of Ayton through the old town of Coldingham, we drew up at a farmhouse a mile or two on this side of the castle, and standing at the head of a cliff which was 400 feet above the sea. It was a glorious sum mer's evening, and after resting a little while we made up a company and went down the cliff by a path which for safety's sake had been made like so many Z's, and which lengthened out the 400 feet to three-quarters of a mile. We had some fishing-gear with us, and \" launching \" the good farmer's boat we went out a little bit to sea, casting our lines and glorying in the scene. The sun was just then at its setting, and the sea was calm, the waves rippling rather than surging : everything about us was. still, save for the moving of our lines, and the gentle leaping up into the air of the porpoises, taking in a new stock of breath. What a wondrous mirroring of the \"sun's remove\" upon the face of the deep! first the golden brightness dazzling our eyes, as it made the waters not sparkle, but shine; then the gentler yellow; then the \"fiery glow\" which might w7ell make one think of the \" sea of glass, mingled with fire;\" then the darkening gloamin', weird and sad. And yonder in the distance stood out in clear relief this same old Fast Castle, a ruin speaking to us of suns that had set long ago, and of the many bright human lives which here had darkened down into night. It was a lesson of the abiding and the passing in this mysterious universe; the changing but continuing ocean, more lasting even than the \"eternal hills; \" the lone and desolate castle, a habitation now only for the sea- He sendeth the springs into the valleys, Which run among the hills.

He had been desperately hoping that somehow the marriage would fall through; when all his hopes were rudely shattered one evening while he was feasting a com pany in his house at Hilton, by a plain farmer remarking that \"After a', Lord Avondale w7as to be buckled to the fair rose of Roecleuch.\" which bears the name of Lammer- moor, as we have seen already, has naturally attracted the pen of the novelist; but the \"Bride of Lammermoor\" is only one of the legends which it has furnished to romance. We are now to give the reader another which has been set forth with much tragic skill, concerning another \"bride of Lammermoor,\" Madeline of Roecleuch. The story gathers around the ruins of Roecleuch Castle, which has been described as \" an ancient baronial pile, perched, in spectral gloom, upon the rugged margin of one of those dark ravines by which that wild district is here and there intersected.\" \"Johnston,\" says the annalist, \"heard these sayings of his visitor, as will readily be supposed, with feelings of no very pleasing description, but struggled hard to suppress any outward demonstration of his mental emotion. Immediately seizing a bottle which stood before him upon the table, he replenished his glass to the rim, and as quickly swallowed its contents, apparently with the view of drowning the galling sensations with which wounded pride and enmity had filled his breast. The departure of his visitors, which did not take place till a very late, or rather early hour, imparted no alleviation to his distracted feelings. Wild and sleepless, he paced backward and forward in his chamber ; at intervals, vainly attempting to allay the agony of his spirit by renewed applications to the wine-flask. But such means, he, like many before and after him, found inade quate to In the end of the seventeenth century this mansion was occupied by Sir George Sinclair and his only daughter, Madeline, a young lady of great beauty and accom plishments.

One visitor, however, came pretty frequently to the castle \u2014 Lord Avondale, a near relative; as boy and girl they \u2014 Madeline and he \u2014 were play mates, and during his annual visits many a happy day was spent by them roaming \"about the braes,\" or wandering by the brook's side.

In a state of madness, he resolved to seek there for his mental sufferings, a mitigation which he had sought for in vain within the walls of his own dwelling. Accord ingly, wrapping his cloak around him, he hastened thither, and 'seated himself in a pew immediately in front of the pulpit. The appearance of his features, agitated by his internal emotions, as well as by the means w'hich he had resorted to for quelling them, exhibited a striking contrast to the calm and serene expres sion of face borne by the rustics who sat around him contented and happy. ruption. The rustic audience did not. however, so speedily recover from their surprise, but in silent wonderment con tinued to gaze upon the laird. ' There be,' said the preacher, com mencing his discourse, 'divers classes of individuals unto whom the words which I have just now read unto you from the holy book are addressed. Some be there, who, overwhelmed with the cares and sorrows of this transitory scene, and finding here below no place of refuge from the fury of the tempest that has gathered around them, in the spirit of meekness and of humility, come unto Him who is both able and willing to rescue them ; others be there, who, thwarted in their vain schemes of ambi tion or of pelf, with the leaven of passion or of pride still rankling in their breasts, impiously resort to Him for succour.' At length an aged and venerable man stalked up the aisle, entered the pulpit, and gave out the psalm. He was Daniel Douglas, who, with Sir Patrick Hume, the celebrated knight of Polvvarth, had been obliged to abdicate his charge and seek refuge for some years in Holland, during the evil days of the persecution; but whom the more tranquil period sub sequent to the Revolution had reinstated in the pastoral charge of the parish of Hilton. He was a staunch and unbend ing advocate of the rules and doctrines of the Reformed religion, which he had boldly asserted and defended, when to have done so was considered a crime. Scarcely had these words passed from the lips of the speaker, before the door of the pew in which Johnston was seated, was flung violently open, and its occu pant, darting across the passage, flew up the pulpit stair, grasped the preacher by the throat, and, in another moment, dashed his head with such violence against the desk as caused the blood to flow forth in a copious stream from his nostrils. At this juncture, the whole congregation rose hurriedly from their seats, and several individuals sprang forward to\" rescue their minister from the hands of his infuriated assailant. The latter was no sooner secured, than Daniel Douglas, composedly wiping away with his napkin the blood with which his mouth was besmeared, turned towards Johnston, and, in an emphatic tone, exclaimed aloud.: \u2014 The psalm sung and the prayer ended, ' Come unto me, all ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,' was the text announced by the venerable parson. 'You lie,' exclaimed his abandoned patron, at the same time rising from his seat; but almost imme diately reassuming it \u2014 ' You can give no rest \u2014 no rest.' For a moment the divine lifted his eyes from the page of the sacred volume which was spread out before him, and directed them toward the individual who had so indecorously interrupted him; but almost instantly he repeated in a yet louder and more emphatic tone, the words which had given rise to the inter- 'Unhappy man! unto this holy sanc tuary which thou hast now irreverently profaned, shall thy mangled carcass be brought, not many days hence ; yea, the very dogs shall lap thy heart's blood from the floor.' Next day Hilton was wending his way up the Lammermoors. He entered and"], [113, "A TALE OF THE LAMMERMOORS. 97 passed through a long, deep defile, at the bottom of which \"flowed a small brook, here and there impeded, in its onward course, by huge and ungainly masses of rock, which, in the lapse of years, had been hurled down from the lofty cliffs by which it was overhung. At last, the baron paused, and, looking upward to one of those craggy steeps, the summit of which was clothed with the dense foliage of the stunted birch and dwarf oak, he drew forth from beneath his cloak a small bugle-horn, and made the wide echoes of the glen respond to its wild music. Three times had the blast been repeated, when the figure of a man appeared, crouching behind the foliage at the top of the cliff, reconnoitring the individual who had intruded himself so near his solitary abode. Apparently satisfied with the result of his scrutiny, he stood up erect, and displayed a tall athletic figure, which at the place from which it was viewed by the other, corresponded exactly with the ordinary description of a giant. He was attired in a tight, close, party coloured dress, formed of the skins of hares, and the other furry tenants of the bleak region in which he lived ; and the rays of the morning sun, which had now begun to peep forth above the hills, were reflected from the clear hilt of a dagger, stuck in a belt that surrounded his waist. He beckoned the baron to approach towards the base of the cliff, and com menced lowering down a strong rope or cable, to the end of which was suspended a swing seat. Hilton having seated himself in it, was quickly raised, by means of a revolving lever, to the ledge of rock that protruded at the feet of the robber\u2014 for such was the calling of the individual whom he had gone to visit. His countenance bore an expression of haughtiness that indicated the utter con tempt in which he held the laws and their administrators. During several years of the earlier part of his life, he had served as a private soldier in the persecuting ranks of the bloody Claver house, whom he had beheld expire in the arms of victory at the Pass of Killie crankie. After the annihilation of the Stuart dynasty, he had abandoned the profession of a soldier, though we cannot add that he had also laid aside that of arms. Retiring to this wild region of the Lammermoors, he had sought out for himself a suitable lurking place, whence he occasionally sallied forth and levied unwilling contributions from the lairds and farmers of the Merse.\" \" Rob o' the Muirs \" this terrible man was generally called, and many were the stories of depredation which were afloat regarding him. He had at one time been brought up at Jedburgh on a charge of highway robbery, and had been acquitted mainly through the offices of the Laird of Hilton, who thus felt that \"Rob\" owed him some obligation. The laird having been hoisted to the mouth of Rob's cave, made his entrance under the guidance of the latter. The place was full enough of swords, pistols, and other weapons to look more like an armoury than aught else ; with such companions it was that Rob chose to dwell. As soon as they had entered, he offered the laird a repast \u2014 cold, as he explained, since it would not be conve nient that smoke should issue from his cave now that the sun was up. Johnston, however, would only refresh himself with a quegh [cup] or two of Rob's \" mountain dew\" \u2014 i.e., whisky \u2014 and to this accom paniment he discussed dark plans \u2014 fit for such a cavern \u2014 with Rob. Mentioning that the wedding was to take place in a few days, he got his freebooting friend to promise that he would carry Madeline off and shut her up, until she should con sent to become the Laird of Hilton's wife. \"A bargain be it, then,\" were the closing words to the agreement ;\" hold yourself in readiness waiting for me on that day, about nightfall, among the ruins of the old nunnery of St. Bathan's;"], [114, "JEDBURGH ABBEY \u2014 THE NAVE.

Hilton then dismounted, and consigning Made line to the care of the freebooter, plunged on, as best he could, in a direction in which the latter assured him he would find a shepherd's hut, where he might take refuge for the night. Scrambling forward with great difficulty to the sum mit of an eminence, he at length descried a light proceeding from the small win dow, or bole of the mud-built cot; in the interior of which the guidman and his w7ife were seated by the side of a blazing fire of peats. Here the husband, Robin, and the wife, Eppy, were having a com fortable fire-side ' crack,' when, all of a sudden, a loud knocking was heard at the door, and Robin, rising from his seat, and seizing a piece of rudely-shaped wood, which served as an apology for a candlestick, proceeded towards the door, to ascertain the cause of the disturbance. After some questions put, and apparently satisfactorily answered from without, Robin undid the latch of the door, and the Baron of Hilton entered. With some scruples, Robin was induced to put on his big coat, and accompany the latter with his lighted lanthorn to the spot where he had left the lady and the free booter, to assist them in disengaging their horses from the drift. With con siderable difficulty, this was accomplished, and the latter led into Robin's cow byre, and Madeline, in a state of utter insensi bility, deposited in a chair by the side of the fire. 'Lord hae mercy on us! what's ailin' the puir lassie?' exclaimed Eppy, holding the candle^ and gazing on the pallid features of Madeline of Roe cleugh.\" Meantime, preparations were going on for Madeline's marriage of a happier kind ; and at length the day arrived. It was in the month of November, and snow was lying deep upon the ground ; but the morning ofthe bridal day dawned bright and clear, and nature seemed to smile upon the happy pair, and her snow-white garment was as a bridal dress. The marriage, according to old Scot tish custom, was to take place in the -evening, and punctually at the hour of six the priest stood forth to celebrate it. But, alas, \"the hour was come, but not the \" maid, and frantic search was made for her all through the house in vain. For, just at the \"dark'nin',\" Rob had \u25a0come muffled in a heavy cloak, and, \u2022climbing by a ladder to the window of her apartment, carried her off unseen. Terror had made poor Madeline insen sible, and so no cry had escaped her to warn her friends. And, before they \u25a0discovered that she had gone, Rob was well on his way to Abbey St. Bathan's, where Hilton was to meet him. At the \" trysted \" spot these two met, Hilton, dark, eager, expectant: Rob, rough and fierce-looking, \u2014 yet somehow the better looking man of the two, with the fair and still unconscious Madeline before him. Hilton threw a purse to Rob, and received from him at the same lime his precious charge. \"A distant halloo now broke upon their ears. Hilton lifted the lady in his arms, and both hurried to the place where their horses were fastened; and in a few moments they were galloping over the moor, as fast as the snow would allow, in a direction opposite to that whence the sound seemed to proceed. Thus they had travelled for a considerable distance, when the horses became unable The good woman was easily satisfied by being told that it was a rough night, and that the delicate young, lady had been overcome with cold and fatigue. Scarce had these matters been explained, and the company so far settled down, however, when once more a noise was heard at the door. The wedding guests had got upon Rob and Hilton's track,"], [116, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 100 and five or six of his opponents stationed as a guard upon him for the night.\" While he was lying in agony, some one said to him, \" I fear thou hast done for them.\" \" Then I shall die content,\" said Hilton. It was something to die with the thought that his wicked purpose had so far succeeded as that Madeline and Avondale should not live to be husband and wife. His dying hope was false, however, as the reader will rejoice to find. Sir George Sinclair carried his beloved Madeline to his home, and tended her with alia father's love and care. probably guided by footprints in the snow; and now they were shouting at the cottage-door for admittance. The guidman of the house was hesitating whether to open it, when Rob \" hinted to him, by a significant glance at his firelock,\" that he should suffer the instant he did so. Still louder was now the shouting and the knocking, but no answer was returned ; then the outside company \u2022contrived to burst open the door, and two men ran into the cottage; but the first received a bullet in his shoulder from Rob's carabine. \"A desperate struggle ensued, which lasted for some minutes, and promised to have turned out favourably for Hilton and his coad jutor, when a reinforcement on the part of Lord Avondale \u2014 for he it was who had first rushed into the house, and received the bullet of the robber in his shoulder \u2014 entirely changed the aspect of affairs. Rob, after discharging his carabine, had continued for some time to employ the butt end of it with consider able success, and had once more raised it with the intention of bringing it into vehement contact with the cranium of one of his now numerous assailants, when a successful slash from the cutlass of another, sent his weapon, and the hand that wielded it, in social company to the ground. The two rival suitors, in the meantime, had not been inactive, when a shot from one of the party stretched Johnston upon the floor. The serious privation which the robber had met with in the loss of his hand, had not so effec tually dispirited him as to have prevented him from inflicting, with a stool which he snatched from the floor with his re maining member, considerable molesta tion on the persons of those who, at this \u25a0crisis, rushed forward to secure him. His efforts at resistance, as might have been expected, were unable to withstand, for any length of time, the superiornumerical force of his antagonists. He was at length overpowered, and being firmly bound, he was dragged to the cow-house, As to the laird, who died, as we have seen, in such an unholy mood, as soon as his people heard of his death, they came and bore away his body from Robin and Eppy's cottage. And then the story tells how the old minister's prediction regarding him was fulfilled: \u2014 \"When they had reached within a few miles of the mansion-house, a heavy snow-fall, which had continued for some time, rendered the roads, previously bad enough, almost impassable. Attaching a rope to the end of the litter, and each taking hold of it, the men had continued to plunge forward, dragging the corpse over the surface of the snow till they reached the wall of Hilton churchyard. In a state of exhaustion, they resolved to deposit their burden within the church all night, as they felt too wearied to allow of their proceeding onward to the house, which stood about half a mile to the eastward. They accordingly raised the body from the bier and deposited it in the same pew of the church which its wretched owner had occupied and pro fanely violated on the Sunday of the preceding week. As they did so, the bandage slipped from off the wound, and a large mass of coagulated blood fell upon the floor, which was immedi ately seized and gobbled up by the hungry hounds that had been following at their master's heels : and thus were the prophetic words of Douglas verified.\""], [117, "A TALE OF THE LAMMERMOORS. 101 Avondale \u2014 he it was who had got the bullet in his shoulder from Rob's cara bine\u2014though sorely wounded, made his way to Avondale Castle, where he was stricken down with fever, and long raved in delirium, dreaming much, no doubt, of Madeline.

This proposal met with the most cordial acquiescence from Sandy, who manifested his joy by a multitude of uncouth gestures and shrugs of his shoulders. Perhaps it might be con sidered tedious were we to describe the adventures which the idiot encountered on his journey ; suffice it for us to say, that, on the evening of the second day from his departure, he succeeded in making his way into the presence of Sir George Sinclair, not without encounter ing great opposition from the servants, to whom he had doggedly refused to explain whence he had come, or what was the object of his visit. Having de livered the packet, he was remunerated in a manner much more ample than he had looked forward to, even as a reward for rehearsing the tragical events of the exe cution, which he did, till, at length, grow ing troub!esome,Sir George rang the bell and ordered a servant to conduct him from the apartment. As the door was rudely slammed behind him, Sandy thrust his hands into his pockets, and muttered to himself \u2014 ' I ay took the Laird of Roe cleugh to hae been a man o' mair manners than to hae used ane sae badly that had come sae far to see him.

So in he went, and a very merry night was being spent. However, Mr. A. thought it was necessary to say some thing by way of forestalling any re minder from \"the minister\" as to his absence from the kirk on the past Sabbath-day ; and so, turning to him, he said, \"Oh, Mr. C, ye'll maybe re member that I wasna at the kirk o' Sab bath-day ; but the sac' is I wasna weel, as the bairns nae doubt telled ye.\" \"I re member, Mr. A., that that was the reason of your absence.\" \" Yes,\" said Mr. A., \"and so it was; but I didna spend the forenoon sae badly for a' that.

It is only upon Sunday, when roads and lanes are busy with people on their way to church or home again (for most people there do go to church); or perhaps at an election time, when for the while political issues have roused all to enthusiasm, that there is much appearance of bustle.

And so we read in the old fashioned poem of Barbour, how Syme of Spalding, a Berwick burgess, having been offended by the governor of the town, sent a letter to the Earl of Dunbar, showing how the king, Robert the Bruce, might proceed in the taking of Berwick. Bruce commanded the Earl to gather his men at \" Duns-park,\" where he arranged that Randolph and Douglas should meet him. And the gathering is thus described in Barbour's quaint lines : \u2014 - But men of far other stamp than this, be sure, have had their home in the Merse. Good Ralph Erskine, one ofthe leaders of a great secession from the church of Scotland in the last century, w7as the son of the holy Henry Erskine, minister of the parish of Chirnside ; and we used to hear long ago how that he was wont to wander by the bonnie green haughs of the Whitadder below the little village of Allanton, and dream into being his once famous \"Gospel Sonnets.\" In the same parish, in a quiet little mansion which has been associated with the name of Hume for many a generation, often dwelt David Hume the historian, of whom we have had some thing to say already. And some loyal son of Berwickshire will perhaps tell you \u2014 and let us hope he may be right\u2014 that one of the greatest schoolmen of the Middle Ages, John Duns Scotus, sprung from the neighbourhood of the little town of Dunse. \"Than ofthe best of Lothiane He him till his tryst has ta'ne ; For schyreiff thereof then was he : To Dans-park than with his menye He came at evyn privelige.\" And not to mention other times in his tory when Dunse heard the clang of armour, or, at least, saw the ranks of soldiers set in array, we must remind our readers ofthe fact that during the earlier period of the Scotch rising against Charles I., Dunse Law \u2014 the hill beside the town \u2014 was chosen as a place of encampment. Says Chalmers: \u2014 \"The Scotish leaders encamped their bands at Duns, where armies had assembled of old, under very different auspices. And the borderers are said to have exulted when they saw their native hills again traversed by hostile spears ; as they delighted in the tumults of war, and hoped for the plunder of both sides.\" The Scotch people, wearied of the king's persistent attempts to Anglicize them and their Church, had begun to think that nothing but the sword would settle their difficulties. King Charles, too, was appealing to the issues of war ; and, as he approached the southern side of the border, they took up their position on its northern side. Cromwell's bio grapher thus tersely describes the posi tion : \u2014 The mention of Dunse, however, re minds us that the lands of the Merse, peaceful though they seem to-day, have not always been so : and this little town itself has witnessed in days gone by many a w7arlike scene, and has been for the time a military centre. For Dunse is an ancient town; and as it lies there now so quietly at the head of the plain of the Merse, and backed and flanked by the Lammermoors, we look at it and dream of the days when there dwelt here no less a personage than the royal Randolph, Earl of Moray. Its nearness to Berwick, which standing as it did on the border-line was ever a bone of con tention between England and Scotland, made it a convenient spot, perhaps alike \" His majesty got an army ready7. marched with it to Berwick, \u2014 is at New- E"], [122, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 106 castle, Sth May, 1639.

And from that day to this the quietude of the rural town has been but little disturbed, and now, in the midst of its unpretending peacefulness, there is scarce aught to make one think of those doughtier days when it in some way earned for itself the proverb \"Dunse dings a'.\" And Cooke, the Scotch church historian, tells how that \"the most popular ministers in military array, though exempted from all duty inconsistent with their profes sion, frequented the camp; sermons, calculated to animate and inflame, were regularly delivered; prayers w7ere offered to God for what was styled\" [so he un- Py the Tweed \u2014 Berwick. f;r~5^giaE pass now from il &\\k?i t'ie r'c*1 P'ains of gl ;K~v the Merse to wan- y$$J. der by the plea- g?SSl \u00ab sant* banks of the s$*l# Tweed, to trace its silvery line, .nd as we wander upwards o tarry awhile and look at ome of those spots famous n history which, through the .vritings of Sir Walter Scott and otherwise, have names fountain-headinPeebleshire,\" among the silent hills,\" it is through all its course a gentle and quiet-flowing stream, with nothing of the majesty and grandeur of the Tay, but with a quiet beauty all its own.

But a word or two first concerning the river Tweed itself. The river is supposed to have got its name from an old British word Tucdd, which means \"on the border of a country,\" and thus it seems to have had settled for it at a very early date the place it was destined to take as the frontier-line between separate kingdoms.

This latter wall was reared by Edward I., and surrounded the part now occupied by the little \"suburbs\" of Castle-gate and \" the Greens,\" or \" Greenses,\" as they are locally called. Of other antiquities in Berwick besides the walls, the chief is the ancient castle, which has been significantly in ruin since about 1603, when the kingdoms of Eng land and Scotland happily became united, and when, therefore, the \" occu pation \" of Berwick's strong old castle, and of Berwick itself as a military posi tion, was indeed gone. Beginning with its mouth, we must first of all speak of Berwick, a town which, though not now Scotch, had the honour once of being reckoned to Scot- land, and which has had much to do with the varying fortunes of Scotch and English arms. Berwick, which is about 300 miles from London, and 47 from Edinburgh, is built upon the top and side of a slight hill which rises by the northern side of Tweed. It is still, as everybody knows, in the possession of walls, and is now one of the very few walled towns in our island. Its ram- parts were reared in the days of \"good Queen Bess,\" and on the north and east sides are made of earth and stone; whilst at intervals along the line of them are \"bastions\" with \"cavaliers,\" and a dry ditch extends alongside of them to the river. The ramparts have five gates, and have been kept in good condition; although for the last sixty years the comparative absence of guns from the fort may well be said to mark the fact that they are kept in existence mainly as a noble and striking memorial of war- like days that are long gone by. And, indeed, in this regard they are not use- less, for no imaginative soul can walk along them without feeling that he is somehow united with the shades of the departed, and without in imagination seeing outside the eager ranks of some besieging army, within the grimly earnest faces of the besieged, evidently determined to starve and even to die rather than to yield. These walls now measure about a mile-and-a-half in cir- The town-hall of Berwick is a very handsome building for a small town, and is surmounted by a spire 150 feet in height, and the parish church, dating from the time of Cromwell, is worthy of a passing mention. Just opposite to the parish church stands the beautiful Wallace Green Church, belonging to the Presbyterian Church of England ; and hereby hangs a good tale. It is said that upon some public occasion, perhaps some thirty years ago, the then vicar declared that there was only one church in Berwick. An excellent gentle man, a stranger to the town, hearing of this, thought to himself, \"What! here is a town with ten to twelve thousand in habitants, and only one church! Can I do better than devote a sum which I had laid aside for the building of a church in a destitute locality to the erection ofa second church here?\" He acted upon his re solution, and a newchurch, in connection with the Church of England, was built. Coming to Berwick some time after wards, and being with the vicar at the parish church, he saw a handsome build ing close by. \"Why,\" said he, \"you have surely built my church very near to your own.\" \" Oh, but that is not your church,\" said the vicar. \" I thought,\" was the rejoinder, \" that yours was the only church in Berwick, until mine was built?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said the church's Im'-'"], [124, "108 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. siege which will give the reader a picture ofthe place and the time. vicar; \"mine was the only church, but there are a dozen chapels.\" It may be said that the minister of this Presby terian church which the worthy vicar had ignored as not worth mentioning, was the Rev. Dr. Cairns, now Principal of a Theological College in Edinburgh, and one of the most gifted preachers and ablest philosophers at present living in Scotland. Edward purposed, upon his victorious return south, to strengthen this already strong town ; but his intention was for a time defeated. The victorious English met with a reverse at Stirling Bridge; and the reinvigorated Scots immediately gained back the lost town ; it was so only, however, for a brief space, for Edward had only to reappear upon the scene in person to secure the restora tion of the place to his possession. The town of Berwick has a very ancient history, its beginning, indeed, being lost in an obscure past. Its char ter was confirmed by several sovereigns from the time of Edward I. ; but it is supposed that it first attained to some position as a town when Scot and Saxon struggled together for the possession of the south-eastern district of Scotland ; its position made it a natural meeting-point for contending armies, and he who held Berwick might be said to be master of his surroundings. So far back as the time of Alexander I. of Scotland, it took rank with Edinburgh, Roxburgh, and Stirling, as a royal burgh; and those who know only the little market-town of to-day can scarcely realise its proud position and prestige in those early times. A proud position, however, is neither gained nor kept without trouble; and Berwick had to pay very dearly, in often finding itself the theatre of strife and tumult, for its ancient importance. Here in 1292 \u2014 at the old castle \u2014 Ed ward I. gave his decision in favour of Balliol as rightful claimant to the Scot tish crown. Hither in 1296 Edward I. returned again, and, on his way north to overthrow Balliol, who had turned against him, he made an onset upon the border town. The taking of Berwick upon this occasion is a story of pitilessly secured victory; and we shall in a -succeeding article quote a legend of the Our readers will remember how, in barbarous triumph over the dead Wal lace, the English ordered the quarters of his body to be exhibited in various places as a token of victory and of warning ; and Berwick was one of the places so dishonoured and insulted. Nor is it a more pleasing reminiscence of those warlike times, or one more fitted to raise our estimate of the glory of war, that \"the Countess of Buchan of that day, because of the hereditary right which her house claimed of taking part in the coronation of the Scottish kings, was hung in a cage from one of the towers of the castle.\" People who talk raptur ously of \"good old times,\" would spend a profitable hour in meditating upon some of these things i i With the union of the kingdoms the military importance of Berwick began to decline, and it has long ago ceased to hold any importance save as a market town fortheprosperous farmers around,as possessing a good harbour, and as being an important centre of the fishing trade. As one passes through it to-day, one can hardly realise the time when it was a little kingdom by itself, with its own lord-chancellor and lord-chamberlain, a governor, and a \" Domesday Book.\" \" So passes the glory of the world.\""], [125, "THE STORY OF RED HALL. 109 The Story \u25a0Red Wall.

Amongst the merchants of the Red Hall, was one known by the appellation of William the Fleming, and he had a daughter, an heiress and only child, whose beauty was the theme of Berwick's minstrels, when rhyme was beginning to begin. Many a knee was bent to the rich and beautiful Isabella ; but she preferred the humble and half-told passion of Francis Scott, who was one of the clerks in the Red Hall, to all the chivalrous declara tions of prouder lovers. Francis pos sessed industry and perseverance; and these, in the eyes of her father, were qualifications precious as rubies. These, with love for his daughter, overcame other mercenary objections, and the day for their marriage had arrived. Francis and Isabella were kneeling before the altar, and the priest was pronouncing the service \u2014 the merchant was gazing fondly over his child \u2014 when a sudden and a hurried peal from the Bell Tower broke upon the ceremony \u2014 and cries of ' The English ! to arms ! ' were heard from the street. The voice of the priest faltered \u2014 he stopped \u2014 William the Fleming placed his hand upon his sword \u2014 the bridegroom started to his feet, and the fair Isabella clung to his side. ' Come, children,' said the merchant, ' let us to the Hall \u2014 a happier hour may bless your nuptials \u2014 this is no moment for bridal ceremony.' And in silence, each man grasping his sword, they de- parted from the chapel, where the per- formance of the marriage rites was than five hundred years ago, and Ber- wick-upon-Tweed was the most wealthy and flourishing city in Great Britain. Its com merce was the most ex- tensive, its merchants the most enterprising and successful. London in some measure strove to be its rival, but it possessed not a tenth of the natural advantages, and Berwick continued to bear the palm alone \u2014 being styled the Alexandria of the nations, the emporium of commerce, \u2022 and one of the first commercial cities of the world. This state of prosperity it owed almost solely to Alexander III., who did more for Berwick than any sovereign that has since claimed its allegiance. He brought over a colony of wealthy Flemings, for whom he erected an immense building, called the Red Hall (situated where the Wool market now stands), and which at once served as dwelling-houses, factories, and a fortress. The terms upon which he granted a charter to this company of merchants, were, that they should defend, even unto death, their Red Hall against every attack of an enemy, and of the English in particular. Wool was the staple commodity of their commerce ; but they also traded extensively in silks and in foreign manufactures. The people of Berwick understood Free Trade in those days. In this state of peace and enviable prosperity, it con tinued until the spring of 1296. The bold, the crafty, and revengeful Edward I. meditated an invasion of Scotland; and Berwick, from its wealth, situation, and importance, was naturally antici pated to be the first object of his attack."], [126, "110 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. broken by the sounds of invasion. The ramparts were crowded with armed citizens, and a large English fleet was seen bearing round Lindisfarne. In a few hours the hostile vessels entered the river, and commenced a furious attack upon the town. Their assault was re turned by the inhabitants as men who were resolved to die for liberty. For hours the battle raged, and the Tweed became as a sheet of blood. But, while the conflict rose fiercest, again the Bell Tower sent forth its sounds of death. Edward, at the head of thirty-five thou sand chosen troops, had crossed the river at Coldstream, and was now seen encamping at the foot of Halidon Hill. Part of his army immediately descended upon the town, to the assistance of his fleet. It was the thirty brave Flemings, pouring their arrows upon the trium phant besiegers, and resolved to defend it to death. Amongst them was the father of Isabella, and by his side his intended son-in-law, his hands, which lately held a bride's, dripping with blood. The entire strength ofthe English army pressed around the Hall : and fearful were the doings which the band of de voted merchants, like death' sown marks men, made in the midst of them. What the besiegers, however, failed to effect by force, they effected by fire ; and the Red Hall became enveloped in flames \u2014 its wool, its silks, and rich merchandise blazing together, and causing the fierce element to ascend like a pyramid. Still the brave men stood in the midst of the conflagration, unquailed, hurling death upon her enemies ; and, as the fire raged from room to room, they rushed to the roof of their Hall, discharging their last arrow on their besiegers, and waving their swords around their heads with a shout of triumph. There, also, stood the father, his daughter, and her lover, smiling and embracing each other in death. Crash succeeded crash \u2014 the flames ascended higher and higher \u2014 and the proud building vvas falling to pieces. A louder crash followed, the fierce element surrounded the brave victims \u2014 the gentle Isabella, leaning on her bridegroom, was seen waving her slender hand in triumph round her head \u2014 the hardy band waved their swords and shouted ' Liberty ! ' and, in one moment more, the building fell to the earth, and the heroes, the bride groom, and his bride, were buried in the ruins of their fortress and their factory. Thus fell the Red Hall, and with it the commercial glory of Berwick. Sir William Douglas surrendered the castle to Edward, and the town was given up to plunder and brutality. Its trade in wool and in foreign merchandise was transferred to its rival, London \u2014 and need we say that it has not recovered it ? \"\u2014Wilson's Tales."], [127, "BY THE TWEED TO KELSO. 111 Py the Tweed to Kelso.

We may not stay, however; and so let us \"move on.\" By-and-by we come to Norham Castle, and recall the lines of Scott, in which he pictures the old place as he saw it in imagination amid the scenes of \" Marmion\" : \u2014 \" Day seton Norham's Castle steep, And Tweed's fair river, broad and deep, And Cheviot's mountains lone ; The battled towers, the donjon ke^p, The loophole grates, where captives weep, 'the flanking walls that round it sweep, time, with its engines of steam, to the old, with its echoes of its tremendous engines of war. If the day on which we ascend the river be fine, we shall pro bably see, when we get up a mile or two, some merry little company at one of the \"shiels,\" holding an annual \"kettle.\" \"An 'annual kettle! '\" says our reader; \"what in all the world is that ? \" Well, good friend, we must not stay to tell you all about the origin of this use of the word ; enough to explain that this does not signify a tea-kettle, but a \"kettle of fish.\" A \"kettle,\" indeed, in Berwick parlance, is a pic-nic party, with this specialty about it that fish is the chief thing consumed, and this fish is salmon taken out of the river after the company have gathered, and cooked upon the spot. Very delightful enter tainments are these kettles, and strangers sojourning in the little town in summer time count themselves happy if they can secure an invitation to one of them.

And, speaking of this proximity, it is not a little curious to note the difference in tongue between the Coldstream folk and those of Cornhill, the village across the Leaving these innocent revels behind us, we pass onwards, coming by-and-by to the \" Chain Bridge,\" itself a handsome structure, but chiefly interesting as being suspended over the river at one of the most beautiful points in this part of its course.

The sweet little village which gives to the parish its name, lies not far from Tweedside, on the banks of a small stream called the Eden, and is dear to all Scotsmen and to all lovers of pastoral poetry as the home of James Thomson, the poet of \"The Seasons,\" who was born here in the year 1700. David Macbeth Moir, the \"Delta\" ofthe early Blackwoods, has described the hamlet so well that we give the reader his picture of it: \u2014 Tweed where the railway station is. In Coldstream you will hear the broad, somewhat long-drawn, Berwickshire dia lect, not, indeed, very Scotch in its vocabulary, but very Scotch in accent and pronunciation ; while in Cornhill the whole is changed. The tongue is the tongue of the North of England, and the rolling r-r-r-r of the Berwickshire Scot is replaced by the curious, guttural burr of the Northumbrian. The ford across the Tweed, of little use since the bridge was built, was once of great importance as a passage between England andScotland. Edwards passed into the country by this way in 1296; the Scottish army entered England by crossing the Tweed herein 1640; and Prince Charlie sent a small company across in 1745, in order that they might stand upon English territory and pro claim him king. But the nearness of Coldstream to England, in former times, gave it a character for favouring projects of love as w7ell as war ; and it takes rank along with Gretna Green, Lamberton Toll, and other spots on the Border, as the scene of many \" runaway marriages.\" Chambers tells us in his \" Gazetteer,\" how the landlord of the principal inn used to show, \" with some pride, the room in which Lord Chancellor Brougham submitted to hymeneal bonds.\" To most of us, however, the chief interest of the little town must ever lie in the fact that a few miles south of it lies the battle field of Flodden, A rural church, \u2014 some scattered cottage roofs From whose secluded hearths the thin blue smoke Silently wreathing through the breezeless air Ascends, mingling with the summer sky \u2014 A rustic bridge, mossy and weather-stained \u2014 A fairy streamlet, singing to itself \u2014 And here and there a venerable tree In foliaged beauty : \u2014 of these elements, And only these, the simple scene was formed. But we hasten on to Kelso, sweetest \u2014 we had almost said \u2014 of all sweet towns in the south of Scotland, and with enough alike of picturesque beauty and of antique interest to have claimed a book all to itself. No wonder that the pious monks who neither disregarded fat lands nor fair, should have found here a home; and if, in this, they looked after their own interests, they looked after ours too ; for if they had a noble dwelling, we have instead \u2014 what many of us perhaps prize more \u2014 a magnificent ruin. The monks who held it had first had a settle ment at Selkirk, but Selkirk did not afford quite so many of the good things of the world which they professed to despise, and they besought the king to move them. This was done in 1128, in which year good King David I. founded Kelso Abbey, which he dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. John. \"The edifice,\" says Chambers, \"was con structed in the form of a Greek cross, in a beautiful style of Saxon or early Nor man architecture, with the exception of \" Where shivered was fair Scotland's spear, And broken was her shield ! \" Scotland shudders to think of the story, and there is something in it all so inexpressibly sad that even victorious England says less of it than might be expected.

When the latter was completed, in 1150, no part of Scot land, within so small space, could boast of containing so many splendid religious houses, and it may be supposed that when in full operation the whole of this beautiful district would be a complete halidome, teeming with ecclesiastics, the only learned men of their times, a great part of whom were foreigners ; and that a society would be found of a compara tively refined description.\" milns, breweries, fishings, salt-works, and other possessions ; all which were spread over the several shires of Rox burgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanark, Dum fries, Ayr, Edinburgh, and Berwick, with the church of Culter, as far north as Aberdeenshire.\" Well, indeed, if these excellent men exercised themselves in poverty after this, they knew that they had at least a comfortable reserve fund ; and if they practised fasting, it can scarcely have been for want of food. The abbey has not been without its interest historically, for here w7as buried, 12th June, 1 152, Earl Henry, son and heir of David I., the pious founder; and here, in 1460, immediately upon the death of James II. at the siege of Roxburgh Castle, James III. received the crown. Now of all this great building there remains but the great tower, and the transept, with arches, some of which are said to be grander than any other in Britain, save those of the Minster at York. Well, the brethren who found a shelter in this noble house \u2014 let it be said for them \u2014 were not mere idlers ; they were of the Tyrone order, and were distin guished as practising every sort of handicraft. No man was admitted into their fraternity who had not learned a trade of some sort; and the place was nothing less than a sort of technical college where tradesmen were instructed, and, moreover, a grand co-operative society which did the building, the gar dening, the carpentering, etc., for the whole \" country-side.\" It is well to bear this in mind when we are tempted to be too hard upon the monks of the Middle Ages ; for we must not forget that the maintenance, not only of learning, but also of the arts, in dark times, is thus largely due to them. But here, as every where, ambition did its work, and the nobles whose policy before the Reforma tion seems to have been with kindness to spoil the church, and after the Re formation to \u00c6spoil it, were lavish to the Abbey as usual; and the \"poor\" brethren had, by the end of the 13th century, \"amassed vast property, and extensive privileges.\" \" They held,\" says Chalmers in his \"Caledonia,\" \"themonas tery of Lesmahagow, with its dependen cies, thirty-four parish churches, several manors, many lands, granges, farms, The thoug'ht of Kelso, however, is al ways associated with that of Roxburgh Castle, of which only a stone or two, and these not strictly belonging to the place itself, remain to mark its site. The castle stood upon a slight rising ground at the confluence of Teviot and Tweed, and its foundation dates from a time so ancient that no chronicle tells of its earliest existence. Perhaps it was reared by the Saxons in the days of the Heptarchy as one of the northern strongholds of Northumbria; but of this there is no record. The earliest thing we know of it is that David, Earl of Northumberland, and brother of Alex ander I., dwelt in it, and, on his becom ing king, turned it into a royal palace. From this time it became a place of immense importance. Here, in 1125, the legate of Pope Honorius II. held a council; and in 1 136 the Archbishop of York came to it to seek from King David a truce. At times it was used as a prison, and amongst its annals is re-"], [130, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 114 corded the fact that, in 1306, Mary, Robert Bruce's sister, was confined \"en une Kage,\" within the castle. Chalmers, our unfailing authority, gives the follow ing record of events which took place within its walls : \u2014 black frocks, that the glitter of their armour might not betray them, and desired them cautiously to draw near to the castle, approaching on their hands and knees.\" The ruse succeeded; the sentinels mistook the black objects for cattle, and before the true state of things was realised Douglas's men had scaled the walls and were in possession of the place; but before many years had passed treachery had caused it to change hands again, for in 1334 Edward Balliol made it over (by an \" insidious treaty,\" says Chalmers), with many other strong holds and lands, to the English king. In 1342 Ramsay of Dalhousie regained it for Scotland; but again, 1346, upon the capture of David IL, it reverted to England, and so it remained until 1460 when it was retaken by Mary of Gueldres, immediately after the death of her husband James IL, who died during the siege. To make sure that it should not again become an English strong hold, it was thereupon destroyed. Though partially rebuilt by the Duke of Somerset at the time of his invasion of Scotland (1547), it never regained any importance; and in 1550 it was finally destroyed upon being restored to Scot land by treaty. \"In 1239, on the 15th of May, Alex ander II. married Mary, the daughter of Ingelram de Coucy, at Roxburgh. In 1 24 1, the 4th September, Alexander III. was born at Roxburgh, in the forty fourth year of his father's Lage, and the twenty-seventh of his reign. Alexander III. resided at Roxburgh in September, 12 <;<-,, with Margaret his queen, the daughter of Henry III., whom he mar ried in 125 1 ; and here they were re ceived with great joy, after a grand procession to the church of Kelso. In 1266, Prince Edward, the brother of Margaret, was here magnificently en tertained. In 126S Edward returned to Roxburgh, bringing his brother Edmond with him. The marriage contract of the Princess Margaret with Eric, King of Norway, was settled at Roxburgh. In 1283, the nuptials of Alexander, the Prince of Scotland, with Margaret, the daughter of the Earl of Flanders, was here solemnized. Edward III. twice celebrated his birthday in Roxburgh.\" Like Berwick, Roxburgh shared many vicissitudes of proprietorship and of fortune. William the Lion gave it up to Henry II. as part-price of his freedom ; but 1 1 89 saw it restored to Scotland by the gift of Richard I. King John \"fired\" it in 1216; and in 1292 the Court of King's Bench for England held a ses sion here; while in 1295, Balliol allowed it to be held by Edward I. during the French war. The following year saw it yielded up entirely to Edward, the people then, in a body, yielding homage to him ; and soon after it became the scene of a futile attempt at a siege by Wallace. An interesting tale is told of its being surprised by Douglas in March, 13 12-13. \"Having selected sixty of his most re solute followers, he disguised them with Such was the chequered history of the castle of Roxburgh which now lives only in a few stones which are supposed to mark one of its outer defences, in the title which it gives to a noble family, and in the page of history. In olden times a town or city nestled there under the shadow of the castle, in the little \" inver \" formed by the junction of Teviot and Tweed, but that also is gone, and its memory is chiefly recalled by the ancient St. James's Fair, which, though decreasing in importance, is still held year by year on the grassy haugh where once it stood.

We only pause a moment ere we pass from Kelso to note the fact that its name is associated with that of two ofthe sweetest sacred singers of this century \u2014 Henry Francis Lyte and Horatius Bonar. Lyte, the author of the hymn \"Abide with me! fast falls the eventide,\" so dear to us all, was a native of Kelso or its im mediate neighbourhood; Bonar, whose \" Hymns of Faith and Hope \" are also dear to so many Christian hearts, was minister here for many years.

But the chief interest of Jedburgh to a passing stranger consists in its Abbey, a grand edifice even now7.

It oc cupies a lofty position close by the bank of the river, and from its tower a splendid view is to be obtained, in much resem bling that from Dunion Hill, and taking in a great portion of the Cheviot range. small tributary of the Tweed.

They display all the rude magnificence of the Norman period, used in this instance not experi mentally, as w7as too often the case in England, but as a well-understood style, whose features were fully perfected. The whole was used with a Doric sim plicity and boldness which is very re markable. Sometimes, it must be con fessed, this independence of constraint is carried a little too far, as in the pier arches at Jedburgh, where they are thrown across between the circular pillars without any subordinate shaft or apparent support. Here the excessive strength of the arch in great measure redeems it.\" The west door, the chief entrance, is a beautiful specimen of Norman architecture, and inside one very noticeable feature is the length of the nave, which consists of nine bays with aisles, and is said to be \" one of the finest examples of the Romanesque in Scotland.\" A LEGEND OF JEDBURGH. \"There is no river in this country which presents, in its course, scenes more beautifully romantic than the little Jed. Though it exhibits not the dizzy cliff's where the eagles build their nests, the mass of waters, the magnitude and the boldness, which give the character of sublimity to a scene; yet, as it winds its course through undulating hills where the forest trees entwine their broad branches, or steals along by the foot of the red rocky precipices, where the wild flowers and the broom blossom from every crevice of their perpendicular sides, and from whose summits the woods bend down, beautiful as rainbows, it presenteth pictures of surpassing loveliness, which the eye delights to dwell upon. It is a fair sight to look down from the tree-clad hills upon the ancient burgh, with the river half circling it, and gardens, orchards, woods, in the beauty of sum- mer blossoming, or the magnificence of their autumnal hues, encompassing it, while the venerable Abbey riseth stately in the midst of all as a temple in para dise. Such is the character of the scenery around Jedburgh now; and, in former ages, its beauty rendered it a favourite resort of the Scottish kings. Until very recently the Abbey was used for the service of the parish church, but about ten years ago the Marquis of Lothian built a new church at a cost of about \u00a316,000; and the grand old build ing now stands in its picturesque ruin, a tender memory of days that are gone. About the year 1270, an orphan boy, named Patrick Douglas, herded a few sheep upon the hills, which were the property of the monks of Melrose. Some of the brotherhood, discovering him to be a boy of excellent parts, instructed him to read and to write ; and perceiving the readiness with which he acquired these arts, they sought also to initiate him into all the learning of the age, and to bring him up for their order. To facilitate and complete his instruc tions, they had him admitted amongst them as a convert or lay-brother. But, though the talents of the shepherd boy caused him to be regarded as a prodigy by all within the monastery, from the We must pass over mention of any other of the public buildings ofthe little town, for we are going now to transcribe, for the benefit of our readers, a curious and interesting legend of the place, which we think it best to give, as nearly as may be, in its entirety.

Lord Abbot down to the kitchener and his assistants ; yet, with Patrick, as with many others even now, gifts were not when he left, the Abbot and the brethren bestowed their benediction and gifts upon him. He also carried with him letters graces. He had no de- sire to wear the white cassock, narrow scapu- lary, and plain linen hood ofthe Cistertian brethren ; neither did he possess the devoutness necessary for performing his devotions seven times a day; and, when the bell roused him at two in the morning, to what was called the nocturnal service, Patrick arose reluctantly ; for, though compelled to wedge himself into a nar- row bed at eight o'clock in the evening, it was his wont to lie awake, musing on what he had read or learned, until past midnight; and, when the nocturnal was over, he again retired to sleep, until he was aroused at six for matins; but, after these, came other de- votions called tierce, the sexte, the none, vespers, and the compline \u2014 at nine in the morning, at noon, at three in the afternoon, at six in the evening, and before eight.

Patrick, there fore, refused to take the monastic vow. He JEDBURGH, FROM ALLER ION, 'had heard of war, And longed to follow to the field some warlike lord.' He, however, was beloved by all ; and from the Lord Abbot and Prior, to men who were mighty in power at the court of King Philip of France."], [135, "JEDBURGH AND ITS LEGEND. 119 From the testimonials which he brought with him, Patrick Douglas, the Scottish orphan, speedily obtained favour in the eyes of King Philip and his nobles, and became as distinguished on the field for his prowess and the feats of his arms, as he had been in the Abbey of Melrose for his attainments in learn ing. But a period of peace came; and he who was but a few years before a shepherd boy by Tweedside, now bear ing honours conferred on him by a foreign monarch, was invited as a guest to the palace of the illustrious Count of Dreux. A hundred nobles were there, each exhibiting all the pageantry of the age; and there, too, were a hundred ladies, vying with each other in beauty and in the splendour of their array. But chief of all was Jolande, the daugh ter of their host, the Count of Dreux, and the fame of whose charms had spread throughout Christendom. Trou badours sang of her beauty, and princes bent the knee before her. Patrick Douglas beheld her charms. He gazed on them with a mixed feeling of awe, of regret, and of admiration. His eyes followed her, and his soul followed them. He beheld the devoirs which the great and the noble paid to her, and his heart was heavy : for she was the fairest and the proudest flower among the French nobility \u2014 he an exotic weed of desert birth. And, while princes strove for her hand, he remembered, he felt, that he w7as an orphan of foreign and of obscure parentage \u2014 a scholar by acci dent (but to be a scholar was no recom mendation in those days, and it is but sel dom that it is one even now), and a soldier of fortune, to whose name royal honours were not attached, while his purse was light, and who, because his feet covered more ground than he could call his own, was denied the insignia of knighthood. Yet, while he ventured not to breathe his thoughts or wishes before her, he imagined that she looked on him more kindly, and that she smiled on him more frequently than on his lordly rivals ; and his heart deceived itself, and re joiced in secret. Now, it was early in the year 12S3, the evening was balmy for the season, the first spring flowers were budding forth, and the moon, as a silver crescent, was seen among the stars. The young scholar and soldier of unknown birth walked in the gardens of the Count of Dreux, and the lovely Jolande leaned upon his arm. His heart throbbed as he listened to the silver tones of her sweet voice, and felt the gentle pressure of her soft hand in his. He forgot that she was the daughter of a prince \u2014 he the son of a dead peasant. In the delirium of a moment, he had thrown himself on his knee before her, he had pressed her hand on his bosom, and gazed eagerly in her face. She was startled by his manner, and had only said \u2014 \" Sir, what means ? \"- though in a tone neither of reproach nor of pride, when what she would have said was cut short by the sudden approach of a page, who, bowing before her, stated that four commissioners having arrived from the King of Scotland, the presence of the Princess Jolande was required at the palace. Patrick Douglas started to his feet as he heard the page approach, and as he listened to his words, he trem bled. The princess blushed, and turning from Patrick, proceeded in confusion towards the palace, while he followed at a distance, repenting of what he had said and of what he had done, or, rather, wishing that he had said more or said less. He fancied, how'ever, that she had not altogether discouraged his advances, and resolved at least that he would not despair. But what was his horror to find that the commissioners who had arrived were no others than Thomas Charteris, the Chancellor; Patrick de Graham, William de St. Clair, and John de Soulis; and that their business was to"], [136, "120 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. negotiate a marriage between his idolised Jolande and their king, Alexander the Third. thrown. When, however, their nuptials were finally agreed to, it was resolved that they should be celebrated on a scale of magnificence such as the world had never seen. Now the loveliest spot in broad Scotland, where the Scottish king could celebrate his gay festivities, was the good town of Jedureth, or Jedburgh. For it was situated [so says the partial chronicler] like an Eden, in the depth of an impenetrable forest ; gardens circled it; wooded hills surrounded it; precipices threw their shadows over flowery glens; wooded hills embraced it, as the union of many arms; waters murmured amidst it; and it was a scene on which man could not gaze without forgetting or regretting his fallen nature. Yea, the beholder might have said, \u2014 'If the earth be yet so lovely, how glorious must it have been ere it was cursed be cause of man's transgressions ! ' \" Alexander bore at that time a high character. He was described as the 'father of his people,' and as being like 'a husband to his kingdom;' he is .spoken of as being ' wise, just, resolute, and merciful,' and as being beloved in his own kingdom of Scotland and hon oured by all nations. But he had been sorely tried. One after another of his kinsfolk had died ; he had lived to see all his own family die before him; and his granddaughter was the only survivor of his house save himself. The nation, fearing that his line might become extinct, were anxious to see him wedded once more ; and Jolande was fixed upon by them as a fitting bride.\" Alas for poor Patrick! All his happy dreams seemed to be vanishing into thin air; and he blamed himself for indulging even for a moment a passion which, from the first, had been so imprudent, and which now he regarded as nothing less than a calamity. Such was the spot [a picture of Para dise, according to our chronicler] where the nuptials were to be celebrated, and whither the now not youthful, yet not old, Alexander went with his court to claim his future queen. And there, in the ancient castle, near to the Abbey, he took up his quarters ; while his nobles took up their abode in the neighbour hood. \"But before another sun rose [so runs the story], Patrick Douglas, the hon oured military adventurer of King Philip, was not to be found in the palace of the Count de Dreux. Many were the conjectures concerning his sudden de parture; and amongst those conjectures as regarding the cause, many were right. But Jolande stole to her chamber, and in secret wept for the brave stranger. On the very same day on which Alex ander arrived, Jolande and her attendants came to Jedburgh from France. Very grand was her company, as weare told; very gorgeous were their dresses; and the inhabitants ofjedburgh \u2014 then a popu lous place\u2014 looked in awe-struck ad miration upon all the royal grandeur which made their ancient town resplen dent. More than two years passed away, and the negotiations between the courts of Scotland and of France, respecting the marriage of King Alexander and fair Jolande, were continued ; but during that period, even the name of Patrick Douglas, the Scotch soldier, began to be forgotten \u2014 his learning became a dead letter, and his feats of arms continued no longer the theme of tongues. It is seldom that kings are such tardy wooers ; but between the union of the good Alexander and the beautiful Jolande many obstacles were \"The marriage ceremony was per formed in the Abbey, before Morel, the Lord Abbot, and glad assembled thousands.

The Scottish maiden and the French courtier danced by the side of the Jed together. But chief of all the festive scene was the assembly in the hall of the royal castle. At the further end of the apartment, elevated on a purple-covered dais, sat King Alex ander, with the hand of his bridal queen locked in his. On each side were ranged promiscuously the Scottish and the French nobility, with their wives, daugh ters, and sisters. Music lent its influence to the scene, and the strains of a hun dred instruments blended in a swell of melody. back, in horror, against a pillar where a torch-bearer stood. The lovely Queen shrieked aloud, and fell as dead upon the ground. The music ceased \u2014 silence fell on the multitude \u2014 they stood still \u2014 they gazed on each other. Dismay caused the cold damp of terror to burst from every brow, and timid maidens sought refuge and hid their faces on the bosom of strangers. But still, visible to all, the spectre stood before the King, its bare ribs rattling as it moved, and its finger pointed towards him. The music, the dancers, became noiseless, as if death had whispered \u2014 'Hush! be still!' For the figure of Death stood in the midst of them, as though it mocked them, and no sound was heard save the rattling of its bones, the moving of its teeth, and the motion of its fingers before the King. Thrice a hundred tapers burned sus pended from the roof, and on each side of the hall stood twenty men with branches of blazing pine. Now came the morris-dance, with the antique dress and strange attitudes of the performers, which was succeeded by a dance of war riors in their coats of mail, and with their swords drawn. After these a masque, prepared by Thomas the Rhymer, who sat on the right hand of the King, followed, and the company laughed, wept, and wondered, as the actors per formed their parts before them. The Lord Abbot gathered courage, he raised his crucifix from his breast, he was about to exorcise the strange spectre, when it bent its grim head be fore him, and vanished as it came \u2014 no man knew whither. ' Let the revels cease ! ' gasped the terror-stricken king ; and they did cease. The day had begun in joy, it was ended in terror. Fear spread over the land, and while the strange tale of the mar riage spectre was yet in the mouths of all men, yea, before six months had passed, the tidings spread that the good King Alexander, at whom the figure of Death had pointed its finger, was with the dead, and his young queen a widow in a strange land. But now came the royal dance; the music burst into a bolder strain, and lord and lady rose, treading the strange measure down the hall, after the King and his fair Queen. But lo! amid the resounding music and the many dancing, what change was this which came over the King's gaiety and turned the happy din into a hushed silence? The King had held out his hand to his bride, and a skeleton's fingers had grasped it in their grim hold. He shrank back aghast; for royalty shuddereth at the sight of Death as doth a beggar, and in its presence feeleth his power to be as the power of him who vainly commanded the waves of the sea to go back. Still the skeleton kept true measure before him \u2014 still it ex tended to him its bony hand. He fell The appearance of the spectre be came a tale of wonder amongst all men, descending from generation to generation, and unto this day it remains a mystery.

It is as if it had been contentwith its onegreat building \u2014 the Abbey. In tracing the history of this noble building, we must betake ourselves to Old Melrose, a village at a distance of about two miles from the modern town, for here first in 635 a religious house was founded, which in a succeeding generation had the honour of enrolling amongst its occupants the holy St. Cuthbert, the friend of the Venerable Bede, and which also had in its earliest history the privilege of being presided over by the saintly Aidan. It was a light in a dark time; and whatever it may have afterwards become, it was a stronghold of piety and zeal for long after its foundation. By-and-by it fell into ruins, and in 1 1 36, David I. \u2014 that \" nursing-father \" of the Church, whose munificence we have had again and again in these pages to commemorate \u2014 built instead the Abbey of Melrose on the fair green meadow which has become to us all a sacred spot in these latter times: the Abbey was occupied by Cistertian monks, and dedicated to the Virgin. With more zeal perhaps than wisdom, David set about the usual course of making the poor fraternity rich, and gave them the \"lands of Mel rose, Eldun, and Dernevie, Gattonside, the fishing of Tweed,\" \"pasturage and pannage \" in the forests of Selkirk and Traquair, and in that between the waters of the Gala and the Leader. By-and-by their possessions became wider still, stretching even into the counties of Ayr and Dumfries, till probably the honest monks hardly knew themselves where their property began, and where it ended. It was not long before the ownership of broad lands brought its show of con troversy and care, scarcely to be called of the spiritual order; and we learn how, in 1 184, but five decades from its foundations, William the Lion and his lords spiritual and temporal had to And of Melrose, how shall we speak fittingly? We can but tell somewhat of it in plain words, and then bid the kind reader, if he has not done so yet, go and see it for himself. The little town lies under a complete shelter of hills, the chief of these being the Eildons, of which we have already spoken. It does not possess many modern buildings of any note, the chief being one or two * Palgrave's Memoirs in the Globe edition of Scott."], [140, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 124 decide the vexed questions of \" pastur age \" and pannage between the Melrose monks (now, we fear, not so unworldly as in St. Cuthbert's day) and the \"men of Wedale.\" Like many other spots in the border-land, it became a place for the transaction of national affairs, and in 1285 the barons of Yorkshire swore fealty to the Scottish king in the chapter house of the Abbey. Darker times came soon, and 1322 saw the venerable house levelled with the ground, and its occupants slain. What was virtually a new Abbey was reared by Robert the Bruce four years afterwards at a cost of \u00a32,000, then an immense sum. Most fitly it became the treasure-house of Bruce's heart, which, after an unsuccess ful attempt to bury it in the Holy Sepulchre, was brought back to his native land, and laid here. In the course of the following century it passed through varying fortunes, which it is unnecessary here to detail; but the fifteenth century seems to have brought to it and its brotherhood a long and wel come interval of rest. With the changes of the sixteenth century, however, here as elsewhere, the ruthless hand of destruction came ; and twice in one year \u2014 the year 1545 \u2014 it was assailed by English forces, and sadly impoverished and destroyed. Finally it passed into secular hands, first being given by Queen Mary into the hands of the un worthy and miserable Earl of Bothwell ; next gifted to Sir John Ramsay, for having preserved the life of his king; and to Sir Thomas Hamilton, an ancestor of the noble family of Had dington; and last of all it was \"ac quired\" by the house of Buccleuch. The revenue of the monastery at the time of the Reformation is stated to have been as follows: \u2014 \"\u00a31,758 scots; wheat 19 chalders, 9 bolls ; bear 77 chalders, 3 bolls; oats 47 chalders, 1 boll, 2 firlots; meal 14 chalders; with 8 chalders of salt; 105 stones of butter; 10 dozen of capons ; 26 dozen of poultry; 376 muir-fowl; 360 loads of peat; and 500 carriages.\" Ofthe building itself, as it now stands, it has been truly said that the ruins \"afford the finest specimen of Gothic architecture and Gothic sculpture of which Scotland can boast.\" \"By singu lar good fortune, Melrose is also one of the most entire, as it is the most beauti ful, of all the ecclesiastical ruins scattered throughout this reformed land. To say that it is beautiful, is to say nothing. It is exquisitely, splendidly lovely. It is an object possessed of infinite grace, and unmeasurable charm; it is fine in its general aspect and its minute details, it is a study \u2014 a glory.\" We take the following more minute description at length from the same source : \u2014 \"Visitors usually approach by a stile leading from the east end of the village into the churchyard, so as first to get a view of the south side of the building. Having been reared in the form of a cross, with the upper part of that figure towards the east, that portion of the edifice which appears the most pro minent, is the south part of the transept, containing the main entrance. The arching of this doorway is composed of a semicircle with various members of the most delicate work falling behind each other, supported on light and well proportioned pilasters, with a projection on each side of rich tabernacle work. The cornices of this end of the structure are composed of angular buttresses, terminated by spires, also of tabernacle work. These buttresses are pierced with niches for statues ; the pedestals and canopies are of the lightest Gothic order, and ornamented by garlands of flowers in pierced work. Above the entrance are several niches for statues, decreasing in height as the arch rises, in which some mutilated effigies remain, many in standing positions, others sit ting, said to represent the apostles. In the centre are the arms of Scotland, a lion rampant, with a double tressure;"], [141, "BY THE TWEED ONCE MORE. 125 above which is the effigy of John the Baptist, to the waist, suspended in a cloud, casting his looks upward, and bearing on his bosom a fillet, inscribed 'Ecce filius Dei.' This is a very de licate sculpture, and in good preserva tion. On the buttress east ofthe door is the effigy of a monk; in his hand is a fillet extended, on which is inscribed, Passus e. q. ipse voluit [he suffered be cause himself willed it]. On the western buttress is the like effigy bearing a fillet, inscribed, Cu. venit Jesu seq. cessabit umbra [when Jesus appears, the darkness will pass away]. To the westward of this last effigy is the figure of a cripple on the shoulders of one that is blind, well executed ; under which may be read Unde Dei [anointed of God]. Above this south door is an elegant window, divided by four principal bars or mul lions, terminating in a pointed arch ; the tracery light, and collected at the summit into awheel; the stone-work of the whole window yet remaining perfect. This window is twenty-four feet in height within the arch, and sixteen in breadth ; the mouldings of the arch contain many members, graced with a filleting of foliage ; the outward member runs into a point of pinnacle work, and encloses a niche highly ornamented, which it is said contained the figure of our Lord. There are eight niches which sink gradually on the sides of the arch, formerly appropriated to receive the statues of the apostles. The whole south end rises to a point to form the roof, garnished by an upper moulding, which is ornamented by a fillet of ex cellent rose-work; the centre is termi nated by a square tower. It will suffice to remark, in this place, that the pedestals for statues in general are composed of five members of cornice, supported by palm boughs or some other rich wrought foliage, and terminat ing at the foot in a point with a triple roll. The caps, or canopies of the niches, are composed of delicate taber- nacle work, the spires ornamented by mouldings and a fillet of rose-work, and the suspended skirts graced by flowers; the interior of the canopy is of ribbed work, terminating in a suspended knot in the centre. This description will suffice to carry the reader's idea to every particular niche, without running into the tediousness of repetition. At the junction ofthe south and west members of the cross, a hexagon tower rises, terminating in a pinnacle roofed with stone, highly ornamented : from hence the aisle is extended so as to receive three large windows, whose arches are pointed, each divided by three upright bars or mullions, the tracery various and light, some in wheels, and others in the windings of foliage. These windows are separated by buttresses, ornamented by niches. Here are sculp tured the arms of several of the abbots, and that al so of the abbey, ' a mell, and a rose.' These buttresses support pinna cles of the finest tabernacle work. From the feet of these last pinnacles are extended bows or open arches, composed of the quarter division of a circle, abut ting to the bottom of another race of buttresses, which arise at the side wall of the nave ; each of these last buttresses also supporting an elegant pinnacle of tabernacle work, are ornamented by niches, in two of which statues remain, one of St. Andrew, the other of the Holy- Virgin ; the side aisles. are slated, but the nave is covered by an arched roof of hewn stone. From the west end of the church is continued a row of buildings containing five windows, divided by the like buttresses, the tracery of two of the windows remaining, the rest open ; each of these windows appertained to a sepa rate chapel, appropriated and dedicated to distinct personages and services; the places of the altar, and the fonts, or holy water basins, still remaining. At the west ern extremity of this structure on the last buttress, are the arms of Scotland, sup ported by unicorns collared and chained;"], [142, "126 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. the motto above broken, the letters E, G, J, S, only remaining. On one side is the letter J, on the other Q, and a date, 1505, which was the second year of the marriage of King James IV., a marriage concerted at this abbey between the king in person and Richard Fox, then Bishop of Durham. The east end of the church is composed of the choir, with a small aisle on each side, which appears to have been open to the high altar. This part is lighted by three windows towards the east, and two side windows in the aisle ; the centre window is divided by four upright bars or mullions; the traceries are of various figures, but chiefly crosses, which support a large complicated cross that forms the centre; the arching is pointed, and part of the tracery here is broken. The side-lights are nearly as high as the centre, but very narrow, divided by three upright bars or mullions; the mouldings of the window-arches are small and delicate, yet ornamented with a fillet of foliage. On each side of the great window are niches for statues, and at the top there appear the effigies of an old man sitting, with a globe in his left hand rested on his knees, with a young man on his right; over their heads an open crown is sus pended. These figures, it is presumed, represent the Father and the Son. The buttresses at this end terminate in pin nacles of tabernacle work ; the mouldings and sculptures are elegantly wrought. The north end of the cross-aisle of the abbey is not much ornamented externally, it having adjoined to the cloister and other buildings. The door which leads to the site of the cloister (the building being demolished) is a semicircular arch of many members ; the fillet of foliage and flowers is of the highest finishing that can be conceived to be executed in freestone, it being pierced with flowers and leaves separated from the one be hind, and suspended in a twisted garland. In the mouldings, pinnacle-work, and foliage of the seats, which remain of the cloister, it is understood that there is as great excellence to be found as in any stonework in Europe, for lightness, ease, and disposition. Nature is studied through the whole, and the flowers and plants are represented as accurately as under the pencil. In this fabric there are the finest lessons, and the greatest variety of Gothic ornaments that the island affords, take all the religious structures together The length of the edifice, from east to west, is 258 feet, the cross-aisle 137 feet, and the whole contents of its iconography 943 feet. The north aisle is lighted by a circular window, representing a crown of thorns, which makes an uncommon appearance. Here are the effigies of Peter and Paul, one on each side of the tower, but of inferior sculpture. It is said that Alexander II. lies buried at the high altar, beneath the east window. There is a marble slab, the form of a coffin, on the south side of the high <ytar; but it bears no inscription, and is^yp posed to be that of Gualterus, or Wailr, the second abbot, who was canonised. The chronicle of Melrose contains the anecdote that Ingerim, Bishop of Glas gow, and four abbots, came to Melrose to open the grave after twelve years' interment, when they found the body of Gualterus uncorrupted, on which, with a religious rapture, they exclaimed, Vere hu homo Dei est. They afterwards placed a marble monument over the remains. . . . Many altars, basins for holy-water, and other remains of separate chapels, appear in the aisles, among which are those of St. Mary and St. Waldave.\" Melrose, unlike Cologne, has had pre served to it the name of its architect, and the following rude inscription may be seen on the wall at the entrance of the south transept : \u2014 \"John Murrow sum tyme callit was I : and born in parysse certainly : and had in kepyng al mason werk of santan droys : ye hige kyrk of \u2014 glas gw : Melros : and paslay : of nyddys : dayll : and : of: geelway : pray : to god : and : mari : bath : and\""], [143, "127 ABBOTSFORD AND SIR WALTER.

But Purdie's face shone with rapture as he observed how severely the swag-bellied bookseller's activity was tasked. Scott exclaimed, exult ingly, though, perhaps, for the tenth time, 'This will be a glorious spring for our trees, Tom !

I have followed you distinctly, and I feel as if I were to be myself again.'\" As we walked homeward, Scott, being a little fatigued, laid his left hand on Tom's shoulder, and leaned heavily for support, chatting to . . . the affectionate fellow just as freely as with the rest of the party ; and Tom put in his word shrewdly and manfully, and grinned and grunted whenever the joke chanced to be within his apprehension. It was easy to see that his heart swelled within him from the moment the Sheriff got his collar in his grip.\" On the 17th of September he sent for Lockhart eariy, and, with much calmness, he spoke to him, bidding him \" be virtuous \u2014 be religious,\" and adding that \"nothing else would give him any comfort when he came to lie there.\" Four days later, in the presence of all his sons and daughters, he breathed his last. \" It was a beautiful day,\" writes Lock hart, \" so warm that every window was wide open, and so perfectly still that the sound of all others most delicious to his ear, the gentle ripple of the Tweed over its pebbles, was distinctly audible as we knelt around the bed, and his eldest son kissed and closed his eyes.\" Such was the Abbotsford of Scott's heyday of prosperity : we add one picture more, of a very different kind. The great poet and man of letters is dying, and, having sought health in vain in more genial climes, he turns once more home to Abbotsford. As they rounded the hill at Ladhope (he and Lockhart), so writes the latter, and \"the outline of the Eildons burst on him, he became greatly excited; and when, turning him self on his couch, his eye caught at length his own towers, at the distance of a mile, he sprang up with a cry of de light. Mr. Laidlaw was waiting at the porch, and assisted us in lifting him into the dining-room, where his bed had been prepared. He sat bewildered for a few moments, and then, resting his eye on Laidlaw, said, ' Ha ! Willie Laidlaw ! O man, how often have I thought of you!

Sir Walter is \"kith and kin \" to us all. Yarrow I EAVING Abbotsford and coming to Yar ' row, we still find ourselves among the poets : from its head at St. Mary's Loch to its junction with In summertide, so soft they weep, The sound but lulls the ear asleep : Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude, So stilly is the solitude.\" A \"stilly solitude\" indeed it is\u2014 or rather was : for now, thanks to the poet who wrote these lines, and to others who have celebrated its beauties, all through the summer, parties of tourists from Moffat and Selkirk, from Innerleithen and from Peebles, find their way to St. Mary's and to the wild waterfall in its neighbourhood\u2014 Grey Mare's Tail. But even yet, for all the Americans with their Baedekers, Cockneys with those Scotch bonnets which the Scotchman does not wear, \"Hydropathic\" people from Moffat and Melrose, etc., etc., there is a wondrous quietude about the place: \"the mountains speak peace to the people\" and the streams echo it, each in its quiet bed. St. Mary's, we may tell the reader, is about three miles long and from half-a- mile to a mile broad. And we may also tell him that whilst poets and tourists have delighted to honour it, we have known of some good people near to it who did not think very much of it. Some friends of ours once proposed to an excellent farmer, whom they were visiting in the neighbourhood, that they should go and see the famous lake. \"Oh,\" said he, \"I'll drive ye there gladly; but what d'ye want to gang for ? what needs ye stand glowerin' (staring) at a loch ? \" It may perhaps do some of our more the Ettrick near the ancient castle of Newark, its whole course may be said to have been celebrated in song.

But Yarrow kirk and its neighbourhood have other interests; for if you go a little way from it to the westward you will see two high stones marking the place of a conflict between John Scott of Tushielaw and Walter Scott of Thirlstane over the matter of a marriage dowry, which has formed the groundwork of much of the minstrelsy of Yarrow.

A Legend of Elibank. PON a little spur of Now in those times cattle-lifting was one of the most usual methods of making war upon an enemy. Some fine moon light night a laird and his retainers would wander forth and get into his neighbour's territory, and before day break he and his band would be return ing homeward driving some choice sheep and cattle before him. Bearing this in mind, the motto of the Scotts of Harden, Reparabit comua Phoebe (which in free rendering means \u2014 \" the moon shall return again\"), has a significance all its own. It tells how if during the moonlight nights of one month some of the Harden cattle were carried off, a new moon would give opportunity for reprisals. the hills by Tweed- side, between Clo- venfords and In- nerleithen, stands a ruin called Elibank Tower, around which has entwined itself a romantic and withal somewhat amusing story. This legend illustrates so well the relations which the old Border families were wont to sustain toward each other, that we shall give it here as briefly as we can, leaving the reader to seek the story in more detail in that charming collection of legends to which we have had so much occasion to refer \u2014 Wilson's \"Tales ofthe Borders.\" Well, upon a certain night in October, when the moon was full, Will Scott of Harden said to his retainers, \u2014 \"Look ye, friends, is it not a crying sin and a national shame to see things going aglee as they are doing ? There seems hardly such a thing as manhood left upon the Borders. A bit scratch with a pen upon parchment is becoming of more effect than a stroke with the sword. A bairn At the time in which the incident to which we are to refer took place \u2014 i.e., early in the seventeenth century \u2014 there was a serious feud between Murray, the laird of Elibank, the ancestor of Lord Elibank, and the Scotts of Harden, who resided at Oakwood in Ettrick, and who were the ancestors of Lord Polwarth, and a branch ofthe house of Buccleua\"h."], [149, "A LEGEND OF ELIBANK. 133 now stands as good a chance to hold and to have, as an armed man that has a hand to take and to defend. Such a state o' things was only made for those who are owre lazy to ride by night, and uwre cowardly to fight. .. Never shall it be said that I, William Scott, of Harden, was one who either submitted or con formed to it. .Give me the good old manly law, that ' they shall keep who can,' and wi' my honest sword will I maintain my right against every enemy. Now, there is our natural and lawful ad versary, auld Sir Gideon Murray o' Eli bank, carries his head as high as though he were first cousin to a king, or the sole lord o' Ettrick Forest. More than once has he slighted me in a way which it wasna for a Scott to bear ; and weel do I ken that he has the will, and wants but the power, to harry us o' house an' ha'. But, by my troth, he shall pay a dear reckoning for a' the insults he has offered to the Scotts o' Harden. Now, every Murray among them has a weel-stocked mailing, and their kine are weel favoured; to-night the moon is laugh ing cannily through the clouds : \u2014 therefore, what say ye neighbours \u2014 will ye ride wi' me to Elibank ? and before morning, every man o' them shall have a toom byre.\" bank, with fifty sturdy followers \u2014 thirty more than those of Scott \u2014 who was close upon them. The fact was, that Harden had not been so clever as he thought, for Sir Gideon had got early notice of the raid, and had watched the lifters in the moonlight as they drove away the cattle. He allowed them to get well on the way home, and then with the words \"Now for the onset!\" he called upon his men to follow7. The stratagem was so successful that before Scott had time to gather his men about him, he was surrounded. Some angry words passed between the two chiefs, and Scott and his men did not yield themselves with out a desperate struggle, which has been thus described : \u2014 \"The conflict began, and on each side the strife was bloody and desperate. Bold men grasped each other by the throat, and they held their swords to each other's breasts, scowling one upon another with the ferocity of contending tigers, ere each gave the deadly plunge which was to hurl both into eternity. The report of fire-arms, the clash of swords, the clang of shields, with the neighing of maddened horses, the low- ing of affrighted cattle, the howl of the sleuth-hounds, and the angry voices of fierce men, mingled wildly together, and, in one fearful and discordant echo, rang through the forest. This wild sound was followed by the low, melan- choly groans of the dying. But as I have already stated, the Scotts, and the cattle which they drove before them, were scattered, and ere those who were in advance could arrive to the rescue of their friends in the rear, the latter were slain, wounded, or overpowered. They also fought against fearful odds. The young laird himself had his sword broken in his grasp, and his horse was struck dead beneath him. He was instantly surrounded and made prisoner by the Murrays ; and, at the same time, old Simon [a favourite retainer] also fell into their hands.\" The men to whom the words were spoken, were just of the sort to rejoice in the proposal, so with one unanimous shout of \" Hurrah,\" they set themselves to get their horses in readiness, and were soon on the way to Elibank, armed with \" firelocks \" orwith \"Jeddart staves\" and with swords. Arrived at the scene of their depredations, they seemed to be in luck : all Elibank appeared to be asleep ; and before the dawn cattle were being driven before them in hundreds back to Oakwood. But, in the midst of their triumph, they were suddenly surprised by hearing a very unwelcome shout \u2014 \"To-night for Sir Gideon and the House of Elibank' \" It was Sir Gideon Murray, laird of Eli-"], [150, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 134 Fear put \" life and mettle in the heels \" of the less brave of Scott's men, and so it came about that only Scott and this one follower were brought in triumph \u2014 along with the recovered cattle \u2014 to Eli bank. driven to the place of execution. \" Hangin's ill,\" said the man, \"but marryin's waur; drive on the cart.\" Scott's answer was defiant and insult ing : \u2014 \"Look ye, sir,\" said he; \"I am Scott o' Harden, and ye are Murray o' Elibank; there is no love lost between us ; chance has placed my life in your hands \u2014 take it, for I wouldna marry your daughter though ye should gie me life, and a' the lands o' Elibank into the bargain. I fear as little to meet death as I do to throw in your teeth that, had ye fallen into my hands, I would have hung ye wi' as little ceremony as I would bring a whip across the back o' a dis obedient hound. Therefore, ye are wel come to do the same by me. Ye have taken what ye thought to be a sure mode o' getting a husband for ane o' your -winsome daughters; but in the pre sent instance, it has proved a wrong one, auld man. Do your worst, and there will be Scotts enow left to revenge the death o' the laird o' Harden.\" Murray, who was ferocious when roused, determined that Scott should die, and accordingly intimated to him and his companion that they should hang upon the nearest elm-tree the following morn. But the fierce chief had a wife, more wise and more gentle than him self; and, moreover, his family consisted of three very plain-looking daughters, whom no neighbouring laird seemed to fancy. So, thought Lady Murray, here might be a means both of saving young Scott's life and of perpetuating the house of Murray, which was like to become extinct. Why not offer him his life, if he would marry Agnes, or \" Muckle mouthed Meg,\" as she was always called \u2014 the most ill-favoured of the three, but withal a very gentle maid?* Sir Gideon agreed to offer Scott the choice \u2014 \"Mucklemouthed Meg \" or the halter; but he gave his wife little hope that the stubborn laird of Harden would accept life upon the terms. Lady Murray went to prepare her daughter for the proposal : and her husband went at the same time to offer to Scott the strange alternative. The laird of Elibank brought back the news of Scott's haughty refusal to his wife and daughter. Meg besought her father to allow four days to elapse before the sentence of execution should be car ried out, in order to let Scott and herself become acquainted, and so lead him, perhaps, to choose the \" wife \" rather than the \" wuddy : \" and the laird some what reluctantly consented. Thereupon the gentle, if not bonnie, Meg dressed herself as a domestic, and found means of admission to the place where Scott was imprisoned. Introducing herself as a serving-maid \u2014 \"a despised lassie, and an attendant upon Sir Gideon's lady,\" she told Scott that she had come, at her lady's instance, to say that, if he had any message to send to his mourning relatives at Oakwood, she would bear it. She also endeavoured to say a good word for \" Meg \"\u2014namely, herself, reminding him that perhaps, after all, she was better than she was bonnie, and that he should not judge of her without seeing \"Now,\" said he, \"ye rank marauder, though death is the very least that ye deserve or can expect from my hands, yet I will gie ye a chance for your life, and ye shall choose between a wife and the wuddy. To-morrow morning, ye shall either marry my daughter, Meg, or swing from the branch o' the nearest tree, and the bauldest Scott upon the Borders shaunna tak ye down, until ye drop away, bone by bone, a fleshless skeleton.\" But the proud young laird was as bad as that other condemned man who was once, so the story goes, offered a free pardon upon the same terms while being"], [151, "A LEGEND OF ELIBANK. 135 her. On this point, however, he was obdurate; but he gladly availed himself of her kind offer to take a letter to his mother. He wrote, taking farewell of her, asking her to look after the wife and children of poor Simon, who was thinking anxiously about them in the prospect of death, and telling his mother about the kindness ofthe maiden who was the bearer ofthe letter; and, before he had finished, he had declared that, if he were free, he would make her his wife. There being nothing more to be said, the laird of Harden and his retainer Simon were led forth to a tall elm-tree; and the laird of Elibank and his people gathered around it to witness the execu tion. But just as the hangmen were preparing to do their deadly work, Meg, heavily veiled, came out, and besought her father for \" a simple boon,\" and whispered something in his ear. Rather gruffly, her father indicated assent, and now going to his enemy once more he made a new offer. We give the rest of the story as it is given in Wilson's \"Tales\" : \u2014 Meg, faithful to her mission, and still disguised, made her way speedily to Oakwood, and in conversation with Scott's mother said so much that was good of Sir Gideon's daughter that she also became anxious that her son should marry her. The old lady, at Meg's invitation, returned with her to Elibank, disguised as a peasant woman : and they came just in time, for Sir Gideon, im patient to see his enemy on the gallows tree, had resolved to shorten the respite. Meg saw Scott first, and then, without letting him know\" that his mother was by, ushered her into his presence. Lady Scott rushed into his arms, and pleaded with him to marry Murray's daughter, assuring him that if he refused, it would be her own death as well as his. But even a mother's tears would not move him. \"Rise, Meg, rise!\" said he impatiently, \" for yer sake, an' at yer request, he shall hae another chance to live.\" And approaching the prisoner, he added \u2014 \" William Scott, ye hae chosen death in preference to the hand o' my dochter. Will ye noo prefer to die rather than marry the lassie that ranwi' the letter to yer mother, an' without my consent brought her to see ye? \" \"Had another asked me the question,\" said the laird, \"though I ken not who she is, yet she has a kind heart, and I should hae said ' No,' an' offered her my hand, heart, and fortune; but to you Sir Gideon, I only say \u2014 do your worst.\" \"Then Willie, my ain Willie!\" cried his mother, who at that moment rushed forward, \"another does request ye to marry her, an' that is yer ain mother ! \" \" My determination,\" said he, \" is fixed as fate. I shall welcome my doom, an' meet it as a man. Come, dear mother, weep not, nor cause me to appear in the presence o' my enemies with a blanched cheek. Hasten to avenge my death, an' think that in yer revenge yer son lives again. Come, though I die, there will be moonlight again.\" \"An',\" said Agnes, stepping forward, and throwing aside the veil that covered her face, \" puir Meg, owre w'hom ye gied a preference to the gallows, also requests ye ! \" \"What! \" exclaimed the young laird, grasping her hand, \"is the kind lassie that has striven night and day to save me \u2014 the very Meg that I hae been treat ing with disdain ? \" The hour of noon arrived, and with it the command of the warder \u2014 \"It is the hour! prepare the prisoners for execu tion ! \" Sir Gideon entered the prison, and offered the alternative once more \u2014 \" a wife or the wuddy ? \" which was answered by Scott with a demand to be led to execution. \" In troth am I,\" she replied, \" an' co ye prefer the wuddy still ? \" \"No,\" answered he; and turning to Sir Gideon, he added \u2014 \" I am now willing that this ceremony end in matrimony.\""], [152, "136 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. to say that it was political plundering; rather let us say in all charity, that it arose from the difficulty of \" riding the marches,\" and so of exactly knowing what was one's own and what was another's. We think w7e have known of many boasted \"annexations\" which have little more to be said for them. \"Beit so,\" said the old knight, and the spectators burst into a shout. The day that began with preparations for death, ended in a joyful bridal. The honour of knighthood was afterwards conferred upon the laird; and Meg bore unto him many sons and daughters ; and was, as the reader will be ready to believe, one of the best wives in Scotland. Be this as it may, however, it is plea sant to think that the border-men of to-day live in a more peaceful fashion ; indeed, no more tranquil a people will be found anywhere than the people of the border. When Scotts and Murrays meet, it is as neighbours and brethren, not as foes; and we can picture to our selveshow sometimes they occupy agenial hour by recalling the old-fashioned tale of \" Muckle-mouthed Meg.\" Such is a story of the wild ways which were common on the border-lands in the olden time. It would appear from it that the \"cattle-lifting\" which was so extensively practised, was not carried on merely between lairds on. the English and lairds on the Scottish side of the border, but also between those whose estates adjoined, though both on Scot tish soil.

But we must bid our reader turn to Sir Walter's delightful pages for a description of its natural beauties, as well as of the somewhat tawdry glories of fashion which it boasted in earlier days. We come now to Peebles, which lies a few miles up the Tweed from Innerleithen, and is notable both for its own sake, and for its place in the midst of one of the richest \" bits \" of Tweedside scenery \u2014 aye, and of southern Highland scenery too. We are often astonished that the tourist so seldom finds his way to Peebles; and that, if he does, he makes so brief a sojourn there. He talks in wild rapture about the Trossachs : he tells you of the delights of Aberfeldy, and grows almost poetic about the scenery around Kingussie. But you talk of Peebles, and he tells you artlessly that he has passed through it in the train, perhaps. We are inclined to account for this in part from the fact that, in a country so rich in fair land- scapes, there are many comparatively neglected spots of necessary conse- quence ; and in part because travellers are in a hurry to get further north ; and, having spent a little time at Melrose and Abbotsford, are fain to push on. Per haps, too, the little town has itself to blame for being so little known, for it has been rather lazy, and has shown but little enterprise. But let us tell the reader that if he would spend a brief holiday amidst delightful scenery which yet has not become too common, and would, moreover, breathe unhindered the uncorrupted air of the hills, he may take his way wisely thither. It is but 22 miles from Edinburgh \u2014 a slow hour's journey by train. Let him take with him Pro fessor Veitch's charming book on the Poetry and History of the Scottish Bor der, and dear John Brown's exquisite paper upon \"Minchmoor;\" let him, moreover, have with him \"St. Ronan's,\" already spoken of; let him have rod and fly for use in lazy days ; and let him take his best book with him and dream with new realisation of the Power which causeth \"the grass to grow upon the mountains\" and \" sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills.\" It will be enough for him, when his spirit is weary, to go and stand upon the bridge, and get soothing as he looks down upon the pure and placid, yet rapid, river; and if the weather should chance to be rainy \u2014 as it sometimes is in Scotland \u2014 he may spend a delightful hour in the Chambers Institution, whose library and museum will form a lasting memorial to two men (one of them happily still with us) who have, by their enter prise and zeal, done much alike to redeem their native town from the charge of indolence, and to reflect honour upon it ; we mean William and Robert Cham bers. It may now be interesting to F"], [154, "138 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. have some little account of the place. Its history can be traced back to the beginning of the Scoto-Saxon period, at which time, says George Chalmers, in his Caledonia, \"there was undoubtedly here a village, a church, a mill, and a brew-house ; \" and he opines that there may have been about the same time a castle and a chapel attached. That the latter did exist in the end of the 12th century, is proved by the fact that the then bishop of Glasgow assigned to the monks at Kelso \" the chapel of the castle of Peebles.\" It is supposed that in those early times it was often visited by the king and his court, for whom a great part of the south of Scotland was a kind of \"happy hunting-ground.\" One not able event in its early history was the gift to it by Alexander III. of a church, which was named the Cross-church. The gift came about after this fashion. Upon the 7th of May, 1261, according to the chronicler Fordun, was found \"a certain and magnificent and venerable cross,\" which was believed to be \" the very cross of the martyred St. Nicholas,\" who was put to death in the Maximian per secution. An urn was also discovered, containing what was believed to be the sacred dust of this saint; and, in cele bration of these not very wonderful dis coveries, the Cross-church and monastery were erected upon the place. Probably the one fragment of evidence for the St. Nicholas story was that his name was upon the cross which was discovered. At the Reformation the Cross-church became the parish church. Of the Peebles of considerably later days everybody is bound to quote the description of Dr. Pennycuick, whose muse was rather topographical, we sup pose, than imaginative : \u2014 Peblis, the metropolis ofthe shire, Six times three praises do from me require ; Three streets, three ports, three bridges it adorn, And three old steeples, by three churches, born ; Three mills to serve their town in time of need, On Peebles water and the river Tweed. Their arms are proper, and point forth their mean- ing. Three salmon fishes nimbly counter-sweening. To our thinking, there is not much ir the structural aspect ofthe quiet town to distract attention from those higher attractions of surrounding scenery to which we have referred. But you are not w7ell out of the town going up the Tweed ere you come to the castle of Neidpath, majestic even in its ruin, and by its position adding a fresh beauty to the already fair river. This castle be longed to Simon Fraser, who, in his day, was sheriff of the shire, from whom it passed into the family of the Hays, and finally into those of Queensberry and of Wemyss. Of a legend connected with it we give the following account, which is given in a preface to Scott's ballad, \" The Maid of Neidpath \" :\u2014 \"There is,\" says he, \"a tradition in Tweedale, that when Neidpath Castle, near Peebles, was inhabited by the Earls of March, a mutual passion subsisted between a daughter of that noble family and a son of the laird of Tushielaw, in Ettrick Forest. As the alliance was thought unsuitable by her parents, the young man went abroad. During his absence the lady fell into a consumption. and, at length, as the only means of saving her life, her father consented that her lover should be recalled. On the day when he was expected to pass through Peebles, on the road to Tushie law, the young lady, though much ex hausted, caused herself to be carried to the balcony of a house in Peebles, be- A famous poem, entitled, \"Peblis to the Play,\" which is ascribed to James I., the poet-king of Scotland, gives a picture of life in the ancient town in his day, and especially of a notable fair which was there held on May-day. This fair, which was called Beltane, is supposed to have meant \" fire of Baal,\" and the custom is thought by Chambers to point back to a pre-historic worship of Baal which he be lieves to have been practised in Scotland."], [155, "PEEBLES AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD. \u25a039 longing to the family, that she might see him as he rode past. Her anxiety and eagerness gave such force to her organs, that she is said to have distinguished his horse's footsteps at an incredible dis tance. But Tushielaw, unprepared for the change in her appearance, and not expecting to see her in that place, rode on without recognising her, or even slackening his pace. The lady was unable to support the shock, and, after a short struggle, died in the arms of her attendants.\" to Drummelzier, to the junction of the Powsail and the Tweed. But, dear reader, we cannot make these with you in the time we have at our disposal. Let us only close our article by refer ring to the last of these, over which hangs a tale of superstition, which it may please the curious to study. \"Near the influx of Powsail with the Tweed,\" says Chalmers, \" a thorn-tree marks the sacred spot where lies inhumed the prophet Merlin. Tradition has preserved his tale; superstition has repeated his saws ; and the finger of age points to the eye of curiosity the very grave of Merlin. Our prophet was the cause of prophecy in others; and during King James's time, some seer foretold that The ballad itself is singularly beauti ful, and we hope we shall be pardoned for giving it entire: \u2014 \" 0 lovers' eyes are sharp tc see, And lovers' ears in hearing ; And love, in life's extremity, Can lend an hour of cheering. ' When Tweed and Powsail meet, at Merlin's grave, Scotland and England shall one monarch have.' \" Disease had been in Mary's bower, And slow decay from mourning Though now she sits on Neidpath's tower, To watch her love's returning. \"Doctor Pennycuick,\" he adds, \"has recorded the fulfilment of this prophecy: ' On the same day,' says the Doctor, that our King James was crowned King of England, the river Tweed so far over flowed its banks, that it met with Pow sail. at the said grave, by such an extraordinary flood as had never been observed before nor since that time.' Yet has the Doctor left it undecided whether the prophecy begat the flood, or ihe flood the prophecy.\" It is not, however, Pennycuick alone who seems to have trusted this tradition, for Scott, in his notes to the \" Vision of Don Roderick,\" seems to give some credence to it. The localisation is as old as Fordun the old chronicler, who devotes a chapter of his work to an account of the death of Merlin near to Drummelzier, which, Scott remarks, is supposed to have received its name \u2014 Tumulus Merlini \u2014 from this fact. The story, true or false, has other interests than those which immediately appear; for the as sociation of the old British \"prophet\" with the Scottish border is only one more added to the many evidences that this All sunk and dim her eyes so bright, Her form decayed by pining.

Park and Castle, the home of the Earl of Rosebery. We leave Edinburgh from the west end of Princes-street, and go along the Queensferry-road, passing, amongst other places of interest, Craig crook, where Lord Jeffrey for a long time resided. By-and-by we come to the sweet little village of Cramond, and crossing the bridge, find ourselves very soon in the midst of a group of beauti ful residences, among them \u2014 perhaps chief among them \u2014 Dalmeny Park.

The modern mansion is, as our illustration will show, a very handsome building; but, handsome as it is, one thinks of it less for what it is in itself, than for the fair domain in which it stands. The house, however, has all the added honours and interest which comes from being occupied by a family noble in character as in estate: and, writing as we do at a time when an Earl of Rosebery stands high in the friendship of a Prime Minister, and in the councils of the English nation, we may safely say that the ancient family of Primrose shows no token of decline. The visitor is interested to find in the grounds, besides the modern house, the ancient castle of Barnbough, now in ruins, which belonged to the old family of Mowbray, and passed into the hands of the house of Rosebery. Farewell to the Borders. Here we must close our rambles upon the borders, leaving much undone. We have not been able even to take our readers up, as we would willingly have done, to the higher reaches of the river Tweed, where, a little rivulet, it finds its being high up among the hills \u2014 not far from where the river Clyde also takes its rise, to run in a far different course, and to be as it were the silent witness of far other scenes than the rapid, yet placid, Tweed.

We retrace our steps now to Edin burgh, from thence to start again on our wanderings, first of all moving a little to the westward, and then turning our face by way of Stirling to the north.

J^INLITHGOW AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS. The Palace \u2014 JVLary Stuart \u2014 Murder of the Regent Murray. INLITHGOW is one qualities of human nature. The history of Scotland is very much mixed up with its towns. Of course this is the case in every country, but peculiarly so in this; and of the minor towns it is specially true of Linlithgow, for Linlithgow Palace and the ancient parish church of St. Michael are bound up with some of the most stirring events in Northern annals. Good St. Michael is the patron saint of the old burgh, and in his honour the church was erected by David the First. It was richly decorated by Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, escaped destruction during the fierce convulsions of the Reformation, and is still used for divine worship. One strange tradition is connected with it. James V. was staying at the palace a short time before the battle of Flodden. He had determined, against the advice of the wisest of his councillors, to make the raid into England which terminated so disastrously alike for himself and for his kingdom. He was worshipping in the church when there suddenly appeared before him a vision as from another world. It was dressed in \" an azure coloured robe, girt with a girdle or sash of linen, having sandals on its feet, with long yellow hair, and a grave, command ing countenance.\" of those quiet, ancient Scotch towns which, though they do not possess any very great features of special interest, have yet a distinct and busy life of their own, which might \u2014 as a type, at any rate \u2014 well re pay close attention. It is in in h i ommunities, indeed, that what is most distinctive in Scotch life longest lingers. The course of Scotch history has been such that all the greater institutions of the country have been one by one swept away. The crown is merged in the greater diadem of the British Empire ; the old faith has been long succeeded by a simpler and purer worship; the parliament is now something associated with London, and not with Edinburgh ; and yet, quiet and undisturbed by these portentous changes, the burghers still meet in council, and devise plans for the good of the com munity, as their forefathers did when England was a name of terror, and when they had, many a time, one of their own Scottish kings of the ancient and unhappy house of Stuart for their fellow towns man. The lower life and the minor organisations of the country have been preserved, while what is above them has been destroyed, or, at least, has taken other forms. It is both a cause and a result of this that the Scottish people have been more faithful to their national Church and to their national life than the \"upper classes\" \u2014 their supe riors in wealth and culture, yet their inferiors in many of the more sterling In a voice whose accents froze with horror the king and his courtiers, it solemnly warned him to desist from his intended expedition, and then it vanished as suddenly as it appeared, without any present daring to bar its path. Even in that superstitious age there were not wanting men ready to give a natural and easy explanation to this remarkable occurrence. It was said that the oppo nents of the war had dressed up some"], [159, "LINLITHGOW AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS. 143 one \"to represent Saint John, called in Scripture the adopted son of the Virgin Mary.\" The king was weak and credulous, but, like many weak and credulous persons, he was likewise ex ceedingly obstinate. He, at any ratei gave no heed to the warning, which, no doubt, would have received little atten tion had the English foray resulted in victory. Yet, when this was not the case, and when, round many a winter fire in the long desolate years that fol lowed, men told each other \" sad stories of the death of kings,\" and how, in this most fatal of all Scottish battles, the \" flowers of the forest were a' weed away,\" we cannot doubt that this story of the warning conveyed in vain from another world to the headstrong monarch would serve to shed something of super natural awe \u2014 of the light that never was on sea or shore \u2014 over the greatest disaster in Scottish history. Many memories of the old Scottish kings, and of the royal house of Stuart, hang round this palace of Linlithgow, but one surpasses all others. The first room on the west side as you enter was the birthplace of the beautiful and unfor tunate Mary. Here, on the 7th of December, 1542, during one of the darkest periods of her country's history, she first saw the light. A story is con nected with her birth which, though it is well enough known, is yet of so pathetic and interesting a character, that we cannot but repeat it. The last years of James V. had been filled with misfortune. The disgraceful routs of Fala and Solway Moss, and the death 01 his two sons, pierced his very soul. He retired to Falkland Palace, and there he lay sick \"unto death.\" They toldhim, near the end, that the crown of his ancestors was not to pass out of the direct line, for that his wife had given birth to a daugh ter. Perhaps the attendants hoped the news might help to revive the dying monarch ; but he heard it with but little apparent interest. Things of this world no longer seemed to interest him. Yet, in a half-dreaming way, he pondered over the news. He remembered that two centuries ago, his ancestor, Walter, the Lord High Steward of Scotland, had married Marjory, the daughter of the great Bruce, and that thus the crown had come into the possession of his race. A fateful coincidence seemed to strike him as he muttered with a sigh the well known sentence, \" Is it so ? Then God's will be done. It came with a lass, and it will go with a lass.\" And, so saying, the last of the purely Scottish kings passed away. The palace, we need hardly say, is now a complete ruin, though here, as elsewhere, the precious relics are cherished with a care which forms a striking contrast to former neglect. It was tolerably complete till the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745-46. The English soldiers employed to stifle the revolt were not, as is well known, at all successful until the very end. Mortified by the ignominious defeat ofPrestonpans, and the clever manner in which they were out-manoeuvred by the young prince, they committed a good many unjustifiable acts, one of the worst of Wiiich was the destruction, by a so-called accident, ofthe old palace of the Scottish tmo-s by a detachment under General Hawley. As it originally stood, the palace was a strongly-built quadrangular buildin<-*\\ The principal entrance is to the south. The great hall was on the right, and in the centre of the quadrangle there was a fountain, of which the one that now stands before Holyrood House is a copy. The whole building is within a stone' s-throw of Linlithgow Loch. This is, of course, not the place to trace the career of Mary Stuart; nor to attempt to discuss the question of her guilt or innocence. It is not even the place to attempt an estimate of her cha racter. It can hardly be denied that she was, in many respects, a guilty woman ; still, whatever her crimes, it is also true"], [160, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 144 that she possessed many virtues; she had a royal magnificence and generosity of nature \u2014 a more than royal skill and courage. As of another character, it may be truly said of her, \" that nothing in life so became her as the leaving of it.\" As we read the story of her execution, retold to us for the hundredth time by Froude, in one of the most marvellous pieces of word painting in the whole range of English literature, we confess, that, like her grandson, she \"met death with the placid courage that half re deemed her fame.\" Whatever we may think of the crimes ofthe queen, we must drop atear over thesorrows ofthe woman. The world has come to acknowledge this, and hence the profound interest that men have taken in the marvellous story of her life. History, indeed, seems capricious, or why has it signalled out the crimes and sufferings of this woman for such special treatment ? The career of other human beings has been equally remarkable in many ways. The history of the world is full of striking events. We have deeds of heroism, murders, intrigues of love and warfare, examples of beauty and crime apparently as re markable as any we find in the history of this woman, and yet the dust of ages lies thick on them, while to this very day scholars fight for her fame as if, like knights of old, they had sworn to be her champions. Froude asks this question, and partly gives the answer, when he points out that her personal affairs were bound up with the diplomatic relations of the chief nations in Europe. If the destiny of a nation depends upon a love intrigue, that love intrigue acquires an interest not its own. But there is some thing more than this. There is, after all, a certain sort of sentimentalism in his tory ; men are attracted by events and people not in exact proportion to their importance, but because of a certain human interest about them. The story of their lives touches the hearts of their fellows, and so they become famous. It is also to be added that a tale of suffer ing has always a profounder interest than a tale of joy. The greatest poems of the world are all tragedies, and so, too, are all the greatest events. Where is there a story more tragic than that of Mary Stuart, where a mystery so per plexing, a character so interesting, a fate so unequal ? It appeals to us on almost every side, and touches all the varied phases of existence. Even Dr. Dryas dust's chronicles, when they treat of this period of history, assume for a little the vivid colouring of romance. It is a con sequence of the fame of Mary Stuart that she has rendered famous the places where she stayed. A place is even thought worthy of notice if she but passed a night there. As she moved about a great deal in Scotland, the reader will find that we are continually crossing her track. Of course some places are specially connected with her. Of all the memories that crowd to the mind of the educated Scotchman when the name of \"Holyrood\" is mentioned, the most vivid is hers. Loch Leven Castle acquires its sole interest from the fact that here she spent the weary days of her first captivity, and Linlithgow Castle is famous for this above all else, that she was born there. Mary's is not the only tragic story that is connected with Linlithgow. It was while passing through the narrow streets of that town, on the 23rd of January, 1576, that her brother, the Regent Murray, fell by the hand of Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, who thus imagined that he avenged his own wrongs and those of his country. Sir Walter Scott thus tells the story of the crime : \u2014 \"The assassin took his measures with every mark of deliberation. Having learned that the Regent was to pass through Linlithgow on a certain day, he secretly introduced himself into an empty house, belonging to the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, which had in front a wooden balcony looking upon the street."], [161, "LINLITHGOW AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS. 145 Bothwellhaugh hung a black cloth on the wall of the apartment where he lay, that his shadow might not be seen from without, and spread a mattrass on the floor, that the sound of his feet might not be heard from beneath. To secure his escape he fastened a fleet horse in the garden behind the house, and pulled down the lintel-stones from the posts of the garden door, so that he might be able to pass through it on horseback. He also strongly barricaded the front door of the house, which opened to the street of the town. Having thus prepared all for concealment until the deed was done, and for escape afterwards, he armed himself with a loaded carabine, shut himself up in the lonely chamber, and waited the arrival of his victim. right hand. His attendants rushed furiously at the door of the house from which the shot had issued ; but Both wellhaugh's precautions had been so securely taken, that they were unable to force their entrance till he had mounted his good horse and escaped through the garden gate. He was, notwithstanding, pursued so closely, that he had very nearly been taken; but after spur and whip had both failed, he pricked his horse with his dagger, compelled him to take a desperate leap over a ditch, which his pursuers were unable to cross, and thus made his escape.\" Scotland, under the rule of Murray, was just beginning to enjoy something of peace and prosperity when his cruel death plunged it again into confusion. It seemed the doom of all connected with the house of Stuart to injure their unhappy country by their deaths as well as by their lives. But we have tarried long enough in the old grey town Some friend of Murray transmitted to him a hint of the danger which he might incur, in passing through the street of a place in which he was known to have enemies, and advised that he should avoid it by going round on the outside of the town ; or, at least, by riding hastily past the lodging which was more par ticularly suspected, as belonging to the Hamiltons. But the Regent, thinking that the step recommended would have an appearance of timidity, held on his way through the crowded street. As he came opposite the fatal balcony, his horse being somewhat retarded by the number of spectators, Bothwellhaugh had time to take a deliberate aim. He fired the carabine, and the Regent fell, mortally wounded. The ball, after passing through his body, killed the horse of a gentleman who rode on his Where Time in passing in and out, Hath gently set his footstep down. We have dreamed in the shadow of the ruined castle long enough over the memories of other days. We leave the citizens to their lives of humble useful ness and quiet prosperity.

The country about Stir ling was the scene of his exploits, and his glorious, half-mystic capital is the somewhat matter-of-fact Falkirk ot' to-day, famed, as the geography books prosaically say, for its cattle-markets.

It has been the meeting-place, as it were, of Lowlanderand Highlander, of English invader and Scottish patriot, of Jacobite and Hanoverian. The mere mention of the names of some of its localities shows its importance. Stirling, Falkirk, Ban nockburn, are names of moment in Northern history, and we may well believe that it was something more than accident which made it the theatre of so many great events. Recent researches have given it a fresh interest. We all know the famous legend of King Arthur and his heroic knights of the round table, who, though they will never more The knights are dust, Their good swords are rust, Their souls are with the saints we trust. But, indeed, Stirling does not require to supplement its battle history with mythical legend. The same battle his tory is great and important enough already. Let us look at it for a little. And first, then, we have, indeed, a battle of Falkirk fought under no mythical hero, for we must still hold William Wallace to have been a great patriot, though some of our modern historians would make him to be but a sort of robber chieftain, with no aim but his own ad vancement. The ingenious gentlemen who write our histories now-a-days, and who have made such havoc among the most revered heroes of our childhood, may, indeed, in time succeed in resolving him into a solar myth, or something quite as extraordinary. They have already done something of this to William Tell, and now, when we read of that popular creation, we never feel quite comfortable. Like some of the figures in Ossian, he is so unsubstantial that we seem to see the stars shining through him. But Wallace we must as yet hold not guilty of the crime ot non existence. He is not yet condemned, even by the severe tribunal of the new history. It is not necessary to dwell Delight their souls with talk of noble deeds, Within the bowers of Camelot and Usk, yet have an undying existence in the early romance literature of most of the countries of Europe. In our own day, too, Tennyson has revived the theme, and made it peculiarly his own. In the \"Idylls ofthe King\" the half-mythical figure of Arthur is summoned from the spirit world to appear as the embodiment of all that is best and noblest in Christian chivalry, and yet to represent, at the same time, the high-souled gentleman of the nineteenth century. Ihere was,"], [163, "THE BATTLEFIELDS OF STIRLINGSHIRE. 147 long upon the events that led to the battle. We know that as Alexander the Third was riding along the shores of Fife one evening, he was thrown from his horse. Perhaps he was reflecting on some plan for the welfare of his people, for he was a good king ; perhaps he thought on his young granddaughter, his only direct successor; perhaps he was only lulled into careless ease by the beauty of the evening; at any rate, he was careless, and so was thrown from the precipice and killed. No doubt, in the fearful days that fol- lowed, when the present was dark and the future hopeless, men looked back on these times as to a golden age of peace and plenty. For, indeed, Scotland ap- peared lost when the maid of Norway died, and Edward \u2014 in his own way a grand imperial sort of man \u2014 got firm possession of the country, and seemed likely to keep it; but this was not to be, and the man to whom this change was due, was undoubtedly Wallace. But even Wallace could not stand against the enormous power which Edward was able to bring into the field. As has often unfortunately been the case, the nobility of Scotland were not so true to her as the common people. The aristocracy were wearing silken chains at Edward's court, or holding sullenly aloof in their castles; whilst the middle and lower classes were standing round Wallace at the battle of Falkirk \u2014 a defeat indeed, but a defeat more glorious than many a victory. The footmen, we are told, were mar- shalled round Wallace row on row. In their hands they held long spears, against which it seemed impossible for the English cavalry to prevail. Wallace, as he surveyed them with that \" fierce joy which warriors feel \" at the prospect of battle, addressed them in a brief sentence of quaint and sardonic humour, \" I have brought you to the ring, dance gif ye can.\" They did \"dance,\" and to some very considerable purpose, but still unsuccessfully. They were far fewer in number, they were not so well armed, their archers were far inferior, and thoug-h they fought with the courage of desperation, yet the ring was broken and the battle lost, and with it the cause of Scotland's independence for many a long and weary day. In the churchyard they still show the graves of two of the heroes who fell in this battle \u2014 Sir John the Gra ham, and Sir John Stuart, of Bonhill. The first was an intimate friend of Wallace, and perhaps this circumstance caused him to be more noted. Over his grave There is, perhaps, no great event in Scottish history without its legend, and it is said that Thomas the Rhymer had remarked that the 16th of March, 1263, would be memorable for a fearful tem- pest. The day was exceptionally serene and beautiful, and as it was closing they taunted the old wizard with the failure of his prediction. But a messen- ger was seen approaching in hot haste, and soon it was known that Scotland was without a king. \"This,\" said Thomas, \"is the tempest I foretold.\" It was not then the habit to look closely into oracular responses and such like fateful utterances, or perhaps some modern historian, whose spirit had wan- dered into the world some centuries too soon, might have remonstrated with Thomas, and urged that if similar lati- tude of interpretation were allowed, it would be quite easy to prove anything. But, at any r*ite, as Sir Walter Scott remarks, this shows how terrible a calamity the king's death was considered to be. Some simple, yet deeply pathetic lines, \" the oldest specimen of the Scot tish language which is known to remain in existence,\" also belong to the same time. They have been rendered thus : \u2014 When Alexander our king was dead, That Scotland led in luve and le, Awa was wealth of Ale and Brede, Of Wyne and Wax of Gamyn and Glee, Our gold was changyd into lede.

BANNOCKBURN. Was it by a sort of poetical justice that Bannockbum, which retrieved Fal- kirk so completely, was fought in the same district? Well, probably not; poetical, or, indeed, any kind of justice, having but little to do with war. It was simply, we suppose, because, as already noticed, the position of Stirling made it the battle-ground of Scotland. Of course we cannot tell the full story of the battle here. The reader will remember how Bruce, an excommunicated fugitive, yet with all the determined energy of his coun- try and his race, held to his purpose, and, bit by bit, won back the country from the invader; how, when Stirling Castle, the last stronghold of the English, was about to fall, Edward the Second at last roused himself, and prepared to make one desperate effort to regain possession of a country which had seemed so com- pletely his own ; and how that attempt, luckily for both countries, ended in disastrous failure, and Scotland was for ever free. The field of battle is two miles from Stirling, and the position of the rival armies can be easily traced. The Bore stone in which Bruce placed his standard is still pointed out. It is covered with an iron grating to preserve it from the too enthusiastic patriot, the reckless relic-hunter, and that modern Goth\u2014 the Cook's tourist. When the reader visits this famous field we are sure he will be too reverent to tamper with the venerable relic. If he will accept our advice, he will take his station by the side of it, and shut his guide-book.

In 1S77 a statue ofBruce was erected near Stirling Castle. The king is represented as re turning his sword to its scabbard. The victory has now, we may imagine, been won, and he is already preparing to turn his attention to the affairs of his at last liberated kingdom. Few men knew better than he that \"peace hath her victories not less renowned than war.\" On the Abbey Craig, about two miles from Stirling, rises a tower 220 feet in height. This is the Wallace monument. It is commendable that such structures should be erected, but it need scarcely be said that the memorial ot these great men is in the verses ot Scotland's poets and the hearts of Scotland's children. In the highest sense, their country, with all its glorious history and its present prosperity, is their monument. It is not our part to make an invidious distinction ; but something may with propriety be said as to the respective merits of these two patriots.

But with Wallace this, and this alone, was the object of a devotion last ing through a lifetime, and consecrated by a martyr's death. The popular im agination has instinctively realised this. Wallace is emphatically the hero of the people. There is hardly a district in Scotland but has its Wallace's cave or its Wallace's crag. His name has been linked to many a natural object of the land he loved so well. if this battle were lost, Scotland \u2014 for the. time at least \u2014 was lost to England. There w7as, in Edward's dealing with Scotland, a good deal of judicious man\u0153uvring, and this was an example of it. Better to come to terms with rebels than to drive them to desperation. But the mind of Wallace had long been made up, and he scornfully refused the offer of pardon. There was then nothing for it but to advance; but here was the diffi- culty : the Scots were strongly posted. If the English advanced over the bridge they would be exposed, whilst in a most unfavourable position, to the attack of their enemies. The leader hesitated; but he could not hesitate long. Every day brought Wallace new help ; the country would soon be roused were not this incipient rebellion crushed in the bud. Cressingham, the treasurer, a hot-headed ecclesiastic, rather fitted for the battle- field than thepulpit, and who wasevidently inclined \"to prove his doctrine orthodox by apostolic blows and knocks,\" insisted on an immediate advance. In moments of doubt the hot-headed man carries the day. The order was given, and the English army began to defile over the bridge. It seemed that the movement was to be successful ; file after file gained the other side, and began to set them- selves in order. A strange apathy seemed to have seized the Scots. They stood apparently idle; though, indeed, it was with difficulty that they obeyed the stern commands of Wallace to remain perfectly still. And now half the English army was over, and Wallace felt the time was come. The command was given, and at this critical moment the Northern host swept down on the divided foe. The conflict was keen, but brief. In an incredibly short space of time the men on this side of the river were slain, or forced pell-mell into the water. Those on the other bank fled in confusion. The day was lost, and with it the English supremacy, though Falkirk was to re-establish that again tor a brier There are many other battlefields in Stirling, and within a short distance of Bannockbum there is one as disgraceful as that is famous. We refer to Sauchie burn, where James the Third met his rebellious subjects in open conflict. The story goes that the king, struck with a sudden panic, fled from the field. He was thrown from his horse, and carried to a mill, where he recovered his senses. He believed himself to be dying, and faintly asked for a priest. The people of the house, perhaps with less deference than a monarch is used to, asked who he was. With a weak, yet pathetic assump tion of dignity, he replied, \"I was your king this morning.\" A man who pro fessed to be a priest was brought to shrive the king. But he stabbed him to the heart. The murderer sled, and it was never accurately known who he was. Another battle fought near here, ought, in chronological order, to have been taken earlier. This was the battle of Stirling, which occurred in 1297, where Wallace defeated John De Warrene, the English governor. The river Forth flows by Stirling. At that time a wooden bridge crossed it. The English were on one bank, the Scotch on the other. Both armies were under good generals, and the English commander, prudent as well as brave, tried first to see what negotia tion would do. The country, as yet, was comparatively quiet; but he knew that"], [167, "THE BATTLEFIELDS OF STIRLINGSHIRE. 151 period, for \"the end was not yet.\" Cressingham led the van, and atoned for his rashness with his death. The Scots are said to have flayed his skin, and used it as saddle-girths; though, as Sir Walter Scott justly remarks, it could not have been very fit for this purpose. This somewhat brutal act, taken with the flight of the part of the army on the other bank, suggests a reflection. We see how it came to be that both the victories and defeats of those days were so decisive. The conquered were treated by the conquerors with such terrible cruelty, that when some decisive incident seemed to have once turned the scale, a panic was almost invariably spread through the army. A trifling incident thus served to settle a victory. Now-a days, a soldier is so much of a machine that he seems simply to go through certain evolutions, in which there is no opportunity for the display of personal bravery or cowardice. He does not know what is going on in other parts of the field, and has no real knowledge, till all be over, whether the day has been lost or won. Then the armies were com paratively small. The whole business was decided under a clear light, and the great majority of the army saw every thing that occurred. A deed of personal prowess then had much more moral effect than it has now. Bannockbum was half decided by the blow that crushed De Bohun's skull. There was much more opportunity at that time for the display of personal prowess. The force of the blow from a battle-axe depends upon the strength of the arm that wields it; the force of a rifle-bullet hardly depends even upon the skill of him that shoots \u2014 for but little skill is required in firing among a mass of men \u2014 and upon strength not at all. Modern warfare is much more a game of skill than brute force. There is all the differ ence between a battle now and a battle then, that there is between a game of chess _and a football match \u2014 though both require skill, yet one requires it in a much greater degree than the other. The hero of the time of which we are writing required then to be powerful both in body and mind. It is this which gives such a charm to the great warriors of our early annals. They all had a certain perfection of manhood about them. The strong and active bodily frame, the capable and directing mind, were, by the very neces sity of the case, alike present in them. Thus, with all their faults and errors, these gentlemen of nature move nobly over the stage of our history. Another battle in Stirling brings before us yet another hero not less interesting, though in him the elements were \" less kindly mixed\" than in his predecessors. We refer, of course, to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and his defeat of the English forces under General Hawley, near Falkirk, on the 16th of January, 1746. The whole affair was of rather a mixed nature. The Hanoverian cavalry were defeated, and fled, whilst the infantry were successful in repulsing the insurgent attack. \"The battle was now in a singular state, both armies [accord ing to Mr. Home's account] were in flight at the same time. Hawley's cavalry, and most of the infantry, except ing those on the extreme right, had been completely thrown into confusion and routed, but the three regiments which continued fighting had a decided advan tage over the Prince's left, and many Highlanders fled under the impression that the day was lost. The advantage, upon the whole, was undoubtedly with Charles Edward; but, from the want of discipline among the troops he com manded, and the extreme severity of the tempest which had broken over the con tending forces, it became difficult even to learn the extent of the field of battle, and impossible to follow it.\" It was, in fact, a purposeless victory, and though it served to throw a sort of dying splendour over a lost cause, it only lengthened out a"], [168, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 152 Then there would have been less rage on the part of the conquerors, fewer defeats to avenge, and so more modera tion in the use of the victory. The repu tation of the Hanoverians would have stood higher, and their fame clearer. useless conflict, which, when it really did close, left the defeated more helpless, and the final conquerors more exasperated than would otherwise have been the case. Better for all parties had the inevitable Culloden been anticipated at Falkirk. Charles Edward Stewart and Mis Race TheGude Man of Ballangeich and J^oetry \u2014 George Buchanan. O doubt the reader pears on the historical stage as a youth, he leaves it as such, and as such he is permanently present to our imagination. In him there are two distinct lines of interest: that connected with the Stewart family, and that personal interest we have noted. And what a profound interest that first is ! Every good and every ill of fate. A line stretching back till it is lost in dim antiquity \u2014 the com mand of the empire on which the sun never sets, the devotion of thousands of gallant hearts throughout succeeding generations, and the possession of many noble and endearing qualities, were not sufficient to save the unfortunate race from a series of calamities to parallel which we must go not to history, but to romance: to stories like those of \"Thebes and Pelops line, and the tale of Troy divine.\" True, indeed, the misfortunes of the Stewarts were very much through their own fault, but this only makes the devotion of so many noble men to their cause more touching, and invests their whole history with a deeper tragic interest. Besides, this was not always the case; the death of so many of the earlier members of the race was due to the evil tendencies around them. And the darkest circumstance in their history was that the best and the most gifted is of opinion that he has had enough of \" war's alarums \" for some time, and it will be a relief to turn to some of the gentler aspects of Scottish life, which our subject at this point may be made to present. Still, it is difficult to pass away at once from Charles Edward ; though, as he has met us already, so he will meet us again and again in our wandering. He is one of the typical figures of Scottish history. We may know, as a matter of fact, that he spent the rest of his days in ignoble ease, and we are surely all convinced that it is well indeed that the cause which he represented did not succeed ; but who can help feeling sympathy with him and his gallant followers ? His personality has a cer tain charmed life about it. Just as those who die as children are always figured by us as children in the spirit world, so he died young historically, and even on the old page of history is ever the young Chevalier. We may know that Helen of Troy must have grown an old woman, but we never think ol her as such, and so with Prince Charles Edward ; he ap-"], [169, "CHARLES EDWARD STEWART AND HIS RACE. 153 seemed doomed to the most utter ruin. Among many examples of this there is one which may be noted as specially con nected with Stirling, and that is James V., who, as well as his ancestor James IV., was born in the castle, and whose death of a broken heart we have already alluded to. He succeeded to the throne when under two years of age, and was carefully educated by Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, and John Bellenden, the historian, and ruled rigorously and well till the rapid series of misfortunes that culminated at Solway Moss aged and killed him before his time. Near the castle of Stirling there is a walk called Ballangeich (by the winding way), and James, who, like the Caliph Haroun Alraschid, was in the habit of wander ing in disguise among his subjects, partly from a desire to see how his officers administered justice, partly from mere love of sport or adventure, adopted whilst thus travelling incognito the name ofthe Gude Man of Ballangeich. Accord ing to all accounts he met with a re markable number of adventures of all kinds, and these have been handed down to us in traditional story and traditional song. He was himself a poet, and one of the best songs of the period is ascribed with much probability to him. It is called the Gaberlunzie (namely, beggar) Man, and is a sort of comical reverse of the well-known legend of King Cophetua, for whilst that monarch married a beggar-maid \" more beautiful than day,\" this represents the love of one who, though not a princess, w7as at any rate a substantial farmer's daughter, for a beggar man. If, however, the song is autobiographical, and the gaber lunzie was the king in disguise, then the young lady is to be congratulated on the goodness of her taste. At any rate here is the song, and so the reader may judge for himself, for though itis written in somewhat quaint language, yet it is quite intelligible, and the very quaintness gives it additional force: \u2014 THE GABERLUNZIE MAN. The pawky auld carle came o'er the lee, Wi' many good e'ens and days to me, Saying, Goodwife, for your courtesie, Will you lodge a silly poor man ?

He was afterwards trans ferred to a monastery, where he wrote his celebrated Latin version of the Psalms. On returning to his native country he was made Principal of St. Leonard's College in the University of St. Andrew's. It is also worthy of notice that, \" though a layman, he was in June, 1567, on account of his great abilities and extraordinary learning, elected Moderator of the \u201e General Assembly.\" Some rade upo' horse, some ran a-sit, The wife was wud, and out o' her wit, She could na gang, nor yet cou'd she sit, But she curs'd ay, and she bann'd.

He certainly succeeded in putting a good deal of knowledge into his pupil's head, though, as he himself confessed, the result was not altogether satisfactory, but, as he said, \" He had made him a pedant because he could make nothing else of him.\" James in after years took his revenge by denouncing Buchanan's History of Scotland, which was odious to him on account of its liberal opinions. He died in 1582, and was buried in the Greyfriars' churchyard at Edinburgh. His more fervent admirers have claimed for him that he wrote Latin better than the classical writers themselves. As classical Latin is simply the writings of After the gaberlunzie man. My dear, quo' he, ye're yet o'er young, And hae na learn'd the beggar's tongue, To follow me frae town to town, And carry the gaberlunzie on.

I'll bow my leg, and crook my knee, And draw a black clout o'er my ee ; A cripple or blind they will ca' me, While we shall be merry and sing. The transition from a roving king who was a poet to a roving king's tutor who was also a poet seems a natural enough one, and as we are roaming about Stirlingshire it is well to remember that in the village of Kiltearn, in February, 1506, the famous George Buchanan first saw the light. Buchanan is, perhaps, the most distinguished specimen of the Scot abroad, and to give an account of his wanderings and ad ventures would fill a volume. He is said to have studied at places of such very various degrees of importance as Dunfermline, St. Andrew's, and Paris. His freedom of writing early got him into mischief, for, having attacked the clergy in a satirical poem, he was obliged in consequence to leave his native land, and betake himself to the continent. For some time he acted as tutor to Montaigne, and then, having again got these very authors, the compliment is an obvious bull. But of his learning there cannot be a doubt. Even Dr. Johnson was forced for once to admire Scotch scholarship, though he somewhat ungraciously conveyed a compliment to Buchanan at the expense of his native land. \" He was, sir, the only man of genius his country ever; produced!\" The student of English literature novv a-days takes a somewhat different view, and is inclined to wish that Buchanan had given less of his great powers 10 writing Latin, and more to writing English. Here, however, is a specimen of his work \u2014 a poem \" translated from the Latin of Buchanan by Robert Hogg, a nephew of the Ettrick Shepherd\" :"], [171, "STIRLING AND ITS CASTLE. 155 Such fruitful warmths perpetual rest On the fair islands ofthe blest \u2014 Those plains where fell disease's moan And frail old age are both unknown.

E have said that Scottish history is very much the tary station, and it still towers over the landscape which it can no longer profess to guard. The chief points of interest in it are the quaintly decorated palace to the south ; the Douglas room, so called from the assassination of William, eighth Earl of Douglas, by James II. ; on the north-west, and adjoining it, the once richly-adorned Chapel Royal, now degraded to a store-room ; and touching this, the Parliament House built by James III. It is not architecturally that the old rock possesses its deepest interest. It is in its situation and its history. The view from the battlements is hardly to be surpassed by any in Scotland. At o*jr feet, in many a winding and devious way, flow the silvery waters of the Forth through a rich country, where wood and hill and cultivated plain all blend into one mass of beauty. Away to the north rise line upon line the masses ofthe Highland hills. All round us the hills and mountains bound the prospect, and grand old Celtic names pass \"like a glorious roll of drums \" through the mind as we gaze. Tnere is Ben Lomond history of one or two towns, and it may be said that the history of these towns is the history of their castles. Take away all the events connected with Stir ling Castle and Edinburgh Castle from Northern annals, and what a gap you make ! The origin of this same castle of Stirling is lost in antiquity. It is easy to conjecture, however, that such a promi nent place was the very situation that would be chosen for a fortress, and then a town would in time gather slowly round it, as the town of Edinburgh did round its castle. The progress of towns then was not as now. At present the people come first, and then churches and fortifications are built. But long ago a population grew up round the church and the fortress. Stirling Castle is still used as a mili-"], [172, "156 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. and Ben A'an, and Ben Ledi, and the peaks of Benvoirlich, and Uam-var, and the great masses of the Ochil and Campsie hills. No wonder the old poet, the famous Lord Lyon, King-at-Arms, felt regret at leaving it, as he tells us in the quaint lines \u2014 murder of the Regent Murray. Leav ing this Sad and fatal mound That oft hast heard the death axe sound, As on the noblest of the land Fell the stern headsman's bloody hand, \u2014 we must note the \" Round Table \" and the \" Valley,\" where of old jousts and tournaments and all sorts of knightly sports were held. The mention of the round table puts one naturally in mind of the Arthurian tradition, and it is in teresting to note that some of the early Scottish writers have called Stirling Castle Snowdoun from some supposed legendary connection with the half mythical King Arthur. The shire also possesses, or rather possessed, the ex traordinary structure called Arthur's Oven. Antiquaries report of it that \" it was a round building open at the top like the Pantheon of Rome, but of tar inferior workmanship and dimensions. Its height was 22 feet, and its diameter in the inside 19^ feet. In the time of Boece, its area within was surrounded by stone seats, and on the south there was an altar. Buchanan calls it the Boundary Temple, thus adopting the opinions of those antiquaries who hold that it was a temple erected to the god Terminus by Agricola, on his fixing here the boundaries of the Roman empire.\" A barbarous proprietor demolished this interesting relic many years ago, and built a water-mill with its materials. The river Carron forthwith rose in flood and carried the prosaic structure away, but whether this was a mere accidental coincidence or connected as cause and effect, we do not presume to say. Let us back to Stirling, however, from which we have digressed for a moment. The castle is specially rich in memories of four of the Scottish sovereigns. James IV. was born here, James V. was crowned here, and so was his successor, the unfortunate Mary. Froude has drawn a brilliant picture of the progress Adieu, fair Snaw-doun, with thy towers high, Thy Chapel-royal, park, and table round ; May, June, and July, would I dwell in thee Were I a man to hear the birdis sing, Whilk doth again thy royal rock re bound. As we gaze at the scenery, perhaps our fancy wanders into the past, and before the mind'seye there passesa longproces sion of king and warriors, and priests and armies, for the most famous spots of Scottish history are in sight. Yonder mount is Hurlyhacket, from whence, as our poet tells us, the young King James V. used to slide down. It has a far darker memory, however. It is the Tower Hill of Scotland, as its name of the \"heading hill\" implies. Here Murdoch, Duke of Albany, and Regent of Scot land, along with his two sons, and the old Earl of Lennox, were put to death under James I., for having abused the King's authority. On this same hill the murderers of that same king, Robert Stewart, the Earl of Athole, Sir Robert Grahame, and others, were put to death with fearful tortures. Grahame, in special, who had the chief part in the murder, \" spoke in defence of it to the last. He had a right to slay the Ring, he said, for he had renounced his allegiance and declared war against him, and he expressed his belief that his memory would be honoured for putting to death so cruel a tyrant. He was tor tured in the most dreadful manner be fore his final execution, and whilst he was yet living his son was slain before his eyes.\" Near here was executed Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrew's, Primate of Scotland, accused of complicity in the"], [173, "STIRLING AND ITS CASTLE. 157 ancient Church. This was the special church selected for the coronation of James VI. It owes its preservation to the fact that it was found easily possible to make it serviceable for the new re ligion when that gained the upper hand. Indeed, like St. Giles's at Edinburgh, it \" contrived a double debt to pay,\" and is divided into two churches. Here, as elsewhere, the changes required were not carried out with such care as ab solutely to preserve the original struc ture; but one is inclined rather to be thankful for what is left, than vainly to of Anne Boleyn through the streets of London as the wife of Henry VIII., and then contrasted it with the dismal pageant of a succeeding day, which was to end her miserable life. A still more striking picture might be drawn between the solemn coronation of Mary in the presence of the three estates of the realm, and with the greatest possible pomp, in this her northern fortress, and her execution in the southern castle. But, indeed, the whole history ofthe unfortu nate queen is full of these abrupt con trasts. regret what is gone. \"Revolutions are not made with rose-water,\" it has been well said, and when we consider tho many advantages which the Reforma tion brought, we must, like sensible men, be reconciled to one or two ofthe minor evils which accompanied it.

Inconsiderate people, whilst quietly accepting the good, have com plained ofthe evil; but we must re- As we have already mentioned the subject of James VI.'s education, it only remains to add that it was in these walls that he received his lessons and his castigations from the learned Buchanan. There are some monuments of interest in the town of Stirling itself which will repay a visit. The Greyfriars' Church was built by James V., and is known in history as the scene of one or two famous events. Here the Earl of Arran, governor of the kingdom, in 1543. pub licly abjured the reformed faith, and was received back into the bosom of the"], [174, "158 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. member that the two were, to some extent, inseparable. Still, there was some evil mixed with the great good of the Reformation. For one thing, it made Scotland more provincial. She was cut off from the great community of Catholic nations, and it is owing to this that we find so few of the softer graces of life in the centuries that followed. Most wonderful was the almost complete decay in taste. The nation seemed absolutely to have lost all sense of the beautiful. When we gaze at a structure like Roslin Chapel, we seem to be lost in a dream of beauty, and we wonder how it was that men of the same country could be found in one age so refined, in another age so rude. The ungainly barns in which the public worship of Scotland was carried on for the centuries that succeeded the Reformation are scarcely so repellent as the mutilated churches of the old faith, rudely adapted to serve for another, a simpler, and a better, and yet a far less beautiful and tasteful ritual. They strike the beholder like some beautiful face, disfigured with an unsightly scar. Yet there is a good deal to be said in extenuation even of the rough rabble, who, with the brutal jest that the crows would not \" big \" again were their nests destroyed, gave the pious toil of centuries to the flames.

It was not built by Argyle, however, but by anotner noble man, equally interesting, thougn not so famous. This was William Alexander, first Earl of Stirling, who was born at Menstrie, near Stirling, in 15S0. He was another type of the roving Scot, was always on shewing, and yet nad ever a remembrance of and passionate affection for his native land. As a young man he travelled on the continent witn Argyle, and afterwards was one of the band of Scotchmen who, not always to King James's delight, followed that monarch southward. Scholar and poet like the King himself, he vvas a favourite at court, and filled several offices of con siderable importance. He afterwards went as lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia, but the colony did not succeed well, and Alexander, who, though a poet, had as keen an eye for business as the rest of his countrymen, disposed of his rights there to the French, \" for a matter of sive or six thousand pounds English money.\" On his return home he filled various high state offices in Scotland, and seven years before his death, which took place in 1640, he was created Earl of Stirling.

Drummond of Hawthornden, who called him \" that most excellent spirit and rarest gem of our North,\" and Drayton, author of \"Polyolbion,\" wrote highly eulogistic verses in his honour. But the most interesting fact about him is a sup posed connection with Shakspeare, who is believed, on no very sure grounds, we confess, to have gone to Scotland to pay him a visit. A passage in one of Stirling's poems, ending We find, by proof, that into every age In Ph\u0153bus' art some glistering star did shine, Who, worthy scholars to the Muses sage, Fulfill'd their countries with their works divine.

The grand dignity of the Tudor sovereigns, the royal bearing of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, were but ill represented in onewhoseeverymovement conveyed a sense of the ridiculous. The contrast between him and his mother was still more striking. They hardly, indeed, seemed to belong to the same breed. Mary might be crafty and criminal, but there was always about her a certain grandeur, that spoke of one \"born to the purple.\" She was never cowardly or ungrateful, and it must be confessed her son was both. But sen that tyme is sic a precious thing I wad we sould bestow it into that, Which were most pleasour to our heavenly king Flee ydilteth, which is the greatest lat Bot, sen that death to all is destenat Let us employ that tyme that God hath send us, In doing weill, that good men may commend us. To this we shall just add a couple of verses from the translation of the Psalms which James (perhaps in hopeless rivalry of Buchanan!) wrote and Stirling re vised: \u2014 \u25a0 O thou who from thy palace oft Ietts fall (For to refresh the hills) thy blessed raine : Who with thy works maintains the earth and all : Who maks to grow the herbs and grass to gaine, she herbs for foode to man, grass dois remaine On the other hand she was implacable and unforgetting, he was only too easily pacified, and suffered his courtiers to praise the murder of his mother to his face. He was weak and infirm of purpose, whilst she could follow out great designs through long years, constant to them alike in triumph and defeat. He hardly ever seemed to know his own mind, and was easily wheedled from the most cherished of his schemes. And yet we repeat injustice has been done to a nature essentially kindly and well-mean ing. His mother has obtained too great favour at the hands of the historians, and by some strange prin ciple of compensation her son has been made to pay the penalty of it. By far the best picture of him is that given in the \"Fortunes of Nigel,\" and that pic ture, whilst true to history, can by no means be pronounced unfavourable. At any rate it is favourable when com pared with that usually drawn of him. His mental physiognomy is perhaps worthy of a deeper study than any to which it has been hitherto subjected, for it belongs to that small yet distinct type of Scots men whose characters are chiefly re markable in that they are on most points directly the opposite of the national characteristics. James's bring ing up will serve to account for very much of this. No doubt he preferred For food to horse and cattel of all kynde. Thou causeth them not pull at it in vaine, But be thair food, such is thy will and mynde. Who dois rejoyse the hart of man with wyne, And who with oyle his face maks cleir and bright, And who with foode his stomack strengthnes syne, Who nourishes the very treis aright. The cedars evin of Liban tall and wight He planted hath, where birds do bigg their nest. He made the sirr trees of a woundrous hight, Where storks dois mak their dwelling-place, and rest. We think that these extracts go to prove that James VI. has been some what hardly treated by succeeding generations. His writings show that after all he was something more than a mere pedant \u2014 that he not only had knowledge, but also possessed the power to use it. He was by no means a bad-hearted man either. He seems to have been rather given to senti mentalism, indeed. And yet few men have been better abused than the British Solomon. There was so little dignity in him, that, like a dwarf in giant's armour, there is always a sense of the ludicrous when we think of him upon the British throne. This accounts for much.

The luxury and magnificence, the soft adulation andflattering regard with which his later years were surrounded, were certainly in striking contrast to the com parative poetry of Stirling and the stern precepts of Buchanan. But we must return again to modern life. Money,\" published at Edinburgh about the beginning of the eighteenth century. talks about the poverty of Scotland and the laziness of her inhabitants as facts that admitted of no dispute. There was, as he justly remarked, but little manu facturing business, and so little induce ment for the people to work hard. It was only in later years, when the possi bilities of wealth that the rich mineral fields between Edinburgh and Glasgow opened up were seen and realised, that this reproach was quite cast off. From that time wages began to rise, the towns to increase, the houses and food and dress of the people to get better, and a gene ral air of well-to-do-ness to diffuse itself over the land. Even those who seemed furthest away shared in the great pros perity. We travelled some time ago in a not very frequented part of Perthshire, and passed on the way a fairly built, substantial-looking village, about as different from the typical \"Clachan of Aberfoyle\" as could well be imagined. The people on the coach began to talk about it, and the driver, an elderly man, told us that he well remembered the day when there was not a glass window in the abominable huts which then did duty for houses. As he justly remarked, it was the folk from Glasgow that did it ! No doubt there were many causes which produced this; but ofthe chief of these, the mineral industries of Falkirk and Carron may fairly be taken as the type. Neither a coal-pit nor an iron mine are picturesque objects; but neither loch nor glen seem particu- larly to have been admired till these same useful minerals had given people wealth, and procured them, through that wealth, leisure sufficient to admire the sterner aspects of nature. With which sensible if commonplace observation, we shall conclude the subject, and move on to other interest- ing scenes. The traveller passing through the eastern part of the county of Stirling in the swift night express seems to be in the midst of a perpetual illumination, though of rather a diabolical character. All along the horizon strange lights flash to the sky, and cast a glare on sleeping town and dark moorland. Fiery pillars move all around him, and these in the daytime are great masses of dark cloud and smoke. He is in a part of the chief iron district of Scotland, and what he sees, and unfortunately feels, is the flame and smoke from a hundred fur naces, whose \"infernal monotony of ceaseless activity,\" to borrow Carlyle's phrase, he is probably not inclined Highly to commend. And yet this is the cnief agency that has made Scotland what she now is. If one turns up the account of the Tullyveolan village at the beginning of \"Waverley,\" or the rural scenes in the \" Cottagers of Glenburnie,\" one gets a notion of the inevitable discomfort and squalid condition in which the common people, not so very long ago, existed. Scot land used to be very much like the heroine described in the song as \" the penniless lass wi' the long pedigree \"\u2014 she had a great and noble history ; but she had little or nothing of substantial prosperity. Nay, her people were ac counted quite careless as to mercantile matters, and very much disinclined to steady industry.

There is some doubt as to the exact incident to which the ballad refers ; but it would seem to be told of the escort sent to convey Margaret \u2014 afterwards called the Maid of Norway \u2014 to that country, to whose king she was betrothed. This vague ness is, it seems to us, rather an advan tage ; like the cobwebs on a bin of old wine, it gives a flavour of antiquity to a story embedded in the cobwebs of time; \u2014 To send us out at this time o' the year, To sail upon the sea ? \" \" Be 't wind or weet, be 't hail or sleet, Our ship maun sail the faem !

When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud, And gurly grew the sea. The objects for which Dunfermline is interesting, are chiefly these: the castle, of which hardly a fragment remains, the palace, and the abbey. It was in the first of these that we must suppose the king to have been carousing, when, quite in the delightfully inconsequent \" happy thought \" vein of the old ballad, it occurred to him to send away Sir Patrick on his dangerous voyage. It was the favourite residence of Malcolm Canmore, or Malcolm of the big head \u2014 a prince who, though ignorant and vio lent, was not without many noble traits of character. If he was unlearned it was rather his misfortune than his fault, as we shall see. During his reign the Norman Conquest took place, and a large number of exiles fled northward. A'.-nong these was Edgar Etheling and his sister Margaret. According to Bu chanan, these royal fugitives had pre pared a retreat to Hungary, but they were driven on to the coast of Scotland. At any rate, they somehow or other gut to court, where they were received with the most open-minded generosity. To the king \u2014 rough and wild as he of neces sity was \u2014 the coming of the exiles was something like a revelation from another world. Margaret had that rare, spiritual beauty which, exhibited in a far less degree, had charmed men in Edward the Confessor. Her blue eyes, golden hair, and graceful form, still more the courtesy of manner that with her was no mere mask, but the fit expression of a pure and gentle soul, made a profound impression on Malcolm. He loved her, nay, worshipped her, with all the deep, passionate devotion of his dark and gloomy Celtic nature. They were mar ried, and the charm of her presence seemed still to grow on the king, and influence, moreover, the whole body of the people. In the fashion of those days, The ankers brak, and the top-masts lap, It was sic a deidly storm ; And the waves cam over the broken ship Till a' her sides were torn. \" O whaur will I get a gude sailor, Will tak the helm in hand Till I get up to the tall top-mast, To see if I can spy land. \" O here am I, a sailor gude To tak the helm in hand Till ye get up to the tall top-mast\u2014 But 1 fear ye'll ne'er spy land.\" He hadna gane a step, a step, A step but barely ane, When a bout flew out o' the gude ship's side, And the saut sea it cam in. \" Gae, fetch a wab o' the silken claith, Anither o' the twine, And wap them into our gude ship's side, And let na the sea come in.\" They fetch'd a wab o' the silken claith, Anither o' the twine, And they wapp'd them into the gude ship's siile, But aye the sea cam in. \" Ye'll pick her weel, an' span her weel, And mak her hale an' soun',\" But ere he had the words weel spoke The bonnie ship was doun.

Poor indeed are the forms which cannot be animated and turned to good account by the pure spirit. Her influence gradually softened and refined the life of the Scottish court till it attained to a higher civilisation. Under her fostering care the Church was constituted, and schools and learning flourished. Her husband aided, some times blindly, but always with the same profound faith. A touching story is told of his reverence for learning and religion. He could neither read nor write. His hands had held the sword too long ever to hold the pen ; and to his eyes the mystic scrolls called books never took definite meaning. But truer of heart than most unlearned men, he believed where he could not understand. His wife's books of prayer and devotion were gorgeously illuminated, at his command, by the hands of cunning artists. He often took them up and gazed long at the strange lines which told him no story, and yet which, somehow, was mixed with the love he bore to his God and his wife. The bystanders noted that he reverently kissed the books before he laid them down. A noble and fearless man, too, was this same Canmore. Buchanan tells us that he had many troubles to contend with when he came to rule. Luthlac, son of Macbeth, \"who was surnamed Fatuous, from his want of wit,\" was crowned at Scone, and sup ported by a large number of adherents. Malcolm met him and his foes \"in the valley Bag-ian,\" anddefeated them. Luth lac fell in the battle, and the conqueror, with royal generosity, had him laid in the royal sepulchre in holy Iona, for he remembered that he was of the royal race. At last, when all seemed peaceful, a dangerous conspiracy was entered into against the throne. A powerful chief headed it, but just before the out break the whole matter was discovered to the king. The chief of the conspiracy was then at court ; but Malcolm did not seize him. He sent for him, \"who sus pected nothing of the business, and, after much familiar discourse, led him aside into a lonely valley, commanding his followers to stay behind. There he upbraided him with the former benefits bestowed on him, and declared to him the plot he had contrived against his life; adding, further, 'If thou hast courage enough, why dost thou not now set upon me, seeing that we are both armed, that so thou may'st obtain thy desire by valour, and not by treachery ? ' The plotter, being amazed at this sudden discovery, fell down on his knees and asked pardon of the king, who, being a merciful as well as a valiant prince, easily forgave him.\" Under the reign of Malcolm, Scotland underwent a complete transformation, which was signalised by his partial desertion of his old castle of Dunferm line, and his partial transferrence of the seat of Government to Edinburgh \u2014 from a Celtic to a Saxon city. Henceforward a Saxon dialect \u2014 the Lowland Scotch \u2014 became the language of the court; the royal burying-place was removed from Iona to Dunfermline, and the Church was more and more confined to the Roman model. The Celts then and the Celts of to-day may, perhaps, have regretted the change ; but it cannot be denied that it placed the civilisation of Scotland on a higher and truer basis, and gave a firmness and purpose to the national life which it never afterwards quite lost. The Celt might console himself with the reflection that whatever he lost, the royal line, at least, was his, and he came, at any rate, as a conqueror. The change was ultimately of vast importance in British history. Had the Lothians re mained part of Northumbria, and been finally incorporated with the English kingdom, there is little doubt that the Highlands could not long have held out against the mass of Southern power. Another Ireland might, perhaps, have cramped the Britain of to-day."], [182, "166 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. Malcolm Canmore fell during one of those interminable forays which the Scottish kings were always making into England. He died a warrior's death at the head of his army. His queen was lying on a sick-bed when her second son, who had escaped from the battle, approached. \" How fares it,\" said the expiring queen, \"with your father and with your brother Edward ? \" The prince answered nothing. \" I conjure you,\" she implored, \" by the Holy Rood, and by the duty you owe me, to tell me the truth.\" \" Your husband and your son are both slain,\" was the sad answer. \" Then God's will be done,\" said the queen, now mortally hurt. The Scots had brought Malcolm's body from the battle-field, and he, along with his queen \u2014 \" for in death they were not divi ded \"\u25a0 \u2014 were laid together in the church which he himself had founded. \"A large slab of coarse blue marble\" still marks the spot where they rest. Even at this distance of time their lives have a pro found interest for us. They stand to gether at the fountain stream of our history as we now conceive it. Their reigns are the first beginning of modern Scotland. Hand-in-hand they seem to emerge from the mists of the Northern hills, and through all the intervening centuries seem joined to us by many bonds of common interest. It is well for us that such noble figures mark the first years of the new kingdom. den of thieves, by holding their rebel lious Parliaments there.' The cells thus spared, and the principal part of the church, were destroyed at the Reforma tion. The remains of the abbey are extensive and magnificent ; the fratery, in particular, with its beautiful window, is extremely striking; adjacent to it is the Abbot's house. The old church, part of which is used for parochial ser vice,' is supported by massive pillars twenty feet high, and thirteen and a half in circumference, ribbed spirally, and two of them marked with zigzag lines. In the area of the church are six flat stones, each nine feet in length, under which as many kings are said to lie buried. On digging a grave a good many years ago, there was discovered a stone coffin, six feet in length, containing human bones ; and, at the same time, there were found fragments of a marble monument, finely carved and gilt.\" In the centre of where the new church now stands is the grave of Robert the Bruce, who died at Cardross in 1329. His heart was buried at Melrose Abbey, and the story of this separation may be told somewhat as follows : \u2014 Bruce, on his death-bed, first gave explicit direc tions as to the affairs of his kingdom, and bethought him, in the second place, of his own concerns. He remembered with regret his grievous sacrilege in the murder of the Red Comyn in a church, and he confessed that he had long cherished a desire to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and there fight against the Turks for the possession of the Holy Sepulchre. Affairs of state, a kingdom only newly constituted, a watchful enemy on the frontier had pre vented this. He had preferred his country's welfare to his own. He knew that there was but one other journey that he could now ever take, and that was to another world, and so he begged the Lord James Douglas \u2014 the man who had stood by him in a hundred fights, and of whose fidelity in weal and woe he was The few stones that remain of their early dwelling, and the slab that marks their last resting-place, will recall to the observer the memory of their fair and noble lives, and their heroic deaths. Of this priory, which was afterwards raised to an abbey, we are told \" It was bestowed on monks of the Benedictine order, brought from Canterbury, and splendidly endowed. In 1303, Edward I. burned down this magnificent fabric, excepting the church and cells; 'because,' says Matthew of Westminster, [ the Scots had converted the house of the Lord into a"], [183, "DUNFERMLLNE TOUN. 167 well assured, to carry his heart to Palestine, and lay it in the Holy Sepulchre. The Bruce died, and his heart was removed from the bod)7, embalmed, and placed in a silver casket, carrying which the Douglas and a chosen band of the Scottish youth set forth. All went well till they came to Spain, where they were entertained at the court of Alphonso, the ninth king of Castile. Alphonso was then in deadly conflict with the Saracens, and he begged the assistance of his visitors. According to Buchanan, Douglas reflected \" that it mattered not in what place he assisted the cause of Christianity;\" but, indeed, the eagerness with which he acceded to King Alphonso's request is not without a slight touch of the comical. Like the dog of the story, the good Sir James \"just never could get enuch o' fechting,\" and the present occasion was far too providential to be despised. Well, there was a good deal of fighting going, and of this the Scottish noble had his full share, but he found his opponents very different metal from the stubborn English soldiers with whom he had fought all his life. The Moors seemed men of an inferior race altogether, and easily to be crushed. Thus he made the common mistake of despising his foes, and the matter had a brief and tragic close. He pursued a band one day too far, till he found himself almost alone. His foes turned on him, and in a few moments he was surrounded with an overwhelming multitude. Retreat was not possible; nor was it his custom. In that moment he thought of the precious relic com mitted to his care. He ever carried with him the silver casket that contained the heart of the Bruce. This he now lowered from the chain to which it was attached, and adjured the cold dust to command the battle. \" Pass first in fight as thou wert wont to do, and Douglas will follow thee or die.\" So speaking, he threw the casket among the foe, and followed it headlong. His dead body- was found lying over the heart. In this disastrous skirmish the chief members of the little band had fallen, and the remainder were not inclined to continue their journey. They brought back the heart of the Bruce and the bones of the Douglas to their native- land, where the first, as we have noted, was interred in Melrose Abbey. Centuries passed on, and, almost within our own time, it was determined to rebuild or repair the church at Dunfermline, which was then in a ruinous condition. No one knew the grave of the Bruce; but in digging for the purposes of the repair near the spot where it was thought he had been laid, the workmen came upon a skeleton of extraordinary size. Near it were found fragments of the stately marble monu ment which had once adorned the sepul chre of the greatest of the Scottish kings. The skeleton was undoubtedly his, for there still adhered to it fragments of the cloth of gold which, according to tra ditionary report, had formed his shroud, and the \" breastbone appeared to have been sawn through inorderto take outthe heart. So orders were sen t from the King' s Court of Exchequer to guard the bones carefully, until a new tomb should be prepared, into which they were laid with profound respect. A great many gen tlemen and ladies attended, and almost all the common people in the neighbour hood; and as the church could not hold half the numbers, the people were allowed to pass through it, one after another, that each one, the poorest as well as the richest, might see all that remained of the great King Robert Bruce, who restored the Scottish mon archy. Many people shed tears; for there was the wasted skull, which once was the head that thought so wisely and boldly for his country's deliverance; and there was the dry bone, which had once been the sturdy arm that killed Sir Henry de Bohun, between the two armies, at a single blow, on the evening before the battle of Bannockbum.\""], [184, "168 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. This romantic incident of the death of the good Sir James is a striking example of the influence of what we may call the sentimental in history. As Sir Walter Scott justly remarks, Douglas was wanted at home much more than he could possibly be in the Holy Land, and no doubt this was fully recognised at the time. Still, as we see, he set out on this distant and perilous voyage, and not only that, but the Bruce's last request shows that he, too, was only restrained from an expedition to the Holy Land by an iron chain of circumstances which had something of the irresistible force of necessity. with a certain inconsistency, the imagina tion lingers. The heart approves what the reason condemns.. Perhaps incidents of this sort had something to do with the passionate devotion with which, durino* the latter part of his reign, he was re garded. Buchanan has well said of him, \"Nor did he ever do or say anything which was unbecoming a royal soul. He did not do as Cato the younger and Marcus Brutus, who laid violent hands on themselves; neither like Marius, who, incensed by his sufferings, let loose the reins of hatred and passion against his enemies ; but when he had recovered his ancient state and kingdom, he so carried it to those who had put him to so much hardship and trouble, that he seemed rather to remember that he was now their king, than that he had been sometimes their enemy. And even a little before his death, though a terrible distemper made an addition to the trials of his old age, yet was he so much him self as to confirm the present state of the kingdom, and to consult the peace and quiet of his posterity, so that when he died all men bewailed him as being deprived, not only of a just king, but of a loving father.\" There is an incident in the Bruce's life which still more strongly illustrates this force of sentimentalism, or shall we say heroic imprudence ? He was fighting for his brother Edward in Ireland, and was retreating before an overwhelming force of English and their Irish auxiliaries. His army had halted for a little, but the enemy was pressing on them, and they were about again to commence their re treat, when a piercing shriek fell upon the king's ears. He asked the cause, and was told that one of the camp-followers of the army \u2014 a washerwoman by occupa tion \u2014 had just been delivered of a child, and was shrieking with terror at the prospect of the cruel death which would await her at the hands of the rough Irish Kerns. Bruce knew the danger of delay, and reason told him that it would be ridiculous to halt his army for such a trivial cause; but human sentiment was strong within him. It gained the day. The army was halted and formed in line, and the king exposed his own life, and the safety of his forces, to preserve two lives, seemingly worthless in com parison. It is certainly quite impossible to imagine a modern general doing an action of this kind, and reason tells us that the modern general would be right. No man would ever think of stopping the march of an army now for such a trivial cause. Yet it is round such actions that, With this old abbey there is connected a humbler memory which deserves at least a passing notice. Robert Henryson, the poet, lived and died here. Lord Hailes tells us \" that he acted as pre ceptor in the Benedictine convent of the time.\" Of his life we know little, but he seems to have been comfortable and honoured, though both in a humble way. Mr. Wilson fixes his death a little before 1508, from a mention of him in Dunbar's \"Deth of the Makkaris,\" or poets. But his memory seems scarcely to have had an inspiring effect on Dunbar, or he would never have perpetrated the follow ing couplet of quaint doggerel : \u2014 In Dunfermline he has tane Brown, With gude Mr. Robert Henryson.

The United College is in North street, and St. Mary's, the theological foundation, is in South-street. These two colleges form the base of a triangle, of which the cathedral is the apex. With the details of the foundation of these establishments it is not our purpose to trouble the reader. Suffice it to say that Bishop Arnold began the cathedral in 1 159, and that it was finished under Bishop Lamberton in 13 iS. How much quicker it is to destroy than to builds This will seem to the reader one of the most commonplace of reflections ; but it strikes one with peculiar force when one hears that the wild havoc of one night of mad fury was sufficient to destroy this stately and noble erection \u2014 reared by the pious care of a long succession of gene rations. The mob the milder graces of life. With St. Andrew's his name is bound up in intimaterelation, andone striking scene in his life shows this in a particular manner. It is the following oft-repeated tale. He was confined as a galley slave on board the French fleet, which, in 1548, was lying off the coast of Scotland. The captives were exposed to every hardship and indignity ; and Knox, never a man of robust health, became so ill that his life was despaired of. His powerful and commanding mind was never better shown than in this situation. Somethino of the prophetic spirit animated his lofty soul as he assured his desponding fellow captives that \" God will deliver us to His glory, even in this life.\" One day, as the dawn broke, their ship was found to be unexpectedly near the coast, and the towers and spires of St. Andrew's could be plainly seen. One of Knox's fellow prisoners turned tothe apparently dying man and asked him if he knew that town. \"Yes,\" replied Knox, \"I know it well, for I see the steeple of that place where God first opened my mouth in public to His glory; and I am fully persuaded, how weak soever I may appear, that I shall not depart this life till that my tongue shall glorify His godly name in the same place.\" \" Wi' John Calvin in their heads, And hammers in their hands and spades, Enraged at idols, mass and beads, Dang the cathedral doun.\" The question is, however, whether it was really the love of the purer faith that caused the destruction of this, and of other like buildings, or whether it was not mere love of destruction, such as an unlettered mob, to whom the past is unknown and uncared for, will ever exhibit. Perhaps it is best to say that both elements were at work in the matter; that some struck from love of truth and some from love of mischief. However, the movement was so far judged necessary that it was sanctioned by the municipal authorities ; and Knox himself evidently watched such proceedings with a certain grim satisfaction. He was but human, and his otherwise great cha racter can well bear this reproach \u2014 if reproach it be\u2014 that he cared little for the tracery of a mullioned window, or the grand sweep of an arch. He had the sterner virtues, and it would be folly to deny that he was wanting in many of There are other memories of the re formers about St. Andrew's, sadder in deed, but still more profoundly interesting. These are the martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton, and the assassination of Car dinal Beaton. Two acts not merely remarkable for their stern atrocity, but of this historical importance, that they served to embitter, to a very great extent, the feuds between the old and the new faith. It was now war to the knife, and no reconciliation was any longer possible. Sir Walter Scott has given us the following graphic account of these events : \u2014 \" The Scottish affairs were now man aged almost entirely by Cardinal Beaton, a statesman, as we before observed, ot"], [189, "ST. ANDREWS, AND THE LEGEND OF ITS ORIGIN. 173 great abilities, but a bigoted Catholic, and a man of a severe and cruel tem per. He had gained entire influence over the Regent Arran, and had pre vailed upon that fickle nobleman to abandon the Protestant doctrines, recon cile himself to the Church of Rome, and consent to the persecution of the heretics, as the Protestants w7ere still called. Many cruelties were exercised; but that which excited public feeling to the highest degree, was the barbarous death of George Wishart. was then brought out, and fastened to a stake with iron chains. He was clad in a buckram garment, and several bags of gunpowder were tied round his body, to hasten the operation of the fire. A quantity of fagots were disposed around the pile. While he stood in expectation of his cruel death, he cast his eyes towards his enemy, the cardinal, as he sat on the battlements of the castle enjoying the dreadful scene. ' Captain,' he said to him who com manded the guard, ' may God forgive yonder man, who lies so proudly on the wall \u2014 within a few days he shall be seen lying there in as much shame as he now shows pomp and vanity.' This martyr to the cause of Reforma tion was a man of honourable birth, great wisdom and eloquence, and of primitive piety. He preached the doc trines of the Reformed religion with zeal and with success, and was for some time protected against the efforts of the vengeful Catholics by the barons who had become converts to the Protestant faith. At length, however, he fell into the hands of the cardinal, being surren dered to him by Lord Bothwell, and was conveyed to the castle of St. Andrew's, a strong fortress and palace belonging to the cardinal as archbishop, and there thrown into a dungeon. Wishart was then brought to a public trial, for heresy, before the Spiritual Court, where the cardinal presided. He was accused of preaching heretical doctrine, by two priests, called Lauder and Oliphant, whose outrageous violence was strongly contrasted with the patience and pre sence of mind shown by the prisoner. He appealed to the authority of the Bible against that of the Church of Rome; but his judges were little disposed to listen to his arguments, and he was con demned to be burnt alive. The place of execution was opposite to the stately castle ofthe cardinal, and Beaton himself sat upon the walls, which were hung with tapestry, to behold the death of his heretical prisoner. The spot was also carefully chosen, that the smoke of the pile might be seen as far as possible, to spread the greater terror. Wishart The pile was then fired, the powder exploded, the flames arose, and Wishart was dismissed by a painful death to a blessed immortality in the next world. Perhaps the last words of Wishart, which seemed to contain a prophetic spirit, incited some men to revenge his death. At any rate, the burning of that excellent person greatly increased the public detestation against the cardinal, and a daring man stood forth to gratify the general desire, by putting him to death. This was Norman Leslie, called the Master of Rothes, the same who led the men of Fife at the battle of Ancram moor. It appears, that besides his share of the common hatred to the cardinal as a persecutor, he had some private feud or cause of quarrel with him. With no more than sixteen men, Leslie undertook to assault the cardinal in his own castle, amongst his numerous guards and do mestics. It chanced that, as many workmen were still employed in labour ing upon the fortifications of the castle, the wicket of the castle-gate was open early in the morning, to admit them to their work. The conspirators took ad vantage of this, and obtained possession of the entrance. Having thus gained admittance, they seized upon the domes tics ofthe cardinal, and turned them one by one out of the castle, then hastened"], [190, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 174 to the cardinal's chamber, who had fastened the door. He refused them entrance, until they threatened to apply fire, when, learning that Norman Leslie was without, the despairing prelate at length undid the door, and asked for mercy. Melville, one of the conspira tors, told him he should only have such mercy as he had extended to George Wishart, and the other servants of God, who had been slain by his orders. He then, with his sword pointed to his breast, bid the cardinal say his prayers to God, for his last hour was come. The con spirators now proceeded to stab their victim, and afterwards dragged the dead body to the walls, to show it to the citizens of St. Andrew's, his clients and dependents, who came in fury to demand what had become of their bishop. Thus his dead body really came to lie with open shame upon the very battlements of his own castle, where he had sat in triumph to behold Wishart's execution..\" thundered against the greed of the no bility, the making of bishops, the tricks of the court, the lukewarmness of friends. James Melville, one of his most attached disciples, has left a striking account of those days. Melville was then a student at college, and the teaching of Knox made a profound impression on him. Sunday after Sunday, he tells us, he was there \" with my pen and my little buike and tuk away sic things as I could com prehend.\" Knox had almost to be carried into the pulpit, and faintly and wearily began his discourse till he \" enterit to application,\" and began to draw7 lessons as to the duty of those who loved the right in those days. Then he became more and more animated, till, as the hearer heard the burning words poured forth with passionate and intense conviction; \" he made me,\" he says, \" so greu and tremble that I could not hold a pen to wryt.\" It was these words that sank in Melville's heart, and that of many another St. Andrew's student, and made them strive, in after years, to realise that ideal ofa Church which Knox had set before them. One other scene we may be allowed to take from the ecclesiastical history of that troubled time. It is the year 157 1, and the reformed religion has definitely triumphed in Scotland. Knox is in St. Andrew's, but he is worn out, and feeble and sick. His friends are well aware that he cannot be with them much longer. He knew this well him self, and in a book written a little later, he describes himself as \"John Knox, the servant of Jesus Christ, now wearie of the world and daylie luiking for the resolution of this, my earthly tabernacle.\" He was weary of life, and besought his \"deir brethren to pray that God, in His mercy, will pleis to put an end to my long and painful battle.\" He felt, too, that his uncompromising spirit had raised him up enemies even among the re formers. \"As the world is wearie of me, so am I of it,\" he said. And yet there was much work to do, he thought, for the true faith in that land which he loved with so unselfish \u2014 so profound a devotion ; and so, week after week, he Of the University of St. Andrew's, of which Knox and Melville, and, indeed, all the most eminent men of the day were, or had been, members, it would not serve our purpose to give anything like a complete history. We shall merely state that it was founded in 141 1 by Bishop Wardlaw. This was St. Mary's College, which came to be exclu sively appropriated to divinity. Two other foundations were afterwards added \u2014 St. Salvator's in 1458, by Bishop Ken nedy, and St. Leonard's, in 1532, by Prior Hepburn. These were afterwards formed into one under the name of the United College, which is now in the ex clusive possession of the faculty of arts. It is thus altogether of Roman Catholic foundation, and the mention of this gives us an opportunity of saying a much needed word as to the share the old Church had in education. The reformers"], [191, "ST. ANDREWS, AND THE LEGEND OF ITS ORIGIN. 175 are usually given the credit for the foundation of the Scottish educational institutions, and certainly the zeal of Knox in the cause of learning, and his desire that the whole community should be properly taught, are among the most pleasing features in the character of that great man ; but it must be remembered that the most prominent feature in shows in a striking manner the effect of the older ideal upon modern life. For nearly 300 years the University of Edin burgh was a mere assemblage of lec turers. It had little or no corporate life. The Universities (Scotland) Act, 1S58, gave it a new existence. For the first time it had a chancellor, a vice-chancellor, and a rector. It was conformed to the GIASGOW UNIVERSITY. state of the others, and that is very much the same as saying that this was the reversal of a Presbyterian plan in favour of an earlier Catholic one. Scottish educational life is the universi ties, and that three of these directly, and the fourth\u2014 viz., Edinburgh\u2014 indirectly, owe their existence to the care of the bishops of the old religion. Intense zeal for education was a feature in the Scot tish character, when the people were as yet quite loyal to the court of Rome. Even the history of Edinburgh University St. Andrew's, of late years, has not been a very prosperous university, for which many reasons\u2014 in no way dero gatory to that ancient seat of learning may be given. There is, first and chief,"], [192, "176 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. the attraction which large towns seem to have in this age for the young and restless, and which brings all who can to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Then there isthefact that St. Andrew's is only an arts and theological school, and that it is impossible to complete the education of any student there save for the Established Church. Then it is not so well endowed \u2014 either for the benefit of professors or students \u2014 as the other universities. All these causes have acted and reacted on one another till the university has sunk to a very low condion. There is very much to be regretted in this, for one would think that the quiet seclu sion of St. Andrew's exactly fits it for a university town. Oxford and Cambridge are by no means very important towns, and what importance they do possess is derived entirely from the universities, and yet these continue to flourish. But the Scotch are very much less conservative than the English, and a movement once begun is liable to be pushed to far greater lengths. One would hope that, even though the life of St. Andrew's may not be so vigorous as of yore, that it will still continue to flourish as it has done for so many long years. his imperious spirit had alienated from him. This is all that can be said for him. At the Restoration he had gone to London to plead for the Presbyterian religion, and to remind Charles the Second that his majesty had himself sworn to observe the Covenant. That he was chosen for such an important mission shows the confidence that was reposed in him. He returned as Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and to the very end of life con tinued to persecute, with all a renegade's zeal, the cause that had been once his own. How passionately he was hated may be seen from the fact that his murder was considered as the natural and fit ending of such a man, even by those who could not bring themselves to approve it. By the great majority of the people of Scot land it was looked upon as a righteous and commendable act, and the perpe trators were considered as men whose memory deserved to be held in honour. It is difficult, indeed, for us to realise the feelings of those times, and more especi ally since one element, and that the very darkest, is wanting from all the hatreds of modern life. However a modern people may detest a tyrant or his ministers, they at least believe that he is merely human. But to the people of Scotland of that period, itwas an unquestioning belief that Shairp had the powers of darkness in league with him. In a court of justice it was affirmed against him that \" on Satur day night last, betwixt twelve and one o'clock, a muckle black devil was with him,\" and the statement was accepted by the common people as something horrible indeed, yet in the circumstances perfectly natural. Not very far from St. Andrew's lies Magus Muir, where the assassination of James Shairp, Archbishop of St. An drew's, took place. Shairp's name is closely connected with the town. There is a gorgeous monument to his memory in the church there, and as the event was not only strikingly illustrative of the times, but had important bearings on Scottish history, we shall give some de tailed account of it. Of Shairp himself it is impossible to say much good. Attempts, indeed, have been made to whitewash his character, but these have been signally unsuccessful. He was dar ing and firm of purpose. He was able to endure, with almost absolute indiffer ence, the concentrated scorn ofa passion ate and vindictive people, and the hardly concealed dislike of his colleagues, whom These things are stated, not to excuse the assassination, which it is certainly not our intention to do, but to explain it.

ANDRE W ' S, AND THE LEGEND OF ITS ORIGIN. 177 fallen long ago. And yet the circum stances that led to his death were curiously indirect \u2014 providential as the folk of the time named it. William Carmichael was at that time sheriff-substitute of Fife, and had made himself specially notorious for the zeal with which he hunted out the covenanter. A meeting was held to \" consult anent the condition of the shire, the Gospel being quite extinguished out of it, the hearts of many like to wax faint anent the keeping up of the same, through the terror and cruel oppression of William Carmichael.\" At this meet ing some things were said about Shairp, \" it being by many of the Lord's people and ministers judged a duty long since not to suffer such a person to live, w7ho had shed, and was shedding, so much of the blood of the saints, and knowing that other worthy Christians had used means to get him upon the road before.\" Car michael, w7hom they somewhat vaguely intended to \" deal with,\" escaped them; but, as they themselves afterwards said, they felt that they could not have been brought together for no purpose. As they were hanging about on the 4th of May of this year (1678) they were told that the archbishop, in his coach, was moving towards them on his way to St. Andrew's. Situated as they then were, armed and brought together to hunt down a persecutor who had been unex pectedly removed from their grasp, it was \" brought home to them,\" to use their own phrase, that here was an op portunity providentially created for them, not so much for revenge as for the exe cution of justice. It was speedily deter mined that Providence had decreed alike the doom of the tyrant, and their appointment to carry it out. They set forward to meet the coach. There is now some difficulty in recognising the scene of the tragedy that followed. Smiling cornfields lie interspersed with pleasant woods ; and everywhere there are the signs of cheerful prosperity. It was all then a wild moor, without cultivation, with no dwelling-place in sight, but sad, and gloomy, and dreary \u2014 a fit stage for the tragedy about to be enacted ; the only moving object on that spring morning being the heavy, lumbering coach of the period, driving along the road in one direction, and the band of horsemen rapidly approaching it from the other. Some shadow of his approaching doom seems to have fallen on the resolute soul of Shairp. As he looked out on the wild moor, and thought of the hatred men bore to him, he muttered, half to himself, half to his daughter, the only other occupant of the coach, \" God pre serve us, my child!\" His forebodings were soon justified. A horseman gal loped up alongside and fired into the coach. There was a vain attempt to distance the pursuers, but soon the carriage was stopped, and the attendants were cut down. The party that had now surrounded the vehicle, fired volley after volley, and then, under the full belief that they had slain the archbishop, wrere on the point of departure, when some sign caused them to make an examina tion, and they found him absolutely unhurt. The powers of darkness were evidently leagued together to protect their servant; but even such protection could not now avail him. With cries of \"Judas, come forth,\" they seized and dragged him out of the coach. His daughter prayed for his life, but she was sternly put back; he himself lost all his usual courage and resolution. He implored Hackston of Rathillet, who stood by on horseback, to intercede, piteously avowing that he had never done any of them any wrong. And then John Balfour of Burleigh, the leader of the party, spoke some cold, stern, resolute words, more appalling than the fiercest expression of rage. \"Sir, God is our witness that it is not for any wrong thou hast done to me, nor yet for any fear of what thou could do to me, but because thou hast been a murderer ot many a"], [194, "178 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. poor soul in the Kirk of Scotland, and a betrayer of the Church, and an open enemy and persecutor of Jesus Christ and His members, whose blood thou hast shed like water on the earth, and there fore thou shalt die.\" And so, after a good deal of blundering, the wretched prelate was despatched. greater force. One of them, William Daniel, fleeing just after the murder, was lodged in a lonely house, and saw no human countenance \" except the gentle woman, and her daughters brought him meat in the night-time.\" He was natu rally occupied during this solitude in reflecting on the terrible tragedy in which he had been an actor, and this is his own account of the time, as given to his companions when he rejoined them: \u2014 - He who thinks that the perpetrators of this cruel deed felt or could feel remorse at it, may be sure that he neither under stands the nature ofthe men nor of the times. The killing of Shairp was an act in which they all gloried to the last day of their lives. Some circumstances were noted as specially pointing to the Divine favour. Although the act was committed on the high road, and there were bodies of dragoons near, they were not at all disturbed, but were left to complete the deed in peace. Then the two of the party, Hackston and another, who had not actually touched Shairp, were the only two who were ever brought to answer to \" the justice or injustice of human tribunals\" \u2014 an evident reproof, it was thought, for their want of zeal. \"He told them that he had never so much ofthe presence of the Lord before ; for all that eight or nine days he was in a rapture, and the Lord had confirmed them, and approved of all that they had done; and still, to the day of his death, he was kept in a rapture of joy, and to his death witnessed against the indul gence, and declared that the Lord had let him see that it was hatched in hell for to ruin the Kirk of God.\" It were well that those who believe that any strength of personal conviction can prove the- righteousness of an act committed under it, should ponder on these words, which, consideringthe circumstances that inspired them, seem to us as some of the most remarkable that ever fell from human lips.

But there is' one name which at once Piper, quo' Meg, have you your bags, springs to our memory And is your orone in order ? whenever that county \u2014 webeg its pardon, kingdom \u2014 is mentioned, and that is Maggie Lauder. Years ago, we used \u2022to gaze across the Frith as we stood on the other coast, and imagine that her dwelling was somewhere between the shores of Fife and the Highland hills, and even yet, if we happen to be walk- ing in those parts, we should not be very much surprised to see her coming danc- ing round the bend of the road, accompanied with a shrill blast of the bagpipes! Tnis northern Venus was wed, and perhaps not very young, but she has the eternal beauty ot the creations of the fancy, whilst Rab the Ranter, alias the piper of Kilbarchan, was, we are convinced, a piper such as none in those degenerate days could match. How instinct with real poetic fire and force is the ballad that celebrates them \u2014 we hear the hero and we see the heroine as she comes from fairy-land on the scene. If you be Rab, I've heard of you, \u2014 Rive you upon the Border ?

Then to his bags he flew wi' speed, About ihe drone he twisted ; Meg up and walloped o'er the green, tor brawlie could she frisk it : Weel done ! quoih he. Play up, quo' she.

I've lived in Fife, baith maid an wife, These ten years and a quarter ; Gin ye should come to Anster Fair, Spier ye for Maggie Lauder. Now there is one thing in this song which we never could understand, and that was, why, when the piper \" speir'd what was't they ca'd her,\" Maggie should have abused him so unmercifully. Maggie, one would have thought, would have been as courteous as she was beau tiful, and would have returned a civil answer to a civil question. Ah, but there's the rub \u2014 was it a civil question ? We think not. Rab, we imagine, was rather a sad dog, and when he met a young lady MAGGIE LAUDER, Wha wadnae be in love Wi' bonnie Maggie Lauder 1 A piper met her gaun to File, And speir'd what was't they ca'd her Right scornfully thus answered she, Begone, you hallan-shaker ; Jog on your gate, you blether-skate, My name is Maggie Lauder."], [196, "180 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. incident in a feud between the families of the Earls of Murray and Huntly. The then Earl of Murray was remarkable for his beauty, and the king thought that his queen, Anne of Denmark, looked on him with far too favourable an eye. He was therefore easily induced to believe that \" Murray was in league with Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, in a traitorous attempt against the royal person.\" A warrant was issued against him, and put into the willing hands of the Earl of Huntly for execution. Huntly's grandfather had fallen at the battle of Corrichie, and his son John, with some of his adherents, had been executed immediately after. John was said to be a queen's lover too, and Murray commanded the opposing forces. walking along the high road, no doubt he thought this was a fine opportunity for a little sly flirtation. So with a wink and an ahem ! just to attract attention, he began in an insinuating tone of voice by inquiring what was't (there is just a touch of insolent familiarity there) they ca'd her? But Maggie was equal to the occasion. With judicious firmness she forthwith intimated that she was not to be trifled with, justly described him as a \" blether-skate,\" and bade him begone about his business. At the same time she did answer his question \u2014 My name is Maggie Lauder. Now was not Rab ashamed of himself ? and yet he took his snubbing quite meekly. Indeed, he was so delighted at having at last met so famous a dancer that he at once offered to play her a tune. Well, Mag gie, like all generous people, was easily pacified, and so he played and she danced to their hearts' content, and as they parted Maggie trysted him to meet her at Anster Fair, gently intimating that even in that vast crowd there would be no difficulty in finding her, so well was she known to fame. Cruel Murray gar'd the waefu queen look out And see her lover and lieges slain. This young Gordon had been distin guished for his beauty, so history seemed to repeat itself in a curious fashion. When the house was surrounded Murray, who knew that he was doomed, refused to surrender. He fought his way out, sword in hand, but was overpowered. Huntly gave him a fatal stroke across the face, and as the dying man fell he gasped out, \" Thou hast spoiled a fairer face than thine own\" \u2014 a strange in stance of the ruling passion strong in death. The ballad completes the story : \u2014 It is only fair to mention the name of Francis Sempill (1605- 1680) in connec tion with this ballad, though we must add that it is questionable if he really was the author. We shall meet Maggie again, but in the meantime we may state that the royal burgh of East Anstruther claims her as a citizeness, but whether the claim be just or not we cannot pre tend to decide. Ye Hielands and ye Lawlands, A German antiquary has said of Scot land, that it isa place where every stone has its history, and, indeed, there is no mouldering castle, no heap of ruined stones that once formed a fair cloister, that is not memorable for some story of war or piety, lighted with some gleams of long-past love, or dark with some tale of revenge. Here in Fife ruin and accompanying story meet us at every turn. Not far from Aberdour is Doni bristle Castle, memorable for a bloody Oh whaur hae ye been ? They hae slain the Earl o' Murray, And hae lain him on the green. \" Now wae be to thee, Huntly '. And wherefore did ye sae ?

It is now best known by the charming ballad which Scott has written, and which is entitled \" Rosabelle.\" The incident is of course purely imaginary, though Rosabelle has always been one of the family names \u2014 \" Henry St. Clair, the second of the line, having married Rosabelle, fourth daughter of the Earl of Stratherne.\" In reference to family names and titles this line seems to have been particularly strong, and even Sir Walter, good old tory and keen anti quarian as he was, becomes slightly ironical as he recounts the titles of the founder of Roslin chapel, to wit : \u2014 O lang, lang will his lady Look ower the Castle Doun, Ere she see the Earl o' Murray Come sounding through the toun. In the neighbourhood is the castle of Rosythe, once inhabited by a branch of the family of Stewart. Oliver Crom well's mother is said to have been of this family, and the Protector himself had such faith in the tradition that he visited the castle when he was in Scotland. The story is, however, to be received with very considerable caution. The temptation to connect Charles II., the king in name, with Cromwell, the king in fact, and to join in ties of blood Charles I. and the man who killed him, was too great a bait for the myth-making imagination to resist. The statement would require stronger proof than has ever yet been adduced before it be accepted as historically true. One of the Lords of the castle was a bit of a gourmand \u2014 rather a rare character in Scotland \u2014 and moreover he detested waiting for his dinner. Accordingly he hung a bell in the tower, and carved there the following warning to his ser vants: \u2014 \u25a0 \"The beautiful chapel of Roslin is still in tolerable preservation. It was founded in 1446 by William St. Clair, Prince ot Orkney, Duke of Oldenbourgh, Earl of Caithness and Stratherne, Lord Saint Clair, Lord Niddesdale, Lord Admiral of the Scottish Seas, Lord Chief Justice of Scotland, Lord Warden of the Three Marches, Baron of Roslin, Pentland, Pentland-moor, etc., Knight of the Cockle and of the Garter (as is affirmed), High Chancellor, Chamberlain, and Lieutenant of Scotland.\" However, this noble and ancient family may well pardon one who has enriched their annals with this beautiful ballad, to the right understanding of which it is only necessary to add that it was a tradition in the family that the chapel glowed with supernatural light when one of the race was about to die : \u2014 In . Deu . Tym . Draw . Yes . Cord . Ye . Bell To . Clink . Quhais . Mery . Voce . Varnis . To . Meat . And Drink. On a precipitous rock near Kirkcaldy is the castle of Ravensheuch, of which Scott says it is \"a large and strong castle, now ruinous, situated betwixt Kirkcaldy and Dysart, on a steep crag, washed by the Frith of Forth. It was conferred on Sir William St. Clair, as a slight com pensation for the Earldom of Orkney, by a charter of King James III., dated in 1471, and is now the property of Sir James St. Clair Erskine (now Earl of Rosslyn), representative of the family. O listen, listen, ladies gay ! No haughty feat of arms I tell ; Soft is the note, and sad the lay, That mourns the lovely Rosabelle, \u2014 \"Moor, moor the barge, ye gallant crew ! And, gentle ladye, deign to stay ; Rest thee in Castle Ravensheuch, Nor tempt the stormy firth to-day. \" The blackening wave is edged with white ; To inch and rock the see-mews fly ; The fishers have heard the Water Sprite, Whose screams forebode that wreck is nigh."], [198, "182 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. And each St. Clair was buried there, With candle, with book, and with knell ; \" Last night the gifted Seer did view A wet shroud swathed round ladye gay ; But the sea-caves rung, and the wild winds sung The dirge of lovely Rosabelle. Then stay thee, Fair, in Ravensheuch : Why cross the gloomy firth to-day ? \" There are two places in Fife of which we must at least mention the names. There is Cupar, of which we shall only say \u2014 and we confess the information is neither \" rich nor rare\" \u2014 that it is the county town ; and the old burgh of Falkland, whose chief point of interest is of course the Palace. This, like so many of the famous spots in Fife, pos sesses a sort of half-mythical history, connecting it with the Macduffs. Here the Duke of Rothesay was cruelly murdered by his uncle in 1402, and here, too, James V. died of a broken heart. It was a favourite residence of James VI., and the last gleam of interest that attaches to it is also kingly, for that robber chieftain, the famous Rob Roy, without taking the trouble to ask per mission, installed himself there during the '15, and ruled right royally in the surrounding district \u2014 at any rate he per formed one important function of rulers, viz., he levied contributions from his tem porary subjects, so that, though they might agree in the first half of Bailie Nicol Jarvie's estimate of him, viz., \"that he was no guid enuch for blessing,\" it is very much to be questioned if they con curred in the second part of the re mark \u2014 \"that he was o'er guid for banning.\" No doubt they relieved themselves by \"banning\" him with great energy and \u2014 caution. \" 'Tis not because Lord Lindsay's heir To-night at Roslin leads the ball ; But that my Ladye-mother there Sits lonely in her castle-hall. \" 'Tis not because the ring they ride, And Lindsay at the ring rides well : But that my sire the wine will chide, If 'tis not filled by Rosabelle.\" O'er Roslin all that dreary night A wondrous blaze was seen to gleam ; 'Twas broader than the watch-fire light, And redder than the bright moon-beam. It glared on Roslin's castled rock, It ruddied all the copse-wood glen ; 'Twas seen from Dryden's groves of oak, And seen from caverned Hawthornden. Seemed all on fire that chapel proud, Where Roslin's chiefs uncoffined lie : Each baron, for a sable shroud, Sheathed in his iron panoply. Seemed all on fire, within, around, Deep sacristy and altar's pale ; Shone every pillar foliage-bound, And glimmered all the dead men's mail. Blazed battlement and pinnet high, Blazed every rose-carved buttress fair \u2014 So still they blaze, when fate is nigh The lordly line of high St. Clair. There are twenty of Roslin's barons bold Lie buried within that proud chapelle ; Each one the holy vault doth hold \u2014 But the sea holds lovely Rosabelle !"], [199, "A TRIP ALONG THE SHORES OF FIFE. 183 A. Trip Along the Shores of Fife. IFE, as we have al- ready hinted, is a meets our eye on the right. Far off there is the white top of the Bass, and ruined Tantallon frowning stern de fiance even in decay, whilst on our left is the somewhat more precipitous Fife coast, curving in many a bay, with its wooded heights glittering in the sun light as it winds on to the ocean. First there is little Aberdour, with its fine woods. In the parish is the island of Incholm, where there are the ruins of a monastery. There is some dim tradition that it was, in pre-Christian times, aplace frequented by the Druids, like the \"shaggy top of Mona,\" where those old bards, the famous Druids, lie; but, at all events, at a very early period it was inhabited by a venerable hermit, who lived here in pious solitude. It happened that Alex ander the First had occasion to cross the Forth, and that while on the way he was overtaken by a great storm. It almost seemed as if he would be wrecked. There was no refuge near but Incholm, and the waves were thundering on the shore of the little, and apparently de solate, island. In this hour of terror the King thought of those whose profession it was to sail daily on the treacherous element, and he vowed, if he survived this danger, to found a monastery on this bleak spot, whose special care should be to tend seamen and fishermen cast here by the storm. The party landed, not without difficulty, on the coast, and here were discovered by the hermit, who entertained them as he was best able, for three days, during which period the storm continued to rage. In due time the King got across to Fife, but he did not forget his promise. A stately erection soon rose, and for many a long day was a beacon of hope to the storm tossed sailor. The King endowed it richly from his private possessions, and kingdom, and the expression was no doubt applied in the first instance to Pictavia, of which it formed a part, \" and the continuance of the title,\" says an authority, \"to the smaller portion, of which the present Fife forms the eastern half, was due as much to its being the southern part of Pictavia as to its distinct peninsular form, and to the fact that Pictish kings had their resi dence within its territories. In any case the title, as applied to Fife, had the sanction of very ancient usage. In the tract of the 'Scots of Dalriada' there occur the words, ' the men of Fife in the sovereignty,' and in Wynton's chronicle, whose date is 1380, Fife is spoken of as a Kynrich (a Kingdom). The power and influence of the thanes of Fife, and the existence afterwards of Royal residences at Dunfermline and Falkland, doubtless aided in continuing the title down to later times. The first trace of the name Fif occurs in the old verses ascribed to St. Columba, where, under the form Fif, it is used as the designation of one of the seven provinces into which, ac cording to Beda, the ancient kingdom of Pictavia was divided.\" But enough of these dry arch\u00e6ological details. Our purpose in the present article is to touch on some of the points of interest connected with the coast-line of the old kingdom ; a coast-line which, as Buchanan graphically says, is \" girt with townlets.\" We can imagine our selves sailing right in the middle of the Firth, with the bow of our vessel turned straight out to the open sea.

It was formally con stituted by Pope Alexander III. in 1178 and flourished in riches and splendour through many centuries. It is to be hoped that the King made the hospitable monk the first abbot of the new founda tion. no less than 1,030 marks from Kirkaldy, and the receipt therefor is still to be seen among the burgh records. When the Marquis of Montrose and the Royalists triumphed at Kilsyth in 1645, so many of the inhabitants of Kirkaldy were among the defeated party, that two hundred widows of the old burgh mourned the fatal day. The town did a good deal of shipping business in those days, and it gave liberally to support the cause of the reformed re- ligion. Indeed, it seems to have been mulcted whichever star was in the ascendant \u2014 on the one side of its own free will, on the other side by force. At the Revolution of 1688 the citizens distin- guished themselves by seizing the Earl of Perth, Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, and one of the worst instru- ments of the tyranny of James. They kept him five days and five nights in prison \" under a constant guard of 500 men, and sent him under a convoy of three boats, manned with 200 hands, to Alloa, where they handed him over to the Earl of Mar.\" It is not to be supposed that so many men and boats were needed for the apprehension and safe guarding and conveyance of a single man, but probably they wished to show how zealous they all were in the good work. They seem to have parted rather reluctantly with their prisoner\u2014 for they were inordinately proud of their capture \u2014 as they demanded and received a receipt for him. The town has later literary memoirs of remarkable interest. On the 5th of June, 1723, Adam Smith was born here, and here he remained till his fourteenth year, when he was sent to the University of Glasgow. It is interesting to note that when about three years old the little Adam was kidnapped by a party of gipsies. His uncle, Mr. Douglas, pursued them, came up with them in an adjacent wood, and promptly rescued the boy. On what small acci dents do the whole course ofthe lives \u2014 even of the greatest of men, depend 1 A little further east is Burntisland, so called from the steep nature of the cliffs on the shore. On the coast near King- horn is the Black Rock, near which Alexander III. was thrown from his horse and sustained that \" fatal fall \" which had such effect on the history of his country. Kinghorn itself is a very old town, erected into a royal burgh by David I., though the name has nothing to do with royalty any more than Burntisland has with insular position. The small cape that is near the town is know7n in Gaelic as garn or garm, \" signifying the blue head,\" and from this the name is derived, as is shown in the popular title of the town, which is Kin-garn. Although the pedigree of Kinghorn is very long, it cannot be said to be very distinguished, and the burgh, about the beginning of the century, is stated, on the authority of Chambers, \" to have been one of the most irregular and meanly-constructed towns in the dis- trict\" \u2014 though all has been much changed and improved of late years. A little further on and we come to the \"Lang toun\" of Kirkaldy, which is not only \"lang,\" but somewhat straggling and ungraceful. Still, it has got a history of its own, and that a by no means discreditable one. The citizens have been \"true blue\" Presbyterians from the very first. In 1662 the Pro- testant churches of France were strug- gling with many and various and grie- vous difficulties \u2014 chief of which was a terrible lack of funds \u2014 and so it occurred to them that they would send an em- bassy over to Britain on purpose to raise money. They did so, and among the contributions they obtained was one for"], [201, "A TRIP ALONG THE SHORES OF FIFE. 185 Had Mr. Douglas taken the turning to the left instead of that to the right, the gipsies might have escaped with their prey.

Smith must have had a strong liking for the old town, for after he had travelled over a great part of Europe, and filled a professor's chair at Glasgow, after he had seen most things that an educated man of the time might think worth seeing, he returned to Kirkaldy, where he lived till a subsequent appoint ment made him break up his household,"], [202, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 186 He sleeps in a neglected grave in the churchyard of the Canongate. His friend Hume lies not far off, under that classic-looking tower on the Calton Hill. Hence it is the parish of caves. Between the little fishing villages of East and West Wemyss lies Wemyss Castle. Here Mary first met Darnley, and each was profoundly impressed by the \" fatal gift of beauty \" which the other pos sessed. Those who have the most rudi mentary acquaintance with the history of Scotland will easily remember the baneful influence which the connection between Mary and Darnley had on Scottish history. If Queen Mary had only been ugly and stupid, how strangely altered the history of her country would have been, is the reflection which strikes one as one gazes on the \" rude medallion figure of a Queen Mary's cap,\" which in loyal remembrance of her visit was carved over the door where she entered. The noble family of Wemyss \u2014 one of the oldest in Scotland \u2014 takes its titles from this part of the country, and here its representatives once resided. It is said to be derived from the still more ancient line of the Macduffs, Thanes of Fife, and various stories connect the families with the caves already men tioned. During the cave of Adullam period, Lord Elcho, who formed one of the famous band that took refuge therein, and whose name of \" Adul lamites\" has become a recognised title in English political history, was called to account by his constituents for his defection from the Liberal party. He gave an explanation which, if not satis factory, was at least ingenious and happy. He recalled to the memory of the electors the part of Fife from which his family name was derived, explained how intimately his family had been con nected with caves from an early period, and accounted for his secession by the recurrence of an old family tendency! Beyond East Wemyss lies Macduff Castle, the traditionary seat of the Thanes of Fife. The sea washes its base and roars in the hollow caverns of the rocks, and thunders in storm-time on the bold headland. But the castle is Kirkaldy holds the memory of another friendship not less honourable and hardly less distinguished. The namesof Thomas Carlyle and Edward Irving, no less than those of Adam Smith and David Hume, occur to us as we think of that northern burgh. Smith said of Hume that he realised, as nearly as it was possible for human weakness to realise, the picture ofthe per fectly wise man. Of Irving, Carlyle has said, in words of fire :\u2014 \"But for Irving I had never known what the communion of man with man means. His was the purest, brotherliest, bravest human soul man ever came in contact with. I call him, on the whole, the best man I have ever (after trial enough) found in this world, or now hope to find.\" They were both at Kirkaldy as young men, and both engaged in teaching \u2014 Carlyle hating his calling, and looking forward with gloomy discontent and uncertainty to the future : Irving full of high hope, preparing himself for the Church, from out of which, as unworthy, he was doomed to be cast. Many a walk among the woods, many a ramble on the moonlit shore, had the friends, as we learn from the profoundly interesting, if saddening, \" Remini scences ; \" and no doubt Irving again and again strove to cheer the spirits of his friend. Both are at last at rest after their storm-tossed existence. With all their faults, it may be justly said that there are no names of which Scotland has more reason to be proud, Past Kirkaldy is Dysart, which does not call for any special notice, and then we come to a part of the coast which demands some little attention.

We must hurry \u2022on, however, past the fishing village of Buckhaven, said to have been founded by the shipwrecked crew of a Netherlands vessel, and Innerleven, a fishing village belonging to the inland parish of Markinch. The origin ofthe connection was that it was bound to supply certain ecclesiastical establishments of that parish with fish in such seasons as the rules of the Church required that diet. We pass by the Leven, which here falls into the sea, and likewise the town of the same name, a place reported to be like Constantinople in one respect \u2014 that it looks charming from the sea, and \u2014 well, not so enticing when you are once in. But now we are in Largo Bay, and here we must anchor our good ship for a little, for we have several points of interest to dwell on. Largo itself is double, \"There are two places of that name. There is the village inland half-a-mile, with its church and belfry, and there is the coast lineos little ancient houses by the shore, where the fishermen dwell.\" We are not specially interested in the village, double or single, which is much like other fishing villages, of evil odour, and much given to bicker ing and windy strife. Still, about fish ing villages there is always the sea. If you get tired of the narrow street and the struggling lives of the poor fisher folk, you can go along the coast, and commune with \"the much resounding main,\" and if Largo be the fishing village, you have another choice, for the walks inland are most delightful, and you can climb Largo Law with out very much exertion \u2014 it is but a thousand feet high \u2014 and then you can view the fair shores of the Kingdom of Fife, and the blue Firth and the fertile fields of East Lothian, whilst the eye catches many \" castle walls \" and \" sum mits famed in story.\" You will be in clined, if not like Fitz-Eustace's gallant steed, to execute a \" demi-volte in air,\" still to exclaim with its enthusiastic rider \u2014 Where's the coward that would not dare To fight for such a land ? Largo is connected with two notable seamen \u2014 Sir Andrew Wood of Largo, and Alexander Selkirk, the original of the world-famed Robinson Crusoe. Sir Andrew vvas born at Largo about 1450, and was at first a merchant, and a very successful one too. In his good ships the Flower and the Yellow Carvel, he traded to Holland, and thus acquired his wealth. He was afterwards ap- pointed pilot to James III., who gave him \"a lease of the lands of Largo, on the terms of keeping his ship the Yellow Carvel in repair, for conveying his Highness and the Queen to the Isle of May when they should makea pilgrimage hither.\" Afterwards Wood gave him- self up entirely to the defence of his country. The Flower and the Yellow Carvel became a terror to the English vessels, and King Harry the Seventh gave private notice to his mariners that he who captured Wood, or at any rate put an end to his famous squadron, should be handsomely recompensed. Accordingly one Stephen Bull set out with \"three tall ships,\" well manned, and came upon Admiral Wood off St. Abb's Head. The Scotch were out- numbered, but Wood ordered his \"merry men \" to be \"stout against these their enemies,\" and assured them that \"for mine own part, with God to help, I sail show you a good example,\" and to such purpose did he fight, that after a com- bat of two days' duration, the English vessels were obliged to strike their sails, and were carried to the Port of Dundee, where both conqueror and con quered were right royally feasted by the King, who afterwards dismissed Master Bull and his brave companions without ransom.

The confederate lords hardly knew how to dispose of her. The whole people about Edinburgh were raging for her blood, whilst in other parts of the town, where there were \" Gordons or Hamiltons, or Catholic Highlanders,\" a rescue might be attempted were she placed near them. Loch Leven Castle was in the possession of Sir William Douglas, half brother to the Earl of Murray. Froude, in a few graphic words, tells the story of her journey: \u2014 \"It was unsafe to remove her by daylight. After dark, on Monday evening, the Queen was taken down to Holyrood. The streets were full as ever, and a guard of 300 men was barely sufficient to keep off the howling people. She went on foot, be tween Athol and Morton, amidst welter ing cries of 'Burn her, burn her! she is not worthy to live ! Kill her, drown her ! ' Could the mob have reached her, she would have been sent swiftly, with a stone about her neck, into the Nor' Loch. The palace was not safe even for the night. In an hour or two she was carried on to Leith, and thence across the water to Burntisland ; a rapid ride of twenty miles brought her thence to the island fortress, where, early on Tuesday (so swiftly the work was designed and executed) the Queen of Scotland was left to rest and collect her senses.\" HE chief, if not the only special object of interest in the shire of Kinross is Loch Leven, which lies to the south- east ofthe county. Its situation is very beautiful. On the north and west side lies the broad and fertile vale of Kinross, adorned with man sions, and finely wooded. It slopes gently up to the Ochil Hills. At the east end of the loch the ground is much more precipitous. On the north are the Lomond Hills; on the south Binarty Hill \u2014 both rising from the very edge of the water \u2014 whilst in the ravine between the river Leven flows. At the extreme west are the town of Kinross, Kinross House, and the Castle of Burleigh. The loch is popularly supposed to be \" mysteriously connected with the number eleven, being eleven miles round, surrounded by eleven hills, fed by eleven streams, peopled by eleven kinds of fish, and studded by eleven islands.\" The most noted of the islands are two \u2014 one called St. Serf's Island, this saint having come all the way from Canaan to Inchkeith. Bondeus, a king of the Picts, established a religious house here for the Culdees. Under David I., the foundation \u2014 of whose ruins but the scan tiest remnants remain \u2014 was placed under St. Andrew's. The other island is said to have been first fortified by \" Congal, son of Dongart, king of the Picts,\" and the castle on it played a very important part in various epochs of Scottish history. But there is one association that is the most deeply interesting of all. It was here that Queen Mary was placed on June 16, 1567, and from here she escaped May 2, 1568. This was after the The almost immediate discovery of the famous casket letters roused the passions of the people against her to mad ness, and induced the lords to de mand her abdication, or to bring her to trial for her life.

At any rate she signed, and \"stood dethroned, a queen without a crown.\" romance has to say most, and so this period has had a particular charm for the poet and the romance writer. Its details are filled in with all Scott's accustomed skill in the \" Abbot ; \" and Burns, in one of his most charming poems, has given us what we may well believe to have been her sentiments as she saw the returning spring add tenfold beauty to the fair landscape stretched before her eyes. He has called it \"Lament of Mary, Queen of Scots, on the approach of spring,\" and though some passages would seem to point it out as belonging to a much later portion of her life, yet it may very fitly be applied to this, her first imprisonment : \u2014 There is no part of Mary's life, roman tic though it be, which is more interest ing and mysterious than her year's captivity on this lonely spot. According to a French writer, the island was a gloomy place, always surrounded by mists, whilst bats and owls inhabited the sad dungeon of the captive ; but this is probably an exaggeration. Still, she must have been excessively uncomfort able. The castle was a square, narrow keep of the most commonplace character, in which a large household was crowded together, and in which much privacy was impossible. Then, Mary was a cap tive, and however kindly treated, her treatment must have always had much of precaution and restraint in it. She must have found the change terrible after the comparative roominess of Holy rood, after the deference of a court, and the hawking and hunting parties to which she had been accustomed. Still more terrible must the solitude of the little community have seemed after the mad dening excitement of the past few months. \"For quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,\" says the poet, and here it must have been specially true. Burton says that we really know nothing of what her life was during that year, and this is partly correct. Ofthe details we know nothing; but we know that she was continually intriguing, and that she was bending all her energies in order to devise some means to escape from confinement. It often \u2014and naturally enough, too\u2014 happens that where history has to say least, Now Nature hangs her mantle green On every blooming tree, And spreads her sheets o' daisies white Out o'er the grassy lea : Now Ph\u0153bus cheers the crystal streams, And glads the azure skies ; But nought can glad the weary wight That fast in durance lies. Now lav'rocks wake the merry morn, Aloft on dewy wing ; The merle, in his noontide bow'r, Makes woodland echoes ring ; The mavis wild wi' many a note, Sings drowsy day to rest : In love and freedom they rejoice, Wi' care nor thrall oppress. Now blooms the lily by the bank, The primrose down the brae : The hawthorn's budding in the glen, And milk-white is the slae : The meanest hind in fair Scotland, May rove their sweets amang ; But I, the Queen of a' Scotland, Maun lie in prison strang. I was the Queen o' bonnie France, Where happy I hae been : Fu' lightly rase I in the morn, As blithe lay down at e'en ; And I'm the sovereign ol Scotland, And mony a traitor there : Yet here I lie in foreign bands And never-ending care.

The first at tempt was made by changing clothes with the laundress, who came to pay her usual visit. The Queen in this disguise got safely into the boat, and was almost across at the shore, when the fact that she remained silent and kept her face covered, seemed to have excited the curiosity of the boatmen. \"Let us see what manner of dame this is,\" said one of them, as he at tempted to pull the covering from her face. She put up her hands to protect herself, and the boatmen noticed how white and delicate these were, and in stantly they understood who the veiled lady was. When she found herself dis covered, she was \" little dismayed, but charged them, upon danger of their lives, to row her over to the shore.\" This, however, they would not do, but immediately carried her back to the castle. Her strange power of fascina tion seemed not to be without power even here, for with a certain touch of chivalrous feeling, they assured her that ' the attempt should be secreted, and especially from the lord of the house under whose guard she lyeth.' \" On the shore at Kinross, George Douglas, and some other of her adherents, were waiting to bear her to a place of safety. The second attempt was more success ful. William got hold of the keys of the castle one Sunday might, when the family were at supper. When all was still for the night, George Douglas and the other anxious watchers on the shore saw a light from the upper part oi the keep gleam fitfully for a moment on the dark waters of the loch. They knew that the plan had succeeded, and soon they could clearly discern the outline of a boat as it rapidly neared the shore. William had safely let the Queen and her maid out of the tower and into the skiff. He then proceeded to row them over the loch. He had securely locked the castle behind him, and now, with a touch of boyish mischief, he let the keys drop into the loch, where they lay till Was never known to thee ; Nor th' balm that draps on wounds of woe Frae woman's pitying e'e.

As one has again and again occasion to note, it is this mixture of thrilling romance with grave state business that lends such a piquant charm to every de tail of Mary's life. This George Douglas was the younger brother of Sir William Douglas, the Lord of the Castle, and he was for some time employed in the duty of guarding her. He conceived a passion ate love for his charge, in which loyalty to his sovereign, romantic fidelity, and soaring ambition were all strangely mingled, and Queen Mary, whether touched by his devotion, or whether in spired merely by political reasons, gave him a certain encouragement.

A later Sir Walter, under James I. of England, is celebrated in history after a very different fashion ; for he is credited with having drafted off into foreign service many of the Border freebooters, and so brought about a state of tranquillity on the frontier which it must have seemed too much to hope for. and her many ad- ventures we make our escape to \"Ettrick Forest,\" of which Scott loved to call himself sheriff. The W$) river takes its rise in the hill- I country near to the pleasant little town of Moffat, and wends its way through a beautiful stretch of country, uniting with the Yarrow near to Selkirk, and finally losing itself in the Tweed just by Abbots ford. To this vale the name of Scott, as represented by others than the great novelist, lends no little interest, for yonder, at the head of the river, lies Buccleugh, a little estate almost hidden among the hills, but notable as giving a title to the head of the great Border clan. We know little of the early repre sentatives of Buccleugh, and all that can be surmised of them is that they were men of war, roving men as was the man ner of the time.

His earliest home is supposed to have been in the upper part of the vale, near to \"Ettrick kirk,\" in a district tenanted mostly by shepherds and their sheep. Here Hogg spent his early years, and at the tender age of seven he is found a hired servant, herding some cows upon the lonely hills, and getting, as six-months' wage, we are told, \" a ewe lamb and a pair of new shoes.\" From this time until he was fifteen years of age, he was mainly occupied in the same way, enduring much hardness, as he tells us, yet not, we are sure, without some compensations. A nature like his was sure to have received expansion and illumination amid the glories of those lone hills, as well as softness and beauty by the banks of his native stream. And there is a little sentence in his auto- biography which points to yet another well-spring of poesy of which he did not forget to avail himself in those solitary days. \"All this while,\" says he, \"I neither read nor wrote ; nor had I access to any book save the Bible. I was greatly taken with our version of the Psalms of David, learned the most of them by heart, and have a great par- tiality for them unto this day.\" eminent philosopher; the while we can picture to ourselves how the folk of Ettrick, suspicious of any hidden lore, would point with awe and horror to the tower, and tell how there dwelt \" auld Michael.\" Let us tarry a moment by this spot, and hear the monk in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\" tell his tale of him : \u2014 \" I was not dways a man of woe ; For Paynim countries I have trod, And fought beneath the Cross of God ; Now, strange to my eyes thine arms appear, And their iron clang sounds strange to my ear. In these far climes it was my lot To meet the wondrous Michael Scott : A wizard of such dreaded fame, That when, in Salamanca's cave, Him listed his magic wand to wave, The bells would ring in Notre Dame ! Some of his skill he taught to me ; And, warrior, I could say to thee The words that cleft Eildon hills in three, And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone ; But to speak them were a deadly sin, And for having but thought them my heart within, A treble penance must be done. When Michael lay on his dying bed, His conscience was awakened : He bethought him of his sinful deed, And he gave me a sign to come with speed ; 1 was in Spain when the morning rose, But I stood by his bed ere evening close. The words may not again be said, That he spoke to me, on death-bed laid, They would rend this Abbaye's massy nave, And pile it in heaps above his grave. I swore to bury his mighty Book, That never mortal might therein look ; And never to tell where it was hid, Save at his Chief of Bianksome's need ; And when that need was past and o'er.

It is impossible for us to give at length the tender and touching poem in which he bade \" Farewell to Ettrick.\" but we must give a few lines of it to show how deeply graven his home was upon his heart ; and, if so it may be, also to interweave, in the reader's mind, thoughts of the place and the man to whom it was a kind of foster-mother : \u2014 Other associations than these, however, gather around this district, as the name \"Ettrick Forest\" indicates; but space does not allow us to dwell upon these. Enough to say that in early days it was not the quiet, pastoral land which we see to-day, but \u2014 so far as the lower reaches of the river are concerned, \u2014 was a great wood, in which the king and his courtiers were used to hunt. Hence the old lines: \u2014 \" Farewell, green Ettrick ! fare-thee-weel I I own I'm unco laith to leave thee ; \" Ettrick Forest is a fair forest, In it grows many a seemly tree ; The hart, the hind, the doe, the roe, And of all wild beasts great plentie.\" Nane kens the half o' what I feel, Nor half the cause I hae to grieve me I There first I saw the rising morn ; But all this is now past, and we should not like to say how much or how little royalty, for many a day, has seen of the forest.

I thought the hills were sharp as knives, We do not look upon it as any chief part of our work in this book to say much about towns, at least about those of them which merely represent modern activity, and hence we have passed over Hawick and Galashiels, important centres of Border manufacture, without giving them what their respected inhabitants might think due notice; but Selkirk, to which Ettrick Water brings us, demands a notice, however brief. To-day Selkirk is little more than a pushing little town, busy in the manufacture ot \"tweeds;\" but it has a history of its own. Its inhabitants in the dire day of Flodden \u2014 most of them sutors, or shoemakers \u2014 had a large contingent in the battle; and history tells, to tneir lasting honour, how, when the white feather was shown by many another clan, this band of per chance despised shoemakers stood firm, \"and dyed the fieldwith southron blood;\" and how, despite the darts which flew about, and at risk of being trampled under horses' hoofs, they carried their standard away from the fatal field un dishonoured, and kept it as a lasting memorial of their faithfulness. No won der the old saying goes, then, \" Up wi'\" the sutors of Selkirk! \" An' the braid lift lay whomeled on them, An' glowered wi' wonder at the wives That spak o' ither hills ayon' them.

But we cannot help it; and when you turn your steps thither, you will understand what we mean. Just as by Windermere and Grasmere, at Keswick and at Fox How, your thoughts wander away to Words worth and to Coleridge, to Southey and to Arnold, as by \" Alloway1 s auld haunted kirk \" you think little about the old building, and much about Robert Burns, so by \"Ettrick's stream\" your thoughts are only, as it were, kept in tune by the river's murmur, while your mind turns now to the \" bauld Buc cleugh,\" and now to Ettrick's gentle \" Shepherd.\""], [213, "THE VALE OF ETTRICK. 197 Nor must we neglect to mention that in later times Selkirk has been identified with the names of men who, in various ways, have reflected signal honour upon her.

'HERE are many famous We have all our difficulties, and if we* look merely at external circumstances, it cannot be denied that many men have begun life under very much worse cir cumstances than he did, and have yet died well enough off. He was strong and clever, and well, if plainly, educated; and it may be said that if he wanted the commonplace comforts of home-life, and the respect of his fellows, it was because he did not choose to obtain them. Besides, there are many acts in his career, and many parts of his poems, which it is impossible not to condemn if we are to have moral judgment at all. And yet we feel that a judgment of this sort would be a false one. \"What's done,\" Burns has himself said, \"we* partly may compute, but scarcely what's resisted.\" We are sure that any judgment passed upon such a man must be untrue, unless we take full account of what Burns was in himself, and this is just what it is quite impossible fully to do; so the world proceeds exactly like a court that empanels jury after jury, and examines again and again all the old witnesses, and gets a verdict. sometimes one way and sometimes. another, with which it is never satisfied, for in a very little while we have all the old process gone over again \u2014 spots in Ayr county \u2014 many a pleasant meadow and winding stream, many a castle noted for historic events in the \" brave days of old;\" but nothing is so striking as the fact that Burns was bom here, and that it was here he lived the best and freshest years of his life. The world has interest in Ayr and bonnie Doon and the castle o' Montgomery, and some half dozen other spots, because Burns has described them. Their existence in his verse is wider and deeper, whilst it is as lasting and as true, as their natural existence. There will be a complete fitness, then, if, in talking of these scenes, we associate them with his name. Of Burns himself there are many biographies, and these treat him in all sorts of ways \u2014 most of them apologetic and laudatory, as Currie's and Gilfillan's; a few cold and sneering, as Principal Shairp's; oneortwo judiciously discriminative, like Alexan- der Smith's. It is one of those stories for which the world has a great appe- tite \u2014 an appetite so great that there never seems to be enough to satisfy it. There is in it the old tragedy of human life: power and genius striving against adverse circumstances, internal and ex- ternal ; an existence blighted almost ere its prime, the pathos that misfortune and misfortunes alone give. Yet the world, with its old desire of stoning the pro- phets and building their sepulchres, has never been quite able to make up its mind as to the life of Burns. Were it a necessity that this should be done, we are not anxious to maintain that the ver dict would be altogether a favourable one. For now the poet cannot die, Nor leave his music as of old, But round him, ere he scarce be cold, Begins the scandal and the cry.

If one were asked to name the first and chief merit of Burns, it would be his spontaneity and force. There is always a certain glow and fire about his wit The history of the various pieces tells us this; like so many little Minervas, they all sprang fully armed from the head of this creative Jove. They were thought of, composed, and written all at once, and there, so far as Burns was con cerned, was an end of them. We shall have something to say of \"Tam o' Shan ter\" presently ; but it may be well here to quote the account of its composition, in order that the remarks we have made may be illustrated by this reference to so long a poem. \"To the poet's intercourse with Captain Grose we owe this admir able tale.

To this Grose agreed, provided the poet would undertake to supply a witch story, to be printed along with the engraving. The poem was the work of a single day. Mrs. Burns, who distinctly remembered the circumstances, afterwards related them. Burns had spent the most of the day in his favourite w-alk by the river, where, in the afternoon, she joined him with some of her children. He was busily engaged crooning to himself, and Mrs. Burns, perceiving that her presence was an interruption, loitered behind with her little ones in the broom. Her \"atten tion was presently attracted by the strange and wild gesticulations of the bard, who now, at some distance, was This poor inhabitant below. Was quick to learn and wise to know, And keenly felt the friendly glow And sober flame ; But thoughtless follies laid him low And stained his name. After every allowance has been made for Burns, it still must be said that not \u2022even the greatest geniuses are freed from the duty of obedience to the ordi nary rules of morality, and hence it might be as well, on some grounds, if we could retain the poetry, and forget the life. This is, however, quite impossible. The world will always wish to know something of its great men, and in this case, so many of Burns's writings spring from the circumstances of his personal history, that a knowledge of these cir cumstances is necessary to him that would read with due understanding. The plan of this book will enable us to sketch a few of the scenes in Ayr and Dumfries with which Burns was con nected, and to say something upon a few -of the poems which arose from them, without requiring us to dwell on the graver and sadder aspects of the theme. As for these poems themselves, their prominent characteristics are known to all who have read them, and who has not ? There is the passion that burns .and palpitates in each line of some of the love songs, as in \" Yestreen I had a pint o' wine, a place where body saw nae,\" there is the wild, mad, rough mirth of the \"Jolly Beggars,\" the peaceful and reverent tenderness of a piece like the \"Cotter's Saturday Night\" \u2014 albeit, this piece is just a little over praised, the critics having gone into ecstasies of delight over Burns on the few occasions when he has shown a disposition to be a good boy \u2014 and still more of \"Highland Mary.\" Where else can we find love"], [216, "PLCTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 200 seen to be greatly agitated. He was reciting very loud, and with the tears rolling down his cheeks, those animated lines which he had just conceived, to the heart. They are read and sung by thousands who might be supposed to care little for poetry, and, at the same time, they never fail to charm the most highly educated. \" Of all poets,\" says Alexander Smith, \" Burns was perhaps the most directly inspired. His poems 'Now Tam! O Tam, had they been queans.'\" One other incident completes this sketch. The verses were committed THE BRIGS OF AYR. to writing on the top of a sod-dyke over the water; when finished, Burns came into the house, and read them immedi ately, in high triumph, at the fireside. did not grow \u2014 like stalactites\u2014 by the slow process of accretion; like Adam, they had no childhood \u2014 they awoke complete. Burns produced all his great effects by single strokes.\" Here the question meets us, What would have been the effect on Burns's poetry if he It is this spontaneity that gives Burns's poems their chief charm. Written straight from the heart, they go straight"], [217, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 201 had been highly learned, and rich and comfortable f He was fairly educated as it was, but had he been what we may call a scholar, the loss would have been grievous. Even works of the high quality of Milton's sonnet would by no means have compensated for \" Scots wha hae,\" or \"My love is like a red, red rose.\" The intellectual quality, though different, might yet have been as high, still its application would have been less wide. The rich man might have had an addition to his flock, but the poor man would have been without his one ewe lamb. Then as to his life, it is plain that if he had been comfortable and prosperous we never could have heard such strains \u2014 comfortable and prosper ous men never write like this. The passion that blazes in his song was the very same that wrecked his life. If he was to write so divinely, he had to pay a severe penalty for the privilege. When mere mortals drive the horses of the sun, they must expect to be struck by the thunderbolt. What might be considered as defects had an important effect as giving width to his work. Burns was not a man of firm and rooted con victions in religion, or politics, or life. He had a sort of attachment to the new lights, and a sentimental prefer ence for the Stuart and Jacobite cause, because he had some notion that his ancestors had been concerned in it. But though he was a patriot, and was profoundly sincere when he wrote these lines, yet they express almost the only permanent feeling he had. With this general changeableness of opinion there was combined the strong passion that allowed him to feel strongly on one side of a subject for a time, and then to feel just as strongly on what was quite the other side. He was thus fitted to describe every varying phase of Scot tish life. Those who would attack the national faith on account of its hypocrisy, and those who would defend it on account of the simple and honest lives of those that hold it, may alike draw their inspiration from his pages. \"The Holy Fair,\" and \" Holy Willie's Prayer,\" might give many a biting line to the one, whilst the \"Cotter's Saturday Night \" would furnish a magazine of apt quotation to the other. We find Burns writing passionately in favour alike of Jacobites and Jacobins \u2014 two very inconsistent sides surely. His life was the best education that could possibly have been given to one whose destiny it was to write the brief, passionate songs which, under the name of Burns's Poems, are now one of the most precious literary treasures of the world. The circumstances of it were such that he was again and again stung into passion ate rage \u2014 that through his whole life his spirit was never free from the application of bitter and continued caustic. It was then, when the furnace was heated seven fold, that the molten mass was cast out. In a word, swift, direct, passionate force was the characteristic of Burns's poetry, and the circumstances of his life and nature were such as to stimulate passion and keep his mind at fever heat during his whole career. Merely from the artistic point of view we are not afraid to assert that the best possible life which Burns could have lived, if we consider the work he did as the only thing to be thought of, was the life he actually didi live. This is, we are well aware, not the only side of the question. For all this wild excitement a terrible reckoning had to be paid. Mad excesses were followed by fits of deepest despondency, Even then a wish \u2014 I mind its power \u2014 A wish that to my latest hour Shall strongly heave my breast \u2014 That I, for poor auld Scotland's sake, Some usefu' plan, or beuk could make, Or sing a sang at least. The rough bur-thistle, spreading wide Amang the bearded bear, I turn'd the weeder-clips aside, And spared the symbol dear : No nation, no station, My envy e'er could raise : A Scot still, but blot still, I knew nae higher praise.

O Burns ! another name for song, Another name for passion \u2014 pride ; For love and poesy allied ; For strangely blended right and wrong. I picture you as one who kneeled A stranger at his own hearthstone, One knowing all, yet all unknown, One seeing all, yet all concealed. The fitful years you lingered here, A lease of peril and of pain, And I am thankful yet again The gods did love you, ploughman ! peer ! In all your own and other lands, I hear your touching songs of cheer, The peasant and the lordly peer, Above your honoured dust strike hands. O sad sweet singer of a spring, Yours was a chill, uncheerful May, And you knew no full days of June, You ran too swiftly up the way, And wearied soon, so over-soon, You sang in weariness and woe ; You faltered, and God heard you sing, Then touched your hand and led you so, You found life's hill-top low, so low, You crowned its summit long ere noon. Thus sooner than one would suppose, Some weary leet will find repose. It were better if, in describing Burns's life, his biographers had confined them selves to a full statement of facts, and had not thought themselves compelled to enter into a disquisition of the pros and cons of all his doings. None save Burns himself ever fully realised the difficulties of his position, because none but Burns himself could ever possibly know all the circumstances of the case. In the accounts which we shall now give of some picturesque scenes to which his genius has added a lustre and a glory not their own, it is fortunate that we shall be able to keep away from the most disagreeable incidents. The Pand of Burns. Scenes of His Early Life in Ayr. \" \u2022j.y^p&N .*-. NEAT, clean, one-story house\" at Alloway, K- IsiWi.

What might have been an inference from probability in one guide, is by his succes sor considered something much more de finite. Byanotquite uncongenial destiny, the cottage was afterwards long used as a tavern. The adjacent country is rich beyond what is usually found in Scot land. It is finely wooded, and there is many a variety of hill and dale to charm the eye. In the distance there was always the background of hills, for so it is in every Scottish landscape, and here \"the ridges of Arran haunt Ayrshire,\" so perpetually are they present to the eye. The various hills and streams, and kirk-s was constructed. It consisted of two rooms, one of which had the rare luxury of a fireplace, instead of the usual hole in the roof. It is now enlarged, as another room has been built at the west end, so that we do not see it exactly as it was at that date. The birth took place in the second of the two original"], [219, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 203 and castles, were probably not very widely known at that time; but Doon water, which runs quite close, is now as famous assmooth-slidingMincius crowned with vocal reeds; and Alloway Kirk, and Mossgiel, and the Castle of Mont gomery are familiar to men in all lands. These are objects that are permanent monuments to the poet, but of course much of what was purely personal to him has disappeared; thus it is only by imagination that we can construct the greater part of the furniture of the cottage. It must have been very plain and simple. The \" box-bed,\" the antique eight-day clock, a chest of drawers, a plain rough table, some wooden shelving for dishes, and a few chairs. It was here that, on the 25th January, 1759, Burns was born, as he himself says \u2014 infant, and why not our northern poet also ? Nature was not so kind to the poet as the gipsy woman was. A fearful storm arose just after his birth. In the dark winter morning, before .t was light, the gable ofthe cottage came smashing down, and the mother and child had to be conveyed through the darkness and storm to the friendly shelter of a hut as kindly and as rude as their own. When the poet was seven years old, the family removed to Mount Oliphant, a farm of seventy-five acres, to the east of Doonholm House. The place is on a slope at two miles distance from the bridge of Doon. As it has some little elevation, it commands a wide view of the surrounding country. Below it the Doon flows tothe sea between its famous \" banks and braes.\" Beyond Ayr there is the wide expanse of the Firth of Clyde. The mountains of Arran rise up boldly at the back of the picture, whilst a dim line of blue on the horizon marks the distant Argyleshire hills. We know well enough that the poet saw and felt all this beauty. We have the trace of it in his verse. But there was something else to do besides gazing at the land scape, and rolling the poetic eye in a fine frenzy. The soil was hopelessly bad, and so was the weather, and, as a still further addition to their burdens, they were pestered by an unreasonable factor. Hard and hopeless drudgery was the lot of the poet, boy as he was, and of his father and brothers. It was here that he began his intellectual and his poetic education, for at the mature age of 15 he fell passionately in love with \"a bonnie sweet sonsie lass,\" as he describes her in a letter which is much simpler and finer than most of his prose compositions. \"Indeed,\" he continues, \"I do not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her when returning in the evening from our labours, why the tones of her voice made my heartstrings thrill like an \u00c6olian harp; especially why my pulse beat such a furious ratan when I A blast o' Janwar' wind Blew hansel in on Robin. The birth ofthe poet was not wanting in various signs. Just before the event, his father had done some trifling act of service to a gipsy woman by conveying her across a ford which the storms of winter had rendered impassable save to men on horseback. She was afterwards entertained in the humble cottage, and when the child was born she inspected his palm anxiously, and prophesied, if we may believe the poet, as follows : \u2014 The gossip keekit in his loos, Quo she, wha lives will see the proof, This waly boy will be nae coos; I think we'll ca' him Robin. He'll hae misfortunes great and sma', But aye a heart-aboon them a' ; He'll be a credit till us a' \u2014 We'll a' be proud o' Robin. But sure as three times three mak nine, I see by ilka score and line, This chap will dearly like our kin', So leeze me on thee Robin.

When visiting St. Margaret's Hill, the residence of Dr. Laurie, one of his ministerial friends, he was asked to stay to dinner. He accepted, and the meal proceeded. But the \"minister's man\" had disappeared, and the meal had to proceed as best it could, the diners helping themselves. When the repast was finished, and Burns gone, the miss ing functionary at once reappeared on the scene. He was interrogated by his master as to the reason of his absence, and at once replied, \" I was just fleyed to come in, for fear Burns should mak a poem o' me.\" looked and fingered over her little hand, to pick out the cruel nettle stings and thistles.' So he honoured handsome Nell by the first song that he ever wrote. It was fitting that the peasant poet should first sing the peasant girl. The poem itself is poor enough when compared with \"Mary Morrison,\" and there is no touch in it of the solemn tenderness of \" Highland Mary ; \" but though he called it \"puerile and silly,\" it at least contains the promise of better things. After Mount Oliphant, Burns's father removed to Lochlea, in Tarbolton parish, and the scene of his musing was now transferred from the banks of the Doon to those of the Ayr. The scenery about Lochlea is, in many respects, the same as that about Mount Oliphant. The background is identical, and the foreground is formed of much the same materials. Yet, as this is an upland farm, there is just a little more wildness in the landscape ; but it was here that Burns first mixed with his fellows in social intercourse. The neighbouring village of Tarbolton had a dancing school, w'hich Burns attended, and this opened up opportunities for making a great number of acquaintances among the girls who frequented it, and this led to a number of love affairs, during which, says his brother, \"the agitations of his mind and his body exceeded anything of the kind I ever knew in real life.\" He successively fell in love with the whole female population of the village of loveable years, and conferred on each of them immortality by the glowing songs which he composed in their honour. But it was not only love songs that he wrote; and several of the people who here and afterwards had the mis fortune to encounter his displeasure, were gibbeted for ever in some bitter, sarcastic rhymes. \" Even the gods cannot recall their gifts.\" Burns could not blot out what he had once written, and it is therefore easy to understand how those who thought themselves likely Kirkoswald and Irvine were places of transient interest in his life ; but the chief event that next calls for men tion in connection with the scenery of Ayrshire, is his occupation of Mossgiel, begun in March, 1784, after his father's death. Burns certainly was unfortunate in his undertakings. \" Their new home,\" says a biographer, \" was a bare upland farm, 118 acres of cold clay soil lying within a mile of the Mauchline village.\" Burns had been losing money for some years, but here he determined to make up for all that had gone before. He w*as to toil, he determined, till the horizon of his prospects looked very different from what it did now. But \" it is not given to mortals to command success,\" and happy would it have been for Burns if, whilst remembering this, he could have continued the quotation, \" but we'll do more, Sempronius, we'll deserve it.\" For some time, indeed, he did deserve it, and, as he says, in \" spite of the devil, the world, and the flesh, I should have been a wise man; but the first year, from unfortunately buying bad seed \u2014 the second from a late har vest, we lost half our crops; \" and so obstacle after obstacle seemed put in the way of poor Burns's desperate struggles towards respectability and competency Near Mossgiel is the village ofMauch-"], [221, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 205 line, to the ladies of which he has addressed the humorous lines begin ning\u2014 poem and supplies the last rhyme, is, at least, unexpected. The whole, though rude, is not without a certain vigour. Burns has made this obscure Scottish village and its inhabitants of the period famous enough, however. He was here from twenty-three to twenty-eight, and his rapidly matured genius was then at its brightest. A number of events hap pened here which called it forth. \"It w7as,\" says Dr. Chambers, \" the scene of the 'Holy Fair,' and of the 'Jolly Beg gars.' Here dwelt his hosts, John Dow and Nanse Tinnack. His mistress, Jean Armour, was one of the ' six proper young belles' of Mauchline, whom he celebrates. He proposes to meet Lapraik at ' Mauchline race,' or Mauchline fair. Its minister was the unfortunate Daddy Auld, whom he has characterised so ungently, and one of its elders was that Holy Willie into whose mouth he has put so remarkable an exposition of rigid Calvinism. And here was the residence of his friend, Gavin Hamilton, to whom he inscribes a dedication, and whose friendship was unquestionably one of the most important circumstances of his early life.\" But these are only a few of the great poems which belong to this period. Against certain modes of church life he was exceedingly bitter. There was a reason for this. He had an encounter with the session, from which he emerged by no means in the trium phant fashion mentioned in the epistle to Thomas Walker, an epistle which, for drollery, depth of humour, wild fun, and (we are obliged to add) grossness equals anything in Rabelais. \"The Ordina- tion,\" the \"Twa Herds,\" belong to this period and place, and the \"Cotter's Saturday Night,\" though its centre pic- ture was drawn from the memory of his dead father, also belongs to this time. We have already said that we consider this last poem to be somewhat over- praised, and we have indicated the reason why it is so. Yet it is well for Burns that he wrote it. Like the rest of the human Oh, leave novels, ye Mauchline belles, Ye're safer at your spinning wheel : Such witching looks are baited hooks, For rakish rooks, like Rob Mossgiel. Ofthe parish and town before Burns's time, not much is to be said. The parish itself is in the centre of Ayr. It is high lying, but flat, with but one eminence\u2014 Mauchline Hill, and one loch, Lochbroun \u2014 which, in the \"New Statistical Ac count,\" is given as covering sixty acres. The one river in the parish is the Ayr. \"In its course it passes between rocks of red freestone from forty to fifty feet high.\" There are many fine \"bits,\" we may well believe, on a river like this. In this rock there are a number of caves, one of which is said to have been a retreat of Alexander Peden, the Cove nanter. A traveller in the lowlands of Scotland, soon finds that Wallace and Peden divide the caves between them. The only historical event that seems to be connected with this parish is a battle, or rather skirmish, at Mauchline Moor, between the king's forces and the Cove nanters, in which the latter were suc cessful. There is a monument to five Covenanters at \" the town head of Mauchline on the Green,\" which re places an older tombstone. The curious inscription has been preserved, and it bears witness that Mauchline had a poet before Burns : \u2014 Bloody Dumbarton, Douglas and Dundee, Moved by the Devil and the Laird of Lee, Dragged these sive men to death with gun and sword, Not suffering them to pray, nor read God's word, Owning the work of God was all their crime, The eighty-five was a saint-killing time. The collocation of the devil and the Laird of Lee is quaint, whilst the general reflection which concludes the"], [222, "206 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. race, Burns was rather fond of com pounding loved to recline.\" The spcnce, or best room, in which he describes himself as receiving the vision, as rooms then went in that district and class, had some pretensions to comfort ; but it was a mere act of politeness on his part to receive the muse in the best room. He did not live there, but in the stable loft, an apartment in which it was impossible to stand upright. The furniture was a bed and a table, and in the table there was a drawer, and this contained writings of which the originals are now worth many times their weight in gold. Most of them were written on the table, and the heap inside the drawer accumulated from day to day, till, in one of the darkest hours of Burns's life, he was induced to draw them forth and publish them. This is the famous Kilmarnock edition, which contains the most celebrated of his poems, with one exception. It is scarcely probable that many poems have met with such a reception ; what poem is ever published now, indeed, that thrills a community ? \" Old and young,\" says a cultivated observer, \" high and low, grave and gay, learned or ignorant, were alike delighted, agitated, trans- ported. I was at that time resident in Galloway, contiguous to Ayrshire, and I can well remember how even plough boys and maidservants would havegladly bestowed the wages they earned most hardly, and which they wanted to pur chase necessary clothing, if they might procure the works of Burns.\" Then fol lowed the chain of events that removed Burns to Ellisland, in Dumfries, and Ayrshire was his home no more. \" For sins he was inclined to By damning those he had no mind to.\" He was certainly not inclined to hypo- crisy, or to too great austerity of life, or to be too severe on the shortcomings of suffering humanity. Hence he saw keenly the faults of Scottish Calvinism, and exposed them with trenchant power. The objections to it as a system are summed up in the briefest and most emphatic manner \u2014 with somewhat of the suppressio veri, we admit \u2014 in \" Holy Willies Prayer;\" and the \"Holy Fair\" may be taken as an example of the abuses to which that system, when it began to be worked out in practice, was liable. Burns also had the \"personal dealings\" of the minister and session with him to avenge. It is the more to his credit, then, that even at this time he could acknowledge what was true and good in the religion of his country, and could embody it in a fine poem, which, if not of the very first order from a purely poetical point of view, yet bears unimpeachable testimony to the profound reverence and respect which lay at the bottom of the poet's heart, and which, even in the worst hour, were never en tirely banished from his nature. Mossgiel itself is all one rich memory of Burns. \"A lane near is said to have been a favourite walk of the poet; the field in which he turned up the mouse's nest with the plough is pointed out, and a tree is shown underneath which he"], [223, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 207 \"he Pand of Burns, Scenes of some of His Great Poems HERE are many through and through one. And then the selling of the corn does not take nearly so long as the performance in its less matured condition ot one of the in numerable operations that go to make up the occupation of the farmer. How delightful, too, if the sales have gone better than we expected, and we find ourselves at evening with a little more hard cash in our pockets than we counted on. \"Tam\" has done this, or he is in company with others who have; but now all the corn has been long sold, the farmers have refreshed themselves and discussed each other's affairs, and are preparing to get their horses ready, and perhaps they urge \" Tam \" that it is time to go. They have, indeed, many things to urge that are undeniable enough, and \" Tarn's \" conscience tells him they are right. Does he not know all the difficulties of the homeward way, for the short winter day is already beginning to darken ? does he not re member that he faithfully promised his good wife Meg this morning, when he started from Shanter, that he would re turn before dark, and there is just time for him to fulfil his pledge ? and hark to that ominous whistle in the wind! surely he does not wish to ride home through a stormy and moonless night.

No, no, Tam was not for home, for on this special night, had he not got planted unco' right? of Burns's poems which make ex- cellent topographi- cal commentaries on localities. The picture may not always be complete; but such of it as exists is vivid and life-like. Of these poems, by far the most celebrated is \"Tam o' Shanter.\" This does not belong- to the Ayr, but to the Dumfries period of Burns's history; but t.ien it is all about Ayrshire scenes and folk. There is no mistaking its intense localism. Perhaps it was all the better for being written a little way from the place. Such pictures are cleaner cut when seen from some distance, and there is a greater chance of their being better art work. The opening scene is laid in Ayr. When chapman billies leaves the street, And diouthy neibours, neibours meet, As market-days are wearing late, An' folk begin to tak the gate ; While we set bousing at the nappy, An' gettin' sou and unco happy, We think na on the lang Scots miles, The mosses, waters, slaps, and styles, That lie between us and our hame. Here, with a few touches, we have the picture of a Scotch small country town on market day. It is quite easy to amplify and fill out the sketch, without improving it, though we are afraid. At such a day, those who have worked all the week through by themselves on the upland farms, now find a change of business that in itself is a recreation. It is winter, and it is much better argu ing on the price of corn than following a plough all day, with the wind cutting Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely Wi' reaming swats, that drank divinely And at his elbow, Souter Johnny, His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony ;"], [224, "208 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

Kirk-Alloway is approached the storm seems to increase; and what terrible sight is this within the Kirk? as Before him Doon pours all his floods ; The doubling storm roars thro' the woods ; The lightnings flash from pole to pole ; Near and more near the thunders roll ; When glimmering thro' the groaning trees, ICirk- Alloway seem'd in a bleeze ; But as the poet tells us, \" nae man can tether time or tide,\" and so the jovial company had at last to part. It may be an irascible dame also demanded Souter Johnny's presence at home, or that the landlord wished to shut up, or that Tarn's money was all done, but at any rate he did depart. Just at mid night, Maggie, most famous of horses, was brought round to the door, and Tam mounted and set off through one of the worst storms on record, with the thunder crashing every minute in his ears, the lightning flashing in his eyes, and the rain coming down in perfect buckets. Tam sat close on his steed, and \"skelpit\" right on, with his bonnet over his eyes, and humming a verse of a tune to himself; but he could not help thinking of the traditions connected with the various landmarks he passed, and certainly these were not cheering. Thus he could hear, when the storm lulled for a minute, the roar of the burn that crossed the road, and he could just catch a glimpse of the tumbling mass of water by the lightning, before his guid mare Meg was up to the middle in it. Ah, but it was here that, in a former winter, the chapman had perished, and there, too, was the \"muckle stane\" where \"drunken Charlie,\" perhaps re turning home in the same reckless fashion as himself, \" braks neck bane.\" At that small group of trees a \" murdered bairn \" was found once, and near, too, he knows, is the thorn where Mungo's mother laid violent hands upon herself. But now the deeper roaring of a greater flood is in his ears, for the Doon is before him, and, as old Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, And loud resounded mirth and dancing Not, indeed, that this Alloway Kirk is any grand old monastic pile, but simply an old parish church that had gone to decay. Tam knew, or could have known, the history had he cared, of \"the two bare walls, one story in height, with triangular gable ends, in one of which the old Kirk bell\" was still to be seen. It was easy to remember that this once had been a parish, but that now it was but a part of Ayr, and he might have reflected that even the neglected burial-place was almost un used now, and that really there was nothing to fear. But how could Tam be got to believe any such stuff of that sort ? Did he not remember all the stories that had been told about the place, deserted alike by the Christian living and the Christian dead, given up as a retreat to all foul spirits; and then could he not plainly see, through the few trees, in at the open spaces which Time had made in the walls of the ruined building, the most horrible, unearthly, and hellish revelry ? \u2014 for on this fearful night all sorts of unclean spirits were holding a very witches' revelry, and at A winnock-bunker in the east, There sat auld Nick in shape o' beast ; A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, To gie them music was his charge : He screw'd his pipes and gart them skirl, Till roof and rafters a' did dirl. \u2014 Coffins stood round like open presses, That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses ; And by some devilish cantrip slight, Each in its cauld hand held a light."], [225, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 209 But was Tam alarmed ? Not a bit. Why, he stopped his frightened horse, that would have hurried on at a quick pace, for Maggie had a good deal more sense than her master on this special night, and sat there actually enjoying the horrible ings of one Nannie \u2014 a lately admitted novice to the secrets of the black art \u2014 so that at last he could contain himself no further, but gave vent to a loud roar of approval !

No doubt he was a sadder and a wiser man, but at any rate he was by no means home yet, nay, he had to pass through the whole extent of Maybole parish, and a good bit of Kirkoswald, before he came to Shanter, a farm which lies on a slope overlooking Shanter Bay. Now this Shanter Bay was the very centre of the smuggling district, and there might have been enough drink here to have satisfied him. Besides, Souter Johnny usually dwelt at Glenfit, and how he was to put up in Ayr, unless he had remained there alto gether, does not appear ; moreover, there wras a public-house quite close to him. Thus the potations of \" Tam ' and \" Souter Johnny \" at Ayr are clearly seen to be inexcusable, and the fright of the former well deserved. We are glad to know, however, on Burns's own authority, that poor Maggie, as she stood without her tail in the High-street of the local metropolis, was an \" awful warning to the Carrick farmers not to stay too late in the Ayr Market.\" Ane spring brought off her master hale, But left behind her ain grey tail.

We seem justified in thinking so. Certainly this is the most, perhaps the only ethereal and spirituclle love that Burns ever hail. There is nothing ofthe fleshly, or ofthe earth, earthly, about it. It is all pure and serious and tender \u2014 passionate enough, it is true, but a very different sort of passion from -'Yestreen I had a pint of w7ine.\" We do not even know how the lovers met, nor how often. But we do know that Burns had persuaded her to marry him, and that she went to her friends in Argyleshire for a time to pre pare for the union. We must suppose her, at least, to know nothing of Jean Armour and the Mauchline alehouses. Before they parted they spent a long day together in these woods about Coilsfield, and they threaded the mazes of the burn till it brought them to the larger waters and more imposing banks of Ayr. Before they took what was to be a final farewell of each other, they went through a curious ceremony. They selected some small rivulet that joined the main stream near where they stood, and stationed themselves on opposite sides. They wet their hands with the water, and, holding a Bible between them, they swore to be true to each other. They parted. Mary went to Argyle, and in October came south to meet Burns. At Greenock she fell ill and died, and \" w7as buried in a dingy church- yard, hemmed by narrow streets \u2014 beclanged now by innumerable hammers, and within a stone's throw of passing steamers\" \u2014 the saddest spot in that hideous town ; worst of all there is in that coal and iron district. The news was brought to Burns at Mossgiel, and this was the monument that he raised to her memory, so that she \"sepulchred in such state doth lie, that kings for such a tomb would wish to die\" : \u2014 Green be your woods, ard fair your flowers, Your waters never drumlie ! There simmer first unfauld her robes, And there the langest tarry ; For there I took the last fareweel O' my sweet Highland Mary ! How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk, How rich the hawthorn's blossom ; As underneath their fragrant shade, I clasp'd her to my bosom ! The golden hours, on angel wings, Flew o'er me and my dearie ; For dear to me as light and life, Was my sweet Highland Mary. Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace, Our parting was in fu' tender ; And, pledging aft to meet again, We tore ourselves asunder : But Oh ! lell death's untimely frost, That nipt my flower sae early ! Now green's the sod and cauld's the clay, That wraps my Highland Mary ! O pale, pale now, those rosy lips, I aft hae kissed so fondiy ! And closed for aye, the sparkling glance, That dwelt on me sae kindly! And mouldering now in silent dust The heart that lo'ed me dearly ! But still within my bosom's core, Shall live my Highland Mary. With most of Burns's love affairs, it was true that out of sight meant also out of mind, but that was not the case here. Three years afterwards he expressed his emotion, in the only way he could, by laying another stone on her cairn. It was the anniversary of the day when he heard of her death, and it was then that he sang that song : \u2014 That sacred hour can I forget, Can I forget the hallowed grove, Where by the winding Ayr we met, To live one day of parting love ! Eternity will not efface Those records dear of transports past ; Thy image at our last embrace ; Ah ! little thought we 'twas our last .'

His house was burnt down during some careless ness arising out of a New Year's cele bration. A prose writer of fiction \u2014 not unworthy to be named after Burns as a delineator of Scotch life and manners \u2014 John Galt, was born here. Those who have read the \" Ayrshire Legatees,\" and the other works of that writer, will remember the many allusions to local spots of interest in these charming works. The birds sang love on every spray \u2014 Till soon, too soon, the glowing west Proclaim 'd the speed of winged day. Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes, And fondly broods with miser care !

Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast ? There are some points of interest about the name of Coilsfield, which \u2014 as it is connected with a curious tradition often referred to by Burns \u2014 we may notice. This middle part of Ayrshire \u2014 more emphatically the land of Burns- is called Kyle, the same name as Coyl, or Coil, or Coilus. This it derives from an ancient monarch of the Britons : \u2014 One of the most famous of Burns's songs is connected with rather a curious incident in his life. On the Ayr, at about two miles from Mossgiel, are the braes of Ballochmyle. \"Bending* in a concave form, a mixture of steep banks and pre cipices,\" says Chambers, \" clothed with the most luxuriant natural woods, while a sine river sweeps round beneath them, they form a scene of bewildering beauty, exactly such as a poet would love to dream in, during a July eve.\" The property had remained fora long course of years in the possession of an old Ayrshire family of the name of White ford. Burns, with or without permission, was very fond of wandering in these parts, and he knew and sympathised with the sorrows of the family. One of them, called Maria, seemed acutely pained at the separation, and Burns has written a charming song on this theme, in which the lady's name is introduced. The grounds passed to a gentleman named Alexander, who had been in the West Indies, and shaken the Pagoda tree to some purpose. Burns met his daughter, Miss Whilmena Alexander, the \" Lass o' Ballochmyle.\" It was one summer evening when this young lady, \"distinguished by every g-race, both of mind and person, walking out along the braes after dinner, encountered a plain lookingman in rustic attire, whoappeared to be musing, with his shoulder placed 'Twas in that place o' Scotland's isle, That bears the name o' Auld King Coil, \u2014 as we have it in \" The twa dogs.\" This Coil once went to war \u2014 at some period between The Flood and the Christian Era, in the B.c.'s anyhow \u2014 with Fergus I., King of Scots. Coil was defeated, slain, and buried on this spot. The whole surrounding district carries traces of a great battle. The rivulet that falls into the Faile is called the Bloody Burn; the Dead Man's Holm is the name of an adjacent field ; a circular mound, surrounded with two huge stones of a very ancient appearance, is shown as the exact spot of burial of the jovial though unfortunate monarch. It was cer tainly some place of sepulture of an ancient race, for urns with dust have been found in it. '\u2022* The little town of Irvine has rather a melancholy name in the Burns history, for it was there that he himself said he acquired habits which were the cause of all his subsequent suffering. He resided here for a brief period before he went to Mossgiel, and was engaged in business"], [230, "THE BRAES OF BALLOCHMYLE, AYRSHIRE. 2I4"], [231, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 215 NT against one of the trees.

The most famous in Burns's life is the Doon. Near it he was born, and spent the early years of his life. Ii is mentioned in many of his songs. especially in the charming \"Ye banks and braes o' Bonny Doon ; \" it is crossed by that famous brig, by passing the middle of which, just in time, Meg saved Tam o' Shanter. It flows right across the county.running from Loch Doon to the sea, and sepa rating Carrick from Kyle. Loch Doon is bounded by Kirkcudbright and Ayr, and is situated among wild mountains. The riverwindsfrom thelake bya natural fall; but this was changed by some of the grasping proprietors, who constructed some artificial sluices, and half drained the loch \u2014 with little profit to themselves. one is pleased to know. At one end of the loch is a castle, which was occupied by Edward Bruce during the war of independence. The Doon river is eigh teen miles in length, and for a part of the way, after leaving the loch, thunders along between lofty cliffs. It then be comes tamer, but as it approaches the haunts of the poet, it assumes a beauty less wild, but more pleasing than in the upper part of its course. It is to this part that the song refers \u2014 a song so well known that we can only venture to quote the first verse : \u2014 T\u00ab as even \u2014 the dewy fields were green, On every blade the pearlies hang ; The zephyr wanton'd round the bean, And bore its fragrant sweets alang : In ev'ry glen the mavis sang, All nature list'ning seem'd the while, Except where greenwood echoes rang, Among the braes o' Ballochmyle. She knew Burns by reputation ; but his reputation was then a very bad one. In addition to various moral backslidings, he was committing that heinous crime of being poor and unsuccessful, which is the one thing the world never forgives, so she probably thought the letter a piece of impertinence ; at any rate, she never answered it. The girl showed afterwards a sort of poetical contrition for her fault. Burns became famous, and the family at Ballochmyle found, to their profound astonishment, that he was more likely to confer favour by noticing them, than they could confer favour by noticing him. The original manuscript ofthe poet was carefully sought out, and the lady used every means to accentuate the interview as time rolled on, and the fame of the poet, and the note of his song, became wider and wider known. Many years after Burns was dead, she pointed out, \"as nearly as she could recollect, the exact spot where she met the poet, in order that it might be dis tinguished by an appropriate ornament in *the fomi of a rustic grotto, or moss- Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon, How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair ; How can ye chant, ye little birds, And I sae weary fu' o' care ; Thou'll break my heart thou warbling bird, That wantons thro' the flowering thorn : Thou minds ine o' departed joys, Departed \u2014 never to return. This has brought us to just where we started, or very near it. And, having completed a sort of charmed circle, we must pursue the remaining scenes of Burns's life in a different county. house.\" Ayrshire, in thegreenwest, mayalmost be said to be a land of streams, so many"], [232, "216 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

Friars' Carse, Lincluden Abbey, Dumfries itself wereall in the immediate neighbourhood, and the porary places of residence we take little account in these sketches, His visits to Edin burgh have been already briefly commented on. His border and highland tours have also occasionally metour notice; but two places still remain for special notice, and Nith, as was natural, appears again and again in his verse.- Perhaps he may have shown special tenderness for a river that they are both in Dumfries-shire. At Ellis land he made a final desperate attempt at life as a farmer; at Dumfries he spent the last few years of his life. There he died ; there he was buried. owed its birth to Ayr. The water that flowed past his house door had come from his native hills though, the distance was hardly great enough to allow him to indulge, without some sense of the ridiculous, in such senti- mental reflections. Besides, he had in truth something else to do. He had very hard work before him, and he knew it. Had his verse not been so absolutely spontaneous, it would have ceased alto- gether. But the \"Castalian font\" in him was no inert mass of water that had to be laboriously pumped up be- fore it could be available, but a strong bubbling stream that would occasionally find its way out, despite of all obstacles. Burns engaged in this undertaking, during one of those brief gleams of prosperity that seemed to shine with almost devilish mockery at intervals in his life. He had made some money by his poetry. He had married Jean Armour, and no doubt intended to be a model husband and husbandman. Farming was the only calling he knew, and it was natural that he should apply himself to it. So he took this farm from Patrick Millar of Dalswinton. Tiie lease, as is still the case with farms in Scotland, was for nineteen years. The Not very far distant from the place where Burns spent his first years, the river Nith takes its rise in the very hilly parish of Cumnock, in the Kyle division of Ayrshire. It flows north-east for some distance, enters the county of Dumfries in Kirkconnel parish, and continues its course south-east, flowing through the whole extent of the county, past the town of Dumfries itself, and finally into the Solway Firth. Five or six miles above Dumfries the banks \u2014 partly covered with broom, and partly shaded with trees \u2014 rise somewhat abruptly from the stream. A little way behind the bank is the house that Burns built for himself and his wife, and around it is the territory that comprises the farm of Ellisland. Of all the places where Burns had yet stayed, Ellisland was by far the most beautiful. It looks across the stream, and is so near to it, that, when the shadow of the house lengthened with the depart ing day, it was thrown across the fields on the other side ofthe river \u2014 there pure"], [233, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 217 farm was a tolerably large one, more than one hundred acres, but it was wild and unimproved ground \u2014 the buildings and offices on it too wretched even for the modest requirements of a Scottish farmer of the last century. The tenant had got the land cheap, on condition that he was to do all the building at his own cost. It was a place where a man was likely either to \"make a spoon or spoil a horn,\" in the words of the old Scotch proverb. Some men would have left it with a considerable competency ; many others, perhaps the majority, would have left it as Burns did \u2014 a sadder and a poorer man. The steward of the proprietor reproached Burns at the time for having made \" a poet's, not a far mer's choice,\" and, fair as is the prospect about Ellisland, and harmonious as is the name, it was not a fertile spot \u2014 at least, not with such appliances as the agriculturists of the time had. It was an additional misfortune that the soil was not of the same nature as that to which the poet had been accus tomed; it was light and sandy, whilst his former farm had been wet and clayey. Then there was his usual ill luck with the seasons, which were not favourable, and the fact that he had not sufficient capital. Moreover, he had ob tained a place as exciseman, at fifty pounds a year. An addition of nearly one pound a week, utterly independent of bad seasons, too, was no doubt very desirable. Burns himself thought he had done \"not bad for a poet,\" but unfortu nately he did not reflect that while engaged at this work he could not be attending to his farm, and that his regu larity of life would be quite destroyed. It is also to be said that his fondness for company tempted him many a time away from home. Alas, the calling of a poet and farmer does not go well together in these parts. His destiny was cast in no Sicilian valley, where he could pipe and watch the distant flocks at his leisure ; where the earth and the nymphs were equally charming and kind, and where nature smiled with perpetual wel come, but amidst scenes where the land and the people were equally hard and stern, and where all the conditions were of quite another kind. Though poetry did not interfere with his daily bread making, yet the fame it had procured him did. Every now and then a stranger came to see this natural pheno menon, and this was so much waste cs time, and unsettling. He was welcomed into every convivial company, far and near, and we can understand how strong the temptation was to \"drown dull care,\" if for one short night, in the cup that cheered because it inebriated. It is not to be supposed that Burns was any mere idle drunkard. Had he been a use less loafer, less interest would be taken in him, however great his genius. It is be cause he was, on the whole, making pas sionate efforts to do well, and all in vain, that the gloom of the last years of his life seems so sad. Burns w7as already very well known. It was not three years since the Kilmar nock edition had appeared when he went to Ellisland; but the effect had been instantaneous. Burns's poems impress a man when he first reads them, or they never impress him at all. They had impressed the world, were already widely read, and were daily growing in favour, so that \"Robert Burns, the poet,\" was a man whose doings it was even then thought worth while to observe. So it happens that we have the most minute records from all sorts of people about this Ellisland life. We have it as it appears in the eyes of fellow poets, of fellow farmers, of travel lers, literary men, and men-servants and maid-servants. The picture is a jum bled and yet very interesting one. Let us pick out a scrap here and there. But first, a word as to the house. It was to have been built with its back to the stream. This would have perhaps been more convenient for farm purposes, but"], [234, "218 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. Burns would not hear of such a thing. So the \"simple parallelogram of one story in height, about sixty feet long, by eighteen in breadth,\" which formed the dwelling, faced the Nith, and com manded the fine prospect of the woods of Dalswinton. \" From the front of the house a pathway winds down the bank, towards a little slip of holm, here left by the river, a spot where children rejoice to weave rush caps and begem the thorn with the govvan, and lasses 'use to wash and spread their claiths,' as old Allan has it. Halfway down the pathway, a copious spring spurts out into a basin for the supply of the family with water.\" There were four chief rooms in the house, besides some closets. One of these, with \" a pleasant window to the east,\" was the ordinary sitting-room of the poet ; though it was out of doors, in direct communion with Nature, that all his great works were composed, and that some of them were written. In the stackyard he thought of that solemn hymn to \" Mary in Heaven,\" and on a seal dyke adjacent, beseated astride-leg, and in a perfect passion of triumphal glee, he cast out \" Tam o' Shanter.\" his horse through the hills to spend an evening in some distant place, with such friends as chance threw in his way.\" Some unexpected points in his character meet us here. These were repeated to after biographers by the servants whom Burns at this time kept, who \" thought him to be as good a manager of land as the generality of the farmers. in the neighbourhood.\" He was kindly and considerate to his servants, was rarely angry, never without just cause, and then it was soon past. There was one thing that Burns could not endure, and that was any sort of cruelty, or even carelessness, in the treatment of the lower animals. It put him in a perfect frenzy of passion. Once a servant girl so carelessly pre pared the food for one of the cows, that the poor animal was nearly choked in swallowing it. This was the only time the servant saw him really angry. \"His looks, gesture, and voice were terrible, so that the girl vvas glad to get out of his sight.\" Had it been a man who had offended him. Burns would probably have given the careless one still worse treatment. During his Ellisland life he was out one morning cutting grass by the side of the Nith, when he heard a shot, and \"presently a little wounded hare came hopling by me. You will guess my indignation at the inhuman fellow who could shoot a hare at this season, when all of them have young ones.\" He sought \"the inhuman fellow\" out, and threatened him with a ducking in the river. He, however, took a deeper and a more poetic revenge. The poor hare did not perish \" unhonoured and unsung,\" for Burns commemorated this incident in a poem, one of the finest he has composed in the purely English dialect. The last verse has always seemed to us peculiarly charming: \u2014 Oft as by winding Nith, I, musing, wait At the building of the house he him self worked hard. \" If he saw us,\" said one of the workmen, \" like to be beat wi' a big stane, he wad cry, ' Bide a wee', and come running. We soon found out, when he put to his hand, he beat a' I ever met for a dour lift.\" Here we have the picture ofa day's doings, drawn with a somewhat original, if not unfriendly hand: \u2014 \"He was ever on the move, on foot or on horseback. In the course of a single day, he might be seen hold ing the plough, angling in the river, sauntering with his hands behind his back on the banks, looking at the run ning water, of which he was so very fond, walking round his buildings or over his fields, and if you lost sight of him for an hour, perhaps you might see him returning from Friars' Carse, or spurring The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn, I'll miss thee, sporting o'er the dewy lawn And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless late."], [235, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 219 Principal Shairp has said of Burns's bacchanalian songs, that, however good they may be as poetry, yet their moral effect has been bad \u2014 they have helped men a step on the way to destruction. Without pausing to discuss the truth of this, and the question of Burns's culpa bility in the matter, we may at least urge that his poetry on animals and natural objects \u2014 the field - mouse, the hare, the faithful horse and dog, na}7, the daisy and the thistle \u2014 has tended to fill the minds of the humblest and rudest men with respect and care for the lower animals.

The great motive for exertion was taken away. He had, on the whole, made a brave fight of it up to now ; but it was of no use. Some mysterious agency seemed to baffle all his efforts. He must now simply swim with the tide. There was, unfortunately, no doubt as to the way the tide did run. The opportunities for convivial meeting were only too frequent, and they were largely taken advantage of. As to Dumfries itself a few* words may be said. It is situated pleasantly enough on the left bank of Nith. On the banks of a beautiful river, and with a fine neighbourhood of hills and woods and meadows, it may well deserve the title of Queen of the South, or capital of the South of Scotland. Its early origin vvas a castle and a church, but by the thirteenth century it was already a Royal Burgh. It vvas at the altar of the church that the assassination of the Red Comyn took place. The story how Bruce struck the first blow, and how, when affrighted at the deed and the place where it was committed, he rushed agitated from thechurch, and informed his savage followers, and how one of them, exclaiming, \" I mak siccar,\" rushed in and despatched the unfortunate man, is well known.

There were many reasons for it. Burns had \"come down in the world ; \" he vvas no longer a tenant farmer with a number of servants in his employ; he vvas a subordinate government official. The change was not a comfortable one for him. If he had not been used to large houses at any period of his life, he had yet been used to open air surroundings. He could step from his door to the banks of some beauti ful stream or grassy field. He had, in fact, lived in the country all his life, and now he was to live in a town with none of the alleviations which town life is capable of, and without which it is a very poor business indeed. True, he had now a settled income, small as it was, but even this vvas not without its disadvantages. \"Tine heart, tine a',\" says the Scotch proverb. Nothing that Burns could do would now improve his position. He had the mechanical duties of his office to fulfil, and il he rose at all"], [237, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 221 every raid of the English it vvas exposed to attack ; hence the burghers were well suited to keep \" watch and ward,\" and they assembled at the call of their Provost as readily as a Highland clan under its chief. Some memories of this old hatred caused it to offer a stubborn resistance to the union of the kingdoms in 1 707, and its citizens passively allowed a party of Cameronians to burn the Articles of Union at the cross. In the '15 and '45 Dumfries, like the other low land towns, stood up for the Presbyterian and Hanoverian interests, and suffered severely. Its later years tell the ordi narystory of Lowland Scotland'ssteadily increasing and uneventful prosperity. The most remarkable monument of the past in Dumfries is the old bridge which crosses the Nith. It vvas built by Devorgilla, mother of John Balliol, the same who founded the monastery of Grey Friars. \"This remarkable structure, believed to be the oldest bridge in Scot land, consisted originally of thirteen arches, with a barrier in the centre; but for some years they have been reduced to six, and the bridge is now only crossed by foot passengers.\" A small Scotch town is not the most pleasant place to live in by any means. The one virtue known or appreciated is orthodox re spectability, whilst poverty is the great crime. The narrowness and hardness of the Scottish nature, its want of the softer graces of life, its tendency to exaggerate small matters, and elevate maxims of secondary importance to the place of moral laws, are all seen at their worst. Burns in various ways \u2014 in some of which he vvas to blame, in others not \u2014 did not conform to therequired standard. So, although the Dumfries folk were proud of him in a sort of way, it was hardly possible that they could get on comfort ably together. In a word, what hap pened there was something very natural, and of very frequent occurrence when two men not on the same plane meet. Burns was eminently superior to the people with whom he associated in cer tain very obvious respects; he vvas also somewhat lower than they were in some almost as obvious respects. It vvas only natural that lie should be chiefly oc cupied in considering the points in which he was superior to them, and they the points in which they were superior to him. The chief events of his last years may be passed briefly over. \"The curse of country towns,\" it has been vvell said, \" is the partial and entire idleness of large classes of the inhabi tants. There is always a cluster of men living on competences, and a greater number of tradesmen, whose shop duties do not occupy half their time. Till a very recent period, dissipation in greater or less intensity vvas the rule and not the exception amongst those men, and in Dumfries at that time the rule held good.\" Into this company Burns came, and here, as elsewhere, he vvas much sought after, and we can imagine the scenes of dissipation which, again and again repeated, did so much to wreck the peace of his mind, and wrought such injury to his constitution. Still, let us not exaggerate. Burns was no worse in this respect than the rest, and at any rate he was always able to go about his duties. In politics -Burns had turned a violent Jacobin. He had no very deep-seated political convictions, but he was disheartened, and he vvas a poet, and, like all the best poets in Britain, hailed the outbreak ofthe French revolu tion with passionate joy. He stuck to his faith longer than the rest, and vvas more violent in its expression. He shocked the respectabilities ofthe day terribly by his outspoken and vehement denuncia tions of tyrants and kings and govern ments. Nay, he bought some small cannon at the sale of the effects ot a smuggling brig which he himseL had been the foremost to capture, and sent them to the French Convention. They never reached their destination, but were seized by the government, and an"], [238, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 222 and joined Burns, who, on his proposing to cross the street, said, 'Nay, nay, my young friend, that's all over now,' and quoted, after a pause, some verses of Lady Grizzel Bailie's pathetic ballad: \u2014 inquiry made into the matter, which resulted in a severe reprimand ad dressed to Burns, and perhaps consider able damage to his prospects of promo tion, though this is by no means certain. When the war really broke out, Burns became a volunteer, and wrote a song for the corps full of poetic fire, and at the same time sound common sense. We quote the two first verses : \u2014 Does haughty Gaul invasion threat? Then let the loons beware, sir ; There's wooden walls upon our seas, And volunteers on shore, sir. The Nith shall run to Corsincon, And Criffel sink in Solw.iy, Ere we permit a foreign foe On British ground to rally ! O, let us not, like snarling tykes, In wrangling be divided : 'Till slap come in an unco loon, And wi' a rung decide it. Ee Britain still to Britain true, Amang oursels united : For never but by British hands Maun British wrangs be righted. His bonnet stood once fu' fair on his brow, His auld ane looked better than many ane's new, And now he lits't wear any way it will hing, And casts himself dowie upon the corn bing. O were we young, as we once hae been, We sud hae been galloping doun on yon green And linking it ower the lily while lea ! And winna my heart light I wad dee. It was little in Burns's character to let his feelings on certain subjects escape in this fashion. [We must say we think it was of the very essence of Burns's character to give passionate expression to the mood of the moment.] He immediately, after reciting these verses, assumed the sprightliness of his most pleasing manner, and taking his young friend home with him, entertained him very agreeably till the hour of the ball arrived.\" Burns's sentimental Jacobitism would have disappeared like mist when he heard that the foreign foe had landed on Scottish soil. The Dumfries part of the poet's life had some still darker blots; but enough on this disagreeable sub ject, of which the most has been made in his later biographies, and of which, in luture times, the story will be again and again related. Let us draw one picture from Lockhart of the darkest days ofthe Dumfries connection: \u2014 \"A gentleman of that county has often told me that he was seldom more grieved than when, riding into Dumfries one fine summer's evening about this time, to attend a county ball, he saw Burns walking alone, on the shady side of the principal street of the town, while the opposite side vvas gay with successive groups of gentlemen and ladies, all drawn to gether for the festivities ofthe night, not one of whom appeared willing to re cognise him. The horseman dismounted Towards the close of his life it seemed as if the gloom would clear away. His promotion seemed sure, and perhaps, in prospect of it, the respectabilities of Dumfries were again beginning to smile, if somewhat coyly, upon him. Had he lived a few more years he would, per haps, have died in prosaic comfort, but for good or ill, it was not to be. The summer of 1796 saw him dying. \"At this crisis the faithful wife vvas laid aside, unable to attend him. But a young neighbour, Jessie Lawers, sister of a brother exciseman, came to their house, assisted in all household work, and ministered to the dying poet. She vvas at that time only a girl, but she lived to be a wife and mother, and to see an honoured old age. Whenever we think of the last days of the poet, it is well to re member one who did so much to smooth his dying pillow.\" So, justly remarks Principal Shairp, Burns wished to re ward her. He had but one gift; but"], [239, "THE LAND OF BURNS. 223 that was immortality. The girl's name will be known as long as his songs are sung. One, in special, of exquisite beauty, he addressed to her. Princi pal Shairp has sneered at the form of expression, which is the usual one of a lover to his mistress. The objection is not so just as Dr. Johnson's criticism on Lycidas. It is the fine compliment of a poet to a young girl. The song is a diamond without flaw. The central idea is the expression of help given to the loved one, and this idea is expressed in four different and yet similar ways, so that they all tend to strengthen the con ception. Like so many of Burns's songs, we require to know the circumstances under which it was written, before we fully appreciate it. The remembrance that it was the girl who, in reality, was protecting him, only makes it more pathetic. on the 14th July. Pie was evidently dying. Some money difficulties had hastened the end. According to the com mon story he was threatened with legal proceedings. If Mr. M-Dovvall's version, given in his carefully-compiled \" Burns in Dumfries- shire,\" be true, this vvas not exactly the case, and the matter was a misunderstanding on Burns's part. Still, he thought himself in difficulties, and had to apply to friends for money. The appeal vvas promptly responded to, with offers of other assistance, but it vvas not needed ; the end vvas very near. On the 2 1st of July, 1796, Robert Burns died in a sort of delirium, muttering curses on the lawyer whom he believed to be threatening his last hours. Jessie Lawers still faithfully tended him, for Mrs. Burns vvas not to do any work. Other faithful friends were there, and his eldest son vvas present to close his eyes. Not an altogether unblest death was that by which \"he passed from the judgment of Dumfries and made appeal to Time.\" Death vvas kind to his fame, whatever it vvas to him. Over Dumfries a change came, when it vvas known that Burns vvas passing away. The towns people began clearly to see that some thing that had made their town remark able vvas being taken from them. It would be unfair to say that their sorrow vvas selfish. At such a time, the better elements of human nature come forth. The crowds that pressed round the kindly physician, and retired sadly when they heard there vvas \" no hope,\" felt that some one specially near and dear to them vvas dying. One man, \" with much simplicity,\" asked who would be their poet now. Who indeed ? What saccr vales would now touch Nith and Drum lanrig and Lincluden with a light more glorious, more spiritual than that of the material sun ? What Dumfries felt, Scotland felt, and feels to this day \u2014 mingled emotions of pride and shame and sorrow at the mention of the name of Robert Burns. Oh, wert thou in the cauld blast, On yonder lea, on yonder lea ; My plaidie to the angry airt, I'd shelter thee, I'd shelter thee; Or did misfortune's bitter storms Around thee blaw, around thee blaw, Thy bield should be my bosom, To share it a', to share it a'. Or were I in the wildest waste, Sae black and bare, sae black and bare, The desert was a paradise, If thou wert there, if thou wert there ; Or were I monarch o' the globe, Wi' thee to reign, wi' thee to reign ; The brightest jewel in my crown, Wad be my queen, wad be my queen. At the end of June he went to the little hamlet of Brow on the Solway. One touching story is told of a visit he paid there to the manse. The sun was shining in his eyes, and one of the family seeing it, tried to adjust the blind so as to prevent this. Burns saw it, and said, \" Thank you, my dear, for your kind attention, but ah 1 let him shine, he will not shine long for me.\" He returned to Dumfries, after a fortnight's absence,"], [240, "224 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. In well-known lines Shakspeare has his ashes, and Burns monuments and memorials are plentiful enough through out Scotland. These we have not noticed. His best monuments are the streams and places he has sung. The names of Doon, of Aston, and of Nith recall his surely and inevitably. The day of his birth is kept as a day of festival by the innumerable Burns Clubs which meet to do his memory honour. It is right and proper that this should be. The monuments of various kinds have not been imposingly conceived, or executed in the highest sty le of art, and the convivial meetings on Burns's birthday may be made the occasion for senseless carnival ; but in their own place and time, both testify to the feelings of gratitude and respect with which Scotchmen regard his memory. And yet if some unex pected fate should gift Scotland with another strangely mixed spirit such as his \u2014 with another Robert Burns in short \u2014 would she treat him differently? Would we not see again the old tragedy of which the first act is the starving and the neglect, and only the last the building of the sepulchre and the monuments? said \u2014 The evil that men do lives after them ; The good is oft interred with their bones. Surely this is not the case with Burns. There are some things in his writings which we might wish unsaid, but these are few and far between. How little the dross, how great and fine the gold ! He has enriched the literature of the world with many and valuable additions ; he has quickened the love of country in all Scotchmen, for those who read his poems (what Scotchman worthy of the name has not?) under the Southern Cross, orin distant backwoods, seeagain rise be fore them the dear remembered features of their native land ; he has quickened the kindly sympathy of men for one another, and for the dumb creation. These are merits that might outweigh more faults than ever Burns committed. Such, as we now know it, is the judgment of posterity ; who can venture to say that this judgment will ever be reversed ? Dumfries contains a somewhat gaudy and pretentious mausoleum, erected over Two Stories of Ayrshire Castles. \u25a0 would tain say more of Ayrshire did our limits permit us to do so, for even had Burns never lived, its \"castle walls\" and \"summits famedin story \" would have given us occasion for many a tale of love and war. But we must content ourselves with a selection of two stories, in both of which (there is a touch of the chief incidents, somewhat out of the common run. They are both .con nected with the Cassilis family : one with their residence on the Doon, the other with Dunure Castle, on the coast near the bold headland known as the heads of Ayr. The beautiful little green hills called Cassilis Dowanis, near the first, were celebrated as the haunts of the fairies, as is mentioned in the opening of \"Halloween\" : \u2014 Upon that night, when fairies light On Cassilis Dowanis dance. grotesque, and which are, in their And, appropriately enough, the story we"], [241, "225 DUNURE CASTLE This fragment ofa past age stands on a rocky eminence, and forms an interesting and promi nent object in the scene.

Here, also, Allan Stewart, Commendator of the Abbey of Cross raguel, was roasted before a slow fire by Gilbert, Fourth Earl of Cassilis, to extort his surrender of certain lands.

The gipsy vvas irrepressible, and the Johnnie Faa, or Sir John Faa, as he seems to have called himself, about whom our tale is, and whom we may sup pose to have been a descendant of this \"Earl of Littil Egipt,\" vvas, without doubt, the most irrepressible of his tribe. He was wandering with a set of his companions about the \" banks and braes o' bonny Doon,\" when he chanced to come near Cassilis House. It vvas at that time in the possession of John, sixth earl of Cassilis. He was a devoted adherent of the Covenant, and at this very time was away from home attending the meeting of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, and engaged in the theo logical discussions that accompanied the drawing up of the confession of faith. At home vvas his wife \u2014 fair and young, and giddy and thoughtless \u2014 no fit com panion for this stern old Calvinist. Johnnie Faa very soon learnt the state of affairs, and, of course, he vvas just the person to take advantage of it. We are inclined to think he threw himself in the lady's way as she took her walks about the castle, and by all sorts of plausible tricks and devices, got her to listen to his tale of love. But, according to the ballad that narrates the event, the process was very much simpler: \u2014 There is a vvise proverb to the effect that, if you give an ill name, even to a dog, you may as well hang him at once. Even modern civilisation has failed to reclaim the gipsy, and certainly the savage old Scotch rulers were by no means inclined to try. To a serious people like the Scotch, there vvas some what inexplicable in these wild wander ers utterly without purpose. They were something antagonistic to the national life. However split up that has often been, each of the sections has always had some definite aim before it, after which it strove with might and main ; but here was a part of the world's inhabitants who cared for nothing that the rest of Scotland cared for. The Scots were not a people to ponder dreamily over this phenomenon ; they lumped the race with \"sorners, broken men, bards,\" and\" other sic like runners about,\" and summarily declared the full vengeance of the law against them. And yet these people managed, in some sort of a fashion, to struggle on till even the law vvas forced to recognise them. Thus, probably with some notion of putting them under the control of a responsible person, James the Fifth issued a writ in favour of \"Johnne Faa, Lord and Earl of Littil Egipt,\" clearly recognising a sort of feudal jurisdiction over the rest of his race in Scotland \u2014 if not according to the laws of the realm, at least \" conform to the lawis of Egypt,\" though what these were does not appear. The gypsies cam to our gude lord's yett, And O, but they sang sweetly ; They sang sae sweet, and sae very complete, That down cam our fair lady. And she cam tripping doun the stair, And a' her maids before her ; As sune as they saw her weel-laured face, They cuist the glamour ower her. \" O come wi' me,\" says Johnnie Faa, \" O come wi' me, my dearie ; Johnnie does not seem to have exercised his power vvell, for, in 1624, he and some of his companions, forcibly described as \"vagabondis, sorneris, common thieves, callit, knavvin, repute, and holdin Egipti anes,\" were caught, tried, condemned, For I vow and I swear by the hilt of my sword, That your lord shall nae mair come near ye.' Thus the ballad tells us how the whole set were invited in, my lord's cellar was"], [243, "TWO STORIES OF AYRSHIRE CASTLES. 227 laid under contribution, and there vvas exchange of gifts, of which the lady's were, as we may vvell believe, by far the most valuable: \u2014 of the sufferers, which concludes the ballad:\u2014 And we were fifteen well-made men, Although we were na bonnie, And we were a' put down but ane, For a fair young wanton lady. \u00abw> Then she gied them the red red wine, And they gied her the ginger ; But she gied them a far better thing, The gowd ring frae her singer. Here, while one is forced to admire the candour of the confessor as to per sonal appearance, one cannot help noting that it was somewhat unfair to lay the blame on the bew*itched lady. \" Put down,\" the reader will observe, is a sort of euphonistic expression for a process quite the reverse. \" Gae, tak' frae me this gay mantil, And bring to me a plaidie ; For if kith, and kin, and a' had sworn, I'll follow the gypsy laddie. \" I'll mak a hap to my John;e Faa, I'll mak a hap to my dearie ; And he's get a' the sash gaes round, The countess, according to the story, vvas kept in confinement for the rest of her days, and the earl consoled himself with another wife. By his disgraced spouse he had two daughters, and one of them became the wife of Gilbert Burnet, the famous bishop of Salisbury. As there is no mention of the extraordi nary incident which we have recorded in any authentic document ofthe period, it has been reasonably conjectured that the whole story is a fabrication, and we confess it does look uncommonly like it. The ballad probably gave rise to the story, and we are told that it vvas invented to annoy that excellent prelate, who, like other good men, had many enemies. It was certainly not a proper story to be told about the relatives, even though only by marriage, of a dignified ecclesi astic. And my lord shall nae mair come near me ! \" So off went Johnnie Faa and the fair ladye in the very best of spirits. But the story is not yet done. They were no sooner out of sight, than, contrary to all expectation, the earl, who vvas supposed to be engaged on the \" reasons annexed \" at Westminster, suddenly turned up at the castle-gate, and, very naturally When our lord cam hame at e'en.

In England, the lands of the old Church were seized, in due form, after Act of Parliament. In Scot land the process was much more violent. This nobleman is described as \" ane particular man, and ane very greedy Before that I either eat or sleep, I'll gae seek my fair lady.\" The capture vvas surely and speedily effected just as the fugitives were cross ing the Doon, and the whole party returned at once to the castle.

He had almost got a conveyance from the abbot of the first of them, when, to his intense chagrin, the priest died before the deeds were signed. He vvas not to be done, however ; but persuaded a monk of the same abbey to forge the abbot's signature. Then, fearing that the monk might divulge the business, he hired \" ane certain carl to stick him,\" which, being accomplished, he got the \"carl\" hung for theft, and so, says the narrator briefly, \"the lands of Glenluce were conquest.\" He imprisoned and tortured in Dunure Castle the Com mendator of Crossraguel till he had forced him to sign deeds, handing over the property to him, and by these violent means very speedily increased his estate. The Covenanters, Their Character^ URNS has given us of human kindness, and who would never have thought of retorting on their persecutors in kind the injuries which were inflicted upon them. They have, again,- been represented as a set of sense less fanatics, who followed neither right nor sense, but only their own mad notions. Both these are over drawn pictures. It has been reserved for our own time to acknowledge the merits and the demerits of these re markable men, and it can justly be said, that after every deduction has been made, the verdict of history must be em phatically in their favour. In treating of this period there is some necessity for caution. The fires that then glowed are not yet quite extinct. Nay, as long as Scotland is Scotland, they cannot be. The great bulk of the Scottish people are Presbyterians, and are likely to re main so. They cannot but regard with favourable feelings those who in evil days preserved that form of faith, and who willingly sacrificed their lives for its maintenance. The very gratitude they feel forbids them to be rigidly jut,t. They must be, and it is highly honourable to them that they should be, rather ad- four brief, some what rough, yet emphatic lines, which describe alike the effect of 'the Solemn League and Cove- nant on Scotch history, and the manner in which it ought to be regarded : \u2014 The Solemn League and Covenant Cost Scotland blood, cost Scotland tears, But it sealed Freedom's sacred cause : Ii ihou'rt a slave, indulge thy sneers ! The south-westpart of Scotland \u2014 Wig ton, Ayrshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Dum fries, part of Lanark \u2014 is specially the home of the Covenanters, and as we are now treating of the regions there abouts, we shall devote some attention to this remarkable episode in Scottish history, It may be as well to preface our remarks with a few reflections as to the character of these men. False pic tures are often drawn of them. They are represented as a set of meek and mild, and, we are afraid, rather namby-pamby enthusiasts, overflowing with the milk"], [245, "THE COVENANTERS. 229 vocates than judges. If, however, we forget for a moment the particular creed which these men maintained, and ask ourselves what human virtues they can justly be credited with, we shall still be able to say much. Theirs vvas the virtue of faithfulness, untiring en durance, heroic courage. Their lives were consecrated by a strict devotion to what they believed to be truth and duty, and these lives were, in the great majority of cases, absolutely blameless from a moral point of view. They were industrious, peaceable, law-abiding men, who were forced from their ordinary call ings and ways of life by the most cruel persecution. What, then, can be said on the other side ? They were, it may be alleged, narrow and fanatical, sour and gloomy. Toleration was as unknown to them as to their opponents. They were impracticable and unreasonable. They would have deprived the national life of all grace and poetry and romance. They condemned the most innocent amuse ments as heinous crimes. Such, in sub stance, is what is said against them. P'rom the charge of hypocrisy it is not, we presume, necessary to defend them. Hypocrisy can do a great deal, but it has never yet so far counterfeited real feeling as to suffer torture and death with a cheerful countenance. Al though they were called hypocritical by their opponents at the time, yet what was really meant was that they were fanatical. Leaving this charge as too ridiculous to merit serious attention, we may ask what is to be said of the others. They are to a great extent true. That type of character which we call the covenanting had these failings. They are the common failings of human nature, specially of Scotch human nature when irritated by long-continued in justice. The cheerful aspects of human life do not naturally occur to a set of men who are fined and taxed and wor ried, and liable to be tortured and hanged for doing certain things which they are perfectly convinced they ought to do. Nor could toleration be reason ably expected of them. It vvas as yet not professed by any large body of men ; it was not the creed of the government of the day. In treating of their special faults, it would be absurd to accuse them of things that were part of the com mon creed of the time. Their vehemence and unreasonableness were to be re gretted. They were very vehement, and in extreme cases almost ludicrously unreasonable. It is the fault of their race to be intensely eager and in tensely narrow, to see things from an extreme point of view, to have little sense of perfection or justice. Yet it is remarkable that the one or two men who were called at that day \"latitudinarian,\" by which everything that vvas most horrible vvas meant \u2014 men whose writings seem to us now to pre sent such a charming contrast to the heated outpouring of their contem poraries; men who were accustomed to weigh, balance, and consider; who believed that a question might just possi blyhavetwosides, and that tofind honesty in an opponent was within the bounds of probability \u2014 such men never had any influence on the life of the time. Even if they did interfere in state affairs, they were soon carried away by the current, and very speedily forgot their principles in practice. To take one example from English history, where was there a man so far in advance of his age as Sir Thomas More ? He has left us in the Utopia the finest maxims about religious toleration, and that he vvas high-minded, sincere, and honourable, we know from the all-convincing fact that he vvas be headed for refusing to acknowledge the king's supremacy over the church. And yet he vvas a worse persecutor than Cromwell, who might be fairly consi dered a mere expediency man, without deep principles or settled convictions. Theviewwehavegiven ofthe character ofthe Covenanters is one thatis, we think,"], [246, "230 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. now accepted. It is the view adopted even by those in Scotland who cannot be supposed to be unduly favourable to them or their creed. Dean Ramsay, in his interesting and well-known \"Re- miniscences of Scottish Life and Charac- ter,\" has generously said: \u2014 -'Religious differences cannot quench the national feelings ofa Scotchman towards the piety and the stern sincerity of Presbyterian Scotland. Nor will any Scottish Epis- copalian \u2014 even the most attached to his own form of polity and worship \u2014 ever fail to pay his tribute of respect and ad- miration to the old Scottish Elder of a simpler creed, or ever cease to feel a Scotchman's national pride in the stern and unbending piety of men who main- tained, at the hazard of life and property, the Covenant which they had signed with their blood. We feel assured that such feelings and such emotions are, in their tendencies, favourable to the human character.\" Another member of the same communion, the late Mr. John Hill Burton, in his famous \"History of Scotland,\" has given us what seems the best account ofthe Covenanters that has ever been written. Naturally of a judicial turn of mind, and possessing the enor mous advantages of a complete legal training and experience, Mr. Burton brought to his task the exact qualities that were required. Even in his descrip tion ofthe extremest sects, he is careful to avoid contempt or harshness of judg ment, and he has always pointed out the sterling qualities that give a softer shade to the picture. But it is from an even more eminent Scottish Episcopalian that men will always take their views, not merely of the Covenanters, but of most of the outstanding points in Scottish history and life. The Waverley novels are part of the literature of the world, and two ofthe most famous \u2014 \"Old Mortality\" and \"The Heart of Midlothian\" \u2014 are specially devoted to the representation of this phase of the national history. There are many things about these two remarkable works worthy of notice, and most of all, the power they show to enter into modes of life and thought with which the writer could not have very much sympathy. Scott vvas a Tory of the Tories. He vvas inordinately proud of his connection with the \" bauld Buccleugh,\" though he vvas certainly worth more to mankind than all the other members of that noble family put together; and he had such a respect for the \"majesty that doth hedge a king,\" that he positively wor- shipped that peculiarly gross and com- monplace idol, George the Fourth, and the brief dedication of his series of novels to that monarch is, perhaps, the only part of the Waverley novels that cannot be read with pleasure. Pie was an attachedEpiscopalian, and altogether his sympathies were with the cavalier, aristocratic, Stuart elements of Scottish history, and not at all with the Presbyte- rian, democratic, and popular. Yet it is from him we get Jeanie Deans, the noblest type of womanhood in his pages. He was like the Abbot in his \" Lord of the Isies,\" or, to take a still more striking instance, like the prophet of old, that vvas brought to curse Israel, and whose curses changed into blessings when he saw the host of God stretched out before him. Yet, favourable as Scott's view is to the Covenanters as a whole, it has never been received with entire approval in his own country. The learned and able Dr. McCrie, in his review ofthe \"Tales of my Landlord,\" attacked the great magi- cian as if he had been guilty of gross in justice, and a devout carpenter once told us, that though, when he had once begun \"Old Mortality,\" he was unable to lay it aside till he had finished it, yet many of the passages made his '\u2022 bluid boil,\" because of the way in which men of whom the earth was not worthy were spoken of. There is just a soup^on of truth in this. Scott did not leave his prejudices entirely behind, and he has dwelt rather strongly on one or two of the more ludicrous aspects of the"], [247, "THE COVENANTERS. 231 matter, as, for instance, the adventures of Mause and Cuddie Headrig, whilst to those who have always considered Claverhouse as the very impersonation of the evil one, it may be disagreeable to see him represented as a hero, which, notwithstanding his daring courage, he hardly was. This much may be ad mitted. And yet how admirably do these side-lights fill in the picture. Cud die Headrig must have been the repre sentative of a great number of people, perhaps of the majority of the population of that day. Nay, Cuddie is something more, he is a very fair representative of what the mass of people must always be. Impressed by the stronger and higher spirits that have moulded the faith of his country, he is willing to re ceive, and does receive, that faith with unquestioning acquiescence; but his still deeper creed is that it is his first duty to keep a whole skin and enjoy an easy life, and, though quite believing that the Covenant is right, yet he is prepared to renounce it with but little compunction. Nor can it be said that the examples of what we may fairly call fanaticism, given in \" Old Mortality,\" are at all overdrawn. We have already given an account of the assassination of Archbishop Shairp, and the spirit in which the perpetrators of that cruel deed, and the population generally, regarded it. After Shairp's crime, we cannot express any very great amount of regret for his end, and admit that in this case something might be said to mitigate the judgment which history and morality must always pass upon as sassinations ; but the desire to split the last remnant of a remnant upon the question as to whether it is lawful to pay toll, in passing over a bridge or ferry, to the representatives of an \" uncovenanted king,\" is an historical fact which must be admitted to be as extreme as any thing Scott ever described. The charac ter of Davie Deans neither is, nor is intended to be, one of Scott's highest characters. There is too much alloy in the gold for that. Yet both in its merits and defects it is profoundly true to Scotch life. There is the reverence for truth, the perception of the sanctity of just deal ing, and the earnest endeavour to be just and exact in all his relations towards his fellowmen, and the punctual perform ance of the duties which he considered he owed to his Maker. There is, on the other hand, the profound conviction that he and his sect\u2014 if sect it can be called \u2014 are in the right, and everybody else in the wrong, and the accompanying profound and scarcely concealed satis faction therein, which is so true a \" note \" of Scottish religious life \u2014 that feeling which is well expressed in the quaint old rhyme \u2014 That a' the warld may plainly see, That nane are in the richt but we O the auld Scottish nation. There is with it all the keen business tact, the belief in and reverence of worldly prosperity. Nothing is truer than the change that comes over his opinion of Butler when he knows of his advance ment in worldly prospects, through the good graces of the Duke of Argyle. Of the character of his eldest daughter much might be said, but this is the chief point. Such a character is not one that can bulk largely on the stage of history. Such a being must always \"dwell among untrodden ways,\" and be one whom \"there are few to praise, and very few to love.\" Yet it was not merely because Scott had a true story to work upon that he has given us this picture ; the story would have been as true to life as it is had he invented quite of himself the incident upon which itis founded. His knowledge of the period, of Scottish history, of Scottish character, convinced him that such beings did exist, although their life must have always been a hidden one, and from the fulness and certainty of this knowledge he constructed the finest portrait in all"], [248, "232 PLCTURESQUE SCOTLAND. his writings. The peasant girl has as high a sense of duty as her father, but it is of a purer and more refined de scription, and it is totally unmixed with the alloy of baser motives. Innocence, purity, courage, devotion, a fine sim plicity, reverence, and affection, are the elements ofwhich such a character is com posed. It is not without reason that we must always regard this peasant maiden as a real, rather than a merely ideal creation ; because she is the representa tive of that which actually existed. there might be much loyalty to a commander, and personal devotion to a prince. It is akin to this that the Cavaliers, with all their dash and bril liancy, were liable to be unsteady, care less, indifferent, and \u2014 we must say \u2014 immoral. It vvas the rigid performance of duties that gave the other side strength. Even in far later times, when the persecuted men of the \" anti-Popish, anti-Prelatic, anti-Erastian, and anti- Sectarian, true Presbyterian remnant of the Church of Scotland,\" as they called themselves, were no longer perse cuted, and were so reduced in strength that but one or two in a fairly sized town remained to bear testimony, it was found that men who might be laugh able, through quaintness of opinion and an objection which they stubbornly re tained to the most innocent enjoyments of life, were yet acute and able mana gers of business, rigidly punctual and honest in all their dealings ; and so people learned to respect men whose word was never known to fail, and against whose name there was no sus picion of reproach. It was also sometimes found that the strange, antiquated ways and uncouth modes of expression had not destroyed, though they had covered, pro found depths of tenderness, which,. though not easily moved, yet once reached never failed, and some learned first to respect, and then to love, that which the first inclination had been to ridicule and pass by contemptuously. Scott's treatment of the other side suggests a reflection. May it not be said that the one is as deserving of our admiration as the other? The Cavaliers were as daring and devoted as the Co venanters. They afterwards showed themselves quite as faithful to a de feated and hopeless cause as their oppo nents, and if they were cruel and blood thirsty, would not their foes have been the same if they had had the opportunity ? There is a certain amount of truth in this, but there is also a good deal of error. Equal bravery we must in fairness allow to both sides ; equal en durance, and almost equal loyalty. But in motives and morality the two characters were widely different. Even when most fanatical, the Covenanters acted from a sense of duty. As Burns finely said of himself, the very light that led astray was light from heaven. There is certainly no appearance of what we call principle on the other side, though"], [249, "THE COVENANTERS. 233 The Covenanters. Their Histoi\\y. S it is our intention only to present a few scenes con- nected with theCovenanters, it will be advisable, for the sake of clearness, that we should first present the whole history of the Cove- nants in one distinct and brief view, so that the act, for to the people of that day \"black prelacy \" vvas almost, if not quite, as hateful as Romanism. Copies of the Covenant were signed by the noblemen and gentlemen who had come to the capital to concert measures for the safety of the national religion, and by the inhabitants of the town generally. The spot for meeting was the churchyard of the old Greyfriars. The place was probably chosen merely for convenience; men are not given to think of stage effect at such times, and yet it was admirably fitted for effect. The Cove nanters were standing on the graves of men who had rendered themselves famous in the history of their country. At their feet lay the Grassmarket, which had been the scene alike of gay pageants and of gloomy executions. Before them, on the other side of the ravine, towered the Castle Rock, with the grey buildings that crowned it, whose history, fully written, was the history of Scotland. The very wall that bounded the ground on which they stood had its own heroic and pathetic history. It was the wall that the citizens of Edinburgh had thrown up after the defeat of Flodden, when, deprived at once of king and provost and fellow burgher, they had not given way to despair, but had at once proceeded to take every measure to defend their country. If the subscribers could have seen what vvas yet to happen, it might not have turned them from their pur pose, but it would have added still further solemnity to the scene. On the ground on which they stood, a number of men were to be cruelly confined, after an unsuccessful rising to support the principles of that very document that now lay before them ; whilst, for the same offence, a select band were to suffer a reader may see the connection of the parts upon which we specially dwell with the whole. On the 3rd December, 1557, a number of Scottish gentlemen, who had been considering the dangers which the reformed faith vvas under going, met in Edinburgh, under the presidency of the fourth earl of Argyll, and subscribed a document by which they bound themselves \"to apply their whole power, substance, and very lives, to maintain, set forward, and establish the most blessed Word of God.\" This was the first of a set of documents after wards so famous in Scotch history. It was renewed in 1580, and vvas then sub scribed by King James, who (unfortunate man!) had still twenty-three years of Presbyterian eloquence and ministerial dealings to endure before the time came when he vvas to bask in the pleasant sunshine of southern episcopal flattery.

' The document itself vvas based on the plan of those that had preceded it. It recapitulated cruel death in the Grassmarket, and within a stone's throw of the kirkyard. But such thoughts were not present in the minds of the eager assembly who pressed forward. \" Such vvas the zeal of many, that, for a while, many sub scribed with tears on their cheeks ; and it is constantly reported that some did draw their own blood, and used it in COVENANTERS' TOMB, EDINBURGH. place of ink to underwrite their names.\" So says a writer of the period.

The party soon gathered strength and moved on Edinburgh, near which, at Rullion-green, on a slope of the Pentland Hills, they were crushed by the government forces under Dalziel, and, as was to be expected, the only effect of the rising was to call forth still severer measures of repression. Of the fate of those who escaped death, the following brief and apparently compla- cent sentence may be quoted : \u2014 \" Most of the prisons in the whole country are full of them; Barbadoes will be full plenished next year.\" Among a people so eager and so high-spirited as the Scotch, such doings were sure to produce a second revolt. The rulers were certainly not wanting in their endeavours to goad the people to desperation. An army, known in history as the Highland Host, was raised in the north, amidst \"a barbarous and savage people accustomed to rapine and spoil,\" and let loose on the devoted Lowlands. They were authorised \"to take free quarters, according as our Privy Council and their committee shall think fit to order.\" Then followed the assassination of Archbishop Shairp, in May, 1679, and the battle of Drumclog in the same month. This vvas succeeded by the great covenanting-rising which vvas put down by the Duke of Monmouth at Bothwell Brig, on the 22nd of June; and this was followed by still further execu- tions, confiscations, and other measures of repression.. Exactly a year after, on the 22 nd of June, 16S0, the extreme party among the Covenanters took the final step, and in the Sanquhar declaration, finally renounced all allegiance to the government, and solemnly excommuni- cated the king. It is from this period till 1685, when Charles II. died, that the persecution of the Covenanters vvas the bitterest; and to this time belong some of the most famous cases of the martyro- logy ofthe Covenant, as the shooting of John Brown by Claverhouse, and the death, by drowning, of the Wigtown Such professions might not be supposed to mean much ; but if we remember that the Scottish people, on the death of Charles I., forthwith proclaimed his son, we see that they were not quite words. As for \" the 107 kings,\" the new learning that was to make short work of con siderably more than half the number had not yet arisen, and the Scottish people were allowed placidly to feast their vanity by the contemplation of an imaginary line of shadowy sovereigns, whose supposod exploits we can still read in Buchanan's \"pictured page.\" The Covenant knit the nation together, and enabled it to act as one. It was this that gave it such an importance in the civil war that followed, and enabled it to throw the weight that turned the scale against the Royalists. As we have seen, Charles II. was proclaimed in Scotland on the death of his father, and cheerfully agreed to sign the Covenant to which, as a profession of theological opinion, he was probably profoundly indifferent, whilst he had his own intentions with regard to the practical part of the ques tion. It is needless for us to detail how the attempt of the Scotch to place Charles II. on the throne vvas crushed at Dunbar and at Worcester. At the Restoration in 1660, they sent up commissioners to London to remind His Majesty of his promise. One of these vvas James Shairp, the story of whose defection and assassi- nation we have already told. It was now evident that the government were determined to enforce episcopacy. There was a great turning out of Presbyterian ministers; soldiers were quartered on the people, and these, by every act of oppression, were driven to revolt. In 1666, a tussle between four Covenanters and some dragoons, which took place at i\u00bb"], [252, "236 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. imperfect indulgences had been issued, that, so late as May, in 1688, a fourth \u2014 full and effective to the moderate Pres byterians \u2014 was granted; it seemed to be extracted by force, like the ransom to which the captive assents when he feels the pressure at his throat.\" Indeed, what the Covenanters wanted vvas not toleration, but supremacy; and, as the more extreme sect soon became very discontented with the Revolution settle ment and the new government, it vvas not to be expected that they would be contented with anything the old govern ment would do. Still, the persecution vvas now practically at an end. It might be continued against the more extreme in an isolated way; but it could never again have the general force and effect it once had. As late as the very year of rescue there were still some exe cutions, and the last tragedy ofthe \" kill ing time\" did not take place till the 16th of February, 1688, when James Renwick \u2014 with no great zeal, indeed, on the part of his persecutors, for they tried every means in vain to get him to recant just a little his opinions \u2014 was put to death. Besides bearing the usual \"testimony\" against Popery, Prelacy, Erastianism; against all profanity, and everything con trary to sound doctrine, he also pro tested \" against the absolute power assumed by this usurper,\" and \"against this toleration flowing from this absolute power.\" martyrs. The accession of James the Second brought into operation a number of causes which relieved the Covenanters. The most prominent event of the beginning of his reign vvas the insurrec tion of Argyle in connection with the attempted rising to place the Duke of Monmouth on the throne. This com pletely collapsed, and was followed by the execution alike of Argyle and of Monmouth. The affair had considerable influence on the events of the next few years, for it confirmed James in his mad resolution to make England again a Catholic power. So easily had he crushed this attempt that he vvas con vinced his power could not be shaken. The events which made James during the last part of his brief reign not so much of a persecutor as his disposition inclined him to be, are vvell known. He wished to relax the persecution against the Roman Catholics, and he could not do so without also relaxing it against Nonconformists of all kinds. But, no doubt to the very considerable astonish ment of the government, the people were by no means anxious to accept the boon thus offered them. Like the Trojans of old, they w7ere wisely inclined to fear the Greeks, even when offering gifts. They knew that no real spirit of tolera tion induced the government to offer them this tardy boon; besides, it was clogged with conditions which made it unacceptable. \"It vvas not until three"], [253, "DRUMCLOG. 237 LOUDOUN HILL, Where the Covenanters defeated Claverhouse on the field of Drumclog.

It was inevitable that there should be resistance under the circum stances, and accident determined the particular form it should take. In this case the first actwas the \"Rutherglen De claration.\" This vvas a declaration which a party of Presbyterians openly pro claimed at that town on the 29th of May, when rejoicings were being held to celebrate the Restoration. These \"de clarations \" were almost the only solace of the Covenanters in their troubles. They were never tired of defining the exact position in which they stood, and in \" protesting and testifying,\" in the most explicit and positive manner, alike on the hillside and the scaffold, against the many things in church and state to which they were opposed. The docu ment itself on this occasion was a moderate one, but it was not published in a moderate way. The bonfires were all put out, for the testifyers strongly ob jected to the celebration ; but another fire vvas kindled, and at this a portentous mass of documents \u2014 Acts of Parliament, decrees of the Privy Council, Royal Proclamations \u2014 were committed to the flames, with every circumstance of solemn contempt. It was then resolved that a great conventicle should be held on the next Sabbath but one \u2014 that vvas, on the nth of June. Claverhouse, just beginning to acquire a \"bad eminence\" as a persecutor, was commander of the forces in the district. They expected opposition, and they went prepared to encounter it. to die sword in hand as to be taken and shot. Scouts were posted on the adjacent hill-tops, and these could signal the approach of the enemy. Then the meeting, if there vvas time, broke up and dispersed, or, if this was impossible, formed in a sort of rude military order and fought the dragoons. It is quite evident that the \"dispersing of a conventicle \" was a very serious business indeed, and not to be rashly undertaken, and as a sufficient number of troops were not always at hand forthe purpose, the majority of the conventicles were allowed to pass off undisturbed. A large portion of the country in the south-west of Scotland is admirably fitted for the holding of such meetings. Much of it is indeed now quite different from what it was then, for a great portion has been brought under the plough, and some of the very wildest parts have been found to contain vast stores of mineral wealth, and are now centres of busy manufacturing industry. Quite enough still remains barren to show us very clearly what was then the state of a very much greater area. Vast solitary moors covered with heather or stunted grass, interspersed with bogs difficult and dangerous to traverse, barren hills separated by deep and sombre glens, combine to make up a very \"universe of death.\" In these solitary regions, where the only sound heard is the de solate cry of the plover, and the chief moving thing is the mist perpetually creeping over the summits and the moor land, the traveller occasionally comes upon a rough stone, whose almost obliterated inscription tells us how here, in the \"killing time,\" some faith ful servant of God had met with a violent and bloody death at the hands of relentless persecutors. To understand the character of a race of men, it is, perhaps, always necessary to have seen the country where they lived, and it is when standing by one of these stones that one most fully compre- Conventicles, as may well be believed, were of all varieties, but the most fully developed kind were such as would take place when some famous preacher \u2014 a Welsh or Blackadder, a McKail or a Cameron \u2014 was known to be in the district.

One sees the effect ofthe surround ings of the place upon the men. Days and nights spent in solitude in such spots were not likely to produce soft and amiable characters ; but on deep and solemn natures the effect would be and was to intensify such natures. What has been said of the poems of Ossian might, perhaps, be also said of the writings of the Covenanters. If read in such a wilderness, even that which we might be inclined otherwise to call raving is seen not to be without its meaning and power. This influence was felt first by the preachers, who were most hunted, and therefore most confined to these wild solitudes; but through them it vvas com municated to those that heard them. On them the influence of the place, too, must have fallen. We see in them all the same spirit. selves, and the troopers, coming on at first at a good round pace, slowed and gradually stopped as they saw there was something more to be done than an easy chase after the fugitives from a dispersed conventicle. The situation was perplexing enough ; in front was the bog, over which the way vvas un known ; behind it the armed men. What they meant vvas abundantly evident, and those who were so ' fortunate as to escape the morass could not expect a very favourable reception as of necessity scattered and disorganised, they would crawl out at the other end. And yet to retreat would have given the insurgents more than the moral advantages of a victory. It would be as much as saying to them that if they only met in suf ficient force, they might do as they pleased. Claverhouse has left us a brief but emphatic account ofthe battle ; with the exception of one phrase which seems to be exaggerated, it is curiously favourable to the Covenanters. The commander, as Mr. Burton says, is almost \" carelessly candid \" in his confession of the defeat. He was not yet widely known, and he could but ill afford to have his reputation so soon tarnished. The plain statement has something finely honest about it. Indeed, it is much more to the credit of the \" insolent and fanatical Whigs,\" than Sir Walter's somewhat disingenuous account in \"Old Mortality.\" Both sides, says Claver house, threw forwards some parties to skirmish, and in this the Covenanters lost. It would seem that as the dragoons kept on their side of the bog, the others had to come forward and fight them on their own ground, which they could not advantageously do. But now the blood of the hillmen vvas up, and they eagerly demanded to be led to close quarters. Their leaders were nothing loath, and in a very short space of time the greater part of the force vvas over the morass and advancing on the enemy. It is not quite clear why these awaited the It vvas a meeting of this kind that re sulted in the engagement at Drumclog. The conventicle itself was held on a slope of Loudoun Hill, between Lanark and Ayr, but when the scouts gave news of the approaching danger it was thought better to transfer the actual scene of combat to Drumclog. There was no thought that day of retreating. They had come prepared for a_fight, and they had been roused by the words of the preacher, and there were men among them as leaders, whose lives were for feited already; for Balflour of Burley, and Hackston of Rathillet, who had been participators in the murder of Shairp, were there. All these reasons weighed with them on this occasion, but indeed at these later conventicles the men fought whenever they had the chance. Drumclog was a hillside farm, of which the aspect, though more cultivated, is not yet greatly changed. The battle vvas a simple enough business. The Covenanters were of course on the ground first, and they strongly en trenched themselves behind a bog. They made no effort to conceal them-"], [256, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 240 go vvell. His mode of getting this agreement vvas by heated theological discussion over the abstrusest points of Calvinism where the combatants \" found no end in wandering mazes lost,\" and separated further apart than ever. Hamilton had a still further means for the conversion of error. It vvas simple and speedy enough. He employed the last hours of his brief authority in superintending the construction of an enormous gallows, and on this he pretty plainly intimated his intention of suspending not only the prisoners taken in war, but that Erastian section which he considered disgraced his own side, and which included all who differed from him on any point. Perhaps such a character is worth some close study. It may indeed be said simply that persecu tion had made him mad, and that he was not accountable for his own actions. But it is possible, perhaps, to understand his position, though that itself is of course indefensible. To such men as he \" moderates \" of their own party are the most obnoxious, because they are pre sented most largely before their mind. Of direct opponents, they simply con sider them as lost already, as brands not plucked from the burning, and so there the matter rests; but with these other there is perpetual collision and irri tation, and so they at last come to hate them more. For the same reason the \" indulgence \" was more hated than all the persecuting acts. It is at least to be noted of men like him, that if they were determined to grant no quarter they certainly not merely declined to ask but consistently refused it when offered. He ardently thanks God that he \" never had nor would take a favour from enemies, either on the right or left hand, and desired to give as few.\" It is among the inconsistencies, or rather, we should say, among the lights that enliven the shadows of such deep places of human nature, that when he did address himself to the \"suffering \"shock.\" Now was surely the very time for a quick cavalry charge. Claver house thought, however, that they would break before a volley. \" We kept our fire till they were within ten paces of us.\" It was poured in then, and of course did its execution, but it had no more effect on the main body than the summer wind that fanned their faces. \"They received our fire,\" goes on the account, and\"advanced to shock.\" Then followed the usual course of things that complete a successfully begun attack. The line of the enemy was broken, and they were forced back. \" Their horse took the occasion of this, and pursued us so hotly that we had no time to rally.\" Claverhouse saved the standards, but that vvas all. The prisoners which he had with him when he advanced were lost. In fact, the victory was complete. Its effect may well be imagined ; the persecuted had borne their reverses with courage and patience, and now that a gleam of success visited their arms they thought everything was gained. And so the insurrection sprang at once into life. It ended at Bothwell Brig on the 22nd June. The proceedings be tween these two battles are not pleasant reading. Most of it is simply a record of mad folly. The insurgent army swelled to great pro portions indeed, but it vvas torn with internal dissensions. There were many reasonable and practical men in it, and these would have made a good fight with carefully prepared de fences, or if that were impossible, have obtained good terms of surrender. But there v/as a small section of pas sionate and impetuous spirits, potent now only for mischief, and these had at least as much influence as sufficed to destroy all chance of anything reasonable being done.

There is something then to admire even in this fanatical \"eminently unworthy Robin Hamilton,\" as he calls himself; but certainly his place was not before a highly trained army, burning to avenge the insult cast upon some of their number at Drumclog. Indeed, resistance was almost useless. The government, who acted on this occasion with rigour, and yet without needless harshness, had sent so large an army that no body of peasants could stand against it, and they had wisely placed one who, though Duke of Buccleugh in Scotland, was yet an Englishman, and therefore not so ob noxious to the other side as one of their own countrymen would have been.

We observe, with almost microscopic minuteness, the agonies ofa nation. To give anything like an idea of the contents of the closely-packed pages would be impossible. The effect is emphatically a cumulative one. It is the reiterated tale of death after death, and persecu tion after persecution, that impresses the reader. Still, there is an interest in telling again one or two of the more famous of the executions there recorded. The stories that we are about to tell are no new ones.

Many of them which are quite unknown, contain statements of executions as cruel as those of the Priesthill or the Wigtown martyrs; but as we look we see that the wisdom of the choice is always justified. Some pathetic incident is to be found that completes one story, and is wanting in another, and so the one is scarcely known to the curious student, whilst the other is a familiar possession of the general reader. It is with these familiar possessions that we have here to do, and the first of these is the very vvell known one of John Brown, the carrier of Priesthill. It may be as well to premise something. The incidents in this and the others are collected from various sources besides Woodrow, and it is perfectly possible that some of them are due to the popular imagination. They are true, however, as to the main facts, and this is the substance of the first narration. At Kyle, in Ayrshire, of which we have already said so much in connection with Burns, there is a parish called Muirkirk. Here is the farm called Priesthill, situated amongst \"heath, moss- hags, and rockis; \" and here, in the very worst ofthe \" killing time,\" there lived a small farmer and carrier called John Brown. He was a man of fair educa tion, and of a natural force of character and determination of purpose, shown alike nant. Peden had performed his marriage ceremony; he had harboured Renwick, and many others; he refused to hear the curates; he was, in short, such an one as would naturally be selected as an example. Claverhouse was at Lesma hagow, in Lanark ; he heard of this man, and set off to find him. The mode of procedure in all such cases was very simple. Some time ago the Sanquhar declaration, and a still more extreme \"Apologetical declaration,\" had been put forth by the \" hillmen.\" The officers were furnished with a brief form of abjuration, which they put to those they suspected. If the persons refused to take it, it was ordered \"that \u2014 whether they have arms or not\u2014 they be immedi- ately put to death; this being always done in presence of two witnesses, and the person or persons having commission from the council to that effect.\" Armed with these powers, Claverhouse set off across the moors, and came upon Brown as he vvas engaged in some farming work. The Covenanter knew well enough what the party had come for. He attempted to escape, but was captured after a long pursuit, which served to put the leader out of humour, and may account for someof theincidents which fol- lowed. The soldierscarried theirprisoner towards his cottage, and were seen by one of the children as she stood at the door. She ran in and told her mother that a great many horsemen were coming down the hill with her father. The mother understood what this meant only too well; but both she and her husband were long ago prepared for what was to happen. What now followed took place like some scenic tragedy which has been often rehearsed in imagination before the actual representation. She came to the door of her cottage with her"], [259, "THE MARTYRS OF THE COVENANT. 243 children. The prisoner was brought up, and the little dwelling searched. The further proceedings had a sort of savage brevity. \"I do not find they were at much trouble,\" says Woodrow, \" with him in interrogatories and questions; we see them now almost wearied of that leisurely way of doing business, neither \u25a0do any of my informations bear that the abjuration oath was offered to him.\" This, however, was probably done; some other accounts say it certainly vvas. At any rate, it was a vain ceremony. Brown, of course, refused, and was told he must die. The condemned man turned to his wife, and spoke a few words to encourage her. She was of such stuff as composed the heroic women of antiquity, and in that awful hour her chief care was to encourage him in his firmness and steadfastness. Woodrow tells in his own quaint way the con clusion of this tale of horror. \" With some difficulty, he was allowed to pray, which he did with the greatest liberty and melting, and withal in such suitable and scriptural expressions, and in a peculiar judicious style \u2014 he having great measures of the gift, as vvell as the grace of prayer \u2014 that the soldiers were affected and astonished; yea, which is yet more singular, that \u2014 as my information bears \u2014 not one of them would shoot him, or obey Claverhouse's commands, so that tie was forced to turn executioner him self, and, in a fret, shot him with his own hand before his own door, his wife with I doubt not your cruelty would go that length;\" and then, again, \"Well, sir, you must give'an account of what you have done.\" \"To men I can be answer able, and as for God, I will take him into mine own hand.\" The dragoons and their leader rapidly disappeared over the moor. The woman bound up the dead man's head with a napkin, covered him with her plaid, and sat down by his side in that awful solitude to lament for him. The first question the modern reader asks after reading a story of this kind, is, \" Are all these incidents sufficiently vouched for ? \" It would be scarcely fair to say yes. Even in Woodrow they are not all given, and what he does give he relates with some more hesitation than is usual with him. It is thus all the more noteworthy that we have an account of the affair by Claverhouse ; and this, as Burton says, shows it to be \" in all essentials as bad a business as Walker and Woodrow make it, and yet only a natural result of the orders of the council.\" This is Claverhouse's report : \u2014 \" On Friday last, among the hills between Douglas and the Ploughlands, we pur sued two fellows a great way through the mosses, and in the end seized them. They had no arms about them, and denied having any. Being asked if they would take the abjuration, the eldest of the two, called John Brown, refused it ; nor would he swear not to rise in arms against the king, but said he knew no king, upon which, and there being found bullets and match in his house, and treasonable papers, I caused shoot him dead, which he suffered very uncon cernedly.\" a young infant standing by, and she very near the time of her delivery of another child.\" Something in the cour age of the victim \u2014 some touch of felt cowardliness \u2014 which vvas not the fault of Claverhouse's character, seems to have stung him to unwonted brutality. \" What thinkest thou of thy husband now, woman?\" he said. \"I ever thought muckle good of him, and now more than ever,\" was the undaunted reply. \"It were but justice to lay thee beside him,\" he said angrily. \" If ye were permitted, The case of the Wigtown martyrs is probably the very worst of all the cases of that time. There was nothing very special about the case of John Brown. It we strip it of some ofthe details which do not affect the story; if, in short, we con sider it to be exactly as Claverhouse de scribed, it is bad enough, but a wide"], [260, "244 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. examination makes it lose its special bad ness, not by reducing it from the \" bad eminence\" of cruelty, but by raising others to its place. The records of the time teem with such transactions; but, after everything has been said, the case ofthe Wigtown martyrs, when laid bare of every particular of detail, appears to be a foul murder, and not even a judicial murder. The efforts that have been made to disprove it, have signally failed. They have only made the matter worse. It is the story of a blacker deed than was ever laid to Claverhouse's charge. This is Woodrow's account of the matter : \u2014 \u25a0 indictment of which the chief part accused them with having been pre- sent at twenty field conventicles. The fact vvas undoubted, and the law was quite clear enough. They were brought in guilty. The sentence vvas that, upon the eleventh of the month of May, \" all the three should be tied to stakes fixed within the flood-mark in the water of Bkdnock, near Wigtown, where the sea flows at high water, there to be drowned.\" Had this sentence, cruel as it was, been simply carried out as said, there would have been nothing special to mark it from many similar cases. But more remains. The father had gone to Edinburgh and procured, it appears without much difficulty \u2014 he was a man of substance and a con- formist \u2014 the remission of the sentence passed upon his youngest daughter. This encouraged him and his friends to make further efforts, and to strengthen their case they induced Margaret Mc- Lachlan to subscribe a petition, couched in the usual form, in which, confessing the justice of her sentence, she besought the lords of the council to have mercy on one of her years and infirmities, and promised in future to do all that the law required of her. It vvas not very common for the people condemned to draw back thus; but it need hardly be said that no one of the readers of to-day will be inclined to blame her. She was old and frail, and it is one ofthe laws of human nature that principles to which we may be devotedly attached seem to lose something of their strong attraction when the body trembles under the load laid upon it. No efforts were successful in inducing Margaret Wilson to move one step from the path that she had begun to walk in. In accordance with the example of those whom she had heard and reverenced during the short years of her life, she was engaged in adding her testimony to theirs. \" Dur ing her imprisonment, Margaret Wilson wrote a large letter to her relations, full In the year 1685, there lived one Gilbert Wilson, in the parish of Penning ham, in Wigtonshire. He vvas a sub stantial farmer, and not at all anxious to mix in the affairs of the \"society men.\" He and his wife were \" every way con form to Episcopacy.\" He had three children \u2014 Gilbert, sixteen ; Margaret, eighteen ; and Agnes, thirteen \u2014 and, as often happened in times like these, they were not of the same nature as their parents. They would \"by no means conform or hear the Episcopalian incum bent, but fled to the hills, bogs, and caves, though they were yet scarce of that age that made them obnoxious to the law.\" The son did not return home till long after the Revolution. He was a soldier in Flanders ; obtained a compe tency by his own industry; and ended his days in peace in the home of his fathers. At the death of Charles, the strain ofthe persecution vvas thought to have relaxed a little, and the two chil dren came to Wigtown to stay with an old woman of sixty, named Margaret McLachlan. She is described by Wood row as a \"country woman of more than ordinary knowledge, discretion, and prudence, and for many years of singular piety and devotion.\" Here they were all seized, thrust into prison, treated with great cruelty, and finally put on their trial at Wigtown on an"], [261, "THE MARTYRS OF THE COVENANT. 245 of a deep and affecting sense of God's love to her soul, and an entire resigna tion to the Lord's disposal. She likewise added a vindication of her refusing to save her life by taking the abjuration, and engaging to conformity ; against both she gives arguments with a solidity and judgment far above one of her years and education.\" ecclesiastical directions of the govern ment. As events proved, they judged correctly. They were never called to account in the matter by the government. On the nth of May, the two women were brought to the place of execution, and were tied to stakes within reach of the tide. The elder sufferer was placed so as to be drowned first; the younger much nearer the shore. The tide of the Solway, as is well known, rushes in with great violence, and the death decreed was thus not quite so merciless as it appeared to be. Still, there was of necessity some considerable time of interval before it began to flow, for when the victims were secured the flow could not yet have begun. The women employed the interval in the usual manner of such sufferers. They sang parts of the Scottish version of the Psalms, and recited portions of the Bible in the hearing of a great crowd who had assembled on the banks. Then the tide rushed in, and in a few moments the sufferings of the elder woman were over. The water was already closing over the head of the other, when a strange incident \u2014 from which the story g-ets its most pathetic touch \u2014 happened. It is best explicable by supposing that some secret instructions had been given to the commanding officers who had charge of the execution. Wood row thus relates the incident: \u2014 \"While at prayer the water covered her ; but before she was quite dead they pulled her up, and held her out of the water till she vvas recovered, and able to speak ; and then, by Major Windram's orders, she vvas asked if she would pray for the king. She answered that she wished the salvation of all men, and the damnation of none. One deeply affected with the death of the other and her case, said, ' Dear Margaret, say God save the King! say God save the King!' She answered, with the greatest steadiness and composure, 'God save him if He will, for it is his salvation I desire.' The council, however, were satisfied, on the whole, with the sureties that had been given, and the submission offered, and they ordered a remission of the sentence. This is the record : \u2014 \" April last, Margaret Wilson and Margaret McLauchlison, under sentence of death pronounced by the justices, are continued till , and the lords of his Majesty's Privy Council recommend it to the Secretaries to procure their remission.\" The blank dates are not material to the records, but they are curious, for they seem to show the haste and carelessness with which proceedings of such moment were \"-one about. What followed be tween this and the day of execution is not clear. It would seem to be this. The remission was sent to Wigtown, but those who held the authority there de termined not to give it effect. They were at desperate war with the Cove nanters ; two of them were Grierson of Lagg \u2014 \" a very Herod according to the covenanting traditions \" \u2014 and David Graham, the brother of Claverhouse, and they felt that to allow a person condemned to death, and who still per sisted in her offence, to escape them would be a signal defeat. There vvas, perhaps, sufficient irregularity about the warrant to give them some sort of pre text for allowing the law to take its course ; at any rate, they were men of powerful influence and high official posi tion, and they could confidently trust that there vvas little danger that they would be blamed for an excess of zeal in a place where the whole force of the crown was hardly sufficient to produce even the appearance of obedience to tbe"], [262, "246 PLCTURESQUE SCOTLAND. \"Whereupon some of her relations near by, desirous to have her life spared if possible, called out to Major Windram, ' Sir, she hath said it; she hath said it.' Whereupon the major came near, and offered her the abjuration, charging her instantly to swear it, otherwise return to the water. Most deliberately she re fused, and said, 'I will not, I am one of Christ's children; let me go.' Upon which she vvas thrust down again into the water, where she finished her course with joy.\" Then the writer goes on to record other cases of almost equal cruelty that happened on this nth of May, which, he says, \"hath been a black and very remarkable day for blood in several places,\" since \" Satan was now come down in great rage in his instruments, it was well his time was but short.\" came off only second best, as far as the argument went. In many a case they seemed quite abashed, and almost put to silence by the replies they re ceived. The accused were not so much full of hatred to their persecutors as of the most utter contempt, and this, which they took no pains to conceal, appears to have been exquisitely exasperating to the bishops and state officials that sat in council. Thus two servant girls \u2014 Isabel Alison, from Perth, and Marion Harvey, from Barrowstowness \u2014 are seized and brought, in turn, before the council towards the end of 1680. They assure Bishop Paterson that \"he seems to be a man with whom they have no clearness to speak ; \" they roundly denounce some of the questions as frivolous ; they deny knowledge of \" any Lord St. Andrews,\" whose death they approve ; scornfully reject the somewhat hypocritical pitj* which Bishop Paterson is pleased to ex press, and assure him that he has done them worse hurt than the loss of their lives, \" for it hath much more offended me,\" said one, \"that many souls have been killed by your doctrine.\" The same one thus replied to a request for her name, \" Since you have staged me, you might remember my name, for I have told you already, and will not always be telling you.\" Here is one more example of the fencing that took place. They asked \u2014 \u25a0 As yet we have not touched upon some of the most characteristic features of these persecutions. We have hitherto only gone into the more violent proceed ings in the country ; but it is the judicial processes before the Privy Council, and the supreme courts at Edinburgh, that present the best and most instructive pictures of the life of the time. A great mass of cases are given in the \" State Trials,\" besides the briefer notices in Woodrow. We shall say a few words as to these before we conclude the article. Those who were taken were examined at great length before the Privy Council, and in many cases were subjected to the most extreme tortures. The genius of Scott has reproduced one of these examinations with marvellous force in one of the most famous scenes in \"Old Mortality.\" There the scene is profoundly tragic, and it was so in most cases ; yet in some, were it not for the cha racter of the interests involved, we would have said there is a touch of the ridiculous in theproceedings. The favourite amuse ment of the privy councillors was to engage in acrimonious theological dis cussions with those who were brought before them, and in these they usually \"Who grounded you in these princi ples?\" \"Christ by his Word,\" she answered. \"Did not ministers ground you in these ? \" \" When the minister preached the Word the spirit of God backed and con firmed it to me.\" And so on with wearisome iteration. After a number of these replies had been taken down, the prisoner was asked to subscribe. This was usually declined, as it was supposed that doing so would have involved the recognition of the government. The next proceeding was"], [263, "THE MARTYRS OF THE COVENANT. 247 the trial before the Court of Justiciary, which was a very simple affair, as the statements of the prisoner before the Privy Council were considered quite sufficient evidence on which to obtain a conviction. Then sentence followed, and then, in some cases, almost immediately, the execution. When that vvas deferred, it was only that the condemned might be insulted and persecuted between the time of sentence and execution. What little effect all this had may be seen by one extreme case, viz., \" the last testi mony of William Cuthill, seaman, in Barrowstownness, who suffered at Edin burgh July 27, 1681.\" He employed the night before his execution in pro testing against the things of which he disapproved, and these were a toler ably formidable list, comprising every party, or division of a party, that differed in the least from him. He tells us what he adheres to as follows : \"Now, in the next place, I witness by this my testimony, my adherence to the scriptures of truth, the Holy Bible, the Old and New Testament, which has been made sweet to me. I witness my adherence to the Covenant's national and solemn league, confession of faith ; only there is something in it concerning the magistrates calling a synod of ministers, by virtue of his magisterial power, which ought to be cautiously understood according to the general assembly's ex planation. I adhere to the catechism, larger and shorter, psalms in metre, directory for worship, form of church government, the doctrine of the Church of Scotland as it is held out in the Word of God, and laid down in the formal papers. I adhere to all faithful testi monies to truth in Scotland, of one sort and another, particularly these three \u2014 the papers found at the Queensferry of the date of June 3rd, the Sanquhar de claration, the Rutherglen testimony, and every other paper tending to the good of religion, and particularly the cause of wrath, and I request to read and con sider them.\" This is an extreme \"testi mony and protest,\" but all the others, if not quite so thorough-going, were equally firm. The government had to confess themselves defeated by pass ing on to the more violent action of field huntings, abjuration tests, and death without trial. These were equally unsuccessful, and the only effect was to burn Presbyterian Calvinism, as with a red-hot iron, into the deepest heart of the Scottish people."], [264, "248 THE INTERIOR, GLASGOW CATHEDRAL.

It is strange, indeed, how these Highlands have fascinated the literary imagination of the world. One would think that all Scotland vvas a huge hill, on which maidens with flowing locks and bare feet, but withal of wondrous beauty, were continually being courted by tartaned youths of great strength and dauntless bravery. This is the Scot land of romantic literature, though those who know anything of the real history of the country are well aware that all the real movements of Scotch history have come from the prosaic Lowlands ; that tfcftam^.1\", bor n e the heat and burden of ft*- day ; \" and that the very bard who has done most to make the Highlands famous was himself a Lowlander.

In the Fountain Close, connected with the Water-gate, the ruins of a house be- longing to the Bishop of Dunkeld are still observable. At the south end of the Water-gate stood, till lately, Gowrie Castle, which vvas the scene of that pro- blematical event in Scottish history called the Gowrie Conspiracy. At the southeast end of the garden attached to the house, stood the Monk's Tower, the origin of which is uncertain ; and at the south- west, the Spey Tower, once a stately fortress with a strong prison. These towers were connected by the old city wall. At the end ofthe Spey-gate, once stood a convent of Greyfriars, which was destroyed at the Reformation. In St. John's-street is St. John's Church. In this church the spirit of the Reformation burst out, upon the occasion of Knox preaching against idolatry. After the sermon, a priest having imprudently opened his repository of relics and images, and being about to say mass, the audience, who had caught the en thusiasm of Knox, attacked the priest, broke the images, tore the pictures, threw down the altars, scattered the vases; and then proceeded to the mon asteries ofthe Grey and Black Friars, and Carthusians, which they pillaged and entirely destroyed. St. John's is now divided into the east, west, and middle churches. Blackfriars-lane conducts to the grounds which belonged to the monastery of that name. The monastery, of which not a vestige remains, vvas founded by Alexander II., and after the destruction of the castle became a royal residence.\" Wi' all the keys in her hand, Saying, \" Tak you these, bonnie Lizzie, All under them's at your command.\" We may leave Lizzie at Kingussie, for our journey does not lie exactly that way at present. Perth is our halting- place, for it seems, on the whole, about thebestplace from whichto start fora few Highland excursions. The modern town \u2022consists of a number of streets \u2014 Athol- street, Charlotte-street, Mill-street, High- stree:, South-street, and others, running almost directly west from the river Tay, which, flowing due south, forms the \u2022eastern boundary of the town. To the north and south of the town lie two .meadows, called respectively the North and South Inch. Perth is of almost fabulous antiquity. According to some .authorities it was founded by Ag-ricola, which is almost certainly impossible. According to others, it vvas built by some Pictish king. Speculations such as these put us in mind of one of the .theories that used to be propounded to \u2022account for the use of language by the human race. It was said that mankind met in a great council and agreed that \u25a0certain sounds should in future be taken to denote certain things!

This vvas the murder of James I. by Robert Gra ham and a band of conspirators whom he had collected round him. James's vigorous measures for the preservation of order, and especially his attempt to curb the power of the nobility, had raised up certain parties against him. Graham, who had been imprisoned by the King, soon collected a band ready to do the deed of blood. With a savage nobility, he openly cast off allegiance to the crown, and avowed his intention. A price was set on his head, but the out law was far away in the highlands, and no very special attention vvas paid to him. James went to spend Christmas in Perth, and there took up his residence in the monastery. The conspirators were in the town, and soon had laid their plans for the attack. Something must have been known of their movements, for certain vag-ue rumours seem to have reached the King's ears. But he paid little heed to them. Probably rumours like this had assailed him every year of his reign, and it vvas only when looked back on in the light of after events that they seemed to acquire point and prophetic meaning. The night fixed for the execution of the deed vvas spent by James in pleasant sport, as be fitted the festive time of the year. There was song and dance and mirth till a late hour. But at last the feast was over, and all the courtiers withdrew. The King was left alone with his wife and her attendant women. He vvas about to retire, when suddenly there flashed on the windows the light of many torches, and the clang of armour was heard, and of feet hurrying towards the door. The King remembered the predictions, and. recognised that he was doomed. He made one frantic effort to save himself. He raised a plank in the floor, and got down into a small vault. He implored the ladies to guard the door for a few minutes whilst he at- tempted to escape. By a strange fatality, \" only three days before, he had caused the opening to be built up, because, when he played at ball in the court-yard, the ball used to roll into the vault through that hole.\" And so he was obliged to remain there. The murderers had now reached the room. The bolts had been treacherously removed from the doors, and the feeble strength of the women could oppose no real opposition to their entrance. One act of personal heroism casts a bright gleam over the savage scene. One of the Queen's maids of honour, Catherine Douglas\u2014 the brave daughter of a brave race \u2014 thrust her arm into the socket, but the frail obstacle vvas torn asunder, and the room w7as filled with the armed men. The King vvas not there, however, and thinking themselves mistaken, they left the room to seek him elsewhere. The King got impatient and attempted to come forth, but he vvas not successful, and the conspirators, probably attracted by the noise, again returned to the apart- ment, and now at last they had found their prey! \"Sirs,\" said one of them with cruel mirth, \"I have found the bride for whom we have sought and carolled all night.\" The King fought des- perately but in vain. As he sank down exhausted, he gasped out a request for a confessor. \" Thou shalt have none but this sword,\" said Graham, as he stabbed him again and again. It may serve as an instance of the resolute brutality of the time, that the only regret the mur- derers had vvas that they had not also slain the Queen, and Graham, when put to death with incredible tortures, per- sisted to the last in justifying the deed. The news was received by the nation with universal sorrow. \" He vvas buried,\" says Drummond of Hawthornden, \"in the Charter House of Perth, which he had founded, where the doublet in which he was slain vvas kept almost to our time as a relic, and with execratious scorn of"], [269, "THE FAIR CITY OF THE HIGHLANDS. 253 the people, every man thinking himself interested in his wrong.\" and are ascribed to James on very good authority. According to Pope's well-known line, \"A Scot will fight for Christ's Kirk on the Greene,'.' and it would seem to have been a point of honour among Scottish critics to assert, as Pinkerton has done, that \"the 'King's Quhair' equals anything Chaucer has written.\" This is extra vagant, but there is no doubt that the \" Quhair \"isa piece of very fine work indeed. Here are the sweet and tender lines in which he tells us how he first saw his love : \u2014 James the First has other claims on our notice besides those arising from the fact that he was a firm and wise ruler, and that he met with so tragic a death. His name holds a high place in the list of Scottish poets. Like so many of the Stewarts, he possessed the literary faculty in no common degree. When a boy he had been sent to France to com plete his education, but on the way had been (in violation of a treaty of peace then existing between the two countries of England and Scotland) captured by an English vessel and taken to London. He vvas kept a prisoner in the South for eighteen long years, and, like many other famous men, he found in literature the truest and best consolation for his misfortunes. One thing his captors did do for him \u2014 they gave him a most com plete education, and old Hector Boece waxes right eloquent as he descants on his accomplishments : \u2014 Now was there maid fast by the Touris wall A gardyn faire, and in the corneris set Ane herbere grene, with wandis long and small, Railit about, and so with treis set Was all the place, and hawthorn hegis knet, That lys was non, walkying there forbye, That mycht within scarce any wight aspye.

He has told us in fit and beautiful words how he first saw and conceived an affec tion for Lady Joanna Beaufort\u2014 a lady directly descended from Edward III. His suit was successful, and she became his queen. It was she who, with some thing of the same wild passion that maddens the tigress robbed of her young, hunted down with relentless hate the murderers of her husband. James wrote the \"King's Quhair\" (or book) de scriptive of his courtship, and \" Christi's Kirk on the Grene,\" and \" Peblis to the Play.\" These two last are humorous, Kest I doun myn eye ageyne, Quhare as I saw walkyng under the Toure, Full secretely, new cumin hir to pleyne. The fairest or the freschest young floure That ever I sawe, methoucht, before that houre, For quhich sodayne abate, anon astert The blude of all my body to my hert.

The quarrel vvas the cause of great perplexity to the government. Commissioners were appointed to deal with the parties to the feud, and they at last got them to agree that thirty from each side should meet at Perth in the presence of the King, and there make an end of each other and the dispute. No doubt the government were inclined to exclaim, \"A plague on both your houses,\" and to wish, like the Kilkenny cats, each side might destroy the other. The 25 th October, 1396, was the date appointed, and on that day the combat took place. As might well be expected, a vast number of spectators came to see so strange a sight, but a hitch suddenly occurred. OneConnacher, a member ofthe clan Chattan, being of a timorous and hesitating nature, felt his courage now utterly fail him. He made off, and who was to supply his place ? At this emergency the famous Hal 0' the Wynd, by profession a smith, came forward and offered to take part, stipu lating that, as reward, he should have his board of the victors as long as he lived. Os hir array the form gif I sal write, Toward her goidin haire, and rich atyre, In fretwise couchit with perlis quhite, And grete balas lemyng as the syre, With mony ane emerant and faire saphire, And on hir hede a chaplet fresch of hewe. Of plumys partit rede, and quhite, and blewe. Full of quaking spangis brycht as gold, Forgit of schap like to the amorettis, So new, so fresch, so pleasant to behold, The plumys eke like to the floure jonettis, And other of schap, like to the floure jonettis ; And, above all this, there was, wele I wot, Beautee eneuch to mak a world to dote. About hir neck, quhiie as the fayre anmaille, A gudelie cheyne of small orfeverye, Quhare by there hang a ruby, without faille Like to ane hert schapin verily, That, as a sperk of lowe so wantonly Semyt birnying upon hir quhite throte. Now gif there was gud pertye, God it wote. And for to walk that fresche Mayes morowe, Ane huke she had upon her tissew quhite, That gudeliare had not bene sene to forowe, As I suppose, and girt sche was alyte ; Thus halflyng lowse for haste, to suich delyte, It was to see her youth in gudelihed, That for rudeness to speke thereof I drede. In hir was youth, beautee, with humble aport, Bountee, richesse, and womanly faiture, And now at it they went with fell purpose, and the King and statesmen saw with grim satisfaction how fast the number of dangerous law-breakers was being reduced. At last victory, chiefly through the exertions of Hal, declared itself for the clan Chattan, of whom no less than eleven members remained alive, whilst, on the other side, there was but one. This one was unhurt, and the others were all terribly wounded, and had he been worth very much he might, as in the famous combat of the Horatii and Curatii, have slain all his opponents, and still kept the victory. But his heart failed him when he saw the fearful odds against him. He turned and fled ; escaping by swimming across the Tay. There is a Scotch proverb to this effect : \u2014 \" Every man for his ain hand, like Hal o' the Wynd.\" The story of its origin runs, that Hal did not God better wote than my pen can report, Wisdome, largesse, estate, and conyng sure In every point, so guydit hir mesure, In word, in dede, in schap, in contenance, That nature mycht no more hir childe auance.

Perth vvas the theatre of another scene of blood, of not less note than the murder of James, though the combat of the clans owes much of its celebrity to the fact that it forms the subject of a Waverley novel. The facts of the case are briefly as follow7s : \u2014 At the end of the 14th century there was a deadly feud between the clans Chattan and"], [271, "SCONE, AND THE STONE OF DESTINY. 255 even know the name of those for whom he had fought, but replied that he had gone on the principle of \" fechtin' for his ain hand.\" Master of Ruthven, were produced. A solemn mockery of a trial was gone through. They were found guilty of HighTreason, were declared traitors, and the usual cruel punishment for the offence vvas carried out on their senseless re mains. We might dwell long on the martyrology of Perth, for a very large number of victims were here put to death by the Roman Catholics, and one or two by the government, for their adhesion to the Covenant, and we might tell many a tale of those who fell by floods and pestilence in the Fair City, and of the troubles its citizens had with Royalists and Jacobites, but we forbear to revive in these pages the memories of these almost forgotten woes. Probably the reader has had enough of these fightings, so we will not again recount or attempt to explain the inex plicable Gowrie conspiracy mystery, nor comment on the cruel revenge that King James took. That prince, like many other weak natures, was, although marked by an easy-going sort of humour, lisb'e io almost ecstasies of terror and fear. One incident of this affair may be mentioned as showing the ferocity that lingered so late in our annals. At a parliament held shortly after, the bodies of the Earl of Gowrie and his brother, the Scone, and the Stone of Destiny. HEN a Scotchman power of the English kings, but of the little town of Scone, and the ancient kingdom with which its destiny vvas supposed to be connected. Its me mories are still more of the Tay than the Thames. It still has something more of Scotland than of England about it. The legend of the stone exists in very many forms, of which (as we presume they are all equally false) we may as vvell choose the most picturesque. It first appears in history as the pillow of the Patriarch Jacob at Luz. Previous to this there is no trace of it, which is a little tantalising, as one would havethought the chroniclers might have carried up its history a little further, and, as children say, \" begun at the beginning.\" But this unexpected reserve does add a certain charm and mystery to the subject. The stone is next found in possession of one Gathelus, \" son of Cecrops, King of Athens.\" This Gathelus vvas rather of a wandering goes into Westmin- ster Abbey, there is one object which has for him a particular interest. This is not the famous fabric itself, nor the shrine of Ed ward the Confessor, nor even the splendid tomb which the somewhat tardy piety of her son erected over the place where the Queen of Scots is buried. It is the clumsy, oblong piece of stone which is placed under the chair in which the kings of England are crowned. This is the fatal stone, or stone of destiny, or fatal chair, as it has been variously called. It has lain in its present position for about six cen turies, and yet, to the imagination, it has a foreign sort of look about it. It speaks to the onlooker not of stately Westminster and the splendour and"], [272, "256 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. disposition.

He received timely warning of the plagues, and immedi ately embarked on the Nile and sailed working stone as a parting gift, he went to Ireland, where he ruled for many years. It was on this stone \u2014 placed on the famous hill of Tara \u2014 that a long succession of Irish kings were crowned."], [273, "SCONE, AND THE STONE OF DESTLNY. 257 As each king was in turn seated on it, the stone gave forth a certain sound, which intimated its opinion of the person seated thereon, and which was deemed prophetical of the nature of the reign. As the king was solemnly crowned, the fatal stone begins to have a real existence. It emerges from the myths and mists of its early history, and stands forth a real and palpable shape. It was, no doubt, much then as it is now, \" of a dull reddish or purplish sandstone, with a few small imbedded pebbles, one of which is of quartz, and two others of a dark material, which may be Lydian stone. The rock is calca reous, and is of the kind that masons would call freestone.\" the Druids chanted in Gaelic the won drous prediction: \u2014 Cionwdh scuit saor on fine, Man ba breag an Faisdine, Mar a bhfuighid an Lia-fail, Dlighid flaitheas do ghabhail. As we have thus discussed at some length the fabulous history of the stone, it is, we think, only fair to the reader to give him the perhaps too sceptical opinion of Mr. Skene, in his interesting little pamphlet, \"The Coronation Stone\": \u2014 \"The conclusion I have come to is that there was no connection between the stone at Scone and the Lia Fail at Tara, and that the legends of their wanderings, like those of the tribes with which they are associated, are nothing but myth and fable. It vvas the custom of Celtic tribes to inaugurate their kings upon a sacred stone supposed to symbolise the monarchy. The Irish kings were in augurated on the Lia Fail, which never vvas anyw7here but at Tara, the sedes principalis of Ireland, and the kings of Scotland first of the Pictish monarchy, and afterwards of the Scottish kingdom, were inaugurated on this stone, which never vvas anywhere but at Scone, the sedes principalis both of the Pictish and of the Scottish kingdoms.\" Which vvas afterwards better known in the Latin distich \u2014 Ni fallat fatum, Scoti, quocunque locatum, Invenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem, Which Bellenden translates \u2014 The Scottis sail brwke that realm as native ground, Geif weirdis faill nacht, quhairever this chair is found. Or to give it (lest we too much weary the reader) in a more modern form \u2014 Unless the fates are faithless grown, And prophet's voice be vain, Where'er is found this stone The Scottish race shall reign. Fergus, son of Ferchard, first king of the Scots in Scotland, crossed over into that country, taking with him, as a sort of palladium, the stone of mystery, and there he reigned in state and splendour for many years. As the reader is, per haps, getting a little mixed as to his dates, we may inform him that this transmigration of the Scots is said to have taken place about 371 b.c The stone vvas deposited in the castle of Dunstaffnage, a very early residence of the Scottish kings, and here it lay for many centuries. In the year 834, how ever, \"it was carried by Kenneth II. to Scone, in Perthshire, there to remain from thenceforth as a sacred token for the establishment of the Scottish king dom in that countrie.\" From this time Still, after every deduction has been made, there is no doubt that the stone is one of the most interesting relics of the past in existence. On it a long line of Scotch and English kings have been crowned, and it vvas long regarded as peculiarly inseparable from the Scottish monarchy. It vvas, indeed, to evade the prophecy which said that a Scot should rule where it vvas, that Edward took it away from Scone, and placed it in Westminster Abbey. It was the visible sign of the monarchy of Scotland, and"], [274, "258 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. when it vvas removed, that seemed re moved with it. When Scotland again became free, King Robert the Bruce, when concluding a treaty of peace with Edward III., on the basis of the respec tive independence of the two peoples, stipulated for the restoration of the stone, but the Londoners rose in a mob, and pre vented its removal. Bruce vvas, without much difficulty, induced to forego the condition. That great king vvas by no means exempt from the superstitious beliefs of his age, and he, perhaps, thought of the prophecy, and may have indulged in dreams of a mighty future, if not for himself, at least for his descendants. Whether this be so or no, the stone, at any rate, remained at West minster, and the prophecy was believed to be fulfilled when James VI., a purely Scottish prince, ascended the English throne. being made king.\" Then, we are told, they led the boy, surrounded by the great nobles and dignified clergy, to the cimiterium or churchyard. This vvas under the canopy of heaven. Behind vvas the \"Mount of Belief,\" covered with a crowd of people, gazing at the solemn scene. The nobles made a ring round the chief actors at the coronation. The boy vvas placed on the wondrous stone of destiny, which vvas not bare as we now see it, but covered with cloth of gold, and then there came forward an old Highland scnnachy, and bending re verently before him, saluted the King in his mother tongue, in these Scottish words: \u2014 \"Benach de Re Alban Alexan der, Mac Alexander, Mac William, Mac Henri, Mac David,\" up to the end, that is, up to Gathelus, whose intimacy with Moses we have already referred to. The Mount of Belief here referred to was Moot Hill, or vulgarly Boot Hill, or Omnis Terra, or No Man's Land, of whose origin the following extraordinary account is given. It is said that when the barons came to be present at a king's coronation, they each stood in boots half filled with the earth which each one had brought from his own native soil re- spectively, and that thus standing on their own land, they were enabled to assist at the coronation of the king. When this business vvas settled, they emptied their boots at one place, and this in process of time grew to the height of a hill. Perhaps the most charming thing about this exceedingly unsophisticated tale is the notion it conveys of the great antiquity of the Scottish monarchy. What a long line of kings must have been crowned before their boot-emptyings could have made a hill ! Of course, the truth is this, that the name of Moot Hill was corrupted into Boot Hill, and that then this story vvas invented to account for the name. Moot Hill means the place of meetings, and here the Scottish kings were wont to hold councils. Here, too, in 906, the Of the ancient style of coronation at Scone we have a tolerably complete account given us in the case of Alexander III. by the old chronicler, Fordun. This was on the 13th July, 1249. The little king vvas only eight years old, and many of the nobles present objected to his coronation that day, since he was not a knight; but \"Lord Walter Comyn, Earl of Monteith, a man eminent and prudent in council, replied, saying that he had himself seen a king consecrated who was yet not a knight, and had often heard of kings who were not knights being conse crated, and added, saying that a country without a king was, without doubt, like a ship in the midst of the billows without a rower or steersman. He had also always loved the late king of pious memory, and this king on account of his father. He proposed, therefore, to ele vate this boy as speedily as possible to the throne, as it vvas always hurtful to arrangements already made to defer them. On his advice, the bishop and the abbots, as vvell as the nobles and the whole clergy and people, gave their consent and assent with one voice to his"], [275, "THE TRO SACHS. 259 Culdee church held a council, and Con stantine III., with Kelloch, the Bishop, and the Scots, vowed solemnly to ob serve the laws and discipline of faith, the rights of the churches, and the Gospel. \u00a370,000 to \u00a380,000. It does not fall within our scope to describe its archi tecture; its furniture; its paintings; its sculpture ; its busts and vases ; its situa tion ; its park, extending to upwards of 1,000 acres, and lawn, and wood, and gardens. These, indeed, baffle descrip tion, so uniquely superb are they all ; they must be seen to be duly appre ciated.\" And so the reader, if he has not the opportunity of seeing them, must just rest contented with the imagin ing. Scone is now an insignificant village, with none of its former glories about it. The only building of any note is the palace, which an enthusiastic admirer thus describes: \u2014 \"The present palace was reared on the site of the old one in 1803- 1 SoS, by William, third Earl of Mansfield, at an expense of from The Trosachs. IHF you I Scotland I you must visit the I Trosachs, that I if you have any I sense of the fitness I of things, and the reason is that not only is it a region exquisitely beauti- ful in itself, not only is it hallowed by the genius of Scott, but it is a sort of epitome or abridgment of Scottish scenery in general. Bits of it are like the quietest parts of the Lowlands, and other bits are like the wildest parts of the Highlands, and you have various kinds of scenery in between \u2014 all varieties, in fact. The Trosachs in one respect are like the law courts, which are said to have a tendency gradually to extend their jurisdiction. The name means a bristled region, and is well applied to a \" wilder ing scene of mountains, rocks, and wood, thrown together in disorderly groups.\" Properly it should only be applied to the centre bit about Loch Katrine, \"but the authority of custom sanctions the application of that name to the whole of the surrounding district, from the village of Callander on the East to Loch Lomond on the West, and from the Northern plains of Stirlingshire to the braes of Balquidder in Perth- shire. The entire district is, in round numbers, from twenty to twenty-six miles in diameter.\" As we purpose making a short excursion through this famous region, we shall take our depar- ture from Callander \u2014 a village which Glasgow merchants and Cockney tourists have descended on as Jupiter to Danae, in a shower of gold, with results eminently satisfactory to the \"men o' Callander and Airlie.\" Here you have all the comforts and most of the super fluities of civilisation, and at the same time are placed in a position for enjoy ing all the advantages of the position. No wonder this love for mountain scenery is a modern development.

There is a certain picturesque disorder and unmethodical grandeur about it, which fascinates whilst it perplexes the eye. The winding road discloses at each turn rock heaped on rock, in almost every con ceivable shape, whilst over all Nature has spread a mantle of vivid green, for our ideal tour is taking place at the most charming season of the year. Flowers are at our feet, and we see them peeping out of every crevice, whilst clumps of birch and ash and oak are perched on every height, and spring out of every ravine, winding in many a quaint contortion in between the rocks. Far above, the dark pine crowns the heights, from which many a mountain torrent pours down its impetuous stream. Rising right and left from out the meaner hills are seen above us the summits of Ben A'an and Ben Venue, guarding like sentinels the entrance to Loch Katrine, which at a turn of the road bursts full on our view, and there be fore us, in striking contrast to the savage grandeur of the heights, lie the placid waters of the lake, as, ruffled by a gentle breeze, they lap the edge of the silver strand; and now the sun sinks, but before \"all the ways are dark,\" he throws a wilder glory on the heights, and changes the water into a sheet of burnished gold, and illumines, with many a varied play of light and shadow, Ellen's Isle, which lies straight before.

The rocky summits, split and rent, Formed turret, dome, or battlement. Or seemed fantastically set With cupola or minaret, Wild crests as pagod ever decked, Or mosque of eastern architect. Nor were these earth-born castles bare, Nor lacked they many a banner fair ; For, from their shivered brows displayed, Far o'er the unfathomable glade, All twinkling with the dew-drop sheen, The briar-rose fell in streamers green, And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, Waved in the west wind's summer sighs. Boon nature scattered, free and wild, Each plant or flower, the mountain's child. Here eglantine embalmed the air, Hawthorn and hazel mingled there ; The primrose pale, and violet flower, Found in each cliff a narrow bower ; Foxglove and nightshade, side by side. Emblems of punishment and pride, Grouped their dark hues with every stain, The weather-beaten crags retain. With boughs that quaked at every breath, Grey birch and aspen wept beneath ; Aloft the ash and warrior oak Cast anchor in the rifted rock ; And higher yet the pine tree hung His shatter'd trunk, and frequent flung, Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, His boughs athwart the narrowed sky Highest of ail, where white peaks glanced, Where glistening streamers waved and danced.

Ben Ledi (we have already mentioned the name) means the Hill of God\u2014 for here, in ante-Christian times, the people of the neighbourhood used to worship the sun. The top, from its present appearance, must have been artificially levelled to afford greater standing room for the multitude who, in a far-off past, performed the strange rites of a forgotten worship. But we can hardly say quite forgotten, for in the \"Statistical Account of Scotland \" we find the follow- ing, which, as it seems very curious, we quote \u2014 the custom, we may remark, is talked of as fast wearing out : \u2014 \" Upon the first day of May, which is called Beltan or Bal-tein day, all the boys in a township or hamlet meet on the moors. They cut a table in the green sod of a round figure, by casting a trench in the ground of such circumference as to hold the whole company. They kindle a fire and dress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted at the embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten up, they divide the cake into so many portions, as similar as possible to one another in size and shape, as there are persons in the company. They daub one of these portions all over with charcoal until it be perfectly black. They put all the bits of the cake into a bonnet. Every one blindfold draws out a portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled to the High on the south, huge Benvenue Down to the lake in masses threw Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled, The fragments of an earlier world ; A 'wildering forest feathered o'er His ruined sides and summit hoar, While on the north, through middle air, Een-an heaved high his forehead bare. But what would the beauty of Scot tish scenery be without the brave deeds that have hallowed the wild spots, and the genius that has consecrated each crag and pinnacle? If you travel in the Trosachs you will see a rather rare process \u2014 a myth in the making. The guide will point out to you the exact spot where the gallant steed of Fitz james broke down, and the very place where Rhoderick Dhu fell in the fatal combat. Now, we do not mean to say that some well-informed guide may not know that, as a fact, the whole train of incidents thus narrated is mythical, but it is quite certain that only a few do so. Just let us suppose, then, that Sir Walter Scott, who had so much of the Homeric spirit, had been, like Homer, a blind beggar, unable to write, and that his songs had been handed down for a few centuries by word of mouth. Would it not have attained at least as much authenticity as the tale of Troy divine? But we have said enough on such a dry subject, especially in connection with such a place, and the reader will think that we are like those men of science (may we not add, falsely so called ?)"], [279, "THE TROSACHS. 263 last bit. Whoever draws the black bit is the devoted person who is to be sacrificed to Baal, whose favour they need to implore in rendering the year productive. There is little doubt that the devoted person was formerly killed, but now he is only obliged to leap three times through the flames, and this ends the festival. Again, on All Saints even they set up bonfires in every village. When the bonfire is consumed the ashes are carefully collected in the form of a circle. There is a stone put in near the circumference for every person, and whatever stone is moved out of its place or injured before next morning, the person represented is denoted a fey, and is supposed not to live twelve months from that day.\" But let us return to the island on which we are standing, and which is called, as we know, Ellen's Isle, and \"hereby hangs a tale;\" but first let us say a word as to the place itself. It is a craggy knoll, like the top of a partially submerged hill, and is so thickly covered with trees that when seen even from so near a distance as the \" silver strand,\" it seems nothing but a mass of foliage lying on the surface of the water. one of the soldiers swam out for it in order that by it he and his companions might remove the plunder. The man vvas a good swimmer, his progress vvas rapid, and his comrades watched him with an easy interest. Now he has touched the shore, and will be in pos session forthwith, when all at once bright steel flashes in the air, and the head less trunk of their comrade falls into the water, which is coloured with his life blood. None of his comrades were in clined to share his fate. After a few vain shots they drew off, and left the possessors of the island undisturbed. Helen Stewart was the name of the woman who thus saved the retreat, and the island was re-christened \u2014 if indeed it had a prior name \u2014 Helen's Isle, and from this Scott took, by a pardonable anachronism, the name of his heroine \u2014 though we could hardly imagine the gentle Ellen committing such a wild deed as cutting a man's head off. Away up the hill-side on our right, as we stand looking in the direction of Callander, we can see a sort of opening, rugged and irregular, in the face of the mountain ; this is the far-famed Goblins' Cave, where the fairies were wont to hold high court, and high revels too, of moon light nights. The \"good people\" must have had (we use the past tense, for we suppose that they are long since gone from this prosaic to-day world of ours) a fine taste in scenery. What could be finer than the view from the cave, when the moon is shining down into the loch, leaving one half in deep shade, and touching up the rest into bur nished silver, all the brighter by the con trast, whilst the night-wind sung in the pine-trees an eerie strain, to accom pany the mystic dance. Here the fair Ellen vvas fain to seek protection from the too pressing attentions of Rhoderick Dhu, as we are told by Sir Walter Scott in the following lines, which also contain such a graphic description ofthe cave : \u2014 The Stranger viewed the shore around ; 'Twas all so close with copse-wood bound, Nor track nor pathway might declare That human foot frequented there, Until the mountain maiden showed A clambering unsuspected road, That winded through the tangled screen, And opened on a narrow green, Where weeping birch and willow round, With their long fibres swept the ground ; Here, for retreat in dangerous hour, Some chief had framed a rustic bower. The storyof Ellen's Isleis this. Aparty of Cromwell's soldiers passed up through the Trosachs to the loch. The High landers had carried all their most valuable property to the little island, and there left it under the care of the women and children. There vvas a boat moored to the shore of the isle, and"], [280, "264 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

Let us bid farewell to the Trosachs and to Ellen's Isle, if farewell be possible indeed, for such scenes, though long faded from the eye, linger in the memory. As some ran dom thought gives them back to us for a moment, how they seem to rise in vivid brightness across the hideous ugliness of the Glasgow or London streets ! We forget for a little the busy hum and rush of the human current around us, and hear only the dash of the waterfall, \" and the whisper of the wind among the old pine branches,\" so that we hardly distinguish for a moment the real and the unreal. And what is fitter to recall the vanished beauty of the Trosachs than this tender sonnet of one ofthe truest of the poetson Nature? \u2014 It was a wild and strange retreat, As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet ; The dell, upon the mountain's crest, Yawned like a gash on warrior's breast ; Its trench had staid full many a rock, Hurled by prim\u00e6val earthquake shock From Benvenue's grey summit wild, And here, in random ruin piled. They frowned incumbent o'er the spot, And formed the rugged sylvan grot. The oak and birch, with mingled shade, At noontide there a twilight made, Unless when short and sudden shone Some straggling beam on cliff or stone, With such a glimpse as prophet's eye Gains on thy depth, Futurity. No murmur waked the solemn still, Save tinkling of a fountain rill : But when the wind chased with the lake, A sullen sound would upward break, With dashing hollow voice, that spoke The incessant war of wave and rock.

But even in the Highlands the time came when it became the fashion to have title deeds. According to the theory of the feudal system, all the land belonged to the king, by whom it was, under certain conditions, gifted out. This was* utterly repugnant to Celtic notions, but Celtic notions were not, in the long run, to prevail in Scotland. The neigh bours of the Macgregors were the Earls of Argyle and Breadalbane. Their influ ence at court was very great, and they easily obtained grants of the lands ofthe Macgregors. They proceeded bit by bit to take possession. The clansmen ve hemently resisted. This was represented at court as resistance to law, and so the whole force of the executive was turned to crush them. With that ferocious brevity and directness which render the Acts of the old Scottish Parliaments and Privy Council so great a contrast to the complexity and verbiage of modern legal documents, it was enacted of the \"wicked clan Gregor, so long continuing in blood, slaughter, theft, and robbery,\" that commission should be granted to their foes \"to pursue them with fire and sword,\" whilst the \"lieges were dis charged from receiving or assisting them, or affording them, under any colour whatever, meat, drink, or clothes.\" Macgregor after the classic manner, we should do it in somewhat of this fashion. We should relate how the Clan Macgregor were grievously pursued by their foes ; how their land was taken from them, and they were threatened with absolute extinction ; how, in this desperate strait, they sent messen gers to the oracle, with many gifts of Lowland cattle which they had \" lifted\" tor the special purpose, and that Pythia, being duly invoked, was graciously pleased to respond that \" Macgregor, despite them, should flourish for ever.\" Years passed ; the clan was utterly \" broke,\" and so was Pythia's reputation, when a famous poet and teller of tales arose, and so wrote about the clan that it revived in more than its former splen dour. Is it not true that Macgregor shall flourish for ever in the pages of Scott?. The Wizard of the North vvas particularly fond of Loch Katrine, for whilst one part has all the memories of the Lady of the Lake, the other end is full of reminiscences of Rob Roy. The little islands at the west end were once possessed by the Macgregors. To the north is Glengyle, the very centre of their country. Further north of this is Balquidder, where is Rob Roy's grave, whilst in Loch Lomond is his prison and cave. Now, as it is our intention to conduct the reader next to that queen of Scottish lochs \u2014 there are only five miles between it and Loch Katrine \u2014 we think it best to take Rob in transitu, so to speak, and first, then, of the Clan Mac gregor. This clan is of fairly ancient And now began a sort of savage civil war, in which the law was cruelly out raged, and then brutally avenged. To tell all the feuds between them and their opponents would be impossible, but the K"], [282, "266 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. feud which vvas the cause of their final extinction may be noticed briefly. Col quhoun, the laird of Luss, had executed two ofthe Macgregors for \" lifting\" a sheep. Immediately a force of three or four hundred men vvas assembled, and marched on Colquhoun, who collected all his forces to meet them. The battle took place in Glenfruin \u2014 \" the Vale of Sorrow\" \u2014 and the Macgregors were en couraged by a seer who saw in a trance the death shroud wound round the bodies of the leaders of the other party. The prediction proved successful, for the Macgregors were completely victorious. One event of strange ferocity marked the victory. A party of youths, \"candi dates for clerical orders,\" appeared in some inexplicable and mysterious way on the field of battle. They were only present, we are told, as spectators, but, nevertheless, were made prisoners by the Macgregors, and handed over to the custody of one Dugald Ciar Mhor, or the greatMouse-coloured Man, the foster brother of the Macgregor-in-chief. This individual, if he resembled a mouse in colour, certainly did not in disposition, for he made short work of his unfortu nate charges, and when interrogated as to what had become of them, he replied, ar, he showed his bloody dirk, \" Ask that, and God save me\" \u2014 this last phrase having been used by his unfortu nate victims in the agonies of death. This individual vvas the ancestor of Rob Roy, but it is only fair to him to mention that, according to some accounts, he died some years before the date of the battle. And now the full vengeance of the law was anew decreed on the unfortunate Macgregors. The name was abolished, and those who had been called by it were ordered instantly to choose some other ; they were forbidden to carry anything like a weapon, save a pointless knife to assist them at meals; they were forbidden to assemble in greater numbers than four, and the same provisions were afterwards applied to the children, for, notwithstanding al! that had been done, these were said to be so numerous that their numbers threatened to make the clan more powerful than ever. The persecution thus commenced vvas carried out with intensest zeal by the Earls of Argyle and Athole. At last Alaster Macgregor, chief of the clan, surrendered to Argyle on the promise that he should be sent out of Scotland. He was made the victim of a strange and cruel trick. The escort took him and the other prisoners a little way over the border, and then immediately marched them back to Edinburgh, where the whole lot were tried, found guilty, and hanged the same day. We are told that, \" for distinction's sake, he was suspended higher by his own height than two of his kindred and friends.\" He vvas thus, \" by merit, raised to this bad eminence,\" probably not with the intention of soothing his feelings, but to add additional insult to his last moments. And yet it seemed impossible to crush this people. Under Charles I., in 1633, there is an Act of Parliament setting forth \" that the clan Gregor, which had been suppressed and reduced to quietness (a fine illustration ofthe line 'To make a wilderness and call it peace') by the great care of the late King James, of eternal memory, had, nevertheless, broken out again in the counties of Perth, Stirling, Clackman nan, Monteith, Lennox, Angus, and the Mearns;\" and then a new commission is granted for the further crushing \"of that wicked and rebellious race.\" During the civil war the Macgregors proved loyal adherents of the Stewarts. Their admirers have cited this as a touching instance of their fidelity \"to the Crown of Scotland, which their ancestors once wore.\" Others, however, have thought that the opportunity of unlimited and legalised forays on the Lowlands had something to do with this. How ever this may be, King Charles did not prove ungrateful, and in the first"], [283, "ROB ROY AND THE CLAN MACGREGOR. 267 Scottish parliament after the Restoration the attainder was reversed, though it was reimposed after the Revolution, and not finally removed till after the Union. the inhabitants themselves, where a few men, acquainted with the ground, were capable, with ordinary address, of baffling the pursuit of numbers.\" From these fastnesses, then, Rob Roy vvas wont to issue forth on his predatory excursions, and for years he vvas so suc cessful in them that his name became a terror to the adjacent Lowlands. We now come to the individual who (thanks to the genius of Scott) has made the name illustrious. According to Sir Walter, he was born about the middle of the 17th century, and had some sort of right over Craig Royston, a domain of rock and forest lying on the east side of Loch Lomond, where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky mountains of Glenfalloch. At one time he was fairly prosperous. He carried on a per fectly legitimate trade in cattle, and had powerful friends and patrons, chief of whom vvas no less a person than the Duke of Montrose. From some cause or other he got into difficulties, and vvas charged with absconding with as much as \u00a31,000 sterling, which had been in trusted to him for the purchase of cattle. Montrose was exceedingly wrath at what he considered a breach of trust, and at what he afterwards called \" the insolence of that very notorious rogue, Rob Roy.\" The Macgregors were evicted from their dwelling, and Rob Roy's wife is said to have been brutally insulted. He avenged this by carrying on a system of regular warfare against the duke, and, indeed, against the Low landers in general, or as many of them as refused to pay \"black mail\" to him. It is not at all to be supposed that Rob Roy vvas a mere vulgar robber. He was kind and generous to the poor, and believed himself to be justified in the revenge which he took on the rich. Then, though brave himself, and daring, he vvas by no means of a cruel or san guinary disposition. Nor vvas he without a certain grace and dignity of manner which impressed those who came in contact with him. Personally, he is described as being very strong, with very broad shoulders, and very long arms. Wordsworth's description of him must be accepted as a fair if somewhat flattering portrait. Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart, And wondrous length and strength of arm ; Nor craved he more to quell his foes, Or keep his friends from harm. Yet was Rob Roy as wise as brave : Forgive me if the phrase be strong ; \u2014 A poet worthy of Rob Roy Must scorn a timid song. Say, then, that he was wise as brave : As wise in thought as bold in deed : For in the principles of things \"The country,\" says Sir Walter Scott, in words which are well worthy of quo tation for the excellent picture they give of the Highlands, \"in which this private warfare, or system of depreda tion, was to be carried on, vvas, until opened up by roads, in the highest degree favourable for his purpose.

Said generous Rob, \" What need of books ?

A more elaborate monument near it vvas erected to the memory of one of his sons, who died before him.

Popular legends have a great tendency to get mixed with one another. And it may be that because the stones were old and curious, and Rob Roy was remarkable, that the two got connected. By the side of Loch Lomond is Rob's cave, where he is said occasionally to have put up. In 1306, Robert the Bruce, when his fortunes were at a very low ebb, also took refuge here. Before taking leave of Rob Roy we may just mention the Clachan of Aberfoil, where, according to Scott, young Osbaldi stone received the note from the outlaw which justified the officer in detaining him; where the inimitable Bailie Nicol Jarvie defended himself so ably with the poker; and from whence the expedition proceeded on the way to Loch Lomond. We may quote the few words in which Scott describes the village. After re marking on the beauty of the scenery, he says: \"Man alone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in a scene where all the ordinary features of nature were varied and exalted. The miserable little bourachs, as the Bailie termed them, of which about a dozen formed the village called the Clachan of Aberfoil, were composed of loose stones, cemen ted by clay instead of mortar, and thatched by turfs, laid rudely upon rafters formed of native and unknown birches and oaks from the woods around. The roofs approached the ground so nearly, that Andrew Fairservice observed, we might have ridden over the village the night before, and never found out we were near it, unless our horses' feet had 'gone through the riggin.' \" Well, all this is very much changed now, and we must give Rob Roy a little ofthe credit due for the improvement. In poetry and romance his figure appears moving over the hills, and giving an additional charm to many a fair spot.

Roy, however, though an old man, vvas not to be so easily \" cheated \" as the lackadaisical Johnie, for he pursued the fugitives, and came up with them on the Braes of Balloch, which, for some unex plained reason, appears to have been a favourite haunt of Mrs. Roy, and brought back his faithless spouse to the seclusion of Aldivalloch. We must confess that there are many Ballochs in Scotland; but as this is the most famous, it is only poetic justice that we should assign to it the honours ofthe song. both Edinburgh and Glasgow, and this has specially directed attention to it; it is bound up with some famous events in history and romance, and then it is itself of great and varied beauty. It presents several striking gradations. The north end is narrow, and lies under the gloomy shadow of sombre hills ; the south end is broad and open, and lined by a rich and fertile tract of country. It is diversified by a great profusion of islands of all sizes and shapes and ap pearances. Some, likelnchtavannach, are densely wooded ; others, like Inchlonaig, are bare of trees. Inchnurrin is guarded by the ruins of an old castle; Inchailloch is consecrated by the remains of a deserted church. The traveller moves on throughout the whole twenty three miles of its extent through many a varied scene of hill and glen, and forest and stream, but all is alike beautiful. Let us briefly touch on one or two of the pointsof interest connected with the Loch. There is Balloch, over whose braes the love-sick \"Johnie\" wandered at some time or other, in hopeless love with that \" fair and false and fickle \" quean, Roy's wife of Aldivalloch, during which wandering he got \"cheated,\" as he frankly if somewhat vaguely informs us. Poor Johnnie, there is a certain fidelity The hill of Fingal, not far from Luss, puts us in mind of a more pretentious poem. This vvas a hunting seat of that very famous, if somewhat shadowy hero. This is not the place to discuss the questions which were raised on the publication of \"Fingal: An Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books, together with several other Poems, composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal. Translated from the Gaelic language by James Macpherson.\" The truth probably is, that Macpherson, basing upon some Highland songs, built up a superstructure of which something was real and a good deal fabricated."], [287, "LOCH LOMOND. 271 After all, it is vain to deny that Mac pherson vvas a person of no small literary ability. Dr. Johnson, it is true, would have none of him, but then Dr. Johnson was by no means infallible \u2014 witness his criticism on Lycides, for instance \u2014 and we must remember that men like Napoleon, and what is much more to the point, Goethe,saw much to admire in these songs. Alexander Smith has said of them that though they seem overstrained when read in the city, yet amidst the Highland Hills they seem to harmonise with the surrounding scenery with admirable fitness. \"In Ossian the skies are cloudy, there is a tumult of waves on the shore, the wind sings in the pine. The truth of local colouring is a strong argument in proof of authenticity. It is my belief that these misty, fantasmal, Ossianic frag ments, with their car-borne heroes, that come and go like clouds on the wind, their frequent apparitions, the ' stars dim twinkling through their forms,' their nai'des fair and pale as lunar rainbows, are, in their own literary place, worthy of every recognition. If you think these poems exaggerated, go out at Sligachan, and see what wild work the pencil of moonlight makes on a mass of shifting vapour. Does that seem nature, or a madman's dream ? Look at the bil lowy clouds rolling off the brow of Blavin, all golden and on fire with the rising sun.\"\u00b0 Of Fingal himself we shall only say that, according to the story, \"The King of Lochlen, the head of the great Northern sea-rovers, is invading Erin, and Fingal, the leader of the Kelts of Scotland, leads his warriors to the rescue of the kindred Kelts.\" Fingal is a good deal more shadowy than Arthur, and that is saying a good deal. Still, there is some poetry in the book, and some phrases of it may well accompany us in our journey over hill and dale. Another literary memory of a much more tangible character, though in finitely less pretentious, is connected with Inversnaid, on the other side of the Loch. Here Wordsworth saw that Highland girl who (strange fate!) lives, unknown to herself, immortal in his verse, in one eternal moment of her existence. She is the Lady of this Lake, and here is part of the song in her praise: \u2014 Sweet Highland girl, a very shower Of beauty is thy earthly dower ! Twice seven consenting years have shed Their utmost bounty on thy head ; And these gray rocks : this household lawn ; These trees, a veil just half withdrawn ; This fall of water, that doth make A murmur near the silent lake ; This little bay, a quiet road, That holds in shelter thy abode ; In truth, together ye do seem Like something fashion'd in a dream J Such forms as from their covert peep When earthly cares are laid asleep ! Yet dream and vision as thou art, I bless thee with a human heart ! God shield thee to thy latest years ! I neither know thee nor thy peers ; And yet my eyes are filled with tears. With earnest feeling I shall pray For thee when I am far away : For never saw I mien or face, In which more plainly I could trace Benignity and home-bred sense Ripening in perfect innocence. Here, scatter'd like a random seed, Remote from men, thou dost need The embarrass'd look of shy distress, And maidenly shamefacedness : Thou wear'st upon thy sorehead clear The freedom of a mountaineer, A face with gladness overspread ! Sweet looks, by human kindness bred I And seemliness complete, that sw*ays Thy courtesies, about thee plays : With no restraint but such as springs From quick and eager visitings Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach Of thy few words of English speech ; A bondage sweetly brook'd, a strife That gives thy gestures grace and life ! So have I, not unmoved in mind, Seen birds of tempest-loving kind, Thus beating up against the wind. * Smith's \" Summer in Skye.\" (All the ascertain able truth about Ossian will be found judiciously stated in the 5th Chapter of the first volume of Burton's History.)"], [288, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 272 the effect of one hill rising out of another.

One very re markable feature of this mountain is the precipice of at least 2,000 feet (the hill itself is 3,192 feet high). There are breaks at nearly regular intervals in it, and as we look along, it almost seems as if the mountain was upheld by a succes sion of gigantic pillars. The view into the great abyss beneath is strange and startling enough, but the imagination will perhaps find it still more striking if, as often happens, the deep glen is filled with mist, and the spectator looks down into a writhing and curling sea, which opens unexpectedly now and again into deep abysses \u2014 whilst, to render the con trast more striking, it may well be that at the same time the sky above his head is one mass of unclouded blue, and the sun has long since cleared away the mist from the landscape \u2014 though he leaves it its sullen retreat in the deep opening. Here, too, great masses of snow linger on into the year, when everywhere else the signs of winter have vanished. Nor am I loath, though pleased at heart, Sweet Highland girl ! from thee to part ; For I, methinks, till I grow old, As fair before me shall behold, As I do now, the cabin small, The lake, the bay, the waterfall ; And thee, the spirit of them all ! Near Luss there is a station called Stonehill, and from here, what is gene rally considered the finest view of the Loch is obtained. The full breadth of the noble sheet of water is before us ; we can see the whole of the islands of different shapes and sizes and geological formation and appearance. Far on the south the horizon is bounded byj, hills, soft and dim in the distance. Turning a little, we see the Leven threading the landscape like a streak of silver, and can plainly discern the bold outline of the Rock of Dumbarton. On the north, hills rise over hills in serried masses, be tween which the Loch narrows and gra dually disappears, whilst Ben Lomond on the east bank towers gigantic before us. Here we understand how not merely from its great beauty, but from the great variety of that beauty, this fair lake deserves the fame it enjoys. All this fine view, and a great deal more, is to be got by going to the top of Ben Lomond, but then it is not so strik ing from that height. By this we mean that the particular point of view is not so striking as regards the Loch, though in itself it is one of the most remark able of the Highland views. The out look over the Lowdands is specially fine. On either side we see the Firths of Clyde and Forth. The counties of Lanark, Renfrew, and Ayr on the one hand, and Stirling and the Lothians on the other, are spreadout like a map before us. But we must return to the Loch, of which we have yet one or two words to say. Not far from Tarbet, but on the other side, is a rock to which Rob Roy used to tether his prisoners. A rope was securely fastened round their bodies ; the free end vvas attached \u2014 not quite so securely \u2014 to a projecting piece of the rock ; the captives were then swung over, and as they hung airily suspended, they were invited to discuss the conditions of ransom. We doubt if this was Rob's regular practice, however. Perhaps on the rare occasions on which To enjoy all this it is necessary that you should first climb the hill.

Its defences are kept in constant repair, and it is garrisoned by a limited body of soldiers and functionaries.\" This, we may remark, is in accordance with one of the provisions of the treaty of union, though we should imagine Dumbarton Castle would not be of much use against some of our monstrous modern guns. \" Some parts of the rock are magnetic, and from the crevices there grow a profusion of wild plants, among which appropriately predominates the Scottish thistle, now an exceedingly rare plant in its natural state.\" Dumbarton was one of the first places ever fortified in Scotland, and hence it has a history ot its own of great length and some note. This cannot be said of the buildings, however, nearly all of which are of com paratively recent erection. On one of the older gateways there are two heads carved \u2014 those of Wallace, and Menteith, his betrayer. The latter is represented as biting his thumb, or perhaps with his finger in his cheek. This is said to be the sign which he gave in order that the hero might be seized. Another re presentation is that he is gnawing his cheek in remorse \u2014 but there are some objections to both. The story of Wal- lace's capture is by no means a clear one, though the fact of course is certain enough. \" At length,\" says Scott, \"he was taken prisoner; and, shame it is to say, a Scotsman, called Sir John Menteith, was the person by whom he vvas seized and delivered to the English. It is generally said that he was made E have been led to I some little extent : out of our way by our wanderings about Loch Lo- mond; but before we get ourselves back among the hills and glens and waters of Perthshire, it will be desirable for us to make a visit to the hill or fort of the Britons, that is to say, Dumbarton, otherwise Alcluyd, the Balaclutha of Ossian, who in the follow ing sounding words narrates a voyage to it. \" I came,\" replied the great Classamor, \" in my bounding ship to Balaclutha's wall of towers. The wind had roared behind my sails, andClutha's streams received my dark-bosomed vessel.\" Dumbarton lies at the spot where the Leven joins the Clyde. Be tween it and that river rises the huge Rock of Dumbarton, and on this the famous castle is built. Round this castle, in early times, gathered the few huts and the religious foundations which formed the town. The rock is about a mile round at the base, and 206 feet high. At the top there is a division of the summit into two peaks. This rock and Loch Lomond are really the only ob jects of much interest about Dumbarton, and as we have already noticed the one, we shall now confine our attention en tirely to the other. \" The fortress,\" says an authority, \" is entered by a gate at the bottom, and within the ramparts which defend the entrance, is the guard house and lodgings for the officers; from hence the ascent is by some flights of steps to the part where the rock divides. Here is a strong battery, barracks for the garrison, and a reservoir always filled with water.

And in after times it was reckoned ill-breeding to turn a loaf in that manner, if there vvas a person named Menteith in company ; since it was as much as to remind him, that his namesake had betrayed Sir William Wallace, the Champion of Scot land.\" expect from him as a generous lord and master, those who persisted in defying him had everything to dread from an offended sovereign. Thus his clemency was shown in a most remarkable manner to all the other rebels, this exception was alone made, that clemency might not be mistaken for weakness. In the so-called \"armory\" at Dum barton Castle there is a sword which was long believed to be the one worn by Sir William Wallace. Succeeding generations of sightseers gazed with admiring awe on the huge weapon, and reflected on the great strength of the hero who used it to such purpose. It was, alas,\\reserved for some iconoclastic antiquarian of our own time to put an end to this venerable delusion. The sword was conclusively proved to be long to the time of Edward the Fourth, and hence it was quite impossible that Wallace could ever have had it in his possession. Burton, however, tells us : \u2014 \"Wallace was found in Glasgow. The chief per son concerned in his capture \u2014 the leader, as it would appear, of the party told off for that duty \u2014 was Alexander de Menteith. Of certain rewards given to the captors he had the largest share. As his name was afterwards a common one in Scotland, it became partof the romance of Wallace's career that he vvas betrayed by a fellow countryman and an old com panion in arms; but Menteith vvas in the service of Edward ; he held the re sponsible post of Governor of Dumbarton Castle, and it seems likely that he only performed a duty \u2014 whether an agree able one or not.\" As it, however, cer tainly was the belief in Scotland that Menteith was a traitor, which after all he was in some sort, it seems likely that the artist meant to represent remorse in a rude sort of fashion. It is worth while, as the name of Wallace again meets us, to say a word as to his fate. He was in due time taken to London, where an enormous crowd of citizens flocked to see the man who had so long defied their mighty king. With a coronet of laurel \u2014 placed in bitter derision on his head \u2014 he was tried as a rebel subject of King Edward, was, of course, as the reader knows, found guilty, and exe cuted in the barbarous fashion reserved in that age for those who had been guilty of treason to their sovereign. This was no piece of purposeless cruelty, but part of a deep-laid policy. It vvas to convince the Scots that while thosewho submitted to Edward had everything to Menteith turns up again in connection with Dumbarton Castle, and a trick which he tried to play on Robert the Bruce. Bruce had summoned the castle to surrender, and to this the governor consented, on conditions which were far too favourable, for the place vvell deserved the epithet of \" impregnable,\" which Buchanan afterwards gave it. Bruce got a hint that treachery was intended, and indeed a number of English soldiers were hidden in the castle. It is said \u2014 though the trick seems childish enough \u2014 that Menteith received the king courteously, and showed him over the castle. One room he passed by without opening, but the Bruce insisted on seeing what it con tained. Menteith attempted to induce the king to pass on, but vvas at last forced to throw open the gate, and a band of English soldiers vvas discovered, who, no doubt, both looked and felt re markably '- small \" (to use an expressive vulgarism) on their unexpected dis covery.

As has often been found in such cases, the ladder turned out to be too short, and they were still some distance below the first resting place. But Crawford and the guide clambered up to it, and grop ing about, found a small tree deeply rooted in the crevices of the rock. To this the ropes were attached, and the whole party clambered up. The sum mit still rose high above them, but Crawford and the rest again climbed up, and now they were at the foot of the wall. They crouched down in the dark ness, and listened eagerly to the far-off call of the sentinel. This part vvas, as they expected, quite unguarded. When the watchers were furthest off they climbed the parapet, and gained pos session of the elevated position, and now at last they were observed, and the alarm given. The garrison rushed to arms, but already found their own guns turned against them, and the for tress hopelessly lost. Some escaped, some were taken prisoners. Of the attacking party none were hurt. A still more remarkable capture of the castle was effected in 15 71. It was held on behalf of Queen Mary, and when an assault on it was determined, the execution of it was entrusted to Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill, a relation of Lennox the Regent. There are many deeds of wild daring in Scottish history, but per haps none more daring than this. To take the castle by open attack was im possible, with the means which the assailants could command, and it vvas determined to try a sudden and secret assault of a nature so venturous that each man of the attacking party carried his life in his hands. The party marched through the night, and, as arranged, reached the base of the rock about 1 a.m., just when the moon had set. They were guided by one who had served in the castle, and knew its ap proaches well. With courageous acute ness, the apparently most inaccessible part of the rock had been fixed upon for the enterprise, for here it was scarcely guarded at all, and the noise which the assailants must of necessity make would be unheard. Besides, if the summit at this point were once gained the whole castle vvas commanded. Everything was still. The night was dark and foggy, and after some time had been spent in preparation, itwas computed that three hours were remaining to the party for their work. The men were all tied to gether, and they mounted one after the other, on a succession of ladders. Crawford and the guide headed the band. Some delay was occasioned by the breaking of the first ladder, but this was soon got over. Another strange difficulty occurred. One of the men was seized with a fit. He remained glued to the ladder, and could neither be moved up or down. With ready in genuity, Crawford ordered him to be According to Burton, this daring act had a most important bearing on the war. It more than anything else decided the fate of the Queen's party, and \"turned the balance \" in favour of the English as against the French alliance. It is recorded that the French had liberally provisioned the fortress, and that the conquerors enjoyed a sumptu ous repast after all their labours. All things seemed to have combined to put them in very good humour, for the prisoners were well treated, and the wife of the governor, whom her husband had left behind whilst effecting his escape, received the most courteous attention. There was, indeed, one ex ception. John Hamilton, last Archbishop of St. Andrew's, was among the prisoners. He was found in fighting gear, and well he might do all he could to defend him self, for to him there vvas no mercy. He"], [293, "K I LLIN, LOCH TAY, AND KENMORE. 277 was a persecutor of the saints. He had taken part, it was thought, in the murder of Darnley and of the Regent Murray. He represented everything, in short, that the other side hated, and he had already been formally outlawed. So, consecrated dignitary ofthe church as he vvas, he was strung up with but brief ceremony at Stirling, on the 7th of April \u2014 his capture had only been effected on the 2nd.

The Castle of Dumbarton was destined yet once more to change hands, and be taken by stratagem. This was in 1639, when the Tables were acting, always with great outward show of reverence, against Charles I. The royal garrison, seemingly forgetting that men are com manded to watch as well as to pray, had gone in careless ease to church on Sunday, and they were seized on the way back, and the place, now left defenceless, easily captured. His executioners exulted with savage joy over the cruel degradation inflicted on a nobleman and a prelate.

Pro- bably, it is that we once spent some specially plea- deepened, a walk along its shores in the summer night was something to be remembered. The mountain burns rush ing from the hills sounded strangely loud in the silent night, the heather scented breeze descended from the glens, and moaned in the tree-tops, whilst the constant lapping of the water on the stones at the edge, like a sort of lasting undertone, connected the various sounds of the night into one great harmony. No voice of living thing mixed with Nature's voices. The sheep were in the fold, the deer on Drummond Hill lay quiet, and every light was long out in the little village. Our footsteps were not audible on the soft white dust of the road that gleamed with almost spectral whiteness in the darkness. Everything vvas cool after the heat of the day. The very sounds spoke of rest and peace; and though the roar of the crowded street seemed still to sound far away in the sant days there, in a little funny-looking cottage that nestled close under Drum mond Hill, and that our notions of the district are all tinged by this. Yet Loch Tay hardly needs associations to make it admired. Its beauty is quieter, indeed, than that of some of the other High land lakes, but such beauty, if it sinks more slowly into the mind, is more likely to stay there. Often have we watched its waters as they reflected every hue of the dying day, and seen the evening star reflected from its bosom.

True, indeed, something of this sort mingles with one's recollection of many a lake, but with ours it must always specially be with Loch Tay. But let us treat this noble sheet of water in some sort of a methodi cal fashion, and so let us begin at Killin, which, in Gaelic, means \"the burial place at the waterfall.\" We confess to half-mythical hero of Celtic Scotland sleeps somewhere \" within the circuit of the hills.\" As the \"King ofthe Hills\" says, in words that, to our mind, have a touch of real pathos in them, and which seem prophetic of the fate of the race of which Fingal is the representative, \" We shall pass away like a dream.

It presents, in minia ture, a picture of Highland scenery. Here an adjacent knoll may be taken to represent a mountain; here a little stretch of level ground will do for a strath; here is a side-cutting caused by some tributary stream that forms a per fect glen ; here again is a deep pool overhung with bushes, that may well represent a loch with its adjacent forest, and to keep up the delusion we shall just pause here for a little, drop our line into the pool, and if we catch a most diminu tive trout, persuade ourselves that it is a salmon at an early stage of its existence. It was in the lower reaches of such a water as this that Wordsworth heard the chance song to which he gave so sweet a meaning : \u2014 There is a certain fine conscientious ness about this last remark. The writer is careful to point out that whilst Ben Lawers and Loch Tay are to be credited to Nature, she has nothing to do with the \" extensive woods,\" which must, in all fairness, be placed to the account of a \"late noble proprietor.\" The road along the north side of the Loch, which is the one usually taken, is sixteen miles in length, and brings us to Kenmore at the other end, where the Tay issues forth to pursue its course. The road keeps close to the water, and is dotted with hamlets and single houses all the way. The ruin on our right is Finlarig Castle, once a seat of the lords of Glenorchy, and where, according to tradition, they exercised a profuse and reckless hospitality. On we go till we come under the shadow of Ben Lawers, and cross Ben Lawers burn, which rushes headlong down into the lake. We re member fishing up this burn, with but indifferent success we acknowledge. Not, indeed, that the burn is to blame for that, for it is stocked with excellent trout ; but we did not take kindly to the occupation, and who could, when each stage of the ascent gives one a finer and finer view ? Ben Lawers burn itself is vvell worth a close inspection. Not, in deed, that it possesses much water, but, like a spendthrift, it is extremely prodigal of what it has, and the dash of the little flood has eaten its way deep into the mountain, so that, if you are on the top of the bank, the burn is sometimes (according to the nature of the ground) Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland lass ! Reaping and singing by herself. Stop here, or gently pass ! Alone she cuts and binds the grain, And sings a melancholy strain. Oh, listen ! for the vale profound Is overflowing with the sound.

Will no one tell me what she sings? Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago : Or is it some more humble lay, Familiar matter of to-day ?

But Ben Lawers still towers far above"], [296, "280 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. us, and if we wish to reach it in good time, we must not sit down here dream ing. Nor need we fear the task before us. Ben Lawers is one of the kindest of mountains. It seems formed for the express purpose of being climbed. There are no precipices over which one can tumble; there are no masses of stones over which it is necessary painfully to toil; the ascent is perfectly proportioned, and as you have the springy heather under your feet, and the free mountain breeze blowing in your face, the whole thing is more a pleasure than a toil. Well, here we are at the top. It is bright sunshine, and we feel rather warm after the forenoon's work, so we sit down and rest. Below is the whole extent of Loch Tay, from Killin to Kenmore, and in a ring round us is a perfect host of hills, very little lower than the one on which we are standing. Behind us, almost in a straight line, are Meall Gruaidh, Meall Garbh, Meall-a-chaire Leith, and the lower summit of Meall Luaidhe, and in front of us, on the other side of the Loch, are Meall \u2014 but the reader, no doubt, is inclined tocry, \" Hold, enough!\" for, unless he be himself a Highlander, he will not be in the habit of rolling these names \" like a sweet morsel under his tongue.\" sudden transformation had given us winter in the middle of summer. How ever, the disagreeable change vvas soon reversed. The wind fell as quickly as it had risen, the sun broke through the clouds, and these sullenly retired behind the mountains ; the wreathing sea of mist that surrounded us broke into sections, and disclosed Loch Tay in placid beauty at our feet. All again vvas quiet beauty, and the only memorials of the sudden commotion were our soaked garments and the water drop that loaded every sprig of heather, and glittered fresh in the sunlight. Ben Lawers burn rises in a small bit of water which lies in a sort of recess to the north of the mountain. It is called Lachan-a-Chait, which means, we be lieve, the Lake of the Wild-cats. It is a wild spot, not without a certain fascina tion of its own. If you go to the side of it you are shut in by the mountain which rises round you, save on the side where the burn issues forth, and even here you cannot see further than over a small extent of heather. The water is dark, and sullen, and deep. On a dim autumn day, when the clouds are drawn over the hills like a curtain, and no blink of sunlight lights up the darkness of the scene, there is something awe-inspiring in the place. If you stay too long the feeling becomes one of dull, dead de pression. There is no aspect of savage grandeur; no vast pile of rocks; no dreary precipices ; but, indeed, these would rather relieve the mind. You have nothing here but the black water, and the bare hillside, and the dark sky. And if you are a lover of old songs you will let some one of them float through your mind to relieve the feeling. Not a song of quiet and pensive feeling, as we had further down, but something like this, in keeping with the scene: \u2014 We have been twice on the top, and once very near the top of Ben Lawers. On the two occasions we by some strange chance saw the same sudden and unex pected change in the scenery; though, indeed, this is no very rare occurrence in the Highlands. It vvas bright sunshine as we ascended, but a sudden change came over the landscape as we neared the top. The sky darkened, clouds started out from behind the surrounding hills, and the wind rose in sudden fury, and a per fect downpour of hail and sleet descended on us. The mountain was soon wrapped in mist that hid the smiling valley at our feet, and prevented us seeing any dis tance, and the ground around us vvas powdered white in a few minutes. A As I was walking all alane, I heard twa corbies making a mean ; The tane unto the t'other gan say, \" Whaur sail we gang and dine to-day?\""], [297, "KILLIN LOCH TAY, AND KENMORE. 281 \"In behint yon auld sail dyke, I wot there lies a new-slain night ; And naebody kens that he lies there, But his hawk, his hound, and his lady fair. walk has absorbed the shieling. Into the general question of evictions it would be folly for us to enter. Our path is not amid such bitter controversies, nor could we spare the space even if we had the full and accurate knowledge required of those who can speak with authority on this difficult subject. Still, it may be permitted to us to say a word or two. It is, we may grant, desirable that the laws of Political Economy should be carried out ; but, after all, what are true laws of Political Economy ? Surely those which conduce to the well-being of the state as a whole; and the tables might possibly be turned were we to inquire whether the wholesale evictions were really for the benefit of the state as a whole, and whether the accumulation of land in large masses, and the practically despotic power which such accumulation gave to individuals, was really in accord ance with the laws of Political Economy. And then every man who thinks a little about human nature, will see that senti ment is a force which no one but a fool will neglect to take into account. Even if those who caused the evictions were right in their contentions that such evic tions were for the ultimate good of the evicted, it must be remembered that they could hardly plead this as their primary motive; and, besides, is it any real use doing such sort of dubious good turns to people against their will? The immedi ate effectof the measures was undoubtedly a great increase of human suffering, and it can hardly be said to be proved beyond dispute that this was tem porary, and the benefit lasting. With these few, and, we venture to hope, reasonable reflections, we leave this subject, and resume our course along Loch Tay. \" His hound is to the hunting gane, His hawk to fetch the wildfowl hame, His lady's ta'en another mate, Sae we may mak' our dinner sweet. \" Ye sail sit on his white hause bane, And I'll pyke out his bonny blue een, Wi' ae lock o' his gowden hair, We'll theek our nest when it grows bare. \" Mony a ane for him makes mean, But nane sail ken whaur he is gane ; O'er his white banes when they are bare, The wind sail blaw for evermair.\" Much of Highland scenery partakes of this dark, gloomy, melancholy aspect ; perhaps, during the greater part of the year, all of it is like this. The natural tendency of it is to produce a melancholy cast of thought. The dark shadows that lie on the hillside sink into the minds of the people. And w'hat race is so susceptible to natural influences as the Celt? Place his stock in the \"plea sant land of France,\" amidst sunshine and fertile fields and \"hills that bear the vine,\" and you have a careless, light-hearted, almost insolently and defiantly gay peo ple. Place it in the Highlands, amidst barren hills, and mists and rain and cold, and you have a melancholy, brood ing race. It has been said, indeed, that the Highlanders are insensible to the beauty of Highland scenery, and this is no doubt partially true. But it only means that the associations of toil and struggle, and want and cold are so inti mately connected with their mountains, that they fail to apprehend the pictu resqueness of the scenery amidst which they live. But for all this they are pro foundly affected by it. They have a passionate love of their own, too, for their native glens and hills. So we re member as we see, far up in a sheltered corner of Ben Lawers, some ruined huts, and reflect in how many places in the Highlands, the deer-forest or the sheep- Drummond Hill seems a very small height after those we have just passed, but it is finely wooded, and as it rises almost sheer from the road, it is never passed without some notice.

King Robert was delighted when he heard of this exploit. Here was a churchman after his own heart, and he forthwith decreed that this should be his bishop in future, and so Sinclair appears in history as the king's own bishop. The twenty-third bishop was** John Rolston, a dignified ecclesiastic and statesman, and yet a man of but little account in history, and whose name it would not be worth our while to men- tion were it not that one incident in his life seems to cast a striking side-light on the better part of the temper of the times. He was much occupied in carry- ing on the building of the cathedral. The nave and aisle were being built of small stones, which were laboriously conveyed to the spot on horseback, from a distance. So eager was the bishop, that every day he repaired to the quarry, not merely to oversee, but to co-operate with the labourers, and he might be seen after every visit, laboriously toiling up the hill with a great load of stones on his back. What gives a certain ideal charm to this story of a humble devotion, is that he could not expect to see the end of his labours ; he had re- ceived the cathedral unfinished, and un- finished he would hand it down to posterity. Still, something would be done, although the rude appliances of that age could not do much. He and his fellows laboured, well knowing that not they, but other men, would enjoy the fruits of their labours. So we think, when we look on the ruins of an old cathedral, of the steady faith and pious trust of the succeeding generations that built it, and whom it and its associations I we follow the river Tay till it oins the Tum- *nel, we find our- selves in the cen- :re of a number of places of interest. own the river is^ Dunkeld, under the Culdees the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland. Thither the bones of St. Columba were carried. and here they were cherished as precious relics, and reputed to have worked many wonders. The cathedral was begun some time in the fourteenth cen tury. The choir is still used as a parish church, though the whole building was terribly mutilated at the Reformation. It was the church of a number of very famous and eminent bishops, of whom several deserve special mention. The eleventh bishop was William Sinclair, of the Roslin family, \" the lordly line of high St. Clair,\" as Scott calls them, and sometimes the instincts of a warrior race broke through the training of the priest. In 13 1 7, a party of English marauders had landed in Fife. They were nume rous and well armed, and the whole population fled in consternation before them. They moved northward, and in vaded the good bishop's diocese. He \" waxed mighty wroth,\" left his episcopal palace, and with stern upbraiding re called the frightened fugitives to their duty. He placed himself at their head, and, spear in hand, led them against the invaders.

Our thoughts of those places are too much influenced by our knowledge of the disgraceful doings, just before the Re formation of the Church to which they belonged. But when these were planned, that Church vvas as pure as the one that succeeded it. In Scotland at least, the foundation of the ecclesiastical buildings belongs to a period when all that was best and highest in the national life was consecrated by the Church. It vvas the one bond of unity that connected a wild people among themselves, and made a savage nation a recognised member of the great European family. It was the one thing in common that they had with their English enemies, and savage as their wars were, they would have been still more so were it not for the restrain ing influence of a common belief. The Earl of Angus, his nephew, had married the queen regent, and she made him Archbishop of St. Andrew's. But the chapter refused to elect, and the pope to confirm, so this had to be given up. He vvas then made Bishop of Dun keld, but just then Albany was made regent, and he trumped up a charge against him, and threw him into a dun geon in Edinburgh Castle. In about a year he made his peace with Albany, and was consecrated by James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow. This prelate was a very different sort of man from the gentle Gavin, and one incident where we see them together is so illustrative of the wit of the one priest, and the violence of the other, that it may well deserve a place here. The foes of the Earl of Angus planned an attack on him in Edinburgh. Gavin heard of it, and besought his brother ecclesiastic, who belonged to the opposite faction, to do what he could to preserve peace, for such he urged was his duty as a priest. But the bishops of those days had, it must be confessed, a hard time of it. On one occasion the Clan Donachie had fallen out with his lordship's factor, who had imprisoned one of them. Immedi ately the clan collected and marched to the rescue. They entered the church whilst the bishop was engaged singing mass, and began to fire arrows at him. His lordship fled to the choir in the most undignified fashion. He was there followed, and forced to come to terms. Beaton \"protested on his conscience that he had no concern with the matter,\" and to give his assertion force, smote his breast with incautious vehemence, when lo ! an ominons rattle revealed the ex istence of a coat of mail under the episcopal vestments! Beaton's confu sion was not lessened by the neat retort of his brother prelate \u2014 \"I hear, my Lord, your conscience clattering.\" A smart sally this, and the better when we remember that clatter, be sides its ordinary meaning, is also used in Scotch \" for an indiscreet betrayal of a secret which it is intended to keep.\" For a few years Gavin fulfilled the duties of his office with zeal and fidelity, but he was not allowed long to retain his post. In 152 1 he was compelled, owing to the decline of the Angus party, The brightest name on the list of bishops is that of Gavin Douglas. According to Scott, though A noble Lord of Douglas blood, With mitre sheen, and rocquet white ; Yet showed his meek and thoughtful eye But little pride of prelacy, More pleased that in a barbarous age, He gave rude Scotland Virgil's page, Than that beneath his rule he held The bishopric of fair Dunkeld.

He died of the plague, in 1522, and lies in the Savoy Chapel. A brass plate bearing his name and rank, with a brief epitaph, marks his grave. There is something pathetic in his history.

But this same Gavin is remembered, whilst the others are \" unwept, un honoured, and unsung,\" and Dunkeld gains glory from the connection. \" Dunkeld, no more the heaven-directed chaunt Within thy sainted walls may sound again, But thou, as once the Muse's favourite haunt, Shall live in Douglas' pure Virgilian strain, While time devours the castle's crumbling wall, And roofless abbeys pine, low-tottering to their fall.\" The bishops of Dunkeld were, as we have seen, great warriors as well as priests, and, indeed, with the exception of Douglas, they did not shine in thiscapacity. One of the last of them, in a trial for heresy, at which he vvas a judge, de voutly thanked God that he never knew either the Old or the New Testament, and, as he complacently remarked, \"he had prospered vvell enough ! \" The Bishop's best work is a translation of Virgil's \"\u00c6neid.\" To each book there is prefixed an original prologue. These exhibit a fine feeling for the beauties of nature, and are expressed in such flowing and melodious language as to justify us in assigning to their author a high place among the Scottish poets. From \" King Hart,\" an allegorical poem, we give, as a specimen of his work, two stanzas ofthe first canto: \u2014 The famous Black Watch were raised here in 1739. There is a splendid monument in the cathedral to the memory of those who fell in war, erected in 1872. Another famous regiment, the Cameronians, here performed a doughty deed of valour. It was immediately after Killiecrankie, a battle about which we shall say something in a little while, and the Lowlanders were depressed, the High landers elated by that brilliant combat. These last were flocking rapidly to their standards, and had they had an able chief, it is just possible that they might have really shaken the new government. All danger of this vvas put an end to by the events, which we now narrate. The newly-raised Cameronian regiment had been sent North to assist in uphold ing the cause of the new government. It was composed of \" pharisees of the pharisees,\" men whose hatred ot King Hart, into his cumlie castell strang, Closit about with craft and meikill ure, So seimlie wes he set his folk amang, That he no dout had of misaventure : So proudlie wes he polist, plaine, anil pure, With youtheid and his lustie levis grene ; So fair, so fresche, so liklie to endure, And als so blyth, as bird in symmer schene.

Emboldened by their successes, a party now sallied out against the village, the houses of which had been occupied by shooting parties, and set fire to the houses one after the other. With that re lentless hate which vvas one of their most marked characteristics, they locked the doors of the houses wherever they could. As many as sixteen men were burned in one house. This sort of thing went on all day. At last, in the late twilight of the summer night, the discomfited as;ailants made off almost in confusion to the hills. The Cameronians, \" upon their retreating, gave a great shout, and threw up their caps in the air, and then all joined in offering up praises to God a considerable time for so miraculous a victory.\" Whether the victory was miraculous or no, it vvas, at any rate, emphatically decisive. The whole moral effect of the victory at Killiecrankie was reversed, the zeal of the Highlanders was damped, and instead of collecting in larger numbers, those who had already collected began to disperse. their opponents vvas a \" hatred heated in the furnace of enthusiasm, and hardened on the anvil of persecution. Both knew and abhorred each other ; but the Covenanter had a special ground of wrath against that savage horde, that in the evil hour of perse- cution had been let loose upon him like the wild beasts of old upon the Christian martyrs.\" Colonel William Cleland vvas their leader. He vvas not yet thirty, and yet had fought at Drum- clog and Bothwell Bridge, and had been specially marked out for vengeance by the Stewarts. He vvas an accomplished poet as well as an able general, and had not his life closed \u2014 in no inglorious man- ner \u2014 on that day he might have risen to high eminence. The garrison vvas posted in the Cathedral tower and Dun- keld House. These they proceeded to fortify, Sunday though it vvas. The hills round them were soon crowded with Highlanders watching them, and getting ready for the attack. There was some brief exchange of messages before the actual fighting. \" We, the gentlemen assembled,\" said the Highlanders, \"be- ing informed that ye intend to burn the toun, desire to know whether ye come for peace or war, and to certify you that, if ye burn any house, we will destroy you.\" The reply was equally brief and pointed. \"We are faithful subjects to King William and Queen Mary, and enemies to their enemies, and if ye who send these threats shall make any hostile appearance, we will burn all that belongs to you, and otherwise de stroy you as ye deserve.\" In one respect this battle has a certain resemblance to Killiecrankie; as the victors then had lost their chief, so the victors now lost theirs. At the begin ning of the fight Cleland stepped for ward, and into full view of the enemy, in order to give some special injunction. Two shots instantly struck him. He fell mortally wounded, and expired almost immediately. On the other side of the Tay, a little lower down than Dunkeld, is Birnam. Twelve miles to the south-east is Dunsi nane Hill. It is 1,084 feet high. The top is flat and verdant, as are also the sides, though much broken by projecting masses of rock. Of the vast fortress which Macbeth erected here, hardly a vestige remains. The reader will re member how, when Macbeth goes to consult the witches, the apparition of a child crowned, with a tree in his hand, rises and prophecies thus : \u2014 The contest did not come till Wednes day. Then the Highlanders made their attack in their usual manner, firing their guns, and charging sword in hand. But their defenders were well posted, and well commanded, and more than all, were well trained, and knowing how to fight, did not know how to yield. The Highlanders, confident of victory, found themselves unexpectedly repulsed, and"], [303, "DUNKELD. 287 Macbeth shall never vanquished be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane Hill This, therefore, is done forthwith, and Macbeth finds himself tricked !

The Pield of Killiecrankie. \u25a0JR way is now up the Tay river, through Dunkeld parish and into Logierait. At the insignificant little hamlet of that name there are one or two things worth mentioning; it was once a royal residence, and here was a palace and a hunting-seat of the Scottish kings. It is on a charge of cattle stealing, but sub sequent inquiries proved his innocence. It vvas supposed that a sudden flood which soon afterwards arose, drowned the justiciary and swept away his house, was a direct visitation of Heaven upon an unjust judge. The abolition of this jurisdiction was one of the indirect good results of the unsuccessful rising of 1745. We have, however, now left the Tay for the Garry, and passed into the parish of Moulin, and our principal purpose in going into this region is to give some account of the famous battle of Killie crankie, which, although abortive, has yet acquired a certain celebrity from the rapid and exciting nature of the combat, and the fact that it was the last effort in Britain to withstand the revolution of 1688. The battle gets yet a deeper interest from the fact that it terminated the career of Viscount Dundee. Something, too, is due to the fact that the conflict occurred in the most re markable scenery, and though a rail way running through it has defaced it, yet this has also brought many to see it, and kept it before the public eye, better known as the \" seat of the court of regality, in which the Lords of Athole administered feudal justice, from the twelfth century to the abolition of hereditary jurisdiction in 1748. Hence its name, according to some etymologists, Logie meaning a hollow, and rait mean ing arbitration and settlement of differ ences \u2014 Logierait thus meaning the hollow in which differences were judici ally settled.\" Many stories are told of the rough-and-ready manner in which justice, if we can call it so, vvas ad ministered, and how the criminals, after being tried in the most summary man ner by the Duke's deputies, were led through the Clais-nan-dcoir, or Hollow of Tears, to the Tam-na- Croich, or Hill ofthe Gallows. One Donald Dhu was said to have been the last person hanged here. He vvas just about being turned off, when a woman appeared in frantic pursuit of a cow, which she could find nowhere. The advantages of Donald's elevated position at once struck her, for she addressed him thus : \u2014 \" Hech, mon, you that up there sae heich, gie a look round and see if you can see ony o' my kye round about.\" \" Haud yer tongue, ye horrible woman,\" was poor Donald's not unnatural reply; \" her-nain-sel was never so angry sin she pe porn.\" Donald was put to death The pass of Killiecrankie is one of the steepest and wildest in the Highlands. The banks rise almost sheer out of the water that foams at the foot, rushing in white and broken masses over the huge stones which impede its course, or, in some places where, in course of time, it has worn the surface smooth, gliding along, dark, dangerous-looking, and rapid. The sides, steep as they are, seem quite covered with trees as we look up. The oak, the alder, the birch, and the ash grow out of every corner. The pass itself is a sort of cutting be tween two valleys. And it was to gain the top of these that General Mackay"], [305, "THE FIELD OF KILLIECRANKIE. 289 marched with his soldiers just before the battle. Why he got himself into such a position it is hard to understand ; he certainly supposed that the pass and adjacent parts were quite in possession of his own men, and did not know that the enemy were so near. The troops on the other side were not, indeed, a regular army, but they were admirably fitted for mountain warfare \u2014 with his foot on his native heath the Highlander is irresistible. The general who led them was one who well understood the work to be done and the instruments with which he had to do it. Viscount Dundee is one of those Scotchmen whose name is indelibly connected with many spots of their native land, and so in moving over the country we come across him again and again. Asa soldier, how ever, his chief fame must always rest on Killiecrankie, and the events that pre ceded it, and it is only as a soldier that we here consider him. Nothing is more remarkable than the skill and patience with which he, whose name in the Low lands vvas a very byword for savage rage, soothed the feelings and com posed the differences of the Highland chiefs who led the divisions of his army. Often, indeed, must he have cursed the idiotic pride and mad conceit of those who put everything to risk for a point of etiquette, but he never showed what he felt. Now with a timely jest, again with a banquet, and now again by the use of personal influence he made up the quarrels and feuds of centuries. His skill, his patience, his tact, his courage, made him the darling of the army. How important he vvas to the cause of the Stewarts his death showed. pass might reveal a band of the enemy strongly posted \u2014 for a very few men could have completely barred the way. However, they got through the steepest part of the pass, and attained a small plain just beyond. But the ground con tinued to rise from this part, and there on the heights were the enemy seen preparing to dash down on them. The army found themselves caught in a trap. They could not retreat through the nar row pass in the straggling order in which they had come, nor could they advance up the hill in face of the enemy. They had no resource but to prepare to receive the enemy, when it should please him to attack them. In the meantime the sharpshooters on the Highland side amused themselves by picking off the officers that comprised Mackay's staff, whilst the \"three small leathern can non \" which that general possessed were fired in vain at the attacking army. Mackay had something less than 4,000 men, and Claverhouse a little more than half that number. The Lowland line was three deep ; their opponents were massed into clans. There is a very fine rhetorical oration purporting to be the speech which Claverhouse delivered to his troops on this memorable occasion. As they did not understand one another's language, it is probable that this oration must be taken as representing rather the thoughts than words of Dundee. General Mackay spoke to his men \" a few homely sentences about the preser vation of their religion and liberties.\" Such speeches, however suitable to the occasion, can never be expected to have any real effect. They are but the rhetorical flowers which cover the rock of fact, which they serve to adorn, though they cannot change its nature. Something more really eloquent, and likewise more' \" germane to the matter\" was the wild shout which the High landers gave as they charged, and which we are told was noted as contrast ing with the faint cheer which their Mackay's army vvas composed of \" fresh recruits, and old soldiers trained in the wars of the low countries ; \" and these, as in narrow file they struggled along the dangerous road, felt anything tut easy as they gazed now at the rocks above them, and now at the torrent at their feet, dreading that each turn of the"], [306, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 290 already dispirited opponents gave as they prepared to meet them. The battle did not begin till late in the day, for the sun shone full in the face of the Highlanders, and Dundee restrained them till it had sunk behind the hills ; but indeed the result could never have for a moment been doubted. The High landers swept on to the attack like the mountain torrent that thundered down the narrow pass. The troops fired, and whilst they were fixing their bayonets their foes were among them. Instantly Mackay's army was swept away, and pursuers and pursued disappeared in the pass. In the description of the fight whichthat general gave, he has described with a kind of ludicrous pathos the aspect of affairs as it appeared to him. \"In the twinkling of an eye, in a manner, our men, as well as the enemy, were out of sight, being got down pell-mell to the river, where our baggage stood.\" At which sad spectacle it may be easily judged how he was surprised to see at first view himself alone upon the battle field. The battle vvas already over, and already also Claverhouse had fallen. He was seen \" to wave his hat over his head, as he rose in the stirrups to signal his troops onward.\" A bullet, fired by chance or design, struck him at the moment, and he fell from his horse mortally wounded. As those about him anxiously raised the dying man, he faintly asked how the day went. One of the soldiers told him that \"it went vvell for the king, but he was sorry for him.\" He answered \"that it mattered not for himself, if the day went vvell for the king.\" But, indeed, the day could not go vvell for the king when it went badly for Dundee, and the bullet that killed him was fatal not merely to him, but to the cause he represented. first delivered in a very exaggerated form, and without the important qualifica tion that Dundee had fallen, vvas received at Edinburgh with very mixed feelings, though consternation vvas the pre dominant one, as the new government had the undoubted support of the great majority of the people. But three things soon utterly destroyed the effect of the victory. It vvas known in a short time that Dundee had fallen, and so feared w7as he, that the defeat actually from that moment had the moral effect of a victory. Then we have the skilful generalship of Mackay, who soon col lected his forces, and retreated in such an able manner that he covered the Lowlands; finally there vvas the stubborn and successful defence of Dunkeld by the Cameronians, which was of such a nature that, as we have seen, it com pletely damped the variable spirits of the Highlanders. Thus the battle of Killiecrankie stands in history as an isolated effect \u2014 a sub ject fitter for the poet and the romance writer than the historian. It has been the subject of several popular bal lads. In the \" Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers,\" Aytoun has told the story in spirit-stirring lines, and Wordsworth, too, has given us a fine sonnet, which we may repeat as concluding our account of the matter. Six thousand veterans practised in war's game, Tried men, at Killiecrankie were array'd Against an equal host that wore the plaid, Shepherds and herdsmen. Like a whirlwind came The Highlanders, the slaughter spread like flame ; And Garry, thund'ring down his mountain-road, Was stopp'd, and could not breathe beneath the load Of the dead bodies.

It vvas built of timber, in the midst of a great meadow, and sur rounded by moats, or fosses, full of the most delicate fish. It was enclosed and defended by towers, as if it had been a regular castle, and had within it many apartments, which were decked with flowers and branches, so that in treading them one seemed to be in a garden. Here were all kinds of game, and other provisions in abundance, with many cooks to make them ready, and plenty of the most costly spices and wines. The Italian ambassador was greatly sur prised to see, amongst rocks and wilder nesses, which seemed to be the very extremity of the world, such good lodging and so magnificent an entertainment. But what surprised him most of all, was to see the Highlanders set fire to the wooden castle as soon as the hunting was over, and the king in the act of Here, foaming down the shelvy rocks, In twisting strength I rin ; There, high my boiling torrent smokes, Wild roaring o'er a linn : Enjoying large each spring and well, As nature gave them me, I am, altho' I say't mysel, Worth gaun a mile to see.

He who pitied the mouse and the hare, and the daisy crushed by the plough, does not now forget the trouts. But why do we linger in pleasure grounds, however fine ? In this magni ficent sporting country there is something to-day far better for us to do. We must have some sport; the day is dark and warm, and here we have the very stream for the purpose; is it not called the stream-abounding-in-salmon (this is ex pressed by one term in the graphic Gaelic language ! ) ? There is in it many a dark pool overhung with willows \u2014 fit abode of the stately fish.

All day we have sought him; pools that looked so inviting as they lay dark and quiet under the shadow ofthe surrounding rocks, have been tried in vain, and made us repeat many ancient and somewhat threadbare reflections as to the vanity of human wishes; but other proverbs tell us of the rewards of per severance, and surely this pool, so cool, so deep, so carefully guarded, even on the brightest day, from the obtrusive The lightly-jumpin' glowrin' trouts, That thro' my waters play, If, in their random, wanton spouts, They near the margin stray ; If, hapless chance 1 they linger lang, I'm scorching up to shallow, They're left the whitening stanes amang, In gasping death to wallow.

We let the fly play for a moment in the dripping water that feeds the pool, when suddenly a mighty mass of silver rises from the deeps, and with a rapid forward movement our fly is safely lodged in (it is to be hoped) our salmon, who, with a flap of satisfaction, settles himself down to renewed meditation in the dark abyss. He considers the busi ness, it is evident, as finished. We are obliged to differ from him, however, and so, by gentle pressure, we urge him to come forth, which he does ; hardly with a good grace, though, as he darts here and there in the pool, giving us a good deal of trouble to keep our line free from the entanglement of the willows. At last he comes to the conclusion that this sort of thing wont do at all, and so off he goes at a fine pace. But if he means business, so do we, and off we go after him. Now we are struggling waist deep in some pool; now we are wading over slippery stones where we can scarcely keep our feet; now we are moving in a pleasanter way along the bank, here level with the water; and, again, we are crawling under the branches of the trees. Sometimes our salmon grows a little sullen, and lies away in some convenient corner; but, alas for him, that unlucky \u2014 mouthful we were going to say, but tit-bit is more like the reality, has de livered him into our hands, and by means of the hold we have on him, we soon get him en voyage again. He is not so fresh, now, however; we feel that his tug at the line is not nearly so vigorous as it vvas earlier in the chase. He has not dragged us after him all this way for nothing; and now here is a shelving beach, and with an artful move we have him near the shore, and in a minute he is landed, and safely in our possession. But now the \" sun has stretched out all the hills,\" for he reappears when his pre sence would do us no harm, and so we cram our salmon (he is huge of size) into the fishing-basket, and set our face homewards with a feeling of happy tired ness, which is something very different from the weary exhaustion that some times falls upon us in the city."], [310, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 294 LOCH EARN, AND ENTRANCE TO GLEN OGLE.

Is it heresy to say that many Highland lochs, and nearly all Highland mountains, bear a family resemblance? and so we only need present what is new to the reader. \" And now for Loch Men teith, and our last word about Perthshire. The loch is a small one \u2014 only seven miles round \u2014 and its characteristic is the soft air of repose that broods over it. The chief interest about it is con cerned with two islands, on both of which there are considerable remains. One island is Inch-talla, the other Inchma home, or Isle of Rest. The first of these islands was occupied by the Earls of Menteith. On the other was a religious foundation, endowed by Edgar, King of Scotland. Here, after the \" rough woo ing \" of Queen Mary by Henry the Eighth for his son, and the battle of Pinkie, in which it culminated, she was conveyed for security. And could there have been a more charming place for the child queen than this island, \" set in its woods with its magical shadows and soft gleams ? There is a loneliness, a gentleness, and a peace about it more like lone St. Mary's Lake or Derwent Water than of any of its sister lochs. It is lonely rather than beautiful, and is a sort of gentle prelude, in the minor key, to the comingglories and intenser charms of Loch Ard, and the true Highlands beyond.\" The battle of Pinkie vvas fought on the 9th of September, 1547, and immediately thereafter Mary was removed to this quiet spot, where she would be in the hands of sure friends, and whence, if there was need, she could be removed to the Highlands, in whose inaccessible retreats she would be safe from the pursuit of her royal wooer. Her education vvas carefully superin tended by John Erskine, the prior, and Alexander Scott, incumbent of Balmacel lan, her tutor. She vvas attended by her four maids-of-honour, the celebrated Queen Marys; and here she wandered. \"her shining hair, which, in childhood, was of a bright golden yellow, bound with a rose-coloured satin snood, wear ing a tartan scarf over black silk, fastened with a golden agrafe, engraved with the united arms of Scotland and Lorraine.\" A charming picture this of the Scottish child-queen. One memorial of her is still to be seen there, and of this Dr. John Brown, the author whom we have already quoted, thus writes : \u2014 \" You find, on landing, huge Spanish chestnuts are lying dead, others standing stark and peeled, like gigantic antlers, and others flourishing in their viridis senedus, and in a thicket of wood you see the remains of a monastery of great beaut}7, the design and workmanship exquisite. You wander through the ruins, over grown with ferns and Spanish filberts and old fruit trees, and at the corner of the old monkish garden you come upon one of the strangest and most touching sights you ever saw \u2014 an oval space of about eighteen feet by twelve, with the remains of a double row of boxwood all round, the plants of box being about fourteen feet high, and eight or nine inches in diameter, healthy, but plainly of great age. What is this ? It is called in the guide-books Queen Mary's Bovver; but, besides its being plainly not in the least a bower, what could the little queen, then five years old, and surely fancy free, do with a bovver ? It is the child-queen's garden, with her little walk and its rows of boxwood, left to themselves for three hundred years. Yes, without doubt, here is the first garden of her simpleness. Fancy the little lovely royal child, with her four Marys, her playfellows, her child maids-of-honour, with their little hands and feet, and their innocent and happy eyes, pattering about that garden all that time long ago, laughing and running and gardening as only children do and can.

Were we Mr. Tenny son, we would write an idyll of that child queen, in that garden of hers, eating her bread and honey \u2014 getting her teaching from the holy men, the monks of old, and running off in wild mirth to her garden and her flowers, all unconscious of the black lowering thunder-cloud on Ben Lomond's shoulder. As you linger there amid ' the gleams, the shadows, and the peace profound,' your mind is informed with quietness and beauty, filled with thoughts of other years, and of her whose story, like Helen of Troy's, will continue to move the hearts of men as long as the grey hills stand about that gentle lake, and are mirrored at evening in its depths.\" She was only a few months here, however.

One of the sons of the Menteith family fell in love with a nun, who dwelt in the religious founda- tion of Inchmahome. At night, when all was still, he crept down to the shores of the loch, and waited the approach of the boat in which the nun was accus- tomed to row herself from the island, and there, in his arms, she vowed to incur temporal and eternal ruin for his dear sake ; and now all the preparations were made, and the night was fixed when she was to leave her island home with him, and rejoin the world. Before the time came the youth got engaged in some wild brawl, and fell mortally wounded. A priest was called to hear his last confession, and to him he con- fessed that he had dared to woo the bride of heaven! The priest learned all the particulars ofthe proposed meeting, and, dressing himself in the lover's garb, he repaired to the appointed place. And now the lady, with anxiety and hope burning in her heart, left the con- vent and vvas making for the shore. She neared it, and recognised, as she thought, her lover's form; but as she stepped ashore the figure started for- ward, and she saw before her the stern face and shaven head of the priest. With a wild shriek she fell backwards into the water. Next day her lifeless body vvas interred in the Nun's Hill, \"upright,\" as is reported. No prayers were said over the grave or in the little chapel for the repose of one who was deemed to have died in mortal sin. But the other dwellers on the island thought sometimes that during wild nights, when the wind moaned unceas- ingly in the lofty tree-tops, and drifting clouds only allowed an occasional glimpse of moonlight to fall on the troubled waters of the loch, they could hear the shrill wailing cry ot a woman's agony, and could even see, it was averred, a figure dressed as a nun move rapidly over the hill. The island is a tolerably large one \u2014 about four acres in superficies \u2014 and it has other interesting memories besides the one we have noted. The priory pre cincts were used as a burying-ground, and here lie the remains of many noble families. There are still monuments extant to the memory of Walter Stewart, fifth earl of Menteith, who was one ofthe competitors, along with Bruce and Baliol, for the Scottish crown, and to some mem bers of the families of Drummond and Graham. Here, also, is buried Lord Kilpont, first earl of Menteith and Airth, who joined Montrose, and was immediately therefor killed by Stewart of Ardvoirlerich, though how or why it is impossible exactly to say. This assassination had some important effects, for it was followed by the immediate secession of Kilpont' s men \u2014 a loss which seriously hampered Montrose.

They were not always so successful in getting rid of their enemies as on the following occasion, of which we repeat the traditionary account, though we cannot vouch for its authen ticity. Donald, Lord of the Isles, on one occasion collected a great body of warriors and made an incursion into these parts. He encamped before Inverness, and threatened to burn down the city unless a most enormous ransom vvas forthwith paid to him. The towns people were in despair, but the Provost, \" douce man,\" had a most ingenious plan, which he forthwith proceeded to put into execution. He sent a messenger to the barbarians, and said that the council were busy considering the terms, and meantime some refreshments were sent to console the Highlanders whilst waiting. Among them was a liquid speci ally recommended to Donald's attention. It was clear as spring water, had a penetrating odour, and a burning yet not wholly unpleasant taste. As Donald quaffed it, it seemed to infuse new life into him; the blood moved more swiftly in his veins, and glad and happy thoughts filled his soul. His savage breast vvas soothed, and a genial feeling of kind liness and comfort diffused itself over his huge frame. His attendants noticed that unwonted fire sparkled in his eyes, and at his invitation they too partook of the generous liquid, and like pleasing results followed, and soon the camp of the rough Islesmen was a scene of genial mirth. Alas, the liquor had another effect. A remarkable feeling of drowsiness fell bit by bit on the revellers. Donald, after much wild shouting and exuberant glee, lay stretched at ease full length on the turf, and soon his clansmen, disposed in every conceivable attitude, lay at rest with him, and over him, and around him. Ah, well did the cunning Provost know the effect of the liquid \u2014 had he not frequently proved it on his person and on that of his brother magistrates ? \u2014 and If Inverness has a right to the proud title of the capital of the Highlands, it has had on several occasions to pay the penalty of greatness. In 1229 it was attacked by a set of wild Highland caterans under the leadership of an individual with the extraordinary name of Gillespick McScourlane, who is de scribed as a \" turbulent and potent Highland ruffian.\" He had the temerity to attempt to establish a small king dom in these parts, but being seized, was instantly beheaded. This vvas during the reign of Alexander the Second, who gave the town two charters, and founded therein a monastery of friars.

On the north the Ness is spanned by the New Bridge, and from this Chapel-street and its continuations, Academy-street and Church-street, branch out and run parallel to the bank. Meeting these at right angles, and terminating them, is High-street, which is continued in Bridge street, and carried over the river by a suspension bridge. The chief buildings are the Castle, the ruins of Cromwell's fort, and the Cathedral, which is situated on the other side of the river. This last is a remarkably fine building, and was, until the erection of the new cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church in Edinburgh, the only modern cathedral in Scotland. As it wants, however, the charm of historical association, and has no importance save for the communion for which it is intended, we shall leave it with this word of notice. this vvas just what they had all waited for ; so now without delay the gates were thrown open, and the citizens, sword in hand, marched courageously to the attack. Their foes were effectually hors de combat, and entirely at their mercy, and the slaughter vvas fearful.

The descendants of Loban have, however, constantly forsworn this fluid, which is not to be wondered at. The wild chieftains were not discou raged by this slaughter, for in 1426, and again in 1455, different Lords of the Isles descended on the unfortunate city, and wasted it with fire and sword. The town has various associations with several of the Scottish kings, as those generally made it their residence when they moved northward. James I. held a Parliament here in 1427, and Queen Mary resided in it a part of the time during her northern journey occasioned by the Huntly rising. It also figured in the Jacobite risings of the '15 and the '45, but then it sunk into comparative insignificance. It is now, however, the centre of a great touring district, and has rapidly lost most of the old out-of the-way appearance which used to impress the traveller in contemplating its streets and its inhabitants. Amidst a great increase of material prosperity one misses the quaint charm that used to hang over the place in past years. The greatest part of the modern town is built on the right side of the river Ness, which flows past in a sort of serpentine fashion. A succession of Although we have said that Inverness was something of a primitive place, it must not be supposed that this implied that its inhabitants were boorish. Quite the reverse ; the natural politeness of the Celt was never to be seen to more advantage than in this old town, and we are glad to record the general opinion of travellers that something of this still lingers, amidst much that is changed. There is a rather conceited saying current in the place that the best English is spoken at Inverness, which is true with some important qualifications. The common people do indeed speak much better than the Cockney inhabitant of London, or the peasant of Dorset. English is to them a new language introduced in a state of purity, and yet it is familiar enough to make them speak it without awkwardness. In the case of the Lowland Scot, his own tongue becomes mixed with the new one, and then, moreover, it is so like it that he is not absolutely obliged to learn a new one to express his thoughts. Perhaps, also, something ought to be"], [317, "FAIR INVERNESS- 301 credited to the superior fineness and delicacy of the Celtic character.

The population of the county has been steadily increasing for the last thirty or forty years, but it is not yet so high as it was in 1 841, when it numbered 97,799 ; in 188 1 it was 90,414. The chief interest of Inverness for us, is its association with the house of Stewart. Near it is Cullo den, where the battle that crushed the hopes of that house was fought, and as a transition from town to moor we may take these lines of Burns, in which the two are poetically linked together, and which expresses so well what must have been the sentiments of many of the townspeople at the result of the fight : \u2014 We cannot leave Inverness without mentioningthe Clack- na-Cuda in, or\"Stone of the Tub,\" on which women used to place this useful vessel in order to have a short rest as they carried up water from the river.

It is now built into a fountain erected in front of the recently finished Town Hall, and so its associa tions, if not with tubs, are still with water.

A fleet of provision ships kept pace with the north ward movement ofthe army. On the 15th the Duke was at Nairn, and the High landers at Culloden. The Prince's troops were badly provisioned, and they were far inferior to their opponents in artillery. It vvas thought, therefore, that a night attack might advantageously be made, for in such a case the mechanical discipline of a regularly-drilled soldiery would avail them little, and their heavy artillery not at all. It is said that the Duke of Cumberland was prepared for such an event ; but still the design seemed a good one. There was some thing in it congenial to the daring and adventurous spirit of the High landers, and this and other events show that the Prince had a real genius for generalship, and well understood the nature of the troops whom he com manded. The want of provisions spoiled all, and from this moment a series of un fortunate incidents began, that termi nated in the utter ruin of the army. The commissariat, indeed, was, even after taking all extenuating circumstances into account, exceptionally poor and bad. The men were half-starved, and had dispersed to collect provisions. They sullenly told their officers who or dered them to assemble, that they might shoot them if they chose, but that they would not come together till they had had food. At seven o'clock only very few were under arms, and they were still slowly collecting when eight o'clock \u2014 the time appointed for the starting of the ex pedition \u2014 struck. Notwithstanding this, Lord George Murray set off with the advance guard. The rear followed HERE are few names in Scotch history which con- vey so many me- lancholy associa- tions as that of Culloden.

Yet, when we put aside the many dis turbing reflections that obscure the matter at issue, one or two clear facts which it is vvell to note may be stated. We see how hopeless the in surrection was from the very first.

Yet they could ill afford to do this, for they had wandered over the dreary moor in the thick blackness of the night, and were far behind time already. They halted in the darkness that precedes dawn, and began to consider their posi tion. They could not commence the attack before daylight, and what chance had it then of success ? Moreover, they heard in the distance sounds that con vinced them that all was watchfulness in the royal camp. They gave up their de sign, and sadly and wearily retraced their steps. At last, utterly exhausted and famished, they reachedCulloden, andthere lay down on the ground to rest, but the enemy were already on their track. The Prince had been bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the project for the night attack. It had a certain ominous re semblance to the retreat from Derby, which he was accustomed to regard as the beginning of all his misfortunes. He thus declined a proposal made to him by some of his more prudent officers, that the whole army should retreat to the mountains, where the Duke of Cumberland could not reach them. But indeed there was no time for retreat, for already the enemy were upon them. of expected support.\" The Jacobite army was formed in two lines, flanked with artillery. There was also artillery in the centre. The Duke formed his men in three lines, flanked with cavalry, and interspersed with artillery. His troops were in excellent spirits, and eager to fight. When they first caught sight of the enemy they had raised a lusty cheer, to which the Highlanders had answered with wild yells. When the Duke had formed them into line, he addressed them in a few words, which, if somewhat prosaic, were at least honest and straightforward. \" I do not sup pose,\" he said, \"that there is a soldier before me unwilling to fight ; but should there be any, who either from disincli nation to the cause, or from having relations in the rebel army, prefer to retire, in God's name, I beg them to do so now. I would rather face the High landers with one thousand men at my back, determined to fight, than with ten thousand, of whom a tithe are luke warm.\" The battle began with a can nonade on both sides. Charles's army suffered terribly, and did but little execu tion in return. They became impatient, and clamorously demanded to be led against the enemy. The order vvas at length given to attack, but it vvas not given simultaneously, and in some what disorderly array, yet forgetting in the mad excitement of the charge all their previous fatigue and hunger, the High landers rushed on the foe. This was the decisive moment of the battle; were this charge successful, as it had been at Gladsmuir and Falkirk, the battle would be won ; were it lost, all vvas lost. On the Highlanders rushed, but under fear ful disadvantages. They had to charge up against a slope ; a wild wind drove a shower of sleet right into their faces; the ranks were ploughed by the w7ell directed fire of their foes. Notwith standing all this, after a sharp but decisive contest, the first line broke. But the Duke had anticipated this, and had Drumossie Moor, where the battle was fought, is simply a plain. Hence it was as favourable as could possibly be to the regular troops, and as unfav ourable to the Highlanders. There was no dash down a hill on troops lost in un familiar scenes : there vvas powerful artillery and determined men to meet. 'They faced their foe, wearied with their fruitless night march to Kilvarock, sick and famished for want of provisions, ill clad, ill-armed, ill-supplied with artillery, shorn of nearly half their strength by recent desertions and by the non-arrval"], [320, "304 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. specially strengthened the second line, and this received the onward coming charge of the foe by a fire poured in at close quarters with deadly effect, and with the point of the bayonet. In vain, with reckless valour, the High landers hurled themselves against the wall of steel. They were re pulsed, and recoiled like the waves from a rock. Then the command vvas given, and the English army in its turn moved forward against the broken foe, who retired in wild disorder, scarcely waiting for the attack. The Mac donalds were stationed on the left wing, to which, according to a tradition of their clan, they had held the right since the battleof Bannockbum. It is said that they stood in sullen silence whilst the clans charged the enemy, and that Keppoch, their chieftain, vvas slain whilst in vain urging them to charge the enemy, and that he fell dying with the passionate words \u2014 \"My God! have the children of my tribe deserted me ? \" and when the battle was really over, they fell back in comparatively good order. Burton, however, considers this accusation un founded. \"The right was nearly de stroyed ere the left had got into motion, and hence, perhaps, came the accusa tion against the Macdonalds, of having stood inactive in their wrath about the question of precedence.\" It is vvell to believe, if we can, that this act of mad folly had not been committed. Highlanders had been their successful charges. He had not believed it possible that they could retreat, and now, in the utmost disorder, they were observed flying in all directions, whilst after them the dragoons rushed in hot pursuit. A wild notion entered into the Prince's mind of placing himself at the head ofthe few who still stood firm, and dying on the field of battle. Perhaps this notion was not so wild as it seemed ; better, at any rate, had it been for his fame, had he consecrated the cause to which he had devoted himself with his dying blood. As after events proved, all that was best in him really died on that fatal day. The selfish voluptuary of later years was not so much a degraded Prince Charles as another and an inferior order of being. Such opportunity for glory, where there vvas none for success, was not to be. Plis attendants, it is said almost using force, hurried him away from that fatal field, on which he had left every earthly hope. Culloden, on thy swarthy brow Spring no wild flowers nor verdure fair ; Thou fecl'st not summer's genial glow, More than the freezing winter air. For once thou drank'st the hero's blood, And war's unhallowed footsteps bore ; Thy deeds unholy Nature viewed, Then fled, and cursed thee evermore. From Beauly's wild and woodland glens, How proudly Lovat's banners soar, How fierce the plaided Highland clans Rush onward with the broad claymore.

It is properly not merely a monument to those who fell there, but to those who were put to death on account of their share in the rising. The govern ment had been thoroughly the eyelid to another, she strove to re frain from the vibration which she believed w'ould occasion the strange and magnificent apparition to vanish.\" But indeed they were only too mortal ! This was Prince Charles and his suite as they fled from Culloden. A hurried interview with Lord Lovat only served to reveal more clearly the utter hopeless ness of the cause, and Charles pushed on to Glengarry. It was deserted and unfurnished, but the Prince was glad to rest on the bare floor, and to dine on the salmon which his attendants managed to catch in the adjacent Loch, and which was reckoned \"very savory and acceptable.\" A few more days of some what circuitous westward travelling brought them to Glenbiosdale, in Arisaig, almost at the very spot where, some months before, the Prince had trodden for the first time the land of his ancestors, with the fond hope that he vvas about to place his father on the throne, and reign beside him as regent, and after him as successor. It vvas here that, with this memento of his past career in his mind, he definitely determined, in the meantime, to cease attempts at further resistance till he could go to France, and obtain help from the government there. He wrote to this effect to his followers, urging them to disband, but promising a speedy return. Indeed. not merely vvas resistance at present hopeless, but Charles could hardly hide himself from his enemies. Gunboats were cruising along the coast, militia were scouring the hills, government spies were spread in all directions over the country, and to stimulate the fidelity of all concerned a reward of \u00a330,000 had been set on the Prince's head. frightened, and their forces had been utterly humiliated. It was not to be wondered at, then, that these last should brutally avenge themselves on com batants and non-combatants, and that the government should take no care to restrain their excesses. Even when the first thirstforvengeancewas slaked, when it was no longer possible to capture and slay men off-hand, the slower process of the law intervened to protract the agony of the unfortunate Jacobites; but it is not in our way to narrate these ; let us rather turn to narrate the last, most romantic and pathetic act of the romantic and pathetic drama of the '45 \u2014 the escape of Prince Charles. At some hours' distance from Inver garry, on the Caledonian Canal, there lies Castle Dounie, the residence of Lord Lovat. The country round is deso late; not even the spring could make it cheerful. One of the girls of the family was gazing, she tells us, with \" indolent composure \" on the scene, when, as if by magic, it became filled with horsemen urging their headlong flight to the castle. So sudden vvas the apparition that the girl actually took them for creatures of her imagination, or even (for she had the ordinary superstition of her time) for fairy folk, and as these, \"according to Highland tradition, are visible to men only from one twinkle of"], [322, "306 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. Amongst a people so poor that this sum represented a mass of money far too great for the imagination fully to com prehend, none w7ere found base enough to betray the trust - reposed in them. It vvas thought better that the Prince should proceed to the Western Isles, for it was believed that he could lie there safe from pursuit till the French vessel appeared that was to take him off; so, on the evening of April 24th, Charles, with a few attendants under the charge of Donald Macleod of Guattergill, set off. It was a very dark night ; but this might not have mattered had it not been that a great storm suddenly burst over the wanderers. The rain beat fiercely on them, the surf broke heavily into the boats, the incessant lightning showed the rock-bound coast, against which the wild waves of the sea were dashing with constantly increasing violence. The Prince proposed a return, but Donald, with alarming frankness, urged on them that it \"vvas as good for them to be drowned in clean water, as to be dashed in pieces upon a rock, and be drowned too!\" Butthe gale somewhat moderated, and the day-dawning discovered them tossing off the island of Benbecula. Here they waited for a few days, till the storm had abated, subsisting in the meanwhile on a cow which they had seized and killed. A few more changes and we find the party on a \"small desert island near the Harris, where, being mistaken for a press-guard, they were avoided by the inhabitants, who deserted the shore at their approach.\" They nourished themselves with dry fish, and something more palatable, for \" as we had plenty of brandy and sugar along with us, and found very good springs upon the island, we wanted much to have a little warm punch, to cheer our hearts in this cold remote place. We luckily found an earthen pitcher, which the fishermen had left upon the island, and this served our purpose very vvell for heating the punch.\" As they again put to sea they were chased by an English man-of-war, but from this the Prince escaped to a wild spot in South Uist, where he lay con cealed a whole month. Every pre caution vvas taken for his safety. A cordon of scouts surrounded the place of his retreat. Guides were perpetually in attendance to show him paths by which in case of alarm he might escape. A boat was kept in constant readiness to depart. The government always seemed to have known whereabouts the Prince was, but never the exact spot. However, they began to get dangerously near the place of his retreat, and it was deemed ad visable that he should again shift. One Hugh Macdonald of Baleshair vvas sent to advise with him, and he has left us a very minute account of the interview.. Of the Prince he says: \u2014 \"His dress vvas then a tartan short coat, and vest of the same, got from Lady Clanronald ; his night-cap all patched with soot drops ; his shirt, hands, and face all patched with the same; a short kilt, tartan hose, and Highland brogs, his upper coat being English cloth.\" The food vvas of the simplest description, and. served with anything but neatness. \"He called for a dram, being the first article of a Highland entertainment, which, being over, he called for meat. There was about a half stone of butter laid on a timber plate, and near a leg of beef laid on a chest before us, all patched with soot-drops, notwithstand ing it being washed toties quoties.\" They transacted their business, and then were about to depart, but the Prince would by no means hear of this. For once he would drown his cares, and so we have a description of a regular Highland debauch, quite in the manner of the \"good old times.\" \"Then we began* with our bowls, frank and free. As we were turning merry we were turning more free,\" and then there follows a series of questions of a rather searching nature, which the Prince answered satis factorily. His friends a ere rather alraid"], [323, "THE WANDERLNGS OF PRINCE CHARLES. 307 that when \" he had his own again,\" he would forget them ; \" but he told us then, if he had never so much ado, he would be one night merry with his Highland friends.\" The narrator adds, with conscious pride, \"We continued this drinking for three days and three nights,\" and then confesses admiringly : \"He had still the better of us, and even of Boisdale himself, notwithstanding his being as ableabowlsman, I dare say, as any in Scotland.\" Then, on the evening ofthe 14th June, off they set again, and for some time led a wandering life amidst the islands, which were not in fested with scouts of the opposite party, whilst a large number of men-of-war were cruising about the narrow straits between the islands. Sometimes Charles had to sleep in a cranny of the bare rock, and he who was accustomed to the splendour of Rome and the luxury of Paris now thought himself exceptionally fortunate if he could obtain the shelter of a roof, however mean and humble. At last they were obliged again to re turn to South Uist, which they did after narrowly escaping from an English cruiser. Here it was determined that Charles, accompanied by one servant, should again attempt to escape, and after a \" woeful parting indeed,\" he set off. there who wished to see her, and \" she, with some emotion, asked me if it was the Prince.\" She vvas told it was, and then he came in. They conversed as to the most advisable plan. It seemed best to go to Skye, but there vvas a difficulty in the way. \"She answered with the greatest respect and loyalty, but declined it, saying Sir Alexander Macdonald vvas too much her friend for her to be the instrument of his ruin.\" She vvas in formed that he vvas absent, and so at last was persuaded. Soon the details were settled ; the Prince was to dress as a woman, and to pass off as Betty Burke, maid to Miss Macdonald. It vvas deter mined that on the following day Charles should go from South Uist. But when going to Ormaclode, Miss Macdonald vvas made a prisoner! The militia had strict orders to bring all passers-by before the commanding officer, who, however, vvas her step-father, and he soon gave orders for his daughter's release. He also furnished her, \" Betty Burke,\" and a man named Neil Mak echan, with passports. And now they were to meet at Rosshineis, but how were they to get there ? The militia watched all the ways, and therefore the sea route was the only one open. After considerable delay a small skiff was procured, and this took them a good part of the way; as for the rest, they walked, and a wild moor had to be tramped under a blinding shower of sleet. They got a little refreshment in a shepherd's hut, and about ten reached their destination \u2014 only to learn that a large body of Skye militia were posted in the neighbourhood. The Prince vvas obliged to leave the hut, foi the militia came there for milk. He spent the time crouched under a rock. Makechan tells the story : \u2014 \" It is almost inexpressible what torment the Prince suffered under that unhappy rock, which had neither height nor breadth to cover him from the rain, which poured down on him so thick as if all the windows of It is now that we come to the episode which is the most touching in these wan derings. Flora Macdonald vvas the step daughterofHugh Macdonald of Armadale in Skye. He held a commission in the Hanoverian army, but vvas in secret a Jacobite. It seems to have been thought that Flora might be extremely service able in assisting the Prince to escape. That she had prudence, decision, and energy of character, subsequent events abundantly proved. The Prince had gone to Benbecula, and there the first interview took place. Flora vvas stay ing in a small hut, and O'Neal, the Prince's only companion, went to visit her there. O'Neal said a friend vvas"], [324, "308 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. think I never,\" said a servant who accompanied the party, which soon afterwards set out, \" saw such an im pudent-looking woman as Kingsburgh is walking with. I dare say she is either an Irishwoman, or a man in woman's clothes. See what long strides the jade takes, and how awkwardly she manages her petticoats.\" The heir of a hundred kings hardly indeed could be expected to look the character of an Irish waiting maid. \" They call you a pretender,\" said Kingsburgh, half in apprehension, half in compliment; \"all I can say is, that you are the worst at your trade that I ever saw.\" At Kingsburgh's house the little child rushed to inform her mother that there had arrived \"the most odd, muckle, ill-shaken-up wife she had ever seen.\" Kingsburgh's wife vvas astonished when this strange figure bent down and kissed her. She saw it vvas a man ! and asked her husband in a whisper if he were one of \" the un fortunate gentlemen escaped from Cul loden ? \" Heaven had broken open ; and to com plete his tortures, there lay such a swarm of midges upon his face and hands as would have made any other but himself fall into despair, which, not withstanding his incomparable patience, made him utter such hideous cries and complaints as would have rent the rocks with compassion.\" For three days he hung about the hut, and at last Miss Macdonald, with Lady Clanronald, vvas able to join them. They all sat down to dinner, and as things seemed clearing a little, were cheerful and happy ; but the party vvas broken up in haste by the news that Lady Clanronald's house vvas full of soldiers. So the merrymaking came to an abrupt termination. On the evening of June 2Sth they sailed for Skye. The night was dark, but calm, when they started, but in a little a very high wind sprang up, and the rowers thought there was real danger of the boat being swamped. Day-break showed the coast of Skye unexpectedly near. A militia station occupied the first landing-place, and they were signalled to land or be shot. Charles ordered the boatmen not to fear the villains, and they said \" that they had no fear for themselves, but only for him.\" They were within the range of the shot, but escaped unhurt. At last they got ashore at Kilbride, but Morgstat, the seat of Sir Alexander Mac donald, was occupied by soldiers, and Lady Macdonald, in an agony of terror, insisted on the Prince's immediate re moval. In this extremity the factor Mac donald of Kingsburgh came forward and offered to assist in conveying the Prince to Portree, from whence it was intended to go to Rasay. Kingsburgh and the Prince met on the shore. The Prince vvas attired in a \" flowered linen gown, a light-coloured quilted petticoat, a white apron, and a mantle of dun camlet, made after the Irish fashion with a hood ; \" in his hand he had a huge cudgel, which he brandished in a vigorous manner. '\u2022 I \" Yes,\" was the reply. \" What of the Prince ? \" \" He is the Prince.\" \"Then weare ruined ! \" said the poor woman solemnly. Her husband com forted her with the somewhat trite reflection that they could die but once, and told her to prepare the meal. With comical female inconsistency she who a minute before was anxious for her life, now transferred all her anxiety to her larder. She had only bread and cheese, eggs and butter, and she wrung her hands with anguish as she reflected on what must pass in the Prince's mind as he viewed the humble board. Her husband told her something of \"how he had fared of late,\" and so the supper was spread. The next morning they must again away.

As Flora adjusted the cap, her companion asked her to beg from the Prince a lock of his hair ; but Miss Macdonald's simple and high-minded nature shrank from the task. She declined. The Prince asked what vvas the matter? On being told, he smiled, laid his head in Flora's lap, and told her to take as much as she wanted. They, however, did not want other Jaco bite relics. Kingsburgh gave thePrince a new pair of shoes, and religiously kept the worn ones as relics. These were cut into small pieces and distributed to friends. \" The Jacobite ladies,\" we ;:re told, \" often took away the pieces they got in their bosoms.\" Another relic of a sterner character vvas kept \u2014 the sheets of the bed where he slept were preserved with pious care by the two ladies, and they served them as shrouds \u2014 pathetic memoirs of a devotion lhat vvas sweeter than life and stronger than death. time as a man-servant, though this dis guise vvas not much more successful than the last. \"There is not a person,\" said one of them, \"who knows what the air of a noble or great man is, but, upon seeing the Prince in any disguise he could put on, would see something that was not ordinary\u2014 something of the stately and grand in him.\" After some more weary wanderings, during which no French ship came in sight, we find Charles again on the mainland, on the shores of Loch Nevis. He then went to Borraidale, where Angus Mac donald and his family, who had lost all for his sake, were staying in a small hut. A son of Macdonald's had fallen at Cullo den, and this thought was present in the Prince's mind as he looked round the wretched dwelling, and bowed to the dead lad's mother. He asked her gravely \" if she could bear the sight of one who had been the cause of so much misery to her and her family.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \" even though all my sons had fallen in your Royal Highncss's service.\" The district vvas here beset with soldiers. A cordon was drawn round every place where it was expected the Prince might be hiding, and the whole country thoroughly examined. But a guide, who knew the ways far better than the English soldiers, was easily procured, and after three days of intense toil the braes of Glenmoriston were reached, \"where, without food or fire, and wet to the skin, his only shelter vvas a small cave, the limits of which were so narrow, and the narrow floor so rugged, as almost to rob him even of the luxury or sleep.\" But now Charles again changed his clothes fora man's dress, and proceeded to the shore at a distance of half-a-mile from Portree. Here he bade farewell to Flora Macdonald. Pie spoke no word of thanks, but took her hand and pressed it convulsively. He gazed down for a moment on the fair young face, and the eyes dimmed with tears, but bright with the expression of the pro found fidelity of her race. Then he reverently bared his head, and bending down kissed her twice on the forehead. As he stepped into the boat he turned and looked back. \"For all that has happened, I hope, Madam, we shall meet in St. James's yet.\" The boat vvas soon lost in the distance. The two were never again to look on each other in this world. The country was then ini'ested by a band of wild caterans, called the Seven Men of Glenmoriston. They had been concerned in the rising, had been hunted out of house and home, and were now revenging themselves by plundering* and killing any member of the other side on whom they could lay hands. They had been declared outlaws, and a The party got to Rasay safely enough, and after that to Skye.

They readily undertook the dangerous task of defending one whom they believed to be their rightful leader. So far from con sidering the task a dangerous one, they wrere proud of their Prince, and im plored him, with rough vehemence and quaint arguments, for ever to remain with them. \" Stay with us,\" they said, \"stay with us; the mountain of goldwhich the government have set upon your head may induce some gentleman to betray you, for he can go to a distant country, and live on the price of his dishonour \u2014 but to us there exists no such temptation. We can speak no language but our own ; we can live no where but in this country. Were we to injure a hair of your head, the very mountains would fall down to crush us to death.\" But ambition was not yet dead in Charles. He hoped still to live in Britain, not as a skulking fugitive, but honoured at the Court of St. James's. He stayed with these men for almost a month. Wild as vvas his abode, this was not the most disagreeable part of his travels. He at least had rest and safety, for the devoted fidelity of those around him, and the inaccessible situa tion of the retreat, seemed to preclude the possibility of surprise and capture. The Seven Men scoured the country far and wide in search of provisions, of which he had always an abundant supply, and sometimes even dainties were obtained; his guardians often risked their very lives to procure him something which they believed he might care far. But he again was obliged to press on. With Lochiel. Cluny, Macpherson, and one or two others as staunch and devoted, he lay for some time in the heart of that wild region that had once been the home of the Wolf of Badenock. \" We lived,\" says one of the party, \"in a very romantic and comical habitation, called the cage, which was only large enough to contain six or seven persons, four ot which number were frequently employed in playing at cards, one idle looking on, one baking, and another firing bread and cooking.\" Here a message reached them with the welcome intelligence that two French ships had been sent to carry them away, and that these were now lying in Loch- nanuagh. They hastened to the shore. A boat vvas sent for them, and the Prince stepped on board \" French territory,\" though but a plank, and felt himself at length safe from his foes. He em- barked almost at the very place where, fourteen months before, he had landed to begin that series of adventures surpass- ing anything to be found in romance, which are comprehended under the title of \"The Jacobite Rising of 1745.\" By a strange fatality, it vvas his lot to visit as a fugitive almost every place in the Highlands which he had visited as a young hero, come, as he himself said, to regain the throne of his ancestors or perish in the attempt. He had done neither, and some thought of this may perhaps have crossed his mind as the shores of Scotland faded from his view. He was never destined to see them again. Yet our guesses at what he thought and felt are in reality conditioned by our knowledge of subse- quent events. If we carefully examine the records of his sayings and actions, we can easily infer that the true state of the case vvas somewhat as follows : \u2014 He was in the first place so utterly wearied with his wanderings physically, and the effect of the constant hunt of which he was the object had such a depressing effect upon him mentally, that he must have been profoundly relieved when he felt himself safe, and probably had far keener sensations of pleasure when he left the country than when he entered it. The physical, though less important than the mental, has yet its place before it. Till that Le satisfied, there is with most people little room for anything else. This is the explanation of the rebounds"], [327, "THE WANDERINGS OF PRINCE CHARLES. 311 of hilarious gaiety which this young hero exhibited when he had the prospect of a good meal, with the usual accessories of a Highland festival. Then it must also be remembered that he did not leave without hope. His constant reference to a future residence at \"the Court of St. James's,\" where he lovedtopicturehimself as dispensing favours and recompenses to those who had stood by him in the day of trial; his often expressed determination to return at the head of a French force, which he evidently thought would at once be placed at his disposal, alike show this. A little reflection on this re markable, and, for the student, by no means uninteresting phase of human nature, will show us that such were his views. Of course, with his adherents it vvas different ; the very success of the en terprise atthe first only showed them more clearly how utterly impossible success was. One defeat completely shattered the whole organisation \u2014 already crum bling away of itself after its marvellous successes. They could not but feel that even had Culloden gone differently, this would only have deferred for a little the inevitable end. So there were no more real attempts to reinstate the old line. Jacobitism henceforth passed out of the regionof actual fact intothatof poetry and romance. There was a dramatic fitness that its last representative should pass from the scene where and how he did. Still, many traces of nobleness were in him, and these were fixed by the force of events in the national imagination. He is still splendid when he leaves the stage. for not being in advance of the times in which he lived. It has always been the unhappy privilege of kings, save in the few cases where the theory of a con stitutional monarchy as we know it has been developed, to involve in their own lot that of others. His will is not his own, For he himself is subject to his birth : He may not, as unvalu'd persons do, Care for himself ; for on his choice depends The safety and the health of the whole state. Yet, by every principle of justice, if we were to give him the blame for all the misfortunes of the '45, a previous question might be raised \u2014 Was the '45 an unmixed evil ? Was it not rather a great good ? It did on a smaller scale what the great French Revolution did on a larger \u2014 it cleared away the \"rubbish of centuries.\" The feudal jurisdiction of the chiefs was abolished; the High lands were opened ; peace was secured to the Lowlands, and from the events of that memorable time dates the pros perity which Scotland now enjoys. This article has already reached to a very considerable length, and yet we can not close it without some words as to the Flora Macdonald episode. It was natural that a certain amount of myth should grow up about this romantic incident. A story of a hopeless passion was fabricated. It vvas said thatthePrince haddancedwith her atHolyrood, andthat she vvas so captivated that she was ready ever after to risk her life for him. Then such a subject became a favourite theme for Jacobite songs, of which the not unpleasing \"Flora Macdonald's Lament\" may be taken as an example. Such a story robs the incident of all its high character, and one is glad to learn that it is absolutely wdthout foundation. She vvas animated by no other feeling than heroic devotion, and he, by the chivalrous respect which he invariably exhibited to her, shows himself to have been quite aware of this.

We were told that it is in some places 140 fathoms deep, a profundity scarcely credible, and which probably those that relate it have never sounded.\" Dr. Johnson's scepticism has been justified, for the greatest depth is about 129 fathoms. \" Going along,\" continues the narrator, \" we espied a cottage.\" This cottage they entered, and Dr. Johnson, with true courtesy, explains how it is not consi dered impolite in the Highlands to do so. This is his description of the hut. It has always seemed to us a literary tit-bit : \u2014 \"A hut is constructed with loose stones, ranged for the most part with some ten dency to circularity. It must be placed where the wind cannot act upon it with violence, because it has no cement, and where the water will run easily away, because it has no floor but the naked ground. The wall, which is commonly about six feet high, declines from the recalls to most of us apiece of water, unpleasant to the eye, and still more so to the smell, which stretches through some tract of flat, hideous coal country. On its banks rise factories dominated by huge chimneys continually belching forth dense clouds of smoke. Along it creep vessels ungainly in shape, loaded with cargoes, useful it may be, but certainly unpleasant. A canal, in short, is something eminently practical, utilitarian, ugly. If it were possible that any one should carry those ideas with him to the Highlands, and imagine that the Caledonian Canal was as other canals, how agreeably would he be disappointed ! For the sail from Inverness to Fort William is through a varied panorama of the most charming scenery in all fair Scotland. Through that fair scenery it is our pleasing duty now to conduct the reader, only pre mising that the so-called canal is in reality a chain of lochs, which are all joined together by cuttings. The first of tnese is Loch Ness, or the Lake of the Cataract. It is over twenty miles in length, and about a mile broad. But here is Dr. Johnson's account of it from the celebrated \"Journey to the Western Islands,\" a book whose ponderous style has a certain quaint charm: \u2014 \"On the left were high and steepy rocks, shaded with birch, the hardy native of the North, and covered with fern or heather. On the right the limpid waters of Lough Ness were beating their banks, and waving their surface by a gentle agitation."], [330, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 314 with such colour as no palace in all England reveals. And, as if it were especially intended by Nature that full justice should be done to her fair colour ing by the most desirable foil and contrast, she has given the Highlanders peat, which they build into stacks close to their habitations, and whose intense depth of mingled purples and browns, make their walls gleam like jewellery. And when some cottage in the clachan lies empty and deserted, and the wood work of the roof rises, a grim skeleton, above the abandoned walls, blacker than black, yet full of deep purples in its blackness, arrangements of colour be come possible to the painter, such as the strongest colourists desire. perpendicular a little inward. Such rafters as can be procured are then raised for a roof, and covered with heath, which makes a strong and warm thatch, kept from flying off by ropes of twisted heath, of which the ends, reaching from the centre of the thatch to the top of the wall, are held firm by the weight of a large stone. No light is admitted but at the entrance, and through a hole in the thatch which gives vent to the smoke. This hole is not directly over the fire, lest the rain should extinguish it; and the smoke, therefore, naturally fills the place before it escapes.\" In contrast, let us place beside it this charming description of the huts of a clachan, given by Mr. Hamerton in his \"Painter's Camp in the Highlands\" : \u2014 And all the adjuncts are so perfect! The landscape about a clachan is nearly always lovely. There is sure to be a grey precipice or purple hill within sight, or a rocky stream, or, at any rate, a picturesque group of trees. Then the people who live in it are so picturesque. I have never in my life seen finer figure subjects than some noble groups of strong, hardy children, playing about the doors of the huts, and clad in all manner of admirable rags. And the very cows are clothed in lovelier fur than any other cows. Nothing in animal life is grander than a little Highland bull, black as coal and majestic as a king, marching heavily, with a strong sense of his own personal dignity and might. No wonder Rosa Bonheur likes the Highland cattle. It is enough to drive a painter half crazy with delight to see the sunshine on their fur! Tnen what variety of colour there is in them ' You have them of all colours \u2014 black, cream, tawny, red, and brown, grouping with each other exactly as if they were artistic cows, comprising grand living pictures for our especial pleasure. \"A genuine Highland clachan is one of the most picturesque things in the world, especially just after rain, when the colour comes out. The houses, as everybody knows, of one story only, are built of great rough stones, and thatched in a rude way with rushes. Considered as artificial things, they do no honour to their artificers, for all their beauty is due to Nature, and to the poverty of the builders, who were not rich enough to contend with Nature. Whenever High landers are well off, they cease to build picturesquely altogether, the inns and farmhouses and kirks being uniformly square and hideous, whilst the castles of the nobility are usually \u2014 if of recent date \u2014 devoid of all interest except as endur ing examples of the lowest bathos of the 'Gothic' renaissance. If the Highlanders could build churches and castles as grandly as they build poor men's huts, their country would be as great in archi tecture as it is in scenery. '' The poor men's huts have the sub limity of rocks and hillocks. The colouring of the walls is so exquisite that it would take a noble colourist to imitate it at all. Gold of lichen, rose of granite, green of moss, make the rude stone of the poor man's house glorious Nor is any painter likely to forget the sheep, with their twisted horns, that the travelling tinker will make spoons of some day for the cottagers' wives.

These things shall you see about the cottages of our poor peasantry, there; and commonly, also, a little field of corn, all green and gold in its partial ripening, and laid, perhaps, by thought less gales. There will be a little kail yard, too \u2014 that is, a miniature garden for cabbages \u2014 and a plot for potatoes. And out of these little huts there come as fine women as eyes can behold. Mighty and robust is the typical High land beauty. Her eyes are brown as the pool of a stream in the heather; her cheeks are full and florid as red apples ; her hair is of deepest brown and black. Strong arms has she for labour, and stout legs for travel. Her structure is more for use than grace : her feet are large, her ankles thick, yet she is a glorious creature.\" Well, this is rather a long quotation, but the remarks are so good that we could not shorten it. Let us return now to the Doctor and \" Bozzy.\" Among the heathy hills and ragged woods The roaring l'yers pours his mossy floods ; Till full he dashes on the rocky mounds, Here is the account of the \" Fall of Fiers,\" or Foyers, as it is now called, situated about the middle of the south side of the loch. \"Towards evening we crossed, by a bridge, the river which makes the celebrated Fall of Fiers. The country at the bridge strikes the imagi nation with all the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude. The way makes a flexure, and the mountains, covered with trees, rise at once on the left hand and in the front. We desired our guides to show us the Fall, and, dismounting, clambered over very rugged crags, till I began to wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with less trouble and danger. We came at last to a place where we could overlook the river, and saw a channel, torn, as it seems, through black piles of stone, by which the stream is obstructed and broken till it comes to Where, thro' a shapeless breach, his stream re- sounds.

We do not know what motto the new building has, but a not inappropriate one would surely be, Arma ccdunt togae \u2014 at least this admirably ex presses the remarkable change. Of the Lovat family, certainly the most remark able vvas Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, who first appears on the stage of Scottish politics about the end of the seventeenth century, when he had succeeded in ousting the heiress of the late Lord Lovat, and claimed the property and leadership ofthe clan for himself and his father. During the whole course of his life he acted a double part, and especially in the '15 and '45 constantly intrigued with the two sides. The early successes of CharlesEdward induced him to become a little less cautious. He definitely com mitted himself to the Jacobite cause. The government were fully aware of the treacherous part that he had acted, and he, of all men, vvas least likely to escape. The last scenes of the life of this ex traordinary man are thus narrated by Scott with his accustomed power, and we give the quotation, although a some what lengthy one, as an example, not merely of his fate, but of that of many other noblemen, as unfortunate, though less deserving of such a cruel doom: \u2014 the neighbourhood. The glen on itG east side is Glen Urquhart, through which the Enneric water runs out into Urquhart Bay. On the west of this bay, a narrow peninsula runs out into the loch, and at the extremity of this the gloomy ruin of Castle Urquhart rises sheer out of the water, which is here at its deepest. Although it might have been supposed that the remoteness of this castle would have preserved it from invaders, yet this is not the case. In 1303 it vvas taken by the officers of Edward I., who barbarously put the garrison to the sword. In 1334 it was held by the patriotic party against the adherents of Baliol. It vvas a royal castle, and though frequently \"disponed\" by our monarchs, seemed always to get back into their hands; but it passed finally from the royal possession in 15C9, when James IV. \" granted three charters ofthe lordship\" to theGrants of Freuchie. Fort Augustus, which may serve to remind us of the suppressal of the Jacobite risings, is at the end of Loch Ness. The town is quite modern, and is a late instance of that process which we have already noted in con nection with Stirling, Edinburgh, and Dumbarton \u2014 namely, the rise of a town round a military position. The fort itself has had a strange history. It vvas built shortly after the '15, \"in the form of a quadrangle, with four bastions at the corner.\" Quieter times succeeded. The Highlands became the most con tented and orderly part ofthe sovereign's dominions, and the fort vvas no longer of any use. It was determined to sell it. The purchaser was the representative of a family against which it might be sup posed to have been specially directed, and this bulwark of the Revolution set tlement, and the Protestant ascendancy, became a Roman Catholic College, of which the guide-books say: \" It is con ducted by the fathers of the English Benedictines congregation, and has been designed with a view to give to the \"The conclusion of Lord Lovat'sevent ful and mysterious career was the next important act of this eventful tragedy.

The old man was brought to the Tower of Lon don. On this occasion, using the words of the Latin poet, he expressed himself prepared either to resort to his old stra tagems, or to meet death like a man, if he should find it inevitable. Lovat's trial, which came on before the House of Lords on the 9th, and was finished on the 19th day of March, was very long and extremely curious. On the former occasions it had not been necessary to produce the evidence of Secretary Mur ray ; but on the present, as Lovat had not been personally engaged in the insur rection, it vvas indispensable to prove his accession to the previous conspiracy. This vvas accomplished in the fullest manner; indeed, he said of himself, pro- bably with great truth, that he had been engaged in every insurrection in favour of the family of James the Seventh, since he vvas fifteen years old; and he might have added, he had betrayed some of them to the opposite party. His guilt, thinly covered by a long train of fraud, evasion, and deceit, was clearly mani- fested, though he displayed very con- siderable skill and legal knowledge in his defence. Being found guilty by the House of Lords, the sentence of high treason vvas pronounced upon the old man in the usual horrible terms. He heard it with indifference, and replied, ' I bid your lordships an everlasting farewell! Sure I am, we shall never all meet again in the same place.' land, pleading his high favour with George the First, and how he had carried his royal highness about when a child, in the parks of Kensington and Hamp ton-Court. Finding these meannesses were in vain, he resolved to imitate in his death the animal he most resembled in his life, and die like the Fox, without indulging his enemies by the utterance of a sigh or groan. It is remarkable how the audacity of this daring man rendered him an object of wonder and awe at his death, although the whole course of his life had been spent in a manner calculated to excite very different feelings. Lovat had also, indeed, the advantage of the compassion due to extreme old age, still nourishing a daunt less spirit, even when a life beyond the usual date of humanity vvas about to be cut short by a public execution. Many circumstances are told of him in prison, from which we may infer that the care less spirit of levity vvas indulged by him to the last moment. On the evening before his execution, his warder ex pressed himself sorry that the morrow should be such a bad day with his Lord ship. ' Bad ! ' replied his Lordship ; ' for what ? do you think I am afraid of an axe? It is a debt we must all pay, and better in this way than by a linger ing disease.' When ascending the scaffold (in which he requested the assistance of two warders), he looked round on the multi tude, and seeing so many people, said with a sneer, ' God save us, why should there be such a bustle about taking off an old grey head from a man who can not get up three steps without two assis tants ? ' On the scaffold he repeated the line of Horace \u2014 During the interval between the sen tence and its execution, this singular personage employed himself at first in solicitations for life, expressed pretty much in the style of a fawning letter, which, when he was first taken prisoner, he had written to the Duke of Cumber- ' Duke et decorum est pro patria mori.'

He had entered into the scheme against his better judgment, and had gone to Borro- dale to persuade Charles to give up the enterprise, as he was absolutely certain that it could only end in disastrous failure. Charles, however, determined to go on. \" In a few days,\" he said, \" with the few friends that I have, I will erect the royal standard, and proclaim to the people of Britain that Charles Stewart is come over to claim the crown of his ancestors, to win it, or to perish in the attempt. Locheil, who, my father has often told me, was our firmest friend, may stay at home, and learn from the newspapers the fate of his prince.\" Stung to the quick, the Highland chief passionately replied, \" No, I will share the fate of my prince, and so shall every man over whom nature or fortune hath given me any power.\" This pathetic interview finally decided the fate of the movement ; and from then the prepara- tions went on which got ready the way forthe erection of the standard at Glen finnan. The next loch on the line of route is that of Oich, the smallest of those in the chain. We can only here notice the mountain of Craig-an-phitich, or Rock of the Raven, which name the Macdonalds used as a war-cry. Loch Lochy comes next, and to the north of this, in a narrow valley, is Loch Arkaig. This wild region is consecrated to the memory of Locheil.

Jnverlochy Castle \u2014 A Gaelic Poet Laureate, N English poet, whose genius led him to prefer, as a rule, softer scenes, and the beauties of human art rather than of nature, has given us a few lines on the Prince of Scottish mountains, which are well worth quoting: \u2014 the mountain. It has been riven again and again by some terrific convulsion of nature in long-past ages. Snow is fre quently to be met with in some of the more shady fissures, and the wild scream of the eagle, reverberating from the most lofty crags, is the fit accompaniment to the awful solitude. Traces of silver and lead have been found in the moun tain, whose composition is thus of an altogether mixed and curious character. Round the foot winds the Nevis glen, and through it runs, with headlong speed, the Nevis river. This rises in the mountain, is less than ten miles long, and falls into Locheil, after making some charming waterfalls. Not very far from where this river falls into the Loch, is Inverlochy Castle. It vvas here that a remarkable battle took place between the adherents of Campbell and Mon trose \u2014 families that represented for long the two antagonistic principles in Scottish life and politics. This vvas in 1645, and Argyll's men marched to the neighbourhood under the leadership of the Marquis, and there behaved in such a manner that they roused the anger of Ian Lom, commonly called in English John Macdonald, a famous Gaelic poet, who forthwith proceeded to Montrose, then lying with his army near the place. Montrose listened with chilling indiffer ence to the passionate tale of the poet, but all his followers were not so patient. One of them, Macdonald, the son of Colkitto, said he \"would go and see what vvas wrong in Mac donald's country.\" They set off, and ad vanced far into \"Macdonald's country,\" without seeing anything very amiss. Colkitto thought he had been deceived, and as placidity of temper was not his Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist !

Whether these somewhat pagan reflections of poor Keats will occur to the wanderer's mind or not, he will, if he has any sense of the sublime, be powerfully affected by this, the highest, and, in many respects, the most remark able mountain in the British Islands. On the rare occasion when the top is free from clouds, a magnificent view can be obtained of a very large part of the North of Scotland from sea to sea. The ascent is troublesome, for not merely does the brown porphyry and red granite of which it is composed curl itself into the most steep and awkward masses, but great detours have to be made to get round all sorts of obstinate precipices, insurmountable crags, and so on.

Ian Lorn vvas devo tedly attached to the cause of the Stewarts, and he wrote countless Jaco bite lays, and did much to keep alive the Jacobite sentiment in that part of Scot land. This region vvas, indeed, named, in the '45, the \"cradle of the rebellion,\" for the whole minds of the people were so saturated with songs and sentiments of this kind, that they rose up as one man to do battle for the House of Stew art; but the Jacobite cause vvas always favoured by the Muses, if not by the Fates. It never wanted singers to cele brate its few successes and bewail its many defeats, and to throw over a lost cause The poet's credibility was thus assured, and he vvas placed in the position of leader of the party. He conducted them round the base of Ben Nevis during the night, and in the morning they fell upon the surprised Campbells, who, never dreaming an enemy was near, were living in careless security. At the first alarm of battle, the Marquis got himself safely stowed away in a galley on the loch, and this added to the dismay of his unfortunate followers, who fled almost without making any effort at resistance, and were butchered like sheep by their savage opponents. The poet, from a safe eminence, watched the combat with vengeful glee. He com posed a song to celebrate the event, and in this \" he luxuriates like a fiend on the anticipated music of the widows and orphans of the Campbells in Argyleshire weeping and clapping their hands in agony over the fate of their husbands and fathers.\" Ian Lorn held the post of poet laureate in Gaelic to Charles II., and with him died that strange office. He was at the battle of Killiecrankie, at least so he assures us in the spirit stirring strain with which he celebrated that famous victory \u2014 strains which, even in a translation, have something of the wild force of the Highland charge they commemorate. He lived to a green old age, and oneof his last poetical efforts was a song in which he bitterly inveighed against that accursed union of 1705, The poet's consecration and the dream, The light that never was on sea or shore.

At this battle Montrose vvas sadly de feated, and escaped to the North by swimming the Kyle, leaving behind him his standard, his cloak, his star, and the garter with which Charles had lately invested him. Having already been condemned to death by the Parliament, he was treated on his way to Edinburgh as a convicted criminal. He was brought into the capital on the 18th May, in the afternoon, and carried through the streets bareheaded in a cart driven by the hangman in his livery, the other prisoners walking two and two before him.

There is nothing remarkable in either As we have been called upon to say a good many things about the Highlands. we think this a favourable opportunity for giving some little account ofthe clan system, and one or two points connected with it. A clan was an association of men bound together by ties of consanguinity. custom, common interest, and common"], [344, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 324 possession, who, under a chief, occupied a piece of ground, as, for instance, the Grants did that part of Strathspey about Craig Elachie. This piece of ground was generally held to belong to the whole clan. It vvas by no means the exclusive possession of the chief, who was obliged to consult the elders of the tribe before he took any important step regarding it, or, indeed, any other of the clan's affairs. Not indeed that all these relations and rights were defined by law, or even with any approach to legal precision. But the force of long custom had made it an unwritten law that such things were to be, and so they continued for long ages. It was almost a necessary consequence of such an or ganisation in a rude age that it should be warlike, and indeed war was consi dered the only proper occupation of a gentleman. \"The military ranks ofthe clan,\" says Dr. Maclachlan, \" were fixed and perpetual. The chief was, of course, the principal commander. The oldest cadet commanded the right wing, and the youngest the rear. Every head ofa distinct family vvas captain of his own tribe. An ensign or standard-bearer was attached to each clan, who gene rally inherited his office, which had been usually conferred on an ancestor who had distinguished himself.\" Each clan had a place of meeting and a rallying cry. The men were summoned on any striking emergency by the well-known symbol of the fiery cross \u2014 two pieces of wood joined together in the form of a cross, of which one end had been burnt, and the other was stained with blood. Various messengers were sent on with these. Each ran at full speed till he vvas becoming exhausted, when he passed on the symbol to the first of his tribe he met, and it vvas the duty of the man thus charged with the mission to be diverted from fulfilling it by no other duty, how ever solemn and important. . It will be remembered that, in the \" Lady of the Lake,\" the solemn task of carrying the message tears one man away from the arms of his bride, and prevents another from laying- his father in the grave. As far as can be known, the last time this symbol vvas carried was in 1745, when it was sent round Loch Tay by the Earl of Breadal bane in order to collect his people to make a stand against the Jacobites. The distance of thirty-three miles is said to have been accomplished in three hours; but this is probably an exaggera tion. At any rate, it vvas a curious example of the \" irony of fate \" that this ancient Highland ceremony should be employed for the last time against that very cause with which the Highlanders are usually considered as identified. An imaginative, melancholy people like the Highlanders were naturally very superstitious, and when \" on the war path\" they were encouraged or deterred by all sorts of singular omens. Among the most remarkable was this: that if a \"woman barefooted crossed the road before them, they seized her and drew blood from her forehead.\" In such a state of society disputes lead ing to war would be of frequent occur rence. The various territories between two clans could never be quite accurately defined; among a passionate, high-spiri ted people, quarrels on this or some other ground would speedily and easily arise, and these were likely to end in battle; it was deemed necessary to avenge the deaths in such battles, and so a feud, handed down from father to son for many generations, was the result. There were various ways in which one tribe might be easily avenged on another. Cattle lifting vvas a very common and profitable means of reprisal. The Lowlanders, or \" Sassenachs,\" were considered as a common foe by all the Highlanders, and without in the least imagining that there was anything wrong in it, they levied forced contribu tions of cattle, etc., from them whenever it suited their purpose, or made them"], [345, "\"STAND FAST, CRAIG ELACHIE!\" 325 pay blackmail for that protection which they, and not the law, were able to afford. It must not be supposed that the Highlanders were a set of thieves \u2014 not one whit more than the English officer of the present day, who, in time of war, seizes upon the stores of the enemy. No such things as bolts, or locks, or bars were used for the houses. They w7ere not needed, for robbery was a thing unknown. It would even seem that not only did they not consider them selves as robbers, but they were not considered so by other people. General Wade, in October, 1729, visited a party of these cearnachs, or \" highwaymen,\" as he somewhat inappropriately calls them, and in a letter to Forbes of Cullo den, he thus describes the interview : \u2014 \u25a0 \"The knight and I travelled in my carriage with great ease and pleasure to the feast of oxen which the highwaymen had prepared for us opposite Lochgarry, where we found four oxen roasting at the same time, in great order and solemnity. We dined in a tent pitched for that purpose. The beef vvas excellent, and we had plenty of bumpers, not forgetting your lordship and Culloden's health ; and after three hours' stay, took leave of our benefactors, the highwaymen, and arrived at the hut at Dalnachardach before it was dark.\" ing military service to him. Such of the Highland chiefs as saw which way things were tending in Scotland, and where the ruling power would ultimately lie, were wise enough to obtain grants of this land from the crown. .. It is to this connection with the court that the great powers of the Campbells, both of Argyle and Breadalbane, is to be ascribed; but some chiefs were too careless to do this, or their possessions lay near to some powerful neighbour, who looked upon them with an envious eye. It was easy to bring forward some offence, real or alleged, which the hostile chief was said to have committed, and then he was charged with this, and his lands forfeited. The execution of the sentence was com mitted to his powerful neighbour, who, furnished with letters of fire and sword, at once set to work to make an end of this unlucky clan. Very soon they were driven to the most inaccessible parts of the mountains, and all that they could do by way of support and revenge, was to pursue a course of depredation against the property of those that had crushed them. The case of the Macgregors vvas a remarkable instance of this, as we have already noticed when speaking of Rob Roy. The chiefs that were more fortu nate became exceedingly powerful, and in time might almost be considered as absolute rulers ofthe tribe. They had the \" power of pit and gallows,\" which they, and the officials to whom their au thority was delegated, were by no means slow to exercise. An incident so late as 1707 is a proof of this. LordDrummond had an executioner famed far and near for the ability with which he performed the duties of his ghastly office. The town of Perth is said to have written to his lordship asking for the loan of this ex pert headsman, which was complacently granted to them, though with the pro vision that the said executioner vvas to be immediately sent back when required. Such tyranny would have been abso- After all, it may be asked, Were the Highlanders quite unjustified in consider ing the Lowlanders their natural ene mies, and their property fair game? \u25a0Certainly the Lowlanders showed them no mercy, though they conducted their attacks with a g-reater show of lega lity. We have referred already to the mode in which land was held by the Highlanders. We have said that it vvas in the possession ofthe whole community. Such a notion was directly contrary to the genius of the feudal system which prevailed at the Scottish Court. Accord ing to this, the whole land belonged to the king, and it was gifted out amongst Jnis vassals on condition of their render-"], [346, "326 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. lutely intolerable, but it was softened in various ways. There vvas a profound affection and devotion between the High landers and their chiefs, and this, the most pleasing feature of the clan rela tionship, has been also the most enduring. It is certainly not dead even at the pre sent day. French, Norman, and Gaelic extraction.\" A MS. in the possession of some branches of the family declares that the great progenitor of the Grants vvas the God Wodin, who came out of Asia about the year 600 b.c Discarding these absurd inventions, we may safely con- clude that the Grants were Gaels, and perhaps an offshoot of the Macgregors. In the time of Alexander II. there was a certain Gregory de Grant, sheriff of the shire of Inverness, and he is the first eminent member of the clan of whom we have authentic information. From this time, also, we can trace their history down to our own day. Among the many eminent men who led the clan, that mighty warrior, Shemasnan Crcach, or James the Bold, was specially remark- able. He flourished under King James V., was in high favour at court, and was employed on the part of the government in warring against the Lord of the Isles. His successor vvas Evan Baold, or the Gentle, who was an ardent supporter of the reformed faith. Of his successors it cannot be said that they remained con- stant to any one side in the politics of the succeeding reigns, though, on the whole, they inclined to the Protestant and popular interests. Perhaps their feud with the Gordons may have had something to do with that. We shall only add, in conclusion, that the badge of the clan is the pine or cranberry heath, and that the meaning of Craig Elachie is \"The Rock of Alarm,\" though the bravery of the clan on many a field of battle may be said to have changed its. meaning into Rock of Security. The various members of a clan be lieved that they were all more or less nearly related to one another, and they greeted their head with a degree of familiarity that had nothing of disrespect in it. One profoundly touching instance of the fidelity with which the chiefs were served, is given as having taken place at the battle of Inverkeithing between the Royalists and Oliver Cromwell's troops. Sir Hector Maclean, chief of that clan, vvas wounded, and in great danger of his life. He was defended by seven brothers, who, in turn, covered his body with theirs, and each of whom, as he fell dying from the wounds which the superior numbers of the enemy enabled them to inflict, exclaimed, with his last breath, \"Another for Hector!\" This sayinghas become proverbial, as indeed it deserved to be. Instances of this might be multiplied, but we forbear. Faithful ness is a well-known characteristic of the Highlanders, but it is so of the Scotch race in general. It may be as vvell that we should add a word or two as to the Clan Grant, since we have prefixed their slogan to this article. There is considerable dubiety as to the origin of this ancient clan. \"They have,\" says Mr. Skene, \"been said to be of Danish, English,"], [347, "NORTHERN TRADITIONS AND SUPERSTITIONS. 327 Northern Traditions and Superstitions.

Macbeth, before his rebellion, ruled over these parts, and it is said that Malcolm Canmore, after he had crushed all rivals, A hundred years after some Caithness men took refuge in the chapel, but were pursued by their opponents, who barred the door, and then fired the place, slaughtering all the unfortunate victims. For this crime their chief was afterwards executed at Inverness, during one of those short, sharp sessions which James vvas in the habit of holding there. The most famous visitor to the shrine was James IV. His father, James III., had admired it greatly, and had procured charters in its favour from the Pope. His son was struck with remorse for the part he had in his father's death. Besides wearing the renowned heavy girdle round his waist, and even adding to its weight, he made a pilgrimage here every year. Nay, on one occasion, he came thrice in one year. At the same time, we must not suppose that the king went in altogether for austerity \u2014 that because he was virtuous there were no cakes and ale. We have still preserved the accounts of the royal journey, and we there read the following curious items of payments : \"To the madinnis of Forres that dansit to the king, 9s. ; to the madinnis that dansit at Elgin siclyke, 9s. 6d. ; and to the madinnis that dansit at Darnaway, 14s.,\" where he \"tarried\" to visit his early love \"the Lady Jean Kennedy,\" say the historians. He prostrated himself at the northern shrine a month before the fatal field of Flodden, and this must have come to the know- \u25a0constituted this town, and gave it a definite organisation. About these same early times Tain was dignified by the possession ofa Saint \u2014 one Dubhthach, or Duffus \u2014 who dwelt on the \"Angels' Hill,\" as it is still called. The miracles this saint worked were ofthe usual kind, and one example will suffice. When a boy he was sent to a smith's to ask for lire. The man in cruel mockery placed some live coals on his lap, and these he \u25a0carried home without burning his dress. Thus a sort of protection vvas thrown \u2022over the town, and its chapel came to have all the privileges of a sanctu ary. Like all towns on the Highland border, it vvas often exposed to many -dangers from the rude caterans who dwelt in the adjacent hills. One of these was named Poul MacTyre, and from the extent of his depredations he vvas described as a \"very takand man.\" Against such men the protection of a saint could avail nothing, and even men who were more civilised, were often as sacrilegious.

Is it not so called unto this day? Of this chapel, where the Saint not only officiated, but where he is said to have been born, fragments of the walls alone survive. Just as Tain is situated at the opening out of the Domoch Firth, so is Cromarty placed at the entrance to the Cromarty Firth. But its history is not at all remark able. It vvas a royal burgh, but vvas deprived of this right by the influence of Sir Thomas Urquhart. This Sir Thomas was a writer of considerable force and power, and of the most lively imagination. He has favoured us with a History of Cromarty, w7hich, for daring of conception and minuteness of detail, is vvellnigh unrivalled. If the stories it contains are not true, at least they ought to be. \"Alopys, the forty-third in a direct line from Japhet, and contem porary with Rehoboam, the fourth King of Israel, vvas the first who discovered these parts. This individual was con nected with some ofthe most famous cha racters in ancient history. His great grandfather vvas Colcido the Tyrian, who founded Carthage ; his mother vvas the Queen of Sheba.

There was one of them in timately acquainted with Nimrod, the founder of the Assyrian Empire, and the builder of Babel ; another sat with Abra ham in the door of his tent, sharing with him his feelings of sorrow and horror when the fire of destruction vvas falling on the cities of the plain ; a third, after ac companying Bacchus in his expedition to the Indies, and receiving from him in marriage the hand of Thymelica, his The entrance to the bay of Cromarty is by a tolerably wide passage, guarded by two gigantic rocks called the Soutars. The contrast between the vyild waves. that beat the crags on the outside, and the calm waters in the interior of the bay, has been often commented on. The slopes are richly wooded, and a number of fishing villages line the coast. Behind are the inland masses of the Ross-shire hills. Quiet, hard-working, venturesome men are the folk of these fishing villages on the Ross and Cromarty coasts. Many a strange tradition and quaint custom lingers yet among them, as is well known to the readers of the charming writ ings of Hugh Miller, himself as great a literary ornament to Cromarty as quaint old Sir Thomas Urquhart was."], [349, "NORTHERN TRADITIONS AND SUPERSTITIONS. 329 To \"whistle for the wind\" is almost as common as whistling for want of thought, so that does not require much notice ; but a stranger custom is that of quieting the waves by standing up in the boat and waving the hand gently in the direction against which the waves are beating. A great number of the traditions have reference to death. Thus, if one man alone survives out of a drowned crew, he is shunned and despised by the relations of the dead, not so much that a moral stigma is at tached to him as that he is accounted Hugh Miller tells a story in which Calvinism is strangely mixed with fairy lore. An old man who was noted for his piety vvas passing through here one evening. He vvas reading the Bible as he slowly moved along the pathway, and as he vvas quite deaf, took no heed to the murmurs of the brook or the vesper hymn of the birds, when, to his astonishment, his ears, long unused to sound, were pierced by a wail of sorrow. Looking up, he saw \" a beautiful sylph looking female standing before him. She vvas attired in a long flowing SCOTCH FIS IIING-EOAT mantle of g-reen, which concealed her feet, but her breast and arms, which were of exquisite beauty, were un covered.\" \"Old man,\" she said, \"you are reading The Book; tell me if there be any offer of salvation in it to us?\" \"No,\" answered the stern old Calvinist, \"the gospel of this book is addressed to the lost children of Adam, but to the crea tures of no other race.\" Whereupon, with a wild cry of despair, the figure vanished. Perhaps we may imagine her to have been such an one as Fouque describes in his exquisite portrait of fatally accursed. Another story is of the elfin inhabitants of Fairyland. A lady attired in green, and carrying a goblin child in her arms, appears at a cottage at midnight. She blows up the embers of the fire, and bathes her child in the life-blood ofthe youngest member of the household, who is, accordingly, found dead next morning. The fairies here, as elsewhere, have special localities. One of these is Marial's Den, a wild, secluded spot near the town. Here they were wont to hold high parliament during the night. M"], [350, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 330 weeks' tyme.\" Some have maintained that he vvas the author of the famous \"Century of Inventions,\" universally as cribed to the Marquis of Worcester. The work was not published till two years after Urquhart's death, and it may be that the Marquis had found one of the many lost MSS. of Sir Thomas's, and passed it off as his own after that writer's death. But we cannot consider this at all proved yet. The most remarkable work of Sir Thomas, however, is the one we have already noticed, viz., his book on the history of his family and their district, entitled, \"The True Pedigree and Lineal Descent of the Ancient and Honourable Family of Urquhart.\" Our author vvas a cavalier, and stood up for the Stuart cause. When the Scots ad vanced into England he accompanied them, and as his manuscripts were far too precious to be parted with, he carried them with him, \"seven large port mantles,\" as he piteously says, \" full of precious commodity.\" These he left in Worcester, and after that unfortunate bat tle they were seized upon by the soldiers and used for the basest of purposes. The MS. of the Genealogy was about to be used as pipe-lights, when an officer of Colonel Pride's company got hold of it and restored it to its author. \"To what base uses do we come, Horatio,\" must the learned Sir Thomas have re flected, as he half joyfully, half sadly, clasped his recovered MS., and thought of the other ninety and nine. He was afterwards imprisoned in the Tower, and it was to this imprisonment that we owe that remarkable work, the translation of Rabelais, of which the English rea der is constantly prompted to inquire whether the volume owes its merit to the translator or the author \u2014 or whether another man could have ever been found who possessed the vocabulary or the invention required of him who would translate Rabelais. It is indeed a trans lation which being once done, becomes as classical as the original. Undine, who had not a soul till she vvas loved by one of the human race. A place not less famous for the super natural than this glen was the old castle of the Urquharts. It vvas built on the edge ofa lofty ravine, and from the overhanging turrets the spectator could look sheer down to the water beneath. For long the old castle was nearly deserted, and left with but a couple of attendants. These had by no means a pleasant time of it. Strange noises were heard in the long winter nights echoing through the castle; a queer, pinched-up old man was seen \"wringing his hands over a little cairn in a neigh bouring thicket, and extraordinary animals like white rabbits were now and again to be seen shuffling about the pas sages.\" But the castle changed hands, and it was finally demolished, and so the ghosts went too. A strange old family this, and it is not to be wondered that the literary Sir Thomas should have been inclined to invest them with some thing of an apocryphal glory. Yet Sir Thomas vvas by far the most remarkable member of the race himself. The small dark face, the striking eyes, the thin, mocking lips of his portrait, agree admir ably with the character one would natu rally ascribe to him. He vvas born in 1613, and spent many of his earlier years abroad. He spoke French, Spanish, and Italian with the ease and fluency of a native. He might have applied to himself what he said of his country \u2014 that however much it might be surpassed in riches and fertility, in honesty, learn ing, and valour it had no superior. \" Modesty, however, vvas not his strong point. He affirms that he had mastered what was already known, and that it must be added to.\" Hence he composed his great treatise on \" The Universal Language,\" and no less than one hun- dred other works. His fertility was marvellous. He wrote eleven hundred epigrams ; as he tells us, he \" contryved, blocked, and digested these in a thirteen"], [351, "FAIRY TALES. 331 Fairy Tales Of the Northern Shores and Seas.

If a man were daring and ven- turous enough, he might seize her, and compel her to grant him three wishes ; but if he failed, then he was dragged into the sea and never seen more.\" Hugh Miller's legend is that of a love-sick fisherman, who, when wandering by tiie sea-side on the morning of the First of May, heard strains of wondrous and unearthly beauty. He crept nearer, and discovered a mermaid seated on the rock admiring herself in the clear mirror of waters, and combing her hair, singing the song whose notes he had heard. This is simply the Mdrchev aus alten Zeiten, which Heine has told so beautifully to all the world, and which Leyden has also described. ing in this article a few more tales of the spirits and fairies, making them as repre sentative as pos- sible. One story is connected with a wild spot, the valley through which the river Auld grande runs into the Cro- marty Firth. The river in some places flows under- ground, or at least concealed from human view. The bottom of the glen is inaccessible, though it is sometimes crossed by means of the trees that grow on its banks, and which form a natural bridge. Near this is the House of Bal- conie, where a lady once lived of a dark and mysterious nature. She had but one friend of her own choice, and that was, strange enough to tell, one of her own servants. She went with her a walk one evening, and approaching the chasm, suddenly seized her and at- tempted to drag her over. The girl screamed and resisted wildly, when a gentle voice interfered, \"Nay, Madam, your surety must be a willing one,\" and a gentleman in green appeared, who politely stepped up to the lady's side, and courteously handed her \u2014 over the edge of the precipice! Of course it was now but too evident that the lady had sold herself to the Evil One, and that she was attempting to get out of the bar gain by procuring a victim instead of herself.

So he crept nearer, whilst the mermaid, charmed with the sound of her own voice, and fascinated by her beauty, was quite oblivious of his presence, and then he sprang upon her. The struggle was terrible, but at length the mermaid ceased her passionate resistance, and lay completely subdued in his arms. \"Man! whatwithme?\" she said. \"Wishes three,\" he replied, in the orthodox formula, and then he demanded \u2014 First, that neither he nor his friends should be lost at sea ; second, that he should prosper in all his undertakings ; third, that he should win her on whom his heart was set. \"Quit and have,\" said the mer maid. The fisherman was not unwilling to do so, for the beautiful form that lay in his grasp was as cold as a corpse, and there vvas something uncanny in her touch. There vvas a gleam as of the white shoulders of woman and the glit tering scales of fishes, and down in the blue deeps the sailor saw the mermaid disappear from view. He returned home, and in time all that the mermaid pro mised came true to him. decay, so shall grow and decay the for tunes of thy three sons. But in three years you must bring your eldest son to me,\" and so saying, she disappeared. The fisherman might have thought this a dream, but there sure enough in his hands were the twelve grains; so he tried the charm, and everything turned out as the mermaid had foretold. But when the three years had passed, he be came very sorrowful at the thought of sending his bonny boy to Fairyland. So he set out alone, and said to the maiden, when she re-appeared and re minded him of his promise, that he had quite forgotten that this vvas the day. The mermaid did not believe this, but she said nothing, but gave him four years more, at the end of which time he was to deliver up the child without fail. Well, the four years were come and gone, and the old man was now more unwilling than before to part with his first-born. So again he went out alone, and the same thing happened \u2014 only this time he got seven years. Well, the seven years came near their end too, and the fisherman's heart sank within him as he knew that the last of these was running out. Now his son was a fine lad by this time, and when he saw his father so trou bled, he asked him what was the matter. After much persuasion the old man told him, but the boy was not frightened, but said he would go through the world seeking his fortune, and so should be out ofthe sea-maiden's reach; but first he said he must have a strong sword. So his father went to the smith to get him a sword, but when it was made the boy took it and shook it, and lo ! it flew into splinters ; and the smith made him a second sword, but it likewise flew into splinters; but the smith was now put on his mettle, so he made him a third sword, still stronger and better, and this held. So the son bade his father farewell, and took his musket, and the mare's black foal, and whistled to the dog's black pup, and set forth through the world to seek his Another story of water-spirits we give in a condensed form from Campbell's interesting work, \"Popular Tales ofthe West Highlands.\" There was once a poor old fisher and he could get no fish. So a sea-maiden rose up from the water and said to him that if he would give her the first son he had, he would get plenty. The old man promised, but he thought that she only joked with him, for he had but an old mare, an old dog, and an old wife. \"Never mind,\" said the mermaid; \" take these grains of wheat, and give three to thy wife, and three to thy dog, and three to thy mare, and plant three behind thy house ; and it shall come to pass that thy wife shall have three sons, thy mare three foals, thy dog three puppies, and three trees shall grow be hind thy house, and as these grow and"], [353, "FALRY TALES. 333 fortune, and he had only the world for his pillow. Now he had many sur prising adventures. First he killed a deer, and then he met a great dog, a falcon, and an otter, and being fond of all animals, he divided the deer among them, and they said that if swiftness of going, or swimming, or of flying, would ever avail him, they should be there to render it. So a little after he came to the king's house, and there he engaged to be a herd; and while he was feeding* the cattle next day, he heard a loud Hiu, Hau ! Hograich and a fierce giant rushed at him, saying that he would devour him, but with his great sword he cut off the giant's head, and led on his cattle still further in the rich pasture. And then, again, he heard a hideous din, and another great wild giant, worse than the last, came out against him, and said, \" It is a drink of thy blood that quenches my thirst this night ; \" and again there was a fierce combat, but with the help of his black dog he conquered the monster, and cut off his head likewise. But now the herd found that all were getting into great sadness at the castle because a beast with three heads came every year, and lots were drawn which it should get, and this time the lot had fallen on the princess, and she must go. And soon the day appointed she went and sat herself down by a loch at the corner of the shore. But with her there vvas a valiant warrior who vowed he would kill the beast. But when the beast appeared he got frightened and ran away, and the maiden gave herself up for lost, till she saw a handsome youth on a black horse, and by his side ran a black dog and he said he would be her deliverer ; but she must put her gold ring en his finger, and she did so, but did not recognise the herd-laddie of her father. Now the beast appeared, and there vvas a frightful combat, but at last her deliverer suc ceeded in cutting off one of the heads of the monster, whereupon it cried Ravie till the rocks echoed again, and then dis- appeared in the loch with a great splash. \"Ah! but the other two heads!\" said the girl. \" That will follow next,\" replied the youth with a laugh, and then they separated, and the princess returned home bearing with her the giant's head. But on the way she met her coward warrior, and he said that she must sav that he had cut off the head or he would kill her, and she agreed to do so. And so they went on to the palace, and there were great rejoicings as before. And now much the same thing happened the next day, only this time the herd got an earring stuck in his ear; and so the third day, when, after a still more dread ful combat, he killed the beast, and cut off its last head, he made her give him the other earring. But it vvas thought the boastful champion had done this, and so it was settled that he vvas to get the king's daughter. But when they were all as sembled, she said that she would only marry the man who could take the heads off the withy on which they were slung, and the king said that was but just, for \" who should take the heads off the withy but the man that put the heads on ? \" But now it was found that nobody could do this but the herd, and he did it quite easily, to the great astonishment of all. Then said the king's daughter, \"The man that took the heads off the beast, he has my ring and my two earrings,\" and so they were brought forth, and then the two were married; but unfortunately it hap pened that one fine evening, as they were walking by the side of the loch, a beast came suddenly forth and ran off with the princess. Her husband vvas in great perplexity, and really did net know what to do. He consulted an old smith, who said that \"in the midst of the loch is Eillid Chaisfhion, the white footed hind, of the slenderest legs and swiftest step, and though she should be caught, there would spring a hoodie out of her, and though the hoodie should be caught, there would spring a trout out of her, but there is an egg in the mouth"], [354, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 334 of the trout, and the soul of the beast is in the egg, and if the egg breaks, the beast is dead.\" And so he set off; but the only way he could get to the island was by leaping right over to it, and this his black horse did, and with him there leaped the black dog, and right eagerly they hunted the Eillid. But she was very swift of foot, and whilst they were hunt- ing her in one end ofthe island, she would suddenly leap to another. But at this time the man called, and there appeared the great dog which had been for- merly fed with the carcass of deer, and he helped so efficiently, that soon they had the Eillid; but then the hoodie sprang out of her. \" Oh ! \" said the man, \"'tis now were good the falcon grey of swiftest wing,\" and lo! there was the falcon chasing the hoodie, which she soon caught, when out of her the trout fell ; but this the otter soon had, and then from the trout's mouth fell the egg. And now the beast was in a ter- rible state, and he said he would give up everything ifonlythe egg was not broken; but his opponent would make no answer, except saying, \" Give back my wife, give back my wife,\" and the beast vvas exceed- ing afraid, and did so, and then the man smashed the egg, and there was an end of the monster. And so they lived happy for a long time, but at last the man's heart began to weary for more adventures, and as he was in this state, he found there was a little old castle in a dark place by the side of the loch, and so he determined to see what vvas in it, though all the people said that he who went in there would never return ; but go he would. And when he went there vvas an old crone at the door.* Her looks were evil, but her words were smooth and pleasant. She invited him to go in, but as he stepped across the threshold, she drew the Slachan druidhach on him, and he fell dead. So the folk at the palace lamented for him, and also his old father knew some terrible trouble had come upon him, for the tree that before was so green andpleasant vvas now withered and decayed all at once. Then the second son said he would follow his brother, so he went forth on the second black foal, and followed by the second black dog. He was well received at the palace, and the old dame at the castle was quite friendly, but she played the same trick on him as she had on the elder brother, and then there was again lamentation at the palace and the cot- tage, and the second tree withered. But now the third son said he would go and see what was the cause of all this ; though his father tried hard to detain him, it vvas of no avail. Go he would, so he set off, mounted on the third black foal, and with the third black dog, and him too the old woman courteously en- treated to enter. But he made her go in before him, and as she was entering, he cut off her head with his sword. But she seized it and stuck it on as well as ever. And then they had a terrible wrestling match, but finally he got pos- session of the Slachan druidhach, and when he had knocked off her head with that, there was little danger of it coming on again. Then he went into the inner room of the castle, and found there his two brothers, and he touched them with the Slachan druidhach, and they were alive again. We have not given all the incidents of this very complicated story. It may, however, serve as an example of a number of other tales of a like nature. To our mind an old fancy never appears to better advantage than when it is treated by some modern poet, who has the sense to appreciate the fine points of the story, and has the taste to reject the vulgarities and wearisome repetitions which oftentimes disfigure the popular story. There are few better examples of this kind of work than in John Ley den's \"Mermaid,\" of which the opening was considered by Sir Walter Scott to be the very perfection of melodious verse."], [355, "FAIRY TALES. 335 to to Night overtakes them on the voyage. On Jura's heath how sweetly swell The murmurs of the mountain bee ! How softly mourns the writhed shell, Of Jura's shore its parent sea. The moonbeams crisp the curling surge, That streaks with foam the ocean green ; While forward still the rowers urge Their course, a female form was seen. But softer floating o'er the deep, The mermaid's sweet sea-soothing lay, That charmed the dancing waves to sleep, Before the bark of Colonsay.

Pegasus, rather our serviceable hack, in these our wanderings. It is true, indeed, that even he who has drunk-in the placid beauty of Loch Tay, or lis tened to the shrill scream of the eagle from the misty peaks of lofty Ben Nevis, will find much to enlighten and charm him in Sutherland ; but Nature paints in a different way from man. Her own descriptions are infinitely more varied than even the subtle appreciation and expression of a Ruskin can cope with, and as for \" the likes o' us ! \" HE parts of Scot- land we are now surveying present us with some diffi- culties. There is a certain amount of historical inci- dent, but that is very naturally far inferior to what we have in counties like Stirling or Edinburgh, where, in almost every mile of the way, we meet some landmark made famous in song or story. This is only to be expected. Counties that are far removed from the centres of political events cannot be so much the theatres of human actions as those which contain capitals and famous cities. Even yet, though Sutherland is on its eastern side traversed by a railway, the greater part of it is diffi cult to reach. Primitive and simple indeed are the ways of its dwellers, especially of those who inhabit its wes tern and remoter shores, and whose ears are for ever filled with the wild music of the tossing Atlantic. Interesting enough in many respects \u2014 but hardly as regards history or literature \u2014 is this county. And then another difficulty meets us when we attempt to describe the scenery. We have already said much as to Highland scenery, and it would but weary our readers were we to enter into a full detail of this, which we may well call the last county of the Highlands. Itssceneryiswilderand more rugged, indeed, than even the scenery of Perth and Inverness; but we do not know that we could present the points of difference so accurately as to interest the reader who has been so kind as to accompany us on our, we cannot say So it must not be thought that we despise the objects of interest, natural or otherwise, to be found in some of these northern counties, because we pass them by with slight notice. It is simply because the plan of this special volume does not permit us to do them anything like the justice to which they are entitled, and so we beg a humble pardon of the genius that presides over the destinies of Sutherland, and of all those who hold it in reverence. An authority thus briefly points out the chief aspects in the \" superficial con figuration of Sutherland. It is washed by the ocean on three of its five sides. On the west and north coasts, and in the section of country intermediate between the extreme points of these, are groups of huge mountains ; while the rest of the county is spread out in spacious undu lating plains, edged by continuous chains of hills of comparatively moderate height.\" If the reader should have a fancy to go to the diggings, or rather washings, he may possibly be interested in learning that the most precious of all metals is to be found in these parts. Not, indeed, as an \"article of commerce,\" for which he must go further south, but"], [357, "THE WILDS OF SUTHERLAND. 337 in a state of nature; and, moreover, that in the words of Scripture, \" The gold of that land is good.\" Still we are afraid he will hardly find it in sufficient quantity to repay the trouble of working, and unless he is deeply possessed by the sacra fames auri in its most primitive form, he is not likely to betake himself to these parts on such an errand. -rz The north-west cornerof the county ter minates in Cape Wrath, a mass of rocky precipices whose faces are continually beaten by the \" long roll \" of the Atlantic billows. A mass of reefs lies at the base of these precipices, and over these the sea foams and tears in white masses, whilst a little out are some low-lying and desolate-looking islands, which only serve to add to the dreariness of the prospect. According to Sir Walter Scott's description, there is but one nar row creek where it is possible to effect a landing, and even there \"the foam ofthe sea plays at long-bowls w7ith a huge collection of large stones, some of them a ton in weight, but which these fearful billows chuck up and down as a child tosses a ball.\" And yet the very wildness and desolation of the scene has a fasci nation all its own, and such fascination seems continually on the increase. It has been truly remarked that the modern tendency is towards the wild and deso late in scenery, and that it is possible that a future generation may neglect the rich beauty of Heidelberg for the desolate sand-dunes of the North Sea, and prefer the savage wildness of the desert to the trim neatness of the garden. Even in our day men hasten from the rich and fertile fields of Kent and Surrey to gaze with a far keener joy on scenes like that presented to the spectator from Cape Wrath. Perhaps the very contrast has a certain piquant charm in it. The jaded imagination receives an agreeable fillip. But this is not the place to enunciate a philosophy of taste, and we will only add that there is little doubt that scenes of savage wild- ness have a profound charm for the modern imagination, which charm is enhanced by the command over natural objects which the modern intellect has given us. If the steam-engine \u2014 so de rided from an \u00e6sthetic point of view \u2014 be regarded from this side, it will be evident that one of its consequences has been powerfully to develop this by no means quite natural love of wild scenery. But the lover of such scenery would find much to delight him in this shire besides the prospect from Cape Wrath. On the southern edge of the county rises its loftiest peak, Ben More. This moun tain of hard rock is only partially covered with vegetation, and the minor peaks which rise round it on every side con tain dark and inaccessible lakes, which lie hid in the recesses of the mountains. Not far from the foot of this we have Loch Assynt, closely hemmed in by hills on either side, at the foot of which it winds in and out with charming variety. Then there is the coast, deeply indented with bays, and lined with a long suc cession of precipitous cliffs, whilst many of the smaller lochs and mountains pre sent scenes of wild and sterile grandeur such as is scarcely to be found elsewhere in Scotland. Among these wild scenes the Marquis of Montrose wandered in the vain effort to escape his doom. Scott has thus told the story of the \" beginning- of the end\" in the life of that remarkable man : \u2014 \" It appears that Charles II., who never had any deep sense of integrity, vvas willing to treat with both of these parties at one and the same time ; and that he granted a commission to the Marquis to attempt a descent on Scot land, taking the chance of what might be accomplished by his far-famed for tune and dauntless enterprise, while he kept a negotiation afloat with the Pres byterian commissioners, in case of Mont rose's failure. That intrepid but rash enthusiast embarked at Hamburgh with some arms"], [358, "338 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. of showing mercy to him, for he had forsaken the cause. It might, indeed, be pleaded that he w7as true to the king that they had recognised in Scotland ; but, indeed, any plea which he might have made would have had little force. It was an age and a country where death vvas the sure penalty of political, as vvell as military failure ; and Montrose could hardly complain if he vvas called upon to endure the doom which he would certainly, if successful, have inflicted, and his party did afterwards inflict, on their foes. It might be objected that while his death might be considered as just, it vvas accompanied with insult and cruelty of the vilest description. Mr. Burton, with his usual moderation and caution, is inclined to think that some of these accounts were exaggerated. This was, perhaps, the case; but, indeed, the savage hatred of parties in those days was a thing that knew no bounds. Mercy was not heard of. Men were ready to suffer themselves, and they never spared their opponents. Least of all, that party which, whilst it repre sented what was strongest and deepest, and even truest, in Scotch nature, yet also represented what vvas most narrow, and fanatical, and cruel. There could be no better work than to heap every possible ignominy on the man who had agreed to the solemn league and cove nant, and whom they asserted had broken his trust. and treasure, supplied by the northern courts of Europe. His fame drew around him a few of the emigrant Royalists, chiefly Scottish, and he recruited about six hundred German mercenaries. His first descent was on the Orkney Islands, where he forced to arms a few hundreds of unwarlike fishermen. He next dis embarked on the mainland; but the natives fled from him, remembering the former excesses of his army. Strachan, an officer under Lesley, came upon the Marquis by surprise, near a pass called Invercharron, on the confines of Ross shire. The Orkney men made but little resistance ; the Germans retired to a wood, and there surrendered ; the few Scottish companions of Montrose fought bravely, but in vain. Many gallant cavaliers were made prisoners. Mont rose, when the day vvas irretrievably lost, threw off his cloak bearing the star, and afterwards changed clothes with an ordinary Highland kern, that he might endeavour to effect his escape, and swam across the river Kyle. Exhausted with fatigue and hunger, he vvas at length taken by MacLeod of Assint, who happened to be out with a party of his men in arms. The Marquis discovered himself to this man, thinking himself secure of favour, since Assint had been once his own follower. But tempted by a reward of four hundred bolls of meal, this wretched chief delivered his old commander into the unfriendly hands of David Lesley.\" Montrose, though captured alone, did not set out alone on his wanderings ; with him was Lord Kinnoul, but what became of him vvas never known. It vvas April, and theweathervery cold. The fugi tives were supplied with none of the neces saries of life, and as there were none to whom they could look for rest or refresh ment, they must have been separated, and Kinnoul have died of starvation. His fate was easier to be borne than that of his companion. Montrose vvas con ducted to Edinburgh with every mark of disgrace and infamy. No one dreamt Of Montrose himself it may be said that he vvas the very beau ideal of a cavalier. His very faults were those of a \"gentleman\" of the period. Like Froissart, he had little compassion for the sufferings of the \"lower orders.\" His treatment of the town of Dundee, for instance, vvas extremely cruel. But he was deeply loyal to his sovereign, and courteous and considerate to his equals. The lines which he composed at Brussels on hearing the news of the king's death, breathe no spirit of mere sentimental devotion \u2014"], [359, "THE WILDS OF SUTHERLAND. 339 Great, good, and just, could I but rate My grief with thy too rigid fate, I'd weep the world in such a strain As it should delugi once again ; Plis spirit passed away, but it vvas destined to live again in his grandson, Viscount Dundee, who bears in almost every feature of his character the traces of the same mind as that of his cele brated ancestor.

Let us return to it for a few more words. Of buildings we need not say very much. Near Golspie is the huge pile of Dunrobin Castle. The earlier structure, itself of considerable extent, is enclosed in a vast mass of more modern buildings. We need hardly say that the vast wealth of the family to which it belongs has been used to furnish it in the most princely style. It forms a fit residence for a house whose territory might well form a dozen Ger man kingdoms. The riches of the family, it is pleasing to reflect, have been poured out with no stinted hand on more useful, if not so striking objects. The railway which traverses the county is due to the exertions of the Duke of Sutherland, and a part of it is entirely his own property. The county has also a certain proportion of ancient ecclesi astical establishments, ruined castles, and picturesque towers. But it cannot be said that any of these possess any great interest, so we shall, with many apologies, take a respectful leave of Sutherland, and pass on to an almost entirely different scene. \u2014 but show, when we remember his hope less expedition, that he was ready to risk all to avenge the death of his sove reign. The wild daring ofthe expedi tion is in the true cavalier vein. He met his death, not merely with courage \u2014 that was too common a quality to excite much attention, or deserve any praise, however the absence of it might be despised \u2014 but with perfect dignity and serene composure. Even the im placable Argyle wept when he heard the account of the \"last scene of all\" that ended that strange and eventful history. Montrose was something more than a mere soldier. The charming verseswhich he has left behind him show him to have been a man of cultivated intellect and much imagination. It was no mere boast when he promised his \"dear and only love\" \u2014 But if thou wilt prove faithful then, And constant of thy word, I'll make ihee glorious by my pen, And Jnrrroiis by my sword : I'll serve thee in such noble \u00ab ays Was never heard before, I'll crown and deck thee all with bays, And love thee more and more."], [360, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 340 JOHN 0' GROAT'S HOUSE HOTEL A \" Land of Brown PEeath.\" John o' Groat and His House, N Caithness we quite flat and without trees.

Another aspect equally desolate and sublime meets us on the coast. This is precipitous and rugged in no common degree.

Alas for the vessel doomed to be their plaything, or the fleet of fishing boats caught in some unexpected storm ! Many of these rocks are specially re- markable for some fantastic shape or striking peculiarity of outline. Among these we may mention the Great Stack, the Gloop, the Wolf's Choi, and Dun- cansby Head, with its various stack- like divisions, and its rough, weather- beaten appearance. \" The sea comes with its waves, and roars on its hard- ened sides. Its head is covered with foam, and its hills are echoing around.\" It is not merely the scenery that is changed, so are the people, and the language that is spoken. We seem to have come back to the Lowlands. The people have the fair hair and the peculiar steady appearance that betoken a Teutonic race. There is no longer the dark countenance of the Celt; no longerhisg'raceand fireand unsteadiness. The Gaelic language also is not spoken, save in corners near the Highlands. The language is English, spoken perhaps scarcely so correctly as it is a little way south, but more correctly than in the Low- lands. Celtic elements appear, cer- tainly, but they are foreign. The people we soon learn to recognise as Scandi- navian, and the names of their chief settlements are easy and convenient proof of this. Wick is Scandinavian for a bay, so that Wick Bay is a pleonasm ; and Thursoe is Thor's Town, and Holborn Head has almost a Cockney sound about it, though we dare say the Caith ness people give the H and the R and the N in it their full value, and do not elide or soften them as at the other end of the island. They are like the calm dew of the morning on the Hill of Roes, when the sun is faint on its side, and the lake is settled and blue in the vale.\" Hoping that the reader is ofthe same opinion as Cuchullin, we proceed to tell again a few of these tales, and first, of course, we must give precedence to John o' Groat and his famous house \u2014 a house as famous and perhaps as fabulous as that which Jack built. When at school we had a rhyme, of what antiquity we know not, which we used to repeat when rain threatened, under the firm belief that the rain-drops would listen to our prayer, and spend their wrath in another direction \u2014 Rain, rain, rattlestane, Dinna rain on me, But rain on Johnny Groat's house Far ahent the sea. If the reader thinks of visiting this famous erection, we regret to tell him that, even if we allow it once existed, this is certain \u2014 that it exists no longer. The site will be shown him, and he may put up at what we take to be a lineal descendant of that famous building, namely, the John o' Groat's House Hotel, and that is all. But to our story. When James the Fourth, King of Scots, held sway, there stood none higher in hi3 favour than three wealthy Dutchmen, named Malcolm, Gavin, and John de Groat. For commercial purposes they determined to settle in Caithness, and so off they went, carrying- with them a Latin epistle from the monarch, in which he entreated his good subjects of Caithness to show all manner of kindness to these \" trusty and well-beloved\" friends of his. As the Groats had taken the additional testimonial of a well-filled purse with them, they were received with open arms by the inhabitants of those remote parts, and had no difficulty in purchasing a considerable piece of land adjacent to the spot where, according to tradition, John o' Groat's house once stood. They According to Ossian, \"Pleasant are the words of the song, said Cuchullin, and lovely are the tales of other times."], [362, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 342 for their own private ends. So now the question came to be, who was to be head of the clan? They each and all laid claim to this honour. One affirmed that he was richest, another was known to be oldest, a third vvas thought (by himself) to be wisest, andsoon among the were diligent and prospered exceedingly, and increased in number, till eight branches of the family of Groat, each possessing its separate estate, were to be found in the neighbourhood. But now, alas\u2014 for this honest family! As they began to increase in riches, their hearts began to swell within them. Instead of rest. Now the Groats had an excellent the Gi.oor. an honest burgher family, they began to imagine themselves some mighty clan of vast antiquity, and no doubt a number of those individuals, whom the acts of the old Scotch Parliaments, with but the most scanty reverence for literature, called \"bardis and other sic lik runners about,\" were to be found puffing them up custom. Every year they had a great family banquet, at which the whole eight were wont to be present, and there they met and discussed their affairs, and gave each other good advice, and discussed as to how the family affairs were getting on, and drank and ate to their hearts' content, and generally had a"], [363, "A \"LAND OF BROWN HEATH\" 343 good time of it. But on the occasion after this unlucky headship question vvas mooted there was nothing of this; each was occupied in asserting his own claim to sit at the head of the table, to lead the clan in war (it vvas vvell known that the Groats were the most law-abiding people in these parts), and finally adjured them to let the question rest till their next meeting, when he pro mised that it should be settled to the absolute satisfaction of every one pre sent. They agreed, and next year they approached the place of meeting, each determined to contest his right of chieftainship to the death, when lo ! full DUNCANSBY HEAD. so on, so that neither business nor pleasure could be proceeded with. In the midst of all this old John de Groat, who had a right, if any one had, to be the chief of the clan, implored a moment's silence. He urged on them the ad vantages of union and the danger of disunion, but all to little purpose, till he on their astonished gaze burst John o' Groat's house! In shape it was a per fect octagon. It had eight doors and eight windows, and within it vvas an octagonal table with eight chairs ranged round it, and in one of them old John o' Groat was already seated, beaming with satisfaction at having so neatly settled"], [364, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 344 are ruined. Like most structures of the sort, they are placed in a spot apparently carefully selected for its picturesqueness and inconvenience. The explanation of this circumstance is easy. Inaccessibility vvas the chief virtue of such dwellings. Hence any rocky headland projecting into the sea, or any rock peculiarly difficult of access, was sure to be selected. As the coast of Caithness presents numerous and strik- ing examples of this natural formation, the builders of the castles had many spots to choose from, and to this we must ascribe the peculiar wildness of the situation of most of these edifices. With nearly every one of them there is con- nected some wild deed of treachery or revenge, just or unjust. A strange history is connected with the castle of Berrydale, last possessed by a giant named William More. When the giant was a boy, Robert Gun of Braemere had fallen violently in love with his mother, and had obtained possession of her by the treacherous murder of her husband. The story is a wicked and revolting one, with many complications, and we shall not repeat it. Suffice it to say, that when the giant grew up, he agreed to go to Orkney with the Earl of Caithness, and to put off his revenge till his return. But he had a presentiment that he would never return, and desirous that posterity should not lose the memory of so \"proper\" a youth, he lay down at full length on the ground and desired his companions to mark the spot. This vvas done. Stones were erected to commemorate the occurrence (are they not to be seen to this day ?), and the distance between these was found to be nine feet five inches. The poor giant's forebodings proved quite correct. He fell in battle along with the Earl of Caithness and his sons. such a knotty point. There vvas a good deal of sense in the family, and they at once accepted the solution, toasted with right good will the venerable John, and yearly assembled at this new rendezvous, and so in high good humour disappear from the page of history. The problem of the Head of the Table was a somewhat knotty one, and it may be that further south it could not have been so easily settled. The completest solution vvas that given by some madly conceited Highland chieftain, perhaps the McNab, who, when dining with some dignitary, quietly took up a place near the bottom of the table. The dignitary thought he knew his guest, and vvas considerably astonished at such unlooked for humility. He begged the chieftain to take a seat near himself, but this courteous offer was calmly de clined. \" Where,\" replied the guest, with sublime conceit, \" the McNab sits, there is the head of the table.\" In passing from this quaint story of John o' Groat's house, it may be remarked that the tale, curious though it is, has hardly sufficient merit in itself to account for its wide spread renown. John o' Groat's house has come to be considered as typifying the end of Scottish earth \u2014 \"From Maidenkirk to John o' Groat's,\" says Burns, and hence everything con nected with it has obtained a wider notice than would otherwise be the case. Caithness, like most other parts of Scotland, possesses a great number of old castles \u2014 Buchollie, Berrydale, Dun beath, Braal, Dirlet, and many others. Most of these are complete ruins \u2014 not that, from an artist's, or indeed from a human point of view, they are the worse for that. Travellers up the Rhine are, we think, agreed that the two or three restored castles, even though the restoration has undoubtedly been carefully carried out, are among the least pleasing objects on the banks; and when we think of the deeds that have taken place within their walls, we may well be glad that they The square tower of Braal, near the river Thurso, is worthy of a passing notice.

It is built of enormous blocks of stone, on which no mark of the chisel is to be seen, and it is difficult to conjecture how it vvas pos sible, in an age so rude, and without the aid of the simplest mechanical contri vances, to fit such masses so accurately into their place. We can only allude to Dirlet Castle, situated on an almost perpendicular rock, the base of which is washed by the river Thurso.

Of these islands there are sixty-seven, and somewhat less than the half are inhabited by a population which amounts to more than 30,000. As they are now connected with London by electric telegraph, and as there is a railway as near as Wick, it cannot be said that they are excessively far away, and yet there is still an idea of remoteness connected with them. Perhaps this is a memory of the days when the railway and the steam-ship, and still more important in this age of news, the electric telegraph, were not ; when the sailing vessels that were the only means of communication were liable to be detained on theirvoyage for an indefinite period, and when the islanders were content to go on placidly their own way, and let the great world wag as it pleased. How far off they used to be from means of communica tion may be judged by one striking instance. The clergy continued dutifully praying for James II. as King of Great Britain and Ireland three months after he had abdicated, or, as the Scottish Parlia ment emphatically put it, \" forfaulted the crown,\" as they were in total ignorance of the blessings already secured to them by the Revolution settlement. A number of the islands are bare, barren heath, low-lying and exposed to the beating of the sea, whose foam flies far across them ; others are surrounded with ramparts of huge rocks, against which the rushing waves thunder, though not quite in vain. The climate is"], [367, "SOME RANDOM NOTES ON THE ORKNE Y ISLANDS. 347 moist and cold, but fairly equable, and not so severe as might be expected from such high latitudes. There are, .however, certain phenomena to be ob served which' remind one of the arctic latitudes. In the summer it is scarcely ever dusk, and certainly never dark, for at midnight it is quite possible to read without the aid of artificial light. Those who have experienced the beauty of these long evenings \u2014 when the day, like the dying dolphin of poetic fiction, goes \u2022through every phase of colour, and when each tender shade is succeeded by another more delicate in an almost end less succession, till the still grey of the late twilight is felt as a relief from the \u25a0ever-changing panorama of beauty \u2014 will recognise how much this makes up for the warmer days and nights of the sunnier south. In winter this is balanced by the very great length of the nights, but here another arctic phenomenon lends its occasional assistance to relieve the darkness. The aurora borealis shoots its strange gleam across the sky, and its fitful flash lights up the dark winter night with unearthly splendour. Many of the peculiarities of the Orkneys andShetlands are due to the fact that they were only incorporated with the Scottish crown in the 15th century, when James the Third received them as a marriage dowry when he married the daughter of the then King ot Denmark, and with such a remote district, separated from the mainland by a stormy sea, it was long before this incorporation began to take effect. It is pleasing to reflect that this distant part of the ancient kingdom of Scotland has shared to the full in that great wave of improvement which has spread itself over the country during the last hundred years, though the traveller may be excused if he regrets the rapid disappearance of many a quaint old custom, which, harmless in itself, seemed to diversify the ever increasing- same ness and monotony of the national life ot Britain. It has been frequently remarked that everything in this world is relative, and the name of the largest island in the Orkneys is a proof of this, for whilst it is an island only to the Caithness folk, it is thought deserving- of the name of Mainland from the Orcadians them selves. Of course it might also be re marked, were we to consider the case curiously, that the larger mainland is itself an island with regard to Europe; but we shall not enter into a philosophical discussion, but moor our \"nodding ships \" in Kirkwall harbour. In Kirk wall there are a good many objects that would vvell repay a lengthened inspec tion. First and foremost there is the magnificent cathedral, which, not merely beautiful in itself, possesses the almost, Although the islands cannot be called fertile, yet this name may, with the strictest propriety, be applied to the waters around them. The \"harvest of the sea\" is very great, and the islanders find their chief occupation in gathering it in. Agriculture has much improved -of late years, and modern instruments and methods of husbandry are fully taken advantage of. A great num ber of the people \u2014 at one time pro bably this was the case with all the occupiers \u2014 are odal possessors of the land. Those who hold under this tenure possess the land by a sort of peasant proprietorship, absolutely unburdened by the payment of dues to any superior. In past times the islanders were cruelly treated. They were far from the seat of o-overnment, and the islands were often \u2022rifted out to adventurers, with but scanty regard for the rights that existed there. \u2014 were it not for Glasgow \u2014 the quite unique distinction of having escaped the misplaced zeal of the Reformers. The tower, indeed, is not perfect, but this is due to a storm of nature, not of man. The origin of this noble pile was as follows : \u2014 Two Earls once ruled in Orkney, whose names were Haco and Magnus. They were cousins, but this"], [368, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 348 I quer Scotland \u2014 an attempt to be fatally crushed at Largs \u2014 took refuge, and here its leader Haco, \"last ofthe sea-kings,\" passed away whilst the priests were reciting the lives of the saints, and his old comrades were chanting sagas from Norwegian history round his bedside. The body lay for some time in the church, and vvas removed in spring to Norway. Bishop Thomas Tulloch, Lord Adam Stewart, brother of James V., several of the Earls of Morton, and many others, are interred here. Of an Earl of Morton, \" one of the ravenous race of crown donatives,\" we are told that wishing, with commendable filial piety to erect a monument \"upon the corp of his umquhile father,\" and at the same time having, like Mrs. Gilpin, a \" frugal mind,\" he got permission from a too indulgent session to tear up the magnificent marble slabs from the floor of the cathedral, and use them for the monument. did not prevent Haco, jealous of the ever increasing power which the good deeds of Magnus were bringing to him, from basely putting an end to his co ruler's life. The mother of the murdered man with difficulty rescued his body from the hands of the tyrant. It was buried in Christ Church, Birsay, and the tomb '\u2022 emitted a lustrous light and delicious odour.\" It soon became a shrine to which pilgrimages were made. Revenge seemed long delayed. The murderer lived in peace and power, and on dying, left the islands to his son. For a time he vvas able to ward off all attacks, but at last an expedition came out from Norway against him, whose leader, Rognvold, a relative of Magnus, swore, if successful, to erect a stately shrine to the memory of the sainted martyr. Rognvold vvas completely successful. He succeeded to the Earldom of Orkney, and at once proceeded to put his vow into execution. The stately cathedral rose, and as it approached completion the remains of Magnus were removed thence, and it was solemnly consecrated in his honour. To the east of the town there are still to be seen the remains of the once extensive Bishop's Palace, which by its size and splendour bore witness to the greatness of the ecclesiastics. Both the piety and the wickedness of the Orcadians were turned to account to augment the wealth of the clergy. The pious gave of their own free will, the wicked were mulcted for their sins. \"The old bishopric of Orkney,\" says an ecclesiastical writer, \" became a great thing, and lay sparsim throughout the haill parachines of Orkney and Zetland. Besyde his lands he had the teyndis of auchtene Kirks ; his lands grew daily as various crimes increased in the counties.\" Amidst the graves there is one more in teresting by far than any we have men tioned. It is in thechoir; but nomonument marks it, nor can we even tell the exact place where the ashes rest. And yet if there was any fitness in thing's, if the monument over the remains of the de parted were to be proportionate to the grief of the survivors and the loss this death caused, we do not know a tomb ever raised that ought to have been more splendid. Here is laid the dust of Margaret, Maid of Norway, a little child of eight years, whose death so profoundly influenced the whole course of Scottish history. One is tempted to engage in that most profitless of all tasks \u2014 an in quiry into the \"might-have-beens\" of history \u2014 by a case such as this.

The nation passed through the fire; but it came forth purified in the process. some degree united by the Bridge of Broisgar, a long causeway, containing openings to permit the flow and reflux of the tide. Behind him, and fronting to the bridge, stood that remarkable semicircle of huge upright stones, which has no rival in Britain save the inimitable monument at Stonehenge. These im mense blocks of stone, all of them above twelve feet, and several being even above fourteen or fifteen feet in height, stood round the pirate in the grey light of the dawning, like the phantom forms of antediluvian giants, who, shrouded in the habiliments of the dead, came to revisit, by this pale light, the earth which they had plagued by their oppression, and polluted by their sin, till they brought down upon it the vengeance of long-suffering Heaven.\" In this same work of Scott's allusion is specially made to one of them called the Stone of Odin. There was a hole in this a little way above the ground, and through it Orcadian lovers were wont to join hands as they swore to be true to each other. The stone vvas after wards destroyed, and the fragments used in the erection of a cow-house ! Surely the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments was not estab lished a day too soon. What these stones were erected for it is in vain to conjecture. We may believe that they had something to do with rites of \"a creed outworn,\" but that is all, and even this we only believe because it is the only solution, or attempt towards a solution, that remains when everything else is exhausted. Where there is so little ascertained fact, there is ample room for ingenious nonsense, and not even the great pyramid has been more whimsically accounted for than the Standing Stone of Scotland. As to Orcadian folk and their customs, writers and visitors have given a favourable verdict. \" They are,\" it has been said, '' kind without caressing, civil without ceremony, and respectful without com- We shall now, in the briefest possible fashion, notice a few of the remaining notabilia of Orkney. This same island, or Mainland, contains a number of the structures called \"Picts' houses.\" These externally are of the appearance of truncated cones, and consist of several cells. There are no passages for com munication with the outer world, and from this and the fact that within human bones, and the bones of birdsand animals have been found,. it is believed they were used as a depository for the remains of the departed. \"In one of these apartments,\" says a traveller, \" was found an entire human skeleton, in a prone attitude; but in the others the bones were not only separated from one another, but divided into very small fragments.\" Some have supposed that the upper parts of the buildings have disappeared, and that those parts that remain were used as larders, and that the inhabitants of these parts were cannibals! There are modi fications in the structure of the various houses, and they may have been used for various purposes, but for what, nothing can be definitely said. We have almost equal difficulty in determin ing the meaning of the curious standing stones which exist in nearly all the islands. Some of these are single, whilst others are in circles. The most remarkable are the stones of Stennis, which form two great circles on either side of the Loch of Stennis. They are thus charmingly described in the \"Pirate\" : \u2014 \" When Cleveland awoke the grey dawn vvas already mingling with the twilight of an Orcadian night.

The scenery is very much wilder, and the land is still more barren. There are about a hundred islands, and of these less than half are inhabited. The coast line is very rough and rocky. There are a vast number of caves in the face of the lofty cliffs. These stretch a long way inland, and in stormy weather the sea dashes far into them, and the reverberation can be heard at a great distance. These cliffs and caves are of all possible varieties and shapes. Some times we have a number of \" stacks \""], [372, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 352 rising out from the sea near the coast. These are pierced through and through with passages, whilst a cap of green verdure clothes the summit of the bare perpendicular wall. Some of the caves are very large.

This breach, named the Grind of the Navir, is widened every winter by the overwhelming surge, which, finding a passage through it, separates large stones from its side, and forces them to a distance of no less than 1S0 feet.\" As in Orkney, a peculiarly desolate and bare appearance is given to the land scape by the total absence of trees. All Nature's pictures in Shetland are con structed with three materials : the wild moor, the wild sea, and the wild rocks. ings present a rather curious appearance. It is as if the sea had suddenly risen and floated them, and after twisting and twirling them about in all directions, had suddenly retired. The houses then apparently took root just where they had been thrown, and thus accommodated themselves to circumstances in the easiest of fashions. One might forgive a good deal for the sake of picturesque effect, but to have an occasional house in the middle of the street is rather awkward. But, as we had occasion before to remark, everything in this world is rela tive ; and if you get entangled in some of these little narrow lanes and curious courts with which this main street com municates, you will come to consider it a very wonder of width, cleanliness, and sweet smells. But we shall get into trouble if we begin to abuse Shetland and Lerwick, and the dwellers therein, for the native writers (and who ought to know better?) unanimously agree in describing the islanders as vvell spoken and pleasant of manner, kind to strangers, and exceptionally vvell edu cated.. Nay, some have even been found to declare them too highly civi lised ; that the ladies are inordinately given to tea-drinking and fine dress. If this be so it ought to be remembered that the fair islanders at least earn the money they spend on those amusements. They knit stockings enough, one would think, to supply the feet of all the human race, for they are all always knitting. and, says this critic, \" They are rarely if ever, paid for their work in money, so they take from the merchants just what they can get [this at least shows an easily contented disposition!] This tea-drinking vvith the older dames has grown to be almost a vice, while the love of gay dress has been fostered to an inordinate degree in many of the young knitters. On Sunday they emerge from their smoky huts a la mode du beau monde, dressed all of them like brides, and meeting them thus gaily decked, you As in Orkney, so here, the largest island of the group is called Mainland, and about the middle of it, fronting the island of Bressa, is Lerwick, the capital, a small but prosperous and busy place. The town, unlike most of the Scotch towns, is not a place of great antiquity, and is little more than 250 years old. It was built as a station for the Dutch herring vessels, which at that time carried on a considerable trade in these parts. At present Lerwick presents the appearance of a \" sort of vulgar Venice.\" A great many of the old weather-beaten houses are washed on one side by the sea, and they are frequently provided with two doors \u2014 one opening on the sea, and the other on the land. These form one side of the chief street, which runs along parallel to the beach. The dwell-"], [373, "ULTIMA THULE. 353 could not imagine that they lived in such hovels, were it not that they perfume the air around them with a strong odour of peat reek.\" The same writer bears witness to the zeal and fidelity with which they attend church, and their punctuality in the performance of all religious duties, and though he informs us that in some of the country parishes the collection often only amounts to threepence, yet this is not, we are sure, the case in their metropolis. But let us cease poking fun at these simple and honest islanders, and rather congratulate ourselves that the frontiers of our empire are inhabited by such a fine race of people. Even the faults of the Shet landers seem things of the past. The houses in the sea were built to aid, it is said, in smuggling. The Dutch boats crept up to the sea-door under cover of night, and there unloaded, and departed by the same silent highway they had used in coming. Smuggling was at one time very prevalent, and at the close ot the last century, and beginning of this, it vvas thus that the bulk of the inhabi tants supported themselves. Wiser excise regulations have now made this practically a thing of the past. A still worse custom was that of wrecking. To such an extent had this practice gone, that the local ruler actually decreed severe punishment against such as were so forgetful as to assist a vessel in dis tress, whilst a strange superstition which seemed, and, indeed, in some way or other, probably had been invented for the purpose of aiding this cruel occupa tion, affirmed it to be exceedingly unlucky to help a drowning man, and that the man saved would at some future time bring grievous hurt to his saviour. \"Wrecking\" is an offence which has always been looked on with just harshness. Perhaps the wrecker's view was that if people were to be wrecked, he might as well get the benefit of it as the sea, and from this the step that led to the remains of a lost vessel being considered fair game, and even to the taking of steps to aid its destruction, would only be too swift. The wreckers are now as extinct as the Vikings and as the Pirates, though we suppose that still, if an islander finds some \"flotsam and jetsam\" at his feet, he may stoop to pick it up without strictly attending to Her Majesty's rights. The only accusation that seems ever now to be brought against the Shet landers is that they sometimes charge very high for the use of their boats ; but this only means, we presume, that they are good political economists, and thus try to buy in the cheapest, and sell in the dearest market! It is impossible to talk of Shetland without saying a word about the Shet land pony. Those animals ran about at one time almost wild. They were reared by the community for the good of the community, but of late years the demand for them has grown so strong that they have been kept as the most valuable kind of private property. Their small size is, perhaps, to be attributed to the difficulty they experience in obtaining nourishment. Sometimes they are forced to betake themselves to the sea-beach, where they eat tangle and sea-weed. Their owners only give them fodder in snowy weather, when such is absolutely necessary to keep them alive. Even a big Shetland pony is a small animal, and a small Shetland pony is a veiy small animal indeed; as small, some times, as thirty inches, and quite fit to be used as a drawing-room pet. As is natural in animals living in such a place, they are very sure-footed, and, what is more, have a wonderful knack of finding their way home again, which is very convenient to the traveller who has lost his way, and finds it by far the best plan to throw his reins on his steed's neck and trust to Providence and the pony, though it is only out of Shetland that it is called a pony\u2014 there it is dignified with the more imposing appellation of horse."], [374, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 354 said of Shetland, and in both cases there are one or two modes of animal life which we usually associate in our thoughts with \" high latitudes.\" Occa- sional shoals or schools of whales visit these parts, and it is a red-letter day among the fishermen if they are able to capture one or more of these leviathans of the deep \u2014 \" Hugest of beast that swims.\" The seal are regular \"habitues\" of the cliffs, and are regarded with peculiar awe and distrust by the islanders. They were supposed to be mermen and mer- maidens, whose usual habitations were lofty coral halls and noble grottoes far down in the deep. They sometimes had a fancy for visiting the upper world, and in doing so clad themselves in those rough forms that we call seals. These sclkies \" at night again disrobed them- selves of their seal skins and boasting forms, beautiful beyond description, held their midnight revels in the pale moonlight amidst the surge that broke over the skerries. Many wonderful stories are told about them ; they are said to have carried shipwrecked fisher- men on their backs safe to the shores of Papa\" \u2014 which vvas really very kind of them, considering the light in which they have been regarded. There is always something grand and fascinating about the superstitions ofa race. We suppose it is natural to be superstitious, and since science sternly forbids us to indulge the fancy, we delight to hear about it in others. So rare is the belief in ghosts now, that we remember a peasant \u2014 on the ground that is round Burg Rodenstein, the Castle of the Wild Huntsmen, hidden far away in the green Odenwald\u2014 looking quite insulted when we asked him if the wild hunt was ever seen now, and quite plainly intimating that the whole busi- ness was entirely fabulous ; and so, even in these remote parts, could there really be found one who would do battle for the existence of the Mermaid ? Still, the old stories are preserved and handed down, but rather in the way of delecta- We may here add a word about some of the wild inhabitants of those islands, and first must come the eag-le. The king of birds usually has his abode amidst the inaccessible cliffs which abound on the west shore of the island. Sometimes he may be seen resting on a little island in the middle of a loch. There are, however, only a very few of these birds to be found there. Much more destructive than the eagle is the raven, which attacks lambs, goslings \u2014 aye, even ponies \u2014 in the fol lowing- fashion, which, whether true or not, is at least curious : \u2014 \" Corby sees a pony lying down to rest, or standing listless and forlorn-looking- near a dyke; w7ith an impatient croak he darts down, and at one stroke pierces the eye of the poor animal, which immediately rolls itself in its agony, generally with the injured eye next to the ground. This leaves the other eye a mark for the murderer, and another stroke blinds his victim. A third attack is made about the tail, and then he soars away with his malign triumphant croak, croak, croak. He knows that he has given the poor pony his death wound, and he will return in a few days to the carrion, which it is decidedly the best policy to leave for his use, that he may be driven the less to create new prey in a similar manner.\" We must confess to a certain scepticism about this singular account, and especi ally cannot understand why \" about the tail\" should be a vulnerable part in Shetland ponies. The commonest birds in Shetland \u2014 those that the traveller sees in vast masses covering the rocks or sailing in the air, and mingling their voices with the hoarse voice of the ocean \u2014 are the rock-pigeon, the sea-mew, and thekittiwake. Shags and scarfs, or cor morants, also exist in considerable numbers.

Of course the same may be"], [375, "ULTIMA THULE. 355 tion for the learned, than for the delight of the peasant. _j6, which we are told is by no means rare in the slums of the Cowgate, and besides that this cottage is pretty vvell open to the winds of heaven, we can reflect, at any rate, that its inhabitants might be worse off. The fire is in the middle of the floor, and the smoke finds easy exit from a hole in the roof, from which a chain or rope depends, and on this the iron kettle used in cooking is slung. A spinning-wheel is in one corner, and at it an old dame is busily engaged in spinning. Opposite sits the materfamiiias engaged in some household duty. The remaining chair in the room is occupied by a boy, who is eating his simple dinner of dried fish with the keenest of appetites. Lines are stretched across the room almost as high as the ceiling, or, rather, the bottom of the rafters, for there is no ceiling, and on this are hung a great number of dried fish, or fish in the process of drying. An antique and capacious box-bed, carefully folded up, protrudes some way into the room, and near it there is a plain but substantial wooden chest, used, we presume \u2014 for it is shut \u2014 as the receptacle for the Sun- day finery of the family. A few tables and boxes complete the furniture. The walls are plentifully garnished with hooks, on which hang various articles for household attire and use ; the faith- ful collie sleeps in peace on the rough earthen floor, on which we also notice a pair of huge fisherman's boots, and some flasks. This is by no means, how- ever, a high-class Shetland cottage, for some of them are so large as to be divided into two tolerably big rooms. There is both a proper floor and a ceil ing to the better room. The walls are whitewashed, and the window is com paratively large. One excellent quality our Shetlanders possess, and this is that of simple statement of fact, unencumbered by any sort of circumlocution. This epitaph from the churchyard at Hillswick is charming \u2014 \" Here lies Donald Robert son, to all appearance a sincere Chris tian, whose death was caused by the stupidity of Lawrence Tulloch, who sold him nitre instead of Epsom salts.\". If all history had been written in this plain, unvarnished, truthful style, how strangely different it would be from the history we know. This same simple directness of statement is shown in the more remote parts of the island in most amusing ways. \"I learned,\" says Mr. Reid, in his interesting \"Art Rambles,\" in speaking of the island of Foula, \"from the fishermen that no later than yesterday the lighthouse steamer steamed as close up to the rocks at the south creek as if the captain had been acquainted with the coast from boyhood. As this vvas the first time the islanders had seen a steamer near the island, they were greatly astonished ; and a few having heard of the doings of the press gangs in days of yore, hid themselves for fear. However, the peaceable errand of the Pharos once known, the intelligence soon spread, and all the natives who chose were invited on board, a treat which will be long re membered, together with the fact that the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, whom they designated the 'greatest man in Scotland,' had landed on the island, and purchased a few dozen eggs and a couple of codfish.\" Mr. Reid also gives a drawing of a Shetland interior, which, in picture, looks very cosy and comfortable, though unmistakably primitive. The same apartment serves for dining-room, sleep ing-room, sitting-room, etc., but when we think of the ' families in each corner and a lodger in the middle of the floor,' In talking of Shetland we have as yet said nothing of Fair Isle, which lies between it and the Orkneys.

At a distance, and in sum mer weather, this wild mass of rock may be advantageous as a land-mark; but in foggy weather, and in the stormy winter months, it is very dangerous indeed. \" The island is girt about with a rugged perpendicular wall of sand stone, diversified with bold, grotesque headlands, gios, and stacks standing in solitary grandeur, around which circling wreaths of foam are ever winding, and over which the huge rollers from the Atlantic leap sportively, that they may course with unbroken power through dismal caves, where, after passing through tortuous tunnels black as night, they again greet the light of day, boiling at the foot of mighty shafts which pierce the cliff three hundred feet overhead.\" Here, as might be expected, most things are primitive and out-of-the way enough. \" The fashionable mode of sitting in church is for each to have his arm round his partner's waist, whilst the young married couples are very affectionate, and it is nothing extraordi nary for the wife to put her arm round her husband's neck, draw his head under the bookboard, and kiss him.\" Mousa, a little spot on the east side of Mainland, is remarkable for a so-called \"Pictish Castle.\" This is simply a round tower, something like the section of one of the huge chimneys of our great manu facturing centres. It measures fifty feet in diameter, and is about forty-two feet high. There is a tower within the tower \u2014 the space between the walls is five feet, and the walls themselves are of enor mous thickness. The windows are very small, loop-holes in fact, whilst the visitor must crawl on hands and knees in at the doorway. And yet this un couth building vvas the scene of a drama of passionate love. At one time there were double earls in Orkney. Their names were Erlend and Harold, and they were both young men. Now Harold's mother vvas a lady of great beauty, and Erlend fell passionately in love with her. She returned his love, but Harold, who thought it might inter fere with his ambitious plans, sternly forbade the union. Harold's father, it may not be quite unnecessary to mention, vvas dead. The pair, however, were de termined to be united, and so united they were, and fled to this lonely tower, \" within the dark recesses of which they nestled like two pigeons in a dove-cot.\" The undutiful son pursued them, and beset the castle with troops, but its strong walls were faithful to those they defended, and Harold had to sit down before the place for a regular siege. Fortunately, during this he had timeto cool a little. He recollected that the conduct of his beauti ful mother during her long widowhood had not been quite irreproachable; that, indeed, there were certain things re ported of her to which this was but a trifle, and that, on the whole, it was When the Spaniards were thrown ashore they were almost quite destitute of provisions, and the islanders, from their scanty stores, were only able to afford them a very moderate supply, so that they were put to great straits before they were able to :embark again. Some plaids of a curious fashion are knitted here, and the only counterpart to them is a species of Spanish cloak, so we may fairly conclude that this is one memento, at least, of that remarkable fleet. At one of the many wrecks which have taken place on this lonely spot, the crew were saved in an extraordinary manner. The vessel was stranded at"], [377, "ULTIMA THULE. 357 probably better that this lovely and charming widow should have somebody whose special duty it would be to look after her. So, as the chronicler tells us, \"a reconciliation took place, and then, with great joy, returned the parties to their several pursuits, well satisfied with each other. Such is the story chronicled by Torfoeus concerning the siege of Moseyaburgum and the loves of Dame Near the Mainland, north from Ler wick, there is an isolated rock, on which are a few fragments of a castle that once stood there. It is called Frau-a-stack, or the Maiden's Stack, and this is its story. There was once a wealthy Shetlander who had a lovely daughter. But though lovely, she was wilful, and it happened that among the host of her acquaint ances, there was one whom her father Margareta and Erlend.\" evidently detested. He was dark and Another much more imposing castle is handsome, brave and daring, generous to a fault, aye, even prodigal and reck less of money, as if it were of no more that of Scalloway ; this is situated about the same latitude as Lerwick, but on the west side of Mainland. It was built in 1600, by the cruel Earl Patrick Stewart, who expiated a long series of crimes at Edinburgh under the hands of the exe cutioner. They built well in those days, whether the use of the building vvas to value than the foam which even in calm weather curled round the base of the rock that he saw from his castle win- dows. The old gentleman thought with a groan of the rate at which his sacks of gold would be depleted by this young spendthrift, if he should succeed in getting his daughter. And then his daughter unfortunately was so fond of him! \u2014 there was no denying it. She said she would have him, and he said he would have her, and what was the old gentleman to do ? But as he looked at the rock, a bright thought oc- curred to him. He would build a lady's bovver on the rock, and there the lady should remain till she had given up all such absurd fancies as this. In due time the stone structure was raised, and the damsel, after weeping many unavailing tears, was safely placed in it. She still vowed that nothing would induce her to give up her lover. Did not the old gentle- man know that love laughs at locksmiths? So it proved in this case, for one night, when the waves were wildly dashing against the cliffs, the lover adventured the daring exploit, moored his little boat in a cave at the foot of the stack, and then up! up! he climbed the steep ascent, till the lady, who sat wearily listening to the storm, and thinking of him, heard through all the wild raging of the sea and wind, the tapping at the casement, and lo! here vvas her lover! When morning came, and the domestics be for good or ill. The castle is unroofed, but the walls still rise strong and entire, domineering over the few humble cot- tages which seem to cower in terror, as no doubt the inhabitants of the placeonce did at the base. In the castle is an iron hook, fromwhich the prisoners were suspended, whether finally or temporarily does not appear. Scalloway was once the capital of Shetland, and here the courts of law, and what men called justice, were held. Near it there is a slight elevation. It is green and pleasant to the eye, and at its foot grow almost the only trees to be found in Shetland. If there were any fitness in things, it ought to be for ever blasted by the fire that human cruelty once kindled on its summit, and the curse that David of old called down on the mountain of Gilboah \u2014 the curse that passionately prayed they might for ever be deprived of heaven's nurture \u2014 might vvell too fall on this hill. Again and again were persons accused of witch- craft burned on this \" Gallows Hill,\" as it is still called. The very last execu tions that took place in the island were when Barbara Tulloch and her daughter Ellen King were burned to death for this imaginary crime."], [378, "358 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. went to the stack, carrying with them the day's provisions for their fair pri- soner, they found, to their despair, that she had escaped. There were the marks ofthe way the lover had climbed, and also the marks ofthe difficult and dangerous descent \u2014 now and then, perhaps, a shred of woman's dress, torn off by some jagged point, and fluttering like a tell- tale flag in the morning wind. When the old gentleman heard of all this, he vvas horrified at the thought of the danger which his daughter seemed so narrowly to have escaped, and moreover he felt a good deal of remorse as he re- flected on his own cruel barbarity. So he forgave the couple as soon as they asked for it, which they did like dutiful children immediately upon their mar- riage. The old gentleman likewise opened his money bags as wide as his heart. He was very rich, and could vvell afford to do so ; the youth had quite sobered down after his late escapade, and there were no more wild pranks to be feared, and so, as the story-books say, \" they lived happy ever after.\" Far rocks on rocks, in mist and storm arrayed, Stretch far to sea their giant colonnade, And from their sable base, in sullen sound, In sheets of whitening foam the waves rebound. We can vvell believe there is many a sailor who will \" bless its useful light.\" It is somewhere in this far-off region of Ultima Thule that Goethe has placed the scene of that exquisite ballad from \" Faust,\" which Mr. Bayard Taylor has so exquisitely translated \u2014 There was a king in Thule, Was faithful till the grave, To whom his mistress, dying, A golden goblet gave.

With much blood was it foughten for many hours together, till Alpin, with great force giving a fresh charge on his ene mies, was unfortunately taken ; the Scots no sooner seeing their king taken, but they betake themselves to the mountains, so that the Picts that day remained victors, who took their prisoner, King Alpin, and beheaded him, leaving his body behind them, and carrying his head to the city of Camelon, where, in derision, they affixed it aloft on a pole in the middle of the city.\" Not a very creditable story for Dundee or for the Scots, especially if it be true that Alpin joined the army in person, when he saw the battle going against them, leading on the garrison of the castle as a forlorn hope ; surely they might have fought for his dead body to save it from ignominy, if they could not save him alive. people who only know7 of this large town (now the third in Scotland) as a centre of commer- cial activity, are apt to iook upon it as a kind of up start place, with little claim to interest other than of the trading sort. But it is far otherwise, and it is only to be regretted that \u2014 from some cause or other \u25a0 \u2014 so few tangible evidences of its an tiquity remain to us. Of its origin nothing definite is known. \"Some of our ancient historians,\" says Thomson, the historian of the town, \" indulging in their penchant for the marvellous, inform us that Dundee vvas a place of strength and importance at the time Agricola brought the Roman eagles into Scot land, and point it out as the place where Catanach, King of the Picts, entered into an agreement or league, offensive and defensive of course, with Galde \u2014 the Galgacus of the Latin historians \u2014 King ofthe Scots, against their common enemy, the Romans. They also inform us that their castle was strongly fortified, and the residence of Donald I. We, no more than the historians who record these things, know anything about them.\" After this statement we are somewhat amused to find Thomson drawing the inference, from very general premisses, that Dundee, in some form or other, did exist at this time. If, as some suppose, the place anciently called Alar turn vvas Dundee, then we begin to find historical trace of the place in 83 1, or a little later, when the battle of Pitalpin was fought between Alpin, King of the Scots, and Brude, King of the Picts. Of this battle Maule give* the following ac- Another early tradition regarding it links it on to the Crusades. David, Earl of Huntingdon, the brother of William the Lion, had taken part in the third of these Holy Wars, and on his homeward voyage vvas wrecked on the Egyptian coast, sold into slavery, and taken to Constantinople. Here he was found by some Englishmen, and, having been"], [380, "360 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. ance to the fugitive. But the Provost told Hepburn plainly that for his part he would gladly have assisted Alexander to find a ship, if he had known of his flight, and would have given him money too for his journey with the greatest pleasure.' ' If he had been my brother,' he added, ' I should long ago have delivered him from the miseries and dangers which he has been suffering at your hands.' \" This bold Provost was Sir James Scrimgeour of Dudhope. The incident gives us an in teresting glimpse into the state of opinion and feeling in the neighbour hood of St. Andrew's, at a period so closely succeeding the time of Hamil ton's (Patrick Hamilton, the reformer) teaching and martyrdom. Dundee had already among her traders and mer chants some citizens who were honoured by the suspicion of aiding and abetting fugitive heretics; and her provost and constable, a man of hereditary courage and spirit, was already so fearless a de fender of oppressed Lutherans, that he frankly told a mitred prior to his face how glad he would have been to baulk his persecuting zeal, and to disappoint his cruel designs. The Constable of Dundee vvas an important accession to the cause of the Reformation. The Scrimgeours of Angus, whose chief he was, were a numerous, wealthy, and powerful family, and were connected by marriage with several other great houses of the kingdom. In a royal charter of lS27> granted to Sir James, mention is made of \" the principal messuage, tower, and fortalice of his barony of Dudhope ;\" of \"his patronage of chaplainries within the burgh and town of Dundee belong ing to him by inheritance,\" and of many lands, his possessions, in the neighbour ing counties of Fife and Perth. To the interests of the Reformation in Dundee in particular, the support so early given to it by Sir James Scrimgeour was of the greatest consequence,_and g*oes f\\r to account for the prominent place whici ransomed, he returned to Scotland. He vvas almost shipwrecked once more on the coast of Norway, and vvas exposed to other \"perils of the sea; \" and in his dread plight he vowed that he would dedicate a church to the Virgin upon the spot on which he should land, if ever he did land at all. The sea grew quiet, and with a favourable wind he reached the coast under the shadow of Dundee Law, near which he built his promised Church of St. Mary, as a token of his gratitude. William, the king and his brother, made over Dundee to him, it now taking rank as a royal burgh. During the three succeeding centuries Dundee had a very unenviable position ; for it was a common resort of the coun try's enemies, and thus became very frequently the theatre of conflict. It vvas four times burned, the last occasion being under Edward VI. and at the in stance of Somerset, who was anxious to carry out at all hazards the betrothal of Edward to the Queen of Scots. With the rise of the Reformation, it entered upon a new phase of history, having been from an early period identified with the Protestant party \u2014 so much so that it came to be called the \" second Geneva.\" Out of this time one striking historical figure stands forth as a cham pion ofthe new faith \u2014 Sir James Scrim geour, of Dudhope, Constable of Dun dee. Of the part which this man \u2014 and Dundee through him \u2014 played in the great movement, the late Dr. Lorimer has given the following sketch : \u2014 \"When the horsemen who had been sent in pursuit of him returned to the Prior and reported [Alane's] escape, 'the Prior suspected,' says he [Alane], ' a citizen of Dundee to be the man who had pro vided me with a ship, and summoned him to appear before him in answer to the charge. The citizen appeared at St. Andrew's, accompanied by the Pro vost of Dundee, one ofthe knights ofthe kingdom, and was able to assure the Prior that he had given no such assist-"], [381, "\"BONNIE DUNDEE.\" 361 her citizens soon took in the great cause. was foolish enough to test his right to govern Dundee by attempting to assume the power of a magistrate. He made a new provost, and his choice was not only resented, but, as a consequence of it, Claverhouse, on the principle that \"discretion is the better part of valour,\" found it necessary to get off the ground as quickly as possible, which he did \u2014 minus his hat. Fired with rage at this humiliating defeat, he gathered his men together in the Glen of Ogilvy, and marched upon Dundee. As he was coming over the Sidlaw Hills, however \u2014 the range which forms as it were the background to Dundee \u2014 he vvas seen by a loyal lady of the neighbourhood, who sent a trusty servant to warn the citi zens of his approach. Claverhouse, on his arrival, found them forewarned and forearmed, and with wrath fanned by disappointment, he set his men to burn the Hilltown, known once as Rotten Row, and in a little while it vvas consumed to ashes. This doubtfully noble deed ofa so-called nobleman ended his relations with Dundee, the date of it being the Other notable men of Dundee stood forward on behalf of the new light, to whom we can only make a passing refe rence. James Hewat, a friar, the brothers Wedderburn, men notable in Scottish church history, who issued the famous '' Buik of Gude and Godly Ballates,\" and a translation of the Psalms; and Andrew Charters, characterised as \"a man of quick ingyne and goodly person age.\" But far more illustrious than any of these was George Wishart, one of the noblest martyrs of the Scottish Reforma tion. His connection with Dundee is such as to maintain his name in ever lasting remembrance. Hearing that the plague was devastating the town, he hastened to it to minister to the suffering and the dying; and one interesting re miniscence of his ministrations is that, standing at a spot where he could be heard both by those within and without the gates of the town, he preached from the text, \"He sent His word and healed them,\" and emphasized its truth in the homely comment, \"It is neither herb nor plaister, 0 Lord, but Thy word healeth all.\" Probably the testimony which was thus borne by Wishart to the beneficence of Divine law, and to the power and mercy of God, did as much to win the hearts of the people to the Pro- testant cause as did his eloquent plead- ings in controversy. 13th May, 16S9\u2014 just about five weeks before his defeat and death upon the battlefield of Killiecrankie. It was when Claverhouse vvas brood ing his dark schemes in this same Glen of Ogilvy that he made that journey to the Convention of Edinburgh which has been immortalised in a song which may very well come in here to vary thesc drier details of history : \u2014 Passing on from Reformation times, we come to speak ofa chapter in Dundee history associated with a name very diffe rent from anyof these, and vastly different from that of one already named who held the same office. This was John Graham of Claverhouse, whom James II. of Eng land made Constable of the town, and latterly Viscount of Dundee. \"These honours,\" says Thomson, \"were Gra ham's reward for years of cruel and dishonourable service toward his coun trymen, as the tool and minister of arbi trary power.\" It seems that Claverhouse To the Lords of Convention, 'twas Clavers who spoke, Ere the King's Crown go down, there are crowns to be broke, So each cavalier who loves honour and me, Let him follow the Bonnet of Bonnie Dundee.

Come, fill up, etc. We could not come to a place of sue'*-. importance as Dundee without telling a little of its history ; but we must let these two or three incidents in that his tory suffice to show that it has had its share, through many centuries, in the good and evil fortunes of the times, and that its story has been so far interwoven with that of those who, for good or for evil, formed, in various generations, a great part of the public life of Scotland. Let us now look at one or two of the relics of antiquity which Dundee pos sesses ; and then we will give an idea of it as it appears at the present day. First of all, we must say this with regard to the antiquities of Dun dee \u2014 that they are fewer than one might have expected, and it seems somehow as if the commercial mind which has dominated the place in mo dern times has not been so alive to the value of preserving these ancient things as we could have wished.

It was \"restored\" a few years ago according to the plans of Sir Gilbert Scott. The Dundee merchants were not likely to spare any cost when they once took the matter of \"restoration \" into their heads, and \u00a37,000 was spent upon the work. For ourselves we cannot say that the result inspires us with any measure of enthusiasm. It is heavy rather than massive, and, if we may be permitted to speak somewhat ritualistically, it does not symbolise any of those finer feelings which we associate with the House of God. Next we have Dudhope Castle \u2014 the seat, in olden times, of the Scrim geours, a family of which we have already spoken \u2014 a building dating from very early times, and associated, ni> The Gordon has asked of him whither he goes \u2014 Wheresoever shall guide me the soul of Montrose ; Your Grace in short space shall have tidings of me, Or that low lies the bonnet of Bonnie Dundee.

The ancient custom-house still stands, we believe, in the Greenmarket, and we may add that it has also attained to some small immortality in literature, through its prominent place in one of Grant's romances, \"The Yellow Frigate.\" This edifice stands in the Greenmarket. Then there is the East Port still remain ing to remind the modern Dundonian where the limit of his city vvas placed, in one direction at least, and \u2014 still more important \u2014 to mark the spot at which George Wishart stood and preached in that memorable year of the plague, 1544. But we do not pursue this subject of antiquities further ; it is too sad to think of the little that remains, and of the much that has been per mitted to vanish without almost a record or a trace left behind them. The ancient castle, the convents, the mint \u2014 all have gone ; and if we want to get at any outward and visible token of the days that have been, we are just as likely now7 to find it in the burying-ground of the \"Howff\" as anywhere else. This place contains many tombstones with curious epitaphs, but we can only in stance one or two. Here is one which tells the oft-repeated tale, how men, notable in their time, are laid to their grave amid the hopes of friends that their memory will flourish immortal in the hearts of men, and then are forgotten : \u2014 Ye tyme hath been In my zovth grene, That I vas elene Of bodie as ze ar ; But for my eyen, Nov tvo holes bene ; Of me is sene Bvt benes bare. This is surely grim enough, and, if written by a sorrowing friend, may probably suggest that a grief, which vvas so much at home in the details of the charnel-house, would probably not be very difficult to assuage. But, dear reader, if you should chance to visit Dundee, and wonder as to how your time is to be spent, we can hardly advise you to spend it seeking out the antique. St. Andrew's is near you, and so is Arbroath, and so is Brechin ; you had better betake yourself thither if such be your chief object of search. This has not been the forte of Dundee. It has, however, other elements of attraction. Nature has been very kind to it. Placed on a rising ground close to the Tay, it commands from its higher points a noble view \u2014 on the one hand up the river, on the other down to the sea. For our own part, we know few views that are finer than that which you have from a certain point in the Balgay Park. There, beneath you, is the busy and \u2014 in itself \u2014 not very picturesque town ; beside you are the spurs of the Sidlaw Hills; and, above all, above you lie the fair lands of the Carse of Gowrie bordering on the majestic river. Many a Scotchman will wander \" far frae hame,\" and yet see few views to com pare with this, which, most probably, he knows nothing about. And the beauty of the surroundings of Dundee has been enhanced by the two magnificent parks which the town possesses \u2014 the Balgay Park on the west, and the Baxter Park on the east. The latter vvas the munificent gift ofthe late Sir David Baxter and his sisters; it extends to thirty-five acres, and was laid out under the direction of Sir Joseph Paxton. 0 \" To his dearest brother, Thomas Milne, having ended his life well in the year ofthe Lord 1641, and of his age 22, Mr. Alexander Milne, minister of Forgan, placed this monument.

The town possesses several good modern buildings, the most notable being the High School, built in Grecian style; the Morgan Hospital, a noble building built in accordance with the bequest of Mr. John Morgan, a native of the town, by which about \u00a380,000 was left to build and endow it; and the Albert Institute, a memorial to the Prince Consort, a handsome building which serves a practical purpose as containing the museum and the library of the town. and it is manipulated on an enormous scale. In fact, the manufacture of flax, hemp, and jute fabrics constitutes the staple trade of the town, and supports, directly and indirectly, the great bulk of the inhabitants. There are upwards of seventy steam spinning-mills and power loom factories, employing above 50,000 persons. Some of these buildings are of great size and considerable architectural elegance, those of Messrs. Baxter, Messrs. Cox, and Messrs. Gilroy being especially conspicuous. These three afford em ployment to above 12,000 hands. The principal textile productions are osna burgs, dowlas, canvas, sheetings, bag ging, jute carpeting, etc., and the total value of these fabrics annually produced has been estimated at upwards of \u00a37,000,000. Among the other industries of Dundee may be mentioned ship building, engineering, tanning, and leather manufactures (including shoe making by machinery), all of which are conducted on a large scale. There are also considerable foundries, breweries, corn and flour mills, and confectionery and fruit-preserving works \u2014 Messrs. Keiller and Sons' 'Dundee marmalade' having a most extensive reputation. The prosperity of Dundee is, in a large measure, due to its commodious harbour and its magnificent docks. The harbour works extend about two miles along the riverside, and the docks, five in number, cover an area of thirty-five acres. Although they cannot compare in extent with those of London or Liverpool, they are probably unsurpassed in the king dom for stability and convenience. They have cost, from 1 8 1 5, when the works were begun, to May, 1877, \u00a3800,000; and the harbour revenue amounted in 1876 to \u00a350,751. The principal imports for the year ending May, 1876, were \u2014 flax, codilla, and hemp, 31,300 tons; jute, 106,727 tons; coals, 146,399 tons; timber, 46,256 loads ; whale and sea blubber, 1,694 tons; breadstuff's, 6,808 tons. The principal exports were \u2014 But, above all, Dundee is a business town, and as such it would probably choose mainly to be regarded. It has no fine streets, unless Reform-street be considered fine ; nor is there any part which could be called a gay thorough fare. It is simply a big place of busi ness ; and any stranger who should visit the Exchange about mid-day, or take a walk into the not very bright, but very busy, region of the Cowgate, would see the town in its most familiar aspect. We quote the following facts regarding it in this connection, from the interesting article \"Dundee,\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica : \u2014 \"Dundee is the chief seat of the linen manufacture in Britain, and from a very early time appears to have had a special reputation in this branch of industry. Hector Boece, a native of the town, in his History and Cronikles of Scotland, thus quaintly refers to it: \u2014 ' Dunde, the toun quhair we wer born ; quhair mony virtewus and lauborius pepill ar in, making of claith.' It was not, however, till the introduction of steam-power, in the beginning of the present century, that there was any remarkable develop ment of flax-spinning in Dundee. The first work of importance vvas the Bell Mill (which is still extant), built in 1S06, and the first power-loom factory was erected in 1836.

The first thirteen piers from the Fifeshire side could, it was found, be made to rest on the solid rock at a depth of from ten feet to fifteen feet below the bottom of the river. For each pier two cylinders of iron and brickwork. with a diameter of nine feet six inches, were built on shore, and connected; with a wall of brickwork three feet wide. The whole mass, weighing from 100 to 120 tons, was then floated out to the selected site, lowered to the bottom by hydraulic apparatus, and cleared of water. Workmen then descended and. excavated the material down to the rock, so that the cylinders gradually sank down to this point, when their interior was filled with concrete, and on the base thus secured, which reached just above low-water mark, the pier of solid brickwork was built up to high-water mark, when it received a course of Carmylice stone. When two piers had reached this stage the girders intended to rest on them were floated out and allowed to settle on them, and were subsequently lifted up by hydraulic appliances at the rate of two feet at a time, while the brickwork of the upper portions of the piers was constructed by men working on light scaffolds suspended from the girders. \"The Tay Bridge,\" said the Scotsman in its sketch of the opening of the bridge, \"was opened on Saturday, June 1, 1878, the actual work having commenced in 1S71, at a point about a mile and a-half above Newport. The engineer vvas Mr. Bouch, and the contractors Messrs. Hopkins, Gilkes & Co. At the place where operations were begun the river is nearly two miles wide, with a maxi mum depth at high water in spring tides of forty-five feet, and a velocity of cur rent as high at times as five knots per hour. The bridge consists of eighty five spans, varying in breadth from 67 to 245 feet. Of this latter width there are eleven spans, and two of 227, which cross the navigable portion of the river. Here the bridge has a height of 88 feet above high-water mark, from which it slopes down to the Fife side with a gradient of one in 356; and, towards the Dundee end, where it takes a curve to the eastward in order the more con veniently to join the land line, it has a gradient of one in 73. The spans are formed of wrought iron lattice girders, and the supporting piers, in some cases, \"After thirteen piers nad been built and the girders placed upon them in this manner, it was found that the rock suddenly shelved away to a great depth under beds of clay, gravel, and sand. To carry the foundations of the piers"], [387, "THE TAY BRIDGE. 367 down to the rock was therefore im practicable, and the method adopted was to construct for each pier a single oval cylinder twenty-three feet six inches, by thirteen feet six inches, to float it out to its site, blow away the sand from be neath it by means of a special apparatus invented by Mr. Reeves, one of the assistant engineers, and thus sink the cylinder till it reached the gravel about eighteen feet below the river bottom. Upon the cylinders, when filled with concrete, were placed hollow masses of brickwork, also built on shore and floated out, which, after being placed in position, were filled with concrete like the cylinders themselves. These carried the piers to low-water mark, whence brick-work vvas raised by ordi nary methods to high-water mark, when four courses of Carmylice stone were introduced, and on them the super structure of the piers was placed in the form of iron columns of twelve inches and fifteen inches diameter. Fourteen piers, constructed in this manner, brought the bridge to the navigable channel. Here it was necessary to provide piers of greater strength, to support the vastly increased weight of the superincum bent girders, which at this point have a span of 245 feet, and weigh 190 tons each. The cylinders employed for the foundation were now made round, with a diameter of thirty-one feet, and on them hexagonal masses of brickwork, twenty-seven feet by sixteen feet, were carried up to high-water mark. From this point each pier was composed of six iron columns, constructed in ten-feet lengths, and of eighteen inches and fifteen inches diameter, securely bolted together, and made fast to each other by strong vertical and diagonal braces. Thirteen piers of this kind carry the bridge over the navigable channel, and beyond this the method of construction was reverted to, except that the double cylinders for the foundation were of greater diameter\u2014 fifteen feet instead of nine feet six inches. The upper part of the piers also at this end of the bridge consisted of iron columns, and in the curved portion of the bridge, where it nears the north shore, a different ar rangement of the columns vvas resorted to, and a series of stays put down on the west side to resist the outward thrust of trains going round the curve. The girders which span the spaces between the piers, and on which the roadway of the bridge is laid, vary in depth from twenty-seven feet in the great central ones, to twelve feet in those nearer the shore on both sides. In adjusting them, provision, vvas made for expansion by heat, which it vvas estimated would, over the whole length of the bridge, amount to as much as seven feet. The external lightness and airiness of the structure, in spite of the immense weight of iron and brickwork employed in it, is re markable, and is one important element ot its security, inasmuch as the bridge will offer a far smaller resisting surface than a tubular one, for example, would have done to the furious blasts of wind which in boisterous weather sweep down on the valley of the Tay. . . . The width of the surface upon which the rails are laid is fifteen feet. The rails themselves rest on substantial sleepers of creosoted timber, and the rest of the roadway is covered with planking- coated with asphalte. To diminish the possibilities of accident from trains getting off the rails, each rail is furnished with a guard. \"The work of constructing the bridge vvas first contracted for and taken in hand by Messrs. De Bergue & Co., of London, but on the death of the senior partner of that firm in May, 1S74, the contract was transferred to Messrs. Hopkins, Gilkes & Co., of Middles borough, by whom it was completed. On the whole the progress of the opera tions was delayed by few accidents. The most serious mishap occurred in August, 1S73, when the upper part of a cylinder which vvas being sunk, as al-"], [388, "368 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. ready explained, through the river bottom to the rock by men working inside, burst, and the water rushing in, drowned six workmen. During a violent gale in February of 1877 two of the largest girders, which had been raised to the top of the piers prepared for them, but had not been put in their places, were blown down from the hanging gear; but this occurrence, whilst it in volved some loss of time and money, furnished satisfactory evidence of the stability of those parts of the bridge which were already finished. The exact length of the bridge is 3,450 yards\" (almost exactly two miles). the bridge, handed the stoker the baton, without which no train was allowed to cross. At this time the gale was blow- ing with such violence that it was with great difficulty that Barclay regained his cabin. Along with him in the cabin was a surfaceman named Watt, who expressed great doubt as to the security of the bridge. Together, accordingly, the men watched the train as it passed along at the usual rate of three miles an hour. The moon vvas shining brightly, although the wind vvas blowing a fear- ful hurricane, the white-crested waves in the Forth and the damage caused on shore testifying to its violence. The lookers-on continued to watch the pro- gress of the train, all the lights being distinctly visible until the locomotive entered between the high girders in the centre of the bridge. ... It vvas just after the train had passed from the upper to the lower line of metals, between the high girders in the centre of the river, that a fearful blast, with a roar resembling a continuous roll ot thunder, swept down the river. Some of the spectators state that at that moment an intensely brilliant sheet of flame and a shower of sparks were seen at the high girders, caused by the frac- tured iron as the massive structure broke and fell into the seething waters of the Tay. The signalman and his companion at the Fife end of the bridge did not see so much. From their position, on the level of the rails and looking along the line, the red lights at the rear of the train were clearly seen for a considerable time, until the men calculated the engine must have cleared the high girders forming the central part of the bridge. Then the lights suddenly disappeared. Barclay thought the train had rounded the curve, but Watt vvas apprehensive that the bridge had given way, and on Barclay proceeding to the telegraph instrument the dread suspicion was too fully con firmed.\" Thus hopefully did people write at the time of the completion of the great undertaking, and Dundee was for the time full of enthusiasm. It seemed as if now at last its long-lived ambition for a distinct pre-eminence over Perth on the one side, and Aberdeen on the other, would be finally secured; and many who cared little for these things, were at least happy to think that they would be able to make their way to Edinburgh through Fife without the often intoler able inconvenience' of the steamer-pas sage between Broughty Ferry and Tayport. But all these bright hopes were destined \u2014 for a time at least \u2014 to be speedily blasted. One tremendous storm wrought the dreadful havoc. \"The train from Edinburgh to Dun- dee,\" writes a journalist of the time, \"consisted of four third-class carriages, one first-class carriage, one second- class carriage, guard's brake, and engine. It left Edinburgh on Sunday afternoon at 4.15, stopping, as is usual with many Sunday trains, at nearly all the wayside stations. On arrival at St. Fort, the last station before reachino- the Tay Bridge, the train vvas found to be five minutes late. Here the tickets were collected, and at thirteen minutes past seven o'clock, according to the usual custom, the signalman, Thomas Barclay, stationed at the south end of"], [389, "THE TAY BRIDGE. 369 We summarise the remainder of the account. The telegraph would not work : and the men, now greatly alarmed, first tried to walk across the bridge, but were effectually prevented by the force ofthe gale. They then walked along the shore, and there saw, under a sudden gleam of moonlight, the dread ful gap in the bridge. They hurried to the Tay Bridge station, and endeavoured now to signal, but the signal brought no response, and its silence seemed sym bolic of the sad truth. Upon the Dun dee side people had by this time gathered in great alarm, and shortly before eleven a steamer was sent out to see what could be discovered, but what with strong current and strong wind it was only when it got close under the bridge that anything could be seen. \"Then it became painfully evident that the whole centre of the bridge had dis appeared, the line of foam between the piers marking where the wreckage lay, and where, probably, many of the un- fortunate passengers were lying in death. The steamer returned to shore, gentlemen on board, visited the scene of the disaster. The harbour diver vvas also on board, and his apparatus vvas fixed to a barge, which was towed be hind the steamer. When the vessel reached the bridge, a boat which had been put off by Captain Scott from the Mars, came alongside with sounding lead and long poles, and the depth of the water around the scene and the gaps between was sounded, but no bodies were found, and no traces of the sunken train were visible.\" The diver, who went down at two places, found the girders lying, but saw no trace of the train ; and the boat returned, having accomplished but little. In the course of some days pieces of broken carriages were at last found, and the bodies of the dead passengers drifted at length to the shore. We cannot say much more concern ing this frightful tale of sorrow. One thing we are glad to add \u2014 that, whilst at first amid the wild calculations of panic some hundreds of lives were sup posed to have been lost, it vvas found that the train had been a comparatively light one ; and, dire as the number of bereavements vvas, it vvas not so terrible as had been thought. and soon, the melancholy news being made fully known, the wildest excitement prevailed.

We can remember some sunset hours in full view of that scene as among the most delightful hours we have spent in the study of Nature's beauty. More to the westward you see Dundee, somewhat grim and very smoky, its smoke losing itself in the blue heaven which smiles even through these clouds upon the dull routine life of commerce, and covers even it in true hearts with a heavenly beauty. And \" back of\" Dundee is the \"Law,\" the \"Primrose Hill\" of London on a larger scale, while further away, girding the horizon, are the Sidlaws, whispering that the vast range of the Grampians is not far off and sometimes tempting the merchant, weary of his ledger and his counting-house, away to that delightsome land which seems as he thus looks upon it, or at least dreams of it, to be so very near. quite away from this part of the world, let us take a look at Broughty Ferry, which is now more a suburb of Dundee than either a distinct burgh or a no table fishing village. Broughty Ferry lies nominally about three-and-a-half miles to the east of Dundee on the coast, but the houses in reality almost join ; and it is only, perhaps, at such times as a Parliamentary election, when its householders find themselves outside the bustle of a keen local contest, that the separation of the two places is quite realised. A beautiful place is this Broughty Ferry, and we do not wonder lhat the merchants of the busy town should choose it as a place of residence. Lying just at the mouth of the Tay, it commands both a sea and a river view, and we know few prospects more line than that to be seen from Fort Hill or Reres Hill, on a summer evening. Eastwards you look towards the old Panmure lands (now, alas, beginning to look somewhat smoky as they are catch ing more and more the infection of the town's bustle) and towards the German Ocean, and you descry, perhaps, in the distance a stream of smoke coming from \u2022some passing steamer, which carries your thoughts away into the busy world which lies beyond that \"tight little island,\" which seems like all the world to us. Right across the Tay river is situated the not very picturesque vil lage of Tayport; but !>o soon as you lurn your eyes to the south-west you have the Tay with its majestic sweep before you, and if the day be very clear, you can trace it as far as the pretty little For those who love the sea-shore Broughty Ferry presents much attrac tion ; for it possesses a splendid beach, and now, moreover, has something of a marine promenade, not very ambitious in its style indeed, but enough to give the place somewhat more of that gay air which\u2014 dare we say it ?\u2014 it is appa rently anxious to possess. For the antiquarian the place has also some interest, though it must be owned not very much, through its being in pos session of a castle. Broughty Castle has never been very important in history. Built by Lord Gray about 1490, it was taken in the following century by that ravager of Scotland, the Protector Somerset, who garrisoned it. First the Earl of Arran, and then the Earl of Argyle laid siege to it, but neither of them succeeded. At length, however, help came from over the"], [391, "ARBROATH AND ITS ABBEY. 371 water. France and Germany sent auxiliaries to the number of six thousand, and these again were reinforced by 1,000 foot and 3,000 horse. The siege was raised, February 20, 1550; the fortress vvas bereft of its strength ; and the castle of Broughty relapsed into obscurity. Within our own time it has been \"restored,\" with the not uncom mon result that its olden, rugged, ruinous beauty has been taken away, and now it stands a somewhat heavy-looking, and rather meaningless tower upon the sands of Broughty, as it were lifting up a sombre and prosaic testimony against its restoration. with human figures. Men whose days are mostly spent in the work of the office, and who sit most of their other days, may be here seen running to and fro after their balls, and sometimes in their excitement perhaps flourishing their golf-clubs as if they were shillelaghs. And speakingof such awarlike weapon as the latter, we are reminded that as we proceed along the Links, we find our selves at a spot which marks an ancient battle. For the old Danish soldier, Camus, in the ninth century, found his way to Carnoustie, and there met Malcolm the Second in battle array. After a bloody conflict, the Scottish army won the day, and Camus vvas him self killed, as were many of his people. At the village of Cainustown stands an obelisk, bearing the name of Camus Cross, and supposed to mark the spot to which Camus fled from the battlefield, and at which he vvas overtaken and slain. The battle is named variously the \"Battle of Barry,\" and the \"Battle of Panbride,\" and perhaps, if we may make a compromise and say that it vvas fought at.Carnoustie, we shall not be far from the mark. Wandering from Broughty Ferry, with its merchants on the hill, its shop keepers in the middle, and its fisher men on the seaboard \u2014 a kind of typical arrangement, by the way \u2014 we find ourselves on the \" Links \" or downs which stretch by way of Monifieth and Barry pretty vvell onwards toward Arbroath. On these delightful downs by the sea the ancient and pleasant game of golf is played, and on a fine Saturday afternoon you may see them \u2014 not indeed crowded, but studded Arbroath and its Abbey. \u25a0VING along the ;oast, Arbroath is the next place which claims Dur attention, alike from its ancient Abbey and from the grandeur of the rugged seaboard which it can boast. As a modern town it does not demand from us very much atten tion. Enough to say that carries on considerable manufactures, and that it has a harbour. Anciently, however, and under its name of Aber brothock, it can claim a considerable place in history, ecclesiastical and civil. Its Abbey vvas founded by William the Lion about the year 117S, and dedi cated to the memory of Thomas a Bec ket, who had been his friend during his residence in England, and whose memory he greatly revered. It is re marked as a rare thing, this dedication of an abbey to one so recently dead (Thomas had been killed in 1 170), and it has a number of good shops, that it"], [392, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 372 of course still more recently canonised. And it may be taken as an interesting evidence of the remarkable influence of this remarkable man, that a stranger should have been so attracted by him as to dedicate this great house to his name, whilst his contemporaries were seeking amongst catalogues of saints of remote antiquity for patrons to their churches and their abbeys.* The Scottish court was often held in this place, we learn, both in the time of William and in suc- ceeding reigns, and the body of the founder vvas buried under the high altar of the Abbey. \"All the prelates and nobles of the kingdom,\" we are told, \"attended his corpse from Stirling to Arbroath ; spent there fourteen days in mourning for him, and in devotional exercises appropriate to the occasion ; and ordained, ere they parted, that for a year to come no feasts should be made, and no plays performed in any part of the kingdom.\" In 1320 a memorable event took place in this building, for here King Robert the Bruce held that great Parliament in which Scotland's in- dependence was asserted, and amidst much trembling the Pope himself was remonstrated with. It would seem that Edward II. , not very fortunate in his military attempts against the Scottish people, as Bannockbum field can testify, had had recourse to the Church, and, bestowing his money freely, gained over Pope John \u00a3 XXII. to his side. The result was a Papal order that j there should be a truce of two years between the countries, the sovereignty of Bruce being conspicuously ignored. Angry communications followed, and Bruce standing firm by his claim, he and his adherents were excommuni- cated : whereupon followed this great Parliament and its remonstrance. Said they, \"Our most holy fathers, your pre decessors, did with many great and sin gular favours and privileges fence and secure this kingdom, as being the peculiar charge and care of the brother of St. Peter.\" Then they proceeded to tell how Edward I. had deceived them with fair offers of friendship, and had brought upon them \"injuries, blood, and violence,\" and \"a vast multitude of bar- barities.\" Then came their unflinching expression of loyalty tothe ignored Bruce. \"But at length it pleased God, who only- can heal after wounds, to restore us to libertiefromtheseinnumerablecalamities, by Our Most Serene Prince, King, and Lord, Robert, whofor the delivering ofhispeople, and his own rightful inheritance from the enemies' hand, did, like another Joshua or Maccab\u00e6us, most cheerfully undergo all manner of toil, fatigue, hard- ship, and hazard. The Divine Provi- dence, the right of succession by the laws and customs of the kingdom (which we will defend till death), and the due and lawful consent and assent of all the people, made him our king and prince To him we are obliged and resolved to adhere in all things.\" Having thus plainly put their view of things, without much evidence of pliability, they pro- ceeded then, \" with bended knees and hearts,\" to beseech the Pope that he would order the English king to let them live in peace. Surely they must have got off their knees again, these sturdy old nobles, when they proceeded to tell the Holy Father that it vvas his own \"con- cernment\" to look to this matter, and told him besides that if he listened any more to English misrepresentations, all their calamities would be laid to his charge. The document wound up, as in duty bound, with a prayer that this holy man might long be spared to the Church. A very interesting document this, making it vvell worth our while to stand by the remains of this old Abbey from which it issued; a fine, and truly Scottish blending of dutiful phrase with stiff, inflexible de- termination, typical of the Scotchman who is very good at acknowledging authority with perfect sincerity, and with equal sincerity \"sticking\" to his point.

Above this window is another, a mere circular hole, which, standing at so great a height as to be seen far out at sea, has always been vvell known by sailors, and has received the name of the \"round O of Arbroath.\" The remonstrance did its work, and Edward was bidden to be quiet. Of this Abbey, which marks so inte resting a scene, we may here give some little description of a more detailed character. A word or two about the \"chapter house,\" as it is called, which still remains attached to the south wall of the nave. It is chiefly interesting now as containing some valuable relics of a by-gone time, which were brought out of the rubbish turned up in the restoration of 1815-16. Of one of these Mr. Jervise, in his \"Memorials of Angus and Mearns,\" speaks as follows: \u2014 \"The most inte resting [of the relics] is, perhaps, the fragment of a recumbent effigy in a dark spotted kind of marble, called mad repore. Although the head is gone, and the figure otherwise mutilated, there is a grace and elegance in the disposition and folds of the drapery, and a truthful ness in the remaining details of the lion at the feet, that indicates the chisel of no mean sculptor. All history agrees that William the Lion, the founder of the Abbey, vvas buried before its high altar (ante majus altare, says Fordun), on the 4th of December, 1214; and from the fact of this effigy having been found in the chancel of the church, immediately in front of the supposed site of the high altar, and covering a stone coffin in which were the bones of a person of goodly stature, the grave and statue were presumed to be those of King William. Apart from the figure of the animal at the feet . . . a pouch or purse is suspended from a belt on the left side which begirts the waist, and fragments of four armed Liliputian knights, with spurs on their boots, are on various parts of the figure, as if in the act of arranging or adjusting the dress.\" The building vvas very large, and is supposed to have contained a great part of the area in later times covered by the town; one account gives the area as 1,150 feet in length from north to south, by 706 feet in breadth at the north end, and 484 at the south. The church of the Abbey was 269 feet long, the nave and side-aisles being 65 feet broad, and about 67 feet in height. A tower stands at the north-west corner, about 70 feet in height, which used formerly to be the \"Regality prison.\" Of the building it self little remains now save portions of the nave and choir, the east and west ends, and the south transept. In style the Abbey belonged for the most part to the Early English or First-pointed style of Gothic architecture; and the remains are such as to show that the original edifice vvas alike picturesque and mag nificent. The hand of Time, and the rougher hand of man, have not sufficed to efface its beauty. It is one of the shameful stories of modern Vandalism\u2014 a Vandalism, we fear, in which Scotland has had quite its share\u2014 that the cor poration of Arbroath used actually to sell portions of it for building materials! The eastern window must be specially mentioned. Still remaining to cast its light upon what vvas once the high altar, one cannot refrain from dreaming of early masses said under that light long ago, while the sound of the great ocean heaving away yonder outside sent its voice into the ear of the officiating priest; and of prayers poured out of sincere hearts, when \"the sea roared and the fulness thereof for brave sailors breasting the billows, or for widows left lone and desolate till the Another of the statues has been thought by some to be that of Thomas a Becket ; it represents some one in an"], [394, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 374 attitude of prayer\u2014an ecclesiastic pro bably, from the nature of the robes in which he is decked.

With the small train of attendants and friends who accompanied him, he rejoined the forces of Inverqu- harity, and, proceeding to the town of Arbroath, found the opposite party drawn up in great strength on the outside of the gates. The families thus opposed in mortal defiance to each other could number among their adherents many of the bravest and most opulent gentlemen in the country, and the two armies exhibited an imposing appearance of armed knights, barbed horses, and embroidered banners. As the com- batants, however, approached each other, the Earl of Crawford, who had received information of the intended combat, being anxious to avert it, suddenly ap- peared on the field, and, galloping up between the two lines, was mortally wounded by a soldier, who was enraged at his interference, and ignorant of his rank. The event naturally increased the bitterness of hostility, and the Crawfords, who were assisted by a large party of the vassals of Douglas, infuriated at the loss of their chief, attacked the Ogilvys with a desperation which soon broke their ranks, and reduced them to irreclaimable disorder. Such, however, was the gallantry of their resistance, that they were almost entirely cut to pieces ; and five hundred men, including many noble barons in Forfar and Angus, were left dead upon the field. Seton himself had nearly paid with his life the penalty of his adherence to the rude usages of the times ; and John Forbes of Pitsligo, one of his followers, was slain ; nor was the loss which the Ogilvys sustained in the field their worst misfortune ; for Lindsay, with his characteristic ferocity, and pro- tected by the authority of Douglas, let loose his army on their estates; and the flames of their castles, the slaughter of their vassals, theplunderof theirproperty, and the captivity of their wives and We cannot, however, linger any longer about this old Abbey; and if our readers would desire more minute par ticulars regarding it, as our purpose is not after all that of a guide, he must betake himself to his \"Murray\" or his \"Black.\" Forourselvesthe details are less than the grand old Abbey itself, which stands there a noble monument, even in ruin, of times that are long dead, and especially ofthe unbending independence which -marked the Scottish people long centuries ago, and we think marks them now. We have still to tel! the reader of a Battle of Arbroath, which also marks it out from common towns. It took place in January, 1446, and the contending parties were two powerful families of the neighbourhood, the Lindsays and the Ogilvys. Alexander Ogilvy of Inver quharity had been chosen \"chief Justiciar\" by the Chapter of the Abbey, in succession to the Master of Crawford, better known afterwards as the \"Tiger Earl,\" and \"Earl Beardie,\" who vvas, of course, a Lindsay. The latter resented his being superseded, while Ogilvy stood by his appointment; and over^his small matter the battle arose. \"There can be little doubt,\" says Tytler, \"that the Ogilvys must have sunk under this threatened attack, but that accident gave them a powerful ally in Sir Alexander Seton of Gordon, after wards Earl of Huntly, who, as he re turned from Court, happened to lodge for the night at the Castle of Ogilvy, &at the moment when this baron was mus tering his forces against the meditated assault of Crawford.

His son, Lord Ogilvy, thought it useless to attempt to stand against such an enemy, and he accordingly fled. No family was likely to receive less consideration from the Covenanters than that of Airlie, for it had stood very steadfastly to the royal cause in all vicissitudes; and it may be, as Dr. Marshall says in his \"Historic Scenes of Forfarshire,\" that there was also some private feud to account for the vengeance wrought upon the\u201e \"house o' Airly.\" ..

Some will have it that it was a chief seat of the Druidic worship in the North; and a high autho rity thinks he finds traces ofthe presence of the Druids in the name of three farms close to the town \u2014 Pittendreich \u2014 which he holds to be a corruption of Pit-an donach, the \" Grave of the Druids.\" At a later day, the Culdees took possession of the town, and it may be necessary to explain in a sentence or so who these were. They were missionaries of the Cross, who came from Ireland to evan gelise Britain in the sixth century along with Columba, and who, choosing Iona for their centre, spread throughout the country preaching the Gospel of Christ. In many places colleges were estab lished, to be themselves local centres for missionary labour, and one of these centres vvas Brechin. The Culdees, be it understood, represented altogether a far more pure type of Christianity than the Roman Catholics; and when, by and-by, the latter also spread in Scot land, not as allies, but antagonists, of the Culdees. \"The Church of Rome,\" re marks Dr. Marshall, \" hated the Cul dees. They did not partake with it in many of its abominations, but witnessed against them. They held fast by the Word of God as the only infallible standard and rule in matters of religion. They rejected transubstantiation, the worship of saints and images, purgatory and prayers for the dead, the infalli bility of the Pope, the doctrine of the merit of good works, and other Romish tenets. The consequence vvas, that as Romanism grew strong, it persecuted Culdeeism, setting itself to extirpate it; .E are reluctantly ' compelled to pass ' over many places of interest at this stage of our work ; ourspace is limited, and we must move Thus we cannot say anything of Montrose ; nor of the beautiful castle of Kinnaird ; nor of Craig, with its reminiscences of the pious Andrew Melville. Brechin, however, is too important a spot to be passed over ; indeed, it might perhaps be said that no town in the county ought to draw more upon our interest than Brechin. So old is it that it is mentioned as having been a \"great city\" as long ago as the year 990, and though it can .not now be called a \" great city,\" being but a small place, it may be said that it i.j> still a pushing and active town, having large linen factories which enjoy a great measure of prosperity. And, were not Brechin a town remarkable for activity, it would be more marked out than it is for the beauty of its situation, as it lies there on the banks of the Esk. Being off the main line of railway, it is rather out of the stream of modern life, and hence it may be that you find in it more of the characteristics of an ancient ecclesiastical town, despite its modern factories. As you saunter through it, and listen to the quaint old-world Scotch tongue of the workpeople, you dream yourself back into the old days when the Cathedral vvas a cathedral indeed.

Such an isolated rock presented a fit site for the worship of the Druids; and the dells around may then have been clad, as some of them still are clothed, with umbrageous trees, the castle and town of Brechin being, in the time of the Druids, both alike unknown. Whether such a suc- cession of religious orders did or did not occur on the little mount which for ages has been the burying-place of the inhabitants of Brechin, it is impossible positively to say ; but there is nothing in the supposition inconsistent with what has occurred amongst other nations which have undergone changes in their religious dynasties \u2014 the newly estab lished order having generally selected the places of worship of the expelled party for the site of the new churches or altars.\" But there are yet unmistakable traces of them about the city. The gardens on the west side of the present Parish Church, and belonging to the Kirk Session, are called the College Yards, and who can doubt that they were in days of yore the Yards of the Culdee College hard by ? The well in these gardens, yielding remarkably pure and sweet w7ater, is called the College Well, and who can doubt that it was the vvell of the Culdee College? There is a wynd called the College Wynd, and who can doubt the origin and the historic import of such a name ? \" Thus, then, there was a succession of faiths represented in this ancient town in the early centuries, and we are not without some hints of continuity in the locale of the worship. We read of a monastery built in the time of Malcolm II., which is supposed to have been Cul- dee, and it is thought that the cathedral was built upon its site; upon this same spot Presbyterians now worship ; and if we can stretch our imaginations so far as to conceive of the Druids having worshipped on the site, we shall have a marvellous local history of a people's worship. Mr. Black, author of a history ofthe city, has dwelt upon this thought with natural delight. He says : \u2014 \" With- out much stretch of the imagination we can conceive that the site of the present Presbyterian Church of Brechin vvas the place of worship successively of Druids, Culdees, Romanists, Episcopalians, and Presbyterians. Nor is there anything in the situation ofthe church of Brechin opposed to the idea that it was originally a Druidical temple. The church stands on a sandstone rock, the sides of which are precipitous on the south and east; and while the western side slopes more gently, the northern side appears to Symbolically at least this is true, that Brechin has marked in miniature by its history the religious history of Scotland. Of this the old cathedral is itself the expression: and of it we must now come to speak more especially. Dedi cated to St. Ninian, it stands upon a picturesque spot, just overlooking from the north side a very steep ravine, be yond which lies the demesne of Brechin Castle. With its eye thus alike upon town and castle, its very position may be said to indicate the fact that it vvas designed to be a meeting-place for rich and poor, where high-born lord and lowly retainer might alike bow before the Majesty on high. Its style vvas Gothic, but long ago these excellent people of modern times, the \"restorers,\" to whom we have often had to make particular reference, did their best to mar its beauty. Much has been said and written against the iconoclastic tendencies of the Reformers; but better a thousand times pull down a roof here and there, and leave a grand ruin be-"], [402, "382 PIC TURE SQ UE SCO TLAND. hind, than improve upon the immortal genius of the ancient builder by your modern patchwork of \" restoration.\" The north and south transepts were re moved ; there was one roof spread over nave and aisle; no matter if grand windows were spoiled, or cornices which might have delighted the eye for cen turies, practically cleared aw7ay. We do not wonder that a writer, dwelling upon the change, says in anger: \u2014 \"In stead, therefore, of an elegant Gothic fabric, it wears all the appearance of a huge ugly barn, loaded with a quarry of slates ! \" One fine window, however, still remains over the west door, which is regarded as peculiarly artistic in mullions and tracery. One of the main features of interest about the edifice is the \" Round Tower,\" concerning which much has been said and written, and about which, we suppose, every man has his theory. There is only one other such in Scotland \u2014 the Round Tower of Abernethy : whilst in Ireland there are many ; and it has been supposed, there fore, that the style is Irish. The tower is built of freestone, and is nearly ioo feet high, if we include the small modern spireat thetop. At the baseit measures \u2014 outside \u2014 sixteen feet in diameter, while inside it measures only eight feet. Over the doorway is a rough representation of the Crucifixion, and this, with the fact that the architectural ornaments are Christian, has seemed to point to the conclusion that the tower vvas built in Christian times. Others trace its history farther back, and consider that it was a watch-tower of the Picts, and that the Christian symbols which are carved upon it were added afterwards. said that the bishop, a man of courage and firmness, took a pair of pistols into the church with him, and so was pre pared to defend himself against any interference with the order of service. Truly a militant priest! A word here about another ancient religious house in Brechin, the Maison Dicu, now gone, but leaving its record in the name, \" Maisondieu Lane.\" This house seems to have been founded about the middle of the thirteenth cen tury by William de Brechin, who had been made by Royal favour \" Lord of Brechin ; \" and in more modern times it was devoted, in connection with the church, to the cause of education. The chaplain vvas charged with the training of the youth of the district in grammar, and vvas appointed \" to exercise the place and charge ofa master of the grammar school within the samyne.\" Thus in recent times the old \" house of God \" came to be not unfitly a school, and \u2014 let us add \u2014 a school of no mean fame. The building, however, ceased by-and by to be used for this purpose, though its revenues still continued to be used in the same way; the \"Maison Dieu \" be came a slaughter-house or a stable \u2014 we know not which, nor are we careful to inquire. A fire happily put an end to this humiliating, if not disgraceful, change. Brechin Castle, though in its present form not to be called ancient, is yet the representative of the old castle which was standing in the days of Henry de Brechin, nephew of William the Lion. In that fortress a scene very humbling to Scottish pride was enacted in the year 1296; for there Baliol ac knowledged \" the justice of the English invasion andconquest,\" and resigned \"his kingdom, its people, and their homage. into the hands of his liege lord,\" Edward I.

It is"], [403, "BRECHIN. 383 Scotland; and he seems to have had nothing but unhindered prosperity wher ever he went, until he came to Brechin. The memory of the humiliation through which he had brought the country in that fortress seven years before, doubt less confirmed the determination of its garrison to maintain it to the death against him. The hero of the defence was Sir Thomas Maule, an ancestor of that house \u2014 noble still, not in name only, but in character \u2014 the house of Dalhousie. Edward's force w7as large, Maule's insignificantly small ; but the latter held out for twenty days, and history tells how they used to go on the ramparts with handkerchiefs to wipe off the dust raised by the enemy's firing. At last an ill fated shot from the \"War Wolf\" \u2014 a powerful engine which the English army possessed \u2014 struck down Sir Thomas, as he stood \u2014 it is supposed \u2014 upon the bastion on the south-east corner of the Castle. As he was dying, his men came about him to ask if they .should surrender; but his dying words bade them maintain their defence. With the death of their leader, however, their enthusiasm died, and on the follow ing day they surrendered. which separated the castle from the town, through which the Skinner's burn still runs. The Esk formed the southern defence ; and, as represented in Captain Slezer's view, there vvas a ditch on the west, whether natural or artificial can not now be said. The river has en croached considerably upon the rock on which the castle stands (as at one time there was a cart-road along the base of it, which extended in the form of a foot path down to within these eighty years). Probably the western fosse had been, filled up by the forfeited Earl, who, in 1 7 1 1 , made large additions to the house, and gave it a new front, upon which are fine carvings of the Vallognes and Maule arms. The latter are upon a separate shield, quartered with those of the ducal house of Hamilton, the for feited Earl having married Margaret, third daughter of the fourth Duke of that title. The castle was still further enlarged by the late Lord Panmure near the close of last century ; and, since his death, under the direction of his second son, the late Colonel Lauderdale Maule, both the interior and exterior were much improved.\" In modern times Brechin has not figured largely in history, yet it has had its share in the march of events. A \" Battle of Brechin \" vvas fought in 1570, during the feuds between the party of Queen Mary and that of her infant son. In 1647-8, the town vvas visited by the plague, and, in four months, six hun dred persons are said to have died from it. In 1672 it vvas burned down. Throughout the troublous years of the latter part of Charles I.'s reign and of the Commonwealth, it vvas kept in frequent turmoil, from the quartering of contending parties in the town, stand ing as it did just between the Highlands. and the Lowlands, and being the key to the one bridge which at this time the South Esk boasted. It does not seem that thetow7n vvas much pleased by these con stantly-recurring visits. \" The burgh,\" \" Maule,\" says Matthew of West minster, \"was a soldier of undaunted boldness and resolution of mind ; the \\ igour and strength of his body vvas very great, and he did not fear to hold out the small fortress committed to his charge against a royal enemy.\" The change which has passed over the appearance and position of Brechin Castle since those old days have been thus succinctly sketched by Mr. Jervise, a well-known antiquarian historian of \" Angus and the Mearns \" : \u2014 \" The most ancient fortress of Brechin had occupied much the same romantic spot as the present castle, which stands upon a rock, about eighty feet in height, over hanging the South Esk. It vvas sur rounded by water in old times, and on t.ie north and east vvas a natural fosse,"], [404, "384 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. says Mr. Black, \"was much annoyed by this distinction which rendered it an ob ject to both parties. For several weeks in the end of August and during the months of September and October, 165 1, there was no ' sermon, collection, or ses sion, by reason both the ministers were absent, the English forces lying in garrison round about this town, and a garrison in the Castle of Brechin,' as the kirk records bear ; and they further in form us, that on 2nd July, 165 1, there was 'no session, neither sermon this Wednesday, by reason all within this burgh was called to go to Aberbrothock to assist them against the pursuing enemy by sea;' although in w7hat manner the landsmen of Brechin were so to assist is not explained.

Not to speak ofthe noble men who have owned the name of Maule, and held the ancient castle, there have been such men as Thomas Dempster, an eminent scholar of the seventeenth century who filled a professor's chair successively in Paris, in Nismes, in Pisa, and in Boulogne, in which last town he died in 1625. He wrote an Ecclesiastical History of Scot- land in nineteen books. Maitland, author of the old histories of London and of Edinburgh; Guthrie, editor of the once very famous \" Geographical Grammar;\" Professor Nichol of Aber- deen, famous as an astronomer; and the genial, eloquent, and large-hearted Dr. Thomas Guthrie, whose name and memory are still fresh among- us : \u2014 all these were notable sons of the ancient \" City \" of Brechin.

It is not known when or in what cir cumstances it was built; but the story of its sudden demolition is well known. \" One fine summer's day,\" says the local historian, \"when Carnegy vvas from home, his lady had the table spread with the choicest viands awaiting his arrival, and, accompanied by her lapdog, she went along the avenue to meet him ; but just as the laird ap proached the gate, the walls of that part of the house where the table vvas spread burst in twain, and falling to the ground, threw everything into utter ruin. The event was long supposed to be unaccountable, and, as a matter of course, attributed to supernatural causes; but on the rubbish being cleared away, the catastrophe vvas found to have arisen from a ground- slip, caused by the inun dation of the Lemno. Apart from the miraculous escape of the lady, it is said that no lives were lost save that of her favourite dog, who, being attracted to the spot by the noise, was buried among the ruins.\" Upon the south-east wall there is \u2014 or was \u2014 an iron hook upon which \"Earl Beardie,\" of whom we have already had occasion to speak, used to hang up delinquents. And a story is on record of a poor wandering minstrel who was hung upon it because he foretold the murder of Douglas, and Beardie's own defeat at Brechin. Lady Crawford had heard him, as he wandered about the grounds, \"crooning\" this prophecy in wild, wailing fashion; she called him within, and bade him repeat it to her husband. Beardie got into a towering passion, and roared \u2014 \" No more of thy tale I shall hear But high on Finhaven thy grey head and lyre Shall bleach on the point of the spear ! \" The lady craved pity, but nane wad he gie \u2014 The poor aged minstrel must die, And Crawford's ain hand placed the grey head and lyre On the spikes of the turret sae high.

About the end ofthe sixteenth century, the then Earl ot Crawford, an \"Earl"], [406, "386 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. ii David \" and his lady, became the sub jects of this tale. Earl David had been married to Lilias Drummond, a daughter of the Drummond of Stobhall, and an heiress to great riches. In an evil hour, this lady had made some joke \u2014 of a kind not vvise \u2014 concerning the paternity of her child. Her husband misunderstood her, thought that she had been unfaithful to him, and dismissed her summarily to her early home. The touching record represents the ill-fated lady as riding back to Finhaven to beseech her husband to forgive the sad jest, to confide in her leal-heartedness once more, and to receive her again to his heart. But Earl David, with an impatience which can scarcely be said to have done credit either to head or heart, sent her away unforgiven. Scarce had she gone, however, when his heart misgave him ; the echoes of that pleading voice \u2014 the voice, surely, of one who vvas true \u2014 lingered in his ears, and, taking horse, he rode in haste to Stobhall. He owned that he had wronged her, begged now that she would pardon him and return to her home at Finhaven. But it was too late; the pure affection, which had thought it no harm to jest over the idea of an un faithfulness which was morally impos sible to one who loved as she, was crushed; and Lilias, it is said, refused to forgive. The end of the story is evidently mere romance. Legend says that husband and wife died heart-broken in one night, and were buried in one tomb; but those who best know the family history deny the truth of this tragic ending, and give the best of all proofs by telling how, after the death of Lilias, Earl David married a second wife, one of the family of Athole. \" He called ane of his livery-men, To come to him right speedilie, ' Gae shut my yetts, gae steek my doors Keep Lady Crawlord out frae me.' \" When she came to Earl Crawford's yet', She tirled gently at the pin \u2014 'Oh sleep ye, wake ye, Karl Crawford, Ye'll open, let Lady Crawford in? \" 'Come down, come down, oh, Earl Crawford, And speak some comfort unto me, And if ye winna come yoursel' You'll send your gentleman to me, \" ' Indeed I winna come mysel', Nor send my gentleman to thee, For I tauld you, when we did par:, Nae mair my spouse ye'd ever be.' \" She laid her mouth then to the yetts, And aye the tears drap't frae her e'e.

I^^^^^HNthese days it is I not easyto remem- I ber that Forfar I the county-town of I Forfarshire, since I it has been H very much out-dis- tanced in the race of fortune by the sister town of Dundee. Yet so it is, and it would be a sad omission to move on- ward in our sketches without having something to say of a town which boasts itself the capital of an important county. Like most of the towns of which we have had to speak in this portion of our book, it lays claim to a hoary anti quity. There was in the neighbourhood a Roman camp, of which such distinct remains are left that students of antiquity have been able to form a pretty definite idea of its size and shape. We shall not trouble our readers with the theories which are made to revolve around this Roman camp. It has been supposed, for instance, that Agricola encamped here with his whole army, and perhaps it vvas so : we shall not trust the anti quarians too far when they begin to speculate. Forfar also had its Castle \u2014 or rather castles \u2014 in olden times, and was, like so many other towns in Scotland, the tem porary abode of the Court, always more migratory than that of England. Eight centuries ago, it would seem that Malcolm Canmore often resided here with his beautiful queen, Margaret, sister of Edgar Atheling, the Saxon heir to the English throne. Its site is now matter of conjecture, and it is only pro bable that it may be traced in some remains which are to be seen on \" Queen Margaret's Inch,\" an islet in the \" Loch of Forfar.\" The place is worthy of special regard when we think how that here probably many a scheme for the improvement of the country, socially"], [408, "388 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. and religiously, vvas conceived and dis cussed by the good queen, and that Forfar in this way became the centre of something like an early Reformation. were in very comfortable circumstances. In later times, Forfar has had asso ciations of a very different kind, and it may be reckoned as somewhat unfor tunate for the town that its name should recall so forcibly the story of witch trying and witch-burning which is so painful a chapter in history. A relic of the time vvas preserved in the \" Witches' Bridle,\" a hideous thing in bridle shape, which was put round the necks of the condemned, and which had a gag at tached to it which was placed in the mouth of the victim, perhaps with the double intent of keeping her from crying out and of preventing her from uttering words to corrupt the people. Mention is made of one John Kinked, who was sup posed to be specially expert in discov ering witches, as having been brought to Forfar to help in bringing offenders there to judgment; and a Commission appointed by the Privy Council sat at Forfar to try those who were accused of the \" abominable sin of witchcraft.\" The following extract gives an idea of the confessions made by some of these peo ple : \u2014 It is not easy to \"redd out,\" as a Scotchman would say, between Boece's \" two royal castles,\" but it is supposed that the second of them stood on the Castle-hill of Forfar, and that it was built during the reign of William the Lion, if not earlier.* Here, in 1296, that great enemy of Scotland. Edward I. of England, found a lodging for himself and his attendants ; and from that time, save fora slight interval, it remained in English hands till 130S, about which time it vvas taken by Robert Bruce, who slew most of the English garrison, and utterly destroyed the Castle. The real agent in the taking of the Castle vvas a person named \" Philip the Forester,\" who scaled the Castle in the night, let down the bridge to make an entrance for the Scots, and put most of the in mates to death, those who escaped, we are told by Jervise, being drowned in the loch outside. So ended Forfar Castle ; but it w7ould seem that even after this the tower did not cease to be a royal residence; for Bruce appears upon good evidence to have still had a house there. \"Helen Guthrie confessed, first, that about the time when St.Johnstown's bridge was carried away (the Bridge of Tay at Perth, carried away in October, 162 1) she murdered her mother's daughter, the said daughter being her half-sister, and about six or seven years of ag-e ; and that for the said murder her mother did always give her her malisone, yea, and upon her deathbed continued to give her malisone, notwithstanding the said Helen's earnest requests and beseechings to the contrarie. Another ancient interest of the town lies in the priory at Restennet, which stood where the church of the neighbour hood had stood still earlier. Some curious privileges this old priory had, amongst them (we follow Dr. Marshall's quotation) the following: \u2014 \"The up lifting on each coming- of the King to Forfar, for each day he abides there, two loaves ofthe lord's bread, four loaves of the second bread, and six loaves called hugmans ; two flagons of the better ale, two flagons of the second ale, and two pairs of messes of each of the three courses from the kitchen.\" Other special advantages are mentioned by Jervise, and altogether we should con clude that the ancient brethren here \" Then about three years, the last oate seed tyme, she was at a meeting in the Kirkyard of Forfar, and that yr (there) were prnt (present) there the devill him self in the shape of a black iron heived man, and a number of other persons, besides Helen herself \u2014 and that they all danced together, and that the ground under them was all syre slaughter"], [409, "FORFAR. 389 that Andrew Watsone had his usual staff in his hand \u2014 although he vvas a blind man yet he danced as nimblie as any ofthe company, and made as great merriement by singing his old songs, and that the said Isobel Guthrie did sing her song called Pinkletum tinkletum. \" Helen goes to confess at another meeting. ' It was at midnight when they danced together a whyle, and then went to Mary Rind's house, and sat down together about the table, the devil being present at the head of it. And that some of them went tojon Beinny's house, he being a brewer, and brought ale from hence; and ithers went to Alex. Heigh's house, and brought aquavit\u00e6 from hence, and thus made themselves so good that she went on drinking, and the gude wife not being in the way, and nobody else chancing to observe her, the tippling cow finished the whole supply. By-and-by, out came the wife to see how her \" home-brewed \" was getting on, when, lo! nothing was to be seen but an empty tub and the cow. What vvas the ale-wife to do ? Her loss was great, and it required some ingenuity to dis cover how best it could be repaired. The only chance seemed to be the law, and to law she went, and the business was taken from court to court, till it landed in the Court of Session. Here a contention vvas made by the counsel for the owner of the cow, that by com mon law no charge was ever made for a \" standing-drink,\" and the court, glad no doubt to get rid of the matter, pro fessed that in these circumstances there were no precedents in law to guide them, and remitted the whole matter to the Provost of the burgh. He in his turn called a meeting of the inhabitants, and in their presence put the searching ques tion, whether the cow took her drink standing. The brewster-wife had there upon to own that it was so, and the Pro vost immediately dismissed the case. merrie, and that the devil made much of them all, and especially of Marion Rind. And at the said meeting they agreed to undoe the foresaid John Beinny in his means,' etc. \"She also confessed \u2014 'That at the first of these meetings Andrew Watson, Marion Rind, Elspat Alexander, Isobel Schyrie, and herself went up to the Kirk-wall, about the fartheast dore, and raised a young bairne unbaptized, and took several pieces thereoff, and that they made a pye thereof, that they might eat of it, that by this means they might never (as they thought) make a confession of their witchcraft.' \" So far for a few reminiscences of Forfar. The more commercial reader, who does not care much for either old castles or witches, or drinking cows, may be interested to know that Forfar has had, through many generations, a special fame as a shoemaking town, its specialty being the making- of those heavy shoes which are designated by the name of brogues. Well-nigh two cen turies and a-half ago a eulogist of Forfar thus wrote of it and its devotion to St. Crispin's art : \u2014 The records of this dark time are too painful to dwell further upon them; and we turn aside rapidly to relieve our reader by quoting an amusing story which has somehow got wrapped up with the history of Forfar, and which illustrates some of the early refinements of Scotch law. A \" brewster-wife \"\u2014 i.e., a brewer of ale for the neighbourhood had made a large supply, in view, pro bably, of some special gathering, and had set it out in a great tub or cauldron at the door that it might be cool before the evening. A cow which was passing at the time was arrested by the fascinating smell, and stopped to taste. The ale was The ruins of a Palace thee decore, A fruitfull Lake, and fruitfull Land much more, Thy Precincts (it's consest) much straightened be, Yet Ancient Scotland did give Power to thee : Angus and other places of the Land, Yeeld to thy Jurisdiction and command. Noblis unto the People Laws do give, By Handy-Crafts the Vulgar sort do live."], [410, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 390 whilst less is heard of its rivalry with neighbouring towns, Forfar has some reputation for bickerings within its own borders; and we have heard say that the \"Toon Cooncil\" of this royal burgh is looked upon with special favour by the local newspaper-folk, because the \"scenes\" in it so frequently relieve the monotony of their columns of news. They pull off Bullocks-hydes and make them meet When tanned, to cover handsome Virgins' feet : From thee are Sandals to light Umbrians sent, And soils with latches to Rope-Climbers lent : And Rullions wherewith the Bowrs do go To keep their feet unhurt with Yse and Snow.

Enough to speak of it as a pleasant town, with nothing specially remarkable in its. natural surroundings, save the beautiful loch of which we have already spoken. It is now comparatively free from the reproach which once attached to it of hav ing a confused and dirty appearance ; thatched houses have long ago given way to others of more comely style; the tumble-down parish church has yielded to an edifice more \"square to the winds,\" and altogether in its outward seeming we understand that the county town sees no reason to be ashamed of itself. They laid their Yoak on necks of other I.-inJs, Forfar doth tie their feet and leggs with bands. In this way there long existed a rivalry between the town of Forfar and the neighbouring town of Kirriemuir, which, by the way, we are sorry to have to pass over without devoting an article to it and its interesting history. \"Kirrie'' was famous for its weavers ; and many a fight used to take place between the \"sutors\" of Forfar and the \"weavers\" of Kirriemuir, by way of championing the dignity of their respective callings.

In the time of Robert II. the castle and \" thanedom \" were bestowed on one John Lyon, who bore what we may call a left-handed relationship to the king, and in the Lyon family the former has remained ever since. It must be noted, however, that after the execution of Lady Glamis in 1537 for witchcraft, the estate vvas considered to be forfeited. The castle was \"restored\" in 1621, and we see it now substantially as it became at that date, save for alterations and adorn ments which have been executed from time to time. ofthe town of Forfar stands Glamis Castle, the seat now of the Earl of Strathmore, but less interesting on this account than on that of its ancient associations. Were it not that we are eager to pass northward, and therefore impatient of dwelling upon these Lowland places, we might be expected to say a great deal about this place ; as it is, a few sentences must suffice. Like so many other places in Scotland, Glamis Castle vvas on several occasions occupied by royalty, notably by Alex ander III., in 1263-4; and in the Cham berlain Rolls, we are told, there are many curious details to be found, show ing how royal persons in that ancient The gardens are an object of admira tion to all visitors, on account of their great extent, the taste with which they have been laid out, and the range of hot houses which they contain, said to be amongst the finest in Scotland. But for us the most important thing"], [412, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 392 to be said about Glamis is that here, according to ancient story, Malcolm II. was murdered. We are not careful to inquire as to the truth of this story, but we note it as indicative at least of the kind of feeling \u2014 akin to reverence \u2014 which has been associated in the local mind with the place. A writer in Anderson's \" Scottish Nation \" writes thus sceptically regarding the matter of fact, and we are content to leave the more curious reader to search out the truth for him self: \u2014 \"Both Boece and Fordun assert that Malcolm II. vvas murdered in the central tower of the castle of Glamis in Forfarshire, which seems to have been his usual place of residence. . . . Tra dition still pretends to point out a pas sage in the castle, with blood-stains on the floor, where the fatal act was perpetra ted. It avers also that the ground being covered with snow, the assassins, in their flight, mistook their way, and un consciously entered on the loch of For far, when the ice broke, and they were drowned \u2014 a very convenient method of getting rid of imaginary murderers. The whole story is a fiction of that fertile inventor of Scottish history, Hector Boece, and is totally incredible, even although no less than three obelisks, with symbolic characters, representative ofthe conspiracy and the pursuit of the fancied regicides, have for centuries stood in different parts of the parish of Glamis, to commemorate it. Pinkerton contends that Malcolm died a natural death, which is more likely than the fabulous account of his assassination.\" This Malcolm, with whom Glamis is rightly or wrongly associated, was the second Scottish king of that name, and ascended the throne in 1003. It was he who did such brave battle against the Danes, winning a famous victory over them at Mortlach, where a church vvas reared to commemorate the event. Once more he gained a victory over them, as we have elsewhere chronicled, near Carnoustie; and in a third great contest at Slains, the Danes, on this occasion led by Canute, were finally defeated, and forced to relinquish their invasion in despair. Later, in 103 1, the same nation made another attack on the kingdom of Scotland, it seems with somewhat better success. This Scottish king was indeed a man of war from his youth, and, not content with his brave contests with foes from foreign shores, we find him in 1018 at war with the Northumbrians, giving battle to Uchtred of Northumberland at Carham. What the direct issue of the battle vvas we do not know ; but we do know that it vvas an important link in a chain of events which led to the cession to Scotland of the rich land of the Lothians. Just at the time when this cession was being made, the sturdy warrior \u2014 vir victoriosissimus, they came to call him \u2014 is said to have breathed his last at the hand of assassins, or quietly in his bed.

Wandering across the \"muir,\" fair with the bloom of the heather and the \"whin-buss,\" and fresh with the air of the mountains, we make our way to Edzell Castle, which stands just at the foot of the Grampians, and on the left bank of the Westwater. It is supposed that an older castle once stood here, and that that which we now see in ruin is relatively new. Be it so; such as it is, its ruins have been described as \" the most magnificent of any in the shires of Angus and Mearns, except those of Dunottar.\" The donjon, which gets the name of the \" Stirling Tower,\" and is believed to have been reared by the family bearing that name, is in a fairly entire condition, the outer wall and the ground-floor still remaining. It rises to the height of sixty feet, and is reckoned to be a very fine piece of workmanship.

The grim old keep has walls from four to six feet thick, and the base floor of the tower is divided into two dark cells, popularly believed to have been places of imprisonment for offenders, but really known, says Mr. Jervise, to have been \"cellars for the preservation of choice liquors and viands,\" prisoners of a kind so different from the other, that they were, no doubt, made very welcome to the table of the Lord of Edzell.

But Edzell has interests stretching far back, and those who are acquainted with Mr. Jervise's \" Lands of the Lind says \" will remember how large a part it plays in his story.

During the reign of Charles I., John of Edzell took part with the Covenanters, and suffered accordingly.

Stretching from the keep northwards are the buildings which formed the \" new \" portion of the fortress, and which were built by David of Edzell, after wards ninth earl of Crawford. These are now themselves so old that it is only possible to guess at the style of architec ture employed, and the only remaining evidence of the refined taste displayed is a small part ofthe entrance to the Great Hall, beautiful alike in style and in pro- portion. We shall not take time, however, to dwell longer upon architectural details; nor have we space to speak of the beauti ful flower-garden, beautiful even now, but interesting mainly as throwing out a hint of the high art to which, in early days, our forefathers had risen in the gentle work of gardening. We must, however, stay here to note the picture of the old-fashioned baronial hospitality which Mr. Jervise associates with this Castle of Edzell. He says : \u2014 \" From the magnificent style in which cookery vvas conducted at Edzell, and the liberality of its owners to the poor, it was fami liarly known by the enviable title of 'The Kitchen of Angus.' Oxen were roasted whole, and everything conducted in a correspondingly sumptuous style; and daily, after the family had dined, the poor of the parish congregated in the court-yard, and, taking their seats on the stone benches (which still remain) on both sides of the outer entrance passage, they received their quota of beef and beer from the fair hands of the lady or daughters of 'the proud house of Edzell.'\" It is satisfactory to know that this plain speaking had, at least, the effect of exempting him from levy. Calamities of another kind than those indicated also began to fall upon the house. John of Edzell died in 1671, and was succeeded by his son David, who, after wasting the already only too moderate possessions of his family by extravagance, died in 1698, leaving a Times of distress came, however, upon Edzell Castle, and removed its ancient grandeur, diminishing at the same time the greatness of that branch of the"], [415, "\"THE PROUD HOUSE OF EDZELL!' 395 son, David, w7ho vvas to be \" the last of the Lindsays of Edzell,\" and two daughters, Margaret and Janet, around the latter of whom a tragic history has woven itself. Indeed, something of a tragic history hangs around all the three last survivors of the house. The \" last Laird\" had the misfortune to be thwarted in love, and from that time he seems to have been in a state of what might be called desperate carelessness regarding himself and his house. In political and ecclesiastical matters he seems to have wandered far from the traditions of Edzell, and his ruin vvas finally wrought by his espousal of the cause of the Stuarts. He actually sold his patrimony to Lord Panmure in order to raise some followers for the Jacobite cause, and left the venerable house of his father, to go he knew7 not whither. A short time was spent on a small property in Fife, but probably here, also, resources soon became exhausted, and he actually ended his days while serving as ostler at an inn in Kirkwall ! The story of his leaving the castle is touchingly told in the \" Lives of the Lindsays,\" being apparently taken from oral tradition : \u2014 in the large hall, sadly occupied \u2014 destroying papers sometimes, reading papers sometimes, sometimes writing, sometimes sitting mournfully silent \u2014 unable to fix his thoughts on the present or to contemplate the suture. In the course of the following day he left the Castle in the same manner in which he had come; he saw none of his people or tenants, his one attendant only accom panying him ; they rode away, taking with them as much as was valuable or useful as they could conveniently carry. And, turning round to take a last look of the old towers, he drew a last long sigh, and wept. He was never seen here again.\" Poor Janet Lindsay's story was the \"old, old story\" of love and beauty abused and ruined, her virtue's destroyer having been a man claiming technically the title of \"nobleman,\" who met his death on the battlefield of Almanza, in Spain, in 1707. Janet died in England, and was laid in a dishonoured grave. The elder sister, Margaret, vvas married to the Laird of Aitherny, in Fife, and brought with her a large dowry; but ruin tracked her also, though not in the sad way of her sister. She grew melan choly over the decay of her house \u2014 a decay which may have been hastened, but cannot be said to have been caused, by the heavy burden which her dowry laid upon its scanty revenue, and she lived, moreover, to see the ruin of her adopted Aitherny. Here again, like everybody who writes upon this Edzell history, we betake ourselves to the \" Lives of the Lindsays \" for a sketch, singularly beautiful, of this lady's last visit to Edzell. It has about it a measure of rhythm and cadence which makes it seem more like an anrient ballad almost than a narrative: \u2014 \"The Laird, like his father, had been a wild and wasteful man, and had been long awa' ; he was deeply engaged with the unsuccessful party of the Stuarts, and the rumour of their defeat was still occupying the minds of all the country side. One afternoon the poor Baron, with a sad and sorrowful countenance and heavy heart, and followed by only one of a' his company, both on horse back, came to the Castle, almost un noticed by any.

She vvas tall and beautiful, and dressed in deep mourning. 'When she came near the ancient burying-place,' says the faint voice of the past, ' she alighted and went into the chapel, for it was then open; the doors had been driven down, the stone figures and carved work was all broken, and bones lay scattered about. The poor lady went in, and sat down among it a', and wept sore at the ruin of her house and the fate of her family, for no one doubted of her being one of them, though no oneknew who she was, or where she came from. After a while she came out, and was driven in the coach up to the Castle ; she went through as much of it as she could, for stairs had fallen down, and roofs had fallen in, \u2014 and in one room in particular she staid a long while, weeping sadly. She said the place was dear to her, though she had now no right to it, and she carried some of the earth away with her,' It was Margaret of Edzell, the Lady of Aitherny, as ascertained by an independent tradi tion, derived from a venerable lady of the House of Aitherny, who lived to a great age, and always spoke of her with bitterness as the proud bird out of the eagle's nest who had ruined her family. ' She came once to my father's house,' said she to my informant, 'with two of her children. She was on her way to Edzell Castle. It was years since it had passed away from her family.

She was a sair changed woman when she came back \u2014 her haughty manner was gone, and her proud look turned into sadness. She had found everything changed at Edzell since she left it, a gay lady, the bride of Aitherny. For the noise and merriment of those days, she found silence and sadness \u2014 for the many going to and fro, solitude and mouldering walls \u2014 for the plentiful board of her father, his house only, roofless and deserted. When she looked out from the win dows, it was the same gay and smil ing landscape, but all within was ruin and desolation.

The former, the only view which has much support, is that they were reared as places of refuge and defence for the families of the men in those parts, to which they might repair in times of in vasion, which were so frequently recur ring. The latter theory has to do with Fairyland, a domain to which in difficulty common people have as regularly be taken themselves for a solution of the mystery as astronomers do to comets, or German philosophers to their \" inner consciousness.\" \"The place,\" says popu lar tradition, \"vvas the home of the fairies, and a brawny witch carried the whole ofthe works one fine morning from the bed of the Westwater to the top of this hill; and while she was carrying it in her apron, the apron-string broke, and the biggest and heaviest of the stones fell out on the north side of the hill; so there it lies, still to be seen by any one, and recognised as witness of the story.\" have usually a great deal to say about Caterthun. The name has a somewhat ludicrous sound to the ear of a Southerner, and does not seem naturally to associate itself with any very romantic thoughts; but For- farshire people speak with deep respect and even awe of the hill which bears this curious name. Cater thun is situated about five miles from Brechin in the direction of Menmuir, and forms a pleasant excursion from Edzell ; and those who love a gentle climb will be rewarded by a beautiful and exten sive view from its summit. But the chief thing which has marked out this hill \u2014 or rather ridge of hills \u2014 for notice, is the line of forts upon them, about which all manner of surmises have been formed. One portion of the ridge\u2014 called White Caterthun\u2014 is surrounded by a circle of white stone ; while another \u2014 called Black or Brown Caterthun\u2014 is encircled by rings of dark turf. The two forts are about a mile from each other. White Caterthun is about 300 feet high, and commands a view of the strath in which it stands, west, south, and north. It en closed an area of about 500 feet by 200, and the wall which surrounded this consisted of loose stones, and was about 100 feet thick at the base, and 25 feet at the top. A deep ditch had been cut outside this wall, on the other side of which was an earthen breastwork; indeed, it appears that there was a succession of outworks, ditches and ramparts, stretching to the foot of the hill. The fort of Brown Strange how these odd stories have got about; and the wilder the scenery the more likely you will find some odd tale to account for certain odd appearances in Nature and in Art. Now some scrip ture character will be introduced, and if there be a big boulder at the top of a hill, you will be told that Samson carried it thither; now perhaps a scrap of classical lore will come in to solve the question of how such a thing got into such a quarter.

The loch is after all only what Highlanders would call a \"lochan\" or little loch, but the scenery about it, surrounded as it is by mountains, is wild and \u2014 if we may so say \u2014 grimly beautiful. It was here that that very natural and nature-loving divine, Dr. Guthrie, used to come and spend his summer holiday, resting awhile amid these solitudes from his abundant labours on behalf of his fellow-men, and sometimes delighting the sparse inhabitants of the glen by occupying the pulpit of the little Free Church, and preaching one of his elo quent, yet simple, sermons. way to the northern University city along this route, than by the commonplace railway-line by which we may suppose you have come so far as Brechin. Before you move on\u2014 if you have more time than we have now \u2014 a visit to Fettercairn and Fasque would well repay you. The way leads over the North Esk by the Bridge of Gannochy, which marks one of the most romantic spots in the district ; and many an artist finds his w7ay here to studythe old bridge and the rocks which mark its span, as well as the awful ravine over which it is thrown. And Fasque \u2014 or Fasky, as it used to be called \u2014 with its beautiful mansion-house and chapel, will please the visitor. The mansion-house is the home of the genial \u2014 but by no means politically \u00ab>\u00abgenial \u2014 brother of Mr. Gladstone, \u2014 Sir Thomas Gladstone. Lochlee has a church which possesses more than a local interest; for it bears the name of St. Drostan (popularly cor rupted into \"Droustie\"), who was a saint of royal blood, and vvas for a time Abbot of Donegal. He came back to Scotland, and settling down in this se cluded locality, preached the Gospel to"], [419, "GLOOMY GLENESK. 399 the simple denizens ofthe glen, and died at Lochlee in the year 809. There used to be seen a wooden cell in which he was believed to have passed his days, and a portion of a simple cross which he had set up ; but now these have disappeared, and, if the place which once knew him knows him still, it is because his saintly memory has passed into the history of the place. The \"kirk\" is sometimes called the \" Kirk of Droustie,\" and a pool in the neighbourhood is called the \" Monk's Pool,\" pointing back to days when he and other monks who doubtless gathered around him used to get their Lenten feast from out of the river. It does not appear that the Church here ever attained to any great impor tance as an ecclesiastical centre ; and about the time of the Reformation it vvas served by a \"reader\" or exhorter, whose stipend was twenty-six shillings and ninepence ! Until a century ago, the old edifice, the ruins of which are now standing, we believe, vvas thatched with heather ; it was then slated, but it never claimed any sort of grandeur in appearance. It stands by the very side of the loch, and the waters some times rise up into the churchyard in tempestuous weather, and wash about the ruins of the house of God. Many a visitor stays a moment or two in passing to look into the \"auld kirkyard,\" to read some of the curious epitaphs which it contains, and especially to stand by the grave of the gifted Scottish poet, Alex ander Ross, who wrote, amongst other fine things, the favourite Scottish song, \" Woo'd an' married an' a'.\" This man was schoolmaster in the place throughout his life at the modest salary of \u00a320 a year, and while one regrets that his gifts did not find larger scope, it is pleasing to think how rich our country has been in these hidden men of power, and also to dream that his muse and heart were kept more pure amid these solitudes than had he been, like Burns, brought out into the tempting gaieties of a society which was more likely to drag him down than to lift him up. Musing over these things, and imagining our selves in this country churchyard, we think naturally of the immortal lines of one of the finest of our English poets :\u2014 \" Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire ; Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed, Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre.\" We come now to another object of interest on the way up into the High lands\u2014Invermark Castle, standing fitly in the midst of bold mountain scenery, and known now to tourists as the High land resort of the Earl of Dalhousie, who, however, cannot find any shelter in the ancient ruin, and sojourns close by at Invermark Lodge. The Castle occu pies a notable position as commanding the pass over Mount Keen from the land of the Tay to that of the Dee. In old times it must have received many a visit from contending clans, as vvell as from the numerous freebooters, cattle-lifters, etc., who transacted their business in that neighbourhood. To-day it marks more peaceful raids ; for, since our be loved Sovereign has made her Northern home at Balmoral, this road has natu rally become a favourite means of access to that beautiful spot. The district of Glenmark, as this part of the country is called, is full of inte resting incident. Here, for example, is a spot called \"Eagil's Loup,\" a wild spot on the little river Mark, which has its legend : It is told how the young laird of Edzell, of former days, having been in hiding hereabout, was surprised by Lord Crawford and some of his retainers. Edzell was defenceless, but he had a good pair of legs and no want of daring either ; and rushing from his pursuers, he made a tremendous leap overa yawning chasm in the Mark, and gaining the opposite rock safely, vvas suon under the shelter of his own castie. Hence the name \"Eagil's Loup.\""], [420, "400 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND.

Those standing are each pretty nearly five feet five inches above ground, one of them is three feet nine broad, and another two feet three, and the third about one foot eight inches. At thickest they are respectively thirteen, fourteen, and twenty inches. The largest lies on the ground, and is nine feet five inches long, by seven feet five broad. Others of nearly equal dimensions with the erect stones are built into the adjoin ing dyke, and another is so high and strong as to form the centre support or pillar of a cart shed. Although these circles are erroneously described in the New Statistical Account (where they are stated as being almost complete), many old people remember of their being more entire than they are now; but the late tenant was one of too many who saw no use in going a little distance for building materials when hecouldgetthem at his door, however revered or valuable ; and as his 'Gothicism' was either un known to, or unheeded by his landlord, one stone after another disappeared in whole, or vvas blown to pieces, as cir cumstances required.\" A word must be said concerning the Druidical remains in this neighbourhood. First of all there are the \" Rocking Stones ; \" these are boulders which are so delicately balanced upon a pile of other stones that, as it is said, a breath of wind would be enough to set them shaking. Many a surmise has been formed regard ing the purpose of these remarkable boulders, but nobody really knows any thing of their meaning. Were they test or touch stones by which \u2014 according as they moved or not at the moment of the ordeal \u2014 prisoners were adjudged inno cent or guilty ? It maybe so, but this is only a guess of the antiquarians, and must not be taken for anything more. The poet Mason is quoted by Jervise as giving a somewhat kindred suggestion regarding one of them : \u2014 \" It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch Of him whose breast is pure ; but to a traitor, Tho' e'en a giant's prowess nerved his arm, It stands as fixed as Snowdon.\" Of the natural appearance of this neighbourhood a word or two may be said. Majesty and grandeur are the words which alone describe it; there is no softness, nor would you call the scene a \"fair\" landscape; it is wild, \"rugged, and bare.\" Wilder, perhaps, it vvas a few years ago, before Invermark Lodge was built, and trees began to be planted about; but yet there is little to soften and soothe in this higher Glenesk scenery. In the midst of it are two converging rivers \u2014 the Lee and the Mark \u2014 which combine with a few small streams to form the head of the North Esk, \u2014 the Lee, indeed, a somewhat quiet stream (to speak very relatively) ; the Mark, a genuine mountain torrent, making its determined way through a wild and eerie valley, only made to seem more wild from the grassy meads which occur Then again there are the \" Stan'in' Stanes,\" or Druidical circles, at Col meallie, forming a lesser Stonehenge. Antiquarians have been greatly exercised to know what these may have been used for in ancient times, and it seems not unlikely that they were in a manner shrines of the ancient worship, acting both as temples for prayer and sacrifice, and as burial-places for the dead. Mr. Jervise gives the following de scription ofthe \" Stan'in' Stanes\" : \u2014 \"The circles of Colmeallie are ofthe common concentric kind, and the outer encloses an area of forty-five by thirty-six feet, and consists in all of from fourteen to twenty stones, including three large slabs in the centre, which are supposed to have formed the altar.

Better for such a one to take himself away to the softer scenes of Tweedside, or to the dear and lovely landscapes of our English lake-country, or at least to get across the pass to Deeside, and glad himself with its generally kinder aspect. Thither we also must now be going, glad ourselves in some measure to escape out of this glen, and to leave stronger and more buoyant spirits to linger amid these scenes of wild majesty. Perhaps the influence on these will be somewhat of a corrective kind if they linger awhile; the bare hills and the mountain torrents will overcome them also, and send them back to their lowland homes thankful for quieter and more cheerful surroundings, and softer and humbler than erewhile they were in nature and in heart.

The cloven sides, rising up almost per pendicularly, form a gorge of surpass ing magnificence, leaving little more than space for a road, and a small stream which runs along its side.\" And while you are lingering awhile in this defile, it may not be amiss to tell you of a famous scene which once took place here. be black enough for the Black Colonel ; for while Cunningham's troop was fast coming up behind him, another com pany vvas by this time hastening to the other end of the pass to block his ad vance. But horse and horseman had the swiftness and daring of the roe, and just when the two companies were hemming him in, he rushed up the steep, rocky walls of the pass. It was a terrible moment, and the two companies of soldiers no doubt watched to see their foe and his steed hurled down lifeless to the bottom of the pre cipice. But what was their surprise to see the noble animal rushing onward without any fear, save the fear of what was behind, until at last it had brought its rider to the top of the hill, to look down in triumphant amusement upon his baffled enemies below. \"Ah!\" said one of the latter, \" if they had told us that he could fly as vvell as ride, we might have spared ourselves the roughest ride I ever had.\" That discretion vvas the better part of valour, Cunningham now began to think ; and so he left the Black Colonel to go his way. A little way from this pass is the old village of Tullich, with the ruins of the \"Auld Kirk of Tullich\" on the south side of the w7ay. This place has had its name for ever as sociated with a certain \" reel,\" or dance, which, it is said, took its origin in a very curious fashion. Early last century, upon a very stormy Sunday, the people gathered together at the church, as their manner was, in good time ; but the minister in his somewhat distant manse, thinking that nobody would come out on such a day, had resolved to stay at home. The waiting people began to be very cold, and proceeded to clap their hands and stamp their feet to get up some heat. By-and-by, they thought they would be the better for some refreshment, and ale was procured. Soon the ale began to do its work, and what with its influence and the associations of the foot-stamp- The \"Black Colonel,\" Colonel Far quharson, a redoubtable soldier of two hundred years ago, was resting in the castle of Braichley, after a night's carousing and revelry, when he was surprised by a company of soldiers under Colonel Cunningham, who came to arrest him as a rebel against the throne of William and Mary. The Colonel being a famous rider, one of the swiftest horses Braichley could afford was given to him, and ere Cunningham could get at him, he had fled.

The story goes on to tell how that in twelve months every one who took part in it was dead; but, how ever this may be, such is the report as to the institution ofthe \"Reel of Tullich.\" I arose with the dawn ; with my dog as my guide, From mountain to mountain I bounded along ; I breasted the billows of Dee's rushing tide, And heard at a distance the Highlander's song ; At eve, on my heath-covered couch of repose, No dreams, save of Mary, were spread to my view ; And warm to the skies my devotions arose, For the first of my prayers was a blessing on you.

For yonder are to be seen Cairngorm, which rises to the height of 4,250 feet, and Ben Muich-(or Muick)-dhui, second only to Ben Nevis, standing 4,296 feet above the sea. In your daily wanderings and saunterings you look at them and dream about them until they become part of your being, and you scarce envy those hardier spirits who have been content only when they have scaled their heights, and undone the sweet, yet awful, mystery which seems to you to lie about them. more ; As the last of my race, I must wither alone, And delight but in days I have witnessed before ; Ah ! splendour has raised, but embittered my lot ; More dear were the scenes which my infancy knew : Though my hopes may have failed, yet they are not forgot ; Though cold is my heart still it lingers with you. When I see some dark hill point its crest to the sky, I think of the rocks that o'ershadow Colbleen ; When I see the soft blue of a love-speaking eye, I think of those eyes that endear'd the rude scene. Yet the day may arrive when the mountains once more Shall rise to my sight in their mantles of snow ; But while these soar above me unchanged as before Of lesser height, and therefore within the powers of an ordinary climber, is the grand summit of Morven, 2,880 feet high. It was this lofty \" ben \" of. which Byron sang, in memory of his old days in the Highlands, and it may not be amiss to quote a. few stanzas of the poem in which the reference occurs. They show the impression which the Braemar Highlands \u2014 and Braemar beauty, too, in the person of Mary Duff \u2014 made upon his early years : \u2014 Will Mary be there to receive me ? \u2014 ah, no ! Adieu, then, ye hills, where my childhood was bred, Thou sweet-flowing Dee, to thy waters adieu ! No home in the sorest shall shelter my head, \u2014 Ab, Mary, what home could be mine but with you? Moore, in his \"Life of Byron,\" has tried with much ingenuity to show how little direct influence landscapes seen in tender youth can have upon the mind, and endeavours to show how that, the most that can be looked for is the re ception of impressions to be stored up in memory and beautified with the light of imagination in after years. \" Such im pressions,\" he says, \" as Lord Byron received in his childhood must be classed with the various other remembrances which that period leaves behind \u2014 of its innocence, its sports, its first hopes and affections \u2014 all of them reminiscences which the poet afterwards converts to his use, but which no more make the poet When I roved a young Highlander o'er the dark heath, And climbed thy sweet summit, O Morven, of snow !

The lake contains two islands, one of which is called Malcolm Can more's Island, from the fact that there once stood on it a castle which the great Malcolm is said to have used as a prison. The loch, however, has a special interest to the botanist and the florist. \"There is,\" says Crombie, in his little book on Braemar, \"a much more abundant and varied vegetation to be found on its sur face and by its sides than in any of the other lochs. The w'hite and yellow water-lilies, seen nowhere else in the district, float upon its bosom amongst the reeds at its western extremity ; the water lobelia, with its clusters of light blue drooping flowers, is scattered here and there in the same direction ; the quillwort is not uncommon in the shallow water; while carices and horsetails are very abundant in some parts along its margin. Nor is it less [? more] deficient in reference to its fauna, frequented as it is in winter by large flocks of geese, and at all seasons by the wild duck and teal, supplying victims for the gun of the sportsman ; while numerous pike, and trout of large size, afford first-rate play for the rod of the angler.\" There runs into it on the north-west a little \"burn\" called the Burn of Vat. This runs through a small defile or gully, on either side of which the rocks rise to a con siderable height ; and it gets the name of the \" Vat,\" we suppose, from the fact that the restrained waters in the time of flood have scooped out the granite rocks on either side into a concave shape, \" like half the top of a dome.\" Be this as it may, nothing is clearer than that Byron himself looked back to this Highland phase of his child-life as having much to do with the poetic cha racter of his after life. It seemed to himself that all his dreams of the scenery amid which he wandered in later days were intermingled with those earlier dreams of boyhood among the hills and valleys of Deeside. Does he not say \u2014 He who first met the Highland's swelling blue, Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue, Hail in each crag a friend's familiar face, And clasp the mountain in his mind's embrace. Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine, Adored the Alp, and loved the Apennine, Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep Jove's Ida and Olympus crown the deep. But 'twas not all long ages' love, nor all Their nature held me in iheir thrilling thrall ; The infant rapture still survived the boy, And Loch-na-gar with Ida look'd o'er Troy, Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount, And Highland linns with Castalie's fair fount? We shall by-and-by visit Loch-na- Gar, and once more we shall have Byron with us; but meanwhile it will be enough for us as we linger amongst these scenes to remember that they in fluenced the genius of one to whom English poetic literature owes so much, and to whom she had owed more, had his life not been early poisoned with the love of lower things. A scene well worthy of a visit is the Loch Kinnord, or Ceannor, which you see as you go from Ballater to Aboyne. If you make a little excursion to it from the former place, you will pass the Pan nannich Wells, already spoken of, and also the hamlet of Ballatrich, where is shown the cottage in which Byron and his mother used to live. Morven and Culbleen will cast their shadow upon you as you go, and remind you once more ofthe poet.

Prince Albert acquired the reversion of the lease in 1848 from the trustees of Sir Robert Gordon, and the estate vvas finally bought for \u00a331,500. \"The castle,\" says Miss Taylor, \" is surrounded by all the varieties of Highland scenery, so that the eye can turn to any of its elements, from the rude to the beautiful, the sternly grand, or where they all unitedly rise into the sublime, while its pure air is invigorating almost to exhila ration. The estate of Balmoral extends from the Dee southwards to the summit of Lochnagar, where it joins the Birkhall and Abergeldie properties. The three estates contain upwards of 35,000 impe rial acres, and extend along the south bank of the Dee for eleven miles.\" On the left bank at this point you see Abergeldie Castle, also a home of royalty, and as we shall not pay it a special visit, we may here say a w7ord or two concerning it. Abergeldie consists of an old square tower with turrets, to which some additions have been made in recent times ; and, after being for some time the residence of the Duchess of Kent, mother of our Queen, it passed at her death into the hands of the Prince of Wales. It forms a comparatively simple dwelling, as one would fancy, for royalty, and is probably from that cause all the more acceptable; whilst its posi tion makes it peculiarly suitable as a centre for shooting excursions. A little way further on is the simple parish church of Crathie, where the \u2022Queen and the lamented Prince Consort used in former times so often to worship together, and where the Queen still fre quently attends. Here some of the greatest Scotch divines have preached during the Queen's visits ; and amongst these probably the one whose dear memory lingers most about the place is Dr. Norman McLeod \u2014 alas 1 a memory only, now. Our readers will remember, perhaps, a passage in Her Majesty's \" Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands,\" in which she refers to his ministrations upon one particular occasion. \"The service was performed by the Rev.

Seen from a distance in the clear moun tain air, it is peculiarly white and beauti ful. One chief feature in the pile of buildings is the large tower, one hundred feet in height, which can be seen a long way off, and which, moreover, it may be added, has in it a clock, which gives time to the whole neighbourhood. As to the arrangement of the interior, the public rooms, dining, drawing, and bil liard rooms, and the library, are on what we call in England the ground floor, while the private or royal apartments are over these. In the entrance-hall stand two fine statues, one of \" Fair Ellen,\" the other of \" Highland Mary ;\" and it may interest some of our lady readers to learn from a lady, whose words we quote, that \" the windows of the dining-room are hung with crimson bordered with Stuart tartan, and the walls with paper of green and gold.\" \"In the drawing-room,\" she adds, \"the hangings are of Victoria tartan : chairs, couches, etc., etc., are all covered with the same. The carpet is of Stuart tartan, and on the walls a paper of blue and gold.

Stories by the Way- was, he met the Italian, who was stalk ing along in great pomp with his drum mer preceding him. As usual, the Italian, or some one in his company, vvas shouting out a challenge to all comers ; but, before it vvas well spoken, Donald had drawn his sword and pierced the drum through and through, saying at the same time, \"Hae deen [have done] wi' yer din.\" The Italian came forward and asked his name. \"Donald Farqu harson of Monaltrie,\" said he; \"and I am ready to meet thee when and how thou desirest.\" OW leaving our centre at Ballater, we propose to make our way to Brae- mar, properly so- called. Our road lies along the north bank of the Dee, and passing round the base of Craig-en-Darroch, crosses the Gairn water ; in deed, it is so far as Balmoral the same road which we have already traversed, and we need not therefore up to that point further refer to it. Passing Balmoral, you soon come to the remains of Monaltrie House, which was burned down after the rising in 1745, and rebuilt as a farm-house. It was here that the redoubtable Donald Oig used to reside. Donald was one of the mighties of his time, and one story is told of him which it may be worth our while to pause in order to relate, x In the course of the evening Donald came across the servant of the Italian, and drew a great deal of information from him which proved of value. He told him that his master was in the ser vice of Satan, and therefore had special protection ; that no man with any iron about him, or standing in leather shoes, could hurt him ; that no sword touched by iron or leather could do him any harm ; and that in fight he vvas accom panied by a shadow on either side, to make his adversary believe that he was fighting with three people. Long-headed Donald did not fail to see that if he could accoutre himself in a style which would suggest to the Italian that he was not weakened by either the influence of iron or leather, he would have a signal ad vantage ; and the night was spent in preparing his peculiar dress. Morning came, and the two valiants met: Donald with his strange costume, the Italian full of vaunting as usual, and seemingly ac companied by two associates. The two men rushed at each other; and Monaltrie, knowing that the other two were mere shadows, devoted his attention undi videdly to the champion. After a lono and terrible fight, Donald's sword was thrust into the champion's side. It was in A certain Italian champion had come to London boasting great things; he vvas a fighter, a wizard, a magician, a necromancer. Defying every brave man in the country to face him, he vvas chal lenged by one and another to fight, and in every case was victorious. He there upon took \u2014 if possible \u2014 still greater airs upon him, and lived in London en prince; indeed, so mighty was his air that even the king was kept in perpetual fear. The city offered a measure of gold to any one who should join successfully with him in combat, but no one could be found. At last the king heard of Donald Oig, who vvas then staying in London, as one who was strong enough and brave enough to enter the lists with the Italian, and a message was immediately de spatched to him. Now it so happened that on the way as Donald vvas going to see the king and learn what his desire"], [431, "BALLATER TO BRAEMAR. 411 vain that the latter shou ted, \" Withdraw thy sword,\" for Donald had been warned by the servant that if the sword was once withdrawn, the champion's wound would instantly heal. The only reply that he would vouchsafe vvas, \" Let the spit go with the roast,\" and in another moment the Italian fell dead at his feet, saying as he fell, \"The Devil has kept ill faith with me.\" * fence of their clan. Such is the origin of the name Cairn-a-Quheen, as told by Miss Taylor. We now pass Inver, and cross the Bridge of Invercauld \u2014 the New Bridge, for the old one leads into a road through the forest of Ballochbuie, which is now to a considerable extent private. It would be, however, worth your while to pursue your journey as far as you can along this latter path to get some idea of the forest itself, which has been described as \"a grand amphitheatre of woods,\" and as \" probably the finest ex ample of a forest in Great Britain.\" Moreover, you will get a sight of the beautiful Falls of Garrawalt, and in these, as they make their little leaps there, sparkling and glancing the while under the rays of the sun which reach them through the branches of the fir and the birch which overhang them, you will own that you have had a picture vvell repaying you for going a little bit out of your way to see it. The gold was now brought forward and presented to Donald, who did not hesitate to take it : and why should he ? Had he not earned it well, and had he not achieved what no Englishman had been able to do ? No matter, there must be some insolent Cockney in the crowd to shout, \" See how the Scots beggar pockets our English gold.\" Just enough to take what he believed to be his due reward, Monaltrie was also proud enough to throw the money to the winds rather than brook the insult to his country. He flung the gold amongst the crowd, whereupon there was a gene ral scramble, and Monaltrie shouted, \"See how the English dogs gather up the gold which they could not win them selves, but a Scot won for them! \" Returning to the road again, you have just passed the bridge a little way when you come to the \"Big Stone of Cluny,\" which used to be regarded as a regular resort of the fairies ; and at the same point you have on your left the granite peak of Craig-Cluny, which rises up sheer from the road, and in its grey majesty seems to frown upon you as you pass. Some way up this hill are the remains of a tower, which is called the \"Laird of Cluny's Charter Chest,\" from the tradition that in old times Cluny used for safety to hide his \" deeds \" here. In the same range of hills is that called \" Lion's Face,\" a great pillar of quartz w7hich takes its name from its supposed likeness to the face of the \" king of the beasts.\" And just opposite to it is In vercauld House, the older part of which was built four hundred years ago, and which claims a place in history as being the house from which the Earl of Mar dated his address to the clans in the rebellion of 1715. Itself a striking So far for Monaltrie and its laird of the earlier half of the sixteenth century. We must now, having, as it were, halted to tell our story, move on once more. A little way further on we come to Cairn-a- Quheen, \" the Cairn of Remembrance,\" the formation of which appears to have been on this wise. In all times of danger, the Clan Farquharson used to meet at a particular spot close by where the cairn stands, each man bringing a stone with him. The stones were laid down in a heap while the clansmen went to battle with the foe; and, at the end of the fray, those who survived came back to the heap and took up each a stone. The remaining stones represented those who had fallen in the strife, and were, as such, reverently placed on the central cairn, which thus came to be a memorial to all the brave hearts that had fallen in de-"], [432, "412 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. building, it is more distinguished for its splendid situation, with the Lion's Face over against it, with the Forest of Bal lochbuie stretching away from it into the distance, and with lines of hills behind it covered with plantations of pine. Hills and woods arc everywhere about you as you stand on the terrace upon which it is built; the lawn stretches away down to the very bank of the river ; and you do not wonder as you recall the fact that the simple folk here about fancied they were in one of the provinces of Fairyland. The road here is all along indeed simply charming beyond all description, for here you have not only the hard grey glory of Highland hills, but the softness also of the dark green woods and the gently winding river. vvas burnt down towards the end of the sixteenth century). At that date it was rebuilt, at the expense of Government, for the purpose of overawing the Far quharson race, as at that time they were the most powerful chiefs in this part of the Highlands \u2014 peculiarly 'their country.' When it was rebuilt, a rampart en closing a considerable portion of ground was added. But neither the rampart nor the modern portion of the building make any pretensions to the massive proportions of the early part, though it is supposed that, so far as outline is con cerned, the original plan vvas pretty closely followed.\" It is in front of this castle that the famous Highland games are held every year \u2014 games of which most of the English world have by this time heard, and which very many have at some time or another seen. We soon reach Braemar Castle, which one guide-book describes as a \" tall, plain, white-washed building,\" having \" neither antiquity nor history to recom mend it;\" while another speaks of it as \"a high, bare- walled tower of recent erection.\" In its present form, indeed, it is of recent erection, but it is the re presentative of a much more venerable mansion. The accomplished authoress of \"The Braemar Highlands\" \u2014 to whom we have had in this portion of the book so frequently to own our obliga tions \u2014 quotes a description of the castle written by a \" Braemarian,\" which is worth quoting here : \u2014 Everybody will remember the pleasant sketch which her Majesty gives in her \"Journal\" of this Braemar gathering, as she saw it in the year 1850. There are contests of various kinds \u2014 -\"putting the stone,\" a game in which the players take a heavy stone, and holding it up on their hands, deliver rather than throw it ; \" throwing the hammer ; \" \" throwing the caber; \" and running a race up the hill called Craig-Cheunnich. The last, as here described, must indeed be rather a pretty sight, from the various-coloured kilts (differing according to clan) worn by those engaged in the contest. Pro bably it may be thought that now this gathering is not what it used to be\u2014 not so simple and so natural, and therefore not so like the country whose native pastime it is. But in this it has but shared the fate of all artless amusement that has become popular, nay, even of its own home of Braemar, which, not long ago so quiet and unpretending in style, is now, as we have hinted, during its brief season, amongst the gayest of summer resorts. \"One of the most interesting objects in the wide domain which once pertained to the proud and powerful Earl of Mar, is the Old Castle. Its situation is beau tiful almost beyond description, and curious, too, from being built on the top of an isolated knoll in the centre of the great park at the foot of Kenneth' s Craig. It was originally one of the hunting \u2022-.eats of these Earls, and was built at a time when thick and substantial walls had greater charms than airy rooms and large windows. Previous to 1715 it had in a great measure fallen to ruins (it We are now at Castleton of Braemar,"], [433, "BALLATER TO BRAEMAR. 413 lesser and more genial hills of Glengairn, with Balmoral away beyond. On lower slopes of the hill other views await you, chiefly the valley of the Dee. And here we cannot refrain from quoting from the writer to whom we have already referred, a description of this view of Deeside : \u2014 \" If it is August, the hills are draped in rich crimson, contrasting beautifully with the dark green of the stately pine, or the lighter shades of the graceful birch. And then, in the depths of the valley, amid the deep, rich, al most transparent green which fills up the centre, the Dee winds gracefully, flash ing back the light like a long wavy line of burnished silver. If it is autumn, the drapery of the hills is a rich colouring of brown, in all its variety of tints, which, w'ith the green and sparkle beneath, produces a singular effect. If it is winter, they are grand beyond descrip tion, as they assume such a defiant ap pearance. Theirs is then stem grandeur; but it is grandeur, and the magnificence of it!\" a \"straggling collection of houses and huts,\" not much ofa \"ton,\" or \"town,\" then, though there be many more re gular \"collections of houses\" which see less of royalty in a generation than does this clachan at the junction of the Clunie torrent with the Dee in the course of a brief summer. Very \"straggling\" indeed it is, but very fair in its setting, nearly hemmed in as it is with mountains and forests, and rich in the nearness of the aforesaid Clunie torrent, which \"rushes down to join the Dee, through a rocky ravine, fringed with copse, and crossed by a bridge, forming a picturesque piece of torrent scenery.\" It stands 1, 1 80 feet above the level of the sea, and here indeed you breathe probably the purest air in Scotland, perhaps in Britain; and, if it were only somewhat farther away from home, and therefore more inaccessible to the worries of one's daily toil, it might more successfully compete than it does with many Continental places of resort. But we fear it has another drawback besides this proxi- mity; it is, we fancy, a very expensive place of residence ; the shrewd residents \"lay it on,\" and many prefer to take to places less haunted by the courtier and the tourist, or, on the other hand, to spend their money in going further a- field. Even as it is, however, Braemar finds itself probably as popular as it cares to be. Go to the Linn of Dee, and come home by way of the Linn of Quoich, getting, during your walk or drive, a view of the Aberdeenshire Grampians in succession. And if you are a specially good climber, you must not be content till you have stood on the summit of Ben Muich-dhui, which stands nearly 4,300 feet above sea-level, and which presents a view of mountains which is singular in its magnificence. These, however, are but a few out of the many excursions to be made from Castleton through the Braemar country. Happy are you if you have a long holiday and o-ood weather, and withal a good pair of legs, or failing this last, enough of money in your pockets ; given these, a whole summer may be profitably, pleasantly, and delightfully spent amid the glories of Braemar. We commend to you one or two excursions to be taken from this Castle ton of Braemar. Go to the top of Morrone, the hill behind the village, in whose nooks and corners the snow lies till Midsummer's day; on its height you will feel yourself under the spell of the everlasting hills.

Beyond this we soon find ourselves steaming through the wild and bare Moor of Din- net, and in a few minutes more we are at Aboyne, near to which is the ancient Castle of Aboyne, described as a \" heavy and not very picturesque building.\" The surroundings of the village are very pretty, set as it is in the midst of trees, and contrasting pleasantly with the moor across which the traveller has just passed. It is supposed from its situation that the castle may have been built about the tenth or eleventh century, but no record of its earliest history is to be found. It need scarcely be said that in its present form it is almost entirely a new edifice, having been repaired in 1671 by the first Earl of Aboyne, and greatly enlarged in 1801 by the Marquis of Huntly, his great-grandson. Aboyne is not without its legendary lore, and we may, by way of example, quote the following story regarding a well in its neighbourhood : \u2014 \" It is said that, at some very remote period, an irruption had been made through the Grampians by an overwhelming host of invaders; that these were assailed by the natives from the woods, rocks, and hills, and finally routed at Knockice ; that a line of tumuli and cairns marks the graves of fallen Danes and northern marauders; that Macbeth fled from Dunsinane, and maintained himself for three years among the fastnesses of Mar; and that, inoneofhisflightsforlife, and unattended, through Aboyne \u2014 himself exhausted and his mare jaded \u2014 he dismounted to drink from a vvell situated at the point from which he could first see his castle of Peel Bog, distant about two miles, and ob taining a bit of bread from a herd-boy, asked him the name of the well, and being told that it was Brien, he ejacu lated, ' Woe is me ! the spell is gone, and my doom is sealed.' \" In the neighbourhood of Aboyne is a hill called the Red-cap of Mortlock, with which the curious tradition is associated that a wild spirit used to wander about the top of it, howling out unknown words in an unknown tongue, and wearing a red night-cap on its head! Taking train again from Aboyne, we reach, five miles further on, the station of Lumphanan, near to which are two objects of interest. The one is the Peel Bog already referred to, an earth work about eighteen feet high and a hundred and twenty round, which is supposed to have been made about the tenth century; the other is \" Macbeth's Cairn.\" Both places are associated with this ancient hero, for tradition says that at the former he made his last stand, while at the latter he was slain by Macduff in the year 1056. Macbeth's history is supposed by many to have in it much that is mythical ; but even the historian Burton, who was not wont to be led away by mere legendaryfancies, considers that the popular belief in Lumphanan as the scene of Macbeth's death has \" unusual claims on our toleration.\" 1 Who does not remember the terrible scene that"], [435, "ON THE WAY BY ABOYNE TO ABERDEEN. 415 was thus probably enacted here, as it has been portrayed for us by our im mortal dramatist? Macduff and Mac beth meet, and the latter \u2014 referring to the strange story of his birth \u2014 says : \u2014 in several ways, is said to have leaped across it in trying to evade his pursuers. But there is not very much to arrest yourat tention further till you come to Banchory Ternan, about seventeen miles from Aberdeen. Here you might well spend a week, and we are sure that \u2014 given fine weather, that rather doubtful commodity in the North \u2014 it would be a pleasant one. There is no end of walks in the vicinity, now by the river-side, now up the hill slopes, now in the shady woods. The fairest spot in the neighbourhood is held to be the Bridge of Feugh, where \" the water falls over the rocks in miniature cascades, and the salmon may be seen leaping with praiseworthy industry to gain the upper portion of the stream.\" Leaving Banchory, a journey of two miles and a-half brings us to Crathes, with its Castle, of which the square tower, with its turrets, is of considerable antiquity ; and five miles further on is Drum, which also boasts of a noble castle, parts of which are not less, pro bably, than 600 years old. This place has been for generations the home ofthe Irvines, a7 family still of high standing, but not so conspicuous in the annals of the country as it vvas four or five hundred years ago. In 141 1 Sir Alexander Ir vine fell in the Battle of Harlaw, a place so close to Drum that Burton speaks of his domains as \" almost touching the field of battle,\" fitly adding that his \"square tower would have been among the first to endure a siege.\" Perhaps the William Irvine, the non-juring min ister, who preached before the army of Mar and Derwentwater in the rising ot 1715, and was evidently a man of some note in his time, was also of this family. \"Thou losest labour ; As easy may'st thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield To one of woman born, \" Macduff hears all, and then tells him that his charm is of no avail, since he vvas taken from his mother, and there fore Macbeth is not exempt from de struction athishands. Upon thisMacbeth begins to falter, and even declines to sight; but, upon Macduff s baiting him for a coward, he rallies, and replies : \u2014 \" I will not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, And to be baited with the rabble's curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last ; before my body I throw my warlike shield : lay on, Macduff.\" The scuffle ends \u2014 how, we know; and we next see Macduff approaching Mal colm Canmore with Macbeth's head on a pole, while he hails the former as king, and bids him \" Behold, where stands Th' usurper's cursed head.\" Such a scene was it of which may hap the spot on which stands the Cairn of Macbeth vvas witness \u2014 a spot thence forward, therefore, worthy of mark as that at which, according to our great dramatist, Tyranny struggled in deathly throes with Liberty and Power, and was ignominiously overcome.

The fact that it did not come into greater political and national pro minence may be partly accounted for by the fact that it was so far north, and partly from the curiously cosmopolitan character which it seems in early times to have borne. From the position of the town, its port formed a natural haven for vessels from England and France, from Denmark and Scandinavia, and we are told that \"in the fourteenth cen tury the dialect spoken in the town vvas a singular mixture of Gaelic, Saxon, Danish, British, and French,\" and that \" it was not till a subsequent epoch that the English language assumed a com plete superiority.\" Perhaps to this circumstance we may also trace the well-known fact that, at the time of the Reformation, Aberdeen did not fall in so readily with the revolt from Romanism as did the southern towns. Romanism, indeed, seems to have had a great hold upon the city; and the fashion of religious dramas was, in its time, greatly in vogue here.

Boece speaks of it as having attained to the rank of a burgh in the 9th century, but the evidence for this is rather indistinct ; of its burghal status what we do know is that it attained to the dignity of a royal burgh in the reign of William the Lion, about 1179. From this date we cannot follow its varied fortunes here ; suffice it to say that it seems to have taken a fair share though not a remarkable share \u2014 in the events which marked the changing for- respectively of Bon Accord (the city motto), and these were set to preside over the plays, which were, as we know, often of the most unhallowed description. It is of these plays that Scott says: \" Few"], [437, "ABERDEEN. 417 readers can be ignorant, that at an early period, and during the plenitude of her power, the Church of Rome not only connived at, but even encouraged such saturnalian licenses .... and that the vulgar, on such occasions, were not only permitted, but encouraged, by a number of gambols, sometimes puerile and ludicrous, sometimes immoral and profane, to indemnify themselves for the privations and penances imposed on them at other seasons. But, of all other topics for burlesque and ridicule, the rites and ceremonial of the Church itself were most frequently resorted to ; and, strange to say, with the approbation of the clergy themselves.\" activity, such as that, though printing was very late in being established in thecity, it was no sooner established almost than it was made a means of unique gain ; for Aberdeen became the producer of the first almanacs that were printed in Scot land, and the demand for these became simply immense. It may also be added in the same connection that it produced the first northern Scottish newspaper, the Aberdeen Journal, and again vindi cated its constitutional shrewdness by issuing its first number just after the battle of Culloden in 1746. Marked as it was so exceptionally for business capa city, it may seem to the superficial mind curious that it should have early show7n an interest in music; but in this it only resembled the once busy town of Nuremberg, in Germany, which found time in the days of Hans Sachs to devote much attention to this noble art. A school for music existed in Aberdeen so early as 1475. Such, then, was the kind of recreation which the Church had taught the early Aberdonians to approve and practice, and we need scarcely wonder if, when the time of the Reformation came, they were so deteriorated, morally and spiritu ally, as to see no particular need of, and have no particular desire for it. And it is worthy of note that even long after the Protestant faith had begun to have a hold here as elsewhere, the loose habits which had been earlier formed remained. Aberdeen became conspi cuous for conviviality, and such oc casions as that of a baptism were seized upon as special opportunities for drunkenness and revelry. This fact shows well enough that, though Aberdeen had not specially identified itself with some of the greater movements of the Scottish people, it vvas not because the people were entirely immersed in commerce; and this be comes still more evident when we remember that it has for centuries been a great centre for learning, and has boasted two noble colleges \u2014 Marischal College and King's College. Having slowly received the Protestant faith, and having retained its lively character, the sober views of the Cove nanters seem to have found little favour in the city; and in 1638 the inhabitants positively refused to have anything to do with the Solemn League and Covenant. Before proceeding to speak of Aber deen's chief buildings, let us say a word or two generally about its chief street. In Union-street Aberdeen possesses a noble avenue \u2014 one which, we are free to say, our own metropolis would be glad to have. Stretching, as it does, for nearly a mile east and west, with its banks, shops, hotels, and dwelling houses, all built of solid granite, it pre sents an appearance of wealth, strength, and beauty, which we have not seen anywhere surpassed, or indeed even equalled. The statue of Queen Victoria, by William Brodie, and the handsome But while thus keeping aloof of old from the higher movements of the national mind and soul, Aberdeen seems to have borne, from very early times, that character for commercial strength which it still possesses. In the time of Charles I. it was spoken of as a \"little London\" on this account. And there are some curious evidences of its general"], [438, "418 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. building in which the East and West Churches meet, are worthy of special notice. Toward its western end the street crosses the low portion named the Denburn, by a fine bridge, of course of granite, the single span of which it con sists being 131 feet in width; and further on is Marochetti's fine statue of Prince Albert, which the Queen came in person to unveil. The author of \"The Land We Live In \" gives a lively description of this street, which we are fain to quote. He says : \u2014 \" It possesses all the stability, cleanliness, and architectural beauties of our own London West-end streets, with the gaiety and brilliancy of the Parisian atmosphere. We could have imagined ourselves transported to a continental capital upon a bright May day, The lofty, elegant houses, the beautifully white, flowing muslin curtains in the first and second-floor windows, the expanded shop fronts, set out with such a profusion of rich and costly wares, made all Union street seem one continuous bazaar or fancy fair. Almost every other shop appeared to be either a confectioner's or a jewel ler's; and it was difficult to say which of these wore the most brilliant appear ance The same strange mixture of dress and dialect, which had first struck us on landing as so foreign, still met our eye and ear in this mid-day ramble through the city. Ladies in gayest, most fashionable attire, jostled against stockingless, shoeless girls of sixteen, and women in tall Flemish caps and foreign-looking ear-rings. Dashing young advocates and M.D.'s walked behind raw Scotch porters, with strange caps on their heads, and queer burthens slung on their backs, or made way for an occasional stalwart Highlander, in his picturesque costume.\" must, by the order of our arrangement, speak of the former first, although it is considerably more recent in date than its sister college. It was founded by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal, and was built upon the site of a convent belonging to the Franciscan order, which was founded about 1471. It appears that about the beginning of the sixteenth century, the monks, fearing the ravages of the party which vvas engaged in the dissolution of the religious houses, thought it wise rather to dispossess them- selves than to be dispossessed, and handed over the place to the magis- trates; and it was by this party that, in 1593, it vvas \" votit, thocht guid and expedient, that the Greyfriars place thereof sal be resignit in favouris of ane nobill and potent Lord George Erll Merchell, Lord Keith and Altri, to be giffen to the said Erll, to be ane College, according to his institution and erectioun thairof.\" The charter vvas drawn up April 2, 1593. For nearly a hundred years after, this time the old building was used for collegiate purposes, but toward the close of the seventeenth century a new building was reared, and this ag-ain gave place, in the year 1837, to the pre sent handsome edifice. It is interesting to know that amongst the distinguished alumni of the college in its earliest dwelling was the famous Bishop Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, whose \"History of His Own Time,\" and \" History of the Reformation \" may almost be character ised as classical English works. Bishop Burnet was not unmindful of the benefits which he had received from his alma mater, and he left a sum of 20,000 merks for the foundation of bursaries in philo sophy and divinity It is not necessary for us to give a long description of the modern building, but we may note the motto on an old stone, taken from the earlier one, placed over the entrance \u2014 Aberdeen, as we have said, is famous as the seat of a university of ancient dignity, consisting of two colleges, Marischal College and King's College, the latter being in \"Old Aberdeen,\" to which we shall refer by-and-by. We THEY HAVE SAID. WHAT DO THEY SAY? LET THEM SAY."], [439, "ABERDEEN 419 This is believed by a recent writer to have been meant as a defiant utterance of the Keith family against those who condemned them for alienating church lands. Whether this be so or no, it may be taken as briefly expressive of a firmness and almost stolid independence which is very thoroughly characteristic ofthe people of Aberdeen. In the hall is a good collection of pictures, chiefly portraits of patrons, early alumni, and the like ; while one writer describes the library \u2014 somewhat partially, perhaps \u2014 as \"a compact apartment, with a pleas ing undisturbed air of tranquillity about it, which would woo the most careless to become a a re-union without effect; the local authorities could not agree as to whether Old Aberdeen or New Aberdeen should have the pre-eminence, and the year 1860 had come before this knotty point was got over, and the incorporation of the two was secured, the Faculties of Arts and Divinity being assigned to King's College, while those of Law and Medicine were to have their home in Marischal College. In the same street (Broad-street) in which stands this college, Lord Byron lived when a boy, and the house (No. 64) in which he dwelt is now a printing office. We can picture to ourselves the little boy, not yet five years old, setting out from this quiet home to Mr. Bowers's school, where he got his \" schooling \" for five shillings a quarter, and to which Moore supposes he was sent less for the sake of learning than to keep him quiet. His own account of his progress there amusingly confirms the supposition. \"1 was sent,\" he says, \" at five years old, or earlier, to a school kept by a Mr. Bowers, who was called ' Bodsy Bowers,' by reason of his dapperness. It was a school for both sexes. I learned little except to repeat by rote the first lesson of monosyllables (' God made man ' \u2014 'Let us love Him ') by hearing it often repeated, without acquiring a letter. Whenever proof was made of my pro gress at home, I repeated these words with the most rapid fluency ; but, on turning over a new leaf, I continued to repeat them, so that the narrow boun daries of my first year's accomplishments were detected, my ears boxed (which they did not deserve, seeing it was by ear only that I had acquired my letters), and my intellects consigned to a new preceptor.\" Haunter of old tomes Sitting the silent term of stars to watch His own thoughts passing into beauty.\" The college has also a fairly good museum ; and from the tower, which is about IOO feet high, but nowise remark able in appearance or architecture, a fine view of the city and neighbourhood is to be obtained. We shall speak of King's College more particularly when we make our way to \" Old Aberdeen \" ; but this is the most convenient point at which to indi cate the relations in which these two stand to each other. Up to the year 1641, they were quite distinct ; but in that year King Charles incorporated the two, by charter, as one, by the name of the Caroline University, and granted the revenues of the see of Aberdeen to the new foundation. This arrangement vvas approved by Parliament, and vvas also, in 1654, confirmed by Cromwell; but the rescissory act of Charles II., the main purpose of which vvas the re establishment of Episcopacy, had the subordinate result of abolishing this union, and renewing a distinction which now appears to have been alike mean ingless and inconvenient. Yet for well nigh two centuries the division remained; once and again attempts were made at Marischal College and Byron's house having now been visited, let us re turn into Union-street, and moving a little way toward the bridge, find our way into Market-street, to visit the scene of the famous \"Markets,\" only recently"], [440, "420 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. a pleasant murmur \u2014 all contribute to compose a scene of business and plenty which it is delightful to contemplate and pleasant to recall.\" burned down. Of these we take the following account from Mr. Cadenhead's excellent little manual, the \"New Book of Bon Accord\": \u2014 \"The building, con- sisting of the great hall, basement-floor, and galleries,\" he asserts, \" is, for vast- ness, with elegance and compactness, allowed on all hands to outrival every other market in the kingdom. The great hall is 315 feet long, and 106 feet broad, with a height of 45 feet, and besides the numerous stalls and benches it contains, is ornamented with a beauti- ful fountain, consisting of three basins of polished Peterhead granite. You are fortunate in coming to see it on a Friday, which is our market-day ; for I am sure you will be delighted to observe the good-looking country girls who occupy the stalls in the centre of the great hall, each with her baskets covered with snow-white napery, from which the rich butter, or fresh translucent eggs peep out in tempting plenty. Aberdeen has been as much celebrated for its butter as Cheshire for its cheese. Sir Walter Scott, who speaks so flatteringly of Finnan haddocks, also alludes to the Laird of Culrossie, who fought a duel for the honour of Aberdeen butter, and who, although worsted in the encounter, after thanking his adversary for his life, added, ' But I'll say yet, that better butter than Aberdeen butter ne'er gaed down a southern thrapple.' The plentiful supply of vegetables, too, with flowers in all their summer beauty, and strawberries in unmatched abundance and excellence, which are piled upon the gardeners' benches, and the great sirloins and huge highly-fed carcasses that hang in the butchers' stalls; down in the base- ment floor the stores of fish, both fresh from the sea and cured in all the diffe rent styles of golden Finnan or silver spelding \u2014 lucken, piper, or pin-the-widdie It vvas, indeed, nothing short of being a terrible calamity when this fine build ing vvas practically reduced to ashes. Coming into Union-street, and return ing upon our steps a little way \u2014 for, be it remembered, we are rather sauntering than making a steady progress through the city\u2014toward the east, we come into Castle-street, where stand the handsome Town and County Buildings, while in front of them is a still more interesting object, the Town Cross. This originally stood in front of the Tolbooth, and was erected in 1686; in former times its arches were filled up, and the economi cal citizens used itvariouslyasa post-office and a coach-office. Now, however, these are left open, the change having been made when the cross was placed in its present position in 1S42. Over the arches are twelve panels, ten of which contain portraits of the kings of the Stuart line, and of Mary Queen of Scots, while the other two bear representations of the royal arms and those of the burgh. Rising from thecentreof thecrossis afine column about which thistles are woven, on the top of which is a unicorn in white marble, bearing a shield \"charged\" with the \"Lion of Scotland.\" Around this cross, and we may say generally within the neighbourhood of Castle-square, many of the interesting incidents in the not very remarkable history of Aberdeen have taken place. Before this cross existed, and when there were two such ensigns in this central part of the town, the \" high \" or \" flesh \" cross, and the \"laigh\" or \"fish\" cross, proclamations used to be made at the former, and there also, on high and holy days, the people kept solemn festival aye, and sometimes festival that was by no means solemn, for we read how that, in 1593, when a son had been born to King James, the magistrates ordered \u2014 with the noise of axe, saw, or cleaver, the fresh sparkle of the fountain as it plays up, purifying and cooling the air, and the hum of bargaining rising up in"], [441, "ABERDEEN. 421 that after the second service on Sunday, February 24th, a table should be set \"for the magistratis and bayth the Consallis, with twa bunnis of Inglis ber, to be placed and run\" at the Market Cross. Several other occasions are men tioned upon which something like a carnival was kept here, but these we need not stay to mention. Enough to say that the sturdy citizens seem to have made it their business to omit no oppor tunity for convivial enjoyment. The following strange scene, of quite another kind, is said to have taken place here in 1640, when Covenanters held the town : \u2014 \"A quarrel having occurred among some gentlemen who were escorting the Earl Marischal, governor of the city, towards Dunnottar, the young laird of Tolquhon was wounded in the head by George Lesly. His lordship instantly disarmed the culprit, and on the next day sent him in irons to Aberdeen, commanding the Provost to strike off his right hand for his breach of military discipline. The chief magistrate,\" so runs the story, \"seems to have declined the execution of this order, and the Marischal pro ceeded to enforce it on his own authority. A small scaffold was erected at the Cross, the axe and block were made ready, and a fire was kindled to heat the instrument for searing the maimed stump. Lesly was then conducted from the Tolbooth, and, descending the stair, amidst the lamentations of the crowd, laid his arm upon the block. The exe cutioner prepared to give the stroke, when the Master of Forbes stepped for ward, and, taking Lesly by the hand, freely pardoned him, to the great joy ot the people.\" she \" tuik him on the chaptis [cheeks] therewith, and plaid herself thereon to the haill companie.\" So much for a few of the incidents which are recorded as having happened in this part of the town ; but we must not linger further over these reminis cences, weird and gay. As our interest in the town \u2014 and pro bably that of most of our readers\u2014 is not commercial, we are not inclined to say much about its harbour, its imports and exports ; and we shall therefore only ask that we may be allowed a few minutes to step aside from the historic neighbourhood of Castle-street and look at the extensive docks which Aberdeen boasts. The harbour, which may be said to extend from the Deeside railway station to the Links, is a monument of the engineering skill of \u2014 amongst others \u2022 \u2014 Smeaton and Telford, and vvas con structed at great cost ; but the trade of the town seems always to have outrun the supply of accommodation thus afforded, and large additions have had to be made to it from time to time. Five years ago Aberdeen possessed some where about 220 vessels of 108,067 tons, and within these last years the number must have largely increased. But we cannot linger here to witness the loading and unloading of ships, or to watch the cautious-looking, shrewd merchants as they linger about the quay, or to note the mixed nationalities of the sailor-folk who are about ; other places would offer us far more interesting studies of this kind, and we return once more to the town. Walking again up Market-street, we cross Union-street, and walk up St. Nicholas-street, passing the East and West Churches, to which we have already referred. There being nothing more of which to take notice in connection with these churches themselves, we may pass them without further remark, save that they are built upon the site of the ancient Cathedral Church of St. Nicholas, the Here, in the days of the trials for witchcraft, some of the accused are said to have practised their arts; one of them having been accused of joining in a devils' dance, and of having, in displea sure, shown her familiarity with Satan by taking the instrument on which he was playing out of his mouth, upon which"], [442, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 422 the withdrawal of which doubtless meant a restraint upon boyish boisterousness. They took the law into their own hands, and we hear of the \"bairnis and scho laris\" taking \"the schuill \" from the master, and demanding, as of ancient time, to have a holiday at \"the tyme of yeir afoir Yuill, called Nativite of our Lord.\" In this struggle, which lasted fitfully for some time, the boys appear to have had some success, and instead of their Christmas holiday they were allowed a few days each quarter. Mr. Cadenhead tells us of a \" grand rumpus \" which took place in 1604, when the scholars not only took possession of the school, but defended their possession with swords, guns, and pistols; and so obstinate did this mutiny become, that recourse had to be taken to imprison ment before it could be put down. But, though the Grammar School lost caste to some extent through these perpetual squabbles, it has earned an undying fame upon other and better grounds. Many famous men have had part of their early education in this school, and it must especially be said that many of those who afterwards earned distinction patron saint of the city. The latter is supposed to have been commenced as early as 1060, and the choir was built in the latter half of the fifteenth century. Any one who is inclined to study curiosi ties of epitaphic literature, might do well to linger awhile in the graveyard here ; he will find amongst other graves to be noted that of Dr. Beattie, author of \"The Minstrel,\" and. if he chances to come across the following inscription over the -rave of an unknown sailor, he will feel That his visit has not been made in vain : \u2014 Though Boreas' blasts and Neptune's waves Have tossed me to and fro, In spite of both, by God's decree, I harbour here below ; Where at an anchor I do lie With many of our fleet, Till once again we do set sail, Our admiral, Christ, to meet, Turning now somewhat to the west wards, we make our way up the \" School Hill \" to the famous Grammar School \u2014 one of the glories of Aberdeen. The present building only dates from 1757, but the school goes back to a much earlier date, mention of it being made so early as the year 1418, when the Vicar of Bervie, Andrew de Syves, who had been master for some time, died. We learn that in 1479 the master's salary vvas \u00a35 Scots ; but in 1670 things were certainly two centuries better, for the rector's salary had risen to 600 merks, while he had under him three ushers, each receiving 200 merks and fees. Nowadays we trust the learned men who preside over this valuable institution have fallen upon even better times. The school has been famous as the intellec tual nursery of great scholars ; but it is curious to find that in olden times it had quite another kind of celebrity, and that of a kind by no means so creditable. It seems that at the time of the Reformation certain privileges were withdrawn from the boys, which they were determined to retain \u2014 privileges, in the University, and later in the great world of letters, owed the first motions of their enthusiasm for classical and other learning to the training which they received in this grammar school. So much is this the case, that one has grown familiar with its name simply through the testimonies one has seen again and again in the biographies of eminent Northerners of the benefits which it con ferred upon them in . early youth. Amongst these we do not k-novv that Lord Byron could be very fitly reckoned; but we cannot refer to the school with out referring also to the fact that he studied here, \"threading through all the classes,\" as he says, \" to the fourth.\" It does not seem that he showed much am bition to excel in classical lore, and Moore remarks that he was much more eager for distinction \" by prowess in all"], [443, "ABERDEEN. 423 sports and exercises, than by advance ment in learning.\" He adds: \u2014 \"Though quick, when he could be persuaded to attend, or had any study that pleased him, he was, in general, very low in the class, nor seemed ambitious of being promoted any higher. It is the custom, ib seems, in this seminary, to invert, now and then, the order of the class, so as to make the highest and lowest boys change places, with a view, no doubt, of piquing other departments than those which we principally associate with school. Here, also, it is said that Dr. Beattie, the poet, gained part of his earlier educa tion, and for about two years he acted in the capacity of usher, passing from this to the honourable position of Pro fessor of Moral Philosophy in Marischal College in the year 1760. His connec tion with the grammar school, we may remark, had an important bearing upon A \"HARBOUR HERE BELOW.\" his after life, for Mary Dun, the daughter of the rector, became his wife in the year 1767. Close by this institution, and almost dwarfing it into at least external insigni ficance, is Gordon's Hospital, an institution founded by one Robert Gordon, who had made his fortune in Danzig, and, returning to his native land, spent his closing years in the most miserly fashion. He left all his property for the endow- the ambition of both. On these occa sions, and only these, Byron was some times at the head, and the master, to banter him, would say, ' Now, George, man, let me see how soon you'll be at the foot again.' \" In the same connection we learn that he vvas a good hand at marbles, and that he was distinguished by his proficiency at a game called \" Bases \" ; just as in our own time boys who \"O to Eton win honours in quite"], [444, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 424 thereof, in curious work, under the ceil ing at the west end of the pend whereon the great steeple stands unmoved till now ; and, besides, where there were any crucifixes set in glass windows, those they pull out in honest men's houses.

It is a small place, about a mile or little more from New Aberdeen, \u2014 so small that we find one w7riter \u2014 probably from somewhere about Bow Bells \u2014 calling it a village, perhaps from lofty ignorance of the fact that we do not usually designate as villages places which possess a cathedral and a college. It must be admitted, however, that it has not been for many a day much more than a village in size, with a few houses of some pretension. Even yet, however, notwithstanding all these calamities, the cathedral church has great grandeur about it. Its western entrance, with its fine window, is speci ally notable; the work is all of granite, and represents masonry executed at various times from 1357 to 15 18. Equally noteworthy is the ceiling of panelled oak, with forty-eight shields, bearing on them the arms of the Pope, the emperor, St. Margaret, and many kings, princes, bishops, and earls. Even our friend who talks of the \" village,\" and compares the scenery around it unfavourably with that of Surrey and Kent, is moved to unbounded admiration at the sight of the old cathedral, whose \"fine old win dows, ponderous doors, with the massive character of the edifice, all give it a charm that more costly decorations would have failed to bestow.\" The Cathedral is dedicated to St. Machar, an obscure saint about whom we know nothing save that he vvas a companion of St. Columba. It was founded about 1378 by Bishop Alexander Kyninmundie, and was completed about 1552 under Bishop Gavin Dunbar. It consists now only of the noble nave, which is used as the parish church, it 1 eing understood that the choir was destroyed at the time of the Reformation, and that the transepts were destroyed by the falling of the central tower, which was undermined by Cromwell's men. Us the work done by the fierce icono clasts of Reformation times, an old- Lshioned writer gives an interestino account: \u2014 \"They came all,\" he says, *' riding up to the gate of St. Machar's Kirk, ordained our blessed Lord Jesus Cnriist his arms to be cut out ofthe fore front of the pulpit thereof, and to take down the portraiture of the blessed Virgin Mary and our Saviour in her arms, that had stood since the up-puttin^ Let us not forget to add that John Barbour, the early poet of \"The Bruce,\" lies buried here. He was Archdeacon of Aberdeen in the year 1357, and he probably remained in this office till the time of his death. His poem of \" The Bruce \" is known but to the few, and many Scotchmen there are who know nothing either about it or him. We may be par doned for quoting here (for the sake of those who do not know aught of him) his noble apostrophe to Freedom (in a modernised form) as showing how rich a gift Scotland had and has in him : \u2014 Ah, freedom is a noble thing, And can to life a relish bring."], [445, "ABERDEEN. 425 Freedom all solace to man gives ; He lives at ease that freely lives. A noble heart may have no ease, the canopied stalls, the miserere seats. and the screen. Bishop Stuart's pulpil is also here, with its representation of the heads of the Scottish sovereigns ofthe Stuart dynasty; and on the floor are monuments to Bishop Elphinstone and to Boece. The College possesses a large and valuable library, containing some fine missals and interesting manu scripts. Nor aught beside that may it please, If freedom fail \u2014 for 'tis the choice, More than the chosen, man enjoys. Ah, he that ne'er yet lived in thrall, Knows not the weary pains which gall The limbs, the soul, of him who 'plains In slavery's foul and festering chains ; If these he knew, I ween right soon He would seek back the precious boon Of freedom, which he then would prize More than all wealth beneath the skies. Boece, the famous historian, vvas its first principal, having come hither from Paris at the invitation of Bishop Elphin stone, in the year 1500 ; and it is from the pen of Boece that we have one ofthe most interesting and minute descriptions of the chapel extant. His salary does not appear to us to have been munificent, but forty merks\u2014 or \u00a32 3s. 4d. sterling a-year; and even though times have changed, and ways of living, too, very wondrously since then, we suspect that even for that time it did not mean very much, especially for a man who was destined, by his great ability and marvellous diligence in literary labour, to live down through the centuries as an annalist and a biographer. In the near neighbourhood of the Cathedral, a little to the south, is King's College, of which we have already spoken in connection with Marischal College. It was founded in the year 1494 at the suggestion of Bishop Elphin stone, and in accordance with a Bull issued by Pope Alexander VI. It gives us a strange picture of things as they were in those old times to study the reasons assigned for the foundation of this new seat of learning \u2014 \"that the inhabitants were igmorant of letters, and almost uncivilised ; that there were no persons to be found fit to preach the Word of God to the people, or to administer the Sacraments ofthe Church, and, besides, that the country was so intersected with mountains and arms of the sea, or distant from the universities already erected, and the roads so dan gerous, that the youth had not access to Lie benefit of education in these semi naries.\" The buildings were begun in 150S, and the college vvas framed as to its constitution upon the model of the University of Paris. The oldest parts now in existence are the chapel and the adjoining tower, on the top of which is a crown similar to that upon the towers of the cathedral churches of St. Giles, Edinburgh, and St. Nicholas, Newcastle o;i-Tyne. No doubt, in early days, it was a very noble building, and even now all accounts agree in testifying to its beauty. The chapel has a \" Flam boyant \" western window7, and it pos sesses some finely-carved woodwork in In early days King's College (first called \" St. Mary's,\" by the way) seems to have had a prosperous career. But with the Reformation reverses came. Probably the reason for this was that its leading men did not move with the times toward a purer faith. In the seventeenth century, however, its fortunes somewhat revived, and some thing of its ancient glory vvas restored to it, chiefly through the exertions of Bishop Forbes; and in 1620 a professor ship of divinity vvas added to its founda tion, the first occupant of the new chair being Dr. Forbes, a son of the bishop, and a man who seems to have borne a lofty character Again dark days came, for once more in a crisis of the nation's religious history, some of the chief men, and amongst them this same Dr. Forbes, were out of sympathy with the people holding aloof from p"], [446, "426 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. the noble movement symbolised by the Solemn League and Covenant; and Principal Leslie, Forbes, and others were expelled from their chairs. The suc cessors of these men were again expelled by Cromwell and his party, who, though against Episcopacy, were not of the same school with many of the Scotch eighteenth century witnessed another expulsion of professors, and this time the reason vvas that they were suspected of sympathy with the dethroned house of Stuart. After passing thus through a chequered course, King's College has now, as we have seen, settled down into a calm and honourable existence as one \"THE FAMILY BURIAL-PLACE.\" Covenanters; but once more, at the Restoration, things were placed upon the old basis, and the College was again prosperous. These changes point to the curious fact that King's College seems only to have been firm in its posi tion when the prelatical system, with which the rest of Scotland had so little sympathy, was in the ascendant. The ofthe twin colleges of Aberdeen Univer sity ; and it possesses the happy distinc tion of having trained some of the finest classical scholars whom Scotland has produced. To know, indeed, that a man has got his classical training here, is almost enough of itself to stamp him as efficient. In visiting Old Aberdeen, after seeing"], [447, "ABERDEEN. 427 the Cathedral and the College, the chief object of interest to be noted is the old Bridge of Don, better known in litera ture as the \" Brig o' Balgownie.\" It consists of a wide Gothic arch, stretching between the rocks on either side of the river. At the top it is pointed as a Gothic window would be, and it dates from the time of Robert the Bruce, hav ing been reared either by the hero himself, or by Bishop Cheyne, during his reign. This bridge is described fitly as being of \" uncommonly stout architec ture,\" its span being sixty-seven feet, and its height above the river thirty-four feet and a-half. Lord Byron has cele brated it, and to him we owe an indica tion of an old saw regarding it : \u2014 \u25a0 no words in which to celebrate it, for William Douglas, as quoted by the writer of the \"Book of Bon Accord,\" passes upon it the following eulogium : \u2014 Apelles stareing long, did loot upon The Learning, Policy, and Generous mind Of that Brave City, plac'd 'twixt Dee and Done ; But how to paint it, he could never find ; For still he stood, in judging which of three, A Court, a Colledge, or a Burgh, it be. The last poetical quotation w7e give is from that wandering star of our modern sky, Lord Byron, who, for all that his \" English Bards and Scotch Reviewers\" might seem to prove to the contrary, clung with a strong tenacity of affection to the home of his boyhood : \u2014 Brig o' Balgownie, though wight be your wa', Wi'a wife's ae son, and a meare's ae foal, Down ye shall fa'.

We shall close our references to it by quoting some lines regarding it. The first which we quote are from the poet Dunbar, \"the darling of the Scottish Muses\" : \u2014 Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall, Like Banquo's offspring ; \u2014 floating past me seems My childhood in this childishness of mine ; I care not \u2014 't is a glimpse of \" Auld Lang Syne.\" It may somewhat help to soften some of the hard things said about the Northern city, the jokes passed upon its canniness, and the painful thoughts called up in the mind of an enthusiastic Aber donian by the discovery, for example, that such a man as Dr. Johnson seems to have grown rapturous over little in the place but its famous \"broth\" \u2014 thus to see that the Muses have had many kind and loving things to say of the fine Granite City on the banks of Dee and Don.

Such vvas the lofty estimate\u2014 touched somewhat with poetic licence \u2014 formed by a poet of the 15th century. Two centuries later it seems that poesy found Po"], [448, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 428 A SWAKE WITHIN THE SeA,\" building vvas reared; but from a re ference to it in Buchanan's history as being \"sufficiently manned and forti fied,\" and as being reduced by Wallace, we are able to fix its existence with some probability at a date anterior to that oC the hero. Tradition assigns to the tower a Pictish origin, but this is based upon mere conjecture. In the year 165 1 it was attacked by Cromwell's men, and its little garrison held out bravely for six months, the governor, Ogilvy, only yielding when famine and mutiny made it impossible longer to keep possession. Shortly before this date the Scotch Regalia had been placed in safe keep ing in Dunnottar Castle, but at length, when one fortress after another was being taken, fears began to arise as to the safety even of Dunnottar, and they were removed. The plan of their removal vvas formed by two clever women, one the wife of the commander, the other the wife of Mr. Granger, minister of the parish. The latter carried them through the opposing army \u2014 the crown in her lap, the sword and sceptre, says Burton, as \" a sort of distaff for a mass of lint which, like a thrifty Scots matron, she was busy spinning into thread.\" The precious ensigns of royalty were laid for the time under the floor of the church, and there they remained till quieter and happier times. N making our way to Aberdeen we chose to go through the High- lands rather than to come along the coast; and now, havinggone ourway through wild Glenesk and Glenlee, having beheld the glories of the Braemar Highlands, and so come and viewed the old and somewhat stern UniversityCity ofthe North with the fresh life of the Highlands in every pulse, we are glad that we did take the course we did. Yet it was im possible that we should not thus forego a visit to certain places well worth see ing, and amongst these perhaps the most notable is the ancient castle of Dunnottar. Happily, however, this omis sion can be rectified by supposing that ere we move northwards from Aberdeen, we take train to Stonehaven, which is only fifteen miles away, and from it visit the castle which is in its vicinity. But time grows short as we think how much of Scotland has yet to be travelled ever ; and all that we can do is just, as it were, to stand by Dunnottar, and tell its story as briefly as we can. The castle stands about a mile and a-half to the south of Stonehaven, exactly upon the sea. The ruins \" occupy an area of be tween four and five acres on the top of a precipitous rock, separated by a deep ehasm from the mainland, and almost surrounded by the sea. The great tower, still nearly entire, and the ranges ef buildings adapted to the various pur poses of a garrisoned place, present in their majestic position and bold and varied outline, an object at once grand and picturesque.\" There seems some doubt as to the date at which this noble A sad reminiscence of this ancient place is to be found in the fact that here men, women, and children, over a hun dred in all, belonging to the Covenant ing party, were imprisoned in 16S5. They were shut up in a dungeon, called the \"Whigs' Vault\" from this fact, and here, it is said, they had to endure great torture at the hands of the governor, Keith of Whiterigs. It seems that they had been removed from other places of"], [449, "SWAKE WITHIN THE SEA.\" \"A 429 durance lest they should be rescued in the event of the success of Argyle's in surrection ; they had to trudge their weary way, old frail men and feeble women and tender children amongst them, on foot, and on arriving they were shut up, says the author of an old fashioned book, \" above eighty in a room \u2014 men and women \u2014 without air. without ease, and without place either to lie or walk, and without any comfort save what they had from heaven.\" Wodrow mentions a petition which was presented to the Council from the re lations of some of these unhappy prisoners, in which they are represented as being \" in a most lamentable con- dition, there being a hundred and ten of them in one vault where there is little or no daylight at all, and, contrary to all modesty, men and women promiscuously together, and forty-two more in another room.\" It is vain to attempt to deny these, Scotland has stuck with some times intolerant tenacity to the inheri tance of a Covenant, which vvas thus, on the one hand, borne down by ruthless despotism, on the other, glorified by martyred devotion. A word or two must be said concern ing the ancient church and chapel. It is said the original church stood on the rock where the castle now stands, and that it was burned down by Sir William Wallace in 1297, the occasion being the occupation of the spot by the English when they were being driven before Wallace's conquering band. It is sup posed that their reason for betaking themselves to this place vvas that being consecrated ground, they trusted to their enemies regarding it as a sanctuary ; but Wallace was too eager to secure a con quest, and the right of sanctuary \u2014 if right it vvas \u2014 was not regarded.

The remonstrances against the cruelties practised upon these faithful people could not remain unheeded ; those who survived were brought to Edinburgh, and finally many of them, it is believed, were sent into the plantations, only exchanging imprisonment for slavery. How does one recall, as one thinks of such terrible things as these, the words put into the mouth of Isabel by the great dramatist\u2014 The Bishop then began to treaty ma, Their lives to get, out of the land to ga ; But they were rude, and durst not well assy : Wallace in fire gait set all hastily, Burnt up the kirk and all that was therein, Attour the rock, the lave ran with great din, Some hung on crags, right dolefully to dee, Some lap, some fell, some fluttered in the sea, No Southern in life was left in that hold, And them within they burnt to powder cold.

In the family burial- place, called the Howff, or Hans of Ury, upon the highest part of the estate, lie his remains, and an inscription indicates the place of \"the grave of Robert Barclay of Urie, author of the \"Apologie for the Quakers.\" He was a man of one thought and one work, and his holy enthusiasm, combined with his remark- able gifts, constituted him for his own generation, and for all generations to come, one ofthe chief exponents of the tenets of a sect to which it may also be said that his character has been a tower of strength. The churchyard is interesting as con- taining the tomb of the Covenanters al- ready referred to, all the more that the preservation of this memorial is due to David Paterson, the \"Peter Pattieson \" of Sir Walter Scott's \"Old Mortality.\" Sir Walter happened to be visiting in the house of the parish minister, and, going into the churchyard, he found this simple man anxiously clearing away the moss from the stone; the incident impressed the great novelist very deeply, and it vvas upon this foun- dation that he built up afterwards his remarkable tale of \" Old Mortality.\" Mr. Jervise also mentions, by the way, that during this same visit to Dunnottar, Scott met with Kate Moncur, a Caterline"], [451, "\"THE BULLERS OF BUCHAN.\" 431 The Pullers of Buchan.\" O not be ashamed suggestions of Nature's grandeur.

These rocks have been exposed to the constant beating and breaking of the wild waves upon them, and if you want to get an illus tration ofthe Scriptural figure about the water \"wearing the stones,\" you should go and see them. By this continual friction the great cliffs have gradually been worn through, and chasms and caverns have been formed, which are quite fearful to behold. The most tre mendous of these is called the \"Buller\" or Boiler of Buchan, and is a great wide cavern, in which the waters, having once entered, have made their home; and your only means of entering it is by boat, through an opening arched with rock. \"Within,\" says one writer fitly, \" a wild amphitheatre of rock is seen, as sublime as it is terrific.\" In the roof is an aperture which has been compared to the shaft of a vvell, and which mea sures fifty feet in diameter, and one hundred and fifty feet in height ; and the tourist who does not care for \u2014 or dare to take\u2014 any nearer view, is fain to get a glimpse of the awfulness of the place by looking down through this opening upon the seething waters below. It is a place tor no solt thoughts, but is full of A hundred years ago this lonely and awful place was visited by the renowned Dr. Johnson and his constant companion, and it may not be uninteresting to give here the account of their visit as re corded in the chatty pages of Boswell. They went to it, we may explain, from Slains Castle, of which more anon, and proceeded by way of Dunbui. \"We got immediately into the coach,\" says Boswell, \" and drove to Dunbui, a rock near the shore, quite covered with sea fowls ; then to a circular basin of large extent, surrounded with tremendous rocks. On the quarter next the sea there is a high arch in the rock, which the force of the tempest has driven out. This place is called Buchan's Buller, or the Buller of Buchan, and the country people call it the Pot. Mr. Boyd said it was called so from the French bouloir. It may be more simply traced from 'boiler' in our own language. We walked round this monstrous cauldron. In some places the rock is very narrow, and on each side there is a sea deep enough for a man-of-war to ride in, so that it is somewhat horrid to move along."], [452, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 432 However, there is earth and grass upon the rock, and a kind of road marked out by the print of feet, so that one makes it out pretty safely ; yet it alarmed me to see Dr. Johnson striding irregularly along. He insisted on taking a boat, and sailing into the Pot. We did so. He was stout, and wonderfully alert. The Buchan men all showing their teeth, and speaking with that sharp accent which distinguishes them, vvas to me a matter of curiosity. He vvas not sensi ble of the difference of pronunciation in the South and North of Scotland, which I wondered at. on this side of the grave. It is only when we look beyond into that other life which faith only can see, that the life of such great and greatly devout souls as that of Dr. Johnson towers in grandeur even above these forces before which we, awe-struck, are so ready at times to say, \"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man, that Thou visitest him f \" Leaving the Bullers, we may take a glance at Slains Castle, of which we have just spoken. It belongs to the Erroll family, and is a square building standing up on the top of a cliff which overhangs the sea. From the windows one looks out thus on the wild ocean, and, as Boswell put it, \"The King of Den mark is Lord Erroll's nearest neighbour on the north-east.\" It vvas just about a mile from this spot that a great battle was fought between the Danes and the Scots early in the eleventh century. The Danes were driven back, and Canute, here beaten, turned his attention southwards, and fared better in his attacks upon the southern portion of the island. The Scotch reverently buried the slain of their fallen foe, and built a chapel upon the spot, which they dedicated to Olaus, Denmark's patron saint. The little village of Cruden, which is supposed to be a corruption of words signifying \" kill the Dane,\" rose afterwards at this same place, and now gives its name to the parish in which Slains Castle is situated. As the entry into the Buller is so nar row that oars cannot be used as you go in, the method taken is to row very hard when you come near it, and give the boat such a rapidity of motion that it glides in. Dr. Johnson observed what an effect this scene would have had were we entering into an unknown place. There are caves of considerable depth, I think, on each side. The boatman had never entered either of them far enough to know the size. Mr. Boyd told us that it is customary for the company at Peterhead Well to make parties and come and dine in one of the caves here.\" Such are the Bullers of Buchan, hold ing their station still much as in the days when Johnson and Boswell saw them ; testifying once more to the enduring power of Nature's forces when com pared with the brief span of human life"], [453, "TO TIIE GARIOCH AND THE \" SAIR FIELD OF HARLAW.\" 433 To the Garioch and the \" Sair Pield of \"Harlaw taE are not yet Inverurie, a little town of considerable attractiveness on the river Urie. Near to it is a curious mound called the \" Bass,\" which is of conical shape, and altogether different from any other tumulus in Scot land. Antiquarians have taxed their brains in vain in trying to find out what it was used for, and how it originated. A favourite theory has been that it vvas a seat of judgment; while popular tra dition regarded it as the burial-mound of the time of the plague. This latter idea led to the probable enough supposition that it had been an ordi nary burial-place, and the conjec ture has been hazarded that it is the grave of a Pictish king ; but the scientists set all such theories aside, and say that it is simply a result of drift. Sir James Balfour, Lyon King-at-Arms in 1660, gives another popular saying regarding this curious place. He says : \u2014 \"Ye in habitants here have this foulish aid ryme always in their mouthe \u2014 finally done with this part of Scot- land, and we con- fess to having had some difficulty in quite settling which way to take the reader. It is evident that we must leave out some district; yet we can leave out none with out missing something in teresting. But really we have had to miss so much that was in teresting all through, that we have got to be somewhat hardened by this time; and we are prepared to face the good folk of the various towns which we pass in silence \u2014 should we ever see any of them. We think, then, upon the whole, that we cannot do better than make our way by Kintore, and through the land of \" the Garioch.\" Upon the earlier part of this journey there is not very much to attract atten tion. At a distance of about thirteen miles from Aberdeen we pass Kintore, which is said to have been a royal burgh from the ninth century, although it is more probable that the date at which it received this honour was some three centuries later. Near to it is an old ruin called Hallforest Castle, which is said to have been the hunting-lodge of the Mar family in very ancient times; and it gives the ground for the Kintore title to its present possessors. A little way beyond Kintore is Keith Hall or Caskie ben, the seat of the Earl of Kintore, but more notable as the place where the once famous poet, Arthur Johnstone, vvas born in 15S7. ' When Dee and Don runs both in one, And Tweed shall run in Tay, The little river of Inverury, Shall bear ye Basse away.' \" We now go across the \"bonnie watei of Urie,\" and in a little while we are in the country of \"the Garioch,\" known as the \"girnel\" (meal-press) of Aberdeenshire. To us, one ofthe chief points of interest in this part of the country is the spot called Harlaw, at which an important battle vvas fought in the year 141 1, between the Earl of Mar and Donald of the Isles, the issue being the decision of the long-vexed question ofthe supremacy of Highlander or Lowlander in Scotland. Tytler gives the following description ofthe battle: \u2014 About three miles beyond Kintore is"], [454, "PIC TURE SQ UE SCO TLA ND. 434 \" Mar immediately advanced from Aberdeen, and, marching by Inverury, came in sight of the Highlanders at the village of Harlaw, on the water of Ury, not far from its junction with the Don. He found that his little army vvas immensely outnumbered \u2014 it is said, by nearly ten to one; but it consisted of the bravest barons in these parts, and his experience had taught him to con sider a single knight in steel a fair match against a whole troop of kethe rans. Without delay, therefore, he in trusted the leading of the advance to the Constable of Dundee and Ogilvy, the Sheriff of Angus, who had with them a small but compact battalion of men-at arms; whilst he himself followed with the rearward, composed of the main strength of his army, including the Irvings, the Maules, the Morays, the Straitons, the Lesleys, the Stirlings, the Lovels, headed by their chiefs, and with their banners and penoncelles waving amid their grove of spears. Ofthe Islesmen and Highlanders, their principal leaders were the Lord of the Isles himself, with Macintosh and Maclean, the heads of their respective septs, and innumerable other chiefs and chieftains, animated by the old and deep-rooted hostility between the Celtic and Saxon race. with his main army into the very heart of the enemy, found himself in the same difficulties, becoming every moment more tired with slaughter, more encum bered with the numbers ofthe slain, and less able to resist the increasing and reckless ferocity of the masses that still yelled and fought around him. It was impossible that this should continue much longer without making a fatal im pression on the Scots ; and the effects of fatigue were soon seen. The Con stable of Dundee was slain; and the Highlanders, encouraged by his fall, wielded their broadswords and Lochaber axes with murderous effect, seizing and stabbing the horses, and pulling down their riders, whom they despatched with their short daggers. In this way were slain some of the best soldiers of these northern districts. Sir Robert Davidson, with the greater part of the burgesses who fought around him, were amongst the number; and many of the families lost not only their chief, but every male in the house. Lesley of Balquhain, a baron of ancient lineage, is said to have fallen with six of his sons slain beside him. The Sheriff of Angus with his eldest son, George Ogilvy, Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum, Sir Robert Maule, Sir Thomas Moray, William Abernethy, Alexander Straiton of Lauriston, James Lovel, Alexander Stirling, and above five hundred men-at-arms, including the principal gentry of Buchan, shared their fate, whilst Mar himself, and a small number of the survivors, still continued the battle till nightfall. The slaughter then ceased; and it was found in the morning that the island lord had retreated to Inverury and the hill of Benochie, checked and broken certainly by the desperate contest, but neither con quered nor very effectually repulsed. Mar, on the contrary, although he passed the night on the field, did so, not in the triumphant assertion of victory, but from the effects of wounds and exhaustion ; the best and bravest of his friends were The shock between two such armies may be easily imagined to have been dreadful ; the Highlanders, who were ten thousand strong, rushing on with the fierce shouts and yells which it vvas their custom to raise in coming into battle, and the knights meeting them with levelled spears, and ponderous maces and battle-axes. In his first onset, Scrymgeour, and the men-at-arms who fought under him, with little difficulty drove back the mass of Islesmen, and cutting his way through their thick columns, made a cruel slaughter. But though hundreds fell around him, thou sands poured in to supply their place, more fierce and fresh than their prede cessors ; whilst Mar, who had penetrated"], [455, "TO THE GARIOCH AND THE \" SAIR FIELD OF HARLA W.\" 435 stretched around him ; and he found him self totally unable to pursue the retreat of the Islesmen. Among those of the Highlanders who fell, were the chiefs of Maclean and Macintosh, with upwards of nine hundred men ; a small loss com pared with that sustained by the Low landers. The battle was fought on St. James's Eve, the 24th of July, and from the ferocity with which it was contested, and the dismal spectacle of civil war and bloodshed exhibited to the country, it appears to have made a deep impres sion on the national mind.\" \" O cam ye frae the Highlands, man ? O cam ye a' the way ? Saw ye MacDonnell and his men, As they cam frae the Skye ? \" \" Yes, we cam frae the Highlands, man.

Come, tell to me, John Hielandman, What might their numbers be?\" \" Yes, we was near, and near eneugh, And w*e their numbers saw ; Such is the comparatively one-sided account of Tytler ; but the battle of Har law seems to have been regarded and felt throughout the Lowlands a much greater moral victory than the historian appears to think. It rolled back the tide of Celtic influence once for all ; it was one of those cases in which defeat would have been final, while success, however slender and unsatisfactory, was a pledge of permanent deliverance. And it seems fit that, in a book like this, in which, as we wander through the coun try in the spirit of the time, treating Highland and Lowland as practically one, we should step aside a little to tell this story of fierce contest at Harlaw, as showing through what feelings of aliena tion, what testings of national strength, what Celtic and anti-Celtic outbursts of passion, Scotland has come to be the peaceful home alike of Saxon and of Gael.

The edifice vvas founded about the year 1224 by Bishop Andreas de Moravia, otherwise Andrew Murray, and stands at the north-east end of the town ; but its first lease of life was comparatively short. The no torious Wolf of Badenoch, being enraged at a sentence of excommunication which had been passed against him for one of his many offences, with childish revenge burnt down the Cathedral and great part of the town in 1390. It was rebuilt in the form of a Jerusalem cross, with five towers, two at either end, and one in the centre.

It cannot be said that, so far as its own situation is con cerned, it possesses any special claims to be called beautiful; but in its immediate neighbourhood there are very fine land scapes, and the country around, alike for its rich productiveness and its beauty, hasbeen called the \" Garden of Scotland.\" The temperature is high, and the air is balmy and genial \u2014 a town, therefore, the more welcome to those of us who feel the cold winds of the North in some parts a little too strong for us.

From that time the humiliation of this ancient house of worship proceeded, and, as has too often happened elsewhere in Scot land, the people were allowed to come and carry off stones from it wherewith to build their houses. To-day we live in times more reverent, in some respects at least; and though we adhere loyally to the great Reformation, we are more careful of structures such as these, which are not only reminders of a past worship, but monuments of our fathers also. In 1S20 the Commissioners of Woods and Forests took possession of it for the crown, and it is now kept from further ruin. which \"sends forth, tree-like, as it ap proaches the roof, its branches to the different angles, each with its peculiar incrustation of rich decorations, and its grotesque corbel.\" This pillar has a tradition associated with it which is in the main identical with that related con cerning the \"'Prentice Pillar\" at Roslin. Here \u2014 upon this same pillar\u2014 is the stone reading-desk to which the Bible used to be chained. This portion con tains some old monuments which are well worthy of being noted ; one has for its design a grotesque representation of a witch riding upon a broomstick. Fergusson, one of our greatest authorities upon architecture, says of this building : \u2014 \" Perhaps the most beau tiful building in Scotland is, or vvas, the Cathedral of Elgin. ... As compared with English cathedrals, that at Elgin must be considered a small church. . . . It is very beautifully arranged, and on the whole is perhaps more elegant in plan than any of the Southern examples.\" The choir he speaks of as \"virtually a great east window, but with piers be tween the compartments instead of mul lions,\" and he characterises it as ex quisite in its details, and, as to its whole design, \" very rich and beautiful.\" Near to Elgin is a place vvell known to all ecclesiologists\u2014 the religious house of Pluscarden, concerning which a luxurious and beautiful book has been written by the Rev. S. R. Macphail, of Liverpool. To this we must refer the reader who desires to know the details of its history. The ruins lie in a fair valley, encircled by thickly-wooded hills; and in the old ruin, with its ivy-mantled towers, set there in its shady valley with its woods of varied hue around, the painter may find a welcome study for a picture, the poet a fine theme for a song. The priory dates from the year 1230, and was dedicated to the patron saint of Scotland. The whole length of the building has been variously estimated at 264 and 2S9 feet in length, while the nave and side aisles were 87 feet broad, and the choir and cloisters 79 feet. The chief en trance \u2014 from the west side \u2014 stretches between the great western towers, which, rising to the height of S4 feet, are to be seen from a long distance. The arched portion of the great en trance is notable for the singular de licacy of its ornamentation, which points back to a very remote age. The portion of the building which is in the best state of preservation is theChapter-house tothe north-east, which is called the \" 'Prentice Aisle,\" from having in the centre \"a beautiful flowered and clustered pillar,\" Thus in and about Elgin there is not a little to see, especially for those of"], [458, "438 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. artistic and antiquarian likings.

All the world has read his story in Dr. Smiles's interesting volume \u2014 the most interesting volume in the Self-Hclp series. In truth, we were getting rather tired of that penny-wise philosophy which ithas been Dr. Smiles's chosen and congenial mission in life to preach. This age has already heard enough of the gospel of getting on with its smug selfishness and veiled assertion of the beneficence of \" Nature's poor law \" of"], [461, "THE WORTHIES OF BANFF. 441 \u2022destruction to the weak. It is something better that Dr. Smiles has here given us \u2014 a life of \"one of those men who lived for science, not by science \" \u2014 one who, in his own words, had been a fool to Nature all his life. life. But there would be no science at all if it were not for such men as Thomas Edward. It would be an interesting task to con trast the life of Edward with the life ofa man like Sir David Brewster, and to point out the points of difference and resem blance. Brewster was born in comfort able circumstances, and his whole life vvas one long series of successes and honours. His life shows us that he too vvas obliged to work hard, though under very much more agreeable conditions. Perhaps the difference in their lots in life has not been so great as we might imagine, looking merely at externals. They were both devoted to science, and in their scientific researches they at once found their life-work and their life-works' reward. A case like Brewster's seems to have occurred to Edward, as we find an expression chronicled to the effect that with help he might have made his way in the world; we have no doubt that he would, and then the world would have lost a most attractive picture and example \u2014 the picture and example of one who, whilst remaining a humble workman, became at the same time an eminent man of science. Dr. Smiles has also acted very judici ously in giving us a great deal of Ed ward's own words in the book, for those are always graphic and pointed. The well-earned reward of a small pension from the Crown, brought to him by the widespread interest which Dr. Smiles's book caused, was something that he neither could nor did expect. All that he did vvas from pure unselfish love of science, and on this account, whilst obliged to work for his daily bread, he spent whole nights out in the fields and woods, and gained a more intimate ac quaintance with the birds and beasts of those northern coasts than perhaps any other man had ever done before him. \" A prophet is not without honour save in his own country and among his own people,\" and naturally the narrow shrewdness of Banff considered him mad for neglecting the tangible results of the cash-box for a thing so unsubstantial as an acquaintance with the ways of wild HOUSE IN WHICH SIR DAVID BREWSTER LIVED."], [462, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 442 Glasgow : Scotland's Commercial Capital. .0 MPARI SONS of Cromwell's soldiers in 1650, a testi mony which must be very welcome to all Glaswegians: \u2014 \"The town of Glasgow, though not so big and rich, yet to all seems a much sweeter and more delight ful place than Edinburgh.\" In 1658 the \"Perfect Politician\" wrote of it as \"a city of a pleasant site, upon a river navi gable for small boats, which usually bring up provisions from Patrick' s-town, ten miles thence, where ships of good burthen may ride.

Edinburgh is possessed of greater natural advantages than almost any capital in the world; Glasgow7 is in this respect below the average of cities. We never heard any one deny that Edinburgh was pic turesque ; we never heard any one assert that Glasgow- was so. And yet the latter lies on the banks of a noble river, which, in some parts of its course above and below the city, would challenge comparison with the Rhine itself. Not only so, but the Highland hills come within a few miles of the town ; whilst it has an intimate association with one of the most beautiful of Highland Lochs, for does it not draw its water supply from Loch Katrine? Much of of its poverty in this regard is due, no doubt, to its heavy and moist atmos phere, which seems to keep the smoke lingering about it, and gives it a dulness which it would not otherwise have. With increase of commerce this dulness has also increased; and we dream sometimes that if the veil were lifted from the city, our adverse criti cisms of it would be silent. Pennant, in his famous \"Tour of Scotland,\" speaks of the view of it from the Cross in his day, when mills were fewer, and the smoke was neither so abundant nor so dirty, as having \"an air of vast magni ficence.\" A still older testimony is that McUre, who wrote about tw7o centuries ago thus dwells upon its grandeur : \u2014 Glasgow, to thee thy neighbouring towns give place, 'Bove them thou lifts thine head with comely grace.

Glasgow is a little over forty seven miles from Edinburgh, from which it is readied in about an hour by dwellers in the Alpine districts of Italy were with ancient Rome. Here are some lines of his story : \u2014 Her nainsel into Glasgow went An erran there to see 't ; And she ne'er pe saw a ponier town, Was stan'ing on her feet. For a' the houses that be there Te theikit [thatched] wi' plue stanes, And a stane ladder to gang up, express. The town, as it now is, is comparatively modern, but the germinal place from which it has been developed is of very ancient date. As to the name, great difference of opinion has been expressed, some thinking that it is derived from words signifying \"grey smith,\" while others think that it means literally \u2022 'dark glen,\" the reference being to the deep valley to the east of the cathedral. But there is a general consent of opinion that the name is of Celtic origin. When you wish to get at the founding of a city, you are generally expected to go back to the time of the Romans at least; and there is a tradition that the Romans, during their occupancy of Britain, had a station here about the spot where the cathedral is now. It may have been so, but there is- little historical foundation forthe idea ; and the earliest date at which we reach anything like firm historical ground is the year 560, when St. Kentigern, or St. Mungo, is believed to have founded the See of Glasgow. Kentigern is said to have been grandson to King Loth, one of the Pictish sovereigns, and to have been born about the year 5 16. No fa' to prack her banes.

But we must turn aside from these quaint delights of other days, and set ourselves to tell the reader something- more substantial concerning this great industrial city of the West, which presents no mean claim to be regarded as the \"second city in the kingdom.\" He was trained under Servanus, bishop of Orkney, who used to ad dress him familiarly as \"Mongah\" (in Norse, \"dear friend\"), and hence, says ancient story, his name Mungo. The story of Kentigern's coming to Glasgow is thus related by Mr. Mac- George in his recently published rind beautiful book on \"Old Glas gow\": \u2014 \"After leaving Servanus, Kenti gern went to lodge in the house of a A word as to its geography.

Imme diately after Kentigern entered his house he expired, and Kentigern, having placed the body on a car to w7hich were yoked two wild bulls, he commanded them to carry it to the place ordained of the Lord. This they meekly did, and, followed by the saint and a great multi tude, carried the body to Glasgow, then by a white alb, he wore over his neck a long stole. Pie had a pastoral staff, not rounded, or gilt, or gemmed, as is now seen with those in high places, but of plain wood, yet curved back, tamen rejlcxuin.

Here the remains of the good Fergus were committed to the earth, and over what vvas supposed, no doubt, to be the very spot of his interment, the south transept of the cathedral was founded, and the lower aisle or crypt dedicated to Fergus.\" A monastic settlement vvas founded here by this saint, which Mr. MacGeorge believes to have been nothing more than a \"rude village of huts, constructed probably of wood and wattles ;\" and in this little hamlet we may be said to find the nucleus of the city of Glasgow. After this, history leaves a long gap \u2014 extending to about four centuries at least; the next thing recorded regarding Glasgow, indeed, being the appointment of three successive bishops, an entry regarding which is made in the annals of York Minster, in the year io-jo, and even of this entry the authenticity is doubted. In 1120, King David, then Prince of Cumberland, re-established the see, and had his chaplain, John Achaius, a very erudite man, inducted as bishop in the year 1 129. Soon after Kentigern's settlement here, the King of the Strathclyde Britons so persecuted him that he had to flee into Wales, where he founded the church of Llanelwy, which vvas afterwards dedica ted to St. Asaph. Marken,however, having been overthrown in battle, in 573, Rhyd derch, his conqueror, who vvas a Chris tian, invited Kentigern to return to Glasgow, which he did. It would seem that on his way home he tarried at several places in the south of Scotland, and hence the dedication of churches to him at Annandale, at Peebles and Peni cuick, and other places. Pie is said to have died in Glasgow in the year 601, and to have been buried in the cathedral. So much for the history, as legend tells it, of the founder of Glasgow Cathedral and city. Perhaps our readers would be interested in the sketch of his dress which is given by Jocelin, Monk of Fur ness Abbey, and is a study indeed in the ecclesiastical antique:\u2014 \"He wore a shirt of roughest haircloth next his skin, and over it a garment made of the skins of goats, and a close hood like that of a fisherman.

It is noteworthy that all through those early times the history of Glasgow was practi cally the history of its bishops; it vvas, in fact as truly as in name, a bishop's burgh; and it seems to have prospered very much according to the gifts and o-races of its spiritual father.

In 1560, or, generally speaking, about the time of the Reformation, the population is supposed to have been 4,500; in i6ioit vvas 7,644; in 1660 it was 14,67s; in 1688 it was found to have gone down again to 11,94s. In 170S it was 12,766; in 1712 it vvas 13,832; in 1740 it had risen to over 17,000, and in 1755 to 23,546; while in 1763 it vvas 28,300. From this time it rose steadily until, in 1S01, it possessed a population of over 77,000, and, in 1 83 1, of 202,426. During the fifty odd years that have elapsed from that time to this, Glasgow has continued to grow and increase marvellously, and is now, in point of population, the second city in the United Kingdom. ron, one of the family of Lochiel \u2014 in the 15th century \u2014 it rose to still greater prominence. \"The see, during his in cumbency,\" says one writer, \" vvas in the zenith of its splendour, and his character has become the subject of unbounded praise and unlimited censure, as different parties have become his historians.\" It does not appear that in those early times Glasgow vvas much involved in the successive conflicts which agitated Scot land. Mention is made, however, of a conflict which took place on the street of the town between the soldiers of Edward I. and a band of Scotsmen, headed by William Wallace. It occurred in the night, and ended in the complete victory of Wallace and his men. He himself slew Earl Percy, and took possession of the Bishop's Castle. There is mention of a parliament being held in Glasgow in the year 134S; and perhaps the next notable event is one which recalls its ecclesiastical, rather than political, im portance in those days \u2014 namely, its erection into an archbishopric about a century and a-half after the last-men tioned date. We return, however, to our historical sketch. With the Reformation, Glas gow seems to have become more mixed up with affairs than it had previously been. Comparatively quiet and peace ful under Episcopal rule, indeed, there were not a few who dreaded the Refor mation lest it should work a change in this regard; and there can be little doubt that the external effect of the change was at the time not pleasant to tranquil, laissezjaire sort of people. The last Roman Catholic archbishop vvas James Beaton, a nephew of the notorious Cardinal of that name, and he came to his see in times which were too hard for him. Fearing lest there should be some trouble, the \"canny\" prelate made his way into France in 1560, carefully tak ing with him all the valuables of the cathedral, with its deeds and other docu ments. Twenty-eight years afterwards, he vvas reappointed to his see, but he thought evidently that he was on the safer side of the water, and \u2014 remained there. He died in 1603, leaving all the precious things of the Cathedral to the Scotch College in Paris, and to the Carthusian monastery, to be restored to Glasgow when Glasgow should be re stored to their Church. In this case Let it be understood that all through this time Glasgow was only a very small place. Its population up to the end of the fifteenth century appears to have been not more than fifteen hundred souls ; and its increase seems to have dated from about the time when the university vvas founded (1452-3). \"The population,\" we are told, ' began to creep slowly down the hill upon which the cathedral stands; andhaving reached the position of the present cross, it branched slightly east and west, forming portions of the streets now called Gal lowgate and Trongate, and as the craft of fishermen had sprung up among the people, Saltmarket-street was laid out lor the means of easy access to the river.\" It is only in comparatively recent times that Glasgow has become populous; and a few statistics of its growth in this respect may perhaps"], [467, ""], [468, "NEW BARONY CHURCH, GLASGOW."], [469, ""], [470, ""], [471, "GLASGO W. 447 they are pretty certain to remain for some lime yet. The loss of the valuables was, let us say, much more serious than that of the Archbishop. the fact that, at Darnley's request, she sent her own physician to wait upon him \u2014 a physician who had seen herself brought through an attack of the same malady, and who had her entire con fidence. But there were other respects in which Glasgow vvas a sufferer in outward things at this time. The crown and nobles marred the glory of the Refor mation here as everywhere by seizing Church lands, and, in the case of Glasgow7, this meant seizure of property which practically belonged to the people; and the spoliation was carried out in circum stances of peculiar hardship. Moreover, the removal of a great religious body with much wealth meant also a great decrease in \" custom,\" and in this way- Glasgow also suffered. But it is to its credit to be said that, while some flinched and winced under a change which, they fancied, boded chiefly ill, the people of Glasgow accepted nobly the faith of the Reformation, and, calmly at the same time going on their way and attending to their business, they achieved material prosperity \u2014 in what great measure we know. In 163S an interesting event took place in Glasgow, viz., the meeting of that General Assembly whose decisions were fraught with such important issues both for Church and State in Scotland. At this gathering a decided stand was made. Scotland practically said to Episcopacy that it would have none of it; the Laudian Liturgy was set aside, and the long conflict between Prelatist and Presbyterian vvas fairly begun. The month of January, 1652, is memorable as the month of a fearful and calamitous fire. It broke out on the east side of High-street, and in a little while six \"alleys\" of houses had been destroyed. \"While the inhabitants of the neighbourhood were assembled,\" says one, \" for the removal of the goods, and hindering as much as possible the spreading of the flame, the wind blowing from the north-east carried such sparks of the fire in the opposite direction as kindled some houses on the west side of the Salt market, insomuch that both sides of the street were totally consumed, and in it the most extensive edifices of the town. It is estimated that about a third of the town vvas destroyed ; and the people had to find shelter for awhile in huts in the fields, a thousand families having been made for the time homeless. A hundred thousand pounds was estimated as the extent of the loss. The fire, however, was not without a compensation in one respect. Formerly a great part of the town had been built of wood, and the speed w7ith which it perished in the flames led the people to build anew in stone, much to its improvement in ap pearance and security.\" It is interesting to know that for a time, in the midst of its troubles, Glas gow vvas a royal residence, a circum stance which happened in this way. Lord Darnley, the ill-starred husband of Queen Mary, vvas seized with small-pox in January, 1567, at Stirling Castle, and quietness being necessary to him, he was taken to Glasgow \u2014 a change which would scarcely be thought of as one from bustle to quiet in our day.\u00b0 Queen Mary followed him thither. Of course people rushed to the conclusion that it vvas no epidemic, but poison, from which he was suffering. It is painful to think that George Buchanan, who had some sense of truth and honour, should have allowed himself to become the mouthpiece of the libel that Mary had administered poison to him herself at Stirling.

But it was else where that the great events of the Covenanting struggle took place, and it seems to have been more by accident than otherwise that Glasgow had any great share in the national events of the time. For Glasgow, let us repeat, has no claim to great historical importance; its two-fold claim upon our notice is in its early prominence as the seat of an ecclesiastical see, and its modern pro minence as a centre of world-wide com merce. thus comparatively small, but \u2014 in the words of the writer already quoted \u2014 \"its situation is so good, and its design and proportions so satisfactory throug-fi out, that it is more imposing than many others of twice its dimensions.\" The spire is 219 feet high, and gives a noble completeness to the whole structure. We cannot resist the temptation to set side by side with this matter-of-fact sketch another from a master-hand \u2014 the description which occurs in Rob Roy : \u2014 \" The pile is of a gloomy and massive, rather than of an elegant style of Gothic architecture; but its peculiar character is so strongly preserved, and so well suited with the accompaniments that surround it, that the impression of the first view was awful and solemn in the extreme. . . . Situated in a populous and considerable town, this ancient and massive pile had the appearance of the most sequestered solitude. High walls divide it from the buildings of the city on one side; on the other, it is bounded by a ravine, at the bottom of which, and invisible to the eye, murmurs a wander ing rivulet, adding, by its gentle noise, to the imposing solemnity of the scene. On the opposite side of the ravine rises a steep bank, covered with fir-trees closely planted, whose dusky shade ex tends itself over the cemetery with an appropriate and gloomy effect. The churchyard itself had a peculiar cha racter; for though in reality extensive, it is small in proportion to the number of respectable inhabitants that are interred within it, and whose graves are almost all covered with tombstones. There is therefore no room for the long rank grass, which in most cases partially clothes the surface of those retreats, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest Keeping these facts before us, it is time to give some little account of its Cathedral, which may be said to be the embodiment of its earlier history. Fer gusson characterises it as one of \" the most satisfactory and characteristic buildings to be found in the country,\" and he gives the following brief and succinct description of it: \u2014 \" The bishopric was founded by David I., but it was not till after several de structions by fire that the present build ing vvas commenced, probably about the year 1240. The crypt and the whole of the choir belong to the latter part of the thirteenth century, the nave to the fourteenth, and the tow7er and spire to the fifteenth. The central aisle never having been intended to be vaulted, the architect has been enabled to dispense with all pinnacles, flying buttresses, and such expedients, and thus to give the whole outline a degree of solidity and repose which is extremely beautiful, and accords perfectly with the simple lancet openings which prevail throughout.\" The whole length of the edifice, mea sured outside, and exclusive of the western tower, is 300 feet ; the breadth is 73 ; the area about 26,400 feet. It is \" The Cathedral itself corresponds in impressive majesty with these accom paniments.

Readers of Rob Roy will remember Andrew Fairservice's account of the plan which was formed against it by \"the commons o' Renfrew, and o' the Barony, and the Gorbals, and a' about,\" and how they were met in battle by the townsmen who \" feared their auld edifice might slip the girths in gaun through siccan rough physic.\" But much fine work in altar and orr-ament, in sculpture and painted glass, vvas made away with about that time; and at a much later date \u2014 in the year 1820 \u2014 an official vandalism which had no manner of excuse, cleared away one of the western towers and the consis tory-house in order to prepare for im proving- the Cathedral ! But still it stands there, in the heart of Glasgow, yet locally, as well as otherwise, above it, a sanctuary whose beauty makes us feel how poor is our language to ex press our admiration. It speaks to bustling, hurrying Glasgow of to-day of the old, devout saint who laid its foundations, and commends the quieter graces which in him appear, rising above the corruptions of the time; and high on its hill there it calls the men of the city to loftier aims and holier en deavours. The grandest part of the Cathedral is on all hands allowed to be the Crypt, which our great architectural authority pronounces \" unrivalled in Britain, and, indeed, perhaps in Europe.\" It belongs to the thirteenth century, and forms a base to the whole choir, under and be yond which it extends. \"There is,\" says Fergusson, \" a solidity in its archi tecture, a richness in its vaulting, and a variety of perspective in the spacing of its pillars, which make it one ofthe most perfect pieces of architecture in these islands.\" The centre of the Crypt con tains the shrine of St. Mungo, in which is the \"headless and handless\" repre sentation of the old patron saint. And probably of more interest to not a few of us is the fact that Edward Irving, once the \" cynosure of all eyes \" in London, a strange, comet-like figure, yet now a dear and holy memory, vvas buried. Nothing could be more fitly suggestive than the fact that in the window above it is the figure of John the Baptist, the stern preacher of righteousness.

A turn to the left brings the visitor to a fourth, entirely appropriated to the re sidence of the professors.

We doubt if it had upon a large number of them ; we have never found an old fashioned seclusion beside a crowded street so quick as the reader fancies in casting off \"the coil of the world and its contemptible realities.\" But we know that many a true and lofty spirit learned to train its wings for flight in that old College of Glasgow. Many memorable names are as- sociated with the College of Glasgow, and many a pleasant page might be written concerning its famous teachers and students. Here, in the middle of the seventeenth century, David Dickson, an eminent ecclesiastic and theologian of his day, who is known by name at least to all who know anything of Scottish history, acted as Professor of Divinity, expounding the Scriptures, training his students in preaching, and, as vvas the manner of his time, lecturing upon casuistical divinity. Few men of his time so widely influenced the next gene- ration as did David Dickson. Robert Baillie, whose quaint and clever \"Letters and Journals \" tell us the most that we know of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, and form altogether a striking memorial of his time, vvas many years one of the professors of divinity, and finally became Principal in 1661. And here, in later times, Thomas Campbell the poet, author of the \" Pleasures of Hope,\" received his early training, re- turning hither in the proud position of Lord Rector to serve his Alma Mater for a short while in the heyday of his fame. When attending College, Campbell seems to have been \u2014 as he could scarce fail to be \u2014 a marked man. Gifted with ge- nius, and full of wit, old students tell how truly he vvas a centre of attraction to his fellow-students. Gathering around the stove in the Logic class-room, and glad to feel both warmth and joyousness ere they encountered the biting frost of a lecture, perhaps upon the Syllogism, the inquiry would go round, \" What has Tom Campbell been saying?\" Then some odd inscription \u2014 in verse probably \u2014 would be found by some one on the wall \u2014 \"Tom's\" work, no doubt \u2014 and many a merry laugh would be heard as the lines were read out. Campbell used to say Originally the College vvas not here; its germ \u2014 the \"Schools\" \u2014 vvas a house which had been owned by the minister of Luss, and which went by the name of \" the auld Pedagogy.\" This stood in Rotten Row, and it included a residence for the students which was called \" Collegium.\" In 1459, however, a part ofthe land in High-street was obtained, by grant in favour of \" Master Duncan Bunch, principal regent of the faculty of arts in the Studium of Glasgow,\" a stipu lation being that twice a day regents and students should rise and pray for the soul of James, Lord Hamilton, the donor, and Euphemia his wife. The property vvas considerably augmented by Queen Mary in 1563. The old building, however, was not begun till 1632, and vvas not completed till about a quarter of a century later. It seems that in this (then) new college the students resided, having their apart- ments in the various courts, and dining at one table\u2014 at first paying nothing for their lodging, but, after 1712, being assessed at rates varying from four to ten shillings per session \u2014 not a very ruinous sum, certainly. A reminiscence of those old days is found in the pages of Dr. Alexander Carlyle's Autobiography, in which he says:\u2014 \"I had my lodging this session in a college room which I had furnished for the session at a moderate rent.

Campbell left college when about twenty years of age. In 1828 he had finished his \" Pleasures of Hope,\" which he sold for sixty pounds! It is not our business to follow this alumnus of Glasgow College through the story of his growing fame, but we may give one picture \u2014 drawn from the genial pages \"Vos, Hiberni, collocatis Summum Eonum in \u2014 potatoes 1 \" All owned the sally clever, and mean while Campbell had got within the"], [477, "\" GLASGO IV COLLEGE.\" 453 of George Gilfillan\u2014 of his election as Lord Rector, a picture of the College in that day as well as of the man. opposed to Campbell, seemed excited, in a measure, by the scene; and the students, especially those of us who had voted for him, were in a state of uncon trollable enthusiasm.

A very large and commodious reading room for the students is in close proximity to the library. The Common Hall \u2014 called the ' Bute Hall ' \u2014 has been erected by the Marquis of Bute, atan expense of about \u00a340,000 and a bequest of \u00a360,000 by Charles Randoph, an eminent marine engineer, is, among other purposes, to be devoted to finishing the great tower.\" Campbell set himself \u2014 to his honour be it spoken ! \u2014 to do something, during his Rectorship, for the improvement of his loved University, and thus marked his term of office as one of the most brilliant which that University \u2014 whose Rectors have always been \"picked\" men \u2014 has known. The University possesses a very fine library, one special feature in its wealth being the possession of the library ot the eminent philosopher ofa former day, Sir William Hamilton ; and the Hun terian Library has a fine collection of early printed books, and pictures. Of the old College, as a whole, it seems to us that a broad, wholesome, g-enial humanity vvas a chief character istic. Aberdeen was more scholarly, but more stolid; Edinburgh more phi losophical, but more priggish; St. Andrew's more refined perhaps, but weaker. But Glasgow, so far as our superficial knowledge of it goes, went more to the making of big, broad human natures, strong, thoughtful, en thusiastic, lacking in the finer touches of culture more than in aught else. And thus of its alumni it has had much reason to be proud, less for their scholarly distinction than for their strong manhood. We mention two names as typical \u2014 names taken from the roll of lamous men of our own time, and familiar to us all \u2014 David Livingstone and Norman M'Leod. It only remains to be said that the University of Glasgow possesses amongst its present staff of professors not a few men of great eminence. The elo quent Dr. Caird is Principal, and his scarcely less eminent brother, Mr. Ed ward Caird, is Professor of Moral Philosophy ; Mr. Nichol, whose own contributions to our literature are of high order, is Professor of English Literature ; the occupant of the Chair of Logic is favourably known as the bio grapher of Sir William Hamilton; few men with any pretensions of a know ledge of contemporary literature or science can fail to know the names of Professor Jebb, of the Greek Chair; and Sir William Thomson, the Professor of Natural Pnilosophy."], [479, "THE CL YDE. 455 The Clyde.

A little further forward, on the same side, is Helensburgh, a gay little town much frequented in summer by the rich merchants of Glasgow, and situated pic turesquely just at the opening of the Gareloch, on whose shores lie the well known villages of Roseneath and Row. any critical eye un happily should scan it \u2014 will detect, amidst many de- fects, this, that too little by far has been said about the Clyde. We console ourselves by thinking that, perhaps, this is the less blameworthy, since of all the rivers of Scot- land, perhaps none is so well known ; but we still feel that we should make this portion of our book sadly defective did we not say something of it here. Perhaps we shall do the best we can do, now that space is very limited, by telling our readers something of its beauties by describing one of the finest excursions that can be made in or about Scotland \u2014 the trip to Ardrishaig. On the opposite side from Helens burgh, and forming the chief halting place of our steamer, is Greenock, \"populous with ships,\" and famous, not for its shipping only, but for its sugar refineries, ironworks, cotton and woollen manufactures, etc. Here James Watt, the engineer, was born ; but no trace remains of his home save in the \"Watt Tavern,\" which has been built upon its site. A better memorial of him is the Watt Monument, built by the younger Watt, to house a library which he had presented to the town. The tourist, upon pleasure bent, will probably resist the temptation \u2014 perhaps will not feel it \u2014 to halt at Greenock. Like most places of bustling trade, it gives but little quarter to the lounger or the traveller. Steaming away again, therefore, you soon forget the sugar-refining and the cotton spinning, and rejoice to find yourself fairly launched upon the broad estuary of the Clyde. Now you are amidst the glories of Scottish scenery, and realise to yourself the poet's description of it as We start in early morning from Glas gow, and make our way out of the smoky city by way of Partick, at which point the great river is joined by the Kelvin. Amongst the places of interest which we pass in the earlier part of our journey are Elderslie, the birthplace of William Wallace, and Blythswood, close by which the little stream, the Cart, to use Burns's phrase, \" rins rowing to tho sea.\" But it is when the river opens out about Dumbarton that it wears again the glory which it possessed in its upper reaches before it was con taminated by the trade of the great town.

But soon the boat turns to the left, and the glori ous open expanse of Loch Ridden spreads out before you. \"Here we have glen and mountain, loch and stream, with, if it be calm, the reflection of the hills in the bright green water, so that every turn we make discloses new and more exciting beauties.\" Just at the entrance to this loch is a small island called Eilan Greg, with one single tree upon it \u2014 a spot notable from the fact that here a fort was built by the Earl of Argyle in 1685, upon the occa sion of his unfortunate attempt. A more beautiful description of this scene could not be found ; and, we should add also, perhaps no more truthful account could be given ; only that to us uncommercial folk, envious perhaps; somewhat of the very-well-to-do, the \"consummate\" beauty of the \"flower\" is painfully mingled in thought with the \"consummate\" \u2014 vvell, lack of beauty, let us say, of the Glasgow tongue as spoken by one's side perchance by some portly Glasgow merchant, who has a country house down hereabout, and a good balance at his banker's. But we are forgetting to note the various places as we pass them. Here is Dunoon, now, along with Kirn, form ing nothing less than a little town ; and a few miles further on is Innellan, a sweet little village, its pretty row of villas stretching far along the shore, their windows seeming to smile a bright answer to the sun as you pass. Soon we are at Rothesay, the capital of the island of Bute, where we might vvell spend a whole holiday had we time. For Bute has been well described as \" fairest of all the islands of the Clyde.\" \" From its sheltered position,\" writes a somewhat extreme admirer, \"it has an atmosphere soft as that of Italy, and is one huge hospital now.

Many a \" tra velled\" man will confess that he has seen nothing grander, aye, even though he has sailed up the Rhine, and made himself acquainted with the Lurlei and the sweet town of Bingen. It is scenery which, given good weather \u2014 more scarce here thanin someothcrparts \u2014 neverpalls upon you, and those who are happy enough to live within easy reach of it will probably be the readiest to assert that, take this excursion every year, and several times a year, it always retains its charm, and its loveliness will never seem to wear out. There is something about it all, too, which is very exhila rating. Much of the country through which we have travelled in the course of our survey of Scotland, while grand, has been somewhat painfully impressive; wild Ben Nevis frowns upon you when you draw near to his feet; the \"melancholy main \" about Skye is too overwhelm ing for some of us; but the reach ofthe Clyde ever enriches the mind with fresh joys, and sills the soul with gladness. The broad expanse of blue waters, bright in the summer sunshine, and gay with many a thronged steamer and many a dainty yacht, speak shame to your dul ness ; the kindly western breeze wafts new health into heart and limb ; and, while yon remote mountains, even in their massive glory, speak peace to the people, the little hills rejoice on every side. verary, the capital of the Western High lands. Famed, far and near, for its herrings, which are supposed to be superior to all other herrings in the sea, it is none the less worthy to be reckoned famous for the grandeur of its scenery, which its more material renown has somewhat served to obscure, at least in the idea of those who have never seen it. In a little while you touch at Tarbert, a thriving little village, the emporium of the Loch Fyne herrings, and, moreover, beautifully situated on its own little loch. One is much tempted to break one's journey here, and some delightful days might be spent in exploring the scenery around. Tarbert, we may add, boasts its Castle, which was wont to be the great fortress of Cantyre, and formed the residence for a time in old days of the Bruce, and still later of James II. To the left of us, as we move onward, is the ridge called Sliabh Goil, the sup posed scene of the death of Diarmid, celebrated in the song of Ossian. And just while we are dreaming ourselves away into the strange, wild world which the name of Ossian calls up, we find ourselves at our journey's end, Loch Gilp, in the harbour of the fair little village of Ardrishaig, which to the tourist becomes again the starting-point for still grander excursions into the wild Highlands, where, having been already, alas, we cannot follow him.

In that little home of Blantyre, there were quiet influences at work which went to the making of this man what he was, and it is impossible to guess how much of the true greatness of his life had no crust to penetrate, but came beaming out freely like the light of the sun. Her son loved her, and in many ways followed her.

And when, in later years, he used to come down from Glasgow, he was the same David, nowise puffed up with what he had seen and experienced in the big \"toon,\" but full of talk about all that had been happening This was, indeed, enough \u2014 this home life of his in Blantyre \u2014 to make him love his own class as he did ; enough to make DAVID LIVINGSTONE. to him. Yet with this geniality there was no softness, and Dr. Blaikie relates an incident which shows his readiness to endure some hardship even in those early days. Neil Livingstone used to lock his door at the \"dark'nin',\" and every one him careless about the knighthoods so eagerly coveted, they say, by civic officials and the like. David was a favourite child in the home, happy and transparent in his cha racter\u2014a member of his household"], [486, "462 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. vvas expected by that time to be home. One evening David was late, and when he reached the house, the door vvas fast. He was equal to the situation ; he got a bit of bread, off which he made his sup per, and sat down quietly on the doorstep to pass the night; and when his mother, a little later, looked out to see if she could see any trace of him, there was the patient little lad resting quietly on the threshold of his home. It is out of such men that God often makes His heroes ; boys that make little noise, and do not show aught of the bully; apt and early scholars in the school of patient disci pline; and we think it is worth our going down to the unromantic little town of Blantyre just to get this fine hint ofa text in the old Book, \u2014 \" the meek shall inherit the earth.\" leave his first home without looking at his last alongside of it, and thinking the thoughts which come as we look no w on the \"house in which Livingstone vvas born,\" and now on the \" hut in which Living stone died.\" It is not, as so often, in the case of men who have become great; we do not mark the difference between the plainness of the birthplace and the grandeur of the last earthly dwel ling. Livingstone's last home was poorer far than his first \u2014 a shed \u2014 a hut ; and yet few grander lives than his have been lived during these years. Nay, might wenotsay that his life was all the grander for this ending in a tent of straw and not in a palace, for it tells of a life with no coarse ambitions, ambitions only to ful fil its purpose, ready to go anywhere save where its mission could not be accom plished. David Livingstone knew nothing of \"resting on his laurels,\" and the laurels were kept until they could be laid on his honoured grave in \" our holy and beautiful house\" at Westminster. When he was ten years old he went to work here in Blantyre as a \" piecer,\" and after a few years he became a \" spinner.\" The first half-crown he earned vvas laid in his mother's lap. By-and-by he vvas able to spend a little money upon his own purposes, and it is suggestive to find that one of his first luxuries was Ruddiman's \"Latin Rudi ments,\" over which he used to pore, night by night \u2014 aye, and on into the morning, if his mother did not come and take the book from his hands. . So his days and nights were spent, the one in toil, the other in study, until just when he was coming of age, the Inner Light began to lighten him, and, gentle and upright before, his life was touched with a new enthusiasm. He became a Christian in heart and soul. With this new develop ment came a desire for missionary labour, and at twenty-one he went to begin his studies in Glasgow. What a story lay between those two homes\u2014 the first and the last! With burning zeal for human souls, you see him pursuing those preparatory studies which we have just left, impressing his fellows, we may not doubt, with his holy ardour and enthusiasm. Anon we see him ordained and sent forth ; and yonder he is now among far-off heathen men, telling them that marvellous story which opened new and immortal springs in his being years ago. A kind and patient, as well as powerful, man is this mis sionary; and you cannot but feel that, even from the first, the men to whom he went must have felt \u2014 somewhat un consciously it may be\u2014 that no ordinary soul was among them. There is a curi ous and even playful suggestion about the story which they tell of some chief whom he met, and who wondered that he should so patiently and humbly try to per suade his listeners to accept Christianity. \" I would soon make them take my re ligion,\" said the chief; \"I would beat David Livingstone found his mission far away from his simple home at Blan tyre, and his lowly lodging in Glasgow, and made for himself a name which re flects glory, not only on the little cottage of Neil and Agnes Livingstone, but on Scotland and its people. We cannot"], [487, "IONA 463 them until they did.\" But Livingstone's manner of working had been learned in another school. All through he vvas the same patient boy whom we have seen waiting on the door-step at Blantyre. news came home again and again that he had reached further and further into the interior; how anxiously more intelli gence was waited for ; how he came home, and England scarce knew how to show her pride in him, who vvas not Scot land's only, but Britain's son; how in later days, when, as it seemed, nothing would tempt him away from his holy pilgrimage, he went so far \"ben\" that nothing vvas to be heard of him, and we grew afraid and sent explorers to discover him in vain ; how at last a dashing scion of our \" kinsfolk beyond the sea,\" H. M. Stanley, found him in the wilds, and brought us news of him; and then, all too soon after, as it seemed to us, how we heard of his last illness, and that mournful journey of our brave wan derer ; last of all, how we laid him to rest in the old Abbey : \u2014 all these things are matters of history. By-and-by Livingstone felt a new en thusiasm within him. His missionary zeal began to run in a new channel. He felt a desire to wander further into the interior of Africa than his ordinary work would allow him to penetrate, and thenceforward he came to be known as a traveller and a discoverer. But no man \u2022can say that he vvas less a missionary than before, or that the continuity of his life was in any sense broken, for his deepest wish w7as that by opening a highway, as it were, into those unex plored regions whither he turned his face, he might make it possible for those who came after him to carry thither that holy religion which lay so near to his heart. The story of his explorations has been told again and again, and it is no part of our work to tell it here. How We proudly go back to Blantyre and muse how, amid its quiet, the tender sap ling was reared which grew into such a mighty tree. TONA. \" Once the Luminary of the Caledonian Regions.\" \u2014 The Life and Death of St. Columba. HE late Dean Stan | ley, in his eloquent lectures on the Church of Scotland, . speaks of the \" im- mortal sentence that springs to the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and roving bar barians derived the benefits of knowledge and the blessings of religion. To abstract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible if it were endea voured, and would be foolish if it were possible.

Far from me and from my friends be such frigid philosophy as may conduct us. mind of every educated Eng lishman when Iona is men- Itioned.\" This same \"immortal sentence \" may well serve as a prelude to our article on Iona. \" We were now treading that illustrious island which was once the"], [488, "PICTURE SQ UE SCO TLAND. 464 indifferent and unmoved, over anyground which has been dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little to beenviedwhosepatriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.\" It would in deed be \"foolish to abstract the mind from all local emotion.\" Iona has little else to recommend it. This small island, three miles long and one mile broad, with some hills in it, may indeed obtain from the surrounding sea and sky many fine shades of light and colour ; but in itself munication easy, if communication were desirable, and it had sufficient fertility to enable the little community to live by their own labour. There are the remains of several ecclesiastical edifices on the island; but these, it is well to remember, have nothing to do with Columba. \"One of them,\" says the Duke of Argyle, \"the leastand mostinconspicuous, but the most venerable of them all, may possibly be the same which Queen Margaret of Scot land is known to have erected in memory of the Saint, and dedicated to one of the most famous of his companions. But \"OLD IONA'S HOLY FANE.\" it has nothing of the grandeur of Staffa, or parts of Skye, or the Shetland Islands. It is profoundly interesting for its memo ries, not for its natural scenery. It is the Holy Isle consecrated by the labours of Columba ; it is the home of Scottish Christianity ; it is the sepulchre where lie the ashes of her early kings. It is just such an island as we might choose for a monastic retreat. It is so far separated from the shore as to be beyond the reach of intrusion or disturbance. It is near enough to the larger island of Mull, and, through that to the mainland, to make com- Queen Margaret died in 1092, that is, 500 years after Columba's death, an interval of time as great as that between us and Edward III.\" At the time of Columba theonlyedificesupon it were wooden huts, and these must very soon have disap peared. According to some, there was here in very early times a sacred place of the Druids, but this is a mere suppo sition. St. Columba, Bede tells us, came to North Britain to preach the Gospel therein 565. He settled himself here, and formed an order of missionary monks, who"], [489, "IONA, 465 spread themselves over the mainland and the adjacent islands, converting the natives, and performing the simple rites of the Culdee Church. After thirty years of labour Columba died. The circum stances of his life and death are minutely related by Andamnan, his biographer, who also favours us with an account of the miracles he worked, and which are chiefly remarkable for their almost childish simplicity. Thus an account is given of the recovery of a staff, which, through some mischance, had been left behind. A prayer being offered up, the staff moved into the sea and sw'iftly floated away to its owner. As the end drew near a vision appeared to the saint and imparted the glad tidings of his speedy release from earthly cares. The brethren were informed, and were moved to despair, but he comforted them, and bade them be of good cheer. Even the animal creation participated in the grief caused by the coming sorrow. The old white horse which was kept at the mon astery approached him one day, and laying its head down in his lap as he rested by the path, wept tears of sorrow. It is said that Columba ascended a slight eminence, which can yet be traced, and uttered this prediction, which has been rendered as follows : \u2014 give when the storms of life are over, and when charity and peace are seen to be the great needs of earth.\" During the night Columba lay in that stupor which falls on men when hardly suf ficient strength remains in them to draw the few last bre aths of earthly air. At the dark hour before the dawn, when even the energies of men in health are at their lowest, there fell on his ears the sound of the matin bell calling the breth ren to devotion. The sound seemed to give the dying man fresh energy. He rose, and \"running before all others, entered the church alone,\" and there on the altar, whilst the\" earliest pipe of half awakened birds\" sounded strangely loud in the stillness, the brethren found him speechless and motionless. He had been some little time alone, for a light purer than that of an earthly dawn had gleamed within the chapel with an awful radiance that for a moment stayed the feet of the brethren. It faded, and the place was again dark. They pressed in, ashamed of the delay, and raised up the old man. He made some motion with his hand, as if to give them the sign of blessing, and then all was over. It vvas nearly the middle of June, and soon the morning light filled the building, but he had another morn than theirs. So, praying and working, lived and died Columba, the Apostle of the Scots, one of those men who make his tory. In him the religious history of Scotland began: a history which, as expressed in a variety of different forms and creeds \u2014 Culdee, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Latitudinarian \u2014 and full as it is of crimes and errors and blunders, and marred as it is by hypocrisy and fanaticism, yet, after every deduction, still remains the field on which has been exhibited everything that is best and highest, and deepest and noblest in Scotch nature. In Co lumba himself it may be truly said that all the best elements ot that religion were combined. Even the superstitious \" O sacred dome, and my beloved abode, Whose walls now echo to the praise of God ; The time shall come when lauding monks shall cease, And lowing herds shall occupy their place. But better ages shall hereafter come, And praise re-echo in this sacred dome.\" When he had said this he returned to his cell and occupied himself, ill and weak as he vvas, with the pious labour of transcribing the Holy Scriptures. He came to the words, \"There is no want to them that fear Him,\" and then he felt his strength utterly fail him, and \"Here,\" he said, \" I must stop.\" Lying in his bed he now dictated his last message to his faithful followers. \" It vvas in bubstance the old message which men like Columba"], [490, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 466 stories with which his life is surrounded have nothing unpleasing about them. There is a child-like simplicity in them ; they are the evident productions of an age of ignorance it is true, but of the happy ignorance that is refined by simple and pure faith. They have the first feeling* of a nation's dawn in them, and have the innocence of the tales of childhood. Columba was a g-enuine product of the Celtic nature in its highestform. Poorly as that nature acquits itself amidst the com monplace toil of a humdrum existence, such as it must always be the lot of the majority of men to lead, it is yet capable of an intensity of spiritual devotion, of a perfection of purity and divine self abnegation such as the gross and stolid Saxon is hardly capable of con ceiving, far less of attaining. This ab solute devotion to a great unselfish end is seen in every act of Columba's life, and this gives the whole a beautiful connection and harmony. Malcolm Canmore, the last of the specially Celtic kings, vvas interred at Dunfermline instead of here, and this marked, in a striking and impressive manner, the end of the old order of things in Scotland \u2014 the change from a purely Celtic to a Saxon, or at any rate a mixed rule. Iona was the burial-place of others besides Scottish monarchs. From great distances were here broug'ht the re mains of kings of Ireland, France, and Norway. Many of the Lords of the Isles were buried here, and the tombs are still shown of these, and of Abbots Mackinnon and Ken neth, of St. Oran, and of St. Columba himself \u2014 though it is supposed that the ashes of this saint were removed to Dun keld \u2014 and of the chiefs of the lines of Maclean, Macleod, and Macdonald, and many others. The island had by no means that quiet history which its repu tation deserved. At no distant date after Columba's death, the Norsemen, who proved so troublesome to the west coast of , Scotland, attacked it, slew many of the monks, and drove the rest away. The piety of a future generation reared nobler buildings on the sacred isle. Yet it vvas still exposed to visits, if not attacks, from the rude Norsemen. At the entrance to St. Oran's chapel \u2014 still remaining entire among the ruins \u2014 Magnus, King of Norway, struck by some sudden terror, drew hastily back and de parted, without harming the island, in 1098. And so, in some sort of fashion, the religious life of the place went on till the Reformation, when the remain ing foundations were summarily sup pressed. The island was gifted to the Argyle family, and in this it was so far fortunate. It was meet that a great his toric family, whose name is so entwined with the great events of Scottish history, should have the keeping of a spot of ground so important in that history. The present representative of that family has shown, by the interesting and scho- Scotland vvas not unmindful of her Apostle. The soil of Iona became holy ground, and in this sacred spot the Scot tish rulers of many generations were laid. It vvas thought that Iona was speci ally favoured of Heaven, and a Gaelic prophecy of dubious antiquity was quoted to show that in the time of the last convulsion it should be protected from the fate that was destined to overtake the neighbouring shores. Seven years before that awful day When Time shall be no more, A dreadful deluge shall o'ersweep Hibernia's mossy shore. The green-clad Isla, too, shall sink, While with the great and good, Columba's happy isle shall rear Her towers above the flood. It is the spot which Shakspeare mentions as assigned for the tomb ofthe murdered Duncan. He was to be \" Carried to Colm's-kill, The sacred storehouse of his ancestors, And guardian of their bones.\""], [491, "IONA 467 larly account which he has given of Iona, that its sacred soil is in reverent and worthy keeping. and a-half in circumference, on the capi tals of which are sculptured several gro tesque figures and devices in bas-relief. The tower is lighted above by two win dows, one of them circular, and of peculiar construction. In this Cathedral, various styles of architecture are ob served; the large east window is a beautiful specimen of Gothic workman ship. In the court of the Cathedral are two crosses; that called St. Martin's Cross is very elegant, and formed of one piece of red granite, fourteen feet high ; the other, called St. John's Cross, is much broken. Iona vvas not merely the seat of Scottish religion, but of Scottish learn ing. In its monastery were preserved \" the most ancient Scottish records, and its library is said to have con tained some valuable treasures of literature.\" The most remarkable of these treasures were the lost books of Livy. The famous \u00c6neas Sylvius, who afterwards as Pius II. filled the Papal chair, visited Scotland on an ecclesias tical mission in 1436. He intended to have gone to Iona and made a careful examination, but the murder of James I. prevented him. But there is no evidence to show that these books were really there. Indeed, \"the lost books of Livy \" were, like Prester John and the philoso pher's stone, one of the curious myths of the middle ages, and the search for them about as vague and hopeless as that for the fountain of eternal youth. We have already said a few words about St. Oran's Chapel, evidently the oldest of the many ruins upon the island. We shall now quote the following description of what still remains to be seen there. It is some years old, but it is pleasing to reflect that for these past years every thing has been done for the interesting island which the most reverent student of the past could desire. The high altar of white marble, which stood at the head of the chancel, has been removed piecemeal, from a super stitious notion that a fragment of it was a protection against shipwrecks and other calamities; but the font is in per fect preservation. Near to the place where the altar stood, on the north side of the choir, is a tombstone of black mar ble; on it is a fine figure of the Abbot M'Fingon, or Mackinnon, in his sacred robes, with the crosier in his hand, and with four lions at the angles. The stone is supported by four pedestals, about a foot high, and round the margin is this inscription: \u2014 ' Hie facet Johannes Mac- Fingon, abbas de Ji, qui obiit anno M.D. cujus animo propicietur altissimus. Amen! Opposite to this is a similar monument, executed in freestone, to the memory of the Abbot Kenneth, but it is much de faced; and on the floor is the figure of an armed knight. \" Of the venerable remains of antiquity in this island, the real dates are involved in obscurity. The Cathedral is said to have been rebuilt by Queen Margaret about the latter end ofthe eleventh cen tury. It is constructed of fine sienite, in the form of a cross, and dedicated to St. Mary. The length of the Cathedral, or Abbey Church, from east to west, is 160 feet, the breadth 24, and the length of the transept 70. Over the centre rises a handsome square tower, about 70 feet high, divided into three stories, and sup ported by four arches ; these arches rest on pillars about ten feet high, and eight Contiguous to the Cathedral are the remains ofthe cloisters, and also of the College, containing stone seats in niches for the disputants. At a short distance is shown a spot where lie concealed the sacred black stones upon which the Highland chieftains used to swear to an observance of contracts and alliances. On the north of the Cathedral are the remains of the bishop's house, with his grounds and garden still enclosed, and near to it is a cell said"], [492, "468 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. that overcame the refractory nature of the material in which they have been executed. Swords, ships, and armorial bearings, w*ith roughly-executed bas reliefs of warriors, form the chief objects of representation.\" to be the burial-place of Saint Co lumba. To the northward of the nunnery chapel are the remains of a causeway leading to the Cathedral, called the Main Street. It is joined by two others, one of them called the Royal Street, and the other Martyr Street, leading to the Bay of Martyrs, where it is said the illus trious dead were landed for interment. We shall conclude our account of Iona with those two fine sonnets which Wordsworth wrote after visiting the place : \u2014 On to Iona ! \u2014 what can she afford To us save matter for a thoughtful sigh Heaved over ruin, withstability In urgent contrast ? To diffuse the Word On the west side of Martyr Street is an elegant cross called M'Lean's Cross, being one of a great number standing at the time of the Reformation, but or dered to be demolished, by a decree of the Synod of Argyll, about the year 1560.\" (Thy paramount, mighty Nature ! and time's Lord) Her temples rose 'mid pagan gloom ; but why, Even for a moment, has our verse deplored Their wrongs, since they fulfilled their destiny ? And when, subjected to a common doom The nunnery chapel referred to in the above account vvas erected about the end of the twelfth century. It is in very good preservation, and within is the tomb of the Prioress Anna, of date 1 5 1 1 . The nuns, \"who followed the rule of St. Augustine,\" were the last ecclesias tical order who inhabited the island. During the turmoil of the Reformation they were quite forgotten, and it was only when things were settling dow7n again that this secluded \"nest of Popery\" \u2014 as the thorough-going ecclesiastics who then ruled over things spiritual in Scotland would have called it \u2014 vvas remembered, and the poor ladies were driven from their quiet retreat. The change vvas inevitable, and was one of those things that must happen in every great revolution; but it is impossible to refrain from lamenting so sad a fate. The nuns fell because others had sinned.

It is that striking change in popular taste, of which we have again and again had social conditions of the islands, and which are those of a shrewd and un prejudiced observer, or rather of a keen but kindly critic. No doubt the work"], [494, "470 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. occasion to speak, which has brought Fingal's Cave and the other treasures of Staffa into note. Men, wearied of the tame comforts of a luxurious civilisa tion, find a delight in gazing on these grander aspects of nature \u2014 aspects from which it would seem to be the dispo sition of the men that live among them to recoil with horror. One is inclined to begin a discussion as to where the proper standard in judging- scenery is situated \u2014 Is it in the mind of the observer or in the object observed ? is it mutable or constant? But this is not a trea tise on \u00c6sthetics or Metaphysics, so to ship ! to ship ! Standing on Iona we can see Staffa, which is but seven miles away. The island is of an oblong shape, and is very small, being only one mile long and half a mile broad. It is covered with grass, which affords a scanty pasture for a few sheep. \" It forms an uneven table-land, partly de clining to a rocky shore, but chiefly resting on mural columnar cliffs, pierced with caves.\" One reason of the compara tively late notice of Staffa is that its beauties are not seen from a distance ; one must be very close, within a quarter of a mile, indeed, before the remarkable caves, which are its great attraction, come into the view. Little more than a hundred years ago, Sir Joseph Banks, going to Iceland, came on it almost by chance. He contributed an account to Pennant's \"Tour to the Hebrides.\" This excited interest, and from that time it steadily grew in public notice, till now every year thousands of strangers from all parts of the world crowd to see it ; and it seems, even to a writer like the Duke of Argyle, to be quite natural that it should be to the great majority a place of much greater interest than Iona. cut straight, through vertically, and con sequently the wall of the cave has the appearance of a honeycomb. The cave is thirty feet in length, gradually con tracting as we go inland. Separated from the island by a narrow channel, through which the tide rushes rapidly, is a pile of columns forming a cone. These rest on some others, which are, however, only partially visible even at low water. It is called Booshala, or the Herdsman, probably from some supposed resemblance to a herd. But human limbs are hardly joined together with such mathematical regularity, nor do they exist in such colossal proportions. We may now sail along the colonnade of basaltic pillars. From out of the broken ends of pillars at the base of the island, which are in a great measure covered by the sea, there shoot up a great number of pillars in regular forms, which support a vast overhanging weight of rock, over which, in its turn, the verdure ofthe turf is spread. Some of these pillars are exceedingly regular ; others are not so, unless in the older guide-books, where man has improved on nature by so correcting the measure ments, that all the caves and pillars look as if drawn with line and compass, and without a spot to break this won derful regularity. The irregularity of Nature, however, is never a defect , and if we see this here by a broad sunlight, the very irregularities, by adding con trasts of light and shade to the pic ture, add greatly to the effect, and the exquisite purity of the water gives clear passage to the sunbeam that trembles in its depths. \"As the general surface is un dulating and uneven, great masses of light and shadow are thus produced. These breadths are further varied by secondary shadows and reflections, arising from smaller irregularities ; while the partial clustering of the columns produces a number of subsidiary groups, which are not only highly beautiful both in them selves and as they combine with and The first cave we shall visit is the Clamshell or Scallop Cave, so called because one of the sides is scooped out in regular ribbed lines like a clam shell. On the other side the columns are as if"], [495, "THE ISLAND OF STAFFA. 471 melt into the larger masses, but which entirely remove that dryness and for- mality which are produced by the incessant repetition of vertical lines and equal members.\" But the great attraction of Staffa is Fingal's or the Great Cave. The very name shows lhat though Staffa \"vvas only known to the rude islanders,\" still it must have had some effect on them. This remark- able opening has been fitly compared to the nave of a cathedral, of which the sea is the floor, and the ever-varying voice of wind and wave the organ and choir. On each side rise a vast number of columns. These support the arch of \"that species of Gothic work which has been termed the contracted.\" The columns that support the sides are very regular; but not so abso- lutely regular as to produce a mono- tonous effect. They are accurately arranged in different groups, which adds wonderfully to the general effect. The arch of the roof has a more varied appearance than the columns. It is deeply channeled in the middle by a fissure parallel to the sides, and pro- longed from the point of the exterior arch to the end. The rising and falling of the waves at the base of the columns, and the various shades of reflected light which they produce, are among the most striking impressions which a visit to this cave leaves in ' the mind. Of measurement we may give the following: From top of cliff to arch, 30 feet ; from arch to average water level, 60 feet. Breadth at entrance, and for a good way in, 42 feet ; whole length of cave, 227 feet. Perhaps the most striking view is from the inside, looking back. The light is then more available. The great extent of the cave lies before us, with the ocean forming a majestic back ground, and away in the distance we easily catch a glimpse of the old grey tower of sacred Iona. there are several other caves which might have, been distinguished in a less famed spot. Thus there is the Cormo rants' or McKinnon's Cave, of which the entrance is noted for its great size. \"The broad, black shadow,\" says Chambers, \" produced by the great size of the aperture, gives a very powerful effect to all these views of the point of the island, into which it enters ; and is no less effective at land by relieving the minute ornaments of the columns which cover it.\" The cave is noted for the almost perfect regularity of its structure. The same may also be said of the Boat Cave, a long narrow opening into the land. The interior is somewhat gloomy, as the entrance is so overhung as to prevent the free access of light. MacCul loch notes a strange effect which the heaving of the sea produced in one of the caves. \"As I sat on one of the columns,\" he says, \"the long swell raised the water, at intervals, up to my feet, and then subsiding again, left me suspended high above it; while the silence of these movements, and the apparently undisturbed surface of the sea, caused the whole ofthe cave to feel like a ship heaving in a sea-way.\" The situation of Staffa and Iona, within sight of each other, is a very striking one. They are both deeply interesting, and yet their interest is of an entirely different kind. In one case it is historical, in the other natural, and probably something as to the disposition of a man might, with tolerable certainty, be inferred from the manner in which he viewed these two remarkable islands. We conclude with a few lines from Scott, in whose verse there is a fine, free, vigorous dash, so that we have the very rush of the waves and whistle of the sea-breeze. Merrily, merrily goes the bark On a breeze from the northward free.

This is indeed the thing that fixes most places Two Days in Arran consists of two or three huts on a hill- side. We sailed over in the steamer from Ardrossan to Brodick, respectfully admired the new hotel, which we (some- what rashly, for we were a set of poverty- stricken students) entered, were vvell entertained and well charged, and then set off in a boat, and rowed round, in the evening, under the shadow of the moun- tains, to Corrie, and thence climbed up to High Corrie. Living there gives one the notion of being perched \u2014 not quite securely \u2014 somewhere between the sky and the sea, and a severe gale of wind, or perhaps a touch of an earthquake, would apparently have plunged us down hopelessly, or shaken us off like ripe apples from an overladen tree. This was absurd, for the huts had stood many rough winters, and we suppose still stand them, but so it appeared to us. The whole hillside was full of burns, and they kept sounding through the silent night \u2014 when not silenced by the louder voice of the wind \u2014 making a sort of background to our dreams. Pleasant was the morning plunge in the deep cold water of those Highland burns; pleasant the climb up Goat Fell, and the far-stretching panorama that spread itself out before us from the top; pleasant, too, the wander through Glen Rosa, in the memory of most people. There is by no means a perfect fitness in such matters. We have not always the deepest memories connected with the best scenery and most important places. Even poets are not consistent in their choices, or, being divinely mad, can not rule their inspiration. What's Yarrow but a river bare That glides the dark hills under ? Tfcsre are a thousand such elsewhere As worthy of your wonder. No doubt, save that every rock and tree and burn has been sung so sweetly, that the vale has a greater interest for men than far grander scenes.

These give to the island a \" lofty serrated outline,\" from the sea and the adjacent land, whilst they contain many lochs and glens, alike of quiet beauty and wild grandeur. Arran ! a single-crested Tenerisse, A St. Helena next \u2014 in shape and hue Varying her crowded peaks and ridges blue, Who but must covet a cloud-seat, or skiff Built for the air, or winged Hippogriff, That he might fly, where no one could pursue, From this dull monster and her sooty crew, And as a god light on thy topmost cliff? Impotent wish 1 which reason would despise If the mind knew no union of extremes, No natural bond between the boldest schemes Ambition forms and heart humilities. Arran is still, in many respects, a somewhat primitive place. This to the stranger is one of its chief charms ; but at the beginning of the present century things were a good deal more primitive than they are at the present day, when Arran has steamship and telegraphic communication with the mainland. In 1807 one Headrick inspected those parts, and his report has been thus condensed : \"Roads for wheeled vehicles had only begun to exist. Sledges, and baskets slung over the backs of horses, or on those of women, supplied the place of carts. The natives spoke the Gaelic language, drank home-made whisky, and frequently wore untanned shoes of their own cobbling. The cosy ancestral hut, with chimney in the centre of the apartment, whose window was the smoke hole in the roof, still prevailed. Farms were held by communities; the runrig system (rig about, hence common risk from fire and sword) yet in use; fields were unenclosed ; uncultivated lands common \u2014 all parties having grounds adjoining them being free to send to them as many animals as they pos sessed.\" Beneath stern mountains many a soft vale lies And lofty springs give birth to lowly streams. But we are getting rather high up, and unless we want to be surrounded by mist (which, by the way, used sometimes to lap us in of a morning at High Corrie, till we seemed to live in Cloud land), w7e had better set about a more prosaic description of the island. Arran belongs to the county of Bute. Its breadth is eleven, its length twenty miles. The name means sharp-peaked. There are various remains in the island, which tell us that it must have been occupied from a very early period ; but what its history then was can only be guessed. The principal after historical events are the half-mythical adventures of King Robert Bruce, and these we shall have occasion to refer to in connection with some of the localities. The island also holds some dim tradition of the great Fingal. About the mythical nature of his wan derings there is no doubt at all. The mention of Arran naturally recalls that member of the great ducal house of Hamilton who vvas Regent of Scotland in Oueen Mary's time \u2014 almost the whole of the island is now part of the vast possessions of that family. The o*reat thing about Arran is its hills. We have already quoted Smith's say- The parts in Arran usually visited first are, Goat Fell, Glen Sannax, to the north of it, and Glen Rosa, to the south. Goat Fell is not the mountain of the goat, but the windy mountain. The \"goat\" is a corruption of the first part of Gaoth-bheim, the Celtic name. The ascent presents no great difficulty, though the way is somewhat steep. As you go up, the various peaks seem to disentangle themselves from the mass, and stand out clear and bold. The summit is bare rock, without vegetation"], [498, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 474 streams fall into the river that runs through this glen, and if we follow these upwards we find that they almost invariably take their rise in some high-lying and secluded loch, situated amidst a scene of wild beauty. If we follow the river to the coast, a distance of four or five miles, we again strike the high roaci, which runs right round the island. To the north of the island is a narrow but beautiful opening on the coast, known as Loch Ranza. Brodick Castle is on the other side of the island. This, which Barbour describes as a \" stith castell of stane,\" is still standing. Most of it has again and again been rebuilt, but some parts of the more ancient edifice yet re main, and there is a table in it round which \"the royal exile and his trusty friends were .wont to sit and quaff their wine, drinking revenge to Scotland's foes.\" The authority given for this ex traordinary story is \"local tradition.\" It was from the wall of this castle that Bruce looked eagerly for the sign which was to summon him to the mainland. There is a very palpable imitation of the old ballad, which, notwithstanding, is very good ringing verse, just, we suppose, as some Wardour - street Vandykes and Rubenses are very good paintings, and which thus narrates the incident : \u2014 of any kind. On a very clear day the mountains of Man (ioo miles away!) are said to be visible. But the climber may think himself exceptionally fortunate if he catch a glimpse of the mountains of Mull, and to the east, still further off, those of Morvern, Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond, and Ben Ledi, with Ben Lawers rising behind these last. On the west a considerable portion of the Irish coast is also visible.' The view from a lower point, the head of the Whitewater Glen, though much more limited, is yet preferred by some, who \"consider it an illustration of the rule, that in Alpine districts the finest views are not obtained from the summits of the mountains, but from some one or other of the lower peaks. Here huge grey rocks tower far aloft on either side, great savage mountains so high and yet so near are all around, the yawning depths of Sannax beneath ; wild desolation everywhere, while the hush of perfect stillness is only broken by the hoarse gurgling murmurs of the far-distant running waters.\" Walking along the coast north from Corrie, we soon come to the huge rock ing-stone \u2014 thirty tons in weight \u2014 that adorns the entrance to Sannax. The view at the beginning is very fine, it then falls off somewhat, but as one penetrates further into the deeper recesses, we have one of the most remarkable views to be obtained in Scotland. According to MacCulloch, \" It is the sublime of magnitude, and simplicity, and obscurity and silence.\" If one can endure the fatigue, it is desirable to cross the shoulder of the intervening mountain, and descend Glen Rosa, where the scenery is of a somewhat softer, but not less pleasing character. Behind Glen Rosa is Ben Noosk, which contains the highest precipice in the island. It is a favourite haunt of the ravens. Descend ing the other side of this mountain we reach Glen Torsa, which lies between Ben Noosk and Gille Chamigil.

It was in Arran that the well-known spider in cident occurred.-. On the west coast is the King's Cave, where his majesty \"put up \" when he could do no better, and the place where he embarked for the mainland is marked by a standing stone, of which, by the way, there are a good number in the island. Brodick, though the most famous, is not the only castle in the island. To the south, on a \"pre cipitous cliff of trap,\" fronting the island of Plada, is a ruined square tower of four storys, called the Castle of Kildonan. It is quite in the style of the old period. It is picturesque enough, both in situation and plan, but must have been abominably uncomfortable to live in. Far better the prosaic comforts of Lamlash Hotel, than the faded glories of Kildonan Castle. Alas ! \" the age of chivalry \" is gone, and men pre fer the comfortable to the picturesque. After all, men were of the same opinion then \u2014 in fact, it is not probable that they had even the notion of the picturesque to console them ; but they could not help themselves. Loch Ranza and Lamlash also boast remains of castles, which we shall content ourselves with thus mention ing. tures in Arran, though not imposing, are ancient and curious. North-vvest of Lamlash is the old church of Kilbride. It is roofless, and \"its massive, unchiselled walls, with their small arched doors and windows, and the general features of the building, indicate a venerable antiquity.\" In the adjoining burial-ground there are many quaintly sculptured stones ; but the designs are wellnigh illegible from exposure and neglect. The remains of chapels at Glenasdale, Kilmorie, Shis kin, and the traditions of others now quite destroyed, are a proof of the abundance of provision at an early period for the spiritual needs ofthe inhabitants. The ruins of the chapel in the margin of Loch Ranza remind us of the scene in \"The Lord of the Isles,\" when Bruce seeks his sister, which is supposed to have happened here. Arran has long been a happy hunting-ground. Fingal roamed over its hills with his dogs, the Scottish kings retired here to pursue the deer, and at the present day it is used for this purpose chiefly by the owner. Were it in the hands of a number of proprietors, it would soon be opened up, be the seat of flourish ing watering-places and busy trading. Whether this would be for good or ill is a question which will be answered differently according to the different tastes of those who discuss the matter.

The height of the rock from the water is 1,000 feet, and it is two miles in circumference. Its upper part is cone-shaped, like a sugar-loaf. Its lower part is partly precipitous, partly columnar. A cave penetrates a great way into the interior, and the top is covered with the richest and most various vegetation, which is fed upon by a large number of goats and rabbits. These are but a part of the living in habitants of the craig, which gives a home to great masses of sea-birds, amongst which solan geese, gannets, and puffins may be specially mentioned. It is only possible to ascend the rock from the side towards Ayr county, from which it is fifteen miles distant. Moreover, to ascend to the top is rather a stiff pull. The path is obstructed by loose stones, which often roll from be neath you when you put your foot on them, and the rank vegetation grows over the road. There are some build ings on the rock, but what they were meant for is not quite certain; probably there was an intention, at one time, to fortify the island, or to hold it as a point of observation. Of a chapel said once to exist here, there is now no trace. The rock gives his title to a British peer, the Marquis of Ailsa. We have already come across the family under another name, as the reader may perhaps re member, when we quote the various honours now held by the house \u2014 Baron Kennedy, 1452; Earl of Cassilis, 1509 \u2014 Scottish honours ; Baron Ailsa in the peerage of the United Kingdom, 1806, and Marquis of Ailsa, 1831. rocks, rising abruptly from the sea, and that they are both much favoured of the solan geese. They are on op posite sides of Scotland, and whilst AilsaCraigis the more remarkable, from thepointof view of scenic effect, the Bass has certainly got a more impressive history. Like Holyrood and Edinburgh Castle, and the churchyard of old Greyfriars, it is one of the \" sacred spots \" of Scottish history. Ailsa Craig \u2014 to take it first \u2014 lies off the coast of Ayrshire ; it vvas thus natural that it should occur as a simile to Burns. As it towered out of the sea it suggested to his mind obduracy and obstinacy. Hence \"Meg was deaf as Ailsa Craig.\" According to MacCulloch, \"owing to the beauty of the local colour, the mild tones of grey interspersed with greens of every description, the columnar ranges of Ailsa produce an effect superior to those of Staffa, of the Shiant Islands, and of Skye \u2014 the uniform dark hues of these, without variety or contrast, often confounding the whole in indiscriminate gloom.\" And Keats speaks of it in not less estimation in verse : \u2014 Hearken, thou craggy Ocean pyramid ! Give answer from thy voice, the sea-fowls' screams ! When were thy shoulders mantled in huge streams ? When, from the sun, was thy broad sorehead hid ? How long is 't since the mighty power bid Thee leave the airy sleep from fathom dreams? Sleep in the lap of thunder or sunbeams, Or when grey clouds are thy cold coverlid ? Thou answer'st not, for thou art dead asleep ! Thy life is but two dead eternities \u2014 The last in air, the former in the deep ;"], [501, "AILSA CRAIG AND THE BASS. 477 So much for Ailsa. We pass now right across Scotland, to say a word or two about another rock-island, which, though far off from Ailsa geographi cally, takes a place beside it in our minds, the \" Bass Rock,\" a huge mound of basalt, 400 feet high, which stands off the coast of East Lothian. Here dwelt St. Baldred, East Lothian's Apostle, they say, in the days of the past, so long ago as the sixth century. And long after those days, though, as it seems to us, at a very ancient time, James I. of Scotland, the poet-king, spent some time waiting till a ship vvas got ready to convey him to France. In after-Reformation times, Charles II. bought it as a state prison, and unwittingly honoured it by making it the place of confinement of some brave Covenanters. Now it may be said that the tenants of the Bass are the solan geese, large white birds, which are supposed to derive their name from the solitary egg which each lays. Seen from a distance, the face of the Bass is perfectly white from the abundance of these birds. The poets have been at tracted, as one might vvell expect, by this remarkable rock standing out to sea \u2014 an object which strikes you from every point of view, whether you are close by it, or gazing upon it perhaps from far-off Arthur's Seat. Home, who, in his \"manse\" at Athelstaneford, was not far distant, thus refers to it in the tragedy of \" Douglas\" : \u2014 The fierce Dane Upon the eastern coast of Lothian landed, Near to that place where the sea-rock immense, Amazing Eass looks o'er a fertile land. And Scott, in \"Marmion,\" thus cele brates it and the twin height of North Berwick Law, which rises from behind the town which gives it a name : \u2014 And now when close at hand they saw North Berwick's town and lofty Law, Fitz-Eustace bade them pause awhile Before a venerable pile, Whose turrets viewed afar, The lofty Bass, the Lambie Isle. The ocean's peace or war. To enable the reader to picture this huge rock to his mind's eye, nothing could be better than the description given by Hugh Miller: \u2014 \"The sloping ac clivity of the Bass consists of three great steps or terraces, with steep belts of precipice rising between; of these the lowest is occupied by the fortress, and furnishes, where it sinks slopingly 50 the sea, on the south-east, the two landing places to the island. The middle ter race, situated exactly over a great cave perforated by the sea, has furnished a site for the ancient chapel, while the upper and largest terrace, lying but a single step below the summit of the rock, we find laid out in a levelled enclosure, once a garden.\""], [502, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 478 OLD BRIDGE, DALMALLY, NEAR LOCH AWE.

The reader can perhaps imagine the long sheet of water winding in and out be- tween the heather-clad hills, even if he has not seen it.' Probably the reader has been there, for it is no difficult task to get to Loch Awe nowadays. This vvas not always so. Long ago, when a Campbell was threatened, he would reply with his defiant war-cry, \"It's a far cry to Loch Awe,\" by which he meant that the foes of the clan would find it no very easy matter to get to this far-off country of Loch Awe, where the Campbells' home was, and that even when they had got there they might not be inclined to felicitate themselves upon the achievement. It is quite easy now for friends and foes to get to Loch Awe ; but as the Campbells do not expect to be attacked in the old fashion, this does not, perhaps, matter. It is still, we pre- sume, as difficult to get the better of them as ever it was, so \" It is still a far cry to Loch Awe.\" There vvas a time, says the old tradition, when Loch Awe did not exist. In its place there was a deep valley, and in the valley a spring. At this period a race of giants inhabited the land, and they had for their dwelling the lofty heights of Ben Cruachan. The vale vvas filled with their flocks, and they passed their time in hunting over the hills. One sacred duty they were bound to perform. This vvas to guard the fatal fountain which vvas mysteriously connected with the destinies of their race. The last ray of the sun at evening, the first gleam in the morning must not be suffered to touch the water. To prevent this a large stone was laid over the fountain every evening before sunset, and removed next morning im- mediately after sunrise. This was duly performed for ages; but at last a time came when there vvas but one representa tive of the race, the giantess Bera, who was so mighty that she could step from the summit of one mountain to that of another at a single stride. Her favou rite occupation vvas hunting, and it came about that once in the heat of summer, after a fatiguing day's chase, she sat down to rest for a little. The sun was still high in the heavens, and there seemed plenty of time to lay the stone correctly, but she fell into a deep sleep, and did not waken till next morning, when the sun was shining high in the sky. She looked around her, but hardly knew where she was, so changed vvas the scene. A vast sheet of water now filled the valley. Many of the lesser hills were changed into islands. The flocks which pas tured on their sides were all washed away. As she looked in dismay on the ruin which her carelessness had caused, she felt the strength ebbing away from her, and she recognised her doom. Her life vvas bound up with the life of the spring; as it had changed, so had she, and soon she lay down to die on the hillside. Her race ended with her, and Loch Awe is their only memorial. Of the numerous islands in the Loch some are worthy of something more than a passing notice. The beautiful island of Inishail vvas the home of a con gregation of Cisterian nuns. Hay, Abbot of Inchaffry, had changed with the times, embraced the new faith and the life of a layman, and was rewarded with the revenues of this little foundation. Till 1736 the building on it vvas used as a parish church, but now a few stones are all that remain. On this sacred spot has been laid the dust of many genera tions of the surrounding inhabitants. A sweet spot to rest in after life's fitful fever ! \" The island is all one blue field of flowers, as if the sky had fallen ; it is always so in spring; in summer it is covered with green fern; and in autumn, when the fern dies, it reddens the whole island.\" \" Was it not vvell,\""], [504, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 480 goes on Mr. Hamerton, in his charming \"Painter's Camp in the Highlands,\" \"in barbarous mountaineers, to bury their dead in lovely isles, where the fort of the marauder trampled not the grass on the grave, and where the living came not save in sorrow and reverently ? The mainland vvas for the living to fight upon, but this green isle was the silent land, the island of the blest.' Hither the chieftains came, generation after genera tion, borne solemnly across the waters from their castellated isles ; hither they came to this defenceless one, where they still sleep securely, when their strongholds are roofless ruins, and their claymores dissolved in rust.\" of the heroines of romance, pined away and died; the golden apples and the magic garden vanished with the dragon, and Frooch Eilan became as other islands. All this happened long before the castle was built, and yet it is old enough too. Alexander III. gifted it in the royal way that kings had in those days to Gilbert Macnaughton, chief of his clan, on condition that when the King of Scotland should go by Loch Awe the said Gilbert, his heirs and suc- cessors, should entertain him. We are unable to say whether any King of Scotland ever did pass that way, but in the '45, it vvas supposed that Prince Charles Stewart might possibly do so, and the then possessor, who was a staunch Jacobite, made every preparation to give him a suitable reception. Another island quite close is Frooch. There are the ruins of an old keep on it, but the boatman may tell you a story of a time long before the first stone of the keep vvas laid. Even now Frooch is beautiful, but its beauty was once some thing more than earthly, for it held an enchanted garden, and he who sailed past could catch a gleam of the golden apples that bloomed ever fair on the trees, and perhaps get a glimpse of the dragon \"horrible and stern, \" that watched over them \u2014 could see him flap the air lazily with his huge tail, or open his enor mous mouth in a very threatening and significant manner, if the careless sailor approached too near. Now at this period there lived on the slope of Ben Cruachan, just where the base is washed by the swift rushing flow of the Awe, a fair maiden called Mego. Mego had everything a reasonable maiden could wish for, and yet (or, perhaps, therefore) was not happy. And nothing would serve her but to have one of the golden apples. So she ordered the brave Frooch, her lover, to get one for her, and he, foolish youth, swore to do so, dragon or no dragon. So he swam to the island, and he and the dragon fell to with right good will, and fairly bela boured the life out of one another. Mego, after the most approved fashion \" Tangled shrubs and old writhing trees \" now overrun the whole island. An ash-tree grows over the hearth-stone of the Castle, whilst the whole of the ruin is full of the nests of wild birds, which come up from the sea, and build here as on the other islands of Loch Awe, reminding one of the Scriptural sign of desolation \u2014 \"Both the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it, the owl and the raven shall dwell in it.\" Inishconnel and Inisheraith also hold ruins of castles and religious foundations. but the chief ruin on the lake is that of Kilchurn Castle, which lies at the north of it, on the east side. It is built on a rock, which tradition and geology alike tell us was once an island. Still enough remains of the walls to give us an idea of the stately nature of the fortress, which, according to the best critics, is seen to most advantage when the wind is driving the white-capped waves across the loch, and the dark clouds across the sky.> The grim old ruin then fits in with the wild scene much better than it does with the placid beauty of a summer even ing. Wordsworth has written some fine poetry about Kilchurn, but it has this disadvantage, that it is so vague that it"], [505, "IN THE LAND OF LORNE. 481 might apply to any castle on any loch, The prose account in the Journal is brief but graphic : \u2014 \" From the top of the hill a most impressive scene opened upon our view \u2014 a ruined castle on an island (for an island the flood had made it) at some distance from the shore, backed by a cone of the mountain Cruachan, down which came a foaming stream.

One of them, on Loch Etiveside, rises grandly between us and the sea. .We see nearly the whole length of Loch Awe, the upper end of Loch Etive, and the great calm ocean in the west, dim with heat and vapour, with mountainous islands rising out of it mys teriously. But to the east are the High land hills clear and sharp in their in numerable multitude of peaks \u2014 some brilliant with snow, others pale with inconceivable distance, all various with exquisite changefulness of hue, pale pur ples and tender greens, and faraway the hues of heaven itself, rose and blue of ineffable delicacy. completed, and so it remains. \"Time,\" says Robert Buchanan, in his \" Land of Lome,\" \"has dealt gently with it, merely pencilling the walls with soft lichens and golden moss; and so far as Time is concerned, it may be a ghost in the moonlight for a thousand years to come.\" Those who travel by Loch Awe will scarcely leave it without ascending Ben Cruachan, which rises at the north-west corner of the Loch to the height of 3,667 feet. The best side to ascend is the south, where the slope is comparatively easy. On the other side the climb is steeper and more direct. Near the top there are some dangerous precipices, but as the ground there is clear, there is no danger unless there be a mist, or unless the traveller is foolhardy. Lower down, the mountain is richly wooded, the trees extending down to the very edge of the Loch. The summit is double, as the peak breaks into two at some dis tance from the top. The view from the top is famous even among Highland views. It is thus described by Mr. Ham erton, with the keen insight of the painter, and the fine touch of true literary per ception, for the writer is an artist in words as vvell as in colours : \u2014 \u25a0 The great lake spreads out below us, calm like a sea of glass. It stretches far away into the pale haze of the high horizon ; and on its whole length, from end to end, not a single breeze dims its exquisite surface. Floating on it, like fallen leaves in a still basin in a garden, lie the green isles. The moors are spotted with miniature lochs, set like shining mirrors in the hot heath. There is a long line of glittering white on the mysterious Atlantic. In half an hour the sun will set.\" \" We rest at last on the summit. The effect of the Highlands of Scotland seen from one of their highest peaks resem bles nothing so much as the ocean in a gale of wind, fixed for ever in a photo graph. It is a sea of mountains, sublime in its variations and in the huge propor tions of its granite waves, yet not satisfac tory to the artistic sense. It offers a splendid panorama, but not a picture. The' sweetest, and even the sublimest pictures are laid in the habitable earth, and we need not go to the snowy sum mits to seek them. Still, if you would feel the immensity of the world, go to the mountain-tops, and reflect that the vast circumference of your horizon is but a round spot on its mighty sphere. Loch Awe is fed by the river Urchay. It flows from the little Loch Tulla for about twelve miles through Glenurchay. At first it is extremely rapid, at one place, indeed, it forms a sort of rapid, though the volume of water is not great enough to make this impos ing. The fall when it approaches the Loch is gentle, and it almost impercep tibly mingles with the greater volume of water. It does not run through the Loch for any distance, but about four miles from the place where it falls in, it again emerges on the opposite side, running* thus across, not along, the Loch. It is now known as the Awe.

The hills close in round the loch, and cast their dark shadows on the water. \"The rocks and bays on the shore, which might elsewhere attract attention, are here swallowed up by the enormous dimensions of the surrounding mountains, and the wide and ample expanse of the lake. A solitary house at the top is only visible when at the upper extremity, and if there be a tree, as there are in a few places on the shore, it is unseen, extinguished as if it were a humble mountain flower by the universal magnitude around.\" OCH Etive, into which we have come with the River Awe, is one of those indenta tions of the sea which, on the west coast of Scotland, run up into the land, and which have all the characteris tics of inland lochs, save that their water is salt, and that they feel the influence ofthe tidal wave. In the far recesses the water is brackish, and the influence of the tide much less strongly felt. Loch Etive is about twenty-two miles long. It is very narrow, and as it is bounded by lofty mountains on both sides, it has a peculiarly wild and desolate appear ance. At Connel, where the loch proper may be said to begin, the channel is not more than two hundred yards wide, and the greater portion of this is obstructed by a line of reefs, which are submerged at high water. 'Both at the ebb and flow of the tide, the water, not finding sufficient passage through the narrow channel, rushes over the ledge of rock, forming a sort of marine cataract. As you advance you come to a broader part of the loch, which is here fully a mile across. The banks are now beauti fully wooded, and the slope of the hills There are one or two places vvell worth notice on the shores of Loch Etive. First there is Beregonium, situated on the northern side of the entrance to the loch. This, according to \" tradition, ignorance, or knavery,\" as Chambers somewhat roughly says, vvas the seat of the capital of Fergus, the first king of the Scots, at a period of time a good many centuries before the Christian Era. The only remains that have ever existed to prove the town are \u2014 (1) the remains of some vitrified forts; (2) some mounds said to be the remains of a paven causeway ; (3) \"and the discovery"], [508, "484 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. would be very difficult to surprise it from the land side. The rock on which it is built is so sloped by nature or art that it seems to form one part with the building itself, and though the land approach is not striking, yet, seen from the sea, w'hen the traveller is sailing towards the entrance of Loch Etive, it presents a very noble appearance. A number of steps, rudely hewn out ofthe rock, give access to it from the water. Although even tradition does not ven ture to make Dunstaffnage as old as Beregonium, still it assigns to it a very respectable antiquity. It was built by Evanus first, \"about the time of Julius C\u00e6sar.\" It was for long a royal resi dence and sacred burying-place of the ancient kings of these parts. Here was kept, as we have already mentioned, the famous Stone of Destiny, till, in 843, it was removed to Scone by Kenneth McAlpine, when that monarch changed the seat of government to the Perthshire town. We know, by the structure ofthe present building, that it cannot have been in existence at that time ; but it is not at all improbable that there was another previous structure on the site. in the moss of what antiquarians have been pleased to term a piece of a bored wooden pipe for conveying water, but which vvas, in reality, only the trunk of a rotten tree decayed in the centre.\" This \"wooden pipe,\" even on the most favourable supposition, proves nothing, as the Picts, whoever they were, and what ever their skill, can hardly have been further advanced in their knowledge of the laws of hydrostatics than the Romans. There are two hills at this place \u2014 neither of them high \u2014 and called respectively the Hill of the Son of Sna chan, and the King's Own Hill. Here lay Beregonium, or Balanree (the King's Own Hill), and here the earliest of the shadowy kings of a shadowy race were fabled to have lived in a style that far outdid the magnificence of later days. So far tradition. Let us now observe how this pleasing legend is disposed of by Mr. Skene in his great work on Celtic Scotland: \u2014 \"The first of our historians to make use of Ptolemy (the Roman geographer) was Hector Boece, but he placed his names too far north. He puts the Brigantes in Galloway, and the Novantes in Kintyre, and hence their towns are placed in Argyll instead of Wigtown. The Ulm edition of 1486, which is a very inaccurate one, was apparently the edition used by Boece, and in it the name Rerigonium is mis printed Beregonium. Boece applied the name to the vitrified remains, the correct name of which vvas Dunmhicuis-neachan, the fort of the sons of Uisneach, now corrupted into Dunmacsniochan, and thus arose one of the spurious traditions created by Boece' s history. We find it at the time of the Scottish Wars of Independence in the possession of the Lords of Lome. In 1305 it was besieged and taken by Robert Bruce. between whom and the then Lords of Lome there was deadly enmity. Dun staffnage has a rather memorable history in the records of rebellions. It vvas here that Donald, Lord of the Isles, collected his forces to war against James II., and it was here that, in a later age, the Earl of Argyle landed to begin that unfortunate attempt in savour of the Duke of Mon mouth which was to end by bringing him to the block. For centuries before this time it had passed into the hands ot the powerful Campbell family, who hold it to this day. It was garrisoned by them on various occasions, especially in the '15 and the '45, as a protection to their surrounding territories. Nominally A little more substantial \u2014 though with a good deal of mythical history about it likewise \u2014 is Dunstaffnage, which is situ ated at the entrance to Loch Etive, and on the other side from Beregonium.

The following account of its present condition is interesting : \u2014 \" The real right, however, is in the depute keeper, Sir Donald Campbell. Bart., to whose family it vvas assigned as an appanage at an early period. The original part of the building was con sumed by fire in 1715, but what remains bears marks of extreme antiquity. It is square in form, with round towers at three of the angles, and is situated upon a lofty precipice, carefully scarped upon all sides to render it perpendicular. The entrance is by a staircase, which con ducts to a wooden landing in front of the portal. This landing could formerly be raised at pleasure, on the plan of a drawbridge. When thus raised the only access was under an arch, with a low vault (the porter's lodge) on the right hand, flanked by loopholes, through -which any visitor could be fired upon. This arch gives admission to the inner court, which is about eighty feet square, and contains two mean-looking modern buildings. There is a splendid prospect from the battlements.\" remember to have seen in the churchyard of a little Lowland town (where probably it still stands) a peculiarly ludicrous instance of this. It was a tombstone origi nally intended for a gardener, and vvas as remarkable a specimen of \" eighteenth century work\" \u2014 if it was not a little later \u2014 as could vvell be conceived. It was covered with rude representations of the implements of gardening, and with still ruder representations of beings \u25a0 \u2014 whether terrestrial or celestial, gar deners or cherubs, it was impossible to tell. Had this work of art been left to Nature, it would have had a gentle veil of delicacy thrown over its more obtru sive features, have lost its original vulgarity, and even have had a certain quaint interest. But in this case it had come into the hands of some frugal mourner, who had erected it anew, after a grand restoration with paint and chisel, and a new inscription to the memory of the deceased, who (to add an additional touch of unfitness) vvas not a gardener at all. Thus those who de pleted Iona in this remarkable manner were no worse than their neighbours. It might even, indeed, be argued that their intentions were laudable, and that their veneration for the old sculptures vvas thus most strikingly exhibited. Whether this be so or no, it is evident that the real parties to blame in such matters are the better educated and more wealthy inhabitants of the district. It is not to be expected that those whose whole lives are spent in a hard fight against poverty should be profoundly interested in arch\u00e6ological pursuits, or generally in the preservation of ancient monuments. Yet we need hardly say that it is of the utmost importance that these should be preserved. Not only are they interesting in themselves, but they often throw a most valuable light on the history of a country. We ought surely to look to those who, often deriving a large revenue from the district in which these are situated, at the same time are Near to this ruin there is another ruin, of more sacred, if of less general interest. It is that of a little chapel. The adjoin ing ground is still used as a graveyard by the people of the neighbourhood, and it must be one of the very oldest in Scotland, for here, at a very early period, many of the Scottish kings were buried. A strange piece of vandalism used to be perpetrated here, which, we are glad to say, is now quite a thing of the past. When the inhabitants wished to erect a gravestone over a dead rela tive, they used to go to Iona, and take one of the beautifully sculptured stones from there, bring it back, and stick it over the grave of their late friend.

We suppose hotel-keepers never travel any great distance, at least we should hope not, for if those of Switzerland, or France, or Germany once took a tour in the Highlands, they would feel, as Lord Clive says he did when he remembered the unlimited amount of \"loot\" which he might have seized, but did not, in the treasure stores of the Indian princes, and \" be astonished at their own moderation,\" and returning to their native soil vow henceforth to cast mo desty and moderation (qualities with which the world had not hitherto credited them) to the winds, and follow the noble example set them in the land of Fingal and Rob Roy. It is here the Lowlander and the Cockney begins his Highland journey. Often have we stood on the pier, or strolled by the rail way station, and viewed hosts of fresh men from distant London land on this terra incognita. They are wonderfully clad in suits of a pattern that they fondly imagine to be the orthodox tartan of some of the aboriginal clans. Their speech is soft and smooth, and in a few cases (do not let us be unjust to the Cockney, and say in more than a few cases) the h's and r's are displaced with mathematical regularity. They are small, and somewhat stunted of stature, and show unfavourably as compared with the stalwart seamen and porters who hover round them, but they are good-humoured and easy-going, disposed to be generous or reckless as only English and American people are gene rous or reckless, and so they are received with open arms. Here they learn many wonderful things, as, for instance, that London is one of the cheap places of the world, and that the comforts and luxuries of the modern restaurant are to be obtained just as readily by the side of a Plighland loch as in the cafes of the Strand or Regent-street. Well, vvell, As we, in the happy-go-lucky style of our peregrinations, find ourselves just a little out of our way, we shall go one step further and visit Oban before we get back to Loch Etive, and on to Glen coe. Our stay at this place will not be a long one. Oban is not a very old town, but it is avery flourishing one. A hundred years ago it was a wretched village, but there were great capabilities in the situation, and it only required the development of the surrounding country to develop these. About 1777 an enterprising family of the name of Ste venson fixed their abode here, and did much to make it a trading centre. The neighbouring proprietors wisely encou raged building, and when people began to appreciate the Highlands the fortunes of Oban caught the tide that, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Oban is built on the edge of a semicircular bay of the same name. There is a marine parade on the sea-shore, and behind this runs the principal thoroughfare, called George-street, from a little east of the railway station northward to the Dunolly Gate, from which the roads to Dunolly and Dunstaffnage Castles break off. The heights above the town are covered with charming villas, behind which, again, there is a succession of wooded slopes, beautiful in themselves, and commanding a fine sea view. If Oban is not a city of palaces, it is at least a city of hotels. They are large, \" replete with every comfort,\" as the advertisements respect ing- them quite truthfully assure you, and attended by hosts of waiters, who are all that waiters should be; and how much that is perhaps only those sorely tried functionaries know; but (alas! no human thing is perfect) they are terribly expensive. Not by the green banks of"], [511, "LOCH ETIVE. 487 toil lie now before him, and he begins to brace himself for work again. It is not a place either to work or holiday in, but if you catch the spirit that animates it, rather to run all day in a distracted and meaningless manner betw:een the steamer and the train, and the train and the steamer. Life here is like an idiot's tale, it is \" full of sound and fury,\" and unless you arc yourself a traveller, it \" signifies nothing.\" It has neither the full, even flow of the 'London street, in which there is much that is grand and majestic, if you only have eyes to see it; nor has it the peaceful silence of an ordinary village, or even the steady jog-trot of a town of the same size elsewhere. Some aver that out of the season, when the hotels are as vacant as the halls of Selma, and the population are idle, and the weather unsettled, ah, then, then is the time to live at Oban. This is as much as to say that Oban is at its best when the High lands are at their worst, which may be, but then Oban exists for and by means of the Highlands, and it is but a poor compliment to pay to it to say that it is at its best when it is not fulfilling the end of its being ! we suppose, as we have already, we think, remarked, that the hotel-keeper must make hay whilst the sun shines, that he must \"welcome the coming, speed the parting guest,\" and charge him vvell ; in short, that he must shear the Cockney lamb of his golden fleece whenever he gets the chance, or he will make no headway in his calling. Enough of him and of his w7ays. If one is not prepared to pay well, one must not expect to travel comfortably in the High lands ! Apart from all such considerations, we confess that, although we admire the appearance and the bustling life of Oban, we do not think it a desirable place to live in. It is a spot to make one a believer in the truth ofthe ancient doctrine that all things are in a perpetual flux. It is neither one thing nor another ; neither London nor the Highlands; neither town nor country. The man setting out on his travels does not feel that he has shaken the dust of his every-day existence off his feet till he is out of its borders.

It is remarkable for its scenery ; it is, perhaps, still more remarkable as the theatre of one of those bloody tragedies which disfigure thepage of Scottish history. The glen is not a very long one \u2014 less, indeed, than ten miles in extent, but the scenery is of a pe culiar as well as a striking character. In most of the Highland glens there is a certain order, method, and regularity observable. The processes of Nature have been slow and gradual, and the peaks and precipices stand out clear, distinct, and well-defined. In Glencoe, on the other hand, there is a sort of wild chaos. Mountains and rocks of stupen dous size are heaped confusedly together in vast masses. Through this, in process. of time, the stream has cut a bed for itself, and by this there is a narrow strip of ground. This \" vast, capacious, and lengthened gully\" is never very broad, and is often so narrow as to be rarely, if ever, visited by the full light of the sun, for the hills rise on either side tothe height of two thousand feet. A striking feature of the glen is the very large number of streams which fall rather than rush from the rocks. Many of the hills hang over the road, and the tra veller may be excused if he feels a certain dread lest they should fall and crush the daring mortal who has protruded into their territory. There is a small lake in the valley called Treatchan, and from this the Coe or Cona issues. The lake is small, but deep and sullen. Its waters, stained by the soil through which they have previously run, take a still and are once more in the valley of Loch Etive. This land of rainbows, spanning glens whose walls. Rock-built, are hung with rainbow- coloured mists Of far stretched meres, whose salt flood never rests, Of tuneful caves and playing water- falls, Of mountains varying momently their crests. At the head of Loch Etive is the mouth of the Etive water, which runs from Kingshouse to the Loch, a distance of about sixteen miles. It is, like most of the streams about here, a fine salmon river. As to the scenery, Mr. Hamerton says of it: \u2014 \"It is, in my opinion, one of the very grandest Highland glens I have ever seen. That noble granite stream, the Etive, is to me full of interest, for it abounds in admirable pictures. I have never seen finer water-sculpture any where than on the rose-coloured rocks of the Etive, nor more picturesque Scotch firs than those which in some places shade it with their dark foliage. There are terribly black pools too, one especially where the deep water winds in a narrow channel that a stag would leap over, between two precipitous banks of massive granite. The mountain scenery is throughout magnificent, and grandly terminated, when you reach Loch Etive, by a far distant view of Ben Cruachan. There is a noble domed tower of rock seven or eight miles from Kingshouse, which is a tower and not a buttress ; and a few miles nearer the sea the outlines, as you look up the glen, have a wonderful vigour"], [513, "GLENCOE AND ITS MEMORIES. 489 deeper shade from the surrounding sha dows. Not the least of the effects of this gloomy spot is produced by the almost total absence of signs of human habitation. A solitary farm-house or two may in deed be seen, but that is all. The road through it is not a frequented one, and the traveller is left, through many ofthe miles of the rugged way, to the com panionship of his thoughts, which are likely to reflect the melancholy character of the scenery, and the still sadder character of the historical memories which must be present to the mind of every one who treads Glencoe. tear will be on his cheek Then come thou, O Malvina, with all thy music come ; lay Ossian in the plain of Lutha, let his tomb rise in ths lonely field.\" And yet again, \" Why bends the bard of Cona over his secret strea n ? Is this a time for sorrow, father as low-laid Oscar ? \" But it is not on account of its scenery, nor on account of the songs of Ossian, that Glencoe is most famous. When we think of this lonely glen, we may think, indeed, of those things, but first of all we remember the massacre of Glencoe. Like so many other remark able events, it got but scant notice at the time; it gradually grew into public notice, and is more famous or infamous in the nineteenth century than it was in the century in which it occurred. Macaulay has noted this point almost as if it took away some of the special atrocity which future times have believed to be attached to this business ; but it must be judged by considerations wider than those of a particular age. The unprejudiced ver dict of mankind is the only one that can determine such an issue, and it has de termined to rank the massacre of Glen coe with the blackest deeds in British history. It is this method of judging events by the standard of the time when they happened that has produced many ofthe curious results at which some of our great modern historians have ar rived. It is the method pursued, for instance, by Mr. Froule in his vindica tion of the character of Henry the Eighth, and it is a method which has a good deal to be said for it. It would be grossly unfair to judge a savage by the same tests as those we apply to the inhabitants of a highly-civilised country; and when we are discussing the actions of men in another age, we must allow something for the manners of that age. But, again, the judgment of con temporaries is often erroneous, forseveral reasons. They very rarely have all the facts before them, and when they Glencoe is, of course, the glen of the Coe, and the Coe is the Cona, with which all those who read Ossian are familiar. Here he vvas born, and this stream he refers to again and again in those sounding passages of his in which, genuine or not, competent critics have recognised the very sound of the stream over its rocky bed, and the rush of the wind down the glen. Here are a few of them from his various poems \u2014 Fin- gal, Carthon, the Song of Selma, etc. :\u25a0 \u2014 \"Their sound was like a thousand streams that meet in Cona's vale, when, after a stormy night, they turn their dark eddies beneath the pale light of morning.\" Again, \" The gloomy ranks of Lochlin fell, like the boom of the roaring Cona. If he overcome, I will rush in my strength like the roaring stream of Cona.\" Again, \"Sleeps the sweet voice of Cona in the midst of his rustling hall? Sleeps Ossian in his hall and his friends without their fame?\" Ao-ain, \"The chiefs gathered from all their hills and heard the lovely sound. They praised the voice of Cona, the first among a thousand bards, but age is now on my tongue, and my soul has failed.\" A\u00b0-ain, \"So shall they search in vain for the voice of Cona after it has failed in the field. The hunter shall come forth in the morning, and the voice of my harp shall not be heard.\" \"Where is the son of car-borne Fingal ?

Besides its judgment is never a mob judgment, because the mob do not read history deeply, far less write it. With these re flections, which may serve as a preface to our account of sevqral events in Scot tish history, besides this, we proceed to give a description of the Glencoe mas sacre, following generally Mr. Burton's account of the matter. Secretary of State for Scotland, vvas much disappointed when he found that the chiefs had submitted. He seems to have thought that this would be a favourable opportunity for rooting out some of them, and now it was likely that all would escape. He then learned that Macdonald of Glencoe, a chief of a small clan, or division of a clan, and a man who had served with distinction under Dundee, and who was besides a Papist and an individual who had troubled his Lowland neighbours a good deal by his raids upon them, had not submitted. This was the very oppor tunity for which he had been desirous, and he was about to set the machinery of the law into force when he dis covered, to his chagrin, that the informa tion had been wrong, and that Mac donald had sworn ; but then again he learned that there had been a flaw in the proceedings. It had been caused thus. The Macdonalds of Glencoe, there seems to be no doubt, lived by plunder. In deed, situated as they were, they had no other means of support. The account we have given of the glen sufficiently explains this. Its solitariness and gran deur are alike connected with its sterility. Its grandeur is akin to that of the ocean and the desert. At the present day it can scarcely support a couple of families, and it could just as little do so then. Its very wildness, perhaps, vvas an in ducement to a body of Highland free booters to inhabit it, for there they were likely to be safe, and, in fact, they had been safe up till now. The more fertile parts of what we call the county of Argyle were their favourite hunting grounds. There vvas thus bitter hostility between them and the Campbells, and no doubt the chief of the Campbells, con nected as he and his clan were with the revolution, and possessing an hereditary jurisdiction, which made him absolutely supreme within his own territories, vvas identified by them with the government. Hence, then, the chief of the Macdonalds When the revolution of 16S8 vvas accomplished, it vvas seen that the Highlands \u2014 the very place where it had been longest resisted, and where, indeed, the only real stand for King James had been made in Great Britain \u2014 was the very place whence the first attempt to overthrow it would come. The risings of the '15 and the '45 amply justified this fear. It was determined to attempt to bring over the chiefs to the side of the government, so a sum of about \u00a320,000 vvas placed in the Earl of Breadalbane' s hands, to be by him expended in this work. The sum for the time and the country was enormous, and the bait was, after a little toying with it, eagerly swallowed. The chiefs came flocking in to swear the oath to the new government \u2014 an oath to which it is scarcely conceivable that any of them attached much impor tance \u2014 and receive their share of the spoil. Tne time fixed vvas the ist January, 1692, and, as vvas natural, those who had not sworn by that time were threatened with the extreme vengeance of the law \u2014 with letters of \" fire and sword \" in short, such as we have seen were issued against the Macgregors. It would appear that Sir John Dalrymple,"], [515, "GLENCOE AND LTS MEMORIES. 491 did not think, at first, of taking the oath till he saw that all the other chieftains were doing so, and that he would soon be left alone. It then must have oc curred to him that this would give his foes the very opportunity which they desired, and that they would thus have a very plausible pretext for obtaining and turning against him and his people the full vengeance of the law. The more he reflected on this, the more he vvas convinced of the mistake he was making, and at last, when it vvas almost too late, he determined to submit like the rest. He unfortunately set out for the wrong place. Instead of going to the Sheriff of Argyle at Inverary \u2014 a journey which would have been a com paratively easy one \u2014 -he set out for Fort William, and presented himself to Colonel Hill, the commanding officer at that fort, as ready to make the sub mission required by law. It vvas then he vvas told that he must go to Inverary after all. The commandant had nothing to do with the matter, but he was so convinced of Macdonald's eagerness, that he furnished him with a letter to the Sheriff, urging him to receive the oath, though the bearer should arrive a little late. All this impressed Mac <lonald still more with the seriousness of the business. He set off for Inverary as fast as ever he could. The reader will understand, from what we have said of the scenery of these parts, how difficult such a journey must have been in the height of winter, over the rough tracks that served for roads at that period. Yet the journey was made, and that with ex traordinary speed. Though the return route brought him within the vicinity of his own house \u2014 his son says within half a-mile \u2014 yet he went on without stopping. When he came to Inverary he found that his haste had been in vain. The day vvas already past, and the Sheriff was away from home. There was nothing to be done but to wait till he returned. When he did so he was at first inclined to refuse the oath, which he vvas legally entitled to do, but the return had not yet been made, there was a plausible and indeed sufficient reason for the delay, and the government might be supposed anxious to receive a sub mission so much in accordance with their desires, even if it came somewhat late, so that the Sheriff received the oath, and Macdonald, with a mind immensely relieved, returned to Glencoe, thinking that everything was now right. When the returns were transmitted to Edin burgh there w7as some discussion as to what should be done; finally those who had the management of the business deter mined that advantage should be taken of the flaw in the proceedings, that these therefore should be annulled, and that the settlement in Glencoe should be rooted out. The plan was of itself fiendish in con ception, but the mode in which it vvas to be carried out was, if possible, still worse, The soldiers of the regular army would never have been cruel enough to do the work properly, so the Campbells, the bitter foes of the Mac donalds, were employed in the congenial task. The leader vvas Campbell of Glenlyon, who vvas connected by mar riage with the chief of Glencoe, and therefore likely to be looked on with less suspicion. The attack vvas to be made with the utmost possible secrecy and despatch, and in the coldest of weather, so that as few of the hated sept as possible could escape, and there were also sig'nisicant remarks made about \"not troubling the government with prisoners,\" \" seeing that the old fox and his cubs did not escape,\" \"preventing flight to the mountains,\" and so on ; finally, and worst of all, the whole business vvas to be a deliberately planned act of treachery. <* It was necessary that if the matter vvas to be kept secret, it should above all things, be quickly carried through, and certainly no time vvas lost. R\u00bb"], [516, "492 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. Macdonald swore the oath on the 6th January, 1692, and on the 14th February, little more than a month after, the massacre took place. It vvas in the first thought it no time to make nice dis tinctions, and he likewise was put to death. There were about 200 men capable days of February when the party reached the glen. When the Macdonalds sent to inquire their intention, they said of bearing arms in the valley, and it had been intended to make an end of all these; but the plan had not been completely laid. The detachments failed \" they were part of a regiment which the Duke of Argyle had raised among his friends and clan, and sent to quarter there because the new fortress at Fort William could not accommodate them.\" They were received with the utmost cordiality. No doubt the Macdonalds supposed themselves to be reconciled to the powers that ruled in Scotland. The arrival of the strangers produced a pleasing change in the monotony of life in that savage spot ; they were feasted by the whole population, and, as was natural, special attention in the chief's house vvas paid to the officers. The very night before the massacre vvas spent by Campbell and some of his friends in a game at cards, at the house of one of the victims. All vvas not perfectly smooth, however. Some change in the disposition of the soldiers, some mutterings that had been heard, pro- bably something in the manner and looks of the guests, for we cannot be- lieve that they were such accomplished hypocrites as to play their part ab- solutely to the life, aroused the suspicions of the two sons of the chief, and they communicated these suspicions to their father, who seems to have considered them as absolutely unfounded. Early on the following morning he was roused from his bed by an unexpected visit from his guests. As he was hastily dressing to receive them, they burst into his room, attacked and killed him in presence of his wife, who vvas cruelly treated and died the next day. The Laird of Achtrichatain was at this time on a visit to Glencoe. He had sworn the oath long before the last day ap pointed, and had with him the govern ment certificate, but the Campbells ! to surround the houses effectually, and j to block up the modes of escape from the j pass, so that as many as one hundred and sixty of the two hundred escaped. The women and children \" were turned out naked at the dead of night, a keen. freezing night, into a waste covered with snow at the distance of six long miles from any inhabited place.\" The two sons ofthe chief were among those who escaped. Campbell had seen the alarm of one of them, and had taken some pains to quiet his fears. How, he said, could he sus- pect anything from a kinsman ? But the young man vvas uneasy and sus- picious. When the attack was begun he at once saw that his worst fears were about to be realised; he fled instantly, and so escaped. His brother was roused by a faithful clansman, who passionately called to him, \" Is it a time to be sleep- ing when they are killing your brother at the door? \" He too at once saw how things were, and likewise fled in the same hasty fashion as had been adopted by his brother. ., The affair was seen to be a huge mis take when the facts were realised. As vvas said of another event, it was not only a crime but a blunder; it vvas a scandal to the people of England, accustomed for centuries to the regular administra tion of justice, and who, when they suffered injustice, at least only suffered it by regular process of law. It was seized by the Jacobites abroad, as well it might be, and made the most of as the deed of a government whose only raison d'etre vvas that it had overthrown the illegal and unconstitutional rule of the second James. For these and other reasons, among which surely the feeling"], [517, "SOME THLNGS WORTH A WORD IN ARGYLE. 493 of outraged humanity had, even in sav age Scotland, something to do, the matter created a very great deal of dis cussion at the time, and yet all that vvas ever done vvas to censure Sir John Dal rymple and the Earl of Breadalbane, and even this censure did not proceed from the central government, but vvas contained in a memorial ofthe Estates to the king, of date 15th July, 1695. This was the work of the political opponents of these statesmen ; still, it is difficult to see why King William did not pay more attention to it. It is possible to clear his memory from the charge of having consented to the original plan ; but he was, at least, an accessory after the fact. The remainder of the clan were still treated as half criminals; they were suf fered, indeed, to return to Glencoe, but with a fine irony were required to find caution for their future good behaviour. It would seem that after this they were no longer able to pursue their former modes of life, \u2014 it cannot be denied that, so far, the massacre was successful; though other measures equally success ful, and less infamous, might have been taken. The remnant gradually de creased. Either the men went to other parts of the country, or, as is the case with some races that Nature has doomed, they gradually died out, and Glencoe became the solitary spot that it now is, and is likely to remain. Some Things Worth a Word in Argyle. T sometimes hap- pens to us in the course of our pere- grinations that in , moving here and there through a county or district, belong to the same category as the mermaid and the sea-serpent \u2014 some thing dangerous, and yet with a certain terrible beauty. It is here, from of old, that the sirens have taken up their abode, and in dulcet strains wooed the mariner to his own destruction. The mermaids and sirens have long departed even from the imagination of the vulgar and though whirlpools do still remain, yet they are shorn of their former glory, and are but the ghosts of their former selves. Who ever reads about the famous Lurlei rock and its eddy on the Rhine, without being told that it is hardly dangerous even to small craft, whilst vessels of any size may despise it ? As for Scylla and Charybdis, we now know that all about them is a mere fable, whilst the great maelstrom off the coast of Scandinavia, and of which those who have read Poe's deliciously horrible story in the well known \" Tales of Mystery,\" must have such a vivid re- we come upon some things worth a word or two, and yet such as we cannot give a whole article to describe. Without much regard to the conditions of space and time, we are forced to lump these together into one article, and to pass, by swift and unex pected transitions, from one to the other. This is what we are doing here; and first, then, as to the Scylla and Charybdis of this northern sphere \u2014 Ardnamurchan Point and Corryvechan. The world somehow has a great interest in whirl pools. There seems something in the dangerous swirl and wash of the wave that fascinates the imagination. They"], [518, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 494 collection, is now confessed to be greatly exaggerated, and our own Corryvechan has been also unduly minished of his glories. We say unduly because in the description of it we are told that it is not dangerous except in certain states of the weather. But surely in judging whirlpools it is only fair to take them at their best (or perhaps worst, for such is the best of a whirlpool !) It may be true, as McCulloch remarks, that \" this pas sage is seldom used by boats, and never by vessels; it has received, in addition to the exaggeration, the further ill cha racter that attends all untried dangers. Had it been as necessary a channel as the Kyle Rock or Hoy Mouth, we should have heard far less of its horrors. Like those ofthe maelstrom, they shrink before the boldness of a fair examina tion,\" and yet there may be, and is, we maintain, something in Corryvechan after all. At any rate, since it is the only decently-sized whirlpool in Britain, let us make the most of it we can. the paucity of accidents is tobe accounted for. On one occasion a foreign vessel strayed into the gulf, and wras caught in the whirlpool. She vvas turned about like a feather, and her crew were so terrified that they were quite unable to do anything ; fortunately she got into some side eddy which took her out of the most dangerous part, and whirled her swiftly along the Jura shore, till the crew took courage and proceeded to recover command of her again. Those who listen to \" Corryvechan's roar\" may rest assured that it can bite as well as bark. But why is it called by this high sounding name ? We trust the reader will be glad to know that there is a story connected with it. In a dis tant age there dwelt in Scandinavia a gallant young prince, \"dark and true, and tender,\" as a northern fairy prince ought to be. As he increased in years and became a man, he got restless, and wished to go on his travels and see the world. So off he set in a beaked galley with a band of gallant followers, and had many wonderful adventures, which may be read in their proper place. Now in the course of his travels he came to the Western Islands, where the Lords of the Isles ruled, and was entertained right royally at their court. Now the then Lord ofthe Isles had a daughter of surpassing beauty, and with this fair Princess of Thule the Prince fell des perately in love. She returned his passion with equal ardour; but as they were a proper and well-behaved couple, they confessed their affection to the old Lord, and asked his consent to their union. But this the old gentleman was unwilling to give, for he had already pro mised her to somebody else, and he was afraid that his territory of the isles would be quite swallowed up in the great kingdom of Scandinavia, and the prospect did not please him, so he would have liked to have sent the Prince about his business, but this he dared not do, Between Scraba and Jura there is a passage a mile in length and very nar row; through this the tide flows into the Sound of Jura. The average depth is about a hundred fathoms, so that there is a great body of water in the narrow passage. A great rock springs from the bottom in the middle of the passage, and rises nearly to the top. Thus the tidal flow is interrupted and bent round in a particular direction, and another current flowing from the Scraba shore adds to the force of this, and gives the whole a swinging, whirlpool motion. Sometimes the wind is opposed to the swell and tide : then the whole gulf is one seething mass of waters produced by currents which, being caused by oppo site forces, run in different directions, and meet and break against each other with frightful violence. The inhabitants of the district do not at all underrate the dangers of such a gulf; they carefully refrain from using it except at such times as it is perfectly safe, and thus"], [519, "SOME THINGS WORTH A WORD IN ARGYLE. 495 for the Prince he knew could collect a sufficient body of fighting men to make an end at once of his puny rule, and besides he thought it impolitic to offend the Prince's father. So he put off a little to gain time, but the Prince vvas young and impetuous, and would brook no delay. So at last he said he would consent on one condition, to which the young man agreed before he knew what it vvas, and then the wily old monarch told him that just to show his love, he must anchor his bark for three days and three nights in the whirlpool, which as yet had no name. Both the Prince and Princess were very much discouraged at this, and they thought it would have been much better if at first they had got into the beaked galley and sailed away without taking the trouble of asking permission ; but the Prince vvas determined not to break his promise. So at last he remembered a very vvise man in his old kingdom, and with many tears and vows the lovers took leave of one another, and he set off for his far northern home to consult the wise man as to what was best to be done. He accomplished his journey in safety, and on his arrival took counsel of the seer. He told him that the thing was difficult but not impossible. against all question by offering her hair, and some of it was unfortunately taken. The Prince had now got what he wanted, so he set off again to the Isles. Pie at once proceeded to put his plan into exe cution. He fearlessly rowed his skiff to the whirlpool, ami anchored right in the middle of the gulf. The first day the water was unusually quiet, though there was one big swell during which the hempen rope broke short. The second day it vvas a little wilder, and the woollen cable broke. The third dav there vvas such a storm as had never been seen before. The waves dashed against each other, and eddied madly round, and foamed against the rocks as if they had been incarnate fiends, and the wind howled and roared as if it had been a wild beast, and the rain poured down from the skies as if it too wished to take its share in the destruction of the unhappy bark. With anxious eyes the Princess watched from the shore. Still the bark held fast by its charmed cable till the storm gathered itself, as if for one gigantic effort, and wind and sea rushed together on the vessel. So dark vvas it that the Princess could see nothing for a few moments, but it seemed to her that even in the midst of the howling of the storm she heard a wild shriek as if some human being was in the extreme agony of the death-struggle. And then the wind fell, and the evening sun. emerging from behind a cloud, poure.l forth its rays on the troubled waters \u2014 but the bark was gone! the faithless cable had parted in the hour of trial, and the gulf had swallowed up both the Prince and his vessel. Another being beside the Princess had watched throughout the three days, with as de voted, if not as intelligent a care. This was the favourite dog of Brechan \u2014 so they called the unfortunate lover \u2014 and now, when the lady vvas borne sense less home, it still remained on the watch, and when the sea vvas calm again, it swam, in and brought forth the body He must provide himself with three strong ropes, one to be of hemp, one of wool, and one of woman's hair.

On the shore of Jura, overlooking the whirlpool, is a little cairn where lie the remains of Brechan, with his faithful dog resting at his feet, and after him the gulf gets its name, which,* being a little changed, is the Corryvechan as we now know it. through the porous rock, though it was believed that the basin had been filled by supernatural powers. The traditions of Ardnamurchan are very numerous. Most of them relate to some deed of violence, and its violent ex piation. One may bethought worth the telling. It is curious, even ludicrous, and grossly improbable. The district here vvas once possessed by a Norwegian prince, who rejoiced in the euphonious appellation of Muchdragon Mac Ri Lochlunn. He vvas a licentious rascal, and was accustomed to make love to all the pretty women in his dominions, married or unmarried. His vassals accordingly regarded the visits of this Lord with considerable suspicion. One Evan Cleiveach vvas possessed of a very pretty wife, and when he heard of Muchdragon's approaching visit, he was in despair. He, however, fell on what the chronicler terms \" a singularly bold and ingenious expedient.\" He armed himself with his \" Tughairm, \" or battle axe, and clothed himself in a long robe composed of parts very loosely sewn to gether. He went out to meet the chief, who vvas advancing, attended by a re tinue, and watching a favourable oppor tunity when the other was off his guard, he killed him with one blow of the axe. Of course he was hotly pursued, but when the fleetest of foot reached the flying Evan and laid hold of the skirts of his mantle, and tugged lustily at it in order to stop him, the piece gave way, and he fell headlong down the hill side. The same thing happened to the second and third pursuer. Evan escaped to the place where he had con cealed a boat, in which his wife and family were already embarked. With them he set sail for Islay, where he was out of reach of hostile pursuit. The chief spots of this remarkable history are still commemorated by the special name of \" Muchdragon's Cairn,\" where that individual vvas buried, and so on. Ardnamurchan Point, as the most west erly point of the mainland of Britain, may well be thought deserving of a passing word. A line drawn from it forms a sort of division line between the Western Isles, which are called Northern or Southern, according as they lie in re lation to it. It is a wild headland, con sisting of a mass of naked rock, against which the waves dash with fearful ve hemence. It has been the scene of many shipwrecks. Such bodies as are from time to time recovered from the sea are buried in a graveyard in a little creek on the furthest part of the headland. The dash of the waves, even in the calmest weather, is always heard by those who stand here, and it seems to form a fitting dirge for the departed. Ardnamurchan forms a parish, which Loch Sunart on one side, and Loch Shiel on the other, make a peninsula. Its name is said to mean the promontory or height ofthe great seas, and, indeed, the name may be applied not only to the point, but to the whole district, which is a mass of tangled rock and torrent, with a good deal of mountain, wood, and a profusion of lochs and caves. A curious superstition is connected with one of these last near the headland. There is a sort of natural basin formed in the rock, and this \u2014 which vvas always found filled with water \u2014 vvas drunk dry by sick people as a sovereign cure for troubles of all kinds. \"A few years ago,\" says a narrator, referring, how ever, to a period at least half a century ago, \" some pins, needles, metal buttons, and an old halfpenny, might be seen there, the last tribute to expiring super stition.\" The real reason ofthe wonder ful supply of water vvas that it filtered Leaving Ardnamurchan, we next"], [521, "SO.

Morvern, or Morven, has a sort of poetical significance, for just as Lowland song is connected with Yarrow vale and river, so these hills are connected with Gaelic poetry, so often are they mentioned and sung in it, \"As a hundred winds on Morven, as the streams of a hundred hills been. Things were settled in a rough and-ready fashion then, for there was no such things as damages for breach of promise to marry, nor vvas there a divorce court. Many scandals and con tinual quarrels and violence were the consequence, and the saints were much exercised as to how to put a stop to it all. The plans they adopted were different, yet both pointed to the same end. Fingal rushed on in his strength, ter rible as the spirit of Tremnor, when in a whirlwind he comes to Morven to see the children of his pride,\" and so on unceasingly. Morven probably meant a much wider district than this Argyleshire parish ; but this may be taken as representing it. The scenery of this parish is rather uninteresting \u2014 at least when compared with that of some of the adjacent parts of the county. There are several old castles in it \u2014 Argyle is indeed, specially rich in such. Chief of these in Morven is the Castle of Arintosh. Couslan gave support to the old pagan custom, which we have already come across in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Near the church there was a pillar with a hole in it through which sweethearts were accustomed to join hands as a sign of betrothal, Couslan added the sanction of the Church to this, and denounced the wrath of Heaven against those who were proved faithless to this simple engagement. Cowin's plan was very different. It had at least the merit of boldness and ingenuity. On a given day every year, all married people who were discontented with their partners assembled in the church. They were then blindfolded, and made to run round the building as fast as they could. When they re-assembled, the priest pronounced the word cabhag, which, it seems, signifies \"seize quickly,\" whereupon each man laid hold of the first woman he touched, and she became his wife for a year; at the expiration of which time he could try his luck again if so disposed. The discontented found that they had jumped from the frying pan into the fire, and determined in future to bear the ills, or rather wives, they had, rather than fly to others they knew not of. The attendance at the annual meeting, at first numerous, gradu ally fell off, and at last ceased alto gether, and this vvas just as the saint intended ; and if he had not been a saint, we might even have supposed that he indulged in a quiet chuckle over the success of his plan. Of the districts of Argyle we haveas yet said nothing. We shall here only note the most prominent \u2014 Cantire, that long peninsula which runs out so far into the North Channel as to be within thirteen miles of Ireland. It is about forty miles long, and from five to twelve miles broad. A chain of hills of a moderate elevation runs through it. Near the southern extremity is Campbeltown, a thriving fishing station, It is justly cele brated at the present day for its whisky, which is manufactured here on a great scale. In a distant age it possessed a less dubious honour, as it vvas then re nowned for its saints. Of two of these, Couslan and Covvin. history makes hon ourable mention. In those days the in habitants of Campbeltown, which then had another name, were, in one respect, a specially perverse generation.

It recalls both the house of Argyle and their ancient seat, and, after having said a word on Inverary, we shall speak of that noble family with whose name there is bound up so many great and glorious, and, alas, some cruel and treacherous deeds. we ask how old, we at once come upon a difficulty. To arrive at the real original source here is as difficult as to get at the source of the Nile. Notwith standing the violence of Scottish history, there is no great and decisive break in it, such, for instance, as vvas the case in England, where the Saxon invasion and the Norman Conquest twice gave dis tinct changes of development to the annals of the country. It is this which makes the fiction of the hundred kings, if not more plausible, at least less ridi culous than the early fabulous history of England ; and this also gives free scope to the family historian of the North, who, losing himself in the mists of the early centuries of our era, can there imagine at his own sweet will, whereas your genealogist in England is pulled up at the Norman Conquest. Inverary is not by any means so ancient as the family that possess it. The Campbells did not remove here till the beginning of the fourteenth century, and the place was only constituted a burgh in 1648. The charter was signed by Charles I, at Carisbrook Castle, in the Isle of Wight. The inhabitants, for the most part, support themselves by the herring fishing, which is vigorously prosecuted in the waters of Loch Fyne. Near the town is Inverary Castle, the seat of the duke. It is described in Black's Guide-Book as a \" massive quad rangular building, constructed of chlorite slate, and consists of two stories and a sunk floor, flanked with round over lapping towers, and surmounted in the centre by a square-winged pavilion, which, through its Gothic-shaped case ments, admits light to the interior. As restored, after being partially destroyed by fire in 1877, the castle has, instead of the original battlements with flat or platform roof, a sloping roof with dormer windows.\" It was built in 1 744-1 761, and succeeded to an earlier and ruder structure erected by the first Earl of Argyle about 14S0. Near here formerly stood the wretched huts that constituted the old town of Inverary. These were destroyed to make way for the new erection, and the town vvas replanted on its present site. About the year a.d. 404, the lordship of Argyle vvas possessed by the great and powerful family of O'Duin. They had, it was believed, come from Ireland some centuries before. Now one of these. Diarmid O'Duin, lived about the time of Ossian- \u2014 when that was does not clearly appear, but no doubt these eminent persons, who inhabited the same district, were intimate with one another. Diarmid was chiefly remarkable for the wonderful shape of his mouth, which was \" clean cam,\" in so far as it vvas very crooked. Cam, then, means crooked, and beul a mouth, and thus we have Campbell. The worst of this explanation is, that, althoughoneindividual might be crooked mouthed, yet all his descendants could hardly be, and it seems rather a violent proceeding to give up your family name and adopt another one, simply to com memorate an unpleasing physical pecu liarity in one of your ancestors ! The more general story is that the name is Campobello, meaning in low Latin the fairfield (Beauchamp), and that the name is Norman. One of the knights of this Campobello family married, in the eleventh century, Eva, heiress and To say that the Campbells are a very old family, is to utter a truism ; but when"], [524, "PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. 500 daughter of Paul O'Duin, of Lochovv. His son vvas Sir Colin Campbell, the first knight. He was knighted by Alex ander III., in 12S0, and was the first known by the name of \"the Mac Callum More,\" though there is considerable doubt as to what that really means. As \" more \" undoubtedly means great (Malcolm Canmore \u2014 Malcolm with the big head), it has been supposed to sig-nify the great son of Callum, though there is no mention of the name Callum in any of the records of the family. Some think that Mac Callum ought to be Mac Allan or Alaine, and this is the Romance word for stranger ; and if we take Mac to mean magnus or great (it certainly did not always mean son), Mac Callum More reads the great stranger chief. However, to return to Sir Colin. This gentleman supported Bruce, but got involved with Bruce's opponent, the Lord of Lome, and was killed in a fight with that chief, and succeeded by Sir Neil Campbell, who, with the fidelity so characteristic of the race, stuck to the fortunes of Bruce through good report and bad report, and finally assisted in the crowning victory of Bannockbum. Of Sir Colin Campbell the third, Sir Archibald Campbell the fourth, and Sir Colin Campbell the fifth knight, there is no need for saying anything, save that in all the good and bad fortunes of the royal family they were loyal to the backbone ; and as the royal house always got its own again, they found that honesty here, as elsewhere, vvas the best policy. Sir Duncan Campbell, the sixth knight, vvas the first who vvas raised to the peerage. His third son vvas the famous Duncan Campbell, ancestor of the Breadalbane line. \" Throch his valiant actis and manhud,\" says the family history, \"he was maid knicght in the Isle of Rhodes, quhilk standeth in the Carpathian Sea, near to Caria, and country of Asia the less, and he vvas three sundrie tymes in Rome.\" He was the Knight of Rhodes of whom we have already spoken, and related how his lady occupied herself during his travels in building part of his castle. There is a story relating to his home-coming which seems worth the telling. He vvas supposed to be dead ; at least, no intelli gence of him had reached the castle, the fact being that all the letters were inter cepted by a certain Baron McCroquo dale, who vvas enamoured in some degree ofthe supposititious widow, and in a much greater degree ot her lands. His attentions were extremely pressing, and perhaps in the end the lady mig-ht have yielded, when suddenly Sir Colin appeared on the scene. He, in the dis tant East, had been troubled with a suc cession of dreams, and as the interpreta tion of these by a friar skilled in such matters by no means reassured him, he at once started for his far-off home. As he surmised that plots were laid for his life, he approached the castle in the dis guise of a beggar. It vvas a feast, and the beggar vvas received with true High land hospitality. He ate sparingly but drank not at all. The jovial nobles pressed him, but he would not, he said, unless the lady of the house herself filled the goblet for him. She did so; he drained it at a draught, and as he handed her back the empty cup, she saw sparkling at the bottom the ring which she had given him when he had bound the cross on his arm, and departed for the Holy City. She looked up, recognised her husband, and fell with a cry into his arms. We may well believe the McCroquodale was sent about his business, and the Knight of Rhodes enjoyed his own again. Returning to the direct line, we next come to Colin, Lord Campbell, first Earl of Argyle. He married Isabella Stewart, daughter and heiress of the Lord of Lome and Innermeath.

One cannot help noting in this connection the thorough-going character of clan loyalty. The men were equally ready to abduct heiresses and listen attentively to sermons at the command of Mac Callum More. It was owing to this addition that \"the Lome galley, with sails furled, oars in action, and flag and pennant flying,\" was added to the family coat-of-arms. The son and successor of this nobleman died at Flodden in the very thickest of the fight, and was succeeded by Colin, his eldest son. The third son, Sir John, vvas married to the heiress of Calder, whose name was Muriel. The Earl of Argyle was her guardian, and when she was but yet a baby he despatched one of his dependent Campbells to bring her to Inverary, that she might be safely brought up there, and married to one of his sons \u2014 for the astute nobleman had no intention of letting such a prize slip through his grasp. But her uncles had other views for her, and kept her care fully guarded. Campbell, aware of the difficulty of the task that lay before him, proceeded to Cawdor with his seven sons, and there vvas successful in capturing the child, whilst she was out with her nurse. The uncles were away from home, but when they returned they col lected a force and marched off in des perate haste, and were soon in a fair way to regain possession of the little n-irl. They were baffled by a most in genious device. Old Campbell ordered his sons to surround a large camp kettle turned bottom upward, and to defend it with their lives ! Seldom has human blood been spilt in so apparently unromantic a cause, The pursuers came up, and when they saw the vast pot, they believed that it contained the object of their search, thus safely stowed out of harm's way\u2014 the pot vvas inverted, and it was possible that a child might be concealed under it\u2014 so they at once at tacked the seven champions, and after a hard struggle killed them all. They then turned up the pot and found nothing ! Muriel was far away, and out Archibald, the fifth Earl, vvas an at tached Protestant ; but he vvas, strange to say, an attached loyalist too, and was present at the Battle of Langside, on the side of the unfortunate Mary. He after wards used what influence he had in England to mitigate the rigours of her imprisonment. Passing by the sixth, we come to Archibald, the seventh Earl. He vvas greatly in favour at court till he married a second time, when he curiously deserted the traditions of his family. His wife was a violent Romanist, and she succeeded in converting him. For long the secret vvas kept; but at last the suspicious and timid king heard"], [526, "502 PICTURESQUE SCOTLAND. some rumours which gave him a fright, and the Earl vvas summoned to appear at Edinburgh, against a certain day. He did not do so, and vvas put under sentence of outlawry, which lasted two years.

He escaped and fled to Holland, but took part in Mon- mouth's premature rising \u2014 the Scottish invasion being intrusted to him. The attempt vvas a complete failure. Argyle w7as captured, and by the exclamation \"Unfortunate Argyle,\" at the moment of seizure, revealed his rank. He vvas hurried to Edinburgh, there to meet his doom. It vvas then thought proper to make bitter in every way the last hours of a man condemned to die. He vvas led through the streets to the castle of Edinburgh, his hands bound behind his back, whilst the public executioner walked before him. It was not considered necessary to make a new trial. The Earl vvas condemned on the last sentence. He met death with perfect courage. The incident commemorated in \"the last sleep of Argyle \" is well known. It was a curious custom then, it may be remarked, to execute the capital sentence at a somewhat advanced period of the day, and it vvas noted that Argyle died with all his accustomed calm. At the scaf- fold he embraced the instrument of execution, and in allusion to its popular name, said it was the sweetest maiden he had ever kissed ; then laid his head on the block, and in an instant all was over. We have often, as we passed near the place where these and so many other executions took place, paused to look around us. Some ofthe chief archi- tectural and natural surroundings are still the same. The crowned spire of St. Giles's rises immediately overhead; the old grey castle rock still towers in stern grandeur over the scene How often have these been the last objects \u2022 that doomed men have looked on. Strangely sad and solemn they must have appeared to dying eyes, for to us the very memory makes them look sad and solemn. The next two bearers of the title both died upon the scaffold, and yet there are no two brighter names on the long and illustrious roll of this great family. The first of these was Archibald, the eighth Earl. He vvas thoroughly representa tive of the Scotch nation, and that nation at this time had a most difficult part to play. It was devotedly attached to the representative of its long line of ancient kings; but it vvas still more strongly at tachedtothePresbyterian form of religion, which that king vvas doing his best to de stroy. Hence those continual and prob ably unavoidable changes in its policy at this period. Argyle steadily supported the Covenants, but he fought for the cause of the Stewarts, and indeed was the nobleman who placed the crown on the King's head at Scone. But he had incurred the King's displeasure by the long theological discussions in which he had forced him to engage, and the royalists were not inclined to discuss too minutely the difference between a Roundhead and a Presbyterian, so at the Restoration a charge of treason was trumped up against him, and he vvas found guilty and beheaded. His son had been only released from prison at the Restoration, for he had been a most devoted loyalist ; but he was now put in again, and tried and condemned to death as a traitor ! The Government did not go quite so far as to execute him ; but he vvas kept six years in captivity. He was now restored"], [527, "IN THE ISLAND OF SKYE. 503 All the honours of the family were forfeited by the condemnation of the Earl for treason, but his son attached himself to William Prince of Orange, and recovered all that had been lost and a great deal more when that prince ascended the English throne as William the Third He was the person who administered the coronation oath accord ing to the Scottish form to the new monarch, and he it was who in one auspicious day (23rd June, 1701) was created \"Lord Inverary, Mull, Morvern and Tiry, Viscount of Lochow and Glenilla ; Earl of Campbell and Cowal, Marquis of Kintyre and Lome, and Duke of Argyle.\" submit itself to the will ofthe court, and so, in the \"cold shade of opposition,\" he spent the rest of his days. The name of the Duke meets us again and again in the writers of the time. Thomson says that in him Scotland saw Her every virtue, every grace combined, Her genius, wisdom, her engaging turn, Her pride of honour, and of courage tried, Calm and intrepid, in the very throat Of sulphurous war, on Tenier's dreadful field. Nor less the palm of peace enwreaths thy brow. For, powerful as thy sword, from thy rich tongue Persuasion flows, and wins the high debate. But Pope's couplet, as it is far shorter, is also far neater. His son John, Duke of Argyle and Greenwick, was certainly one of the greatest of the name. At the age of seventeen he highly distinguished him self in the wars ; he vvas a statesman who did much to bring about the union, he defended the Hanoverian cause success fully in the rising of the '15, and was re paid with the usual ingratitude of princes. But his haughty spirit could not stoop to Argyle, the state's whole thunder born to wield, And shake alike the senate and the field.

The tourist is glad to make his visit to it short; indeed, one is little inclined to do more than make it a sleeping-place while one halts a day or two to make brief excursions in its neighbourhood. Alexander Smith, who loved the island so well, does his best for it when he tells of its noble bay, and speaks of the houses \" at a little distance\" as \"white as shells, \" and says that \" as in summer they are all set in the greenness of \u2014 a synonym for Port - Royal \u2014 from the fact that James V. of Scotland an- chored here for some time in the course of a voyage amongst the Western Islands.

It will be enough to wander away through the wood behind the little United Presbyterian church, and get a view \u2014 and it is a glorious view \u2014 of the sea, with the Storr Rock to the north, and the Cuchullin (pronounced Coollin) Hills to the south. But if we must linger a day or two, let us make the acquaintance of every hill-top in the neighbourhood, especially of that above the Tweed-mill ; we know few finer prospects than that of sea and mountain and island which is gained from its gentle height. It may be possible to combine with a visit to Storr a trip to Prince Charles' s Cave, \" a piece of natural rockwork, moulded outwardly like a cathedral window, and large and lofty in the in terior;\" but the best way is to make a little excursion by boat direct to the cave, which is only four miles from Por tree. It gets its name from the tradition that in the course of the Prince's flight he passed one night in this lonely spot ; per haps it is rather the fitness of the place to afford such a shelter than any historical proof at all which lies at the foundation of the legend. But there is something very grand about the place, with its stalactite roof and its altar-like sanctum ; it is a scene once visited, never to be forgotten. But we must hasten onward in our tour of pen-and-ink, for our wanderings in Skye must necessarilybebrief \u2014 limited not by time, but by sheets of paper.

But really the ascent, though difficult, is, we think, scarcely so bad as some people say; unless, indeed, it has been a wet season \u2014 no rare event in Skye. We cannot claim to be very dauntless in mountain climbing, and we did not find the Qui raing so very dreadful as we had thought. Certainly, if you were to do such a stiff bit of ascent \u2014 say in Switzerland \u2014 you would think yourself justified in writing home somewhat self-complacently of your venture ; but that is the most that can be said. And, after all, you know the most is made in letters home of what one does in Switzerland. believe ever afterwards the misty and spectral Ossian to be authentic. The Quirang [we use Smith's own spelling here] is a nightmare of Nature ; .... it might be the scene of a Walpurgis night.\" Smith seems to have been full of the eerie idea of Skye scenery, and hence more prosaic people than he vvas must take his description of such a scene as this with some modifi cation. \"The Quirang,\" says he, \"is frozen terror and superstition. 'Tis a huge spire or cathedral of rock, some thousand feet in height, with rocky spires or needles sticking out of it. Macbeth's weird sisters stand on the blasted heath, and Quirang stands in a region as wild as itself.

Everywhere about you are pillars of basalt, crags, and precipices. You are now about fifteen hundred feet above the sea, and it is indeed awesome to look down upon its waters, as they beat upon the shore, from your nook among the crags. As your eyes wander away seaward, if the day be very clear, you can discern in the far-off north, per haps, the Island of Lewis ; while yonder to the eastward, and beyond the channel which divides you from the mainland, are the mountains of Ross-shire, grey and grim. Study the scenery well, dear reader, for perchance, if it be clear now, it will be all mist about you when you \u2022reach the summit. To our mind there are few grander prospects \u2014 if many kindlier \u2014 than this from the Quiraing; and what is grandest to us in it all is the great and wide sea itself, with the islands, each of them with its mountain peak, boldy standing up and scattered amid its waters. that bit of descent before you set a \"stout heart\" once more to the \" stey brae.\" Having toiled up this last steep, you find yourself upon a circular plateau carpeted with grass of the richest green, reminding you somewhat (in shape only) of the Mount of Transfiguration as re- presented in a famous picture. Here, upon this verdant level, you will be glad to rest awhile, and take in your sur- roundings; if, indeed, the mist be not all round you, as it vvas certainly around us when we reached the top. We could, indeed, see nothing but the nearer view, the mountains more awful than ever thus hemmed in with cloud, and the sea at the foot ofthe table- land washing the rocks below. Let us hope, however, that you are more fortunate in your visit; if so, there will be a glorious panorama \u2014 still grander than that to be seen from the \"Needle\" \u2014 to repay you: blue sea, blue sky, fair islands shin- ing in the sun, grim mountains which the sun seems cheating into a smile, mad torrents rushing from their hilly home, and forced, wild as they are, to sparkle in this sunshine somewhat merrily as they descend. Yes, we have been on the Rigi-Kulm; we have stood on the Gorncr-Grat amid scenes of ice and snow; but we know not whether even there Nature looks more beautiful than here. You have yet a stiff bit of climbing before you, for though the summit \u2014 which is the Quiraing proper \u2014 is only something less than three hundred feet from where you now are, you have to .descend somewhat first before you can ascend it.

You have to pick your way down the other side of the hill somewhat warily, but, after all, there is no serious danger in the descent. For ourselves we have a loving memory of this rough walk from Sligachan, which we took, now a good many years ago, along with a delightful companion \u2014 now, alas, no longer with us \u2014 and under the auspices of an excellent guide. You have the advantage by this route of gaining some splendid views of the Cuchullin range, and especially of Scoor-na-Gillean, the grandest of all its peaks, whose summit (3,220 feet) vvas first reached by that ardent climber, the late Principal Forbes of St. Andrew's, in 1S36. But, if you have any ladies with you, dear reader, or if you are yourself somewhat tender footed, you had better, perhaps, ride from Sligachan, ox wait until you can reach Coruisk by way of Loch Scavaig. gaps in our de- scription of its places of interest and beauty, and here once more we are of necessity compelled to omit many important scenes in Skye. Very sorry are we, for instance, to omit any reference to Dunve gan and Duntulm Castles \u2014 the former a grandly grim object, standing, as it were, in defiance of the play of storm and tempest, with three sides of its ancient wall open to the sea, and noteworthy for this, amongst other things, that here Sir Walter Scott composed his\"Mac rimmon's Lament\"; the latter an ancient ruin, the home in other days of the Macdonalds. But we must content our selves with this mere hint of both, in order to make, room for a few words about Coruisk, grimmest and most ter ribly still of all Scottish lochs. There are two ways of reaching Loch Coruisk \u2014 the one from the sea, by Loch Scavaig; the other from Portree, by way of Sligachan. The former has the ad vantage of being, on the whole, the easier mode of approach, especially for those who approach Skye from Strome Ferry. It has, moreover, the added interest of enabling the visitor to land just where tradition makes the Bruce land, as all readers of Scott's \" Lord of the Isles\" will remember. But if you should chance to have made Portree your port in coming to the island, then make your way by mail coach to Sliga chan, and, sleeping there, start the next morning early and walk to the loch. It is a glorious mountain walk of nine miles Arrived at the loch, you will own to yourself that it is one of the most awfully still places you have ever seen. The little lake (for it is only about five miles in circumference), itself so quiet, has its quietness answered in the dread silence of Ben Blaavin and the whole amphi theatre of mountains encircling it.

How welcome to you the while are these little bits of green by the waterside, these stunted bits of bog- myrtle and the like; and how rich seems the growth upon yonder little island in the middle of the loch ! How poor we should call such specimens of vegetable life anywhere else; but here they are delightful, and, long years afterward, when you think of them, you will think of them still as wondrously fair!

Fainter and more musical they grow; fainter, sweeter, and more remote, until at last they come on your ear as if from the blank of the sky itself.\" To Alexander Smith, indeed, Loch Coruisk seems to have been more poeti cally terrible than it would be to most of us. Few will be so overpowered as to say with him, \" I would not spend a day in that solitude for the world : I should go mad before evening.\" But to most travellers whom surroundings and circumstances impress at all, Coruisk once visited, will ever remain a picture of Nature in her loneliest and most dreadful mood. And this is Coruisk. Says Alexander Smith: \u2014 \"Conceive a large lake filled with dark green water, girt with torn and shattered precipices; the bases of which are strewn with ruin, since an earthquake passed that way, and whose summits jag the sky with grisly splinter and peak. There is no motion here save the white vapour streaming from the abyss. The utter silence weighs like a burden upon you ; you feel as an intruder in the place. The hills seem to possess some secret, to brood over some unutterable idea which you can never know. You cannot feel comfort able at Loch Coruisk, and the comfort arises in great degree from the feeling that you are outside of everything; that the thunder-splitten peaks have a life with which you cannot intermeddle.

In order to settle it peaceably, they agreed that a boat's crew should be picked from each island, that the skiffs manned by these should start from a definite point at the same time, and they who reached the island first should have it. The race vvas a long and exciting one, but towards the close the Macdonalds from Uist drew decidedly, though not very far, ahead, and it soon became certain that they would get to land first. Macleod, the chief of the Harris men, seeing this, seized a sword, smote off his left hand, and threw it right over the heads of the other crew on to the island. This act was said to have given them the victory. most western of all the Scottish islands, and it is as primitive place as one could well imagine. It is out of the ordinary track, alike of tourists and of traders. It is difficult of access, and there is not very much to be seen when you do get there. There are no famed his- toric remains as there are in Iona; there are no great natural wonders as there are in Staffa ; there is simply a little rock, constituting That utmost shore, whose lonely race Resign the setting sun to Indian worlds. There is some need for tradition to fill up gaps in the history of the island, for it is not till the 14th century that we have any mention of it in historical documents. About the end of that cen tury it vvas given, by special charter granted by the Lord of the Isles with confirmation of Robert II., to his son Reginald. It then passed to the Mac donalds of Sleat, and afterwards to the Macleods, who have possessed it for up wards of three hundred years. If Boswell had followed Dr. Johnson's advice, it might have passed into his hands, as may be seen from the following comical conversation, in which the ponderous pleasantry ofthe Doctor seems to leave Boswell in doubt as to whether he is being bantered or not. Boswell once told Johnson that he thought of buying it. \"Pray do, sir,\" briskly replied the Doctor. \"We will go and pass a winter amid the blasts there (a change from Fleet-street, indeed!) We shall have fine fish, and we will take some dried tongues with us, and some books.

The population of St. Kilda is under 100, that is, the human population, but the feathered population is so enormous as to be quite incalculable. When sit ting they cover vast spaces of rock, and when a shot is fired they rise in such numbers as almost to obscure the sky. Their cries are by no means a mere dis cordant chatter. Several observers as sert that they form a sort of natural orchestra\u2014 that the various notes of the various birds combine to make a pleasing and striking harmony. Of the sea-birds the chief kinds are, Great Hawk, Gannet, Fulmar Petrel, Puffin, Stormy Petrel, gulls of various kinds, Kittiwake, etc. Eagles occasionally build their nests there, and the king of birds, with a fine sense of honour, never seizes upon any of the St. Kilda lambs or hens, but im ports them from some of the other islands, or from the mainland. Prosaic observers have been inclined to ascribe this to the amount of eggs on the island, which affords ample provision for the wants of the eagles. To catch the sea birds is the chief occupation of the St. Kilda islanders. To succeed in this it is necessary that they should be able to climb up and down the cliffs in all directions. This is a very difficult and dangerous task, and fatal accidents are of somewhat frequent occurrence.

St. Kilda is, as will be readily inferred from the above, a very small island. It is about three miles long, and at one part two miles broad. The circumference is seven miles. There are a few smaller islands, or rather rocks rising out of the water, near it. It is almost entirely sur rounded by a wall of lofty and rugged rocks, against which the sea beats with impetuous violence. The cliffs are pierced with a great number of caves, which are well known to the islanders, and specified by various names, as Gco-nan plaideachan, which sounding appellation only means the creek of the blankets, since here \"the natives lie all night, watching the arrival of the Fulmar, cov ered with thick blankets to protect them from the ocean's spray.\" There are many heights in the interior of the island, but between them lies a fairish amount of good pasture land.
