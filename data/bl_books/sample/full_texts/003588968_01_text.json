The first inhabitants of Britain were a Celtic race, who had in all probability emigrated thither from the neighbouring country of France, or Gaul. Their lan- guage, religion, manners, and government, were almost entirely the same with those of the Gauls; and when the Romans first visited Britain, a close political alliance existed be- tween the states of the two countries. At this period, C\u00e6sar informs us, there existed a tradition among the Britons that the inhabitants of the south-east maritime parts of the country had come over from Belgium, and seized by violence upon the districts which they occupied. There was a marked distinction, he adds, between them and the tribes in the interior. The latter were much more rude in their manners, and altogether less advanced in civilization, than the former. They knew nothing of tillage or agriculture, but maintained themselves by hunting and pasturage, were clothed in the skins of wild beasts, and dwelt in huts constructed of wood or of wattled work, covered with straw, and usually located in the forests and marshes. They were extremely migratory in their habits, often shifting their habitation either for the convenience of feeding their cattle, or for the purpose of avoiding the attacks of their enemies. They were divided into a great number of small tribes, each of which-i 0- /&& ?\u25a0 had its own chief, and formed in all respects a distinct and independent state. The form of government was monarchical, and there was no distinction of sexes in the succession to the royal office ; but the authority of the princes was exceedingly limited, and not a few of the royal prerogatives were usurped by the nobility and the priests. Occasional confederacies appear to have been formed by certain of the British tribes for the purpose of common defence or aggression ; but there was no general or permanent confederacy among the various states. On the contrary, they were continually agitated by jealousy and mutual animosity, and were very gener- ally at war one with another. Our knowledge of the arts of life practised by the primitive inhabitants of Britain is extremely limited and imperfect, but there is every reason to conclude that they pos- sessed very little internal trade or foreign commerce. The tribes who inhabited the interior of the country, as they never sowed their lands, but lived upon the flesh and milk of their flocks and herds and the spoils of the chase, could have had very few articles to barter with their neighbours. But the people of Kent, and the other tribes who dwelt in the vicinity of the British Channel, possessed considerable knowledge of agri- culture, and carried on some commercial *$\\ 1"], [40, "[b.c 54. 2 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. awing and terrifying their votaries, they practised their rites in dark groves, or other secret recesses. intercourse with their kinsmen, and neigh bours on the Gallic coasts. Tin, lead, and skins were the principal articles of com merce, and the trade in them seems to have been in the exclusive possession of the Ph\u0153nicians, and their colonists settled in Africa and the south of Spain. The ancient form of Druidical religion was the worship of the celestial luminaries and of fire. Another of the practices of primitive Druidism appears to have been the worship of the serpent. At a later period, however, its objects of worship became much more numerous. C\u00e6sar mentions that in his day the chief object of their adoration was Mercury, whom they regarded as the inventor of all arts, as the guide of men in highways and in their journeys, and as having the greatest power in every thing connected with the pursuits of commerce and wealth. Next to him they worshipped Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. When they were about to engage in battle, they dedicated to Mars all the spoil they should take in war. After the termination of the fight they sacrificed to him everything that was alive, and the rest of the consecrated offering was gathered together into one spot in some wood or forest, where it was left in safety, protected only by the safeguard of religious terror. C\u00e6sar adds that the Celtic race believed, on the authority ofthe Druids, that they were descended from Father Dis, or Pluto. On this account they reckoned time by nights, not by days, and so regu lated their birthdays and the beginning of months and years, that the night came first and then the day. According to the Pla tonic philosopher, Maximus Tyrius, the Celtic tribes all worshipped Jupiter under the visible representation of a lofty oak. It is certain that the Druids taught that the oak was peculiarly sacred above all other trees, and that any thing growing upon it came from heaven. They held the misle toe, therefore, in the greatest reverence when it was found on the tree. The cere mony of gathering this parasitical plant was performed on the sixth of the moon with great solemnity and pomp, and was followed by sacrifices and festive reioicings. The art of divination was one of the favourite pretensions of the Druids, and the The religion of the ancient Britons, like that of their Gallic kinsmen, was Druidical ; and C\u00e6sar informs us that it was the com mon opinion of the latter that the system was discovered or invented in Britain. The Druidical priests possessed the highest auth ority among the people ; they were not only the ministers of religion, and the sole direc tors of sacred rites and ceremonies, but the chief legislators and administrators of the law, and exercised both civil and criminal jurisdiction. All disputes among states, as well as among private persons, were referred to their decision, and obedience to their sen tences was enforced by the terrors of religion. Whoever refused to submit to their decree was interdicted from being present at the sacrifices or public worship, was not only excluded from all offices of honour and trust, but was refused the protection of the law, and was cut off from all intercourse with his fellow citizens, by whom he was universally shunned . as impious and accursed. The Druids also presided over the education of youth, and they enjoyed exemption from military service, and from all public taxes. With regard to their doctrines, we are informed that they taught the eternal trans migration of souls, as an article of faith which exercised a most powerful influence in in stilling heroic virtue into the minds of men. They also instructed their pupils respecting the nature and motions of the heavenly bodies, the magnitude of the earth and of the universe, the nature of things, and the power of the immortal gods. They communicated their doctrines only to the initiated, and strictly forbade the committing of them to writing, in order that their system might be kept secret from the great body of the people. Probably for the same reason, as well as for the purpose of over-"], [41, "B.C. 54.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 3 practice of magic in all its departments flourished among them. They were in the habit of offering up human sacrifices, and inspection of the entrails of the victims thus cruelly put to death was one of their chief methods of divination. They held that the gods were not to be propitiated unless life were offered up for life, and therefore human victims were immolated on behalf of persons who were attacked by any serious disease, or who were involved in the dangers of war. Strabo states that sometimes the victims were crucified, sometimes shot to death with arrows. Sacrifices of the same kind were on certain occasions offered on behalf of the state, and for this purpose images of wicker work or straw were constructed, and after being filled with living men they were set fire to, and the miserable victims, consist ing sometimes of condemned criminals or prisoners taken in war, but at other times of innocent persons, perished in the flames. of the British tribes when Julius C\u00e6sar, having established the Roman supremacy over the Gauls and Belgians, cast his eye upon Britain, and resolved to carry his victorious arms among the kindred tribes who inhabited that island, which was then almost entirely unknown to the conquerors of the world. Accordingly, in the year 55 B.C., he crossed the British Channel in the first instance, as he has himself in formed us, merely to learn the character of the people, and to survey the coasts and harbours of the island, as the season was too far advanced for military operations. The British chiefs, having received notice of his intention, endeavoured to avert hostilities by sending over ambassadors with an offer of hostages, and submission to the Roman authority. But though he received these overtures kindly, C\u00e6sar persevered in his design, and having set sail from Portus Itius, or Witsand, between Calais and Boulogne, about the end of August, with a force of about 12,000 infantry, he landed on an open flat shore, probably between Walmer Castle and Sandwich. The natives made a bold attempt to prevent the landing of the invaders; but after a short, though fierce contest, they yielded to superior skill and discipline, and withdrew in disorder from the well-contested beach. Thus de feated in battle they next, with the usual policy of savage tribes, endeavoured to effect a hollow peace, and sent ambassadors to the Roman general, offering hostages and an entire submission. These terms were at once accepted by C\u00e6sar, and the native tribes then pretended to have laid down their arms. The Druidical priesthood appears to have been divided into three orders or classes \u2014 the Druids, the Vates, and the Bards. C\u00e6sar mentions that there was one chief Druid, who exercised supreme authority over the whole body, and was elected by the suffrages of the other priests. This important office was, as might be expected, the object of a keen competition, and the struggle for the primacy sometimes led to a contest of arms among the various can didates. , The Romans, after they had succeeded in establishing their authority in Britain, with unwonted severity sought to abolish the Druidical system by penal statutes; but it long survived, though in obscurity and comparative weakness, the denunciations of the imperial edicts ; and its worship ap pears to have been practised by the people several ages after the Druids as a priestly order were extinct. Even at the present day some traces of the rites and ceremonies of this dark, old,- idolatrous worship may still be traced in our popular sports and anniversary customs. On the day that this peace was concluded, however, the transports which conveyed the Roman cavalry, when they were close to the British coast, and within view of C\u00e6sar's camp, were dispersed by a tempest, and driven back to Gaul; and on that night the Roman galleys, which were hauled up on the beach, were either dashed to pieces or dis abled by a high tide. This disaster spread consternation through the Roman army, and Such was the character and the condition"], [42, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. B.C. 55\u2014 a.d. 43. 4 gave fresh courage to the natives, who im mediately flew to arms, attacked and nearly cut off one of C\u00e6sar's foraging parties, and even prepared to make an assault on his entrenched camp. But the Roman general, anticipating their movements, drew uj) his legions in front of his entrenchments, and falling upon the islanders, soon put them to flight, with great slaughter. A second time they sued for peace, which was readily granted them, on condition that they would give double the number of hostages they had previously promised ; and as the equinox was approaching, and his ships were leaky, C\u00e6sar, without even waiting for the hostages, at once set sail, and arrived safely in Gaul. command of the confederated forces. Al though the natives fought with desperate courage, and gained some advantages over the invaders, mainly by the use of their war chariots armed with scythes and hooks, their long and unwieldy weapons, made of copper and tin, were no match for the Roman swords and javelins, made of well-tempered Spanish steel; and in the end, well-trained courage and skill triumphed over undisciplined valour and patriotism. The invaders were victorious in every action, passed the Thames in the face of the enemy, took and burned the capital of Cassivelaunus, and compelled that prince to sue for peace. Having thus reduced the maritime states of Britain to a nominal submission to the Roman authority, C\u00e6sar again withdrew his forces and returned into Gaul, having, as Tacitus remarks, been a discoverer rather than a conqueror. The British chiefs, relieved from the pre sence of the invader, of course failed to per form their stipulations, and by this breach of treaty afforded the Roman general a plaus ible pretext for renewing his invasion of their country. In the spring of the follow ing year (b.c 54) he again embarked for Britain, with a force which must have amounted to about 32,000 men. Daunted by this formidable armament the natives retired from the coast, and allowed the in vaders to disembark without opposition. C\u00e6sar lost no time in following the retreating enemy, and by a rapid night march overtook and defeated them on the bank of a river, probably not far from Canterbury. They retired into a position in the midst of a forest, strongly fortified both by nature and art; but the entrenchments were carried by the seventh legion after a fierce struggle, and the Britons were driven from the cover of the wood, though the danger of following them through an unknown country made C\u00e6sar forbid all pursuit. The news of a great disaster which had meanwhile befallen his fleet, not less than forty vessels having been driven ashore or destroyed by a tem pest, compelled C\u00e6sar to retrace his steps to the coast, and re-invigorated the drooping confidence of the islanders, who availed themselves of this opportunity to increase their army, and to appoint Cassivelaunus, one of their petty princes, to the supreme The civil wars which soon after broke out in Italy, and turned every man's hand against his brother, saved Britain for a time from the Roman yoke ; and for nearly a century after the departure of Julius C\u00e6sar the Britons enjoyed their rude independence unmolested by foreign arms. At length (a.d. 43) the Emperor Claudius resolved to reduce them under his dominion, and for that purpose despatched Aulus Plautius, an able and experienced general, at the head of an army amounting to about 50,000 men. The natives, who were commanded by two chiefs, named Caractacus and Togodumnus, were defeated in several encounters, and the latter was slain. Considerable progress hav ing been made by Plautius in the subjugation of the southern tribes, the emperor himself resolved to visit Britain, and share the hon our of the conquest. Claudius accordingly landed on the British coast, accompanied the Roman army on its march to the north of the Thames, and after receiving the sub mission of several tribes who inhabited the south-eastern parts of the island, returned in triumph to Rome, whence he had been absent only about six months. Caractacus, however, still held out, and in spite of the utmost efforts of Plautius, and Vespasian, his"], [43, "a.d. 50-57.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 5 second in command, the Roman conquests extended only to the bank of the Thames. In a.d. 50 Ostorius Scapula was sent over to take the command of the imperial forces, and found the affairs of the Romans in a state of great disorder and depression. By his bold and energetic measures he speedily recovered all the country, as far as the Severn, which had been temporarily occupied by his prede cessor Plautius , protected the conquered terri tory by forts and lines, defeated the tribes who inhabited the eastern and midland dis tricts of the country, and then turned his arms against the Silures, a warlike race in South Wales, among whom Caractacus had taken refuge. That indomitable chief was defeated in a great battle fought on Caer- Caradoc, a lofty hill in Shropshire; and having taken refuge with his stepmother Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantines, he was basely delivered up by her to the Romans. From the camp of Ostorius he was carried, with his wife and children, to Rome, where the hero seems to have been treated by the emperor with that magnanimity which is the proper tribute to fallen greatness. the sacred groves were cut down and the altars destroyed ; and a garrison having been placed in the sacred island, Suetonius imagined that the overthrow of the priesthood would speedily secure the submission of the people. But while his operations were thus signally successful in the west, a formidable insurrection against his authority broke out in the eastern district of the country. Inflamed by the excesses of the Roman soldiers, an extensive league was formed among the conquered states; and headed by Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, who had been treated with most shocking barbarity by Catus the procurator, they flew to arms and attacked with success several of the Roman settlements, laid waste with fire and sword the colony of Camalodunum, and cut to pieces a legion which marched to its relief. Suetonius, who hastened with the utmost speed to the scene of these disasters, with the view of protecting London, a populous and flourishing colony, found on his arrival that it would be necessary to abandon that important place in order to secure the rest of the provinces. As soon as he had evacuated the town it was taken possession of by the Britons, who reduced it to ashes, and put to death such of the inhabitants as remained behind. The in- habitants of Verulamium were in like manner massacred without mercy, and in the course of a few days no fewer than 70,000 of the Romans and their confederates were put to death. These cruelties, however, were speedily avenged by Suetonius, who de- feated the Britons in a great and decisive battle with tremendous slaughter ; and Boadicea, rather than fall into the hands of the enemy, put an end to her existence by poison. Tacitus estimates that 80,000 of the Britons perished in this engagement, and in the cold-blooded and indiscriminate massacre which followed. Suetonius was soon after recalled, and left the island still unconquered, and his immediate successors were obliged merely to stand on the defen sive, without making any attempt to extend the Roman dominion. Notwithstanding the defeat and capture of Caractacus the Silures obstinately con tinued the contest with the invaders, on whom they inflicted severe losses; and at length the Roman general Ostorius sunk under the fatigue and vexation of this harass ing contest, and died, leaving the Silurian territory unconquered. . The Roman power made no progress in Britain under the two immediate successors of Ostorius ; but in the reign of Nero, Paulinus Suetonius was invested with the command (a.d. 57), and resolved to signalize his gov- ernment by the conquest of Mona, now Anglesey, the chief seat of the Druids, and the place of refuge of the defeated British princes. The natives sought to deter the invaders from this enterprise by the terrors of superstition, as well as by the force of arms, but in vain. After a desperate con flict the Britons were defeated, their priests, according to Tacitus, were burned in the fires which they had prepared for their enemies,"], [44, "6 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 75-83. After the lapse of fifteen or sixteen years spent in comparative inactivity Julius Frontenas (a.d. 75\u201478) resumed aggressive movements, and at last overcame the obstinate resistance of the Silures. He was succeeded by Cn\u00e6us Julius Agricola, the father-in-law of the historian Tacitus, whose philosophic biography has immor talized the exploits of this great commander. Agricola was profoundly skilled in the arts both of peace and war, and in seven cam paigns he not only fought his way through the various warlike tribes in the interior, with whom the Romans had not yet come in contact, but carried his victorious arms as far north as the Grampian hills. In his first three campaigns he completed the con quest of South Britain, brought the tribes in the north-western and northern districts to submission, marched as far north as the Solway Frith, at the same time carefully erecting forts as he advanced, for the purpose of keeping possession of the country he had gained. In his fourth summer (a.d. 81) he explored and overran the country extending from the Solway to the Friths of Clyde and Forth. In the following year he invaded and conquered the native tribes in the district of Galloway ; and having thus made all secure in his rear, he crossed the Frith of Forth (a.d. 83), and attacked the tribes who inhabited the district north of that estuary. The Caledonians, as this fierce and warlike race was designated by the Romans, did not shrink from the con test, and in a night attack on the ninth legion nearly succeeded in cutting it to pieces. But they were soon after defeated in a general engagement, and Agricola feeling that this success had secured the safety of his forces, and that his fleet would keep them well supplied with provisions, took up his winter quarters north of the Forth, in Fife. In his seventh and last campaign Agricola defeated 30,000 of the Caledonians, in a great pitched battle which they fought at the root of the Grampian hills, under Galgacus, a general of distin guished bravery and skill; but finding it impossible to retain possession of the terri tory which he had won by this victory, he contented himself with establishing a line of forts between the Friths of Forth and Clyde, and thus secured the more fertile parts of the island from the incursions of the northern barbarians. It is worthy of notice that it was owing to the measures of Agricola that the Romans first ascertained that Britain is an island. After the defeat of Galgacus he sent his fleet on a voyage of discovery round the north of Scotland. After doubling the promontory of Caithness and Cape Wrath, it ran down the western coast of Scotland to the Land's End; then turning to the east along the channel, and sailing thence along the eastern coast, it reached in safety the Frith of Tay, from which it had started. Agricola did not trust to arms alone for the establishment of the Roman dominion in Britain. He strove to conciliate the native tribes by acts of kindness, taught them many useful arts, a regard for the laws which he introduced, and a taste for the comforts of civilized life; instructed them in letters, and even in science; persuaded them to abandon their wandering habits and to settle in towns, to erect halls and temples, as well as convenient dwelling houses; and by thus imparting to them a share in the benefits of Roman civilization, he hoped to induce them to submit cheer fully to the imperial domination. \" The Britons,\" says Tacitus, \"willingly supply our armies with recruits, pay their taxes without a murmur, and they perform all the services of government with alacrity, pro vided they have no reason to complain of oppression. When injured their resent ment is quick, sudden, and impatient; they are conquered, not spirit-broken ; they may be reduced to obedience, not to slavery.\" Soon after his last campaign in Caledonia, Agricola was recalled by the jealous tyrant Domitian; and such was the effect of his wise and vigorous policy, that for thirty years Britain remained so tranquil that its affairs are scarcely ever mentioned in the"], [45, "a.d. 120-297.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 7 Roman annals. But in the reign of Hadrian the Caledonians made such frequent and fierce attacks along the northern frontiers of the Roman province, that the conquests of Agricola north of the Tyne and Solway were all lost, and the chain of forts which he had erected between the Forth and the Clyde were swept away. The emperor himself found it necessary to visit the island, in 120, in order to restore tranquillity, and without attempting to reconquer the terri tory beyond, he prudently contented him self with securing the more fertile region by erecting, between the Solway and the German Ocean, a new and much stronger rampart than that which had been built by Agricola. In the reign of Antoninus Pius (138), Lollius Urbicus, who then held the office of governor of Britain, advanced beyond this line, and again extended the Roman frontier to the isthmus between the Clyde and Forth, where he erected a strong rampart thirty-one miles in length, with a military road in the line of Agricola's forts. In the reign of Commodus (183), the northern barbarians again broke through this barrier, and swept over the country as far as the wall of Hadrian. Their destruc tive ravages continued for upwards of twenty years, until the Emperor Severus resolved, in 207, to lead an army in person against these barbarous tribes. On landing in South Britain, he lost no time in marching to the northern frontier at the head of a powerful army, and crossing the walls of Agricola and Hadrian he penetrated into Caledonia as far as the Moray Frith, a point considerably beyond the limits attained by any of his predecessors. This expedition, which is said to have cost him 50,000 men, who were cut off partly by the sword of the enemy, partly by privations and incessant toil, had no permanent effect in subduing the northern tribes. No Roman army ever followed in its track, and Severus, abandon ing even the ground between the Tyne and the Forth, contented himself with rebuilding and strengthening the defences of Hadrian's wall, in the hope that it might prove an effective barrier against the incursions of the Caledonians. Severus died at York in the early part of the year 211, while on his march northward a second time against the Caledonian tribes. His son and successor, Caracalla, tired of a warfare involving so much danger and toil, and from which so little was to be gained, made a hasty peace with the northern clans, and formally ceded to them all the debatable country between the Solway and the Tyne and the Friths of Clyde and Forth. For the space of nearly seventy years from the date of this peace the history of Britain is almost a total blank. There is every rea son to believe, however, that the country enjoyed both internal tranquillity and free dom from external invasion. The tribes inhabiting the fertile territory ceded by Caracalla seem to have made considerable progress in civilization and industrial habits, and to have formed a kind of breakwater averting the assaults of the barbarous moun taineers on the Roman province. Towards the close of the third century the Scandina vian and Saxon pirates began to ravage the coasts of Britain, but were defeated and driven away by Carausius, a Menapian, a bold and skilful naval officer, whom the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian ap pointed to the command of a powerful fleet, despatched for the protection of the coasts of Gaul and Britain. His imperial masters became jealous of him, accusing him of collu sion with the enemy, and sought to put him to death; but he took refuge in Britain, where the legions and auxiliaries embraced his cause and acknowledged him as emperor. All efforts to reduce him by force of arms having failed, the joint emperors were at length compelled to acknowledge his author ity, and to concede to him the sovereignty of Britain and of the coast of Gaul. His skill and courage gave him the complete mastery of the sea from the mouths of the Rhine to the Straits of Gibraltar ; and under his sway Britain for the first time appeared as a naval power. Carausius was assassinated at York in 297 by Allectus, a Briton, who"], [46, "8 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 306-420. seized his sceptre and reigned for about three years, when he in turn was defeated and slain by an officer of Constantius Chlorus, to whom Britain fell on the abdication of Dio cletian and Maximian, in 296. On his death at York, in 306, his son and successor, Con stantine the Great, on his accession to the throne, entered on a campaign against the northern tribes beyond the wall of Severus ; but very little is known of his operations, and he soon after left the island for ever. this period, however, the Romans, reduced to the greatest extremities themselves by the reiterated and merciless attacks of the Goths and Huns, could no longer extend their pro tection to a distant province like Britain, and at length the Emperor Honorius, about the year 420, was compelled by his exigencies to recall his troops ; and after exhorting the Britons to arm in their own defence, the imperial government finally abandoned the island, of the greater part of which the Romans had been masters for nearly four centuries. After the death of Constantine the Roman empire exhibited unmistakable symptoms of decay, and the fierce and barbarous tribes on its frontiers wasted its distant provinces, and began to threaten its centre. Britain soon felt the effect of this decrepitude of the im perial authority. Its ill-defended southern coasts were ravaged by the Frank and Saxon pirates, while the Picts and Scots broke through the wall of Severus, or turned it on its flanks in their coracles, and wasted the northern and central provinces. At this period, too, Britain was described as \"an island fertile in usurpers,\" and the resources of the country were drained by a succession of pretenders to the imperial purple, who raised their standard in Britain, and carried off the flower of the British youth to fight their battles for empire in Spain and France and Italy. The northern tribes promptly availed themselves of the favourable op portunities thus afforded them to renew tneir depredations in Britain; and though repeatedly defeated and expelled by Chry santus, the lieutenant of Theodosius the Great, by the famous Stilicho, Constantius, and other brave and skilful generals, these devastating hordes, after a short breathing time, renewed their invasion of the un happy island, leaving a wilderness behind them wherever they went. On two separate occasions the Britons made an earnest sup plication to Rome for help, and twice a legion was sent over for their protection. But the Picts and Scots, though routed and chased by these troops into their native fast nesses, returned with increased fury when ever the auxiliary force was withdrawn. At The Emperor Honorius, in his farewell letter, virtually released the Britons from their allegiance, and authorized the indepen dent establishment of a native government, which he could neither prevent nor support. The British provincials, indeed, abandoned by the imperial forces which the usurper Con stantine had carried into Gaul, and harassed by the incursions of the barbarous Caledo nians and Scots, had already assumed the care and asserted the right of national inde pendence. Although the final separation between Rome and Britain seems to have been quite amicable, the Britons, when they found that they could no longer trust for defence to the Roman power, had before this deprived the imperial magistrates of their offices, taken up arms under leaders of their own choice, and, in the awakened spirit of freedom, had at the outset repulsed the barbarians beyond the northern limits of their territory. From the letters of Honorius having been addressed to the cities of Britain (of which there were then in the island alto gether thirty-three, invested, according to the Roman system, with superior privileges of various degrees above the ordinary towns), there is reason to conclude that these muni cipal commonwealths had now in the national revolt been suffered to assume the supreme administration of the adjacent districts. It has also been plausibly conjectured that the leaders of the military forces of these petty states gradually availed themselves of the disasters which must have followed the over-"], [47, "A.D. 441.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 9 throw of the imperial government to usurp the sovereign power. But all traces of these municipal or republican governments end with the meagre records of their first inde pendence; and we only know with tolerable certainty that forty years later the fragments of the imperial dominion in the island were shared among a great number of kings, or, more properly, petty chieftains, some pro bably of Roman and the rest of native descent, who appear by their perpetual dis sensions and struggles for ascendancy to have plunged the whole of South Britain into total anarchy, and to have aggravated the miseries which now again afflicted their wretched people from the fierce incursions of the northern tribes. Rome for help, Vortigern called in the aid of the Saxon marauders, some allege for the purpose of protecting his countrymen from the Picts and Scots, while others are of opinion that his object was rather to bring about the destruction of the Roman paity in the island than the expulsion of the northern invaders. Whatever were his motives, the piratical rovers of the Baltic and Northern Germany readily obeyed the call of the British chief, which was followed by consequences of which he little dreamed, and ultimately led to the conquest of a kingdom. There can be no doubt that the establish- ment of the Roman authority in Britain was attended with immense benefit to the in- habitants. The internal tranquillity of the country was preserved, the southern coasts were protected against the Saxon pirates, and the northern frontiers were freed from the incursions of the Scots and Picts. The natural resources of the country were de- veloped, and its foreign trade was vastly extended. In addition to its ancient metallic productions, immense quantities of corn were exported by Britain ; and in the fourth century the armies of Gaul and Germany depended in a great measure for their sub- sistence on the annual supplies furnished by this country. The great highways formed by this remarkable people, the remains of which still excite admiration, opened up the island in every direction, and contributed vastly to the development of its internal traffic. Marshes were drained, forests swept away with the beasts of prey by which they were tenanted, and instead of mud hovels, clustered together in woods and morasses with a view to defence rather than comfort, numerous towns arose, populous and wealthy, adorned with temples, courts of justice, theatres, and other public buildings and monuments, and exhibiting for the first time long streets of regular stately mansions of brick or stone, richly decorated both within and without, and silled with costly furniture and statues, and other works of art. \" The country was replete,\" says Sir Francis Pal- As there was no longer any security for fife or property, agriculture was neglected; internal trade was destroyed, as well as foreign commerce; famine and pestilence ensued, and the country, devastated by civil war and foreign invasion, was still further depopu- lated by these two scourges of the human race. The wretched inhabitants thus assailed on all sides, and suffering equally from hunger and from the enemy, were driven from their habitations, and sought refuge, like their ancestors five centuries earlier, among the forests and mountains. In this deplorable condition they are said to have addressed, in 441, an earnest supplication for succour to \u00c6tius, thrice consul, and a brave and skilful warrior. But the terrible in *asion of Attila at this period was tasking to the uttermost the resources of the Roman general, and rendered it impossible for him to afford the slightest assistance to these despairing supplicants. To add to the misery of the wretched Britons at this terrible crisis, there arose two great factions in the southern part of the island, who appear to have absorbed all the rest \u2014 a Roman party, headed by Aurc lius Ambrosius, a descendant of one of the emperors; and a British party, led by the well-known Vortigern, whose dissensions completed the ruin of the country.

Malmesbury appeals to those stately ruins as testimonies of the favour which Britain had enjoyed; the towns, the temples, the theatres, and the baths which yet remained undestroyed, excited the won der and admiration of the chronicler and the traveller; and even in the fourteenth century the edifices raised by the Romans were so numerous and costly as almost to excel any others on this side the Alps. Nor were these structures among the least influential means of establishing the Roman power. Architecture, as cultivated by the ancients, was not merely presented to the eye; the art spake also to the mind. The walls were covered with the decrees of the legislature, engraved on bronze or sculptured on the marble ; the triumphal arches crowned by the statues of the princes who governed the province from the distant Quirinal; the tesselated floor pictured with the mythology of the state whose sovereign was its pontiff' \u2014 all contributed to act upon the feelings of the people, and to impress them with respect and submission.

But after the destruction of the Druidical priesthood by the swords of the Roman conquerors there is reason to believe that Christianity was rapidly, though gra- dually, diffused throughout the country, and was openly professed by large masses of the people. Tertullian, writing in 209, men- tions that \" even those places in Britain hitherto inaccessible to the Roman arms have been subdued by the gospel of Christ,\" from which we may fairly infer that the new religion must have taken deep root in the southern districts, and have become the dominant faith of the people, before it could have penetrated into the barbarous regions beyond the Roman province. Towards the close of the third century the British Chris- tians shared in the great persecution under Diocletian, in which St. Alban, the proto- martyr of Britain, and a large number of the disciples of Jesus perished, multitudes saved their lives by flight, and many Christian churches were destroyed. These severities, however, continued only for the space of two years, and on the abdication of Diocle- tian and his colleague Maximian, the British church was restored to its former tranquil- lity. After the accession of Constantine the church of Britain, which had hitherto remained in a secluded position, was brought into prominent and intimate connection with the spiritual system which that emperor established, shared in its power and splen dour, and exhibited similar results. The only ostensible difference between the British church and the churches of the Continent at But by far the most important of the blessings for which the Britons were in debted to the Roman dominion was their deliverance from a cruel and debasing super stition, and their conversion to the Christian faith. Historians are not agreed, either as to the time of the introduction of Christian ity into Britain, or the persons by whose instrumentality it was effected. It is by no means improbable, as has been asserted, that even before the close of the first century Christian exiles from the Continent may have found refuge in this island, or that Christian soldiers and civilians may have accompanied the invading armies sent to its shores. All that can be positively affirmed, however, on this point is, that at an early period the Christian religion was embraced by a portion of the inhabitants of Britain. The stories recorded or invented by the monastic writers are utterly unworthy of this period consisted in the time of keeping Easter, which the former observed according to the Asiatic, the latter according to the Roman, computation. In regard to pilgrim ages to the Holy Land, the institution of monkish orders, and other religious follies of the age, the British Christians seem to have followed closely in the footsteps of their continental brethren. Before resuming our narrative of the vast influence which the invitation given to the hardy freebooters of Northern Ger many exerted on the suture history of"], [49, "A.D. 431.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 11 Britain, we may appropriately advert to some inquiries into the political origin of those tribes of the great Gothic race, from whom we derive our language, our laws, and the mass of our national population. Before the second century of the Christian era scarcely any distinct traces are dis coverable of the people, whose descendants occupy the circle of Westphalia, the king dom of Saxony, the British islands, the United States of North America, and the British colonies in the two Indies.* The very name of the Saxons escaped the notice of Tacitus, and is only first discovered in the later geography of Ptolemy the Alex andrian, by their occupation of three small islands, and a narrow neck of the Continent, at the mouth and on the northern shore of the Elbe. But in less than 200 years this obscure tribe of barbarians had ex tended their supremacy, or their name, from the Baltic to the Rhine ;f and the problem of so gigantic an expansion can only be solved by the conjecture, that the various nations of kindred Gothic race, who previously overspread those regions, had gradually blended into one general though loose confederacy, under the common appel lation of Saxons. X adventure which, in a rude and fierce state of society, is sure to be displayed in piratical enterprises; and the first successes of the Saxons in pillaging the commerce of the narrow seas between the Roman provinces of Gaul and Britain, were sufficient to in flame the cupidity and excite the imitation of neighbouring tribes New swarms of barbarians from the coasts and the interior eagerly embraced theii predatory occupa tions, swelled their numbers, and assumed their name ; and before the reign of Diocle tian their piracies had become so formidable that a new imperial officer, under the title of Count of the Saxon Shore, was estab lished, with a powerful squadron in the British Channel, expressly to check their depredations.* In the subsequent decline of the Roman power their expeditions became more frequent, their spoliations on the seas more incessant, and their descents and ravages on the coasts of the provinces more terribly destructives The character of the maritime Saxons differed only from that of the other Gothic tribes in the habits which were engendered by their nautical pursuits. Each freeborn warrior, equally by land or by sea, attached himself to the fortunes of some favourite chieftain ; and in council and in action the reputation of superior wisdom and valour formed the sole title to a voluntary obedi ence. The vessels in which these hardy barbarians committed themselves to the storms of the German Ocean, were origin ally of most insignificant size and frail materials ; but in the progress of their naval warfare they had been taught to exchange their rude boats of a few planks and osier work covered with hides, for war-ships of adequate bulk to contain 100 or even 200 warriors, and of a construction sufficiently solid and durable to brave the most tem pestuous voyages. They usually, in fact, chose the stormy season for their expedi tions, as the fittest for surprising their enemies; their valour was equally dauntless The progress and results of this union in the interior of Germany belong to the annals of continental Europe ; and the story of the long independence and final subju gation of the associated Saxons must be included in the narrative of the last vicissi tudes of the Roman empire and the san guinary victories of Charlemagne. The rise of the naval power of the Saxons is the only part of their history which elucidates our present subject. The portion of the original tribe at the mouth of the Elbe, had early fostered that spirit of maritime * Sharon Turner, History ofthe Anglo-Saxons, vol. i. p. 123. (8vo. Ed.). In this elaborate and excellent work Mr. Turner has exhausted all the learning which exists to illustrate his subject ; and without multiplying citations from his pages, it may here suffice to acknowledge our general obligation to the labours of a writer, who deserves to be characterized as the highest of all modern authorities on Anglo-Saxon antiquities and history. t Eutropius, Breviarium Hist.

The invitation was accepted by the fiery youth of Jutland; and a formidable rein forcement of 5000 warriors swelled the strength of Hengist, and established itself like the first comers in Thanet.f Yet during six years from his original debarkation, the Saxon leader performed the engagements of his service with fidelity and submission; for it was not until after that interval that, in the language of the only credible narration which we possess of the event, he is stated to have begun his kingdom in Kent. J The causes which converted such fierce auxiliaries into merci less enemies may be readily imagined : they were, the jealousy of the natives and the arrogance of the victorious strangers; the fears which were awakened in the British prince at the encroachments of his mer cenaries ; and the ambition which was excited in the rude Saxon leader at the prospect of a permanent sovereignty. At length both parties flew to arms ; a dubious struggle on the banks of the Medway was attended by the death of the brother of Hengist and of a son of Vortigern ;\u00a7 and in a more decisive battle near the river Cray the Britons were totally defeated. The whole of Kent was abandoned to the conquerors ; and several subsequent victories confirmed their possession.! We have already described the condition of Britain during the period which elapsed be tween the separation ofthe island from Rome and the invasion of the Saxons, and have shown how intestine discords had plunged the country into total anarchy, and delivered it an easy prey to the fierce barbarians of the north, who before the middle of the fifth century had extended their ravages into some of the most southern districts of the island. It was at this crisis that a small band of Saxon pirates, in three of their cyules, or long ships, under the guidance of Hengist and Horsa, who are described as brothers of the race of Woden, chanced to be ranging along the eastern coast of the British Channel in quest of adventure ; and to these leaders Gwrtheyrn, or Vortigern, the principal among the petty British kings of the south, addressed an overture for assistance in his extremity, with the promise of an ample reward. The proposal was too congenial to the habits of these martial rovers not to be eagerly embraced ; and Hen gist and Horsa landing with their followers at Ebbsfleet,f in the Isle of Thanet, were quartered in that fertile portion of Kent. Their force, from the number and size of the vessels which had brought them, could not have amounted to above 500 or 600 men, and more probably did not exceed half that strength :| but their intrepid valour rendered them powerful auxiliaries; and in concert with the native followers of the British chieftains, they are said to have repelled the incursions of the Caledonians Such, when separated from the discordant fables which disfigure the narratives of obscure British chroniclers, the earliest of them not contemporary with the events, but which the romantic credulity of later writers has implicitly copied, would appear, in our real ignorance of minute details, to be the only consistent and probable account of the first Saxon settlement in Britain. * Bede, lib. i. c. 15.

But both these representations are at utter variance with unquestionable facts. In the lapse of above three centuries under the imperial dominion, Britain, as we have shown, had become the seat of Roman culture and luxury. It had been studded with numerous cities, which reflected the image of Roman jurisprudence and manners; it was adorned with many works of elegance, of which the remains are frequently discovered even at this day; its natives had attained the rank of Roman citizens, and powerfully supported more than one candidate for the imperial purple; and, above all, the light of the gospel, the sure day-spring of civilization, had been so extensively disseminated throughout its territorial divisions, that the British church was governed by a numerous hierarchy, and represented in regular synods. Though the vicious dissensions of its petty chief tains had involved the island, after its separation from the empire, in mischievous disorders, the short period of forty years had not destroyed these foundations of civilization, and could not have sufficed to replunge the people into their pristine bar barism; and it is attested, even in the querulous pages of our only contemporary native writer, that Britain in the sixth century, notwithstanding the dreadful effect of the Caledonian and Saxon ravages, still contained twenty-eight cities, besides other fortresses of strength, and presented the aspect of cultivation and fertility.* To not much more respect are entitled several vulgar errors of an opposite tendency, on the state of Britain and the qualities of the natives at the era of the Saxon inva sions, which some modern writers have been led to propagate and repeat, from bestowing too implicit a reliance, or too literal a construction, on the hyperbolical and vituperative declamations of a splenetic monk. From this report, in which the author frequently contradicts himself, it had become fashionable, until a more ac curate spirit of investigation in late years exposed the fallacy of such views, \u00a7 to depict the Britons of the age before us under cir cumstances of barbarism little superior to That the imputation of a pusillanimous degeneracy in the Britons, the effect, as it has been imagined, of their long subjection to the Roman yoke, has no better foundation than the belief of their relapse into utter barbarism, is still more readily proved.

But Dr. Lingard has shown (Hist. vol. i. p. 94, note) that the expression of Gildas evidently refers only to the return of the Saxons into Kent; and that any other interpretation is not supported by the context. % Nennius, c. 48. \u00a7 Gibbon, c. 38, and more especially Turner, vol. i. p. 223-225, have the merit of exposing the contradictory exag- gerations of Gildas.

Of such blindness or indifference, as well as of the general spirit of warlike enterprise among the Britons at this period, there is curious and undoubted historical evidence in the fact that, at the moment when the Saxons were establishing themselves by repeated and sanguinary vic tories in Kent, a British chieftain, at the solicitation of the Emperor Anthemius, led an army of 12,000 men from Cornwall to the mouth of the Loire, to assist the Roman forces against the Visigoths.* legions, seem sufficient to show that effemi nacy or cowardice formed no features of their character. It was manifestly only their subsequent state of anarchy which invited the ravages and facilitated the inroads of the same barbarians; and the supplications for foreign aid, from which modern writers have drawn the inference of pusillanimity,* must, if indeed such entreaties had any existence, be ascribed to the effects of their intestine disorders, and arose probably from the defenceless condition of particular dis tricts. But the courageous spirit of the Britons is indubitably attested in the obsti nacy and duration of their subsequent struggle against the most valiant tribes of the Gothic race. While the Roman provin cials of Gaul, of Spain, and of Africa, abjectly yielded to the first shock of the barbarian conquerors, the natives of Britain, unaided from the Continent, and disunited among themselves, sustained for above one hundred years a vigorous, a bloody, and often a dubi ous contest with the numerous and formid able invaders, who simultaneously assailed their island along the whole extent of its eastern and southern coasts. Even the final and unsuccessful issue of the struggle still left the ancient race in independent posses sion of the mountains of Wales, and of the promontory of Cornwall. Thus slowly pro gressive as were the Saxon conquests, there is abundant reason to conclude that their ultimate success was as much attributable to the inveterate disunion, and want of all con cert among the Britons, as to any inferiority of the natives in martial prowess. The establishment of the first Saxon kingdom in Kent seems to have been invited and resisted only by the British chieftains in that quarter of the island ; and the petty princes of more Though the establishment of Hengist and his followers was the undoubted cause which excited the later Saxon descents upon the island, there was as little concert in the assaults of the invaders as in the resistance of the natives. The bands of warlike ad venturers who successively arrived on the British shores proceeded, each under its own chieftain, to win an independent conquest and to found a separate principality. The identity of their language and manners attested their kindred race ; as the contiguity of their original seats on the northern coasts of Germany also explained the common inducement of their expeditions. But under the general Saxon name they were composed principally of at least three distinct nations or tribes, the Jutes, the proper Saxons, and the Angles, f with a promiscuous admixture of other barbarians.} The Jutes, who led the way under Hengist, were spread over the northern portions of Jutland; the Saxons still held the districts near the Elbe, which we have designated, after Ptolemy, as the primitive seat of their name and tribe ; and the Angles occupied the intermediate coun try, which forms the modern duchy of * The letter in Gildas, to \u00c6tius, the imperial commander in Gaul, \"The groans ofthe Britons,\" &c. \u2014 \" the barbarians drive us into the sea and the sea drives us back on the bar barians,\" has been a hundred times quoted by the writers of our popular histories, without any inquiry into the probabilities of its genuineness. But the antithetical style of the letter, as Mr. Sharon Turner (vol. i. p. 206) has justly remarked, betrays the composition of Gildas ; and if its purport had any foundation in a partial application from the people of some southern district of the island to \u00c6tius for succour, the abject tone of the entreaty is probably only the invention of that querulous declaimer. * Sidonius Apollinaris, lib. iii. epist. 9.

The successors of Hengist were compelled to submit to this narrow restriction; and with a single mem orable exception, the annals of their little kingdom present no circumstances to arrest our attention. It was under the reign of Ethelbert, the fourth sovereign of the house of Hengist, that his subjects were the earliest among the Anglo-Saxons to receive the blessings of the gospel ; and the example and exhortations of the royal proselyte were instrumental in promoting the conversion of his people.* By the successive invasions and conquests of the Jutes, the Saxons, and the Angles, the portions of the island wrested from the natives were gradually formed into those distinct principalities or petty kingdoms which, from the kindred origin of their people rather than from any union of gov ernment among their princes, it has been customary with writers to describe under the general term, according to the shifting number of states, of an octarchy or hept archy. \u00a7 The little kingdom of Kent, the first founded by Hengist and his Jutes, did not extend towards the north beyond the Thames, while the sea formed its eastern and southern boundaries. On the west its ex pansion was prevented by the resistance of the Britons, until the arrival of the second body of invaders, whose settlement on its borders permanently confined its territory It was not until after an interval of twenty eight years from the first descent of Hengist, that his success produced the next indepen dent invasion of Britain. The new invaders, who appear to have been of the primitive Saxon race, were led by a chieftain named \u00c6lla, or Ella, and his three sons; and land ing in the Isle of Selseyf, they defeated the Britons with considerable loss, drove them for refuge into the neighbouring forest of Andredswold, and succeeded in effecting an establishment, which expanded into the kingdom of the South Saxons, or Sussex. As their original armament, like that of the Jutes, was composed but of three cyules, it has been inferred that their victorious settle ment was opposed only by the petty British chieftain of the immediate vicinity.} The defence of the natives, however, may have been obstinate ; it is certain that the progress ofthe invaders was slow. Seven years after his arrival on the coast had elapsed before Ella ventured on his first attempt to pene trate into the interior of the country; and his advance was checked by a dubious and sanguinary conflict on the river Mercread. It was five years later before the arrival of reinforcements of his countrymen from the Continent enabled the Saxon prince to pro secute his enterprise ; and the traces of his operations are preserved in the siege and fate of the British city of Andredes Ceaster. This was a place of some importance on the * Mr. Turner (vol. i. p. 169), after some authorities, places the Jutes in South Jutland ; but the words of Bede, in deducing the Angles (lib. i. c. 15) de ilia pah-id . . . inter provincial Jutarum et Saxonum, seem conclusive that this nation occupied the southern districts of Jutland (or Schleswig) between the Elbe and the seat of the Jutes, who would, therefore, appear to have inhabited the northern parts of the peninsula. And, still more, the expressions of Alfred in Orosins (Barrington, p. 20) indicate that all the southern parts of Jutland opposite to Zealand (as well as that and the other modern Danish islands) were inhabited by Angles. t Gibbon, c. 38. t So late as the eleventh century the duchy of Schleswig was called Old England. Turner, vol. i. p. 171. \u00a7 Until of late years it was customary to describe the Anglo-Saxon division of states as a heptarchy; but the ori ginal number of distinct and independent kingdoms or prin cipalities, until the first intermittent union of Deira and Bernicia, was eight; and after those provinces were finally blended into the single sovereignty of Northumbria, the other weaker states were so often subjected to the more powerful, that the title of a pentarchy or triarchy would be quite as appropriate as that of the Heptarchy.

Six years after his first descent one new band, at least, of his followers or con federate Jutes under Porta, effected a land ing, and perpetuated the name of their leader, at Portsmouth; and another body of adventurers arrived thirteen years later under the nephews of Cerdic. The progress of that celebrated chieftain himself, however, was intrepidly resisted by Natanleod, the British sovereign of the territory on which he had landed; and the warfare of these leaders now first assumed the character of a national struggle between the two contend ing races. Cerdic received some assistance from the Saxons of Kent and Sussex; and Natanleod assembled a larger army of Britons than had hitherto united in resisting the invaders. But in a general engagement Natanleod, after routing one division of the invaders under the immediate command of Cerdic, was successfully attacked in the eagerness of pursuit by Cynric, the son of the Saxon prince, and slain, with 5000 Britons.} western verge of the great forest tract, to which it gave name, and the vast extent of which has been imperfectly recorded in the narrower boundaries of the modern \"Weald of Kent.\" Andredes Ceaster was so strongly fortified, according to the ancient principles of the military art, as to be deemed by the natives impregnable ; and the tradition of its defence denotes their possession of some martial science as well as natural valour. While the Saxons besieged the place they were them selves incessantly harassed by an army of Britons from without, who made a general attack upon their camp as often as they assaulted the walls, and retired into the forest as soon as the diversion was successful. But Ella having at length adopted the ex pedient of dividing his forces into two bodies, of which one covered while the other pro secuted the siege, the efforts of the Britons from without were effectually repelled, and the walls were carried by assault. The bar barous conquerors, irritated by their losses, reduced the city to ashes, and put every soul within it to the sword.* This horrible catastrophe appears to have disheartened the British, and secured to Ella the possession of the territory which he had won ; but his conquests were not much farther extended. Though he is mentioned as superior in dig nity or power to the contemporary princes of the Jutes,} he seems to have been either satisfied with the dominion of a small pro vince, or unable to enlarge its boundaries; and the surface of the petty kingdom of Sussex, as of the Kentish principality, may be nearly identified with that of the single modern county. It was the next invader and his followers whose victories spread consternation through the south of Britain, and confirmed the previous intruders in the permanent pos session of Kent and Sussex. Eighteen years after the arrival of Ella, Cerdic, another Saxon chieftain, who, like Hengist, is said to have deduced his origin from Woden,} attributed a descent from Woden. Unless it had become a general point of vanity to deduce the origin of their leaders from the tutelary god of their race, this tradition of a common genealogy goes far to confirm the opinion of Mr. Turner (vol. i. p. 170) that \"Jutes, Saxons, and Angles were but coeval twigs of the same Teutonic branch of the great Scythian or Gothic tree.\" The pedigree of Cerdic in the ninth generation from Woden was, however, expressly defined, and the account is highly probable in itself. This genealogy would assign an existence to the deified hero of his race, of whose real era and actions we otherwise know nothing, in the beginning of the third century. * Chron. Sax. ubi supra.

The Isle of Wight was added to its dominion by the nephews of the king, after a struggle, in which those remorseless barbarians put every one of its British inhabitants to the sword ; and Cerdic having bestowed upon them the subordinate sovereignty of this acquisition, and associated his son in the paramount government of his conquests, bequeathed their prosecution to that valiant prince. During an active and fortunate reign, Cyn ric inflicted several further defeats upon the Britons, and extended his kingdom over the modern counties of Wilts, Berks, Oxford, and Buckingham ; and his son Cealwin, after a memorable defeat of three kings of the Britons, all of whom fell in the same battle, obtained possession of as many principal cities of the natives, Bath, Cirencestcr, and Gloucester, and enlarged the boundaries of Wessex to the banks of the Severn.} and in Wales ; on the east it was supported by the Saxon states of Sussex and Kent; and on the north its further enlargement was opposed by the British population, which still occupied the surface ofthe country from Gloucestershire to Scotland. The settle ment of the Jutes and Saxons might there fore have been restricted to the colonization of our southern shores, if at this juncture the third and most numerous people of the same race had not, by successive arrivals on the eastern coasts, begun from them to over spread the whole central portions of the island.* But before the Angles established their permanent settlements in the island, a fourth state had already been formed on its eastern shores by the obscure union of several bodies of Saxon adventurers, who, while Cerdic was yet prosecuting his enterprise against the Britons in the south, founded the little kingdom of Essex, or of the East Saxons. In the annals of this state, of which Erken win was the first sovereign, there is nothing to demand our notice, except its subsequent extension into Middlesex, and its acquisition of London, then, though destined to be the future metropolis of the island, known only as a town of some trade.} When the Angles commenced their inva sions of the eastern shores of Britain, their descents, unlike those of the Jutes and Sax ons, soon assumed the character of a whole national immigration. } At first, many petty chieftains and bands of this tribe endea voured to establish themselves on the coast immediately adjacent to the new kingdom of Essex. But as they failed to succeed in forming any distinct state, their desultory efforts were soon eclipsed by the more for midable expedition of Ida; who, arriving on the coast north of the Humber with a fleet of forty cyules, defeated the natives in several severe engagements, and was raised by the associated chieftains of his armament to the sovereignty of their conquests. The coun- Such was the gradual establishment ofthe power which was ultimately to acquire the supremacy over all the other Anglo-Saxon states, and to give to England a long line of princes of the race of Cerdic : but at the distance of eighty years from the first land ing of that chieftain in Britain, the kingdom of Wessex under his victorious grandson formed only a small southern portion of the island. On the west it was still confined by British principalities in Devon and Cornwall, * According to the British writers, he even sustained a signal defeat at Mount Badon, which is loosely said to have arrested the progress of the West Saxons for forty years.

Of the former, extend ing from the Tees to the Scottish stream, Ida was the first Anglian king, and trans mitted its sceptre to the eldest of his twelve sons. But on the death of the prince of their original choice a portion of his fol lowers quitted the standard of his successor, assailed the adjoining and more southern district, and there, overpowering the native population and raising a chieftain named Ella, or Sella, to the supreme command, founded the second Anglian kingdom of Deira. But a continued and obstinate strug gle of thirty years with the Britons con sumed the long reign of Ella ; nor was the expulsion or subjugation of the native race completed until after the accession of his son. By a later union under a single sove reign, Bernicia and Deira were consolidated into one state; when the British titles of its provinces, as comprising the Anglian conquests north of the Humber, merged into that of the kingdom of Northumbria.* Rhine, a body of the East Angles, sailing from England, ascended that river, ravaged the country and defeated the army of the Varni ; and making their king captive, obliged him to wed the princess, whose be trothed hand he had previously rejected.* It was from Deira that a colony of the invaders first penetrated into the central parts of the island, and by repeated con quests over the Britons laid the founda tion of a fourth Anglian kingdom, that of Mercia, which was gradually extended from the Humber to the Thames, and from the frontiers of East Anglia to the mountains of Wales. The Mercians, therefore, some of whom from their position acquired the name of Middle Angles, occupied Lincolnshire, Cheshire, and almost all the modern mid land counties, and formed the largest and most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon states except Wessex. But as the kingdom of Mercia was commenced the latest of the whole number, so its final establishment was the longest delayed. The expeditions of the Angles into the interior of the island were originally undertaken only by chief tains of inferior power or rank to the war kings, who had conducted the fleets of the invaders to the British shores ; and the resistance of the natives became probably the more obstinate as their numbers were compressed from all sides into the central provinces. The original conquests of the Middle Angles were considered, therefore, only as appendages to the kingdom of Deira; and although a chieftain named Cridda, one of their earliest leaders, is usually recorded as the first king of Mercia, and was at least the founder of its line of princes, it was not until the reign of his grandson, the fierce Penda, that this state was wholly emanci pated from the dominion of the Northern Angles.} Meanwhile, from its obscure commence ment, a new Anglian state had silently grown up and filled the whole intermediate parts of the eastern coast between Essex and Deira. Of the formation of this kingdom, which, from its position, acquired the name of East Anglia, and gradually embraced the modern counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge, little record is preserved: but Uffa, from whom his successors received the title of Uffingas, is mentioned as its first monarch; and of its power a remarkable proof has been deduced from the fact that, even while pursuing their conquests over the Britons, its warriors were sufficiently numerous to afford a large detachment for a foreign expedition.

One Jutish, three proper Saxon, and four Anglian states,* divided the pos session of the country, from the Frith of Forth to the Isle of Wight, and from the eastern coast to the foot of the Welsh moun tains and the neck of the Cornish peninsula. Yet, in the western parts of the island, five British states, or clusters of states, continued bravely to maintain an unyielding and vigor ous independence ; and in the extreme north the two wild and untamable nations of the Caledonians and Scots held secure possession of the eastern plains between the Friths of Forth and Moray, and of the whole high land tract of Scotland. The territory still retained by the Britons has been distin guished into the provinces of Strathclyde, or the region about the Clyde ; of Cumbria,} or Cumberland, shortly restricted to the modern Cumberland, and which was after wards incorporated with the kingdom of Bernicia; of North and South Wales, from the former of which the district of Chester was torn by the Angles early in the seventh century ; and, finally, of Cornwall, which, however, included great part of Devon, and was not reduced to the modern limits of the former county until a period long posterior to the epoch before us.} tion of these, crossing the channel, took possession of vacant tracts on the coast of Armorica, and by their successful settlement in that region of Gaul bestowed on the pro vince its modern appellation of Bretagne.* In the meagre annals of the Saxon con querors the slow and laborious progress of their arms is only obscurely delineated ; but by the chroniclers and bards of the British race, the long and certainly valiant resist ance of their countrymen has been pictured in the wildest colouring of romantic and poetical embellishment. From amidst the suspicious extravagance of such composi tions, it is not easy to extract the materials of sober and authentic history: but, with due caution, some degree of belief may be safely conceded to the reality of the gen eral circumstances which have formed the groundwork of these narrations. The tra ditionary renown and fabled achievements of more than one British chieftain may be received as evidence at least of his certain existence and distinguished share in the fierce struggle of the two races; and the chant of triumph or lamentation for the victorious or the fallen warrior, must be admitted in proof of the occurrence and general fortune of many a sanguinary en counter, of which we may be unable to ascertain either the exact locality or the date. In these last asylums of their rude free dom, the descendants of the Roman provin cials soon forgot the habits of an imperfect civilization ; and especially among the barren mountains and secluded fastnesses of Wales, the Britons gradually relapsed into a condi tion of positive barbarism. But besides the multitude of British warriors who, indignant at submission, had maintained their freedom without entirely abandoning their country, a number of other fugitives from the Saxons preferred exile to servitude ; \u00a7 and one por- Among all the British heroes,} the ro mantic exaggeration, rather of later times than of his own, has assigned a brilliant pre eminence to the name and actions of the famous Arthur. Yet neither the scenes of his dominion, nor the connection of his exploits, nor even the time at which he reigned and fell, can be explained with * See Usher, Antiquitates, p. 224-227, Gibbon, c. 88. f The last British chieftain whose name and lineage recall the association of the Roman dominion in the island is termed by Gildas, and others, Ambrosius Aurelianus. He is described as of Roman descent, and his parents are obscurely stated to have worn the imperial purple. (Gildas, c. 25.) He seems to have sought against Hengist ; but we know scarcely anything of his actions ; and he has sometimes been imagined the same person as Natanleod. Unusually perplexed by the contradic tions of chroniclers and antiquaries, Mr. Turner in one place (p. 253) opposes him (together with Arthur) ineffectually to Cerdic ; and just afterwards (p. 255) declares that, when that Saxon leader landed, Ambrosius \"had long been dead.\" * In this enumeration, Bede (p. 52) attributes a settlement on the Isle of Wight and parts of the Hampshire coast to bodies of Jutes, besides their general conquest of Kent. f The whole British territory of Strathclyde seems also, however, to have derived the general name of Cumbria from its possession by the Cymri or Britons.

France. At a still later epoch the Norman minstrels lent their attention with eager delight to the triumphs of the hero of their adopted country over their common enemy, the Saxons; and with the Welsh legends were incongruously interwoven the fables of classical poetry, the spirit of crusading enterprise, and the sentiments and manners of chivalry. In the romances of the Middle Ages the British chieftain became at once the descendant of Trojan princes, the vic torious champion of Christendom against the fierce infidels, and the perfect exemplar of knighthood. The fabulous deeds of Arthur and of his Knights of the Round Table were sung in every language, and received with implicit credit by every people of Europe ; and the universal belief which these tales once commanded is strangely con trasted with the modern scepticism which, by the last caprice of poetical fame, has in the land of his birth denied to their hero even the claim of a historical existence. satisfactory precision. The most probable conjectures make him the opponent of the West Saxons under their first two princes ;* and there are grounds for believing that he was also engaged against the Angles in the north. He is stated to have been victorious in twelve battles:} but since these many triumphs failed of a more decisive success than perhaps to retard the extension of the kingdom of Wessex,} they could scarcely have been all gained over the Anglo-Sax ons; and some of his wars seem to have been prosecuted, not against the invaders, but the rival princes of his own race. He is said finally to have perished in a civil feud or rebellion raised by his nephew; and was interred in the monastery of Glaston bury : where it is on good historical record \u00a7 that his remains, with an inscription, were discovered in the reign of Henry II.|| The memory of Arthur is chiefly indebted for the shadowy glory in which it is invested to the fancy of the Welsh bards and Nor man minstrels of subsequent ages; and, as it has been elegantly remarked,H the events of his life are less interesting than the sin gular revolutions of his fame. Among an imaginative race, who in their mountainous retreats fondly cherished the memory of the champions of their independence, the real exploits of Arthur were gradually magnified into a thousand forms of romance ; and for 500 years the traditions, on which every generation might raise some new superstruc ture of fiction, were carefully preserved and rudely adorned. From Wales and Corn wall the tales of Arthur were readily com municated to the Britons of kindred descent in Armorica; and from the latter province their popularity spread throughout Western It is certain, however, that in his own age the renown of Arthur was far eclipsed by Urien, another British prince, who long and gallantly resisted the progress of the invaders. The territory of Urien and the scene of his exploits lay in the more nor thern parts of the island ; and the Angles under Ida appear to have been his usual antagonists. It is the boast of his contem porary bard Taliesin that he gained several victories over the destroyers ; and the slow progress of Ida and his sons in the work of conquest attests the probability of this nar ration. But, like Arthur, Urien fell in a civil contest with his own countrymen ; and the common evidence of these facts is another proof of those divisions of the natives which entailed ruin upon their cause* At a somewhat later period, after the establishment of the Anglo-Saxon oct archy, a third British prince may be named as the last hero who vigorously sustained the sinking fortunes of his race, and held in suspense their final expatriation from the * Compare Gildas, c. 26, and Nennius, c. 61-63. f Nennius, ubi supra. } Gildas, ubi supra. \u00a7 Giraldus Cambrensis (apud Langhorn), p. 91.

This was Cad wallon, king of Gwynedd or North Wales, who availed himself of the dissensions of the Saxons to retaliate upon them some of the evils which had overtaken the Britons from their own feuds. In concert with Penda of Mercia, he invaded Northumbria, defeated and slaughtered the army of Edwin its sovereign, who fell in the battle, and ravaged the whole territory with frightful cruelty. So signal and continuous were the successes ofthe Welsh prince, that three Northumbrian kings lost their lives succes sively in the contest ; and he is declared by his bard to have been triumphant in four teen great battles and sixty skirmishes. But his course was at length arrested by a tremendous defeat, in which he perished with the majority of his followers.* With him expired the last rational hope of the restoration of the Britons to their pristine seats ; and though they still fondly cherished for ages the vain predictions of their bards, that they should one day expel the hated Saxon invaders from the island, the recovery of their ancient possessions never again be came probable. destruction. The recorded traces of devas tation which the island long afterwards presented, once suggested the now exploded opinion that the great mass of the British population in the provinces of the octarchy had been entirely exterminated by the con querors. But so soon as the first blind fury of their cruelty or vengeance had subsided, the obvious dictates of their own interest would induce them to preserve the culti vators of the land which they had won, as well as the cattle and habitations which were required for their own use ; and by a proud and warlike race who, in the fresh ness of their spirit of roving adventure, disdained the patient occupations of indus try, the labour of captives was indispensable for obtaining the produce of the soil. Wherever the obstinate resistance of the natives did not provoke the savage passions of the victors, their lives were spared ; but it was only to convert them into the abso lute property of their masters ; and the Britons of both sexes and of every age and condition were divided, like their lands, their herds, and their movables, among the chieftains and warriors of the invading hosts. The long and valiant, though desultory and uncombined resistance of the Britons, as it was unsuccessful, had only aggravated the horrors of conquest. Wherever the Saxon arms prevailed, their course was attended by massacre and desolation. The stubborn defence of the natives, and the losses which they inflicted on their victors, often provoked an indiscriminate slaughter; and by the victorious and ruthless bar barians villages and cities were involved with their inhabitants in a common confla- In this state of bondage to the soil, not withstanding some mere verbal disputes of modern writers on the proper acceptation of the terms by which the classes of the Anglo-Saxon peasantry were distinguished, it is evident that the descendants of the conquered population, at the distance of four centuries, still remained ; and though it is indubitable that many of the indigent Saxons themselves were often reduced to sell themselves and their families into per petual servitude, yet the distinction expressly made, in some of the Saxon codes, between slaves of national and alien blood sufficiently attests the existence of a servile order in both races. It is among the most pleasing proofs of the benign influence which Chris tianity, even in an imperfect and corrupted form, exercised over the ferocious spirit of the barbarians, that after their conversion the liberation of slaves was frequent, and gration. As the original conquerors were pagans, their ferocity spared the ecclesias tical edifices and institutions still less than the civil establishments of the natives. The churches and monasteries were destroyed ; the clergy were often murdered ; and the religion and arts, the laws and language of the Britons, were overwhelmed in a general * Authentic details of these wars of Cadwallon are contained in Bede, lib. ii. c. 20, lib. iii. c. 1, 2.

The Saxon laws gradually encouraged the practice of manumission, restricted the sale and at length prohibited the exportation of slaves ;* and in the districts which were torn from the Britons after the kings of Wessex had become Christians, they extended to their Cornish a large share of the civil rights which were enjoyed by their Saxon sub jects.} It were therefore a task equally weari some and revolting to follow out either the progress of the international Saxon wars, or the fate of the petty dynasties which rose and fell with the fluctuations of victory ; and in a rapid and cursory survey of the state of the island during the remainder of the period embraced in this division of our subject, we shall confine our attention to the general progress of those circumstances, which reduced the number of the Anglo- Saxon states, and prepared their distant consolidation into a single powerful mon archy. The only relief which is afforded to the ferocious character of the Saxon annals during these ages, will be found in the gradual and successive introduction of Christianity into the several states of the octarchy, and in its slow but certain influ ence in mitigating the rudeness and cruelty of the Saxon manners, and ameliorating the political condition of their national society. But the history of their conversion to the religion of the gospel, which, imperfectly as it was effected, is illustrated by many incidents pleasing in themselves and de veloping the better capacities of the rude Saxon mind, will form the distinct subject ofthe following chapter. The settlement and conquest of Britain by the Saxon race, the division of pro vinces among various bands of the three principal invading tribes, the gradual for mation and localities of their independent states, the fate of the previous inhabitants whom they destroyed, expelled, or enslaved, and the progress of events through which the new population, language, and social constitution of our forefathers were per manently implanted in our island \u2014 have presented objects of sufficient attraction to deserve and require a minute and circum stantial relation. But after the secure establishment ofthe Anglo-Saxon octarchy, there is by no means the same temptation or necessity to pursue the confused and troubled annals of those eight petty king doms through their dark and bloody vicissitudes of disorder. Even before the invaders had perfected their successes over the Britons, they began to quarrel among themselves. The bonds of their common cause and national consanguinity were fiercely broken ; and in their perpetual wars with each other, they shed their kin dred blood as profusely and mercilessly as that of the general enemy. Their history thenceforward, until the union of their states under the hereditary supremacy of a single line of monarchs, is little more than a quick succession of crimes the most sanguinary and cruel, the most violent and treacherous. In the partial and uncertain light which is afforded us to discern the obscure and intricate course of such events. While we thus disclaim any intention of regularly pursuing the annals of the dynasties of the octarchy, as both perplex ing and unprofitable to the reader, some order may be thrown into our notice of the Anglo-Saxon affairs between the independ ent establishment and the consolidation of their kingdoms, by tracing the reigns of a few among the most powerful of the pro vincial sovereigns. This course is obviously suggested by a circumstance which has seemed to mark something like a principle of national confederation among the Saxon * Leges Sax.

Of the exact nature of this pre-eminence no particular intimation has descended to us. We know neither whether it was conceded by the voluntary suffrages of the other powers and states, or arbitrarily assumed and enforced by the ambition of the pre dominant king ; nor yet whether it was a mere title of honour, or more substantially attended by the prerogatives and duties of a paramount sovereignty.* But in the sup position which most limits the attributes of the Bretwaldas, the progressive condition of the octarchy may be appropriately illustrated in the order, first of their ascendancy, and afterwards of that of other princes who, without being distinguished by the same specific title, appear to have succeeded to the greatest measure of dominion over the island. seen, he extended the limits of his own kingdom, were preceded by the first war among the Saxons themselves. The contest appears to have been provoked by the youthful ambition of Ethelbert, fourth king of Kent, who, prevented from enlarging his patrimonial state at the expense of the common enemy by the interposition of other Saxon territories, endeavoured to seize a portion of Wessex. But his presumptuous invasion of the dominions of Ceawlin was chastised by a severe defeat at Wimbledon, in which two of his ealdormen or earls were slain, with the flower of his army ; and the victory of the king of Wessex threatened the Kentish Jutes with the subjugation which they had endeavoured to impose on others.* We are not informed whether it was the moderation or policy of Ceawlin which induced him to respect the weakness of Kent, and to divert his arms against the Britons ; but at a subsequent period in his triumphant reign his ambition led him, on the death of the second king of Sussex, to add that little state to his conquests. The conclusion of his life was unfortunate. His nephew Ceolric having rebelliously allied himself with the Britons, defeated him in a great battle at Wodnesbeorg, or the mount of Woden, in Wiltshire; and this disastrous event was soon followed by the death of the Bretwalda, and the accession of his treach erous kinsman to the throne of Wessex.} The first Saxon prince to whom we find the dignity of Bretwalda attributed was Ella, the founder of the kingdom of Sus sex.} As that state was the smallest and least powerful of the whole number, it has been conjectured, with great probability, that this superiority may have been con ceded to some pre-eminence which Ella had enjoyed in his native country, or to some exploits of which the memory has perished.} The second prince who attained the same distinction was Ceawlin of Wes sex, grandson of Cerdic. The victories over the Britons by which, as we have The intestine disorders of that state probably averted the subjugation of Kent, and enabled Ethelbert to redeem the dis- grace of his early years. For by some unexplained course of prudence or fortune, he so extended his influence or power that, after the death of Ceawlin, he assumed the title of Bretwalda, and obtained a recog nition of his pre-eminence among all the Saxon states south of the Humber. The happiness of his reign was protracted to the long term of fifty-six years; and his con version to Christianity was followed by his promulgation of the earliest code of Anglo- Saxon legislation. During the life of Ethel- \u2022 Our only illustration on the dignity and succession of the Bretwaldas is derived from Bede, and, after the venerable historian, from the Saxon Chronicle. But neither authority has much extended our knowledge beyond the mere verbal signification of the word. Gibbon (c. 38, note 131) considers the reign of the Bretwaldas the effect, not of law, but of con quest; and Dr. Lingard (vol. i. p. 106) thinks it \" not rash to infer, from the strong expressions of Bede, that the inferior kings acknowledged themselves their vassals.\" Yet conquest at least cannot always be inferred from the possession of the dignity; since Ella, the first to whom it is assigned, is not declared to have subjugated Kent or Wessex ; nor were later Bretwaldas always the conquerors of other Saxon kingdoms. f Bede, lib. ii. c. 5.

Re flecting on the invariable successes and dreading the power of the Bernician tyrant, the East Anglian wavered between the duty of fulfilling his promise to the exile, and the danger of encountering the threat ened hostility of his persecutor. At this crisis of his fate Edwin was sitting alone, at the close of daylight, before the gate of the palace, when his melancholy suspense was broken by the voice of a friend, which whispered in his ear that it was time to rise and be away, for that the king had yielded to the demands of his enemy. \" And whither,\" said the young exile, \" should I flee ? I have already wandered, without finding a shelter, through all the provinces of the island : I have here received a pledge of safety; Redwald as yet has done me no evil, and I will not be the first to break the pledge of fidelity. I have long been too familiar with misery to be eager for life. If I am to perish, the shame of my death will not be mine, but my betrayer's ; and no death can be more welcome than that which is the work of royal perfidy.\" He remained seated on the same spot, filled with the sadness of his condition, until the shades of night had fallen around him : when an un known form seemed to rise up before him, in his troubled slumbers as we may believe, and promised him present deliverance and future greatness if he would listen to that which should hereafter be taught him. The vision, laying a hand upon his head, bade him remember that sign, and disap peared;* and Edwin, awaking with this gleam of hope, found his friend a second time by his side with an assurance of safety. The doubtful fidelity of Redwald had been confirmed by the noble sentiment of his queen, that a king should not sell a dis tressed friend, nor violate his faith for gold, for that no wealth was so precious and royal as good faith. As soon as Redwald bert the kingdom of Bernicia was engaged in a furious warfare with the Strathclyde or Scottish Britons ; and in a memorable battle the Anglian sovereign Ethelfrith defeated them with so great slaughter that, during more than a whole century afterwards, they never ventured to approach the Northum brian frontiers.* The death of Ethelbert terminated the ascendancy of his little kingdom; and the supremacy among the Anglo-Saxon estates was assumed by the most powerful and numerous of the three nations. The throne of East Anglia was filled at this juncture by Redwald, the third prince of the line of Uffa, who is styled the fourth of the Bretwaldas. A signal victory which he obtained over Ethelfrith of Bernicia, in the same year with the decease of Ethelbert, appears to have raised him to the pre eminence denoted by that title. After his triumph over the Strathclyde Britons, the warlike sovereign of Bernicia had been stimulated by successful ambition to seize the dominions of his young brother-in-law, Edwin of Deira; and the ejected prince had found refuge at the court of Redwald. The adventures of the fugitive, as they are told by the father of English history, form an episode which, amidst the gloomy scenes of the Saxon annals, interests alike by the simplicity and minuteness of the narrative and its illustration of the manners and feel ings of the age. It was aster having been driven from a first asylum in Gwynedd, or North Wales, where he had been generously educated by Cadvan, the British king, and after having wandered in secret through several of the Saxon states to escape the indefatigable pursuit of his usurping enemy, that Edwin, arriving at the East Anglian court, avowed his rank, and implored the hospitality of Redwald. He was kindly received by that monarch and his queen, and cheered with assurances of protection : but Ethelfrith no sooner heard of his resi dence at the East Anglian court than he sent repeated messengers to Redwald, first * The use which was made of this vision or dream, in the subsequent conversion of Edwin to Christianity, will be found noticed in the next chapter. * Bede, lib. i. c. 34.

On the banks of the little river Idel, in Nottinghamshire, he encountered his adversary, who was already on the march with a small body of chosen troops to surprise him. Notwithstanding the dis parity of numbers, the ancient fortune and experienced skill of Ethelfrith at first supported him ; and the vanguard of the three divisions in which the East Anglian army had been arrayed was entirely de- stroyed, and its leader, a son of Redwald, was slain. But the despair of the father, and the courageous conduct of Edwin himself, inspired firmness into the other East Anglian divisions, and retrieved the first disaster of the combat. In an im- base attempt of their sovereign Cwichhelm, who was envious of his rising fortunes, to procure his assassination. The agent selected for this atrocity, who was invested by Cwichhelm with the office of an am bassador, watched his opportunity during an audience to aim a dagger at the heart of Edwin. Lilla, a faithful thane, or nobleman, with the quick glance of affection saw the danger of the king only in time to throw himself before the person of his master, and to receive the blow which it was too late to avert. The stroke was so violent that Edwin was himself slightly wounded through the body of his devoted attendant : but the murderer was immediately over powered by numbers and killed, though not before, in the desperation of his struggle, he had slain a second nobleman in the assembly with the same weapon which had pierced the heart of Lilla. Edwin took a signal vengeance for the foul treachery of Cwichhelm by invading his dominions, and inflicting so severe a defeat upon the West Saxons that five of their chieftains were slain in the battle, and their country was pillaged by the victors (626). petuous onset Ethelfrith was slain ; his followers were easily destroyed or put to flight; and Redwald not only restored his young friend to the throne of Deira, but enabled him to subject Bernicia to his sceptre. The East Anglian king returned in triumph to his own dominions, and maintained until his death the prominent station of Bretwalda, to which his victory, notwithstanding his generous relinquish ment of its fruits, had deservedly raised him.* We are not clearly informed of the pro vocation which induced Edwin to undertake his subsequent wars against Cadwallon, king of North Wales : but the British prince is said to have been the aggressor by the invasion of the Northumbrian dominions. As Cadwallon, however, was the son of that Cadvan who had given an asylum to the early youth of Edwin, the circum stances of the contest may suggest a suspi cion that the Bretwalda was less sensible to the impulse of gratitude than of ambition. After repelling the invasion of Cadwallon, Edwin became in turn the assailant, pene trated into the heart of North Wales, conquered great part of the country, and obliged the British prince to seek refuge in Ireland (628). Pursuing his advantage, he reduced the islands of Anglesey and Man, and extended his sway far beyond that of any preceding Bretwalda, as well over the Saxon as the British states. As a symbol . On the death of his benefactor, Edwin, already sovereign of the two kingdoms north of the Humber, assumed the title of Bret walda (623). The rise of the Northumbrian power may be dated from the previous reign of the warlike Ethelfrith ; and it was still further advanced by the activity and talents of Edwin. In a series of successful wars he established his superiority over the Saxons of Wessex and the Britons of North Wales, while he maintained the relations of an amicable supremacy with the successors of Redwald in East Anglia. His attack upon the West Saxons was caused by a Eede lib. ii. c. 12. See also Chron. Sax. p. 27. 4"], [64, "[a.d. 449-800. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 26 Saxon and Briton, the similarity of their views formed a sufficient bond of alliance and revolt ; and Penda and Cadwallon, unit ing their forces, encountered those of Edwin in a great battle at Hatfield, in Yorkshire (633). The issue of that conflict proved fatal, as we have already seen, to the empire and life of Edwin, and gave a decided superiority over all the Anglo-Saxon states to the cruel Penda, who appears now first to have assumed the royal title in Mercia* of his supremacy, he introduced a pageantry unknown to his rude countrymen ; and whenever he appeared in public the Tufa, or Roman standard of empire, was always borne before him. It is a more honourable evidence of his power, and of the spirit in which it was administered, that the memory of his vigilant justice was long preserved; and the excellence of the internal police which he established in that age of violence is pointedly attested by a current proverb of the succeeding generation, that \" in the days of Edwin a woman with the babe at her breast might walk from sea to sea without fear of injury or insult.\" He caused reservoirs of stone to be fixed at convenient distances, on all the highways through his dominions, to collect the waters of the nearest springs, and chained to them vessels of brass, for the refreshment of travellers. In a state of society in which no places of entertainment were provided for wayfarers, this considerate provision, suggested to Edwin, perhaps, by his own early experience of fatigue and privations in his wanderings, was gratefully received by his people; and such were the lawless habits of the times as to make it thought worthy of note, that dread of the king's searching justice, or respect for his benevo lence, restrained all men from the theft of these cups. * Though this prince is not numbered by the Saxon writers among the Bretwaldas, the pre-eminence of his power renders him in effect the most conspicuous among the contemporary sovereigns of the island; and the circumstances of his reign will best illustrate the general annals of all Britain. After the victory of Hatfield, the inoffensive tranquillity of East Anglia next tempted his spirit of cruel aggression. Sigebert, the king of that state, actuated by the mis taken piety of the times, which preferred the devotional retirement of the cloister to the active duties of life, had assumed the tonsure, and resigned the throne to his cousin Ecgric : but his people, on the alarm of Penda's invasion, distrusting the abilities of his successor, drew him by entreaty or force from his monastery, and insisted on his assuming the command of their army. Sigebert reluctantly yielded : but refusing to bear arms, as repugnant to his religious profession, he would assume no other em blem of command than a wand. His mili tary skill was exceeded by the veteran ability of Penda, and both the royal monk and the reigning prince of the East Angles perished on the same disastrous field. A second Bretwalda, in the person of another Northumbrian king, was soon after added to the number of the victims whom Penda immolated to his fierce ambition. This was Oswald, the conqueror of Cadwallon, who, probably from his success against the Welsh prince, had assumed the supreme title, and further justified his claim to it no less by his pacific virtues than by his Notwithstanding the greatness and vir tuous reputation of Edwin, his reign ter minated calamitously. Under the vigorous and able administration of Penda, the grand son of Cridda, a ferocious and warlike chieftain, the extensive province of Mercia, which until that period had remained sub ordinate to the dominion of the Northern Angles, attained sufficient strength for the assertion of independence. Penda, now advanced in years, had long endured with impatience the supremacy of the Northum brian king, when his aid was besought by the British sovereign of North Wales in an attempt to throw off the same yoke. Not withstanding the national hatred between \u2022 Bede, lib. ii. c. 5-16. Chron. Sax. p. 27. * Bede, lib. ii. c. 20. Chron.

But in the eighth year of his reign he was attacked by Penda, and shared the fate of Edwin. The savage victor, after mutilating the dead body of his adversary, and spreading devastation through Northumbria, laid siege to its capital Bebbanburh, or Bamborough. But the strength of that place, situated on a rocky promontory of the German Ocean, defied his assaults, and he resolved to de stroy it by fire. For that purpose, demol ishing the villages in its neighbourhood, he piled all their combustible materials up near the walls of the city; and so soon as the wind set strongly towards the place, the whole mass was inflamed. The appalled inhabitants were already oppressed by volumes of smoke, and expecting the destruction of their walls from the progress of the fire, when the wind, suddenly shifting, turned the conflagration upon its authors, and the panic-stricken Mercians abandoned the siege (642).* objects of his fury. It was in vain that Oswy, the brother and successor of Oswald, strove, by the tender of submission and tribute, to deprecate his enmity. Penda had sworn to exterminate the whole nation of the Northumbrians ; and in his last invasion of their country no fewer than thirty vassal kings and chieftains of the Saxon and British race swelled with their followers the multitude of his forces. But Oswy and his people were urged by despair to oppose the most vigorous resistance ; and notwithstanding their inferiority in numbers and martial equipment, they so totally de feated the army ofthe hoary tyrant, that only two of the thirty vassal princes who fought under his standard escaped with life, and Penda himself, being hurried off the field in the general rout, was overtaken and put to death. The battle was fought at Win widfield in Yorkshire ; and the waters of the Aire, which had overflowed its banks, swept away a greater number of the Mer cians in their flight than had perished in the conflict. Though perpetrated in an age so familiar with horrors, the surpassing crimes of Penda were deemed to have pro voked the retributive justice of his fate ; and the natural sentiment of the people was expressed and preserved in a proverbial saying, that in Winwid's stream were avenged the deaths of the three East Ang lian and the two Northumbrian kings, whose blood had been shed by the Pagan tyrant (654).* After the retreat of Penda from Bam borough, the subjugation of Wessex was the next enterprise which engaged his vin dictive and insatiable ambition. Cenwalch, the sovereign of that state, had incurred his resentment by repudiating his sister. The arms of Penda were as usual victorious, and the West Saxon king was expelled from his dominions (643). He sought an asylum in East Anglia ; and the hospi tality which he received from its sovereign afforded the ferocious Mercian a pretext for fresh aggression upon that kingdom. The country of the East Angles was again invaded, their army was routed, and a third of their monarchs perished by the sword of Penda. Though he had already reached the age of eighty years, the spirit of that ruler was still as active and san guinary as ever ; and nothing less than the total destruction of every opponent could now satisfy his pride and cupidity. The Northern Angles continued the peculiar The fall of Penda, and the destruction of his army, opened a field for the elevation of Oswy to the dignity and power of Bret walda. Both Mercia and East Anglia, whose strength had been exhausted in the struggle with Penda, lay prostrate before the victorious arms of the Northumbrian ; and annexing the former province to his own dominions, he established his superi ority over all the other Saxon states. The Welsh and Scottish princes also are said to have become his tributaries ; and for a season he vigorously maintained the * Bede, lib. iii. c 17-24. Chron. Sax. p. 33. Bede, lib. iii. c. 1-IG.

Yet in the latter years of his reign his power was considerably diminished. Under Cenwalch, so soon as that prince was relieved from the oppression of Penda, Wessex began to emerge into activity and vigour ; and some Mercian nobles, revolting against the Bretwalda, succeeded in recovering the independence of their country, and placed on its throne Wulf here, the youngest son of Penda, whom, amidst the ruin of his house, they had diligently concealed from the search of the conqueror. Under Wulfhere, the kings of Sussex and Essex courted the friendship and declared themselves the dependent allies of Mercia; and the recover ing power both of that state and of Wessex began to contend with Northumbria for superiority. Oswy, however, died in peace ; and with him expired the title and the supremacy of the Bretwaldas (670).* On the death of Oswy the crown of Northumbria passed to his son Ecgfrid, who during his reign, but without the supreme title, endeavoured, on the whole not unsuccessfully, to maintain the predo minance of his state over the other Saxon kingdoms. His most powerful competitor was Wulfhere of Mercia ; but he defeated that monarch, and on his death even took possession for a time of his dominions, which he, however, shortly restored to Ethelred, the surviving son of Penda, who had married his sister. Subsequently, not withstanding this alliance, a war arose between Ecgfrid and Ethelred, which, after a bloody and dubious conflict on the Trent, was terminated by the mediation of Theo dore, archbishop of Canterbury (679). But the principal triumphs and the final disaster of Ecgfrid's reign, were achieved and suf fered in his wars against the Caledonian Britons. That people, soon after his acces sion, took advantage of his youth to assert their independence ; but he attacked them with vigour so unexpected, and routed their army with so great slaughter, that he com pelled them to resume their submission to the Northumbrian crown. At a later period he carried his arms into Ireland, then dis tinguished for the peaceful character of its people, and even for the superior learning and virtues of its monastic teachers (684). Though the inoffensive natives do not appear to have given him any provocation, Ecgfrid, in the cruel wantonness of ambition, resolved upon their subjugation, and under his gene ral Beorht despatched across the channel an army, which, though prevented by the brave resistance of the invaded from effect ing the purpose of conquest, miserably ravaged their coasts, and burned many of The successive assumption of that dignity by one South Saxon, one West Saxon, one Kentish, one East Anglian, and three Northumbrian kings, may serve to illustrate the relative importance or influence which the states of the Octarchy had at different periods hitherto enjoyed. But if, upon this estimate, Northumbria had latterly acquired the decided predominance, the superiority had gradually been declining during the last years of Oswy, and after his death it was never recovered. The greater natural strength of Mercia, which had been devel oped under the energetic though cruel sway of Penda, was matured by the prudent administration of his son ; and Wessex, by the slow but certain progress of its arms against the Britons, had incorporated almost all the southern and south-western parts of the island into its territory. The remain ing states, Sussex, Kent, Essex, and East Anglia, were each singly unequal to a con test with their more powerful neighbours, and figured only as the allies, or more generally as the subjects, of Wessex, Mercia, and Northumbria. From that time, there- P.ede, lib. iii. c. 25 ad fin.; iv ad c. 11. Chron. Sax. pp. 34-10."], [67, "A.D. 449-800.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 29 their towns with the churches and monas teries. Their wrongs were speedily avenged in the fate of Ecgfrid ; for in the following year, impelled by the same restless spirit of aggression, he rashly led his followers into the territory of the Caledonians, and being inveigled into the fastnesses of their nor thern mountains, he was cut off\", with nearly all his army, in a bloody engagement at Dunnechtan (685). The body of Ecgfrid was found among the slain, and received an honourable interment from the victors in their royal cemetery, in the celebrated Isle of Icolmkill, or Saint Columba. The dis astrous issue of this expedition encouraged the Welsh, as well as the Scottish Britons, to throw off the yoke of Northumbria ; and under the reign of Aldfrid, the successor of Ecgfrid, a second defeat, in a similar invasion intrusted to Beorht, in which the Northumbrian leader also perished with his army, still further broke the power of that state. Aldfrid, a pacific prince, distinguished among his contemporaries for his piety and learning, did not attempt to preserve the supremacy among the Saxon kingdoms which his predecessors had asserted, but contented himself with governing his con tracted dominions in the enjoyment of the universal respect which was accorded to his virtues, both by his own people and the adjacent states.* die, was first banished from Wessex, and subsequently raised to its throne. His abilities and fortune, in peace and in war, enabled him not only to maintain that dignity over his own subjects, but to estab lish his superiority over the kingdoms of Sussex and Kent. His victorious career was sullied by frightful cruelties ; and it was probably the impulse of a repentant conscience which induced him, before he had reached the age of thirty years, to abandon his dominions and proceed on a pilgrimage to Rome, to receive the rite of baptism from the hands of the pope. He died very soon after his arrival in the holy city ; but his example was followed in course of a few years by two other Anglo-Saxon kings, Cenred of Mercia and Offa of Essex, who, travelling also to Rome, there assumed the monastic profession, and died (688).* The death of Ceadwalla was followed in Wessex by the long reign of Ina. He was lineally descended from Cerdic ; but the irregularity which prevailed in the order of royal succession among the Anglo-Saxons is evinced in the example of his election to the throne while his own father and two children of the late king were living. His elevation, however, justified the national choice ; for the martial abilities and achieve ments of Ina were not inferior to those of the most distinguished of his predecessors ; and it was his victorious career which con firmed the increasing power of Wessex. By his successive conquests over the Cornish Britons he added a considerable territory to his kingdom ; by some unrecorded means he acquired the paramount sovereignty of Essex ; and after an obstinate struggle of the people of Sussex to recover their inde pendence, he finally annexed that state to the crown of Wessex. A war in which he engaged with Ceolred, king of Mercia, pro duced no other fruits than a sanguinary and indecisive battle at Wodnesbeorg (710) ; but he had previously reduced the less power ful state of Kent into complete subjection to his arms. The name of Ina, however, is The same year in which Ecgfrid perished was marked by the rise in Wessex of Cead walla, who became the most distinguished Saxon prince of his times. The failure of issue in the direct royal fine after the death of Cenwalch , had reduced the kingdom of the West Saxons to the condition of a turbulent aristocracy ; in which many chieftains of the race of Cerdic alternately contended with each other for the ascendancy, and conferred the royal title on one of their number for the exigencies of common de fence against foreign enemies. In the vicissitudes of faction produced by this disorderly form of government, the young Ceadwalla, himself a descendant from Cer- * Bede, lib. iv. c. 15 ; lib. v. c. 7 Chron.

After giving a sumptuous banquet to their nobles and clergy at a country palace, the royal pair departed on a journey ; but having travelled a short distance, Ina was induced, by the earnest entreaty of the queen, to retrace their way. As he again approached the scene of recent festivity, the king was astonished at the silence and desolation which seemed to pervade it. His amazement increased when, on entering the banqueting chamber, he found its regal garniture vanished, the apartment over spread with filth and rubbish, and the very couch on which he had reposed occupied by a litter of swine. While he yet gazed in silent disgust on the change, his queen confessed that it had been prepared by her command : \u2014 \" My lord and husband, behold how shortly may all appliances of human grandeur be converted to the vilest uses ! Here are no longer the voices of revellers and parasites, the glitter of silver vessels, or the allurement of exquisite viands. All these are gone like the wind and the smoke, and shall not our enjoyment of such toys soon be as vain and fleeting? See, I be seech you, how disgusting is the transfor mation in these objects of our solicitude. To still more loathsome changes must our own pampered bodies submit. Unhappy then must we be if their indulgence absorb our minds. Ah ! let us not cling to these corrupting vanities, but seek rather the things of eternity!\"* But history has suggested some other, and it may be better authenticated, explanations of the retire ment of Ina from the throne.} His frame was oppressed by infirmities, and his mind distracted with the cares of government. The peace of his old age was broken by rebellions ; and experience had taught him the difficulty of curbing with an enfeebled hand the restless spirit of a factious and warlike nobility. He perhaps resolved to descend voluntarily from a station which chiefly indebted for its fame to his efforts as a legislator ; and the collection of his laws, which yet survives, avouches his best title to remembrance. In the fifth year of his reign, at a witenagemote, or assembly of the National Council of Wessex, and \" with the advice,\" as it is simply expressed in the exordium to his code, \" of his father Cenred, his bishops Hedda and Erconwold, and of all his ealdormen, the oldest sages of his people, and a great collection of God's servants,\" he collected or enacted these laws, in number seventy-nine.* In such an attempt to reduce the customary and oral rules of judgment, during a rude con dition of society, into a series of written jurisprudence, we are not, of course, to expect any approach to a perfect system of legislation ; but the code of Ina entitled him to the gratitude of his people, and its purpose may command the respect even of more enlightened ages. It determined the scale of those pecuniary compensations for crimes which were, perhaps, the only restraint upon violence which the fierce spirit of the times would endure ; by punishing robberies and frauds which ruined industry, and obstructed the fair inter change of property, it attempted to give security to the trader and the cultivator ; and it extended the protection of humanity in some measure even to the domestic bondsman and the serf of the soil.} As the laws of Ina mark some of the first advances of the Saxon mind in the work of social order, so the traditionary account which has descended to us of the last scene of his lengthened and prosperous reign, may at least serve to exemplify the tone of religious and philosophical senti ment which belonged to the same age. In his declining years the consort of Ina had often vainly besought him to withdraw with her from the world, and to exchange the cares of royalty for the retirement of the cloister. As her eloquence sailed to wean the aged monarch from the habitual passion for regal state, she had recourse * William of Malmesbury, p. 15. t Lingard, vol. i. p. 198. * Wilkins, Leges Sax. p. 14. f Ibid. pp. 14-27."], [69, "A.d. 449-800.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 31 he could no longer retain with dignity, and the customs of the times regulated the subsequent purpose of his piety. Havino solemnly resigned the crown in a witena gemote, he soon after travelled on pilgrimage with his queen to Rome, where both sought a voluntary obscurity, and died in their self inflicted condition of poverty (728).* their deepening contest for the sovereignty of the Anglo-Saxon nation.* Against the ascendancy, however, which the warlike ability and the fortune of Ethel bald had acquired, the contemporary princes of Wessex for some time ineffectually struggled. \u00c6thelheard, who had finally prevailed over a competitor after the death of Ina, and had become the vassal of the Mercian, made a vain effort to throw off his yoke, and was punished with the loss of Somerton, then the chief place in Somerset shire. His brother Cuthred, who succeeded him eight years later, was compelled to serve Ethelbald in his wars against the Welsh; and the united army of the Anglo-Saxons inflicted a severe defeat upon that people, and devastated their country in several ex peditions. At length Cuthred, a prince of more vigorous character than his late brother, who bore with impatience the exactions of his tyrant, resolved to emancipate himself and his country from the Mercian supremacy, and encountered Ethelbald on the field of Burford in Oxfordshire (752). The circumstances of this great and obstinate battle have been depicted by an ancient chronicler with un usual spirit and vividness of colouring. In the insolence of confident power, the Mer cians fought for dominion and plunder; with the courage of desperation, the West Saxons struggled to escape the worst horrors of subjection. The national standards of the people were directly opposed in the van of either army, and the thickest and fiercest of the fight soon gathered round them. In the onset a gallant ealdorman, Edelhun, once a rebel, but now the most faithful sub ject of Cuthred, who bore the golden dragon, the banner of Wessex, slew with his own hand the standard-bearer of Ethelbald. The West Saxons hailed the deed of their cham pion with shouts of exultation as the sure presage of victory; the Mercians rushed for ward to rescue their standard, and the hos tile lines closed in one general and furious death struggle. The murderous conflict with the sword, the spear, and the ponderous The abdication of Ina was followed by the disorders of a disputed succession, which for a time impaired the power of Wessex, and placed that of her rival state in the ascendant. The sceptre of Mercia was at that epoch held by Ethelbald, an able and active prince, who soon took advantage of the intestine divi- sions of the West Saxons to assert the supe- riority of his throne over all those portions of the island which lie between the Humber and the Southern Channel. He seems to have been the first monarch since the Bret- waldas who arrogated to himself the univer- sal sovereignty ofthe Anglo-Saxons; for in his charters he assumed the title of \"King of Britain, and King not only of Mercia, but of all the provinces which are known under the general South Anglian name;\" or in other words, of all England, unless it should be thought that Northumbria was designedly excepted by the phrase. That kingdom was governed, during great part of the southern reign of Ethelbald, by Eadbert, whose suc- cessive victories over the Caledonians and Strathclyde Britons enlarged his dominions, and revived the glory of the Northumbrian name. The Mercian king in general re- spected the power of Eadbert, or, at least, it was only during his absence in the Scottish wars that Ethelbald ventured to attack his dominions ; and the issue of those predatory invasions redounded little to the honour of the aggressor. After a brilliant reign of twenty-one years Eadbert imitated the ex- ample which so many Anglo-Saxon princes had already offered, of retiring into a monas- tery; and from that event may be dated the rapid and final decline of the Northumbrian power (758). Henceforth Mercia and Wes sex were left without a third rival to share * Bede, lib. v. c. 7. Chron. Sax. pp. 48-52. Bede, lib v. c. ult. Chron. Sax. pp. 51-59."], [70, "[a.d. 449-800. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 32 had collected, in the forest near Winchester, the king one afternoon left that royal resi dence but slightly attended, to visit a lady to whom he was attached at Merton, in Surrey. The conspirators secretly followed his train ; and aster his attendants were dis missed for the night to some neighbouring houses, surrounded that to which he had retired, and broke in upon his unguarded slumbers. The royal victim, roused by their intrusion, seized his sword, and rushing upon their leader, whom he recognized, severely wounded him; but he was overpowered by numbers and slain before his attendants, awakened by the clash of weapons and the shrieks of his mistress, could arrive to his assistance. The conspirators offered safety to the royal servants, and even tempted them, few as they were, by bribes to be gone in peace ; but personal fidelity to a lord was a principle of honourable obligation already deemed as sacred among the Anglo-Saxons as in the feudal relations of later times, and the faithful followers of the king, rejecting all compromise, fiercely assailed his mur derers, and continued the generous but unavailing conflict until they fell to a man beside their master's body. Even a Briton in their company, who had been detained as a hostage at the Saxon court, fought by their side until he was desperately wounded, and was indebted for his life to the forbear ance of the conspirators. The tidings of this dismal tragedy had no sooner reached Winchester than the thanes of the royal household assembled their retainers, and took horse for Merton, where the conspira tors had hastily fortified themselves. Cyne heard met the new comers in parley at the barrier, dwelt upon the family wrongs which had roused him to vengeance, asserted his own claim to the crown which his brother had worn, offered munificently to purchase their assistance in obtaining it, and reminded them that many of his band were their kins men. The royal thanes indignantly spurned the proposal ; declaring that their murdered lord was not less dear to them than their kinsmen ; that if the latter wished to save battle axe \u2014 the last the most common wea pon of the Anglo-Saxon array \u2014 long hung in suspense, until the ealdorman Edelhun, who figures as the hero of the battle, con fronted the Mercian king. Each collected his full vigour for the collision ; but Ethel bald was overpowered by the gigantic stature and strength of the champion. Forgetful of his former fame, and preferring safety to glory, Ethelbald, the conqueror of many fields, gave to his yet struggling followers the first example of a precipitate flight, which produced the total rout of his army. This victory of the West Saxons destroyed for a time the supremacy of Mercia ; and five years later Ethelbald lost in battle against his own rebellious subjects the life which had been only ingloriously protracted by fleeing before his foreign enemies (757).* The death of Cuthred preceded that of his humbled rival, for he survived his vic tory of Burford only two years ; but in that interval he undertook another successful expedition against the Britons, and annexed to his dominions a fresh district torn from the Welsh frontiers. His successor, Sige byrht, after a brief and tyrannical reign, was deposed and murdered ; and the West Saxon nobles elected in his place Cynewulf, a descendant of Cerdic, in whose long reign of twenty-nine years there is nothing better worthy of record than his defeat in a contest with Mercia, which terminated disgracefully by the surrender of the West Saxon terri tory on the northern bank of the Thames. The circumstances, however, which attended the death of Cynewulf throw too curious a light upon some qualities of the Anglo- Saxon character to be passed over in silence. Cyneheard, brother of the last king, having been driven into exile by the jealousy of the reigning prince, had secretly returned to Wessex, still brooding over long-cherished desires of revenge, when the incautious security of Cynewulf gave him an opportu nity of putting them into execution. While Cyneheard lay concealed, with a devoted band of about eighty adherents, whom he * Chron. Sax. p. 51-56. Huntingdon, p. 311."], [71, "a.d. 449-800.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 33 their lives they were free to depart, but that on Cyneheard and the rest of his band ven geance should be done. The kinsmen of the royal thanes, in their turn, refused to obtain the proffered safety by desertion of their lord; the same boon, they said, had been rejected but yester-even by the king's train, and it should that morn be seen that Cyneheard had followers not less generous in their devotion. The impatient assailants waited no further question to commence a furious onset; the barrier was hewn down by their battle-axes, the conspirators de fended themselves with desperation, and the struggle ceased only with the fall of the last of the guilty band. Among the heap of his slaughtered companions which covered the dead body of Cyneheard, one youth only was found to breathe. He was the godson of the ealdorman Osric, who had led the assailants, and reverence for that sacred tie preserved his solitary life.* permanent conquests from the Welsh. After some vicissitudes of fortune he finally ex pelled that people from all their possessions between the Severn and the Wye, filled the intermediate country with Anglo-Saxon colonies, and effectually repressed the fierce incursions of the mountaineers upon the new settlers by drawing a ditch and rampart from the mouth of the latter river to the estuary of the Dee. This gigantic work, which was long celebrated under the name of \" Claudh Offa,\" or \" Offa's Dyke,\" and of which some traces remain to this hour, was carried through marshes and rivers and over mountains for a distance of above a hundred miles ; and it served in subsequent ages for the boundary which determined the confines of England and Wales (780).* The predominant power of Offa may be determined by the eagerness of the other Anglo-Saxon princes of the period to court his alliance. One of his daughters, Elfleda, was married to Ethelred, king of Northum- bria, whom he had compelled by the terror of his arms to acknowledge his supremacy. Another, Eadburga, was united to Beorhtric, the successor of Cynewulf on the throne of Wessex. The overture of a third royal suitor for the hand of his remaining daughter, Etheldritha, was followed by an act of hor- rible treachery, fatal alike to the life of the lover and the fame of Offa. Attended by a numerous retinue, Ethelbert, king of East Anglia, a youthful prince of handsome per- son, virtuous disposition, and excelling in all the accomplishments of the age, arrived on the Mercian frontiers to solicit Ethel- dritha for his bride. The announcement of the purpose of his journey was met by Offa with a warm invitation to proceed, and by solemn assurances of a safe and respectful reception. Thus encouraged, on his arrival at the court he was welcomed with the honours claimed by his rank, and the affec tionate attentions due to a favoured suitor. But on retiring to his chamber, after the festivity of a banquet, he was basely assassi- The undistinguished reign of Cynewulf in Wessex was eclipsed by the superior power of Offa of Mercia, who after an inter- val of anarchy, which followed the death of Ethelbald, had been raised to the throne of that kingdom (577). The original claims of Offa to the regal dignity were founded on his descent from a brother of Penda ; but his crown was laboriously won by the sword, and the first fourteen years of his reign were consumed in civil wars, during which he shed much blood and committed many atro- cious cruelties. His talents were, however, as eminent as his temper was sanguinary and his ambition unscrupulous; and he had no sooner established his authority in his own kingdom than his enterprises began to be formidable to the surrounding states. After having assailed and oppressed the feeble independence of Kent, he turned his arms against the more powerful kingdom of Wes- sex; and his defeat of Cynewulf at Bensing ton was followed, as already stated, by the cession to Mercia of all the territory north of the Thames (777). This triumph was only the prelude to still more important and * Chron. Sax. pp. 56-61. Asser, De Gestis Elfredi (Wise^ * Chron. Sax. pp. 59-63. Huntingdon, p. 3-13. p. 10. 5"], [72, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 449-S00. 34 nated. The ancient chroniclers differ in the share of this most foul and inhospitable murder which they attribute to Offa; but they are unanimous in assigning to his queen Cynedrida the original guilt of its suggestion. But the subsequent conduct of the Mercian king betrays the purpose of the crime, and stamps on his memory the full infamy of its accomplishment: he imme diately seized the East Anglian dominions, and annexed them to his own (792).* the pardon of some noble Anglian exiles, and was improved into the establishment of provisions for regulating the commerce of their dominions. In letters which are still extant Charlemagne terms Offa his dearest brother, and greets him with presents; but those friendly relations were interrupted by the very means employed to cement them. Charlemagne, in pledge of his amity, having offered his natural son, Charles, as a hus- band for one of the daughters of Offa, the Mercian king assented, upon condition of ob- taining a princess of the Carlovingian house for his legitimate heir, Ecgfrid. Though the Frankish monarch had hitherto addressed Offa as a prince of not inferior dignity to himself, his pride conceived such unreason- able offence at the assumption of equality implied in this counter-proposal, that he suddenly suspended all intercourse between his court and that of Mercia, and even for- bade altogether the importation into his dominions of the woollen gowns which already formed an article of English manu- facture. But his own subjects, as well as those of Offa, suffered so much inconvenience from the suspension of this traffic, that he soon allowed Alcuin to exercise his media tion successfully for the re-establishment of a friendly intercourse between the two governments.* With the natural and pious desire of marking the retributive justice of heaven, the chroniclers of the age before us have felt some satisfaction in tracing the punish ment of Offa's crimes by the calamities of his house. Of his three daughters, Elfleda was widowed by the murder of her husband ; Eadburga, expelled from the throne of Wes sex for her atrocities, died wretchedly in exile; and Etheldritha, the destined bride of the young Ethelbert, horror-stricken at his assassination, fled from her father's court to the abbey of Croyland, and there ended her days in mournful seclusion. Cynedrida, the evil counsellor of her husband's blood stained ambition, perished miserably; and Offa himself survived to possess his ill-gotten crown of East Anglia only two years, and then sank into the grave the victim of re morse and disease (794). His son Ecgfrid, who succeeded him, died childless after he had possessed the throne of Mercia only 141 days; and thus in a few years the race of Offa, whose elevation had been purchased at the expense of so much bloodshed and guilt, disappeared for ever.} The protection which the court of Charle magne meanwhile afforded to an illustrious Anglo-Saxon exile, led at a subsequent period to a closer intercourse between the predominant English state and the Frankish empire. Aster the tragical fate of Cynewulf, the nobles of Wessex, exerting their custom ary right of election, had raised Beorhtric, one of their order ofthe race of Cerdic, to the vacant throne (784). The elevation of the new king had been opposed, or his jealousy at least was excited, by the rival pretensions of Egbert, another scion of the same royal stock; and the youthful prince was com pelled to consult his safety by retiring, first to the Mercian, and afterwards to the Carlo- * Epistol\u00e6 Caroli Magni (apud Dom.

The reign of Offa is memorable, among other circumstances, for the opening of an amicable intercourse between the Anglo- Saxon states and the Carlovingian empire. It was that learned Englishman, Alcuin, the preceptor of Charlemagne, who seems to have originated an epistolary correspondence between his great pupil and the Mercian king. It commenced by the humane inter cession of Charlemagne with Offa to obtain * Chron. Sax. p. 65. Vita Off\u00e6 (apud Matthew Paris, ed. Watts), p. 23. t Vita Off\u00e6, pp. 24, 25.

By the great monarch of the Franks Egbert was received with kind ness; and the period of his exile at the most civilized and intellectual court of the times was beneficial to the enlargement of his mind, and the cultivation of his natural talents. He is said to have attended Charle magne in several of his military expeditions ; and the superior acquirements which he subsequently displayed in the arts of war and government, may reasonably be referred to the experience which he had gained in the service of his accomplished and power fid protector.* pating in the royal titles and prerogatives. Eadburga sought the usual refuge of the Carlovingian court, and laid splendid offer ings from her treasure before the throne of its monarch. In reply to a jesting inquiry from Charlemagne, whether she would wed him or his son, she declared her preference for the latter, because he was the younger. In real or affected displeasure, the king taunted her with the assurance that, if she had chosen differently, he would have trans ferred her to his son, but as it was, she should have neither. He assigned to her a station under the discipline of the cloister, which he perhaps deemed better fitted than a new marriage for the correction of her morals and the expiation of her guilt; and he endowed her with possession of a wealthy convent, with the title of abbess. But even in this retreat she continued to indulge her depravity, until the public scandal of her conduct compelled her ignominious expul sion. In her last years, aster many adven tures, she wandered into Italy, dragging on in squalid vice and poverty a miserable and loathsome existence; and accompanied only by a little girl, the daughter and widow of two Anglo-Saxon kings, she was reduced to beg her daily bread in rags through the streets of Pavia, where she terminated an abandoned life by a deplorable death.* Egbert seems, during the life of his enemy, to have made no effort to re-establish himself in his native land; and for sixteen years Beorhtric reigned undisturbed over Wessex. To conciliate the friendship of the formidable Offa, and to induce him to withdraw his protection from Egbert, the king of Wessex had solicited and obtained the hand of one of the daughters of the Mercian; and the alliance by which he thus sought to secure his throne became even tually the occasion of his destruction. His queen, Eadburga, was a woman of arrogant temper and vicious passions. With a spirit as ambitious and unprincipled as that of her father Offa, she acquired a complete ascen dancy over the more feeble mind of her husband, and subjected both himself and his kingdom to her despotic sway. Her jealousy of his partiality for a young noble man of the court, at last induced her to mingle a deadly potion for the favourite; and Beorhtric, accidentally partaking of the poisoned chalice, shared the same fate with the intended victim. The murderess eluded the vengeance with which her husband's sub jects would justly have visited her crimes, by a timely flight to the Continent with considerable treasures which she had accu mulated : but the witenagemote of Wessex, strangely extending to her whole sex the indignation provoked by her wickedness, enacted a law by which the future consorts of their kings were excluded from partici- By the decease of Beorhtric, Egbert had become the only surviving prince of the line of Cerdic, from whom he derived his origin through Inigils, the brother of Ina; and the hereditary attachment of the nobles and people of Wessex to the race of the victorious founder of their state was evinced by their unanimous recognition of the claim of his last descendant.} Egbert was imme diately recalled to his own country ; and his unopposed accession to the throne of Wessex introduces a new epoch in the Anglo-Saxon annals (800). The island was approaching a condition peculiarly favourable to the last ing predominance of a single power : it now presented in effect only a triarchy.

Essex, and East Anglia, had already per manently fallen under the virtual sovereignty of Mercia, whose western boundaries had been extended to the foot of the Welsh mountains ; but that state itself, which since the death of Offa and the extinction of his family had been ruled by the vigorous sceptre of Kenwulf, a collateral descendant from the family of Penda, was destined after his death, by its intestine disorders, to be come an easy prey to the better administered power of Wessex. That kingdom, which had already absorbed Sussex and the greater portion of the territory of the Cornish Bri tons, was sufficiently prepared, under the active and able pupil of Charlemagne, to overmatch its ancient rival. Neither in the north was any countervailing power left to check the West Saxon ascendancy. The remaining kingdom, composed of the two more ancient principalities of Deira and Bernicia, had since the death of Eadbert been continually convulsed by revolutions so numerous, so incessant, and so ferocious, that Charlemagne, to whom one of their princes had fled, after some vain efforts to interpose his good offices in appeasing their discords, stigmatized the Northumbrians as a nation faithless and intractable, and worse than the very pagans.* Favoured by the distracted state of Mercia and Northumbria, the genius of Egbert finally triumphed over every opposition ; and although the title of the first monarch of all England, which has sometimes been given to him, is neither jus tified by facts nor was ever claimed by his own assumption,} his general supremacy over the contemporary kings of the island revived a long suspended dignity in his per son as the eighth Bretwalda} ofthe Anglo- Saxons, and established that permanent and paramount sovereignty in the crown of Wes- In order that the condition of England be fore the Conquest may be clearly understood, it is necessary to give a brief yet comprehen sive view of the religious state of Britain before the Saxon invasion. A sketch of the history of the island after its conversion to Christianity from Druidical paganism, will properly precede its second recovery from the superstitions of its Saxon conquerors. It is an opinion commonly received that Christianity was first planted in Britain in the reign of Tiberius C\u00e6sar; but that event may be fixed with more probability after the victory of Claudius, when the Romans began to colonize the island, and to establish magistrates and jurisdictions. To what particular evangelist Britain is more imme diately indebted for its knowledge of Chris tianity, is not easy to determine. Yet although it may be difficult to ascertain who was really the first apostle of the Britons, there is no difficulty in showing that the honour does not belong to some names for whom it has been claimed. It was not James the son of Zebedee, as some have conjectured, for he suffered martyrdom before the dispersion of the apostles ; it was not Simon Zelotes, as others have supposed, for he was killed in Persia ; it was not Saint Peter, for he was the apostle of the circum cision ; it was not, according to any authentic evidence, Joseph of Arimathea, for the monastic records adduced in support of that opinion bear strong marks of forgery.* The testimonies which have been adduced to prove that a Christian church was planted by some one of the apostles, and probably by Saint Paul, are entitled to rather more consideration. The historian Eusebius,} a man high in the estimation of Constantine, the first Christian emperor, born and pro claimed in Britain, having proved that the apostles of Christ who preached the Gospel * Malmcs. p. 26. f Mr. Turner, vol. i. p. 441, has distinctly disproved the assertion. Egbert styled himself no more than king of the West Saxons, as his predecessors had done ; and as indeed his successors, until Athelstan, continued to do. Even the great Alfred, though sometimes called primus monurcha by the Saxon chroniclers, retained the old style, and was not in strict truth king of all England, since Danish princes divided the sovereignty with him ; and Athelstan was properly the earliest monarch ofthe whole Anglo-Saxon nation.

In the number of those countries he specifies those which are called the British Islands.* Theodoret} also, in his enumeration of the different nations converted by the apostles, names the Britons ; and in another part of his history, speaking of the labours and success of Saint Paul, he says, that after his release from confinement at Rome that apostle went into Spain, and thence carried the light of the Gospel to other nations, and to the islands which lie in the ocean. Some ecclesiastical writers, for particular reasons, have endeavoured to show that Saint Peter was the original apostle of Britain, but the evidence adduced in support of this opinion is of the most frivolous character. The controversy, however, is of use in showing, from the concurrence of two opposite parties in the fact, that Christianity was planted in Britain soon after the death of its Divine Author. Verulam, which had a Roman colony, and who had been converted from paganism by a priest to whom he had afforded protection from the general persecution. Though Constantius, the Roman governor of Britain, had an inclination to favour the Christians, yet it was not in his power to dispense with the edicts of the emperors, and he complied so far with them as to demolish the churches. This act, however, was compulsory, and it was forgiven on account of his subsequent conduct when he succeeded to the imperial crown. Though he died a pagan, yet he granted to the Christians a free exercise of their religion, and protected them from injury or insult. This emperor, it is well known, died at York, and succeeded in securing the throne to his son Constantine. From the accession of Constantine must be dated the re-estab lishment of Christianity in the British Islands. The happy change is thus de scribed by Gildas : \u2014 \" After a persecution of ten years, its authors were taken off by remarkable judgments, the Christians were brought back to a state of ease, the victorious Cross was displayed, the churches were rebuilt, and the holy solemnities kept with out any disturbance.\" At that period a church was erected at Verulam in honour of Saint Alban, and the town was called by his name. The Gospel having been introduced into Britain, a Christian church subsisted there, though not always in an equal degree of vigour, till the persecution of Diocletian.} It then acquired new strength and reputa tion from the pious fortitude of its martyrs. Though the names of only three \u00a7 of those confessors have been recorded, yet all his torians agree that numbers suffered in Britain with the greatest constancy and courage. || The first martyr is said to have been Saint Alban, who lived in the town of But the first decisive evidence of the settled condition of the British churches, is found in the number of bishops which attended the Council of Aries. The canons of that council were subscribed by Eborius, bishop of York, Restitutus, bishop of Lon don, and Adelpius, bishop of the Third Province into which Britain was then divided, and which was sometimes called Britannia Secunda* We are not, however, to conclude that there were no more than three bishops at that time in Britain, for it was the custom of every national church to send a deputation of its prelacy to a general council. When the Emperor Constantine first summoned a council, a number of \"Et) rkf xa>.',uui.x; Bvir-arixas mfOOf. f Theod. torn. iv. Serin. 9.

But the traditions of the British writers are so blended with fiction, that this fact docs not merit insertion in the body of our narrative.

The errors of Pelagius have indeed been charged originally on the British people, and his fierce and conten tious spirit has been attributed to national temperament* Several bishops of Britain were seduced by Agricola, a disciple of Pelagius ; and Prosper, speaking of the efforts of C\u00e6lestine to eradicate the Pelagian heresy, says that it had taken possession of the soil from which it originally sprang.} Yet the opposition to Pelagianism in Britain was vigorous and persevering, and the British bishops, distrusting their own sufficiency to encounter it, called in the aid of their Galil ean neighbours.} Lupus and Germanus, bishops of great reputation, accepted the invitation, and in a conference with the' Pelagians at Verulam \u00a7 they defended the orthodox faith in so convincing a manner that they left Britain, as they supposed, con firmed in the principles of pure Christianity. But no sooner had they returned to Gaul than Pelagianism again raised its head, and Germanus undertook a second voyage to Britain, in company with Severus. Des pairing of convincing the Pelagians by argu ment, Germanus procured their banishment by an edict of Valentinian, and from that time, according to the testimony of Bede, the British churches continued sound and orthodox. bishops appeared from Britain proportional with other provinces of the empire. The regular ordination of the British bishops was undisputed, and their subscriptions were received without any question of their authority ; an argument sufficiently convinc ing that their character was as well authen ticated as that of the other prelates. When the Christian church was disturbed by the Arian heresy, and the Council of Nice was convened to compose its divisions, there is no direct evidence that any bishops from Britain were present. But it must be remembered that the subscriptions to the canons of the first Nicene council are con fused and imperfect even in the best copies ; and there is a strong presumption, although not a direct proof, that the bishops of Britain were summoned, and that some of them appeared. Eusebius relates that it was the intention of Constantine to procure as large an assemblage as possible of bishops from all parts of the empire, and for that purpose his summons was universal. In the epistle of the emperor to the different churches, it is distinctly expressed that there was a necessity for all bishops to meet together, in order to settle and determine the true Christian faith. There is only a strong presumption of the appearance of any British bishops at the Council at Nice, but for their presence at the Council of Ariminium and Sardica* there is equally positive evidence as for their attendance at the Council of Aries. They subscribed the definitions in favour of Arianism, but their subscriptions were ex torted by the Emperor Constantius, and it is probable that after their return they followed the example of the Gallican church by re-establishing the Nicene faith. In the time of Jovian, Athanasius mentions the orthodoxy ofthe Britannic churches.} Besides the suppression of Pelagianism the Gallican bishops rendered other aid to the British church, in the institution of schools, and in the introduction of a liturgy. Germanus and Lupus were in this instance, as well as in the confutation of the Pelagian doctrine, the principal benefactors to our island. They consecrated several bishops, and they sounded a cathedral at Llandaff, over which Dubricius, a disciple of Ger manus, was placed. The authority of Dub ricius was archiepiscopal, but how far it extended is uncertain. The celebrated Arianism, it is probable, only slightly infected the British churches;} they were * Sulpit.

The church of Cornwall is involved in yet greater obscurity than that of Wales. * Two British bishops, we are told by Bede, assisted Wini, bishop of Winchester, at the consecration of the archbishop of York ; but whether they were bishops of the Cornish Britons, tributary to the West Saxons, or whether they were bishops of South Wales, there is not sufficient evidence to determine. Thus much is certain, that the Christians in Cornwall were numerous, and that they preserved their ancient rites and usages till the latter end of the seventh century. Such were the faith and learning of the British church ; its liturgy and ritual were those of Gaul, derived, as it is said, from Saint John, through Iren\u00e6us and Polycarp.} It is acknowledged by the Romanists that the liturgies of Rome and Gaul were differ ent; and Charlemagne affirms not only that there was a difference, but that the Gallican churches were unwilling to change their ancient service, and to practise a conformity with the Church of Rome.} With the exception of Wales and Corn wall, however, the light of Christianity was extinguished in Britain, and the natives complied with the paganism of their Saxon conquerors ; and since those conquerors remained in their primitive ignorance for more than a century and a half, the ecclesi astical history of England presents nothing but a few unconnected traditionary events, till we come to the foundation of the Anglo- Saxon church. Having described the establishment, we must now give an account of the declension, of the British church. On the subjugation of the island by the Saxons, whose progress we have already traced, Christianity appears to have main tained itself only in Wales and in Cornwall. In Wales we find the schools of Dubricius and Iltutus ; and also Saint David, whose name is still preserved in the Saxon church. \u00a7 The tutelary saint of Wales was educated under Paulinus, a disciple of Germanus ; he then visited Jerusalem, where he received episcopal consecration from the patriarch ; and soon after his return was held, at a place called Lhandewy, the famous Synod of BrevyJ a general convention of all the bishops and clergy of Britain on account of the Pelagian controversy. Saint David was present at that synod, and by his author ity and eloquence suppressed Pelagianism. There also he was chosen by general con- For a long time the conversion of the Saxon nation had attracted the compas sionate attention of the bishops of Rome ; and Gregory the Great, who had cherished the wish with more than common zeal, at length found that circumstances were favour able to its completion. It was at the end of the sixth century of the Christian era, and about one hundred and fifty years after the first invasion of England by the Saxons, that Ethelbert, the king of Kent, received intelligence that a number of men clad in a foreign garb, and practising several unusual * \"We know scarcely anything of the early transactions of the Welsh or the Cornish before the Saxons invaded them, and so united their own history with that of the native Britons.

This band consisted of Augustin, a monk of the newly-founded order of Bene dictines, with forty of his associates, who had landed in the Isle of Thanet, the same place on which the Saxons had made their hostile descent. In the change of the national religion care was taken to render the transition from paganism to Christianity as little violent as was possible in any change from error to truth. It was a maxim with Gregory, under whose auspices the mission was undertaken and conducted, that the pagan temples should not be destroyed, especially when they were well built ; but that the idols having been previously removed from them, they should be consecrated by more holy rites to better purposes. He was unwilling wantonly to offend the prejudices of the people by a profanation of those objects which had long been regarded with venera tion, and he carried his compliance so fa> as to connive at their ancient sacrifices. He ordered that oxen should, as usual, be slaughtered near the churches,* and that the indulgence of ancient festivities should accompany the celebration of new cere monies. Whatever popular customs were found not absolutely inconsistent with Christianity were retained.} Even the names of some of the Christian festivals were taken from those of the heathens, which had been observed at the same time of the year. The names of the days of the week also were retained, though derived from pagan deities. At his first interview with these strangers Ethelbert heard them in the open air, on a principle of Druidical superstition, in order to counteract the effects of their enchant ments.* Augustin delivered the purport of his mission through a Gallic interpreter. Its favourable reception had been secured by Bertha, the queen of Ethelbert, daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, and her self a Christian. A place in the city of Canterbury, the capital of the kingdom of Kent, was allotted for the reception of Augustin and his companions. They entered in solemn procession, preceded by two persons bearing a cross of silver, and a painted figure of Christ, and singing litanies as they proceeded, to avert the divine wrath from the unbelievers. As Ethelbert soon avowed his own conversion, the principal part of his subjects, and especially his nobles, followed his example, induced, as it is said, by many signal miracles performed by Augustin and his companions, but un doubtedly influenced by the extraordinary zeal of the missionaries, and the sanctity of their lives. The new religion, adopted by a prince so respected as Ethelbert, soon spread itself through all that part of England which lies south-west of the Humber. The prudence of the missionaries in the gradual propagation of religious truth, and their activity in disseminating their doc trines, were joined with a superiority in the arts of civil life. When Christianity was first preached in Sussex, that country was reduced to the utmost distress by a drought which had continued during three years. The barbarous inhabitants, destitute of any means to alleviate the calamity of famine, frequently united in bodies, and precipi tating themselves from the cliffs were either drowned or dashed in pieces by the rocks. It is probable that the Druidical order did not at that time subsist among the Anglo-Saxons, or else that it had greatly declined in authority and reputation, since Christianity experienced little or no oppo sition from the pagan priesthood. On the contrary, some of that body were among the foremost in embracing the new doctrine. But even if Druidism did not then flourish in its former vigour, still the religion of the Anglo-Saxons was derived from a Druidical source, and the capital objects of their wor- Bede, Hist.

In this extremity Wilfrid, their first Christian preacher, collected nets, and plunged into the sea at the head of his attendants ; and having first provided sus tenance for their famishing bodies, he soon disposed their minds to receive his spiritual instructions. being generally converted by their queens. Ecclesiastical establishments were gradually formed, as they were demanded by the relig ious wants of the people, or as these wants were anticipated by the piety of the Saxon princes. Augustin erected the cathedral of Christ Church in the city of Canterbury, and sounded there a Benedictine abbey called after his own name ; and having received episcopal ordination from the bishop of Aries, he was invested by Pope Gregory with a jurisdiction over all the Saxon prelates.* Not only was the introduction of Chris tianity attended by the progress of civiliza tion, but with another blessing, that of liberty. The Christian kings sometimes made donations to the church of lands which they had obtained by conquest from their heathen enemies, and the clergy, so soon as they had baptized their new vassals, accompanied the sacred rite with manumis sion. Such conduct naturally endeared the persons as well as the doctrines of their teachers to a people who saw religion and freedom advancing with equal steps. These monks, indeed, deserve the praise of enlarged and generous views for the improvement of mankind. In a canon wherein the clergy were prohibited from alienating their lands, among other charitable exceptions to the rule, it was specified that they might do so for the release of slaves by purchase. This duty which they were most careful to prac tise, they were not less earnest in enforcing on their flocks. Whenever they imposed penance, they permitted no other commuta tion than acts of charity and beneficence. They urged their penitents to the enfran chisement and redemption of slaves, and to the repair of public works ; and they prac tically taught that no offences could be expiated unless by some act which con tributed to the happiness and welfare of As the Anglo-Saxon church was estab lished through the popes they were naturally solicitous to preserve its dependence on the see of Rome, and for the period of a century from its foundation the English primacy was filled by foreigners nominated by the Roman pontiffs. By these foreign prelates considerable accessions were made to the originally scanty stock of Saxon literature, the largest as well as the most valuable of which additions arose from Theodore, the seventh archbishop of Canterbury, of whom we shall have occasion to speak more fully hereafter. He was a Greek by birth, a man of lofty spirit, of enlarged views, and of cultivated talents. Unexpectedly raised to his high station, he laboured with singular activity to render his attainments useful to the comparatively barbarous people com mitted to his pastoral charge. He first introduced the study of his native language into the island ; he brought with him a number of books in different faculties, and among them a magnificent copy of the works of Homer. Under his patronage a school was founded at Canterbury, and thus both the great fountains of knowledge, the Greek and Latin tongues, were opened in England. The labours of Theodore were not con fined to the British Isles ; they are recorded in the annals of the general Christian church. Among his other works, he re duced to a regular science that branch of ecclesiastical law which is commonly known society. The marriage of Ethelbert to a Christian princess was, as we have seen, the mean of introducing Christianity into his dominions ; and similar influence contributed to extend it through the other kingdoms of the Hept archy, the respective sovereigns of them \u2666 Bede, Hist. lib. i. c. 23. si"], [80, "[a.d. 597-604. 42 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. darkness without endeavouring to enlighten their ignorance. It was impossible that any Christians under Saxon oppression could have been fit instruments for the conversion of their persecutors; and it was unlikely that the conquerors, engaged in foreign and domestic wars, should have been favourably disposed towards the religion of their vas sals. The reproach is, therefore, unjust and groundless. by the name of Penitential discipline ; and published his celebrated \"Penitentiale,\"* by which the clergy were taught to distinguish sins into various classes, both as to their degrees of guilt and their publicity. He discriminated the degrees of guilt according to the nature ofthe offence, its consequences, the intention of the offender, the time and place of commission, and the circumstances under which it was committed. The \"Peni tentiale\" likewise contained the different modes of proceeding against offenders ; it pointed out the penalties suitable to the various classes of transgressions ; it pre scribed the different forms of consolation, of exhortation, and of absolution ; and it detailed in an ample and accurate manner the duty of those who were appointed to receive the confessions of penitents. The discipline of Theodore, though he was of Grecian extraction, was eagerly adopted by the Latin churches, and in a short time it passed from Britain into all the western pro vinces. It was universally practised until penitentiary discipline assumed a new form, under the title of the canon of indulgences. It has been already related, that so soon as Augustin had communicated to Gregory an account of the success of his mission, he received from the pontiff the pall, the em blem of metropolitical dignity. Had the English missionary been contented with the title and office of a bishop, there would have been no room for censure ; but that he should aspire to the dignity of a metropolitan when he had no suffragan under his jurisdiction, has laid him open to the charge of vanity and ambition. He was, it is true, solicitous to correct the anomaly as soon as possible, after his return from Aries; and he founded an episcopal see at Rochester, of which Justus, one of his companions, was consti tuted the first bishop. As yet the Anglo-Saxon church has been considered only in regard to its triumph over paganism, and its beneficial influence on the morals and laws of a barbarous nation; it remains to consider the contests between the Anglo-Saxon and the ancient British church which still existed in the northern and western parts of the island. In these strug gles the governors of the Anglo-Saxon church have incurred severe reproach. The Roman mission of Augustin has been set forth with so much pomp, and its charitable motives as well as its salutary effects have been so highly extolled, that the conversion of the Saxons has been ascribed solely to the Christian zeal of the popes. This is not surprising; but it is not with equal justice that the Saxon historians have reproached their neighbours the British Christians with having suffered the invaders to live in pagan Augustin being invested by Gregory with the primacy of Britain, and with a jurisdic tion over its bishops, together with a com mission to teach the unlearned, to confirm the weak, and to punish the obstinate, applied himself with the greatest anxiety to reduce the British bishops to conformity with the Church of Rome. Instead of pro pagating the Christian faith among un believers, his chief exertions were directed to the extension and enlargement of his own authority, and that of his patron Gregory. The Gospel having been preached in Britain either by the Apostles of Christ or by their immediate followers, the British churches had as yet always observed the customs and ceremonies prescribed by their first teachers. Their forms were remarkable for simplicity, whereas Augustin introduced a number of pompous ceremonies borrowed from the Romish ritual. The Britons, * The Penitentiale of Theodore is yet extant, though mutilated and imperfect. An edition was published at Paris in the year 1679 by Petit."], [81, "a.d. G04.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 43 maintaining but little intercourse with the rest of the world, had scarcely any com munication with the bishops of Rome, and considered them as no more than diocesan bishops, or at the highest as patriarchs, on whom their own church had no dependence. But Augustin, out of the abundance of his gratitude to that see from which he derived his own authority, sought to gain from the British prelates an acknowledgment of the supremacy of the Roman pontiff over the whole Christian church. For that pur pose he secured the co-operation of Ethel bert, and succeeded also in obtaining a conference with the British bishops on the borders of the county of Worcester.* The synod being assembled, Augustin proposed, first, that the Britons should embrace the unity of the Catholic church, and then co-operate with him and his clergy in con verting the pagan natives. This proposi tion, however reasonable at first sight, was not received with approbation; Augustin was unable to prevail on the British bishops to admit the slightest change in their ancient customs. The historians of this period relate that, finding his arguments ineffectual, he caused a blind man to be introduced into the assembly, whose restora tion to sight, after useless similar attempts by the Britons, he effected by his prayers. But even against this miracle the Britons were impenetrable, and all the concession which Augustin could obtain was, that they would take into consideration the proposi tions which he had submitted, and would come to a determination in a future synod. of their ancestors, and adopt those of Au gustin? His answer was, that he saw no reason why they should adopt any alterations in their religion, simply on the bare request of a stranger; but since the essence of reli gion consisted in love and unity, not in forms, if the stranger were a holy man and sent from God they should follow him. This answer occasioned a second question, By what marks they could discern whether he were a holy man or not? The answer of the anchorite was worthy of his reputa tion: he told them to judge the character and pretensions by the conduct of the man who supported them. If he were meek and humble, then they might conclude that he was the disciple of Him who had taught men to bear his yoke; but if the stranger were haughty and arrogant, then it was cer tain that he could not be sent from God, whatever might be his pretensions. The Britons, still unsatisfied, demanded what were those marks of gentleness and conde scension by which they might discern of what spirit the stranger was? \" His spirit,\" the sage replied, \"you will discern in this: let him and his companions first come to the synod, and if on your approach he shall rise up in condescension and love, and greet you, then look upon him as a servant of Christ, and submit to whatever he shall ordain; but if he shall contemptuously refuse to rise up to you who are the greater num ber, then let him see that you despise his insolence, and disclaim his authority.\"* After some time had been consumed in these deliberations, the British bishops, seven in number, with Dinoth, abbot of Bano-or, and some other learned men, con sented to meet Augustin at a second confer ence. The archbishop and his companions were seated in the place of meeting before the Britons entered, and as Augustin did not rise from his seat to receive them, they acted in conformity with the advice of the hermit, and opposed all his overtures of union with great spirit and perseverance. After a violent contest, the archbishop ad- The Britons having returned from the conference, and considering that their obstinacy might draw on them the resent ment of Ethelbert, applied themselves to a consideration of the propositions. Not being able to come to any conclusion among themselves, they solicited the advice of an anchorite of great reputation for sanctity and wisdom, and besought him to give an opinion on this difficult question, Whether they ought to quit the customs and usages * The place has been since called Angiislin'a O.ik. \u2666 Bede, Hist. Eccl lib. ii c. 2."], [82, "[a.d. 604. 44 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. power into those hands from which they had received it. dressed them in these words: \u2014 \"In many things you act contrary to our customs, as well as to the usages of the Catholic church ; notwithstanding, if you will submit to my authority in these three matters, namely, in observing the Easter festival after our man ner, in using the same rites and ceremonies with the Church of Rome, and in joining with us to convert the Saxon pagans ; in all other things which you do contrary to our customs, we will bear with you.\" To this demand the British bishops answered, that they would not comply with any one of the three particulars, neither would they acknow ledge him for their archbishop. Augustin, fired with indignation at this refusal, an swered them with threats, and plainly inti mated, that if they would not accept peace from their brethren, they must expect war from their enemies ; and if they would not preach the word of life to the Saxons, they should themselves suffer death. Thus the project entertained by Augustin, of establishing his power as metropolitan over the whole British island, was defeated. But the Saxon historian has added, that Ethelfrith, king of Northumbria, sent a large army into Wales, and not only gained a signal triumph over the British near Caer leon, but slaughtered the ecclesiastics, and particularly the monks of Bangor. If this event happened during the life of Augustin and at his instigation, he must, in addition to his acknowledged haughtiness and ambi tion, be charged with cruelty and revenge. Having related the state of the Anglo- Saxon church at the death of Augustin, we proceed next to describe its advancement under Lawrence, who succeeded him in the see of Canterbury, and whom he had con secrated for that end a short time before his death. In the scheme of ecclesiastical government which Gregory had transmitted, he directed that the primacy should be removed from Canterbury to London at the death of Augustin; and Mellitus, one of the companions of Augustin, had been conse crated bishop of that see. But the scheme of Gregory was found to be impracticable, and his authority was disavowed. The city of London was not yet converted to Chris tianity, and therefore could not be the see of the metropolitan of the Anglo-Saxon church. Ethelbert, likewise, while he lived, would not permit the removal of the pri macy from his own kingdom, nor the sub jecting of his bishops to the jurisdiction of a bishop of London. Such is the account delivered by Bede of this synod; but the British writers, as may be learned from Leland, give a different view of the transaction. He relates, that Dinoth, abbot of Bangor, disputed with great ability, and spoke at great length, against submission to the authority of the bishop of Rome or the bishop of Canter bury, and that he defended the authority of the archbishop of Caerleon, or Saint David's. \"You propose to us,\" he said, \"obedience to the Church of Rome; are you ignorant that we already owe a deference of love and charity to the Church of God, to the bishop of Rome, and to all Christians? Other obe dience than this to the pope we know not, and this we are always ready to pay. But for a superior, what need have we to go so far as Rome, when we are governed under God by the archbishop of Caerleon, who hath authority to superintend our churches and our ecclesiastical affairs.\" The abbot of Bangor went so far as to censure the pope for permitting the usurpation of Au gustin, telling him and his companions that it was their duty, if they were good Chris tians, to restore their unjust and tyrannical Lawrence, therefore, was both the second archbishop of Canterbury, and the second primate of the Anglo-Saxon church ; and he not only imitated the vigour of his prede cessor, but supported his authority, by the assiduity of his preaching and the strict ness of his life.

HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 45 By the interest of Mellitus, the conversion of the East Saxons inhabiting the counties of Middlesex and Essex was happily accom plished. He appeared at the court of Sebert in his episcopal character, and that prince, together with a multitude of his subjects, embraced the Christian religion and were baptized. The abbey church of Westmin ster was built on the site of a heathen temple dedicated to Apollo, and was conse crated by Mellitus to the honour of God, and dedicated to Saint Peter. Another stately edifice, intended for the cathedral, was erected on the ruins of a temple of Diana, and was consecrated to Saint Paul.* cution of Christianity commenced, and Mel litus was commanded to leave the kingdom of the East Saxons. The condition of the church of Kent, although depressed, was not, like that of the East Saxons, destroyed, and thither Mellitus fled for protection. After a con sultation with the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Rochester, it was con cluded that an open resistance against the general apostasy would be fruitless, and that their personal safety demanded their imme diate return to Rome. Mellitus and Justus, bishop of Rochester, immediately departed, and thus deserted the cause in which they had engaged. Lawrence also resolved to follow them, and on the evening before his intended desertion of his pastoral charge, he caused his bed to be brought into the cathe dral, purposing to take his rest there on the last night of his stay. But according to the legend which Bede has transmitted to us, Saint Peter appeared to him in a form more appalling than thatof an unsubstantial vision ; for, after reproaching the cowardice of the primate, the apostle inflicted on him a severe flagellation. On the next day Lawrence appeared before the king, bearing the marks of the discipline which he had undergone in the preceding night; and having given an account of the manner in which he had received his castigation, the king was so affected, that he changed both his faith and morals, and became a Christian and a new man.* Neither Ethelbert nor Bertha long sur- vived Augustin, and on the death of the former paganism revived in the kingdom of Kent, and threatened the destruction of the British church. Eadbald, the son and successor of Ethelbert, either had never been converted to Christianity, or, as soon as he possessed the crown, had renounced it. His morals were licentious, and the cause of his apostasy or his aversion from Christianity is said to have been an inces- tuous connection which he had formed with his father's wife. The archbishop had re- monstrated with him in a manner becoming it Christian teacher, but his reprimands were received with disgust. The king was a lati- tudinarian in principle as well as a libertine in practice, and he encouraged his subjects tp restore the pagan idolatry. Notwith- s^nding the zeal and assiduity of the arch- bishop of Canterbury, of the bishop of Rochester, and of the clergy in general, the defection of the people from Christianity was great. The calamities of the Christians were increased by the death of Sebert, king of the East Saxons ; for notwithstanding his own recent conversion, his three sons, who jointly succeeded him, had not sincerely renounced idolatry. They, indeed, kept their opinions secret during the life of their father ; but he was no sooner dead than they openly avowed paganism, and gave their subjects also liberty to profess it. A perse- Eadbald, being converted by this miracle or stratagem, sent to France to recall Melli tus and Justus to their dignity and duty. Those fugitives returned about a year after their flight, and the bishop of Rochester was reinstated in his see by the king of Kent. The inhabitants of London having refused to admit Mellitus, Eadbald afforded him an honourable retreat in Kent, till the death of Lawrence, when he succeeded to the primacy. Mellitus continued in that station about five years, without much exer tion for the advancement of Christianity, * Bede, lib. ii. c. 5, 6. Bede, Hist. Eccl. lib. ii. c. 3."], [84, "(~a.d. 627. 46 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. and at his death Justus, the only surviving bishop consecrated by Augustin, was raised to the archbishopric. with eleven other persons of his court and family, should be baptized by Paulinus;* and since the assassin who had attempted his life was employed by the king of Wes sex, he promised to renounce idolatry, if the God of the Christians would avenge him of his enemy. With the exception of the abortive at tempt to plant the Anglo-Saxon church in the kingdom of the East Saxons, its limits had as yet been bounded by the kingdom of Kent ; it next extended itself into the king dom of Northumbria. Northumbria at that time was governed by Edwin, the most powerful prince in the Saxon heptarchy, whose proposed alliance was eagerly accepted by Eadbald. Their connection was to be cemented by a marriage between Edwin and Ethelburga, the sister of Eadbald; but as Edwin was still a pagan, Eadbald insisted that it was not lawful for his sister, who had been educated in the Christian faith, to con tract a marriage with an idolater. Edwin readily stipulated not to oppose the religion which the princess had embraced, and to grant liberty of worship both to herself and her retinue ; and more than this he added, that if on examination he found the Christian faith more worthy of belief than that in which he had been educated, he was inclined to conversion. As soon as Edwin had recovered from his wound he marched at the head of a large army into the dominions of the king of Wessex; yet although he returned crowned with victory, he deferred the entire per formance of his vow.} He at once, indeed, disengaged himself from idolatry; but when the queen and Paulinus urged him to pro ceed further, he answered that the adoption of a religion different from that in which he had been educated was a matter which required solemn and mature deliberation. For some time he continued in a state of suspense, or rather of neutrality, until Pope Boniface attempted to remove his doubts. The pontiff wrote to Edwin, pointing out the folly of the pagan worship;} and to Ethelburga also, exhorting her to renew her arguments and persuasions with the king, and never to remit her prayers to Heaven for a blessing on her endeavours. But for a long time the epistles of Boniface, the entreaties of Ethelburga, and the instruc tions of Paulinus, were equally ineffectual. Edwin was not to be won unless by convic tion, and he examined the evidences of the new religion with candour and impartiality. On such a satisfactory basis the treaty of marriage between Edwin and Ethelburga was completed, and when the princess left her brother's court for that of Edwin she took with her Paulinus, one of the mission aries who had been sent by Pope Gregory, and who had been consecrated to the epis copal order by Justus.* At his first arrival in Northumbria, Paulinus seems to have made little progress in converting either the king or his subjects; but aster Ethelburga had been delivered of a daughter, and Ed win had been dangerously wounded by an assassin, these two events altered his pros pects. The king was inclined to believe that the prayers of Paulinus had contributed towards the happy parturition of Ethelburga, and his own imminent peril also had dis posed his mind to serious reflection. As a proof of the change in his sentiments he consented that his infant daughter, together At length he avowed his assent to the truth of Christianity, influenced by the dex terous application which Paulinus made of an event which we have already related in the earlier part of the king's life, or as the monkish historian would persuade us, by the intervention of a positive miracle. Paulinus, having heard the circumstances of the vision seen by Edwin when a wanderer and a guest at the court of Redwald, one day entered the king's apartment as he was pursuing his meditations on the opposing religions, and advancing with a solemn air, imitated the * Bede. f Chron. Sax. p. 28. J Bedo, Hist. Eccl. lib. ii. c. 10. * Bede, Hist. Eccl. lib. ii. c. 9."], [85, "a.d. 627.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 47 action of the imaginary figure, and placed his hand on the head of the Northumbrian prince. \" Do you understand,\" inquired Paulinus, \"the meaning of this token?\" Surprised at the question, yet recollecting the divine oracle, Edwin is said to have prostrated himself at the feet of Paulinus; who, preventing this act of humiliation, reminded the king in a tone of authority that it was his duty to obey the injunction of God, by submitting himself to the religion which that God had revealed. Edwin im mediately resigned himself to the direction of his spiritual guide, and yielded an implicit assent to the Christian faith.* The king, pleased with this address, ap plied to the priest next in dignity, who enforced the opinion of Coifi, in the follow ing manner: \u2014 \" The present life of man, 0 king, seems to me, if compared with that after period which is so uncertain to us, to resemble a scene at one of your wintry feasts. As you are sitting with your ealdormen and thanes about you, the fire blazing in the centre, and the whole hall cheered with its warmth, and while storms of rain and snow are raging without; a little sparrow flies in at one door, roams around our festive meet ing, and passes out at some other entrance. Wiile it is among us, it feels not the wintry tempest, itenjoys the short comfort and seren ity of its transient stay; but then plunging into the winter from which it had flown, it disappears from our eyes. Such is here the life of man. It acts and thinks before us, but, as of what preceded its appearance among us we are ignorant, so are we of all that is destined to come afterwards. If then, on this momentous suture, this new doctrine reveals anything more certain or reasonable, it is in my opinion entitled to our acquiescence.\"* How much of this supernatural appearance ought to be attributed to the credulity of the age it is unnecessary in this place to inquire. The fact which now demands relation is the manner in which Edwin procured the con- version of his subjects. He had held fre- quent conferences with Coifi, his pagan high priest, on the arguments which Paulinus urged in favour of Christianity, and Coifi perceiving from these conversations the bias of his sovereign, resolved not to oppose his wishes. When Edwin, therefore, summoned a council to inquire the sentiments of his nobles concerning the new religion, and to propose that if they participated in his own feelings they might all be baptized together, Coifi, in the order of precedence, rose first, and thus addressed his prince and the assem- bly : \u2014 \" You see, 0 king, what is now preached to us. I declare to you most truly, what I have most certainly experienced, that the religion which we have hitherto pro- fessed contains no virtue at all, and as little utility. No one of all your court has been more attentive than 1 have been to the wor- ship of our gods ; and yet many have received far richer benefits, far greater honours, and have prospered more in all that men transact or pursue, than I have. If then, on due inquiry, you shall perceive that those new things which are preached to us will be better and more efficacious, let us hasten to adopt them without any delay.\" The other royal counsellors exhibited similar dispositions. Paulinus was imme diately summoned, and having stated the arguments in favour of Christianity, Coifi declared aloud that there was no further room for doubt. \"Formerly,\" he said, \" I understood nothing that I worshipped. The more I contemplated our idolatry, the less truth I found in it. But this new system I adopt without hesitation, for truth shines around it, and presents to us the gifts of eternal life and blessedness. Let us then, 0 king, immediately anathematize and burn the temples and altars which we have so uselessly venerated.\" To show the sincerity of his conversion, or the warmth of his zeal, the high priest, on being asked who would be the first to profane the idols and their altars, answered, \" I will; as I have led the way in adoring them through my folly, I will give the example of destroying them in * Bede, lib. ii. c. 12. * Bede, lib. ii. c. 13."], [86, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 635. 48 obedience to that wisdom which I have learned from the true God.\" Placing him self at the head of the other priests, Coifi, armed with a sword and lance, and mounted on one of the king's chargers, proceeded to the heathen temple, hurled his lance at the idol, and assisted in burning his sanctuary to the ground. * he not only instructed the pagans in the principles of Christianity, but he was an eminent example of holiness and charity. At his desire the king of Northumbria, without any regard to the appointment of Gregory or the succeeding popes, removed the archiepiscopal see from York to a small isle at the mouth of the river Lindis, known by the name of Holy Island. Here Aidan discharged all the important duties of a bishop, diligently preaching the word of God, and exhibiting a model of primitive simplicity totally unlike the pomp of the Romish missionaries. The see of York was for many years neglected; its bishops were reduced to the state of diocesan bishops, and went into Scotland to receive consecration. Edwin having declared his conversion, was baptized at York, with two sons by a former wife, and Hilda his niece; and all the nobility and courtiers followed his ex ample. His love for Christianity incited him to propagate it beyond his own domi nions, and his efforts were first directed to Eorpwald, king of the East Angles, the son of Redwald. Sigebyrht, the brother and successor of Eorpwald, not only contributed to the dissemination of Christianity in East Anglia, but applied himself so closely to the study of it, as to be called by the chronicler \" Most Learned.\"} Having thus related the foundation of the Northumbrian church, we now turn to that of Wessex, which was planted about this time by the care of Birinus. He came into England already invested with the episcopal character, and with the sanction of the bishop of Rome. It was his original design to preach the gospel in the interior of the country where no religious instructor had preceded him ; but happening to land in the territories of the king of Wessex, and finding that they were overspread with paganism, he thought it unnecessary to go further. Here then he entered on his office, and performed it with effect. The king of Wessex was tributary to the king of North umberland, and the two princes therefore joined in a grant to Birinus of the city of Dorchester near Oxford, where an episcopal see was sounded, and where Birinus con tinued to edify his converts both by instruc tion and example until his death. Edwin having enjoyed a long reign of prosperity, was destined to experience a reverse of fortune. Five years had not elapsed after his conversion before he was slain in battle, and paganism once more overspread his dominions. Of the North umbrian Christians some fell with their prince on the field, and others were put to death. Ethelburga and her children, accom panied by Paulinus, were compelled to flee for safety into the kingdom of Kent. The affairs of the Northumbrian church remained in a calamitous state until Oswald ascended the throne ; he first restored external peace, and then endeavoured to re-establish Christianity. But instead of recalling Paulinus, who was now bishop of Rochester, he sent for a Scottish bishop called Aidan to convert and instruct his subjects. Aidan, having received episcopal consecration, engaged with alacrity in the undertaking. His success was indeed great, yet not greater than his assiduity merited; Leaving the church of Wessex, the order of time demands that we should revert to the church already sounded in the kingdom of the East Angles. It has been mentioned, that Eorpwald had embraced the 'Christian faith, but that he had been murdered by his subjects, and his people had relapsed into idolatry. Sigebyrht, his brother, had also been compelled by a faction to retire into France. A prince of his endowments could * The scene of this event was a little to the east of York beyond the river Derwent, at a place, in the time of Bede, called Godmunddingaham, and still called Godmundham, or the home of the mund. or protection of the gods. t Flor.

He devoted himself to study, and his recreation was found in the correspondence and con versation of literary men. Convinced of the vanity and falsehood of paganism, he em braced Christianity as a revelation worthy of God. One of his chief companions and instructors was Felix, a Burgundian bishop, from whom he received the sacred rite of baptism. No sooner was Sigebyrht enabled to return to his own country and kingdom, than he endeavoured to introduce amons his subjects the learning which he had imbibed in France, and above all other things, to establish the Christian faith. Whether he sent for Felix, or whether Felix came volun tarily into England, it is not material to determine. As soon as that bishop arrived, he applied to Honorius, then archbishop of Canterbury, either for advice in the exercise of his sacred function, or for authority to assume episcopal jurisdiction. Honorius approved and promoted the design of Felix, who was received at the court of Sigebyrht with the highest marks of respect, and the city of Dummock, now called Dunwich, in the county of Suffolk, was assigned for his episcopal residence. The king and the bishop co-operated in the erection of schools, and some historians ascribe the foundation of the University of Cambridge to the munificence of Sigebyrht. urged his friend to inquire into the grounds of the religion in which he had been edu cated.* The inquiry was followed by the conversion of Sigebyrht to Christianity, and the new convert was baptized by Finan, bishop of the Northumbrians. Chad, a Northumbrian priest, and an English man by birth, had long been employed as a missionary in the midland counties, and he was induced to transfer his spirit ual labours to the kingdom of the East Saxons. He received consecration from Finan, assisted by two other bishops, and was placed in the episcopal see of London, from which Mellitus had been expelled forty years before. The next kingdom which was converted to Christianity was the powerful state of Mercia. Penda, its king, was remarkable for his cruelty and pride ; and during a long reign had been actively opposed to a religion so alien from his own temper as Christianity. But that tyrant was at last brought to tole rate, though not to profess, the gospel.} He had a son endued with qualities the reverse of his own; and the young prince, being enamoured of a daughter of the king of Northumbria named Atheleda, embraced the religion of his future queen. He returned to the dominions of his father accompanied by Atheleda and four priests ; and the whole kingdom of Mercia was in consequence brought under the Christian faith. From the church of the East Angles we rrmst recur to that of the East Saxons. Mel litus, as we have seen, had been expelled from London, and when he became arch bishop of Canterbury, he used his utmost endeavours to recover his ancient flock from their apostasy. But his efforts were vain, and it was reserved for the English and Scottish clergy to accomplish what had been left unfinished by the missionaries of Rome. Between Oswy, king of the Northumbrians, and Sigebyrht, the third king of the East Saxons, the existence of a firm friendship occasioned frequent interviews. During those meetings Oswy frequently turned the conversation to the errors of paganism, and Last of all, we turn to the South Saxons inhabiting the counties of Surrey and Sussex, the latest in their conversion to Christianity. The lone continuance of that kingdom in idolatry must be attributed to its subjection to the king of Wessex, and its ultimate con version to the persecution of Wilfrid bishop of York, who fled thither for safety. Edil walch its king, although educated in pagan ism, had married Edda, a Christian princess, and no sooner did Wilfrid appear at his court, than he encouraged the bishop to undertake the conversion of his subjects. Wilfrid proceeded to establish a church, and by the influence which he possessed Bede, Hist. Eccl. lib. iii. c 22. t Ibid. e. 21. 7"], [88, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a i, 449-800. 50 therefore, could not possibly accede to any terms of communion with the church of Kent, unless by submitting to the archbishop of Canterbury, and of consequence to the see of Rome. with the king, a bishopric was founded, and a cathedral built at Scolsey. Havino- thus described the manner and the instruments by which Christianity was established in every one of the states of the Anglo-Saxons, it is necessary to observe that the kingdoms of Kent, of the West Saxons, and of the East Angles, derived their faith solely from Rome, while the remainder of England, containing the whole territory from the friths of Edinburgh to the Thames, was for the most part indebted for religious instruction to the Scottish or Irish missionaries. On that account there was a great diversity in the customs and ceremonies of the different churches, which soon gave rise to factions. Every prince established such an ecclesiastical polity as suited the extent of his dominions ; and with the exception of Kent, no kingdom on the first settlement of its church had more than one episcopal see, with a bishop inde pendent of any metropolitan. The manner in which those churches, which had hitherto so vigorously opposed the Romish missionaries, at length yielded their independence is now to be related. Submission was first made by the northern churches, whose country had once been the nursery and support of the Scottish eccle siastics. Aldfrid, the natural son of Oswy, king of Northumbria, and a partner in his father's throne, had been brought over to the Church of Rome by Wilfrid his pre ceptor, a warm defender of the Catholic Easter and of the ecclesiastical tonsure. The seeds of dissension being thus sown, were not long in coming to maturity. Since the two great parties followed different cycles in finding Easter, it sometimes happened, that while the king was celebrating the Paschal festival with joy, the queen was engaged in the humiliation and austerities of Lent. Discord in the church soon cre ated a division in the state. The Romish party, possessing stronger zeal and greater activity, soon prevailed on Oswy to yield; and if a judgment may be formed from the event, the assembly which he called to dis cuss the matter was summoned rather for the purpose of defending his own reputation than of determining the question at issue. The way being thus prepared, a synod or conference took place at the monastery of Whitby in the county of York. At the head of the northern English party were Oswy himself, Hilda, abbess of the monas tery, Coleman, bishop of the Northumbrians and successor of Finan, together with all the Scottish and English ecclesiastics, secular and monastic, who had received ordination in the northern churches. On the other side appeared Enfleda, the queen of Oswy, Aldfrid, his natural son and partner of his throne, Wilfrid, the preceptor of Aldfrid, Agilbert, bishop of the West Saxons, with Agathon, a priest in his retinue, Roman, It has been seen that in the conference between Augustin and the British bishops, he promised an indulgence in many of their ancient rites, on condition of their submis sion to the Romish method of celebrating the festival of Easter, and of administering the sacrament of baptism. But it appears that both the Britons and the Scots had a liturgy distinct from that of Rome, the former using the liturgy of the Gallican church, the latter one peculiar to them selves.* The whole island may therefore be said to have been divided into two par ties; on one hand the Scottish clergy and all their adherents, on the other hand the French and Italian ecclesiastics with their followers. The church of Kent, which espoused the side of Rome, and asserted the superiority of its own primate, had the principal share in the contest. It was soon discovered that there could be no external communion between the two parties, with out a submission of one or the other, or without a mutual recognition of independ ence. The British and Scottish churches, * Called the Cursus Scotorum."], [89, "A.d. 449-800.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 51 Enfleda's confessor, and James the deacon, an assistant of Paulinus, who superintended the churches of York. The venerable Chad, who having been educated by the Scottish bishops adhered to their view of this ques tion, was allowed to be the interpreter of both parties. in language and manners, universally cele brate Easter at the same time with us. So that the inhabitants of two remote islands contend with a foolish obstinacy against the whole world.\" Since the aim of Coleman and his party was rather to defend their own usages than to convince their opponents, they persisted in appealing to the authority of St. John and Columba. But Wilfrid, after justify ing St. John, asked Coleman with an air of triumph whether he presumed to put Columba in the balance against St. Peter, the prince of the Apostles ? What answer Coleman made to this question historians do not inform us, but they proceed to relate that the king, struck with Wilfrid's inquiry, decided in favour of the Romish observance of Easter. This great point being settled, there yet remained another about which the two parties differed quite as widely, namely, the ecclesiastical tonsure. But of this controversy we know nothing more than that the Romanists were equally suc cessful in it. The king opened the meeting in a short speech reminding all who were assembled, that since they professed to serve the same God, and to expect the same heavenly king dom, they ought to observe the same rule of life, and a uniformity of worship. It was their business, therefore, to inquire which side of the question was supported by the soundest arguments, and to acqui esce in the evidence which might be laid before them. Having said this, he com manded Coleman to state the manner in which the Church of Rome celebrated Easter, and to defend his own conformity with that church. Coleman replied, that the manner in which he celebrated Easter was that which he had received from those who sent him into England, and which they received from their forefathers. \" This rite,\" he said, \" is the same which, accord ing to ecclesiastical history, was celebrated by Saint John and all the churches under the government of that blessed apostle.\" The king having delivered his decision, Coleman resigned his bishopric in disgust, and the nobility and clergy who adhered to him expressed great dissatisfaction at the event. Coleman retired into Ireland, his native country, and by this retreat gave to his adversaries all the advantage which they desired. Tuda, a deserter to the Romish party, succeeded to the bishopric ; and dying a few months after, Wilfrid, the opponent of Coleman, was appointed bishop of North umbria by the king's solicitation. When Coleman had enlarged on this argument the king commanded Agilbert to declare the manner of his observance, whence it originated, and by what authority he still conformed to it. Agilbert declined the task on account of his ignorance of the English tongue, notwithstanding there was an interpreter, and he requested that his disciple Wilfrid should be permitted to be his substitute. The king consented, and Wilfrid spoke to this effect : \" The manner of celebrating Easter practised by us we ourselves saw generally practised at Rome, where the Apostles Peter and Paul lived, taught, suffered, and were buried. The very same observance we saw in the rest of Italy and in France. Moreover, we are informed that in Africa, Asia, Egypt, and Greece the inhabitants, however differing In this manner a way was opened for the submission of the British and Scottish churches to the see of Rome. The event was, however, in some degree retarded by the relapse of the Northumbrian court into its ancient usages while Wilfrid was absent in France; but it was accomplished soon afterwards by the succession of Theodore to the metropolitan see of Canterbury. Egbert, king of Kent, shortly after he ascended his throne, consulted Oswy on the necessity of filling the primacy then vacant, and of"], [90, "[a.d. 449-800. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 52 Wilfrid, who had distinguished himself at the synod of Whitby, and in consequence had been appointed bishop of Northumbria. Yet he was not permitted to enjoy this bishopric, but had retired to his own monastery of Ripon. Many circumstances encouraged Theodore to attempt the restora tion of Wilfrid. Chad, one of the disciples of Aidan, who was settled in the bishopric. was an eminent example of apostolic piety, and indefatigable in the exercise of his pas toral functions. When he was reprimanded by Theodore for usurping the rights of Wilfrid, and for receiving consecration from the bishop of Winchester, he answered with an uncommon modesty, that he always thought himself unworthy of the episcopal character; that he undertook it not by his own choice, but at the command of his superiors ; and that if there were any defect in his title, he would cheerfully resign his trust and retire. Theodore, with all his haughtiness, was overcome by such humility, and dissuading Chad from relinquishing his episcopal function, said that he would overlook the defect of title and remedy it. Wilfrid was restored to the Northumbrian bishopric, and Chad was soon recalled from the monastic seclusion to which he had retired, to investiture with the bishopric of Lichfield. making a provision for the episcopal suc cession of the English church. After a mature deliberation the two princes resolved to appoint an Englishman to fill the office; and in pursuance of their resolution, fixed on Wighard, a priest of the church of Kent. Thus elected, he was sent to Rome with commendatory letters both from Oswy and Egbert, and was entertained there with respect and kindness. But while the cere monial for his consecration was preparing he died of a plague, which was likewise fatal to most of his retinue. This incident, while it proved a disappointment to Oswy and Egbert, furnished Vitalian the pontiff with a favourable opportunity of appointing the head of the English church by his own single authority. Without any communi cation with the two Saxon princes, he deter mined to send over a prelate of his own choice; and at first he fixed on Adrian, a Neapolitan monk, who was skilled both in the Greek and Latin tongues, but the humble monastic declined the situation. On the urgent demand ofthe pontiff, Adrian recom mended Theodore, whom we have before mentioned, a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, and the pope accepted the recommendation on condition that Adrian would accompany his nominee to England. Two motives operated with the pope in making this stipu lation : the one, that Adrian might be useful in propagating the Christian religion; the other, and the more powerful, that Theodore might be restrained from introducing the customs or dogmata of the Greek Church into the British Isles. While advances were thus rapidly making towards a union ofthe Saxon churches under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canter bury, Theodore endeavoured to prove that this union would operate to the public good, and not to his own aggrandizement; he pro posed, therefore, that the youth should be instructed in the Greek and Latin languages, in geometry, music, astronomy, arithmetic, and other useful branches of learning; and he associated Adrian with himself in the prosecution of his scheme. Having incited the Saxons to a love of learning by his own instruction and example, he sent for foreign masters and established schools : so assiduous was his labour, and so successful were his plans, that many Saxons could soon speak the Latin and Greek tongues with as much Theodore, the most learned of all the prelates who had as yet possessed the see of Canterbury, had no sooner arrived than he applied himself to secure the favour and assistance ofthe several Saxon princes. For that purpose he travelled over the greater part of England, instituted a visitation of its churches, introduced the Romish custom of celebrating Easter, and brought the people to an entire conformity with the Romish church. One ofthe principal objects of his visitation seems to have been the case of"], [91, "a.d. 449-800.] HISTORY 'OF ENGLAND. 53 fluency as their own. A school for Greek was founded in a village of Wiltshire, called from this circumstance Greek-lade, and after- wards corruptly Crieklade, the teachers of which repairing to Oxford, are supposed to have laid the foundation of that university. While the qualities of prudence and bene- volence must be ascribed to Theodore, it must not be concealed that he was ambitious and overbearing. He well knew that teachers brought from Rome would practise the usages of that church, and that possessing greatly superior attainments to the British and Scot- tish ecclesiastics, they would control, if not eradicate, their opposition. The intended union of the Saxon churches was thus accelerated. Notwithstanding the death of his two friends, the kings of Kent and North- umbria, Theodore had so far ingratiated himself with their successors and also with the other Saxon princes, that he obtained their consent to a general assembly or synod, which met at Heradford, a place in Hert- fordshire, probably that which is now the principal town of the county.* Besides the archbishop, there were present Bisi, bishop of the East Angles; a delegate from Wilfrid, bishop of NorthuinDria; Putta, bishop of Rochester; Leutherius, bishop of the West Saxons; and Winfrid, bishop of the Mer cians. These were all the bishops at that time in England, and they had all been raised to their stations by the influence of Theodore. Church, urged that they should be invio- lably observed. The first canon, which was indeed the foundation of the union, was a uniformity in the observance ofEaster. The second directed that no bishop should usurp or invade the diocese of another. The third made it unlawful for any bishop to give unnecessary trouble to any religious houses. The fourth provided that monks should not, unless for sufficient cause, remove from one religious house to another; and the fifth laid the same prohibition on the secular clergy as to their dioceses. The sixth forbade a bishop or a priest to exercise his function out of his diocese without permission of the bishop of that diocese. The seventh pro- posed an annual synod. The eighth regu- lated the priority of bishops. The ninth regarded the augmentation of the number of bishops. The tenth regarded marriages, that none should be allowed contrary to the canons, that incest should be severely pun ished, and that the liberty of divorce should be restrained. Such were the acts of this synod ; and that no contention might afterwards arise con cerning their meaning, nor any false tran scripts be published, they were committed to writing by a public notary, and confirmed by the subscription of every bishop present. This being done, the archbishop pronounced the following sentence and dismissed the assembly: \u2014 \" Whosoever shall endeavour to infringe these our definitions, conformable to the decrees of ancient canons, and con firmed by our unanimous subscription, let such a one know that he is separated from our communion, and from the exercise of all sacerdotal offices.\" the assembly had met, Theodore exhorted them, in the name of Christ, to advise with unanimity, and to determine with sincerity. He enjoined them to observe inviolably those ordinances which had been canonically decreed by the Fathers. Then recommending peace, charity, and godly unity, he asked them severally whether they consented that the canonical decrees should be maintained?

It may rather be said, that the synod was called with the consent of the Saxon princes, and that to their consent Theodore was also indebted for his metropolitan dignity. It may fairly be * Camden, Britannia."], [92, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 449-800. 54 Wilfrid. But it is certain that Theodore willingly consented to his deprivation, and not contented with this act of power, that he divided the diocese of York into three portions, and erected a new see at Holy Island. concluded that the consent of the Saxon princes originated in reasons of convenience and policy, not in a belief in the right of the Roman pontiff to any supremacy over the Saxon church. But whatever were their motives, and whatever were the grounds on which the union was formed, we have in the synod of Heradford the first assembly of the Saxon church under a common metropolitan. The deprivation of Wilfrid occasioned a remarkable event in the history of the Anglo-Saxon church, namely, an appeal from the decision of the archbishop of Can terbury to the Roman pontiff. Wilfrid, accompanied by a number of his followers, repaired to Rome, at the time when Agatho I. was employed in arranging the sixth general council against the Monothelites. It is more probable that Wilfrid went thither voluntarily than that he was summoned, but it is an unquestioned fact that he presented a petition of appeal to the pontiff* It set forth the injustice of his treatment, that he had been expelled his diocese without being convicted of any crime, and that Theodore, unsanctioned by any other authority either civil or ecclesiastical, had divided the bishop ric of York, and appointed a bishop to each division. The petitioner referred himself wholly to the apostolic see, and was willing to acquiesce in its decision with all imagin able submission. Wilfrid told his wrongs with such eloquence and earnestness, that Agatho and his counsellers were of opinion that he ought to be restored to his bishopric, and if the interests of religion demanded that the see of York should be divided, yet that the coadjutor ought to be appointed by Wilfrid.} The cause being thus decided he was required to return, to show the decree of the pontiff and his council to the king of Northumbria and the archbishop of Canter bury, a command which the triumphant prelate obeyed with alacrity. Though no other terms of communion were mentioned in this synod than the Romish observance of Easter, yet it appears from the \"Penitentiale \" of Theodore, that the bishops who had been consecrated by the Scots or Britons, were not to be permitted to exercise their function without an imposi tion of hands from what he calls a Catholic bishop. This regulation, ungrateful as it must have been in itself to the British and Scottish clergy, was aggravated by the un yielding strictness with which it was enforced. Soon was his authority questioned and opposed, and he adopted the most violent measures to support it. The first who felt the effects of his displeasure was Winfrid, bishop of Lichfield, who had been conse crated by Theodore himself, and had been present at the synod of Heradford. He was deprived for nonconformity, and availing himself of the usual retirement of a monas tery, he quietly retreated and passed the remainder of his life in religious contem plation. About two years after this depri vation Wilfrid also was condemned to the same fate. His disgrace, if it may be so called, might partly arise from resistance to the authority of Theodore, but that was not the only cause. His secular pomp had long drawn on him the jealousy of the Northum brian court, and even of Ecgfrid the king; and his influence in persuading the queen consort to quit her regal state for monastic retirement had aggravated Ecgfrid's dislike into open hostility. A complaint was pre ferred to Theodore, who came by the king's desire into Northumbria to hear and judge it. Some historians have ventured to assert that the archbishop was bribed to support the interest ofthe king, and to decide against Notwithstanding that Theodore had been educated at Rome, and had owed his ad vancement entirely to the savour of the reigning pontiff; notwithstanding, also, the recent and formal union ofthe Saxon with the Romish church promoted by himself \u2014 yet * Cernwald, a monk, appeared as the advocate of Theodore. t Bede, lib. iv. c 12-19.

As for the king of Northum bria, he was so far from acquiescing that he upbraided Wilfrid for having obtained the decree by fraud or bribery. Pretending to suspect, or really suspecting, that it was an imposture, he called together his nobles and clergy to examine into its authenticity. When it was found impossible to entertain any reasonable doubts on this subject, in stead of obeying the sentence, he was advised to punish Wilfrid by imprisonment. The bishop was accordingly committed to a most severe confinement, his property was con fiscated, and his attendants were dispersed. In this miserable condition he languished nearly a year, and at length obtained his liberty, in consequence ofthe solicitation of the king's aunt, and on condition that he should never again set his foot in the king dom of Northumbria. comprising the midland counties of England, had then only two bishops; Wilfrid was in prison, and the whole number of bishops assembled could not have exceeded ten. Yet the proceedings were conducted with the greatest decorum and discretion. Not only was the heresy of the Monothelites con demned, but a permanent standard of doctrine and discipline was established for the Saxon church. The council being assembled, Theodore, who presided, delivered a sum mary of the Christian faith, as it was laid down in the Scriptures, in the Creed, and in the general councils. The bishops present having declared their unanimous assent to this exposition, proceeded to make a parti cular confession of their faith with relation to those doctrines which had been questioned or opposed by heretics, testifying the agree ment of the synod in the decisions of the Catholic church, as set forth in the first five general councils. And lest this declaration might be thought too general, or liable to evasion and misinterpretation, the synod expressed its special assent to the decrees of the council called by Pope Martin against the Monothelite heresy. Theodore having brought the synod of Hadfield to the issue which he intended, its decrees were drawn up, and signed by all the bishops present. Throughout these proceedings against Wilfrid there is the strongest evidence that the bishops of Rome possessed no acknow ledged jurisdiction over the Anglo-Saxon church ; and that the deference usually shown towards them was limited by policy and convenience. With regard to doctrine, the homology of England to the metropolis of the Western church was unreserved ; and in the heresy of the Monothelites, which at that time divided the Christian world, Theo dore appeared on the side of Rome with promptness and vigour. When we consider the depressed state of learning in his age, and the great abilities of Theodore, there cannot be any reason for wonder that Agatho should have invited him to Rome, in order to write against the prevalent heresy. Declin ing the invitation, he was not less zealous in opposing the Monothelites in the country committed to his spiritual care. With the consent of the kings of Northumbria, of Kent, and ofthe East Angles, he convened a synod at Hadfield, for the purpose of oppos ing its progress. The Christian religion being now gener ally professed throughout England, Wilfrid, who had been banished from Northumbria, employed his labours between the South and West Saxons. But Ecgfrid having been killed by the Picts, and Aldfrid his brother, who had been Wilfrid's pupil,* having suc ceeded, the ambitious prelate was inspired with a sanguine hope of regaining his former station. He had found that the authority of the bishop of Rome was little regarded in England, and therefore he prudently deter mined to show a deference to the authority of the archbishop of Canterbury, which he had formerly opposed. The services which he had rendered to the church among the The conduct of Theodore in that synod fully justified the reputation which he had obtained. The whole kingdom of Mercia, * Aldfrid is thus described by Alcuin, \" Qui sacris fuerat studiis imbutus ab annis \u00e6tatis prim\u00e6, valido sermone sophista acer et ingenio, idem ut simul atque mogister.\" \u2014 De Pont. 748."], [94, "56 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 449-800. Not contented with having drawn on him self the enmity of two princes, he engaged in a contest with Brithwald, the successor of Theodore, at the time when he most needed the protection of an ecclesiastical superior. He had been banished from the see of York almost eleven years when a council was called by Brithwald, at the suggestion of Aldfrid and Ethelred, to investigate his conduct. At first he refused to appear before the synod, being apprehensive of his personal safety; but having been promised a safe-conduct, he presented himself. His deportment was so improper that a general sentence of depri vation was pronounced by the archbishop, though the other bishops implored that the sentence might be mitigated. He was allowed therefore to return to his monastery of Ripon on condition that he would cease to exercise his episcopal functions. It was natural to expect that terms so humiliating would not only be rejected by Wilfrid, but would heighten his resentment. He pro tested vehemently against the proceedings of the synod, reproached the bishops with ingratitude, and threatened to appeal to the pope. The synod exhibited great firmness, but Aldfrid displayed a violence equal to that of Wilfrid. He even proposed to deliver the refractory prelate to summary death; but the bishops insisted on the safe conduct, and Wilfrid was permitted to de part. Old as he then was, his spirit was unbroken, and he hastened to Rome. Pre senting himself before the pope, he set forth the injustice of his treatment, and implored redress. It happened that a provincial council was at that time sitting at Rome, and two legates from Brithwald appeared before it, to vindicate the proceedings of himself and the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Wilfrid on his own behalf, and the two legates on the part of Brithwald, submitted the case to the pope in council. The chief, or rather the only accusation preferred against Wilfrid was, that he had refused to submit to the authority of an English synod. Wilfrid stated in his defence that he had never refused obedience to the archbishop South and West Saxons since his exile had softened the resentment of Theodore, and a reconciliation was sought by the primate. A conference between these two bishops took place at London, in the presence of Erconwald, bishop of that see. Theodore made the first advances, acknowledged his fault, and implored forgiveness. \" I am warned,\" he said, \" by my present age and infirmities that my death will not be long delayed ; I beseech you graciously to forgive me.\" Desirous to prove the sincerity of his contrition, he offered to resign the arch bishopric to his former rival, since he knew no one so worthy of governing the church. Nothing could be more praiseworthy than the temper which these reconciled bishops displayed. Wilfrid received the apology with candour and frankness, forgiving all past injuries and offering assurances of future friendship. To accept the archbishopric without the sanction of a general council was a thought which Wilfrid could not entertain, and he only wished to be rein stated in his bishopric of Northumbria. Theodore cheerfully wrote letters of recom mendation to Aldfrid, and to Elfrida, the king's sister: and in consequence Wilfrid was invited to return. Bosa, bishop of York, was removed to the bishopric of Holy Island, at that time vacant by the resignation of Cuthbert, and Wilfrid was appointed bishop of York. With the episcopal revenues, he also re-possessed the monasteries of Hexham and Ripon. In the year following this memorable re conciliation Theodore died, but unfortunately his death did not put an end to the turbu lence or the troubles of Wilfrid. No sooner was he placed in the see of York than he experienced opposition on every side. His contentious spirit alienated his sovereign and pupil Aldfrid, who, unable to bear his im perious temper, drove him from the see of York, and from the kingdom of Northumbria. Wilfrid sought refuge in Mercia, and obtained the bishopric of Leicester, which, however, he had not possessed long before he provoked Ethelred, king of Mercia, to banish him."], [95, "a.d. 449.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 57 of Canterbury, unless his decisions were contrary to the apostolic see. The appeal itself, as well as the defence, inclined the pope to favour Wilfrid, and he was pro nounced innocent. Instead, however, of issuing any decree, the pope wrote to the kings of Northumbria and Mercia, desir ing that a synod might be called by the archbishop, in which Wilfrid should be present ; that the bishops of York and Hexham should be summoned; that after hearing all parties they should endeavour to settle the quarrel at home, but that in case it could not be adjusted the disputants should attend at Rome, and the cause should be again referred to the pope and his council. from the apostolic see;* but the king having been shortly afterwards seized by a vio lent sickness, and thinking that his malady was a divine judgment in consequence of his disobedience to the commands of the pontiff, made a vow to restore Wilfrid in case of his recovery, and in case of his death bequeathed the performance of it on his suc cessor. After a lingering illness Aldfrid died, and his son being an infant, the crown was usurped by Eudulph. Wilfrid was well known to Eudulph, and confidently expected his immediate recall; but he was deceived, for in reply to his overtures he was sternly told that if he did not leave the kingdom of Northumbria within six days all his friends and followers should be put to death.} With this declaration in his favour it might be supposed that Wilfrid would have hastened home; but as he had once before experienced the danger of returning with a favourable determination of the pontiff, he requested that he might be permitted to remain, and to pass the short remnant of his life at Rome. This request was not granted. He was enjoined to return, under the spe cious pretext that his presence was necessary to the English church and kingdom, and he therefore took a reluctant leave, and tardily obeyed. The reign of the usurper, however, was short, and Wilfrid having some interest in the council of Osred, the lawful heir, suc ceeded in obtaining a synod to revise the proceedings against him. The place of its assembly was near the river Nidd, where Brithwald agreed to meet him. The arch bishop, after a short prayer for peace, stated the manner in which Wilfrid's cause had been determined at Rome, and read the epistles from the pontiff to the kings of Northumbria and Mercia. He avowed his own reconciliation with Wilfrid, and recom mended that the deprived bishop should be reinstated. But when the letters of Pope John were produced, and obedience to the pontiff enjoined under the penalty of degra dation, the assembled bishops appealed to the authority of their own provincial council, and refused to alter its decisions. Never theless, what they refused to do in compli ance with the commands of the Roman pontiff, they did from another motive. The Abbess Elfleda declared the vow made by her brother in his last sickness, a declara tion which was confirmed by the regent of Northumbria ; and the bishops, after first withdrawing for the purpose of deliberation, came to the following resolution : That the No sooner had he returned than he directed his application in the first place to Brith- wald, on whom he so far prevailed as to promise a revision and mitigation of the sentence of deprivation passed in the former synod. He then went to the court of the king of Mercia, and as Ethelred his foe had quitted his palace for a monastery, Cenred, the reigning prince, was not unwilling to favour his pretensions. The only obstacle remaining to his restoration was the king of Northumbria, and he sent two ecclesias- tics to Aldfrid, soliciting that he might be allowed to attend that prince with the letters and determination of the Roman pontiff. The solicitation was refused. Aldfrid, with the advice of his council, declared that he would not reverse the decisions of an Eng lish synod in consequence of any letters * \" As you choose to call it,\" was the language of Aldfrid to the two ecclesiastics.\u2014 Eddias, Vit.

[a.d. 449-800. 58 In this state stood the Anglo-Saxon church at the death of Brithwald, and such is its state as described by Bede. These bishops were subject to the jurisdiction of one metropolitan, till Egbert presided over the see of York. His brother being king of Northumbria, he took the advantage which this alliance gave him, in conjunction with personal merit, and obtained the pall, the characteristic of archiepiscopal dignity Yet though some ofthe successors of Egbert obtained the same honour, and the archi episcopal title was conferred on them, it is doubtful whether the archbishopric of York was completely settled until after the Nor man Conquest. bishop of Hexham should be removed to the see of York vacant by the death of Bosa, and that Wilfrid should have the bishopric of Hexham, together with the abbey of Rippon. Further than this they refused to go, either in compliance with the solicita tions of Elfleda and the regent, or in regard of the memory of their deceased king. Restored to a part of his honours and emoluments at the age of seventy-six, Wil frid did not long enjoy them. About four years after he repossessed the bishopric of Hexham he died at Oundle, in Northamp tonshire, an abbey of which he was the founder, and his body was removed to Rip pon, where it was buried with great funeral pomp. Notwithstanding his deprivations and exile, the magnificence of his living, and his munificent foundations, he left great wealth, which he directed to be divided into four portions. The first and largest part he bequeathed to the churches of St. Mary and St. Paul in Rome for masses to his soul, the second part he gave to the poor, the third to the monasteries which he had founded, and the fourth to his friends and servants. At the latter end of the eighth century the whole kingdom of Mercia was taken out of the archbishopric of Canterbury by Offa. That restless prince resolved to make his church as well as his kingdom independent. For that purpose he obliged his bishops to yield obedience to the see of Lichfield, the metropolis of his kingdom, and he obtained from Pope Adrian a pall for its bishop. Besides the natural inquietude and ambition of his temper, Offa had an antipathy to Lambert, the archbishop of Canterbury, and accused him to the pope of encouraging Charlemagne to make a descent on England. Whether this were a true charge is uncer tain; but not long after the separation of Mercia from the jurisdiction of the see of Canterbury, Offa invaded the kingdom of the East Angles, and subverted its ecclesi astical as well as its political government. He placed the whole kingdom under the archbishop of Lichfield;* by which means the bishops of Hereford, Worcester, and Sydnacester, in addition to the Mercian bishops of Elmham and Dunwich, became suffragans of that see. Lambert strenuously opposed the diminution of the jurisdiction of the ancient see of Canterbury; he sent several appeals to Rome, but the affair hav ing been settled by Offa and the pope, he Conjointly with the death of Wilfrid may be noticed a scheme of the Anglo-Saxon church, which subsisted independently of the Heptarchy or Octarchy, though the dio ceses were commensurate with the different sovereignties. It consisted of seventeen bishoprics under one metropolitan. Of these the kingdom of Kent had two, Canterbury and Rochester; the kingdom of the East Saxons one, the bishopric of London ; the kingdom of the East Angles was divided between the bishoprics of Dunwich and North Elmham ; the bishoprics of Winches ter and Sherborn comprehended the king dom of the West Saxons; the extensive kingdom of Mercia had not less than five bishoprics, and these were fixed at Lichfield, Leicester, Sydnacester, Worcester, and Here ford : the entire kingdom of the South Saxons was within the diocese of Scolsey; and lastly, the kingdom of Northumbria had four sees, York, Holy Island, Hexham, and * Higebert, bishop of Lichfield, was selected by Offa to be the metropolitan ; but the pall was not conferred till the time of Adulph, Higebert's successor. \u2014 Malms, sec. 15.

Its future history will be resumed hereafter, and the changes will be then described which took place in its polity before and at the Norman Conquest. Thus we have traced the establishment ofthe Anglo-Saxon church, as well as the CHAPTER II. THE ANGLO-SAXON ANNALS, FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE NINTH CENTURY TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST, A.D. 800 TO A.D. 1066. The first nine years of the reign of Egbert over Wessex were peacefully consumed in regulating the domestic government, im proving the internal condition, and increas ing the military strength of his kingdom. It was not until the expiration of this period that he entered on a successful career of ambition, which had been silently prepared by the wisdom of his policy. His earliest enterprise was the subjugation of the Cor nish Britons ; and a series of invasions, in which he repeatedly overthrew their forces in the field, and ravaged their territory with fire and sword even to the Land's End, finally compelled that unfortunate race to yield to his yoke. But the struggle, though unequal, was long and obstinately main tained; and the obscure record of a san guinary encounter between the forces of Wessex and the Britons, so late as the twenty-third year of Egbert's reign, marks the duration of a brave though fruitless resistance to the conqueror.} both, that the first accident of succession which should consign either to a disturbed or feeble administration, must infallibly give the ascendancy to the other. As long, therefore, as the sceptre of Mercia was wielded by the vigorous arm of Kenwulf, Egbert cautiously abstained from provoking a haz ardous contest. But the death of Kenwulf, the murder of his infant heir, and the subse quent disorders of a usurpation, destroyed the equilibrium between the two states, and afforded the king of Wessex an occasion, too tempting to be overlooked, for securing the preponderance of his power. His inter ference was invited by the people of East Anglia, who still thirsted to revenge the Mercian treachery, which had first murdered their young monarch, and then overthrown their independence. At their suggestion, or on their behalf, Egbert was led, in the twenty-third year of his reign, into a war against Mercia; and encountering Beorn wulf, the usurping king of that state, at Wilton, he there closed a bloody conflict by a complete victory over the Mercian army. Beornwulf sought safety in a precipitate flight; and Egbert, instead of pursuing him into Mercia, prudently avoided to provoke to extremity the warlike population of that country, and preferred to turn his arms against its more feeble tributary provinces. Detaching his son, Ethelwulf, with a strong body of forces into Kent, he at once separated both that petty kingdom and Essex from the Mercian dominion, and finally annexed them In the rival pretensions of Mercia, an effectual counterpoise had hitherto been presented to the growing power of Wessex; and the two kingdoms had so equally ad vanced in strength and importance, as to make it obvious that the ultimate struggle for the general supremacy over the Anglo- Saxon states must lie between these two. So nicely balanced were the resources of * The reader is referred on this subject to Wharton's Anglia Sacra. t Chron. Sax. pp. 69, 70. Malmsbury, p. 36."], [98, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 825. 60 both to the crown of Wessex. At the same time, by encouraging the revolt of the East Anglians, he left the Mercians to exhaust their remaining strength in unavailing efforts to reduce the insurgents to obedience. In one expedition into East Anglia, Beornwulf lost at the same time a great battle and his own life ; in a second invasion, his successor Ludecan shared a similar fate ; and Wiglaf, the ealdorman of Worcester, who next seized the Mercian crown, found his king dom reduced by this series of reverses to a condition of helpless debility.* the throne of Wessex. The submission of Mercia was followed by that of East Anglia.* By the establishment of his supremacy over these states, the dominion of Egbert was extended to the frontiers of Northumbria ; and his successful ambition could no longer brook the independence of any portion of the old Saxon Octarchy. But the dread of his arms had preceded their course ; and the Northumbrian king and chieftains meeting him at Dore beyond the Humber, offered a peaceful recognition of his superiority, and gave hostages for their fidelity. From Northumbria, Egbert next directed his power against the Cambrian Britons ; and penetrating into the remotest fastnesses of Wales, finished by carrying his triumphant arms into the Island of Anglesey. Thus victorious in every quarter of South Britain, Egbert had compelled the universal recogni tion of a paramount sovereignty; and though he never assumed the general title of king of all England, which modern writers have erroneously conferred upon him, the con temporary acknowledgment of his supremacy is sufficiently expressed in the dignity which is associated with his name, as the eighth and last Bretwalda of the Saxon Octarchy.} This was the opportunity for which Egbert had probably lain in patient expectation. By the intestine troubles which followed the death of Kenwulf, and the imprudent, or at least calamitous, enterprises of the two usurpers who succeeded him, the military power of Mercia, lately so formidable, had been completely destroyed ; and the king of Wessex chose the moment of confusion, as well as exhaustion, caused by the death of Ludecan and the accession of Wiglaf, to pour his forces into the Mercian territory. The new king, totally unable to draw together an army for the defence of his crown, or even to oppose the slightest resistance to the invaders, was only successful in eluding their pursuit. During three years he lurked a fugitive and a wanderer among the morasses and woods of his dominions ; and the feel ings of a superstitious age might not un naturally receive, as the retributive judgment of Heaven, the reverse of fortune which conducted a king of Mercia for refuge to the cell of Ethelburga, the daughter whom Offa had widowed in her marriage hour, by that same crime which the East Anglians had now deeply revenged upon his country. In her retreat at the monastery of Croyland the princess sheltered the royal fugitive for several months ; and it was by the inter cession of the abbot of that sanctuary that Egbert was at length induced to consent that Wiglaf should retain the crown of Mercia on the degrading conditions of swearing allegiance, and rendering a yearly tribute to At this epoch, however, when the genius and fortune of Egbert had prevailed over every native rival, and permanently estab lished the superiority of the throne of Wessex over all the Anglo-Saxon states, their common safety was assailed by a new and most dangerous foreign enemy. This was that ferocious race of Scandinavian pirates, whose ravages on the shores of Continental Europe have already been de scribed in the calamitous annals of the Car lovingian empire ; but who, instead of their more usual name of Northmen or Normans, are in our own history better known under the appellation of Danes. In its modern sense, at least, this last title was improperly bestowed: for not the Peninsula of Jutland and the isles of the Baltic alone, but the whole sea-coasts of the great Scandinavian continent, contributed to send forth those \u2022 Chron. Sax. p. 70. Ingulf. Hist. p. 7. * Ingulf, pp. 7, 8. t Chron. Sax. pp. 71, 72."], [99, "a.d. 787-832.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 61 piratical swarms, which inflicted in common the work of devastation upon the more southern shores of Europe. The peculiar circumstances in the internal condition of Scandinavia, which, towards the close of the eighth century, enlarged the ravages of these scourges of the North, and first precipitated their fury on the more civilized portions of Europe, would be vainly sought in the fabulous history of the regions which produced them: but, as we have formerly observed, the earliest appearance of their piratical fleets beyond their own coasts coincides in point of time with the subjugation of Northern Germany by Charle magne ; and it is highly probable that the hordes of Saxon exiles who fled before the arms of that conqueror to the shores of the Baltic, swelled the numbers of the Scandi navian pirates, and gave a new impulse to the extension of their enterprises. The coasts of England, and next of France, attracted their ravages. Their earliest re corded descent on our own country is placed in the year 787, when they landed from three ships on the Isle of Thanet, and put to the sword the Saxon governor of the district, who went out to view their strange armament.* This first apparation was fol lowed by similar desultory assaults on other parts of the coast, which served only to excite a transient alarm. But, in the thirty second year of the reign of Egbert, a fleet of the pirates in more formidable force arrived off the Kentish shores. After plun dering the Isle of Sheppey they retreated in safety ; and from this epoch, the descents of the Northmen were yearly renewed with increasing violence. In the very next summer, they landed from thirty-five vessels on the coast of Wessex itself; defeated a body of West Saxons under Egbert in person, at Charmouth, in Dorsetshire; and carried off their spoil in triumph.} These ferocious invaders, whose very name inspired horror among the more civilized Anglo-Saxons, had probably sprung from the remains of their own stock in Scandinavia. They claimed a common descent from Woden; and were certainly distinguished by similar qualities, manners, and religion with the original Saxon in vaders of Britain. Like them, the North men, spurning every pacific occupation and employment, made the stormy ocean their home, piracy and rapine their business and means of subsistence, bloodshed and fiery destruction their pleasures, and human cap tives the propitiatory sacrifices to their gods or demons. By the dim and uncertain light of the Northern legends, the common addic tion of the Northmen to a life of piratical adventure may be traced to the existence of a law or custom which the scanty produce of a stern climate and sterile soil might have rendered originally necessary, and which became so extensively prevalent as to entitle it to be considered universal throughout the Scandinavian shores. This was a rule of succession by which the younger sons of every chieftain left to their elder brother the whole patrimonial territory; received for their share of inheritance only arms and shipping ; and with such associates and followers as were disposed to join their fortune, betook themselves to a life of roving and predatory enterprise. The most suc cessful and renowned of such adventurous leaders attracted inferior chieftains to their banners by the fame of their exploits ; and without a foot of territory, without other possessions than their war-ships, or other subjects than their numerous crews, these Sea-kings or Vikingr, as they are called, rivalled national princes in power, and filled every region of Europe, which their navies could approach, with the terror of their name.* This disaster taught the Saxon monarch the necessity of systematic preparation for the repulse and chastisement of such per severing invaders ; and his measures on this lesser piratical chieftains of the north, are ably illustrated (Anglo-Saxons, b. iv. c. 1 and 2) by Mr. Sharon Turner: to whom the merit is due of being the first, among our English writers, to investigate this obscure subject. \u00ab Chron.

Assembling his nobles in council at London, he explained and concerted his arrangements for the public defence ; and though uncertain at what point to expect the next invasion, waited in anxious readiness for the event. It avouched the efficacy of his plans. For though the enemy, whether from policy or accident, chose the Cornish coast for the new scene of invasion, and persuaded the subjugated Britons to revolt and join them, he was able promptly to oppose their dangerous union with the assembled forces of Wessex ; and in a sanguinary encounter at Hengstone Hill, in Cornwall, in which he again com manded in person, he revenged his former defeat by a decisive victory; totally sup pressed the rebellion of the Britons; and after an immense slaughter, drove the re mains of their invading confederates to the refuge of their ships. With this success Egbert completed the achievements of a protracted and fortunate reign of thirty-six years, during which, equally by policy and arms, he had subdued every domestic opponent, securely establishing the para mount authority of his house over the Anglo-Saxon states, and, finally, taken a signal vengeance upon the only foreign enemies, and those the most formidable of the age, who had dared to insult his dominions. He died in 836, within twelve months after his victory, at Hengstone, full of years and glory.* father, and one ancient writer has represented him of a feeble and indolent character:* but the actions of his reign display no want of energy or courage ; and some share at least of the merit of his government may be imputed to a prince who is admitted to have selected men of vigour and ability for his ministers. These were two prelates, Alstan and Swithin, bishops of Sherborne and Winchester \u2014 the first distinguished for his martial and political activity ; and the second for more becoming attributes of pacific wis dom. The exigencies of the times, indeed, were such as to demand rather the stirring qualities of a warlike spirit, than the milder virtues of cloistered or even of civil life; and the talents of Alstan are said to have been beneficially exercised in providing financial supplies, and establishing a permanent mili tary array ofthe people, for the public defence against the invasion ofthe Northmen.} These were now becoming so incessant on all points of the coast that, for effectually repelling them, it was found necessary to adopt the expedient of appointing royal offi cers in every maritime district to assemble and lead the inhabitants against the common enemy, in whatever quarter they should attempt to land. Their piratical swarms hovered in fact over the whole extent of the English shore from Northumbria to Wessex, and harassed the island with desultory assaults. It was their custom, each summer after landing and desolating the country, to return home laden with spoil before the winter, and to renew their depredations upon some other part of the coast in the following season. In the year after Ethelwulf s acces sion, his immediate territories alone were simultaneously invaded in three quarters, from as many squadrons, with various suc cess. In the ensuing spring, a more numer ous body of Northmen made a descent upon East Anglia, and after defeating the ealdor man of the district, penetrated southward to the Thames before they retired. In the following campaign the progress of these Egbert was succeeded by his son Ethel wulf, who is said to have been destined, during the life of an elder brother, to the monastic profession. He assumed only the crown of Wessex, and the general supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon states ; while the con quered provinces of Kent and Essex were united into a subordinate kingdom under Athelstan, who was either (and it is uncer tain which) his son or his brother. The genius of Ethelwulf was inferior to that of his * Malmsbury, p. 37. Idem, De Gest. Pontif. p. 247. f Chron. Sax. p. 73. * Chrou. Sax. pp. 72, 73. Ingulf, p. 10."], [101, "a.d. 838-849. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 63 merciless invaders was marked by four obstinate and bloody encounters ; and though in one of these actions Ethelwulf himself was defeated at Charmouth, the successes of the Northmen were followed by an almost total cessation of their enterprises, so far as England was concerned, for the next twelve years. This interval was occupied, as we have seen, by a series of ravages on the coasts of France : in which, encountering a less determined resistance, or allured by a richer booty, they successively sacked Rouen, Paris, Bordeaux, and other principal cities of that kingdom. But at length they again assaulted England by so many simultaneous invasions, and in such formidable numbers, as seemed to indicate a concerted design of general and durable conquest. The unusual operations of one army which, debarking in the Isle of Thanet, there for the first time ventured to winter in England instead of returning to their own country, might well awaken the gloomiest apprehensions of the Saxons, who remembered that the district thus occupied by pagan enemies of the same race with themselves, had also been the ear liest permanent settlement of their common progenitors. * wulf himself, and his son Ethelbald, at the head of the assembled forces of Wessex, now awaited their approach. At Aclea, or the Field of Oaks in that county, the two armies met in a long and deadly struggle; at the close of which the Saxons prevailed with so dreadful a slaughter of the invaders, that their loss is declared by a chronicler of the next age to have exceeded any which they had before or since sustained. Nor was this the only triumph of a season which became emphatically distinguished, from the subse quent disasters of the Saxon annals, as the happy or fortunate year. At Wenbury, the ealdorman of Devonshire had inflicted a decisive defeat upon another body of the Northmen ; and on the coast of Kent, King Athelstan routed a third army of invaders, and captured nine of their ships. Discour aged by so many repulses, the Northmen abandoned their hopes of conquest ; and aster a single predatory descent in the follow ing year, they desisted during the remainder of Ethelwulf's reign from further assaults upon the shores of England. * No other warlike achievements distin guished the life of this prince, if we except a successful expedition into Wales, which he undertook, after the expulsion of the Northmen, to assist his tributary, the king of Mercia, in punishing the Britons for some incursions into that state, and compelling them to recognize its superiority.} The domestic circumstances of Ethelwulf's reign, however, are invested with a superior interest from their connection with the youthful fortunes of his fourth son, the illustrious Alfred, who was born at Wantage, in Berk shire, in the year 849. The indications of a superior nature, which are said to have appeared even in his childhood, or some less excusable caprice of parental fondness, rendered him the best-beloved son of Ethel wulf; and there is evidence of his father's early design to prefer him in the succession to the throne before his elder brothers. It could be with no other purpose that the king Accordingly, the imminence ofthe danger seems to have roused all the Anglo-Saxon states of the south to a sense of the necessity of united efforts for expelling the invaders. A general congress of the nobles and prelates of Wessex and Mercia was therefore held at Kingsbury, in Oxfordshire, at which mea sures were concerted for the public defence. These were soon called into action, for the en suing spring witnessed the most tremendous invasion which had yet afflicted the island. A fleet of no less than three hundred and fifty sail entered the Thames ; and the North men disembarking from their vessels, sacked both London and Canterbury, before Bertulf, king of Mercia, to whom the defence of that part of the country had been allotted, could march to its relief. He arrived only to encounter a total defeat; and the victorious invaders advanced into Surrey, where Ethel- * Chron. Sax. pp. 74, 75. Ingulf, p. 11. Asser, pp. 5, 6. t Chron. Sax. p. 75.

The malcontents included many of the West Saxon thanes; and Alstan himself, the famous bishop of Sherborne and minister of Ethelwulf, to gether with the ealdorman of Somerset, were the principal advisers of the young prince. Assembling their forces in the forest of Sel wood, the conspirators prepared, with Ethel bald at their head, to complete their project; when the arrival of Ethelwulf in England arrested its consummation. His appearance recalled the waning affections of his subjects; the greater number of the nobles and people of Wessex, though displeased at his absence and marriage, were still more shocked at the wicked violation of filial duty in Ethelbald ; and the division of feeling threatened the state with the calamities of a civil war be tween the father and son. The mild dispo sition of the old king, his desire of repose, or perhaps his fears, induced him to avert this catastrophe by a compromise with the revolters. He consented to abandon the crown of Wessex, with only a nominal reser vation of his own supremacy, to his rebellious son ; and he was satisfied with retaining under his immediate administration the east ern dependencies ofthe monarchy, consisting of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Essex, which Athelstan, who was now dead, had formerly governed with a subordinate royal title. Ethelwulf survived this accommodation only two years; and by his will bequeathing this eastern kingdom to Ethelbert (857), his second son, he directed that the third and fourth, Ethelred and Alfred, should severally succeed Ethelbald, in the order of seniority, on the throne of Wessex.* sent him, when only five years old, to Rome in charge of the bishop of Winchester, with a request that the pope would solemnly bestow the regal unction upon him ; and this ceremony, which was evidently intended to establish the royal dignity in his person by a sacred and inviolable authority, was accordingly performed by the reigning pon tiff Leo IV.* Two years later, the tran quillity in which his dominions had been left by the cessation of the Northman invasions, induced Ethelwulf himself to gratify the same pious impulse which, according to the mistaken ideas of the times, had led so many earlier Saxon princes to undertake the pil grimage to Rome. In this expedition, also, he led Alfred with him to revisit the papal capital ; and crossing through France, where he was royally entertained by Charles the Bald, he performed the long and toilsome journey in safety. On his return, a second visit to the Frankish monarch produced the disproportioned union ofthe aged Ethelwulf with Judith, the youthful daughter of his royal host ; and immediately after their nup tials, the princess, being crowned as queen with great ceremony by the archbishop of Rheims, accompanied her husband to Eng land.} This foreign journey of Ethelwulf proved in every respect injurious to the peace of his kingdom. The preference which he showed to his youngest son had excited the jealousy of the eldest, Ethelbald, whose temper was violent and ambitious ; the absence of the king favoured the unnatural machinations into which the prince entered to seize his crown ; and, above all, the West Saxons were filled with discontent at the elevation of Judith to a participation in the regal dignity, which by the law passed, as we have formerly recorded, in consequence of the crimes of Eadburga, was denied to the con sorts of their monarchs. Favoured by the general disgust at this measure, Ethelbald, before his father's return, had succeeded in Ethelwulf was no sooner dead than Ethel bald, who had been loudest in reprobating his father's marriage with Judith, himself espoused his blooming stepmother. This incestuous union, which deservedly excited the indignation and horror of his subjects, is the only recorded event of his brief reign. By the spiritual admonition of Swithin, bishop of Winchester, or the menaces of his * Chron. Sax. pp 76. 77. Asser, De Gestis Elfredi, pp. 3, 7. f Asser, pp. 8, 9.

On his demise, the crown of Wes sex should by the paternal testament have devolved upon Ethelred, the third of the brothers : but the second, Ethelbert, already king of Kent, now asserted his prior title, and easily obtaining its recognition by the witenagemote of Wessex, united the whole inheritance of Egbert in his person. He en joyed it but six years; and his reign, though his warlike qualities are praised in general terms by the chroniclers of the age, appears to have been as undistinguished as that of his immediate predecessor, except by one disastrous circumstance \u2014 the renewal ofthe Northman descents on England. * red, his next brother, ascended the throne of Wessex under his father's will, although the late king had lest several children. His accession-was immediately followed by a new and a more appalling than any preceding descent of the Northmen : of which the par ticular origin has been sought, and perhaps discovered, in the wildest legends of Scan dinavia. According to them, this expedition was undertaken on a vow of filial vengeance by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrog, one of the most famous sea-kings of the age. We gather, indeed, from authentic history, that shortly previous to the epoch before us this bold leader of the Northmen, ascending the Seine with his piratical squadron, spreading flames and devastation along its banks, and obliging Charles the Bald to save Paris by ransom from sharing the same fate, had already rendered his name terribly familiar in France.* That he had now, twenty years later, perished in a descent on the coast of England, is obscurely intimated by the Saxon chroniclers. } Ofthe actions and fate of this renowned sea-king, so much only is certain ; but if we receive the tale of Scandinavian romance, having been shipwrecked in a pred atory expedition on the coast of Northum bria, he was made captive, and by order of Ella, king of that country, consigned to a dungeon filled with vipers, until he was stung to death. In his Quida, or Death song, as it has been believed,} he alleviated In the fifth year after his accession to the throne of Wessex, Winchester, the ancient capital of that kingdom, was sacked and burned to the ground by an army of these invaders; who, however, in retreating with their booty to their vessels at Southampton, were overtaken and routed with retributive slaughter by the forces of Berkshire and Hampshire, under their respective ealdor men. In the same year, another piratical squadron, assailing the Kentish coast, re peated with impunity the experiment of wintering in the Isle of Thanet ; and the inhabitants of Kent, instead of vigorously attempting to repel them, gave the first fatal and shameful example of purchasing their retreat by gold. But the credulity and cowardice of these degenerate \" Men of Kent \" were only derided by the perfidious barbarians ; who, after receiving the price of forbearance, broke from their maritime camp into the province, and plundered and deso lated all the eastern parts of it. At the same time another fleet appeared off the Northum brian shore ; and, from thence southward, the whole coast was again menaced with a gathering storm of invasion. * Chron. Fontanel. p. 41 (in the great Benedictine Collec tion, vol. vii.). So also Vezel, p. 271 ; Aimon, p. 350, &c. f Brompton, p. 802. Matthew Westminster, p. 314. &c. X Although an English translation of the Lodbroker Quida, or supposed death-song of Lodbrog, appeared half a century ago, to Mr. Turner, as we have already observed, belongs the credit of the first attempt to connect that and other traditions of Scandinavian romance with our genuine Anglo-Saxon his tory. But it is necessary to receive the evidence of such wild Northern legends with great suspicion. Though the Quida is probably a production of high antiquity, it is impossible to ascertain its exact age. As the composition of Ragnar him self, it would seem almost needless to remark that it cannot be authentic; yet it is strange that the obvious and puerile absurdity of attributing it to that chieftain has passed without comment. If sung in his solitary dungeon, how was it heard and preserved ? The mode of his death is as plainly fabulous or allegorical; and the only value of the poem consists in the probability that it was composed by some Northern scald or bard soon after the event of which it is the subject. As such, it would illustrate the origin of the invasion conducted by his sons in a natural motive of vengeance ; and it is at least a very spirited ode, and a curious picture of Scandinavian senti ments and manners. On the death of Ethelbert (866), amidst this ominous and cheerless prospect, Ethel- * Asser, pp. 14, 15. Chron Sax p. 78.

Some of his sons, who were in Scandinavia when the intelligence of his fate reached them, swore to inflict a signal vengeance on the land of his murderers ; and the numerous adherents and admirers of a chieftain whose exploits had rendered him so illustrious sympathized in the stern emotions, and embraced the sanguinary resolve of his children. A formidable arma ment, in which were eight sea-kings, and twenty jarls or earls of the Northmen, all relations or associates of Ragnar, was rapidly assembled under the chief command of five of his sons, Ingwar, Halfden, Bacseg, Guth run, and Ubba; and in the year after his death, the whole navy of destruction, con veying twenty thousand warriors, steered for the English shores. Being by stress of weather, or whatever other cause, carried beyond the Northumbrian coast, the fleet first made the land of East Anglia. In the spring the invading host, aban doning East Anglia, burst in their vengeful career upon Northumbria ; fresh from the grim repose of their winter's camp ; led by the ruthless sons of Ragnar ; and guided by the Raven, or enchanted banner, which his daughters were believed to have woven in a single noontide, and which derived its name from the sacred bird of Woden, depicted on its texture. They had already possessed themselves of York before the rivals, Ella and Osbert, awakening too late to the danger of their country, and agreeing to suspend the settlement of their opposing claims, marched with united forces to surprise them in their quarters near that city. In their sudden and furious assault the North umbrian princes were at first successful ; the Northmen were driven into the place for refuge ; a passage through the city walls was forced ; and the death struggle was renewed in the streets. But here the desperation of the invaders, to whom the power of flight was denied, prevailed over the ardour of their assailants. Aster an obstinate conflict the latter were repulsed ; Osbert himself was slain ; and the North umbrians were finally routed with a mer ciless slaughter. The fate of Ella was less happy than that of his rival ; he survived the defeat only to fall alive into the hands of the victors ; and the sons of Ragnar are said to have inflicted an agonizing death upon the slayer of their father. They divided and stretched open his ribs from the spine, drew out the lungs, and strewed salt upon the quivering members.} This mode of execution, termed the Spread Eagle, from the similarity of the victim's appear ance to the figure of that bird, was not With the descent of the ferocious host on that province, we recover the thread of genuine history. Though they encountered no opposition on their landing, they did not at once advance into the country, but con tented themselves with fortifying a camp, in which they determined to pass the winter. This season of repose was occupied in col lecting horses for their warriors ; in still further swelling their numbers by reinforce ments from Scandinavia ; and in gaining over to their alliance some of the nobles of Northumbria. Their designs in this latter respect were suggested and promoted by the state of that kingdom. For having thrown off the dependence upon Wessex, to which Egbert had subjected it, the whole province was now distracted by the rival pretensions of two claimants, Osbert and Ella, to its independent and ancient crown. If the Saxon states at this fatal juncture had cor dially united against the invaders, the latter might have been overpowered ; but the East Anglians, from fear or selfish blind- * Asser, pp. 15, 18. t Saxo Gramnmticus, Hist. Dan. p. 177."], [105, "a.d. 867-S7L] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 67 uncommonly practised among the North men upon enemies who had signally pro voked their hate. The performance of the operation was the privilege of the sea-king or other chieftain ; * and this atrocious cus tom, like the tortures inflicted by the Indian warriors of North America, marks the fiendlike and wanton excess of cruelty, of which human nature in its savage state is capable. This shocking catastrophe put a period to the Anglo-Saxon dynasty of Northumbria ; for the conquerors, after per mitting the ephemeral and tributary reigns of three native chieftains, seized the country in full occupation. Ingwar, the son of Ragnar, was raised by his followers to its sovereignty ; and Northumbria thenceforth became permanently a Northman or Danish principality.} the scene of attack, poured into Lincoln shire. All the unspeakable horrors of fire and pillage, bloodshed and violation, attended their destroying course. A heroic but un availing defence was here made by the brave ealdorman Algar, and the youth of the country ; for, being unsupported by their king, they were overwhelmed by the num bers of the Northmen and slaughtered to a man. Some of the most famous and most opulent of the Saxon monasteries, situated in this part of England \u2014 Bardeney, Croyland, Medeshamstede (the modern Peterborough), and Ely \u2014 were successively pillaged and burnt ; and the religious of both sexes were murdered, after undergoing every atrocity, by these inhuman pagans.* They next entered East Anglia. Edmund the king of that country, the memory of whose pious and gentle virtues was long consecrated in the hearts of his people, but who appears to have wanted the more ener getic qualities which the crisis demanded, either attempted no resistance, or resisted ineffectually. Falling into the hands of the barbarians, and steadfastly refusing, as it is said, obedience to the command of their leader to renounce his Christian faith, he was tortured to death. His remains were privately interred by some faithful domestics; a splendid monastery was in a later age erected over his tomb ; and the modern town of St. Edmund's Bury still marks the place of his sepulture and preserves the name of the canonized martyr. A single winter sufficed to establish the Northmen in their new conquests ; the throne of St. Edmund was occupied by Guthrun, another of the sons of Ragnar ; and East Anglia was converted from this epoch into the second Danish kingdom in England.} Aster this decisive victory the invaders proceeded to execute the plan which they had now evidently formed for the general and durable conquest of the island ; nor were their designs wanting in a more regular and systematic policy than had hitherto characterized their predatory and transient descents. Whilst one division of their army remained under Ingwar to occupy Northumbria, their principal force, pass ing the Humber, advanced southward into Mercia and took possession of Nottingham. The Mercian king, Burrhed, then imploring the succour of Wessex, Ethelred, with his brother Alfred and the forces of the para mount Saxon kingdom, marched to his aid, and succeeded for a time in repelling the progress of the invaders. But they, full of the fierce energy of conquest, were united and persevering ; the Saxon powers, from whatever cause, seem to have been at this epoch incapable of an earnest and sincere confederation, and suffered themselves to be overpowered in succession without any hearty and combined effort for their com mon defence. After a deceitful appearance of inaction, the host of the Northmen, again advancing from the Humber, but varying But the remaining sons of Ragnar and their followers were still unprovided with English settlements ; and in the following summer, pursuing their projects of spolia tion, these chieftains led their ferocious bands into Wessex, penetrated to Reading, * Asser, pp. 19, 20.

Sax. p. 79."], [106, "\"a.d. 867-871. 68 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. this, reinforced by the junction of a fresh army which had recently landed from the Baltic. It is useless to particularize the encounters which followed ; and sufficient to record that, in a general conflict of doubtful issue at Morton in Berkshire, Ethelred, who, though too tardily, had in the close of his reign exhibited the spirit of a hero, and sustained the sinking fortunes of his kingdom with a courage worthy of a happier fate, received his mortal wound. He survived the battle only a few days ; and the invaders withdrew to Reading to rejoice over his death and to revel in their spoils.* and surprising that place, began to intrench themselves in the vicinity. Their superi ority, indeed, to the Saxons in the art of war, however rude was still their knowledge of its elements, is remarkably evinced throughout the history of these invasions. No sooner had they obtained possession of the important post of Reading, than they proceeded to strengthen their position by a line of works connecting the Thames and the Kennet. Their labours were interrupted by the assaults of the ealdorman Ethelwulf at the head of the armed population of the district ; and in the skirmishes which ensued the Saxons gained the advantage. The king of Wessex was now at last startled to the conviction that no alternative remained for him but to expel the invaders or perish in the struggle ; and summoning the whole force of his kingdom to his aid, he approached with his brother Alfred to encounter their power. Elated with the partial success which they had recently obtained, the Saxons made a bold and vigorous assault upon the Danish intrenchments ; but they were repulsed with great slaughter. A few days later, at a place in the same vicinity, termed by the Saxon chroniclers \u00c6scesdun, of which the exact position has been much controverted, the two armies came to a more open and equal encounter. In the outset the safety of the Saxons was endangered by the fiery impetuosity of Alfred, and the superior skill of the Northman array ; but the seasonable advance of Ethelred with the main body of his host turned the scale of victory. After a long and dreadful con flict the Northmen gave way ; one of their kings, Bacseg, a son of Ragnar, several jarls, and a multitude of warriors, were slain in the battle and pursuit, which reached to the gates of Reading ; and the dearly bought victory of the Saxons was purchased by a scarcely inferior loss. But even this success proved unavailing ; for it was counter balanced by a defeat which the Saxons sustained at Basing, before a fortnight had expired since their victory ; and the North men were further, almost immediately after At such a dismal epoch and by such a catastrophe was it, that the broken sceptre of Wessex devolved upon a prince who, of all monarchs in a half-civilized state of society, has perhaps best deserved that distinctive appellation of the Great, which history has linked to his name. Either despairing of the fortunes of his afflicted country, or influenced by the more com mendable distrust, which his friend and biographer has attributed to him, of his own sufficiency for the arduous duties of the regal office, without the special aid of Providence, Alfred, then only in his twenty second year, first hesitated to accept the vacant throne. But he was summoned to the perilous station by the unanimous entreaties of the nobles and people of Wes sex, to whom the reputation of his talents and valour had already endeared him ; the sense of public duty, or of gratitude for the public confidence, prevailed over his feelings of despondency, and he suffered the crown to be placed on his head by the archbishop of Canterbury.} The aspect of affairs was indeed such as might rationally excite the worst apprehen sions. An enemy, whose superior martial skill and activity were rendered more appalling by their merciless ferocity, had already securely established themselves in \u2022 Asser, pp. 21, 24. Chron. Sax. pp. 80, 81. t Asser, p. 24. Simon Dunelm, pp. 126, 127. Ingulf. p. 25."], [107, "a.d. 871-875. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 69 the island with overwhelming numbers ; and continual reinforcements of new swarms from their northern seats, rendered their repeated defeat unavailing, and their ulti mate expulsion hopeless. Conducting their operations with a systematic policy, of which their leaders never lost sight, even whilst the wildest and most horrid devasta tion marked their course, the invaders had already subjugated two of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Northumbria and East Anglia ; insulted, overawed, and paralyzed the power of a third, Mercia ; and penetrated into the heart of the predominant monarchy of Wessex. Consolidating their conquests, as they proceeded, into durable occupation, they had expanded their possessions in one unbroken line over all the eastern part of the island from the Tyne to the Thames, and were in fact masters of one half of Saxon England. The conflict had now in fact become a national struggle between the Northman and Saxon, as it had formerly been between the latter and the Briton, for the dominion of the whole land. Not mere detached bands of pirates, but whole races of men, with their women and children, had again, at the distance of four centuries, precipitated themselves from the Scandi navian upon the British shores. The rapa cious passion for transient plunder had been superseded in the Northern mind by the steady desire of permanent settlement, under a climate and on a soil more inviting and plentiful than their own bleak and hungry regions ; and thenceforth nothing less than the total seizure and subjugation of England could satiate the cupidity of the new Scan dinavian immigration.* ing, had penetrated into Wiltshire ; and intrenching themselves, according to their practice, on the heights above the Willy, they extended their ravages along the fertile banks of that stream. Alfred met them with inferior numbers ; and after a gallant, and for some time successful effort, to com pensate for want of strength by the vigour of his attack, was ultimately defeated. This was the ninth general action, besides in numerable skirmishes, in which the West Saxons had encountered the invaders since the commencement of the year. It was followed by a hollow pacification. The Northmen, arrested by the obstinacy of the defence, might deem it their interest to temporize ; Alfred, his kingdom exhausted by so many sanguinary conflicts, and him self discouraged by so many unavailing exer tions, might find it necessary to afford his harassed people a season of repose : and these motives probably induced him to offer, and the invaders to accept, a sum of gold as the price of their retreat from his dominions.* The dangerous, as well as disgraceful, character of this policy on the part of the Saxons, was immediately visible. The invading host withdrew only to London ; where having wintered and concentrated their forces, their leaders prepared to com plete the subjugation of Mercia. Burrhed, who still reigned over that kingdom, instead of opposing them courageously in arms, followed only the weaker part of Alfred's conduct, by negotiating and twice purchas ing a peace from the most barbarous and faithless of enemies. After receiving his second donative of gold, the Northmen threw off the mask ; made jest of his reli ance on their promises ; and perfidiously entering Mercia, ravaged the whole country with sire and sword. The pusillanimous Burrhed, now hopeless of purchasing their forbearance, knew no other alternative than flight; and disgracefully abandoning his throne and his people he escaped over sea, made the usual pilgrimage to Rome, and ended his worthless existence in that city. If Alfred had assumed the crown of his fathers with reluctance, he prepared not the less to defend it with vigour. Almost immediately after the interment of his brother, his presence was demanded in the field to resist the progress of invasion. The main army of the Northmen, whose numbers were again reinforced by a new debarkation of their countrymen, advancing from Read- * Turner, vol. ii. p 97. * Asser, p. 25. Chron.

With him passed away another of the fleeting dynasties of the Anglo-Saxons ; and the Northmen committed the temporary charge of his sceptre to Ceolwulf, one of his thanes, who had the baseness to receive it upon the ignominious condition of tribute. He was permitted to hold it only so long as his cruelty and violence could wring sufficient gold from his wretched people to satisfy the craving of his masters. When he had ex hausted every expedient of tyranny to gratify their rapacity, this pageant of royalty was overthrown; and the despicable traitor to his own honour and that of his country, being unceremoniously deposed, received a cruel death from the hands of the barbarians, who had mocked his cupidity with the gift of a crown. From this epoch Mercia, as a separate kingdom, existed no more ; but following the fortune of conquest, first sank into subjection to the Danish power, and was ultimately annexed to the West Saxon dominions.* up from their quarters at Cambridge, made a rapid embarkation on the eastern shore, and were heard of no more, until their appearance in the Channel revealed their purpose of invading Wessex anew. Landing on the coast of Dorsetshire, they surprised the strong fortress of Wareham, and, as usual, intrenched themselves so formidably in their position, that Alfred, who, hastily assembling an army, had advanced to repel their descent, found the attempt to dislodge them impracticable. Despairing of success by arms, he had again recourse to negotia tion; and on the receipt of a large sum of money, Guthrun agreed to evacuate Wessex. The experience of their perfidy to the imbe cile sovereign of Mercia, which should have deterred Alfred from all compromise with the barbarians, only actuated him to show his distrust of their faith. For the observa tion of the treaty he desired an exchange of hostages; he required the oaths of their leaders upon their bracelets, the most sacred pledge which a Northman could offer; and he had the simplicity to believe that he should exact an additional security by induc ing them to swear also upon the relics of Christian saints. The perfidious pagans, regardless alike of all obligations, readily complied with each of these demands; but no sooner was Alfred, in the confidence that he had now effectually bound them to depart, thrown off his guard, than a detach ment of their army, sallying by night from their camp, surprised his cavalry, mounted themselves on the captured horses, and by a rapid march obtained possession of Exeter, before he had leisure to recover from his astonishment or intercept their movements* By the subjugation of Mercia the North men divided the possession of all England south of the Tyne with the only remaining Saxon state of Wessex. Their measures were now directed to complete the conquest of the island. For this purpose they separated their forces into two armies. One, under Halfden their Northumbrian king, return ing by sea to that province, landed on the northern bank of the Tyne, and extended its devastating career over every part of Deira, which had yet escaped their visitation. From thence penetrating into the territories of the Cumbrian, or Strathclyde Britons, of the Picts, and of the Scots, Idalfden filled all those regions with the terror of his victorious arms ; and then, withdrawing into Northum bria, divided the conquered lands among his followers, and induced them permanently to occupy and cultivate the country which they had previously desolated, f Meanwhile, the main host of the Northmen, under Guthrun, their East Anglian king, after one of their deceitful periods of inaction, suddenly broke The disgrace of having suffered himself to be thus duped by the Northmen, seems for a time to have stimulated Alfred to more energetic exertions.

Some advantage which this squa dron obtained in an encounter with a small fleet of the Northmen, encouraged him to extend his plan ; long war-galleys were built in all his ports; and though unable to force the enemy from their posts either at Ware ham or Exeter, he now found himself in a situation to combat them successfully on the sea. The fleet of the invaders, on its passage down the Channel, encountered a violent tempest, which wrecked or disabled half its number of vessels ; the remainder were furi ously attacked and signally defeated by the Saxon squadron ; and, by the previous storm and in the battle, the Northmen lost no fewer than one hundred and twenty sail. These disasters induced Guthrun to temporize again over proposals of peace, which Alfred had the infatuation once more to entertain. Similar interchange of hostages was made, similar oaths were repeated, a similar treaty was concluded as before. But on this occa sion the Northman king, finding it necessary to suspend his designs, withdrew with his army from the territory of Wessex; and, crossing from Exeter into Mercia, fixed his quarters on the frontiers of the latter province at Gloucester and its vicinity. There appear ing desirous only of peacefully settling with his followers, he divided lands among them ; and by this new artifice succeeded in lulling Alfred into a delusive and fatal security.* escape, almost unattended, before they entered his palace at Chippenham; and without a battle, without even a recorded effort to assemble his forces, or to resist the progress of the invaders, we find him a deserted and wandering fugitive through his own dominions. In the expressive words of the Saxon Chronicle, the Danish host rode over the West Saxon land, and therein seated themselves; much of the people they drove over sea, and the rest they put in subjection, save only King Alfred ; and he with a little band went uneasily to the woods and fast nesses of the wilds.* The place in which, after a temporary dismissal of his few fol lowers, he found a secure concealment, was in the heart of Somersetshire, where a morass, formed by the confluence of the Parret and Thone, surrounded about two acres of dry land, which became afterwards celebrated under the name of Ethelingey, or the Prince's Island. Here, alone and dis guised, he was sheltered in the cabin of a poor cowherd, who, in ignorance of his real dignity, was taught to believe him at most some fugitive thane; and a picture, at once lively and affecting, of the condition to which he was reduced is preserved in the well-known and authentic ancedote \u2014 for he himself delighted to relate it in happier hours f \u2014 of the chiding which he patiently received from the herdsman's shrewish wife for suffering her cakes to be burned. To this retreat he gradually summoned a few of his most faithful retainers, fortified its only accessible point of approach; and began to make successful excursions upon straggling parties of the Northmen. While the enemy were ignorant of the quarter from which they proceeded, these enterprises revealed his existence to his own subjects, revived their despairing spirits, and awakened their native courage. But the first sure ray of The success of the Northman's wily policy is the least intelligible circumstance in the jeign of Alfred, and equally difficult to be reconciled with the preceding and subse quent activity by which his government was characterized. The unusual season which Guthrun selected for his next attack seems to offer the only rational explanation of its results: for, contrary to the custom of the Northmen, it was made in the depth of winter. Early in January (878), Guth run and his host suddenly sprang from their perfidious repose on the frontiers of Wessex, and poured like a deluge into the kingdom. Alfred was so totally unprepared for their approach that he had barely time to * Chron. Sax. p. 84. f Asser, pp. 30, 31. It is pleasing to record a circumstance which is not always appended to this tale by our historians, that Alfred subsequently evinced his gratitude in a very munificent manner to the poor herdsman who had sheltered him. For, observing his capacity to be good, the king caused him to be instructed in letters, placed him in the church, and ultimately bestowed the See of Winchester upon him. Malms bury, p. 242. Chron.

About four months had elapsed since the invasion of the principal army under Guthrun, when another division of Northmen, landing under the ferocious Ubba in Devonshire, laid siege to the castle of Kynwith, into which the brave ealdorman Odun, with a few thanes, had hastily thrown themselves. In a des perate sally the Saxon garrison succeeded in surprising the camp of the Northmen ; and slaying Ubba himself, they struck such terror into his followers, that they were routed with great slaughter, and left their enchanted standard, the Raven of Woden, in the hands of the victors.* with merciless slaughter to a strong camp which they had entrenched in the vicinity: but here Alfred, instead of rashly venturing to provoke their despair by an assault, sur rounded them in their works, threw up lines to prevent their egress, and with patient vigilance awaited the sure effect of hunger and weakness. On the fourteenth day of the blockade, the remains of the Northmen host were reduced to extremity, and Guthrun made an offer of capitulation. We may believe that the last vicissitude of fortune had completely humbled his ambition, and disgusted him from further projects of rapine or conquest; for he readily subscribed and faithfully observed the conditions of peace which Alfred dictated. He consented, for himself and his principal chieftains, to embrace Christianity ; and the new con verts were accordingly baptized with much solemnity, Alfred himself becoming their sponsor. He agreed to evacuate Wessex, and left hostages for his fidelity, without receiving any in return; and he finally retired, after some amicable intercourse with his conqueror, to his own kingdom of East Anglia. Two subsequent treaties, which are still extant, were concluded between him and Alfred to define the limits of their respective states, and perpetuate the late pacification. The boundary between the Saxon and Danish possessions was traced by the course of the Thames, the Lea, the old Roman road of Watling Street, and the Ouse. By this division Mercia was thus surrendered to Alfred: but East Anglia, including Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cam bridgeshire, and parts of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, was assigned to Guthrun and his followers ; and all this portion of Eng land, together with the old kingdom of Northumbria, being henceforth possessed and gradually filled by a population of Northmen, was contra-distinguished from the Saxon provinces, under the general term of the Danelagh, or territory subject to the Danish law.* Alfred hailed the intelligence of this suc cess as the signal for issuing from his retreat, and placing himself at the head of his sub jects, who from all sides were now eagerly awaiting their hour of vengeance against the invaders. The summons which he privately circulated received a ready obedience ; and great numbers of the men of three counties, Somerset, Wilts, and Hants, met him in arms at the appointed place of assembly \u2014 the \" Stone of Egbert,\" on the Eastern confines of Selwood Forest. His presence among his subjects was welcomed with their enthusiastic acclamations ; his gather ing force was hourly swelled by new arrivals ; and emerging from the forest, the Saxon army once more displayed the royal standard of Wessex with the confidence of victory. By the appearance of Alfred in the field, the host of the Northmen were startled from their dream of conquest. But Guthrun was an antagonist too wily to be surprised, f and concentrating his forces, he rapidly advanced to encounter his enemy. At Eddendune, near Westbury, the two armies engaged in a general and furious conflict, which termi nated in the total overthrow of the North men. They were pursued by the Saxons * Asser, pp. 30, 32. Chron. Sax. p. 84. t The oft-repeated tale that Alfred visited the camp of the Northmen disguised as a harper, and observing their careless security, afterwards fell upon them by surprise, rests only on the authority of Ingulfus (who did not live until a century later), and is unmentiuned by Asser, who must have heard the story from his royal master if it had been true, and could not have failed to relate so remarkable an occurrence if he * Asser, p. 35.

He had recovered his patrimonial dominions of Wessex and Kent, and acquired the full sovereignty of Mercia, which he committed to the immediate government of his daughter Ethelfleda and her husband, the ealdorman Ethelred. The Danes of East Anglia and Northumbria, nominally at least, recognized his general supremacy; and even the British princes of Wales, exhausted by their incessant feuds with each other, were glad to terminate their struggle for ascendancy by placing them selves under his protection, and acknow ledging their common allegiance to his throne.* He had thus acquired a more signal pre-eminence over all the states of the island than had been enjoyed by his grandsire Egbert ; and he employed his power even more honourably, in promoting the security, happiness, and civilization of his people \u2014 in organizing the means of national defence and public order, in improving both the construction and the administration of the laws, and, above all, in the restoration and encouragement of learning and piety. of the Northmen ; and to encourage the improvement of his mariners by his own presence, often led his squadrons in the cruises against the pirates in which he con tinually employed them for the security of the coast. Nor did he suffer his people to depend only for their defence upon his maritime fortresses and navy; for the whole male population of every province were enrolled into a militia, of which by rotation one-half was always held in readiness, under their ealdorman, to march to any part of the coast which might be threatened with attack, while the other moiety remained to cultivate the soil.* The restoration of internal order in the state, out of the universal confusion and ruin into which the ravages of the Northmen had broken the whole frame of civil government, was even a more difficult task than to organ ize a system of defence against external enemies. Wherever the Northmen had penetrated the tribunals had been over thrown; all legal restraints were dissolved; and the retreat of the invaders left the natives almost as fierce, barbarous, and lawless as themselves. Alfred hastened to reclaim them to habits of peace and subordination, by re-establishing the regular courts of judi cature ; and he laboured incessantly not only to secure the enforcement, but to purify the administration of justice. Many of the judges whom he found in office were ignor ant, tyrannical, and corrupt; but the readi ness with which the king received appeals from their courts, and the close attention with which he scrutinized their judgments, soon taught them that they could no longer oppress the lowest of the people with im punity. For simple incompetence or negli gence they were removed from their offices; but their intentional delinquencies were visited with condign punishment: and the tradition which imputed to Alfred the exe cution of above forty magistrates for their iniquitous or illegal conduct in a single year,f even if unfounded, attests the popular belief The experience of the Northman descents had wofully proved the inadequacy of the ordinary Saxon means of defence. Their fortresses were few in number and con temptible in strength; and the first care of Alfred's policy was to secure all the most assailable and inviting points of debarkation. After instituting a diligent survey of the coasts, he selected the best positions of defence, and in the course of his reign covered the entrance into the principal har bours and navigable rivers of his dominions by no less than fifty strong castles. He also followed up his early plan for the creation of a navy; caused vessels to be constructed of superior magnitude, both in their length and the height of their decks, to those * Asser, ubi supra.

Sax. pp. 92, 98. t These instances are given at length in Home's Mirroir des Justices (pp. 296-300), written in the fourteenth century. * Asser pp. 49, 50. 10"], [112, "[a.d. 878. 74 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. of his stern and impartial justice against his own officers. To guide them in the correct exercise of duties which he thus rigidly exacted, he methodized and amended the laws of his predecessors ; and, with the consent of his witena, as he was careful to declare, published the collection for the national observance. This code does not indeed, as it has sometimes erroneously been assumed, entitle him to any peculiar merit as an original legislator: for its provisions, as well as the earlier laws from which it was chiefly compiled, are still extant, and differ little from each other. But with a true wisdom, adapted to his position and his times, Alfred was more solicitous to retain and renovate institutions which he might know to be defective, than to hazard new experiments which might prove unsuitable to the character and wants of his people.* Even many regulations which have been vulgarly ascribed to his policy, such as the division of England into counties, hundreds, and tythings, the law of frank-pledge, or mutual responsibility of the men of a tything for each other's appearance to answer criminal charges, and the establishment of trial by jury, were all either of earlier or later origin than his age ; f and the veneration which the real benefits of his government deservedly gained for his memory, is in nothing more emphatically marked than in this disposition of posterity to refer every useful institution of police and judicature to his reign. learned recluses, the sole instructors of the times, were either murdered or dispersed in beggary. Hence the very clergy had become as illiterate as the laity; and we have the declaration of Alfred himself, that at the period of his accession to the throne scarcely a person could be found in his own kingdom south of the Thames able to translate a Latin book into his vernacular tongue.* To cor- rect this lamentable state of ignorance, he invited learned men from other parts of England and from foreign countries to his court, and loaded them with savours; he established schools in various parts of his dominions, at which he compelled his un- lettered nobles and officers to place their children, and even to receive instruction themselves, under pain of losing their employments in the state; and he required every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical preferment to gain a knowledge of the Latin language. But it was further his desire that the children of every freeman in his dominions in a condition above penury, should be taught, in their native English, the elements of reading and waiting ; and so anxious was he to extend the scanty stores of Saxon literature for the national benefit, that he himself undertook and accomplished the translation of several Latin works of useful entertainment and piety avowedly for this purpose. An illustrious example, and perhaps the only one to be found in the history of the world, of a prince, amidst the manifold cares of empire, applying his mind to the literary, moral, and religious instruc tion of his people ! f The paternal benevolence and justice of his administration were naturally the quali ties most affectionately appreciated by his people : but the respect in which the scholars of every subsequent age have gratefully united to cherish his fame, is, perhaps, chiefly due to his efforts for the encourage ment of learning. The destruction of the monasteries by the Northmen had almost extinguished in England the few sparks of literature which, during the dark ages, were kept alive only in those retreats ; the libraries which they contained were burnt; and the The long and prosperous interval of tran quillity which Alfred had employed in these benevolent exertions was suddenly termi nated by a renewal of the same calamities of foreign invasion which, in the commence ment of his reign, had brought his kingdom to the verge of destruction. After having, as we have seen, made France the prey of incessant devastation, the Northmen, led by Hastings, the most renowned and dreaded * Leges Sax. pp. 28-46.

Through out this new contest, in which Alfred had the affliction to witness the ravage of his kingdom and the dismal interruption of his plans of social improvement, the utility of his systematic preparations for the public defence was strikingly evinced ; and his activity and conduct in the field were no less admirable than the foresight and wisdom of his previous arrangements. Yet it cost him three years of almost uninterrupted action to repel the furious and indefatigable assaults of the invaders; and the duration and danger of the struggle, supported with such difficulty in the meridian of his power, prove that it must have been undertaken by tne enemy with more formidable resources, and maintained with greater obstinacy and skill, than any of their former enterprises. But the mere details of barbarous and fruit less invasions are little worthy of remem brance ; and we shall dismiss, as briefly as possible, the events of four bloody and destructive campaigns. Northmen with so much celerity that he overtook them at Farnham in Surrey; and there by a complete and sanguinary victory inflicted a signal vengeance for their devas tations. The remains of their host which escaped the slaughter were compelled to capitulate, on condition of quitting the kingdom.* While Alfred was thus engaged he was summoned to repel a new danger from the restless and treacherous spirit of the Danish colonists of East Anglia and Northumbria. Guthrun, who since his conversion to Chris- tianity and his settlement in the former province had religiously maintained his obligations to his conqueror, had now been some years dead; and no longer restrained by his influence, his former subjects eagerly availed themselves of this critical juncture to break off their fealty to Alfred, and began to co-operate with their countrymen. Doubling the Forelands of Kent, a fleet of East Anglian Danes, consisting of one hun- dred sail, proceeded down the channel and attacked the southern coast of Devonshire ; while a smaller squadron, equipped in Northumbria, and circumnavigating Scot- O \u00a9 land, appeared simultaneously on the northern shores of the same county. Hastings also, now temporizing no longer, revealed the full extent of his faithless designs ; for instead of evacuating England altogether, accord- ing to a treaty which he had concluded, he had only withdrawn from his obstructed position in Kent to land on the coast of Essex. Alfred met these redoubled attacks with wonderful promptitude. Leaving his infantry in the east to watch over the motions of Hastings, he traversed Wessex with his horse to Exeter, which the Anglian Danes were already besieging, and fell upon them with such furious slaughter that he drove them in confusion to their ships. In his absence, and while Hastings had quitted his works on the coast to ravage Mercia, the Saxon troops surprised the Danish entrenchments at Bcmfleet in Essex, and captured the shipping, treasures, and family In the first, Hastings, having collected his fleet to the number of above three hundred sail at Boulogne, landed his forces in two divisions on the Kentish shore ; where, according to their usage, they immedi- ately secured themselves by entrenchments. Alfred, as soon as he could assemble the .militia of his kingdom, advanced to the coast, and selected a strong position with so much judgment between the points of descent, that he for some time paralyzed the movements of both the invading armies. With the characteristic perfidy of his race, Hastings endeavoured to extricate himself from his difficulties by offers of peace ; and while on his part he amused Alfred with negotiations, his confederates, secretly break- ing up from their camp, penetrated by forced marches into Wessex before the king could intercept them. But Alfred, being joined by his son Edward and the reserves of the Wessex militia, pursued the route of the * Chron. Sax. pp. 91, 93."], [114, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 898-901. 76 of the sea-king. In an age of cruelty, and in opposition to the counsels of his officers, Alfred had the magnanimity to restore the wife and children of Hastings unharmed and unransomed ; and the Northman, hum bled by these repeated discomfitures, again sued for peace, and obtained it on the former condition of quitting England. It is uncertain whether he fulfilled this treaty better than the last. The hosts of North men whose ravages still continued to afflict the island seem to have been the same which he had commanded ; but it is re markable that the name of Hastings himself is, from this epoch, no longer distinguished as their leader by the \" Saxon Chronicle ; \" and a few years later he reappears in French history on the theatre of his former exploits.* country. They had reached the banks of the Severn before the king could arrest their progress ; nor could he prevent their wintering in a new fortified position at Bridgenorth on that river. But thus con stantly pursued, harassed, and besieged with a perseverance and courage equal to their own, and with resources which the activity of Alfred and the national union of his subjects had now rendered superior, the spirit of the Northmen was at length exhausted and broken. From Bridgenorth they dispersed in small bodies ; those who evaded the Saxon sword effected their return to East Anglia and Northumbria, where some finally settled, and the residue embarking joined the marauding squadrons of their countrymen on the French shores. From thence they still continued at inter vals to infest the Channel and the English coasts with their piracies ; but the navy which Alfred had created frequently chas tised their attempts, and captured so many of their vessels, that they were soon deterred from the prosecution of these barren enter prises* During the subsequent conduct of the war the order and combination which Alfred had introduced into the employment of the national force enabled him everywhere to present a superiority to the invaders ; but all his efforts could not protect different parts of his kingdom from exposure to the inroads of the Northmen, through the rapidity with which their movements were always executed. The remains of the invading bands of Hastings, joined by numerous bodies of their East Anglian and Northumbrian countrymen, bursting out of Essex, twice crossed the island to the banks of the Severn and the Dee ; and though each time besieged and defeated in the west, they effected their return to their eastern quarters. From thence, embarking and entering the Thames, they narrowly failed of success in an attempt to surprise London ; and ascending the river Lee with their fleet, they fortified a position in which they passed the winter. But here Alfred once more besieging them, so completely prevented the egress of their fleet by ingeni ously diverting the course of the waters, that to avoid being starved in their camp they abandoned their useless shipping, and again broke away into the interior of the Alfred survived this second deliverance of his kingdom only about three years ; and the horrors of a pestilence, the consequence perhaps of the devastations of warfare, clouded the last triumphs of his reign. His days closed prematurely, for he expired before the completion of his fifty-second year ; f so short was that life of brilliant and virtuous action by which, in the midst of violence and barbarism, he deservedly won an immortality of renown. That his martial constancy and genius twice rescued his people from the scourge of destructive in vasions might alone have sufficed to enrol him in the catalogue of royal heroes ; but the qualities on which the vulgar greatness of conquest is founded constitute the least part of his merit. The fame of Alfred rests on the sure basis of intellectual, moral, and religious excellence. His generous thirst of universal knowledge, his zeal for the * Chron.

His zeal for the good order and improvement of society sometimes betrayed him into harsh and arbitrary regulations for the promotion of his laudable objects; even his severe love of justice degenerated too often into a stern and cruel persecution of offenders. Yet these were but the excesses of good intentions and principles; and if not defensible in them selves, are scarcely to be weighed in the balance against the immense concomitant benefits of intellectual knowledge and moral discipline to a rude and disorderly age. To believe, as some writers in their just admiration of the character of Alfred have too fondly imagined, that his great qualities were without alloy would be to falsify, not only all experience of human nature, but the positive evidence of his contemporaries and friends. Though the fair promise of his youthful virtues had won the national love even before his accession to the throne, yet it is certain that the first years of his reign were disgraced by some neglects of duty and some immoralities of personal conduct. For his friend and biographer Asser, writing under his eye, confesses of his expulsion from his throne, that this adversity overtook him \" not undeservedly ; \" because in the insolence of youth he had failed to render justice to his subjects, and haughtily turned a deaf ear to their com plaints.* Asser further declares that St. Neot, the kinsman of Alfred, had deplored these errors, and foreboded their punishment ;f and an ancient life of that virtuous recluse expressly repeats, J though still in general terms, the good man's ineffectual remons trance against those vices of conduct in his young sovereign which Asser, while regard to truth compelled him to record, was re strained by delicacy or partiality towards a royal patron from more plainly particularizing. But whatever had been these errors, they were nobly redeemed, and the spirit of Alfred was chastened in that adversity which he himself believed to have been inflicted as the penalty of his sins. \u00a7 In his later life, To estimate minutely the mental accom plishments of this great and good king, is the business rather of literary than political history. But when, on a general view of his qualities, it is considered that his early education had been defective even for his times, and that his acquisition of the Latin language was not gained until he was near forty years of age, the knowledge of letters which he displays in his writings cannot fail to excite our surprise ; and the enlarge ment of mind evinced in his reflections is still more admirable. His desire of informa tion was particularly shown in geographical inquiries ; and the mission on which he sent one of his bishops, Swithelm, with alms to the Christians of Malabar,* from a mixed seeling of pious benevolence and curiosity, has been justly regarded as not only a strong proof of his well-informed and inquisitive spirit, but as the most memorable enterprise of its kind in that age. The existence of no scholar, in a private station or a lettered epoch, was ever marked by more intense in the text of Asser and others, to prove that the success of the Northmen in expelling Alfred from his throne was favoured by the disgust which his misconduct had excited among his own subjects. But this hypothesis is unsupported by tho account given in the Saxon Chronicle, as before cited, by which it appears clearly that both Alfred and his West Saxons were surprised by the winter expedition of Guthrun ; nor is the previous disaffection of his people very reconcilable with the enthusiasm with which they hailed his appearance only four months later. * Asser, p. 31. t Idem, P- 32.

His fall was followed by a pacification between the king and the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes.* devotion to the acquisition of learning, than the busy and distracted life of this sovereign of a semi-barbarous people; and while diligently attending to the occupations of state, Alfred contrived by the methodical division of his time to find leisure for the cultivation of his favourite studies. It wonderfully enhances the merit of these intellectual exertions that they were pursued throughout a public life, not only of mental anxiety and active labour, but of almost incessant corporeal agony: for he was afflicted with a malady which is conjectured, from the description of its symptoms, to have been an internal cancer, and which from his twentieth year to the hour of his death scarcely permitted him any respite from excruciating torture.* Edward, who has been distinguished from later kings of his line and name as the Elder, was a prince of warlike and politic genius, and in the sequel of his reign he accom plished two important steps towards the con solidation of the Saxon monarchy. These were the final incorporation of Mercia into Wessex, and the curbing of the Danish independence in the eastern and northern provinces. The first of these objects he suspended during the life of his sister, Ethelfleda, a woman of masculine spirit and talent, who, as we have seen, jointly with her less energetic husband the ealdorman Ethelred, had long governed Mercia, under a commission from her father Alfred. After the death of her consort, the \"Lady of Mer cia,\" as she was called, essentially aided her brother in his wars with the Danes by her own martial exploits against the common enemy: yet, on her decease (920), the ser vices which she had rendered to him did not prevent Edward from seizing the person and inheritance of her hapless daughter, on the plea of her treasonable intention to marry a Danish prince; and thenceforth Mercia became an integral part of the West Saxon kingdom. With a more justifiable policy, Edward had availed himself of the disunion of the numerous petty states into which the Danish provinces were now divided, to restrain and break their power. He built or seized, in conjunction with Ethelfleda, a strong line of frontier fortresses to protect his own dominions and overawe the posses sions of the enemy; he repeatedly defeated them in conflicts which he probably pro voked ; and before his death he had compelled all their princes to acknowledge him for their lord, and to swear allegiance to his person. t By these achievements Edward prepared The striking vicissitudes which distin guished the reign of Alfred, and the pleasing interest with which his character is invested, have deserved some extended detail, even in the closest abridgment of our national annals: the inferior merits and actions of his descendants may be dismissed with more brevity. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward, to the exclusion of the children of King Ethelred, whose claims to the throne, though well founded according to our modern laws of inheritance, were rejected by the witenagemote. This exclusion was no more than a repetition of that departure from the strict order of succession which had pro cured the election of Alfred himself to the crown, in preference to the same right in the family of his elder brother ; but it now produced a civil war. Ethelwold, the son of Ethelred, after an ineffectual attempt to maintain his pretensions against his cousin in Wessex, fled to the restless Danes of Northumbria and East Anglia, by whom his cause was readily espoused, and his title to the paramount sovereignty of England admitted. At the head of these turbulent partisans, aided by their roving countrymen from the Baltic and France, the exile Ethel wold carried on a harassing contest against his own nation for several years; until his * Chron.

This prince, notwithstanding the probable disgrace of his birth \u2014 for there is reason to conclude that his mother was only the con- cubine of Edward \u2014 was preferred by his father's will to his legitimate brothers; and the choice of the witenagemote confirmed the royal testament. If the title of Athel- stan to the throne was really defective, his personal merit justified his elevation. Even in infancy he had given such indications of superior intelligence as to have been the delight of his grandsire Alfred, who prema- turely invested the child with the highest national insignia of princely and martial honour \u2014 a purple mantle, a jewelled belt, and a short sword \u2014 the seax, or proper weapon of the Saxon \u2014 in a golden scab- bard. As Athelstan grew to man's estate, he enjoyed the good fortune to be placed under the care of his celebrated aunt, Ethel- fleda, by whom he was probably instructed with characteristic ability in public affairs; and as he had reached the age of thirty years before he ascended the throne, he com- menced his reign with the advantage of a matured judgment and experience. These acquirements, founded upon an excellent understanding, enabled him to complete the successful designs of his father for the effectual reduction of all England under one sceptre. His first enterprise was to extin- guish the remains of Danish independence in Northumbria. For this he found an opportunity, in the year after his accession, on the death of Sihtric the Northman sove- reign, to whom he had shortly before given his sister in marriage ; and invading that province, he put the sons of the deceased chieftain to flight, and annexed the whole territory to his immediate dominions. This success stimulated the ambition of Athelstan ; and the dread of his power insured its uni- versal recognition. The prince of Cumbria and the king of the Scots acknowledged themselves his subjects; and the latter, in a subsequent attempt to assert his indepen dence, was reduced to witness the ravage of his territories, and to surrender his son as a hostage for his fidelity. Over the Britons of Cornwall and Wales Athelstan equally extended his dominion. Hitherto the for mer had still continued to maintain some degree of independence of the crown of Wessex. They possessed all the Cornish peninsula from the Land's End to the Exe, and held one-half of Exeter. From that city Athelstan now expelled them ; strongly fortified tbe place to command the surround ing territory; and obliging all its inhabitants of British race to retire beyond the Tamar, reduced them into complete subjection to the government of Wessex. Leading his forces into Wales, he compelled all its princes to do homage, and become tributary to him; and permanently annexing the whole of the border country, as far as the right bank of the Wye, to Mercia, he confined the future limits of Wales within that river.* The apprehension excited by the ambitious encroachments of Athelstan among the Dan- ish, British, and Scottish chieftains, produced the uncommon spectacle of a general union of these rude powers to throw off the Saxon yoke. The operations of the confederacy display a degree of concert very remarkable for that age. Anlaf, the son of the late king of Northumbria, who had retired to Ireland, and conquered a principality for himself on its coast, was instigated by the king of the Scots to attempt the recovery of his paternal inheritance. He collected so enormous a force as to fill above six hundred sail ; and entering the Humber, he had no sooner landed on the Northumbrian shores with a mixed and formidable host, composed of Anglo-Danes, Irish, and levies of Northmen from the Baltic, than he was immediately joined, not only by the army of his Scottish ally, but bands of the Cumbrian and Welsh Britons under their respective princes. Athel- stan prepared to encounter this tremendous invasion with firmness and activity; by pub- lishing offers of high reward to such foreign warriors as would enter his service, he allured several roving sea-kings to his standard ; and * Chron. Sax. p. 111. Malmsbuiy, pp. 46-50."], [118, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 925-940, 80 throughout Europe, is remarkably expressed in several transactions. Such was the respect in which he was held, that three foreign princes were committed in infancy to his care, received their education at his court, and were ultimately placed on their thrones by his aid. These were Haco, king of Nor- way, whose virtues obtained for him the surname of the Good ; Alan of Brittany ; and Louis IV. of France. The Norwegian prince had been sent to Athelstan by his father, Harold Harfagre, renowned among the Scandinavian sovereigns of the age for his power and his suppression of the piracies of the sea-kings. On the death of this mon- arch, the tyranny of his eldest son induced the Norwegians to invite the younger, Haco, to the throne; and Athelstan supplied his pupil with forces to undertake the expedi- tion, which was crowned with success.* The ravage of Brittany by the Northmen under Rollo had occasioned the flight of many of the inhabitants to England ; and among them was one of their princes, with his infant son Alan. Athelstan undertook the education of the boy, and on his attaining the age of manhood sent him back to his country attended by the Breton exiles and a body of Saxon warriors. By the aid of these retainers, and the native population of his race, young Alan by degrees recovered his patrimony, and became the founder of the ducal house of Brittany, j Nor were the foreign relations of the English monarch confined to this restoration of his exiled nephew and ward to his throne: J for the Emperor Henry the Fowler was induced by his fame to seek a family alliance with him, and obtained the sister of Athelstan for the bride of his son Otho.\u00a7 On the death of Athelstan without issue (940), the crown of England devolved upon his brother Edmund. The commencement of this prince's reign was disturbed by a new invasion of Northumbria under Anlaf, who, * Malmsbury, p. 51. Snorre, pp. 121-159. t Chron. Namtenense, in Recueil des Hist.

At length, near some unascertained place in the north of England, named Brun anburgh, the hostile armies closed in a fierce and memorable encounter of nations, the events of which have been equally renowned in Saxon and Scandinavian song. After a battle more obstinate, and a slaughter more terrific, as it is declared, than had ever been known since Briton and Saxon, Saxon and Northman, had striven for the mastery, the victory remained with Athelstan (937). Of the five confederate nations, as they are enumerated, Danes, Norwegians, Britons, Scots, and Irish, immense multitudes fell : the son of the king of Scots, five sea-kings, and many jarls, were numbered with the slain; and Anlaf himself and his Scottish ally only escaped, the former to Ireland and the latter to his own country, with a miserable rem nant of their followers. This great victory secured the domestic dominion of Athelstan, and even extended his fame to foreign lands. The princes of the old British race in Wales and Cumbria, hopeless of further resistance, thenceforth tamely submitted to his sway; those of Northman blood throughout the Danelagh had either perished, or were com pelled to sink into the same dependent rank with his own nobles ; and blending the whole of the Saxon and Danish provinces, of which the Octarchy had originally been composed, into one kingdom, Athelstan became, in reality as in title, the first monarch of all England* The remainder of his reign was undis turbed and glorious ; and the high reputation which his personal virtues,*)* even more than his successes and power, had obtained for him, not only in his own kingdom but * Chron. Sax. pp. 111-111. Ingulf, pp. 29-37. Malms bury, pp. 48-52. Egilli Saga (Juhnstone, Celto-Scandic\u00e6), p 31. t The amiable qualities as well as the talents of Athelstan are celebrated by all the chroniclers of his reign. The story which attributes to him the death of his eldest legitimate brother, Edwin, who perished at sea, has not seemed to deserve a place in the text, for it is at variance with every recorded trait of his benevolent character; Malmsbury, in repeating it from a ballad, seems to doubt its truth (p. 48, &c), and the Saxon Chronicle merely states (p. 1 1 1) the fact of the prince's being lost at sea."], [119, "a.d. 946-955.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND, 81 since his disastrous defeat at Brunanburgh, had been intimidated from any renewal of hostilities against Athelstan, but was now encouraged by the decease of that powerful monarch to attempt the recovery of his Northumbrian patrimony. Landing from the Humber with a large army, he not only established himself in the north of England, but reduced Edmund, after a series of hostili ties, to conclude a treaty by which the pos session of the kingdom was divided between them. The particulars of this enterprise of Anlaf are even more obscurely than briefly related in the chronicles of the age : but its success offers so strange a contradiction to the strength which was recently apparent in the Saxon monarchy, that it can only be explained by the suspicion of some national disunion, or disaffection to the youthful government of Edmund. But whatever were the causes which had produced an accommo dation so disgraceful to the English king, the death of his rival soon relieved him from its ignominy ; and Edmund immediately seized the fortunate occasion to re-establish his dominion over the northern provinces. The complete restoration of his authority is proved by his subsequent conquest of the British principality of Cumbria or Strath clyde, which, after deposing its sovereign, he bestowed upon Malcolm, king of Scots, subject to the condition that he should hold it under the crown of England, and render aid in opposing all future invasions of the Northmen. The short reign of Edmund was closed by a tragical event, of which the details are involved in much uncertainty. He was murdered during a banquet, prob ably in some drunken brawl ; but according to the tale usually received, by a notorious robber named Leof, who having some years before been banished for his crimes, auda- versions of the story differing essentially in their details. But in all, tbe single indis putable circumstance most worthy of obser vation is that which betrays the barbarous state of manners \u2014 the casual murder of the king in an hour of festivity (946).* Although Edmund left two infant sons, the crown was bestowed by a Saxon witen agemote, at which some of the Welsh princes appear to have assisted, upon his brother Edred. The only event worthy of record in the brief reign of this prince was the final reduction of the Northumbrian Danes into immediate dependence on the English crown, and the complete annexation of their state to the Saxon kingdom. Availing himself of the provocation afforded by their repeated revolts, and the weakness engendered by the rivalry of their contending chiefs, Edred led a large army into their country, punished their rebellion by the cruel devastation of many of its finest districts, and carried off1 all the principal nobles as captives or hostages. To consolidate his authority, he parcelled the whole of the north of England into counties, with subdivisions similar to those of the Saxon provinces ; committed the adminis tration of each district to an officer of his own appointment; and for ever abolishing the refal title which the Danish chieftains O had arrogated, placed the whole of North umbria under the superintendence of a single nobleman with the title of earl. These measures were effectual ; and with the settle ment imposed by Edred terminated the long strurro-le of the Northmen for independence in those seats which they had originally won from the Anglo-Saxons.f After wearing the crown no more than nine years, Edred, whose whole life had been a prey to disease, died without leaving any children (955), and was succeeded by Edwin, or Edwy, the eldest of his two nephews, who appears to have been, at the epoch of his accession, scarcely eighteen years of age. Inglorious in its political relations, and ciously forced himself into the royal presence. Enraged at the intrusion, the king is said to have started from his seat and seized him by the hair, when the outlaw plunged a dagger into his breast. The king expired on the spot ; and the murderer was immediately put to death by his attendants. There are other \u2022 Chron. Sax. pp. 114, 115. Ingulf, pp. 29, 30. Malms bury, p. 53. f Chron. Sax. p. 115. Ingulf, pp. 30-41. 11"], [120, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 955-958. 82 ear; a suspicion, the honourable evidence of his superiority, that he was indebted for his accomplishments to magical practices, or some other charge less absurd, was employed to alienate the growing favour of Athelstan; and the young aspirant being driven from the court, withdrew to the protection of his uncle. At this epoch he formed an attach ment to a young maiden of his own rank, and would have wedded her; but the arch bishop opposed the union, and earnestly exhorted him to embrace the monastic pro fession. His refusal was followed by a second violent illness, caused probably by mental anxiety and the twofold disappointment of youthful ambition and love; the suggestions of his ecclesiastical friends taught him to consider the sufferings and hallucinations of disease as special signs of the Divine will, and when he arose from a sick-bed he was an altered man. Renouncing the world, he returned to the place of his education, took the monastic vows, and for some years served the church of Glastonbury. But his ardent spirit, wounded by blighted passions and darkened by fanaticism, was incapable of the calmness of true devotion. Not contented with observing the usual obligations of clois tered discipline, he imposed on himself the most extravagant severities, and in a life of seclusion and penance fed the malady of an afflicted heart and a disturbed imagination. It need not be doubted that these austerities increased the mental disorder to which he had already been subject. He fancied him self assailed by the powers of darkness ; he related both his combats with the Evil One, and the celestial visions which comforted his victorious faith ; and the particulars of these spiritual encounters were probably at first detailed by himself, and received by his superstitious auditory, with equal sincerity.* unfortunate in its domestic occurrences, the reign of Edwin might claim little notice, if its principal incident had not alternately afforded a subject for popular romance and controversial zeal. In our own times, at the distance of nine centuries, the insignificant quarrel of a Saxon prince and a Romish saint has been revived in a spirit which betrays at least as much polemical virulence as anxiety for historical truth ; and modern research into so unimportant a part of our annals has been busily occupied with the character and actions of the canonized monk. This was the famous Dunstan,* first abbot of Glaston bury, and afterwards archbishop of Canter bury, whose genius constituted him the most remarkable man of his country and age, and whose ambitious ascendancy in civil and ecclesiastical affairs renders him the most prominent actor in the reigns of Edwin and his successor. The birth' of Dunstan was noble ; and the care of his education having been intrusted to the clergy of Glastonbury, the most celebrated seat of learning in the kingdom, he was early initi ated into all the sciences and accomplish ments, such as they were, of which the times could boast. His youth was already distin guished by these acquirements, when his intense application to study produced a vio lent illness, which seems to have had a remarkable effect upon his subsequent char acter and conduct in life. His disorder terminated in delirium; and it is recorded that during its paroxysm he leapt from his couch, wandered to the roof of the church of Glastonbury, and fell unhurt into the aisle. After this providential escape, which was magnified into a miracle, he was introduced by his uncle, Athelm, archbishop of Can terbury, at the court of Athelstan, where his general talents, and especially his proficiency in music, at first excited the interest and amused the leisure of the king. But the envious whispers of rivals poisoned the royal Osborne, Vita Dunstani (pp. 88, 97). It is this writer who relates the well-known tale of St. Dunstan's conflict with the devil. While the saint was busily engaged during the night in his favourite exercise of working metals, the tempter thrust his head in at the window of the lonely cell ; and his sturdy antagonist immediately seized him by the nose with a pair of red-hot pincers, which it chanced that he was using. The devil roared lustily with the pain ; and the fact was indisput able, for his bellowings were heard by all the neighbourhood in the midnight stillness. \u2022 Among the extant lives of Dunstan most usually con sulted, are those by Osborne (published in Wharton's Anglia Sacra, vol. ii.), by Eadmer (of which extracts are printed in the same volume), and a MS. in the British Museum (Cleo patra, B 13), quoted by Mr. Turner"], [121, "a.d. 955-958.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 83 Up to this epoch the conduct of Dunstan is readily explicable without any presump tion of intentional fraud. It is evident from the repeated effects of illness that he had that unhappy constitutional predisposition to enthusiasm which is not unfrequently found in conjunction with the most acute intellectual powers, and perfectly compatible with their vigorous exercise. It was the misfortune of his early years to be thwarted in the pursuit of honourable distinction and the indulgence of virtuous affection ; and under the temporary pressure of the agoniz ing struggles and consequent derangement of his mind, he became a victim to a mistaken sense of duty and a prey to the fatal illusions of solitude. His imaginative genius misled his feelings, and his ardent piety degenerated into fanaticism. But in the history of the human mind, from fanaticism, when allied to great and ambitious talents, there has ever been found a sure stage of progression to recovered judgment and final imposture. At what period in the life of Dunstan this change was wrought, it is not difficult to conjecture. The fame of his trials and his sanctity quickly spread from the vicinity of his cell to the remotest parts of the king dom; and Edmund, the successor of Athel stan, invited the holy recluse to that court from which the young and accomplished thane had been ignominiously driven. Dunstan eagerly obeyed the call ; for his ambition had slumbered, not died: its objects were partially changed, not its impulses extinguished ; and emerging from his narrow cell, the monk, now aspiring to establish his own power on the aggrandizement of his order, by degrees acquired the greatest influ ence over the ecclesiastical and civil adminis tration of the kingdom. By Edmund he was made abbot of Glastonbury, and treated with much veneration; and Edred not only took him for the spiritual director of his conscience, but surrendered to him the charge of all his earthly treasures, and the virtual government of the state.* temporary fall on the death of his royal patron. Edwin, who had been taught to consider himself wrongfully excluded from the possession of his crown by the usurpation of his uncle, no sooner ascended the throne than he rashly began to betray his distrust and hatred towards all the favourites of the late reign, and especially towards Dunstan. The ministers of Edred were expelled from their offices; and the clergy, who had re ceived many rich endowments through the influence of the abbot of Glastonbury, were violently dispossessed. It is not safe to receive implicitly the odious portrait which the monkish chroniclers, with no unnatural zeal for their outraged order, have drawn of the vices of Edwin ; but amidst their probable exaggerations it may be discerned that in the young king, with a beauty of person which obtained for him the surname of the Fair, were united many mental deformities : he was vain and debauched, passionate and tyrannical. These qualities might excite the indignation of the austere abbot of Glastonbury; it is certain that they were shortly rendered a pretext for the most audacious attack of a subject upon the per sonal dignity of a sovereign of which history has any example. On the day of his coro nation Edwin retired early from the banquet, while his nobles were yet indulging that habit of deep carousal to which the Saxon, like all the Teutonic races, were too much addicted. The absence of the king dis pleased the company, and Dunstan and a bishop undertook to bring him back to the hall. They are reported to have found him in an inner chamber of the palace, seated with two ladies, mother and daughter, to one of whom, Ethelgiva, or Elgiva, he was tenderly attached. The exact nature of their union has been a disputed point: by the monkish writers she is called his mis tress; but being also his kinswoman, and, as some authorities make her, his wife, it is altogether most probable that the reproach of concubinage was directed only against a marriage within the degrees of affinity pro hibited by the canon law. But however From this elevation Dunstan sustained a \u2022 Osborne, pp. 97, 103."], [122, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 955-958. 84 the many real reforms of the Benedictine discipline, there is no reason to doubt that he acted in sincere consistency with those stern principles of abstinence which he imposed in his own case upon every passion but ambition. But his efforts to enforce and extend the monastic vow of celibacy drew him and his followers into collision with the secular clergy, who appeared to have been generally married ; and they naturally regarded the banishment of Dun stan and his monks as the triumph of their party in the church. this may have been, Dunstan and his asso ciate, bursting upon the privacy of the king, and loading both ladies with every coarse invective, dragged their sovereign by force from their society into the revelling assembly of his nobles. Thus ignominiously insulted and exposed to contempt before all the peers of his realm, we need not wonder that the royal youth impetuously revenged the indig nity which had been offered to him as a man and a king. He sent an armed force to Glastonbury to seize on the property of Dunstan and expel him from his monastery; banished him from England ; and inflicted the same proscription on the monks throughout the kingdom, of whom the great abbot had been the principal protector.* By this act, indeed, the king had pro claimed himself the patron of the secular clergy: but he soon found that their influ ence was inferior to that of their rivals. The sanctity of Dunstan, and the reforma tions of discipline which he had introduced, had rendered him and the monks equally popular with the nation ; and they were scarcely banished before a general insur rection, instigated, or at least headed, by the archbishop Odo, broke out in various parts of England. A sentence of divorce or separation, to which the young king was compelled to yield, was passed by Odo against Elgiva; and after being torn from her royal husband or lover, and cruelly branded in the face with hot iron, she was banished, or, as it is said, sold for a slave, into Ireland. The horrible sequel of her fate has given a still more touching interest to her romantic story: having contrived to rejoin the king, she was seized, barbarously hamstrung by the command of Odo, and expired under this miserable torture. The calamities which terminated the life and reign of Edwin himself are only obscurely intimated. The insurgents having set up his younger brother Edgar against him with the royal title, he was first reduced, after a short and ineffectual struggle, to consent to a partition of the kino-dom and soon after perished prematurely and wretchedly, the victim either of assassina tion or grief.* In the prosecution of these violent mea sures there was involved a far wider subject of hostility than the personal quarrel of Dunstan and the king. This was no less than the rivalry of the secular and monastic clergy. The history of the establishment and growth of the famous rule of St. Benedict belongs to the ecclesiastical divi sion of these pages ; but it is here necessary to observe that Dunstan, in concert with Odo, archbishop of Canterbury, had ardently advocated that system of monastic govern ment, and enjoined its observance on the religious houses in England. In introducing * Osborne, pp. 104, 105. Malmsbury, p. 55, &c. It would be foreign to the purpose of this work to enter minutely into the merits of the modern controversy on the circumstances of Edwin's reign, which have been related in the text. In his zeal for the honour of a Romish saint, Dr. Lingard has laboured to expose the vices of Edwin, and the criminality of his union with Elgiva ; and it may be conceded to his arguments that our historians, with an opposite bias, had too positively assumed the innocence of a dubious connection. But the settlement of a question, at once so obscure in itself, and so utterly inconse quential in a historical point of view, will scarcely be received by any decent reader as an excuse for introducing those gross obscenities from the monkish chronicles with which he has defiled his pages ; nor, whatever might be the demerits of the lady, could they justify the insolent intrusion of the monk upon the privacy of his sovereign, or the revolting cruelties which his party subsequently inflicted upon the unhappy Elgiva. The favourable portrait of Dunstan which he found in the monkish writers it was natural that the Roman Catholic historian should copy ; the miracles of the saint, which are attested on precisely the same authority with his virtues, it was discreet to reject: bit that the outrage of Dunstan upon the royal person should seem an occasion for applause is strange; and it is not easy to refuse assent to the conclusion of Mr. Turner, that \"as an ecclesiastic he should not have compelled Edwin to a scene of inebriety; as a subject it was treasonable to offer violence to his prince.\" * Ingulf, p. 41. Malmsbury, p. 55. Vid<- also a note (No. 6<) by Mr. Turner, Hist, of Anglo-Saxons, vol. ii. p. 409."], [123, "a.d. 958-959.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 85 On the death of Edwin the possession of the whole kingdom devolved upon Edo-ar, whose fortunate reign of sixteen years offers a singular interval of undisturbed peace In the troubled series of the Anglo-Saxon annals. For this career of prosperity it is probable that the young monarch was origin ally in a great measure indebted to the talents of Dunstan. Immediately after the success of the rebellion against Edwin the abbot of Glastonbury had been recalled from exile by his party, and Edgar resigned him self entirely to the counsels of his brother's enemy. Dunstan was shortly promoted, first to the see of Worcester, next to that of London, and finally to the archbishopric of Canterbury. The circumstances of his elevation to this last dignity are illustrative both of the boundless influence which he had acquired, and of the unscrupulous spirit in which he had learnt to indulge his ambi tion. At an earlier stage in his career, whether with sincere or affected humility, he had refused a bishopric : he now not only held a plurality of sees, but caused the pri mate Brithelm, a man of acknowledged piety and meekness, to be displaced to make room for himself. The pretext was Brithelm's want of energy in the enforcement of eccle siastical discipline, and the authority of the witenagemote was obtained for his removal ; but it can scarcely be doubted that the instigator of his deprivation was the powerful minister who reaped the advantage of his fall. Thus invested with the highest func tions both of civil and ecclesiastical govern ment, Dunstan proceeded vigorously in the exaltation of his order; and he certainly appears, while he augmented their wealth and power, to have reformed the disorders of the Anglo-Saxon church, which had suffered equally in its temporalities and discipline amidst the long calamities of the Danish invasions. The plans of Dunstan were zealously supported by the authority and munificence of Edgar ; and in the numerous monasteries for which the arch bishop obtained considerable endowments from the king, the provisions of the Bene- dictine rule were introduced in all their strictness.* These measures were not effected without some persecuting violence against the secu lar clergy : but the efforts of Dunstan were seconded by the ability of two dependents, Oswald and Athelwold, whom he raised to the episcopal dignity, and also associated with himself in the civil government of the state. His own sagacity was proved in the selection of these men, who served his views with equal talent and fidelity; and to the wisdom and activity of their joint adminis tration may with great probability be ascribed the uninterrupted prosperity of Edgar's reign. Under a guidance, indeed, to which he ap pears to have implicitly submitted, that young monarch acquired and enjoyed a degree of security and power unknown to the greatest of his predecessors. Not only was the tranquillity of his kingdom undis turbed, but his sovereignty was acknow ledged by all the minor princes of the island. For the protection of the coasts of the kingdom, large fleets were maintained in different stations, from which the kino-, annually embarking in succession, cruised round the island, and by this display of maritime strength and preparation deterred the Northman pirates from any attempt to renew their invasions.! By affecting a partiality for his own Danish subjects in East Anglia and Northumbria, he secured their attachment to his government and person, while he not the less effectually curbed their independence; and he especi ally gratified their national pride by per mitting them to choose their own laws.t. Other examples of the \"legislation of this reign, which have been preserved in the Saxon codes, are favourable to the memory of Edgar and his ministers : such as the restoration of the debased coinage to a purer standard, and some provisions for the equal * Osbome, Vita Dunstani, pp. 108-111.

Although she placed herself, for the attainment of her ends, at the head of a party in opposition to Dunstan, she could neither overthrow the power of that prelate in the state, nor prevent him from securing the suffrages of a witenagemote in favour of the rightful claim of her step-son to the crown. The accession of young Edward confirmed the authority of Dunstan; but the arts of Elfrida had revived the contest between the secular and monastic clergy for the temporalities of the church, and the peace of the kingdom was disturbed by a struggle between the two factions which maintained those conflicting interests. But the good fortune or dexterity of Dunstan finally triumphed; and his opponents were confounded by two events which the super stition of the age attributed to the miracu lous interposition of heaven. During a stormy synod held in the cathedral at Winchester, a crucifix in the wall is said, by the biographers of the saint, to have received the gift of speech, and to have pronounced the Divine will in favour of the monastic order. If this veracious oracle did not silence the pretensions of the secular clergy, their supporters were shortly warned to renounce their cause by a more tragical occurrence. In a witenagemote summoned at Calne in Wiltshire, wThere the claims of the rival orders were violently debated, Dunstan had just declared that he committed the protection of the church to Christ, when the floor of the council-chamber suddenly gave way at the end on which the opponents of the monastic order were collected; and being precipitated to the earth below, they were all either killed or dangerously hurt \u2014 while the archbishop and his friends remained on their side of the apartment unmoved and uninjured. Modern writers have not hesitated to ascribe this catastrophe to the deliberate preparation of Dunstan: but the obvious difficulties of such a con- Notwithstanding the recorded merits of his government, however, and although the monkish chroniclers have laboured to eulo gize their patron as assiduously as they have exaggerated the vices of his brother, there are not wanting proofs that the successful life of Edgar was more licentious than the unfortunate career of Edwin. It is acknow ledged that he carried off a lady from a nunnery by force, and made her the victim of his brutal violence; for which Dunstan indeed subjected him to a long and appa rently severe penance, since it required him to fast twice a week for seven years, and to abstain from wearing his crown : but its chief obligation was artfully converted into an expedient for increasing the power and wealth of the monastic order by new religious foundations.}. Other tales, also, resting on inferior evidence but still attesting the popular opinion of his immorality, have been preserved: but their details are unfit for these pages. \u00a7 The well-known story of his second marriage with the beautiful Elfrida should perhaps be received with some suspicion, because its circumstances are unnoticed by the writers who lived nearest to the event, by whom it is merely said that the king married Elfrida after the death of her husband: but the union, whether guilt less or otherwise, proved equally calamitous in its fruits. Edgar died at an early age, leaving two sons, Edward by a former queen, and Ethelred by the second marriage, the first still a minor, and the other a child ; and the ambition of Elfrida was immediately excited to obtain the succession to the throne * Chron. Sax. ubi supra. Leges, pp. 77, 80. t Malmsbury, p. 59. X Osborne, Vita Dunstani, p. 111. Malmsbury, p. 60. \u00a7 Malmsbury, ubi supra. * Chron. Sax. p. 122. Ingulf, p. 54. Osborne, p. 112."], [125, "a.d. 979.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 87 trivance may be received as a sufficient reason for at least refusing to affix the reproach of so diabolical a plot with posi tiveness on his memory.* It is more probable that he dexterously improved an accident as beneficial to his own party as it was calamitous for his opponents; and this supposition, which still leaves him charge able with the secondary guilt of counter feiting a miracle to impose upon the credulity of a superstitious people, is in perfect ao-ree ment with other events of his life. his minority Elfrida, although covered with the public execration, succeeded in usurping a large share of the administration of govern ment. As Ethelred, however, advanced towards manhood, her influence visibly declined, and probably that of Dunstan again acquired the ascendant. For, a few years after the murder of Edward, we find the archbishop ostentatiously taking up his remains to inter them with regal honours at Shaftesbury; while Elfrida, withdrawing from the court of her son, sought a shelter from the abhorrence of the nation in monastic seclusion, and there, in mortified pride or penitence, terminated her flagitious exist ence. The close of Dunstan's ambitious and busy career offers a contrast of undi minished prosperity. That the last years of his life are little recorded, is the surest proof that they were undisturbed; and he ended his long and fortunate life just in time to escape the worst calamities of foreign war and domestic disunion, with which his devoted country was on the eve of being overwhelmed.* Foiled in her intrigues by the superior artifice of Dunstan, Elfrida had now recourse to assassination ; and before he had completed the fourth year of his reign, her step-son became the victim of her wicked ambition. It chanced, as the young king was hunting in the vicinity of Corse castle in Dorsetshire, her residence, that he unsuspiciously and unattended stopped at her gate to see her and his brother. She went out to receive him with a smiling countenance; but he declined to alight, and having requested a cup of mead, was in the act of raising the goblet to his lips when he was treacherously stabbed in the back by one of her retainers. Feeling himself wounded, he had just strength to give the spur to his steed before he fell from his saddle, and was dragged by the stirrup until his attendants, tracking his course in his blood, overtook his lifeless body, and privately buried it (979).f The authoress of this foul tragedy was not only suffered to escape the punishment of her atrocious guilt, but in a great measure reaped its expected fruits. As her son Ethelred was now become, by the murder of his brother, the last scion of the house of Cerdic, Dunstan could not prevent his elevation to the vacant throne; and during We now enter upon the most disgraceful and calamitous epoch in the Anglo-Saxon annals. The personal character of Ethelred perhaps produced, and certainly aggravated, the miseries of his reign. It is said that his spirit had been broken in childhood by the tyranny of his mother; and the national chroniclers have preserved an anecdote as creditable to his youthful feelings as it is expressive of her barbarous temper. When the boy king wept at the murder of a beloved brother, which had produced his untimely and inauspicious accession to the throne, Elfrida chastised his reproachful tears with so much severity that his life was endangered. The pusillanimity which marked his conduct in after life has, appa rently not without reason, been ascribed to the influence exercised over his dawning character by the perpetual terror through which so unnatural a mother may have endeavoured to bend his temper into abject \u2022 Osborne, pp. 112-114.

Dr. Lingard has made a bold effort to discard the tales of the miracles attributed to Dunstan, at Winchester and Calne, by the two writers first quoted above. Yet these are the very authorities on which, in other respects, he rests his defence of the conduct of the Baint ; and, in fact, as almost all we know of Dunstan is gathered from his monkish eulogists, it is precisely from their panegyrics that the most suspicious circumstances of his conduct have been exposed, and that the most unfavourable conclusions against him are deducible.

Landing near Southampton, he plundered that place, and encouraged by impunity, repeated his assaults in the same and the following season on the coasts of Thanet, Devon, and Cornwall. The success of these and other marauding assaults by which they were immediately followed, although con ducted on a small scale and for no other object than desultory pillage, were of fatal importance in revealing the careless imbe cility of Ethelred's government, and the defenceless condition to which it exposed his kingdom. In a few years after the first descent of the pirates, the effects of this discovery were fully developed. A far more numerous fleet appeared on the East Anglian coast; and a formidable body of Northmen, disembarking from their ships, surprised Ipswich, penetrated through the country to Maiden, and there, after an obstinate conflict, defeated and slew the ealdorman, Brithnoth. The king, startled from his indolent repose, was terrified at this first approach of real danger, and instead of opposing the invaders in the field, he had the pusillanimity, on the counsel of Arch bishop Siric, the successor of Dunstan, to purchase their retreat by a payment of ten thousand pounds of silver (991).* submission to her will.* He indeed was delivered from her yoke before he attained the maturity of his age : but he early dis played an insensibility of spirit to aught save pleasure, which presented an ignoble contrast with the commanding dignity and gracefulness of person for which he was distinguished; and the appropriate surname of \"The Unready\" which his subjects, in the quaint language of the times, learned to bestow upon him, marks their apprecia tion of the prevailing indolence of his character. Although himself innocent of \u00a9 the murder of his brother, the circumstances of his accession had been originally associated in the minds of the people with his mother's guilt ; their affection was withheld from his youth; and in his later years their indiffer ence was changed into contempt and hatred by his slothful neglect of public duties, the voluptuous indulgence of his private life, and his utter disregard for the opinions and feelings, the wants and sufferings, of the nation. f England had now for almost a century enjoyed an exemption from the ancient ravages of the Northmen; and it cannot be doubted that this long interval of security had produced its natural fruits of increasing prosperity and civilization. While the watchfulness with which, during this period, the coasts of the island were guarded, had deterred or discouraged the northern pirates from continuing their assaults, the state of Scandinavia itself had become less favour able for such enterprises. There had appeared more than one race of princes whose increasing and permanent dominion over the shores of the Baltic rendered it their interest to suppress piracy; the cruel profession of the sea-kings was gradually proscribed; and the benign influence of Christianity, the parent and harbinger of every social good, began slowly to penetrate into the original seats of the most ferocious idolatry. The spirit of piratical adventure, however, though in its last stage, was not This disgraceful expedient was not indeed the first example of its kind ; but it had never before been used under circumstances so little justifiable, since the kingdom was not, as in the time of Alfred, exhausted by a long and devastating contest. The con tribution now levied to supply the demand of the invaders was long remembered by the nation as the precedent for that odious impost, under the title of Danegelt, which was continued for ages after all pretext for its appropriation had ceased ; and the very * Turner, Hist, of Anglo-Saxons, vol. ii. p. 468. t Ingulf, pp. 55, 56.

The con- dition of the devoted kingdom soon became really desperate ; and as often as the witen- agemote were roused to more manly coun- sels, the public preparations were rendered abortive by the sloth or timidity of the king, the vices of his government, the treason of the nobles, and the general disaffection of the people. Among the worst traitors to the national cause at this shameful and miserable period, the name of Elfric, ealdor- man of Mercia, has obtained an infamous distinction. In some vicissitudes of faction, which are only obscurely intimated, this man had been first driven into banishment, but was afterwards reinstated in his government, and was now imprudently intrusted with a principal command against the enemy. In this situation, under some impulse of revenge or in the mere wantonness of treachery, he seized the critical moment at which a Danish naval armament might have been surprised in port, to give them timely intelligence of their danger and to join their standard with his retainers. He shared their flight, and escaped the pursuit of the Anglo-Saxon fleet : but his son being captured, Ethelred took a barbarous and dastardly vengeance for the crimes of the father by causing the youth to be deprived of his eyes. The Northmen shortly transferring the scene of invasion from the southern shores of the kingdom to the banks of the Humber, the three principal chieftains who were charged with the defence of the district imitated the example of Elfric, and went over to the enemy, f Denmark and Norway, entered the Thames, the war assumed the aspect, as of old, of a national contest between the Saxon and Northman races. An attack made by the two Scandinavian kings upon London was repelled ; but they ravaged the surrounding counties with impunity, and Ethelred a second time had recourse to money instead of arms. For sixteen thousand pounds of silver he purchased a peace from the invaders upon the further condition of providing them winter quarters at Southampton. By the desertion of Olave, who had already embraced Christianity, and now, on receiv- ing the rite of confirmation from two of the English bishops, swore never again to draw his sword against their nation, Sweyn was compelled also to retire with his diminished forces: but for the next seven years the coasts of the island were not the less a prey to perpetual ravages ; and at length, when a new Danish host had landed in Hampshire, and extended its devastations throughout \u00a9 the west of England, its retreat was again purchased by a third and still more enor mous tribute of twenty-four thousand pounds of silver (1001).* It is a trite observation that the cowardly are ever cruel; and if any act were now wanting to complete the degradation of the English nation, it was supplied by the next measure to which the feeble Ethelred was stimulated by his perfidious and pusillani mous counsellors. The last ignominious pacification was followed by the most atro cious transaction in the Anglo-Saxon annals. This was the memorable massacre of the Danish residents in England. The precise nature of the instigation to this revolting \u00a9 D deed, the extent of the slaughter, and the description and number of its victims, are points involved in much uncertainty: the perpetration of the crime is historically in disputable, and its enormity can neither be mitigated nor increased by any computation of the slain.

In the bitterness of death she is said to have foreboded the stern vengeance which her brother would one day exact from the whole En-dish nation; and the event soon abun- dantly realized her prediction.* In the summer after the massacre of St. Brice's Day, the Danish monarch and his host, burning to revenge the fate of their countrymen, landed near Exeter, and com- menced a career of retributive and frightful devastation, which continued with little ces- sation for above four years. The invaders successively penetrated into every part of the kingdom ; each city which they captured was reduced to ashes; each district which they overran was uniformly desolated with fire and sword ; and all the wretched inhab- itants who fell into their hands suffered death in dreadful varieties of torture. As often as despair nerved the people to resist- ance, treason and imbecility marred the efforts of their native courage ; and one instance of infatuation, in the employment of the convicted traitor Elfric, who had re- covered the favour of Ethelred only to repeat his treason, may sufficiently exemplify the whole conduct of the war. It was at length terminated, when the vengeance of Sweyn was satiated in blood and conflagration, by his acceptance of thirty-six thousand pounds of silver as the price of peace : an immense sum to be levied on the kingdom in that age, and after the previous exactions and desola tion. To complete the wretchedness of the people, the ravages of the merciless invaders produced several seasons of grievous famine; a contagious distemper raged among the cattle; and to sum up the catalogue of hor rors, this murrain was followed by a pesti lence equally destructive to human lifcf criminately among the natives in every city, burgh, and county; and it has been plausibly conjectured that these foreigners were mer cenaries in the pay of Ethelred, who were quartered upon the inhabitants, and whose fidelity had become as suspicious as their insolence was insupportable. It has also been justly argued that the proscription could not have embraced all families of Northman descent in the island, since they filled the north-eastern provinces, and com posed a third part of the whole population.* But it is equally incontrovertible that, not merely the foreign stipendiaries, but many distinguished personages of Northman blood who were allied by the dearest ties with Saxon families, were included in the bloody catastrophe. On St. Brice's Eve (1002) every city throughout the kingdom received secret instructions from Ethelred for a simul taneous massacre of the foreigners on the morrow of the festival. These orders were executed by a ferocious populace with every aggravation of brutality and horror which national hate could inspire or devise; men, women, and even infants at the breast, were remorselessly butchered ; neither the bonds of intermarriage nor friendship between indi viduals of the two races were respected ; nor did even a community of religion obtain mercy for those Christian Danes who, having taken refuge in the churches, were slain around the altars to which they clung. Among these victims was a princess, whose rank and character have preserved a parti cular record of her sufferings, and drew down a signal vengeance upon the whole kingdom. Gunhilda, the sister of Sweyn, a woman of remarkable beauty and talents, had embraced Christianity, and wedded a chieftain of Danish race, who had settled in England and been intrusted with a high command. He is accused of having acted treacherously in the last invasion of his countrymen ; and Gunhilda, after being made the eye-witness of his murder and that of her innocent children, by order of Edric, the infamous These afflictions produced little respite from the calamities of warfare.

A vigorous national exertion was now made to repel the enemy; but a great armament thus collected was, as usual, rendered useless and disorganized by the deadly feuds of the nobles and the mis- conduct of Edric, whom we have before mentioned, a man of low birth and infamous character, but of eminent ability, whom the favour of Ethelred had elevated to the high- est authority in the state. He was now created Ealdorman of Mercia; and the same perfidious ambition and traitorous machina- tions by which had been caused many of the past, were now employed to deepen the subsequent, calamities of his country. But the patience of the reader would only be wearied, and his attention disgusted, by an attempt to pursue the details of the incessant ravages and treasons of which the history of this disgraceful reign is compounded. A third invasion of Sweyn, with an army more numerous and better appointed than in either of his preceding expeditions, was followed by the conquest of great part of the king- dom; and so completely was the spirit of the nation now broken, that, according to the confession of the \" Saxon Chronicle,\" one Dane was accounted equal in battle to ten Englishmen. Ethelred fled in despair to the court of Richard duke of Normandy, whose sister, Emma, he had married; and the victorious Sweyn became the first North man king of England. * \u00a9 o nobles obtaining an oath from the fugitive 1 \u2022 l _ - king that he would govern more justly than heretofore, his return upon this condition was welcomed with acclamations. Sweyn, by his last testament, had appointed his son Canute to succeed him : but that prince was at first unable to maintain his power, and compelled to desert his adherents and retire to Denmark. He soon, however, reappeared in greater force, and acquired new strength by the continued misconduct and tyranny of Ethelred. The death of that monarch at this juncture relieved the kingdom from the burden of his useless and mischievous exist- ence ; and the sinking cause of the house of Cerdic was, for a few months, nobly though ineffectually sustained by the gallantry of his eldest son and successor, Edmund, whose martial prowess obtained for him the sur- name of \" Ironside,\" and the memory of whose deeds, exaggerated by popular ro- mance, was long cherished in affectionate admiration by the English. After an obsti- nate and indecisive struggle, throughout which the efforts of Edmund were rendered abortive by the perfidy of Edric, the Saxon prince was compelled to conclude a paci- fication with the Northman, whereby they divided England between them. To Canute, whose partisans probably were most numer- ous in the old Danish provinces, Edmund resigned all the kingdom northward of the Thames : but he survived this afflicting \u00a9 treaty no more than a month; and on his premature death, of which the mode and the cause are left by contemporary writers in suspicious obscurity, his rival was elected king of all England by the universal con sent or fears of the nation. * From this epoch, therefore, may be dated <he establishment of their dynasty in our island. This strange and sudden revolution o was not wholly the effect of conquest: for there are many proofs that the misgovern ment of Ethelred had produced a general disaffection and alienation among his people, and that, finding themselves left by their own unworthy monarch a prey to the in vaders, they at length sought safety and repose by a voluntary transference of their allegiance to a foreign sceptre. But the unexpected death of Sweyn, only a few weeks after the flight of Ethelred, revived the hope of national independence; and the Saxon The character of Canute, not undeserv edly surnamed the Great, was compounded of barbarian violence and grandeur; and the events of his reign exhibit him to us at different epochs as the ferocious tyrant and the beneficent protector of his subjects.

During the first years after his undisputed enjo} onent of the throne of England, as well as throughout his previous struggle to main tain his father's conquests, he displayed all the savage and perfidious cruelty of the more ancient sea-kings. His earliest efforts, after his seizure of the undivided sovereignty of England, were directed to secure his crown against the pretensions of the brothers and infant children of Edmund Ironside. He obtained the assassination of Edwin, the eldest surviving son of the imbecile Ethelred ; he bribed the duke of Normandy to aban don the support of his two young nephews, Edward and Alfred, by a proposal of marriage to their mother Emma ; and the youthful vanity of that princess induced herto reascend the English throne by this unnatural union with the deadly enemy of her first husband, the reputed murderer of one or both of her step-sons, and the usurper of the rights of her own children. With a policy of which the murderous design is open to the heaviest suspicion, Canute had also sent the two in fant sons of Ironside, Edmund and Edward, out of the kingdom, to the charge of his relative or dependent, the king of Sweden. Whatever were his intentions respecting these orphans, the Scandinavian prince was probably impelled by a humane regard for their safety when he transferred them into the hands of Stephen,* king of Hungary, who educated them as if they had been his own offspring. At the court of that good prince the elder died in his youth; but Edward married a daughter of the imperial house of Saxony, who bore him three chil dren, Edgar Atheling, Christina, and Mar garet : the first destined in a life of vicissitude to survive ingloriously the fortunes of his race; and the last, through her marriage with the king of the Scots, to commingle the blood of the line of Cerdic with that of the posterity of our Norman conqueror. While Canute was thus removing the progeny of their native princes from the eyes of the English, he riveted his yoke on their necks by measures equally oppressive and san guinary. To gratify the rapacity of his Danish followers, themost grievous exactions were levied on the people, wdio found them selves treated in every respect as a conquered nation ; many nobles were summarily put to death on real or pretended suspicions of trea son, and their lands were bestowed on chief tains of Northman blood. Among these victims to the fury or policy of Canute was the infamous Edric, whose murder, unlike that of the rest, was hailed by the people as a just retribution for a life of perfidious and manifold treasons against his original sove reigns and benefactors.* Having founded a despotic dominion upon the terror of these examples, the first evi dence of the better resolve of Canute to gain the hearts of his subjugated people by a more benignant rule, is shown in the dismissal of his Northman followers, who treated the English with intolerable oppression. With the exception of a body of three thousand warriors, whom under the name of Huscarles, or Thingmanni, he retained as the household guards of his throne, his farewell donatives of gold encouraged the departure of the host of adventurers by whose aid he had con quered the kingdom; and his Saxon subjects gratefully hailed their deliverance from the presence of those hateful foreigners. The frequent visits which Canute himself subse quently paid to his Scandinavian dominions are still stronger indications of his well founded security in the loyalty of the nation during his absence; and in more than one victorious expedition to the north he was indebted for success to the courage and fidelity of the English forces by which he was attended. The equity of his govern ment, in fact, soon rendered him deservedly popular, while its vigour commanded respect and severely punished disorder. In cultiva- * Chron. Sax. p. 151. Ingulf, p. 58. Flor.

The laws which he published breathe a noble spirit of equity and mercy; and his administration of justice wras impar tially balanced between his Danish and English subjects.* the northern division, including London, being assigned to Harold, and the southern to Hardicanute, until whose return its administration was intrusted to the queen mother, assisted by the ealdorman Godwin. The rise of this chieftain had been rapid ; and before the death of Canute he had become the most influential among the \u00a9 nobles of Wessex. His administration of that kingdom as co-regent with Emma for Hardicanute was shortly disturbed by an invasion which Edward, the eldest of her sons by Ethelred, undertook from Normandy as soon as he learnt the death of Canute. But the queen mother preferred the interest of her offspring by the Northman to those of the children of her first marriage; and the attempt of Edward being promptly repelled, he was driven back to his asylum at the court of Normandy. His flight was followed by the appearance in England of his younger brother, Alfred, who, being lured into the power of his enemies, was murdered, with his followers, under circum stances of horrible barbarity. By the chroniclers of the age, this crime is most generally attributed to a perfidious scheme of Harold, of which Earl Godwin was the suspected accomplice.* Harold, availing himself of the continued and unexplained absence of Hardicanute in Denmark, had now extended his authority into Wessex ; and the flight of Emma into Flanders on learn ing the tragical fate of her neglected son removed every obstacle to his blood-stained triumph. Prevailing upon the nobles of Wessex to desert the cause of Hardicanute, he was elected king of all England; and, after a show of some reluctance on the part of the archbishop of Canterbury, finally received the crown. But his reign lasted only five years, and on his death, Hardi canute, who had just joined his mother in Flanders, was unanimously called by the nation to the throne. His first act was to indulge a brutal and impotent feeling of revenge against his deceased brother for his Canute left three sons, Sweyn, Harold (surnamed Harefoot from his fleetness), and Hardicanute (or Canute the Hardy); the two eldest the offspring of an illegitimate union, the last of his marriage with Emma. On Sweyn, during his own life, he had already bestowed the crown of Norway; and according to the condition of his marriage treaty with Emma, Hardicanute, as her issue, should have inherited the throne of England. But at the moment of his father's death that prince was employed in the government of Denmark, and his absence encouraged his brother Harold to attempt the seizure of the English crown. His pretensions were supported by the Danish guards, and in general by the population of both races north of the Thames. On the other hand, the people of Wessex, who were much attached to Queen Emma, faithfully maintained the cause of her absent son : and the whole kingdom was threatened anew with the horrors of civil wrar.f These impending calamities wrere averted by an accommodation between the parties of the two princes. In a general witenagemote convened at Oxford, it was agreed that the kingdom should be partitioned between the brothers, with the Thames for the boundary : \u2022 Chron. Sax. pp. 151-154.

It was, doubtless, from an insight into these traits of his character that the ambitious Godwin was induced to take an active share in promoting his election to the crown; and in effect, he was no sooner enthroned than the earl and his family began to reign in his name. Although a vow by which the king had bound himself rendered the mar riage only nominal, he was persuaded to make Editha, the fair daughter of Godwin, the partner of his throne; and while that nobleman himself held the extensive govern ment of Wessex, Kent, and Sussex, two other earldoms, one comprising the western provinces between the Severn and the Thames, and the other all the eastern counties, were bestowed upon Sweyn and Harold, his eldest sons. The whole of the south of England was thus immediately subject to the house of Godwin; and its power was imperfectly counterbalanced by that of two other great chieftains, Siward and Leofric, who in the previous reigns had acquired the administration of Northumbria and Mercia, with the same title of earls: a designation borrowed from the Northman term jarls, which, under the Danish dynasty, had silently superseded the old Saxon dignity of ealdorman.* injurious treatment of himself and the queen mother, as well as his murder of Alfred. The remains of Harold were disinterred and decapitated. If Earl Godwin had been really guilty, that powerful nobleman con trived not the less to propitiate the new king by splendid presents; and he was not only allowed to clear himself from the charge of having participated in the murder of Alfred by his own oath and that of his peers, according to the singular forms of Saxon jurisprudence, but was admitted to a large share in the administration of the kingdom. The reign of Hardicanute was even shorter than that of Harold; his con stitution was weakly; and his death was caused by a fit of intoxication during the nuptial revels of one of his nobles. He left no issue ; and by his decease the union of the two crowns of England and Denmark was dissolved (1042). The king of Norway immediately seated himself on the Danish throne, and the English joyfully restored the line of their native sovereigns.* The character of Hardicanute has been variously represented : but his memory deserves the honour of at least one generous and magnanimous act. Notwithstanding \u00a9 \u00a9 the dangerous pretensions of Edward, the surviving son of Ethelred by Emma, to the English crown, he had invited him to his court ; and not only treated him with warm fraternal affection, but seems to have regarded him as his heir. Immediately on his death, therefore, Edward, supported as well by the powerful influence of Godwin as by the ancient affection of the English for the house of Cerdic, which had been rekindled by their hatred of the Danish ascendancy, was placed on the throne without opposition. Edward, whose canonization in the subse quent century has caused him to be distin guished by the surname of \" the Confessor,\" was a prince of excellent intentions, but totally deficient in capacity or energy for the vigorous administration of affairs. All his personal virtues were of an inactive cast ; the Notwithstanding the ascendancy acquired by Godwin and his family over the feeble will of Edward, the king had some strong feelings which rendered him not wholly passive in their hands. His resentment against the Danish party was shown in his conduct towards his mother, whose un natural hostility to himself and his murdered brother in support of her son by Canute had certainly not increased her maternal title to his affection. He seized her treasures, and treated her otherwise with a severity as unbecoming towards a parent as it was foreign to his usual disposition.-)- In these * Chron. Sax. p. 157. Ingulf, p. 62.

His education in Normandy, and the protection which throughout the exile of his youth he had received in that duchy, had singularly endeared its natives to him; and his court was soon filled with Norman adventurers, upon whom he bestowed many of the richest bishoprics and offices of state. The growing influence and power of the Norman courtiers were for some years regarded by the family of Godwin with brooding jealousy: while, probably from opposition to their house, the foreign party was supported by Earls Siward and Leofric. The arrogant demeanour of the earl of Wessex and his five sons had already alienated the favour of Edward, when a brutal outrage of Sweyn, the eldest of the brothers, on the person of the abbess of Leominster, provoked the just indignation of the pious monarch to banish him from the realm (1044). But although the outlaw after wards aggravated his guilt by the murder of his own cousin, Edward had, some time afterwards, the inconceivable weakness to pardon and reinstate him in his possessions ; and not longer after his return his family repaid this clemency by an open rebellion. A murderous affray between the townsmen of Dover and the retinue of Eustace, earl of Boulogne, who had married the king's sister, and had arrived in England on a visit to the court, afforded them the pretext which they desired for rousing popular indignation against the insolence of the foreign favourites of Edward. On the complaint of Eustace, the king ordered Godwin, to whom the town of Dover belonged, to punish his burghers; and the haughty earl not only refused, but, joined by his sons, took up arms to support his disobedience. Edward, who seems to have acted with hasty partiality towards the foreigners, gave a solitary instance of deter mination in their cause. Summoning Earls Siward and Leofric to his aid, he was soon enabled to assemble an army sufficiently powerful to overawe the insurgents; and Godwin was compelled to accept a temperate or politic offer of the royal party to submit the cause of dispute to the judgment of a witenagemote. Some delay in the assemb ling of that body in London was fatal to the cause of the insurgents; their forces dwindled away; and fearing to commit themselves into the hands of their enemies, the father and his five sons took flight, and were all solemnly outlawed by a sentence of their peers. Godwin and three of them escaped to Flanders; Harold and the fifth obtained refuge in Ireland ; and even Queen Editha, as their sister, whose beauty, virtue, and mental accomplishments are equally extolled by her contemporaries, shared their dis grace, and was placed under confinement in a monastery (1051).* At this critical juncture the king received a visit, which subsequent events rendered memorable, from his cousin, William, duke of Normandy, whose illegitimate birth had not prevented his succession to his father's states, and whose vigorous government had already marked him for one of the most able princes of the time. The fears of the foreign courtiers of Edward had urged him to en treat the assistance of the duke in the late emergency; and although his succour was no longer needed, the future conqueror of England landed with an imposing train, and was received with great distinction by the king. The Norman party, however, did not long enjoy their triumph. In the following year Earl Godwin, by the negli gent disbandment of the royal squadron appointed to watch his motions, was en couraged to return in force from Flanders; and being joined by his son Harold from Ireland, he entered the Thames, and boldly ascended the river to London. The return of the outlawed earls was enthusiastically welcomed by their party, now swelled in numbers by the increasing popular aversion to the strangers; and the king, although at the head of an army in the capital, was * Chron.

[a.d. 1065. 96 prince, and renewing their ancient oaths of allegiance and tribute.* By the glory of this expedition, Harold much enhanced his reputation and popu larity; and from his compelling the Welsh princes to swear fealty to himself as well as to the king, it may be suspected that he already aspired to the throne. But this triumph was followed by two events, each in a different degree unfavourable to his hopes. The king invited his nephew the Atheling Edward, son of Edmund Ironside, from Hungary to reside in England; and the arrival of the princely exile, with his wife and family, was hailed with popular acclamation. As the design of the childless monarch in recalling this sole remaining branch of the house of Cerdic was evidently to nominate the Atheling his successor, the landing of that prince on his native shores was an ominous event for the fortunes of Harold ; and the sudden death of so danger ous a rival, even before he could obtain admission into the presence of his royal uncle, cast some dark though probably undeserved suspicions on the powerful and ambitious noble whose elevation to the throne would have been obstructed by his existence. Whether guilty or innocent, Harold was a gainer by the event; and the youth of Edgar, the eldest son of the Athel ing, equally with the feebleness of spirit which his dawning manhood betrayed, ren dered him the most harmless of rivals. But compelled by his nobles to accept the submission of Godwin. The great earl and his sons, with the exception of Sweyn, were restored to their dignities and possessions ; and the foreign chief tains and prelates, being in their turn outlawed by the fickle judgment of a witenagemote, fled in all quarters, and with difficulty effected their escape from the kingdom.* The family of Godwin now became again all-powerful; the queen was restored from her monastic seclusion to the throne; and Edward resigned himself helplessly to the dominion of her relatives. The death of Godwin, which soon followed, served rather to exalt than diminish the fortunes of his house. Sweyn, the eldest son, who had submitted without a struggle to the sentence of banishment pronounced upon him on account of the brutal murders he had com mitted, died during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which he had undertaken through remorse for his crimes ; and Harold, whose reputation was untainted with the suspected or notorious guilt of his father or brother, and who possessed many generous qualities which rendered him the popular idol, now united in his person the chief power and honours of the family. His superior influence, and his jealousy of the great rival house of Leofric, earl of Mercia, were shown by a sentence of banishment which he obtained from the witenagemote against Algar, the son of Leofric, on some treasonable charge. The outlaw, indeed, with the aid of the Welsh, excited a rebellion which was terminated in a compromise ; and Algar, on the decease of his father, by alter nate negotiation and force, made good his succession to the earldom. But on the death of Algar (1059) Harold took a signal vengeance on his Welsh allies, and leading the royal forces into their country, pene trated its remotest fastnesses, and obliged the natives to seek the mercy of Edward by delivering up the head of Griffith their Harold was soon afterwards thrown into the power of a competitor of far other character. While at sea in the British Channel, on some excursion of business or pleasure, of which the uncertain object is variously related, Harold had the misfortune to be wrecked on the French coast, near the mouth of the river Somme, in the territory of Guy, count of Ponthieu ; and being made captive, according to the barbarous local custom, was delivered up by the count to William, duke of Normandy. That prince, ungenerously using his power over the * Ingulf, p. 65. Chron Sax. pp. 165, 168. Flor. Wig. pp. 412, 414. ' Ingulf, pp. 66-68. Chron. Sax. pp. 168, 169. Malms bury, p. 81. Flor.

He hastened to the scene of revolt : but the strength of the insurgents was already too formidable to be subdued by force; and they turned a deaf ear to all Harold's attempts to palliate the faults of his brother, and his promises that Tostig would behave for the future with justice and moderation if they would receive him back as their earl, declaring, \" We were born free men, and were brought up in free dom ; a proud chief is to us unbearable, for we have learned from our ancestors to live free or die.\" Finding them immovable, Harold, either convinced of the justice of their cause or induced by a politic regard for his own interests, abandoned the support of his brother, and acquiesced in the choice of the Northumbrians, who had raised Morcar, the son of Algar of Mercia, to their earldom in his place. Tostig, thus converted into the inveterate enemy both of his brother and his country, fled to Bruges, the court of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, whose daughter he had married, and Harold returned to London to await the death of the king, who had been long declining in health, and who breathed his last a few weeks afterwards, on the 5th of January, 1066, in the sixty-fifth year of his age and twenty-fourth of his reign.* The truth of the assertions by which William of Normandy claimed the succes sion to the crown of England, was doubtful to his contemporaries, and modern contro versy has vainly presumed to resolve the uncertainty. According to the statement of the duke himself, or of the Norman chroniclers, his pretensions rested on no more than verbal declarations of Edward, that he designed to make him his heir ; and these announcements, if made before the royal invitation to the Atheling Edward, must have been revoked by the arrival of that prince in England, and renewed after his death. Of hereditary right the Norman, of course, had not a shadow ; and even if his own statements were in all respects true, neither the bequest of Edward nor the oath of Harold could give him the slightest claim to the crown of England, because the assembled witan of the realm alone had any right to dispose of it. But by universal, although tacit consent, the personal inca pacity of the young Atheling Edgar, the true lineal heir to the crown, excluded all idea of his succession; and the alleged bequest of the aged king was to form the contested title of two rival claimants who, although both connected with him by marriage, were equally aliens from his blood. Harold, from his presence at the court, was enabled to obtain the last testament of his sovereign. The memory of this prince, the last sovereign of the ancient Saxon line, was long afterwards affectionately cherished by the English, who too partially contrasted the mildness or rather imbecility of his government with the iron oppression of their Norman conquerors. But the only real benefit which he conferred upon his subjects was the remission of the oppressive tax of the Danegelt ; and as this appears to have been the spontaneous and immediate boon of his own humane temper, it is the * Guilelmus Pictaviensis, pp. 77-85. Matt. Paris, p. 2. Matt. West. p. 426. Ingulf, p. 68. According to the story told by the Norman writers, Harold was basely entrapped by William into swearing on a concealed vessel filled with the relics of the saints ; and there can be no doubt that it was the alleged crime of profaning the relics of the saints which, more than anything else, turned the tide of opinion on the Continent against Harold, and gave to the Norman invasion of England something of the character of a crusade. * Chron.

Some portion also of the popular affection in which the memory of Edward was held, may be attrib uted to the freedom of the kingdom, during his life, from those miseries of foreign domi nation which had preceded his accession, and which followed his death. At the outset of his reign the country was threatened with invasion by Magnus, king of Denmark, who, as the successor of Hardicanute, claimed the English crown ; but his project was arrested by death, and the only foreign hostilities in which Edward was ever involved were directed against Macbeth, the usurper of the Scottish throne.f Duncan, king of Scots, whom Macbeth had murdered, was brother-in-law of Siward, earl of North- umberland ; and Malcolm, his eldest son, took refuge with his uncle. For fifteen years the usurper held possession of the Scottish throne, until Siward obtained per mission of Edward to support the cause of his nephew with an English army, slew Macbeth, and restored Malcolm to his father's throne. Whatever intentions Edward had ex pressed in favour of the duke of Normandy, Harold prevailed upon the king, when on his deathbed, to nominate him as his suc cessor ; and immediately after the royal demise he procured his own election as king by the witan of all England. Tested, therefore, by the recognized principles and customs of the age, Harold's title to the throne was every way valid. The claims of the Atheling Edgar to the succession were disregarded ; and the coronation of the new sovereign was celebrated by Archbishop Ealdred on the following day, on which the obsequies of Edward were also per formed. But the festivities of this ill-omened ceremony were destined to be immediately and disastrously interrupted by foreign ambi tion and fraternal hatred; and we may appro priately pause at an event which, ushering in the vicissitudes of a brief but bloody struggle, produced the Norman Conquest of England.* CHAPTER III. from the norman conquest to the death of william the conqueror, a.d. 1066\u20141087. \u2014 William's expedition to England \u2014 Norwegian invasion \u2014 battle of Hastings, and death of harold norman tyranny and saxon insurrections edgar atheltng and his sisters cruel tyranny of william earls edwdj and morcar invasion of scotland by william conspiracy against him earl waltheof domesday- book dissensions among william's sons insurrection of the northumbrians William's illness, death, and character.

William was the illegitimate son of Duke Robert the Magnificent, the fourth in descent from the redoubtable an- cestor of the Normans, by Harlette, daughter of a tanner at Falaise.* He was born in 1027. Robert was married to the sister of Canute, but had no legitimate issue; and when in 1035 he was about to set out on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, his barons viewed the proposed departure with alarm, and complained that he would leave them without a head. \" By my faith,\" replied the duke, \" I will not leave you without a head. I have a little bastard, who by God's bless- ing will grow up in due season ; and if you will now make choice of him, I will asso- ciate him in the duchy as my successor.\" In compliance with this request, the Norman barons, because, as they said, it suited them so to do, took the oath of fealty to the boy; and Duke Robert having died in the course of the same year at Nice, in Bithynia, while on his return from Palestine, his son, though only eight years of age, was at once placed upon the ducal throne. During his minority the turbulence of the Norman barons, and the aggressions of the French king on the independence and rights of the duchy, reduced Normandy to a perilous state of anarchy and weakness. But as soon as the young prince came to maturity he set him- self vigorously, and somewhat mercilessly, to repress internal disturbances and to repel foreign invasion ; and by his combined courage and sagacity succeeded in making himself respected and feared by all the neighbouring princes, and established a degree of order in his duchy unknown at that time in the rest of Europe. His marriage to Matilda, daughter of the opulent count of Flanders, whom, if we may believe an old chronicler, he wooed in true Muscovite fashion, with fists, heels, and spur-rowels, added considerably to his influence ; and the hope that he might one day succeed to the crown of England seems at an early stage to have dawned upon his mind. Edward the Confessor, who at this period filled the Eng lish throne, was the grandson of one of the dukes of Normandy. He had no children, and his marked attachment to the young duke of Normandy seemed to assure his adoption and succession to the crown. In 1051, as we have seen, William paid a friendly visit to his kinsman, who received him with great honour, and, as it is alleged, hinted to him before his departure his intention of adopt ing him as his heir. Having extorted an oath of allegiance from Harold, the king's brother-in-law, his only formidable rival, he no doubt regarded his accession to the throne on the death of the Confessor as secure. But whatever Edward's previous intentions may have been, on his dcathbed he nominated Harold as his successor; and the Saxon earl at once ascended the vacant throne (6th January, 1066), with the apparent hearty consent both of the nobles and of the people of England. William was no sooner informed of the death of his royal kinsman Edward, and of the seizure of the English crown by Harold, than he immediately resolved to enforce his own pretended claims to the succession. His first measure was to despatch a Norman monk as his envoy to England, to insist upon the intentions of the late king in his savour, to protest against the usurpation of Harold, and to demand of that prince the fulfilment of the vows of fealty and service which he had so recently sworn. It was easy to anti cipate the indignant reply of Harold. He denied both the obligation of oaths which had been extorted in his captivity, and the validity of forced promises to assist in con ferring a crown which had not been his to bestow. He vindicated the sufficiency of * Robert, struck with the beauty of the daughter of his chatelain at Falaise, with whom he had danced at an enter tainment in her father's castle, signified to his host a wish that the partnership of the evening should not terminate with the ball; a request which, according to the gross fashion of the times, a vassal esteemed a compliment from his lord. The father, however, willing to preserve his daughter's honour, substituted in her place the fair Harlette, nothing loth at the exchange; and who so far mastered the duke's affections, as not to feel alarm at the revelation which morning brought with it, and to banish all rivalry for the future. (Chronicon Alberici Trium Fontium ad ann. 1035, ap. Bouquet, xi. 350.) William of Malmsbury says that it was the dancing of Har lette herself which enchanted the duke."], [138, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1066. 100 his own subsequent title to the throne in the free election of his countrymen ; and declared his determination to maintain the common rights and independence of his new subjects and himself by the sword.* The preparations of the duke of Normandy were fatally assisted by the deadly enmity which Harold had excited in the bosom of his own brother. That noble was Tostig, the deprived earl of Northumbria, who, repairing to the court of William from his exile in Flanders, offered, on conditions which are not stated, to co-operate in the invasion of England by inducing some of the Scandinavian princes to make a simul- taneous descent upon the northern coast. William eagerly accepted the proposal; and Tostig, though he failed in his persuasions upon the king of Denmark, gained a pro- mise of powerful support from Haralld Har- drada, king of Norway. Without waiting for the arrival, however, of that sovereign, the exiled earl, himself collecting some sixty vessels in the ports of Flanders, appeared in the English Channel, and commenced hos- tilities by plundering the Isle of Wight. The approach of his brother with a superior fleet admonished him to direct his course northward; and he next attempted a land- ing on the eastern coast in Lindesey: but there, being vigorously encountered by the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, he was defeated with so much loss, that he was abandoned by his followers, and compelled to fly for refuge to one of the ports of Scot- land, where Malcolm Canmore, the reigning prince, gave him protection until the arrival of his Norwegian confederates. The summer was far advanced before Haralld Hardrada had collected the promised armament, but the amount of its force of three hundred sail explained the delay in the magnitude of the preparation; and the Norwegian sovereign, leading his fleet and army in person, and depositing his queen and daughters, who had come over with him, in the Orkney islands for safety, at length joined the out law Tostig off the Northumbrian shore.* aggrandizement over the thrones of Europe, which the popes had already formed, in Hume's supposition (History of England, vol. i. p. 247) that Alexander II. hoped, by promoting the duke of Normandy's success, to bring the English church under closer subjection to the papacy than had yet been effected. * Chron. Sax. p. 172. Ordericus Vitalis, p 492. Guil. Gemtneticensis, p. 285. Malmsbury, p. 94. Snorre (Hist. Regain Norveg.), vol. iii. pp. 146-150. That this, indeed, alone must be the arbiter of their pretensions, both rivals were already fully aware; and on both sides the vain interchange of verbal formalities was instantly followed by the most active pre parations for war. These, on the part of William, were of a magnitude less suitable to the narrow resources of his duchy than to the importance of an enterprise which was in every respect the mightiest effort of the age. To levy a great army adequate to the con quest of the English kingdom, he relied not so much merely on the services of his Nor man subjects as on the renown of his own personal prowess and talents, on the martial spirit of adventure which animated the feudal nobility of France, and on the temptation which, under his able guidance, the expedi tion itself would offer to their ambition and cupidity. That the additional incentive of a religious sanction to the war might not be wanting, he further, everywhere proclaiming Harold his perjured vassal, was careful to seek the papal countenance for his own pre tensions; and from Pope Alexander II., to whom by an embassy he adroitly appeared to submit the justice of his quarrel, he suc ceeded in obtaining a pontifical bull, together with the present of a consecrated standard for the expedition, and a ring of great price, containing, it was alleged, one of the hairs of St. Peter. Thus while, on the one hand, Harold was represented as a forsworn and traitorous usurper, who had violated the most solemn obligations of religion and honour; on the other, the claims of William acquired a twofold aspect of strength and legitimacy in the protection and approval of the church.f \u2022 Matt.

Dr. Lingard (History of England, vol. i. p. 442) is willing to doubt whether this present of a consecrated banner might be more than \"a return of politeness on the part of the pontiff.\" But it is very unlikely that so solemn an offer ing should have been made in mere compliment ; and there is much more consistency with the views of temporal"], [139, "a.d. 1066.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 101 Meanwhile Harold had neglected no mea sure to improve his questionable title, and to strengthen his insecure position on the English throne ; and he was already prepared to defend the crown which he had seized with an energy and courage equal to his ambition. In the southern parts of the kingdom, where his family influence had long been established, and his personal popularity was unbounded, his authority had been at once joyfully recognized. \" He studied by all means,\" says an old chronicler, \" which way to win the people's favour, and omitted no occasion whereby he might show any token of bounteous liberality, gentle ness, and courteous behaviour towards them. The grievous customs also and taxes which his predecessors had raised he either abolished or diminished; the ordinary wages of his servants and men of war he increased, and further showed himself very well bent to all virtue and goodness.\" Another writer, who lived near that period, states that from the moment of his accession ' Harold showed himself pious, humble, and affable ; and that he spared himself no fatigue, either by land or by sea, for the defence of his country. He was without doubt a remarkably able man, a brave and skilful general, and a wise, just, and vigorous ruler. His first act after his coronation was to undertake a journey into the north, in the course of which, by his bland and politic demeanour, he overcame some reluctance which the Northumbrians had shown to his accession, and apparently gained their affections. In the same visit he further secured the adherence of the the news of the appearance of the king of Norway and his armament, in concert with Tostig, on the coast of Northumberland; and his first intimation of danger from that \u00a9 quarter was quickly followed by further accounts of the landing of the confederates in the Humber, of the defeat and flight of Earls Edwin and Morcar, after a vain effort to arrest the advance of the invaders to York, and of the surrender of that city to the Nor wegian prince. Roused, but still undis mayed, by the report of a calamity which so unexpectedly distracted his attention and aggravated his peril, Harold, with instant decision, broke up from his camp at Peven sey, and hastened with his troops to the north by forced marches to meet and repel the invaders. Such was the rapidity of his movements, that he reached the vicinity of York four days only after the battle in which the Northumbrian earls had been overthrown, and found the king of Norway and his brother Tostig unconscious of his approach, and employed in securing the fruits of their vic tory. As soon as the confederates perceived his arrival, they abandoned their conquests, and slowly retired to concentrate their scat tered forces, until they reached Stamford on the river Derwent, where the Norwegian king ranged his forces in battle array, and awaited the assault of the English. The encounter which followed was deemed memorable even in Scandinavian song by its surpassing slaughter ; and the distinction obtained by its fatal event in the Norse traditions is attested in the minuteness with which its particulars have been collected and related by the earliest among the national annalists of that people. The Norwegian army was drawn out in the form of a hollow ellipse, with the royal standard, under the tremendous designation of the \" Scather of Lands,\" in the centre. The ranks were dense ; the shields of the warriors over lapped ; and the deficiency in cavalry, which their debarkation from a long voyage had been too recent to supply, was as much as possible repaired by covering the whole ex terior of the circle against the charge of the powerful family of Algar (whose two sons, Edwin and Morcar, now held the great earldoms of Mercia and Northumbria) by marrying their sister Editha. Returning to London, and assembling the national forces of the southern provinces, after chasing Tostig with his fleet out of the channel, he took up a position with his army on the coast between Hastings and Pevensey, and there vigilantly waited the threatened descent of the duke of Normandy. It was in this situation that he received"], [140, "102 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 10GG. Saxon horse with a row of spears, firmly planted in the earth and pointed towards the assailants. The King Hardrada himself, distinguished by his lofty stature, his re splendent helmet, and his mantle of blue, was riding; in front of the line when his \u00a9 charger fell under him. Harold saw the accident, and inquired the rank of the war rior. Being informed that it was the Nor wegian king, he observed, \" His form is majestic: but his fall portends his approach ing fate.\" Before the armies closed, Harold sent a messenger to Tostig, with a tender of the earldom of Northumbria if he would come over from the Norwegian camp. \" The offer,\" said the exile, \" is well; and if made last winter, might have saved the lives of many brave men : but, should I now accept it, what will Harold give to the king of Norway?\" \" Seven feet of earth for a grave, or, as he is above the common stature of men, it may be a little more ! \" Tostig, in reply to this taunt, as contemptuously spurned the proposal to abandon his ally. \" Ride back, ride back,\" he cried, \" and bid King Harold make ready for the fight. When the Northmen tell the story of this day they shall never say that Earl Tostig forsook King Hardrada, the son of Sigurd. He and I have one mind and one resolve, and that is, either to die in battle or to pos sess all England.\" Harold, on this, imme diately led his troops to the attack. But so firm and close was the array of the Norwe gians, that the first furious onset of the Saxons was repulsed on all sides ; their cavalry were unable to penetrate the line of implanted spears; and the assailants began to retire in confusion. At this critical moment the Norwegians, in the confidence of victory, were tempted to quit their van tage ground and rushed forward in pursuit: but their dense order was no sooner loosened than the Saxon horse, returning to the charge and bursting through the intervals, carried havoc into the centre of the broken host ; and at the same moment Hardrada received his mortal wound from an arrow. Tostig, now taking the command, bravely supplied his place; and the event was sus pended for a brief season by the arrival of a reinforcement of Norsemen from their fleet. But the resistance of the routed army, though desperate, was unavailing ; and the death of Tostig, who was slain after indignantly rejecting the renewed offers of his brother, terminated the struggle. The slower of the Norwegian nobles had perished with their monarch ; and half a century afterwards the piles of human bones which bleached on the plain still recorded the immensity of the slaughter. But some remains of the Norwegian host accepted the mercy of the conqueror; and the humanity and generosity of Harold were as conspicuous in success as his gallantry and conduct had been in the field. The capture of the Nor wegian fleet, which was an immediate con- \u00a9 * sequence of the victory of Stamford, placed the widowed family and retinue of Hardrada in his power : but instead of adding the misery of captivity to their late misfortunes, he sent for Olave, the youthful son of the deceased monarch ; contented himself with requiring an oath in the name of the Nor wegian nation to abstain from further hos tilities against England ; and placing the young prince with all his family and surviv ing followers in some of their own ships, nobly dismissed them, unransomed and un injured, to their native land. After thus gloriously consummating his triumph, Harold returned to York, as well to refresh his exhausted troops with some season of repose, as to receive the joyous congratulations of the loyal citizens ; and here he was still feasting with his faithful nobles when the banquet was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of intelligence that the duke of Normandy and his host, four days after the battle of Stamford, had accomplished their landing on the southern coast* By its composition and force, the army with which William of Normandy had effected his descent on the English shores * Chron. Sax. p. 172. Flor. Wig. p. 429. Ingulf, p. 69. Hunt, pp 367, 368. Malmsburv, p. 94. Snorre, vol. iii. pp. 151-165."], [141, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1066.] 103 was probably the most formidable which Europe had seen collected since the settle ment of the Gothic nations. Such was the eagerness with which the nobles of France \u00a9 and the adjacent provinces of the Low Countries and Germany, and even of Pied mont, with their feudal retainers, flocked to his standard, that he found himself at the head of fifty thousand mailed cavalry, led by the flower of the European knighthood, and attended by a body of ten thousand archers and other footmen.* The number of vessels of all sizes provided for the transport of this great army across the British Channel is variously estimated by different chroniclers at from one thousand to three thousand;! and during several months every port on the Norman coast had resounded with notes of preparation. In August, some weeks before the Norwegian invasion of England, the naval equipments were completed, the shipping concentrated at the mouth of the River Dive, and the troops in readiness to embark: but adverse winds had fortunately prevented the armament from sailing until the Saxon fleet, which Harold had stationed in the channel to oppose the passage, was compelled to disperse for want of provisions \u2014 and untd that prince and his army had marched against the Norwegians, and left the southern coast totally unguarded. With the first favourable change of wind William impatiently put to sea: but the elements themselves now appeared to war against .him ; a violent storm arose, and many of his vessels were stranded on the French coast, with heavy losses of men and stores, before the armament succeeded in reaching St. Valori, near Dieppe. Here the duke, to allay the superstitious fears with which his followers began to be affected by so ominous a prelude to their enterprise, caused the aid of heaven to be invoked by a procession of the relics of St. Valori and by the public prayers of the army. It was on the eve of the feast of St. Michael, the tutelary saint of Normandy, that these supplications were made; and the wind suddenly moderating and changing to a favourable breeze, the soldiery joyfully hailed the coincidence as an assurance of the Divine favour. The duke at once took advantage of their recovered spirit. The fleet setting sail immediately stretched across the channel; its course was continued throughout the night; the morning discovered the English shore; and on Michaelmas day the whole army disembarked without opposition at a place called Bulverhithe, between Pevensey and Hastings in Sussex. * William was the last man to land, and as his foot touched the sand it slipped and he fell upon his face. Alarmed at this mishap, the soldiers cried out \" God keep us ! but here is a bad sign.\" The duke's presence of mind, however, did not forsake him, and leaping briskly to his feet and showing his hand full of English earth or sand, he exclaimed, \" AVhat now ! What astonishes you ! I have taken seisin of this land with my hands, and by the splendour of God, as far as it extends it is mine \u2014 it is yours ! \" The first motions of William after his landing were marked by a prudent regard to the security of his future operations. Marching along the coast to Hastings, he threw up works both at that port and at Pevensey for the protection of his shipping ; and the appearance of the English fleet in superior force soon proved the necessity of such defences. He caused the adjacent country to be scoured for provisions ; and as if anticipating the rashness of his opponent, and unwilling to engage his own forces in a decisive encounter out of reach of the coast, he lingered in its vicinity to observe the proceedings of Harold.

Consulting only the high dictates of his magnanimous courage, he advanced to the vicinity of the Norman camp, and posted his army in a strong position on a wooded eminence facing the invaders, about nine miles from Hastings \u2014 a spot which then bore the name of Senlac, but was afterwards termed Battle. Here William, who trusting to the superior equipment, skill, and discipline of his forces, desired nothing more than the opportunity of deciding the war in a general battle, immediately prepared to attack him. If we may believe an often-quoted authority, the brief suspense of a single night was passed by the two armies in a widely different manner: by the English in feasting and noisy mirth, by the Normans in the solemn silence of devotional exercises* But the assertion is not supported by any credible evidence. It is certainly strange enough, as it has been said, that one should never be told of William and his followers being seized with so exemplary a fit of devotion, except on the eve of the battle of Hastings. activity which had been crowned with such complete success against the king of Nor way; but he had now to contend with an adversary far more dangerous by his skill and resources. Hastening by long marches from York, the instant that he heard of the Norman descent, and directing the forces of the southern parts of the kingdom to assemble in London, he found himself, in a few days after his arrival in that capital, at the head of an army sufficiently numerous to cope with the invaders. By Saxon writers, naturally anxious to ascribe the subsequent calamities of their race to any cause rather than to the superior prowess of their conquerors, he is accused of having provoked the disgust and occasioned the desertion of his troops in the north, by his avarice in denying them the spoils of the Norwegians; not a few of his men, it is said, were left behind by the rapidity of his march, from fatigue and the effects of their wounds; and it is alleged that, thus weakened by the loss of his veteran bands, he presumptuously risked the safety of his crown and the independence of his country by rushing to the encounter with a raw and unexercised army, hastily levied and inade quate in numbers.* But the confidence with which Harold had been inspired by recent victory, may find its justification even in the duration and obstinacy of the last fatal struggle ; and the enormous slaughter which the Saxons inflicted upon their con querors seems in itself to refute the tale of numerical disparity. With the earliest dawn of the memorable day which was to exercise a most momentous influence on the future destiny of England, Saturday, the 14th of October, William drew out his host. His half-brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, wearing an episcopal rochet over a coat of mail, celebrated mass and gave his benediction to the troops. The army was divided into three columns of attack. In the van were posted the archers and other lightly armed foot; for their support, and immediately in their rear, were formed the heavier mail-clad infantry; and in a third line, of which both wings extended far beyond the flanks of the foot, were arrayed, with William himself at their head, the whole numerous force of the Norman, French, and Flemish chivalry, the nerve and trust of his enterprise. The duke, mounted on a fine Spanish horse, and wear ing suspended round his neck some of those revered relics upon which Harold had sworn, Whatever were the errors of the Saxon prince, it is admitted that in the crisis of his fate he displayed a spirit worthy of the occasion. To the superstitious anxiety of his brave brothers that, as he had unfortu nately sworn allegiance to the Norman, he should evade the guilt of perjury by absent ing himself from the field, he turned a deaf ear; to the haughty demand of William that he should either resign the crown, submit his title to the arbitration of the pope, or meet him in single combat, he calmly replied * Malmsbury, pp. 94-100.

A great booty is before us, for if we conquer we shall all be rich ; what I gain you will gain ; if I take this land you will have it in lots among you. Know ye, however, that I am not come hither solely to take what is my due, but also to avenge our whole nation for the felonies, perjuries, and treachery of these English. They massacred our kinsmen the Danes\u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 on the night of St. Brice ; they murdered the knights and good men who accompanied Prince Alfred from Normandy, and made my cousin Alfred expire in torture. Before you is the son of that Earl Godwin who was charged with these murders. Let us forward and punish them, with God to our aid.\" The consecrated papal banner was borne aloft in the van of the Normans by a knight named Tonstan, and surnamed \"the \"White,\" or \"the Fair;\" and on the signal of attack, the army, raising the chant of Roland, the fabled Norman paladin of Charlemagne, eagerly moved forward towards the Saxon position. The order in which Harold had resolved to await the assault was prudently regulated by regard to the superiority of the invaders in cavalry. He had arrayed his whole army on foot in one compact mass on the brow of the hill, himself with his brothers Gurth and Leofwin setting the example by dismounting from their horses ; the flanks and rear were covered by woods and intrenchments, and the front presented a bristling and imper- vious surface of spears and battle-axes. In the van, their long arrogated post of honour, stood the men of Kent; the citizens of London also -enjoyed their ancient privilege of guarding the royal standard, which occu pied the centre ;* and beside it stood the king and his brothers, Gurth and Leofwin, with a body of the bravest thanes of England. A gigantic Norman called Taillefcr, a minstrel as well as a warrior, craved per- mission to strike the first blow, and spring- ing his horse to the front of the vanguard, he ran one Saxon through the body and felled another to the ground before he received his mortal wound. As the hostile armies closed to the encounter, they set up their respective war-cries : the English, \" The Holy Rood, the Rood of God;\" the Normans, \" The Lord is our help.\" The onset of the invaders was fierce and impet- uous; its reception firm and undaunted. When the Norman archers had delivered their flight of arrows, they made way for the advance of the more heavily armed infantry : but the effort of these troops upon the Saxon front was repelled with immediate slaughter ; and the contest only became dubious when the Norman knighthood, led by the duke himself to the support of the foot, rushed in one immense body upon the English line. The physical weight of this mass of iron-clad chivalry, the solid array of the Saxon foot, and the common desper- ation of both hosts, rendered their collision tremendous. But favoured by the advantage of their elevated position, their serried order, and their steady footing, the English sus- tained the shock in impenetrable strength. The furious charge of the Norman horse broke and recoiled before the points of their projecting spears; and their sharp and pon- derous battle-axes cut with dreadful execu- tion through the strongest armour of the riders. Repulsed and dismayed, the assail- ants everywhere began to give way. Great numbers were driven back to a deep trench covered over with brushwood and grass, into which horses and riders fell pell-mell and perished. For a moment there was a general panic, and a total rout seemed imminent, for a cry spread that their leader himself had fallen. But in this hour of need William showed himself gifted with all the courage of a hero, and all the calm- ness of a great commander. Removing his helmet to display his countenance, he galloped along the broken lines, exclaiming * On this spot the Conqueror afterwards erected a monas tery in celebration of his victory, Battle Abbey; the original splendour of which is still attested by very extensive remains. 14"], [144, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The combat began at nine o'clock in the morning, and the sun was now setting upon the ensanguined field; no less than fifteen thousand of the Normans had swelled its slaughter; William himself had had three horses killed under him; and all the valour that his personal efforts and example could inspire, all the expedients which his skill could suggest, only held the event in suspense, until it was decided by the random shot of an arrow which pierced the eye and entered the brain of the Saxon prince. His fall spread an immediate panic, which favoured a last charge of the Norman horse ; twenty cavaliers who had sworn to capture the royal standard succeeded, notwithstanding the loss of half their numbers, in penetrating to the spot and seized their prize \u2014 Gurth, who was at the foot of the standard, \" with out hope but without fear,\" fell, it is said, by the falchion of William himself; the English banner was cast down, and the consecrated banner sent from Rome planted in its place announced the triumph of the invaders. The English, as the shades of night closed upon the combat, broke and fled in all directions. They were pursued for some time with merciless car nage: yet even in their flight some bands held bravely together \u2014 especially the men of Kent and the East Angles \u2014 and made a desperate attempt to rally and retrieve the fight. The victors, entangled in the ditches by which the country was inter sected, suffered severely in the pursuit from the vengeful despair of the van quished. But William, unconscious of fatigue and unsatiated with slaughter, still urged his cavalry upon the track of their reluctant retreat; his ardour animated his followers to complete the hardly earned victory, and darkness alone saved the remains of the defeated army.* aloud that he yet lived, and by the blessing of God he yet would conquer. His indig nant menaces to the fugitives arrested their flight; his presence, his voice, and his exer tions rallied the wavering spirit and restored the confidence of his whole host. But all his efforts might still have been vain if the English, in the ardour of success and the recklessness of their courage, had not, unmindful of recent experience, com mitted the same error which had proved so fatal to their Norwegian enemies. Instead of remaining firm on their own ground, numbers broke from their ranks to chase the Norman horse down the hill. In the same instant in which the duke succeeded in rallying his followers, he wheeled them round upon their pursuers, now disordered and breathless, and cutting them off to a man, took a bloody vengeance for his repulse. Still the main body of the English stood immovable; and a second general onset of the Norman chivalry proved equally unavail ing and disastrous with the first. But hopeless of breaking the hostile phalanx by any direct attack, William was now stimu lated by despair to practise upon the rashness which had already betrayed a portion of the English to their destruction. He ordered the count of Boulogne, with a thousand horse, to make a feint of charging a third time; but on reaching the English line to flee as if in confusion. The stratagem o succeeded: again the English incautiously pursued; and again were they intercepted and mowed down by another division of cavalry before they could regain their posi tion. Yet once more, such was the want of discipline and the overweening confidence of the English, a similar artifice was success fully tried, and a similar penalty paid for their temerity. But notwithstanding their disasters, the centre of the English army, where Harold commanded and fought, was firm and un shaken.

So equally was it contested, that the death of Harold* seems alone to have turned the scale of victory ; and but for the fall of the Saxon prince, it may be doubted whether, after so tremendous a conflict, the diminished forces of his rival would have sufficed for the successful prosecution of the work of conquest. By the Norman chroni clers it is acknowledged that one-fourth part of the -victorious army had perished in the field : the amount of the English loss is not \u00a9 stated. But though in the battle and the pursuit the slaughter was probably greater than that in the Norman ranks, and though it is said to have included all the nobility of the south of England, the military force of the northern provinces was yet entire; the kingdom itself remained unsubdued; and the ancient experience of the Danish wars had shown that the national inde pendence might survive a hundred defeats. By Saxon writers, therefore, the panic with which the loss of a single army now filled their race is regarded as a special work of Providence to deliver them into the hands of their enemies. t The death of their prince was an irretrievable misfortune; for no leader of sufficient ability or influence was left to succeed him. The two great northern earls, Edwin and Morcar, who had followed Harold from York too late to share his defeat, endeavoured, indeed, on their arrival in London, to uphold the national cause by placing the crown on the head of its legitimate heir, the Atheling Edgar. But the same youthful incapacity which had made it easy for Harold to set aside the pretensions of that last descendant of the house of Cerdic, rendered the Atheling utterly incompetent to sustain the falling fortunes of his country. William, however, was, it seems, at first far from considering the contest as decided. In addition to his heavy losses in the battle, his army was still further weakened by the alarming preva lence of dysentery; and before he ventured to advance towards the capital, he hastened to secure a place of safety for the reception of his sick and reinforcements from the Continent, by the capture of the castle of Dover. That impregnable fortress, the lock and key of all England, as Holinshed terms it, was surrendered on his first appear ance before it \u2014 not without strong sus picions of treachery on the part of the Saxon commander. After spending eight or nine days in strengthening the fortifica tions of the castle, and repairing the injury done to the town by his brutal and rapacious troops, William directed his march upon London. Though his cavalry easily dis persed a body of the armed citizens, he found the gates of the capital closed against him; and hesitating to tempt the dubious issue of an assault upon the walls, he con tented himself with burning the suburb of Southwark, and drew off his troops to ravage the adjacent counties. Detach ments from his army spread themselves over a wide tract of country, burning towns and villages and massacring men, armed and unarmed alike, together with helpless women; while William himself established an entrenched camp near Wallingford, in order to cut off any succours that might be sent to London from the west, and then took up a position at Berkhampstead for the purpose of interrupting all communication with the capital from the north. The good * The dead body of Harobi was found after the battle and brought to the Norman camp. It is singular that, while Malmsbury (p. 102), and later Saxon writers after him, attribute to William an act of generosity in delivering the corpse of the fallen prince for interment to his mother without ransom, the authorities in the Norman interest assert that the Conqueror barbarously refused her offer of its weight in gold for that melancholy gratification, and ordered the body to be ignominiously buried on the sea-shore: whence, however, it was afterwards removed to the church at Waltham which Harold had founded.

[a.d. 1066. 108 London, William encamped with the rest at some distance from the city until the stronghold was ready for his reception, when he immediately took possession of it and made arrangements for his coronation. His policy, meantime, was mild and con ciliating, and while he omitted no precau tions to secure his government against treachery and revolt, he seemed anxious by the equity of his administration to reconcile the natives to a foreign yoke. Although he proceeded to confiscate the estates of Harold and his brothers, Gurth and Leofwin, and of many of his adherents who had fallen in the late battle, and gratified his principal Norman followers with the spoil, he left to the English nobles in general the undis turbed possession of their property. Many of them, including the Atheling Edgar, he continued or installed in high offices of state and trust; to the citizens of London he granted several new and important immunities ; at his coronation he freely took the usual oaths of the Anglo-Saxon kings \u00a9 \u00a9 to govern according to the national laws; and he endeavoured by the vigilance and impartiality of his administration to protect the rights and to win the affections of all classes of his new subjects.* Life, property, and female honour were safer under his vigorous sway than they had been under England's native kings. In his own person he granted a ready access to every petitioner; and if we may believe one contemporary historian, he even made some efforts, though \u25a0 \u00a9 from his time of life ineffectually, to learn the English language, in order that he might the better administer justice by under standing every man's complaint in his own tongue .f policy of these measures was shortly proved. Selfish dissensions, distrust, and fear were paralyzing the Saxon counsels; the Earls Morcar and Edwin, as faithless to Edgar as they had already been to Harold, set a fatal example of desertion by retiring from the capital, leaving the boy king to his fate; and Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, then repairing to the Norman quarters, made a merit of being the first to tender his submission to the Conqueror. William was crossing the Thames at Wallingford o \u00a9 when he was joined by the primate; and on his arrival at Berkhampstead he was met by the Atheling Edgar himself, Edwin, Morcar, and others of the Saxon nobility and pre lates, and citizens of London, with an offer of the English crown.* The Conqueror was satisfied to receive, by the apparent gift of the nation, the king dom which he had partially won by the sword. He accepted the proffered allegiance of the English, took hostages from them as pledges of their fidelity, and appointed the approach ing festival of Christmas for his coronation. On the following morning William began his march towards London; but in spite of the agreement which had just been made, his troops plundered and laid waste the country and murdered the inhabitants as before. On approaching St. Albans the Normans found their progress stopped by a great number of felled trees which barri caded the road. The Conqueror immedi ately summoned Frithric, or Frederick, the abbot of St. Albans, to his presence, and demanded the meaning of these obstructions to his march. The abbot, who had royal Danish as well as noble Saxon blood in his veins, answered boldly, \" I have done the duty appertaining to my birth and calling, and if others of my rank and profession had performed the like, as they well could and ought, it had not been in thy power to penetrate into the land thus far.\" Sending on a part of his army to erect a fortress on the site now occupied by the Tower of But however sincere were these good intentions, they were soon frustrated by the inevitable consequences of his position be tween a victorious army and a subjugated population.

Even during the ceremony of his coronation in Westminster Abbey, the Norman troops stationed without pretended to mistake the acclamations of the English in the church for treasonable clamours, and immediately began to plunder and fire the adjacent houses : the natives, on their part, suspected a concerted design of pillage and massacre.* The king with difficulty appeased the tumult; and this ominous occurrence was only the forerunner of other disorders which increased the mutual animosity and mistrust of the two races. Meanwhile his progress in sub duing the country was but slow. He had not yet advanced in the north-east beyond the borders of Norfolk, nor in the south-east beyond Dorsetshire, while in the midland counties he had not succeeded in advancing as far as Oxford. He took care, however, to secure the territory which he had gained by the erection of strong castles and towers, which overawed the native population. He erected several additional fortresses around the capital; and as Winchester, which had been a favourite residence of the Anglo- Saxon kings, was, in the words of WUliain of Poictiers, the Conqueror's chaplain, \" a noble and powerful city, inhabited by a race of men, rich, fearless, and perfidious,\" a castle was erected there and garrisoned by a numerous body of troops. These measures w\u00a3re exceedingly distasteful to the English people ; and their dissatisfaction was greatly increased by the rapacity of the Norman priests and monks who had followed in the train of the Conqueror, which was scarcely inferior to that of the barons and knights who had fought at Hastings. William instituted many regulations to restrain the excesses of his foreign army; but even his presence and vigour were not always suffi cient to curb the want of discipline in fol lowers whose past claims he found it difficult to repay, and whose future services, either by disgusting or dismissing them, he could not safely afford to lose. But when, early in the spring after his accession, he paid a visit to his continental duchy, the oppression of the Norman officers and garrisons which he had stationed in the principal towns increased in his absence beyond all bounds, and maddened the people into a general insurrection. Odo, the half brother of the Conqueror, to whom he had confided the government during his absence on the Con tinent, instead of protecting the people from the tyranny of the invaders, aggravated their sufferings by his oppressive measures. Several popular risings took place in various parts of the country; but the insurgents were desti tute of any leaders of ability or hereditary influence, for the king had been careful to lead the principal English nobility in his train to Normandy, and therefore their movements wanted skilful concert and com bination.* The men of Kent were the first to attempt to throw off the galling yoke, and, headed by Eustace, count of Boulogne, a famous soldier, who had a personal quarrel with William, they took the field in great force. But being repulsed in a rash and premature attempt which they made on the strong castle of Dover, the count fled to his ship, and the native insurgents at once dispersed. A more formidable insurrection broke out in the west under a powerful Saxon thane named Edric the Forester; and the sons of Harold, who had fled to Ireland after the battle of Hastings, sailed up the Bristol Channel with sixty ships, and began to plunder the country, but were attacked and driven off by the people. In the midland counties also large bodies of English rose in arms and overpowered their Norman oppressors ; and if there had been any chief possessed of Harold's ability and popu larity to lead them, the English might have cleared the country of its invaders. But no such leader appeared, and hence the patriotic courage of the people spent itself in desul tory local efforts, which in the end served \u2022 Guil. Pict p. 145. Orderic. Vital p. 503 Flor.

He invited a consider able number of the Saxon chiefs to take part in the festival of Christmas, which he celebrated at London with unusual splen dour, and welcomed his guests with smiles and caresses. And he caused a proclamation to be read in all the churches of the capital declaring it to be his will that \" all the citi zens of London should enjoy their national laws as in the days of King Edward ; that every son should inherit from his father after the days of his father; and that none of his people should do them wrong.\" only to rivet the yoke more firmly on their necks. Meanwhile William was dazzling the eyes of his Norman subjects with the display of the immense and valuable booty which he had won by his sword. A part of his plunder he sent to the pope along with the banner of Harold. Another portion, consisting of gold coined and in bars, and of golden vases and richly embroidered stuffs, was distributed among the abbeys, monasteries, and churches of his native duchy, \" neither monks nor priests remaining without a guerdon.\" Wherever he went with his magnificent court there was a general holiday, and his subjects welcomed him with joyous enthu siasm. After spending eight months in a round of feasts and splendid celebrations, apparently undisturbed by the tidings which reached him from time to time of discontent and insurrections among his new subjects, William at length embarked at Dieppe on the 6th of December, 1067, and returned to England that night. The first measure by which the Conqueror evinced his altered policy was the imposition of an onerous tax upon the English, which he made more and more burdensome as his power increased. He then, early in the year 1068, entered upon a campaign in the west of England for the purpose of subjugat ing completely the inhabitants of Glouces tershire, Somersetshire, and Devonshire, who had refused to acknowledge his government. Githa or Editha, the mother of Harold, had fled into Devonshire after the battle of Hastings, carrying with her considerable riches. Along with some other relations of the late king she had taken refuge in Exeter, which was at that time a strong as well as populous city, and by her presence animated the citizens, who hated the very name of Norman, to offer a strenuous resist ance to the invader. After a siege which lasted eighteen days, and cost William a great number of men, the city was compelled to surrender, but on much more favourable terms than were then usual. The aged \u00a9 Githa, however, and other ladies of rank, succeeded in making their escape into Flanders. On reaching London, William learned the full extent of the dissatisfaction which existed with his government; and he seems from this time to have completely changed the character of his administration, which had hitherto been temperate and forbearing, and to have entertained the notion that it was impossible to govern his newly-acquired dominions except by the strong hand. As he was a man who stuck at no injustice or oppression which was needed to carry out his purpose, he entered without hesitation on a career which gradually led to the estab lishment of one of the most tremendous tyrannies on record, and brought into full play all the darker features of his own character. Exasperated at the rebellion of a people whose attachment he had vainly striven to gain by kindness, and stimulated by the interested representations of his Nor man chieftains, he indulged the dictates of a temper naturally harsh and suspicious, and sternly resolved henceforth to bend or break the spirit of the subjugated nation under a yoke of iron. He did not for some time, Having thus established his authority in Devonshire, the Conqueror turned his arms against the insurgents in Somerset and Glou cester, and made himself master of Oxford and other fortified places, which he had left"], [149, "a.d. 1068.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 111 in his rear when he inarched into the west. Wherever he succeeded in rendering his authority paramount, he immediately divided the land among his barons, and erected strong fortresses, garrisoned by Normans and other foreigners, for the purpose of bridling the native population. \" He took away,\" says Holinshed, \" from divers of the nobility and others of the better sort all their livings, and gave the same to his Normans. More over, he raised great taxes and subsidies through the realm; nor anything regarded the English nobility, so that they who before thought themselves to be made for ever by bringing a stranger into the realm, did now see themselves trodden under foot to be despised and to be mocked on all sides, insomuch that many of them were con strained (as it were for a further testimony of servitude and bondage) to shave their beards, to round their hair, and to frame themselves, as weU in apparel as in service and diet at their tables, after the Norman manner, very strange and far differing from the ancient customs and old usages of their country. Others, utterly refusing to sustain such an intolerable yoke of thraldom as was daily laid upon them by the Normans, chose rather to leave all, both goods and lands, and after the manner of outlaws got them to the woods with their wives, children, and servants, meaning from thenceforth to live upon the spoil of the country adjoining, and to take whatsoever came next to hand. Whereupon it came to pass within a while that no man might travel in safety from his own house or town to his next neighbour's ; and every quiet and honest man's house became as it were a hold and fortress fur nished for defence with bows and arrows, bills, poleaxes, swords, clubs and staves, and other weapons, the doors being kept locked and strongly bolted in the night season, as it had been in time of open war and amongst public enemies. Prayers were said also by the master of the house as though they had been in the midst of the seas in some stormy tempest; and when the windows or doors should be shut in and closed they used to say Benedkite, and others to answer Dominiis, in like manner as the priest and his penitent were wont to do at confession in the church.\" The severity of this despotism was felt by the Saxon thanes as well as by the mass of the people, and the one no less than the other were treated with injustice and insult. Edwin, earl of Mercia, brother-in-law of Harold, had by his early acknowledgment of the Conqueror's authority rendered im portant services to his cause, and William had promised to reward his submission with the hand of his daughter; but now, when the earl claimed the fulfilment of this engage ment, William not only refused his request but openly insulted him. This powerful noble and his brother Morcar immediately resented the injury by quitting the court and exciting a revolt among their northern countrymen. But the king, anticipating their design, marched against them with the utmost celerity, while they were still unpre pared for resistance. Advancing from Oxford he captured Warwick and Leicester at a blow. Then crossing the Trent, which he now saw for the first time, he took Derby, Notting ham, and Lincoln in rapid succession, and pressing onward came up with the forces of the northern carls drawn up near the junc tion of the Ouse with the Humber. A fierce conflict immediately ensued, in which the English were defeated with great slaughter. The fugitives took refuge in York, but the victors following rapidly on their track, broke into the city and massacred the inhab itants without respect of age or sex. A remnant of the patriotic army fled to the Scottish border, and found a place of safety in that wild district. William seized the occasion of this rebel lion to erect strong castles, which he gar risoned with his Norman followers, in all the principal towns of Mercia and Northumbria. He no longer cared to restrain the excesses \u00a9 of his foreign retainers; and from this period the English, finding themselves delivered over to the insolence and oppression of their tyrants, were provoked to repeated revolts, which being undertaken without concert,"], [150, "112 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1069. and quelled in succession with great blood shed, served only to rivet their chains, and to complete their misery. The whole body of the Saxon nobility was goaded by con tinued and galling injuries to participate in these popular revolts, and then by disgrace and confiscations systematically devoted to ruin. Many of them, and in the number Edgar Atheling, retired to Scotland, and found refuge at the court of Malcolm. The mother of the young prince and his two sisters, Margaret and Christina, accompanied him in his flight. The elder of these two princesses, Margaret, a lady of singular beauty and accomplishments, became the wife of the Scottish king, and exercised a most important influence on his character and government. At this juncture a con siderable number of the Norman knights who had followed the Conqueror from the Continent, wearied with this desultory and destructive massacre, of which there seemed to be no end, insisted on retiring from the service, to the grievous annoyance of the king. All his lavish promises of additional lands and honours failed to shake their reso lution, and William was so indignant at their desertion of him in this hour of need, that he immediately confiscated all the possessions he had conferred on them in England. The loss which he thus suffered, however, was speedily repaired by the acces sion of a large body of fresh adventurers and soldiers of fortune, who flocked to his stand ard from nearly every country in Europe. the foundations of a second castle, which the garrison completed upon his departure, though not without frequent interruptions by the natives. Having thus, as they ima gined, rendered this advanced post impreg nable, the Normans resolved to assume the offensive, and a body of about twelve hun dred men-at-arms under Robert de Comine, to whom William had granted vast posses sions in Northumbria, crossed the Tees and advanced as far as Durham. Taking up their quarters in this \" stronghold of the rebels of the North,\" as the Normans termed it, the invaders began to plunder the houses of the citizens, but great numbers of the inhabitants of the neighbouring district col lected during the night, and at break of day attacked the Normans on all sides. Buried as they were in slumber, induced by fatigue or debauchery, they fell an easy prey to their enemies. The bishop's house, in which Robert de Comine had taken up his quar ters, was burned to the ground, and all the Normans who were in it; and of all the men engaged in the expedition only two escaped. The fierce and warlike Northumbrians were chiefly of Danish blood, and had always maintained an intercourse with their an cestral country. They now made urgent applications for assistance to Sweno, king of Denmark, who at this juncture despatched an immense armament of two hundred and forty sail to co-operate with the Northum brians, and with Malcolm Canmore, king of Scotland, to whom they had also applied for aid. The expedition was placed under the supreme command of Sweno's brother Osbeorn, who was accompanied by Harold and Canute, the two sons of the king, and by four Danish chiefs of high renown. Sail ing up the estuary of the Humber, they landed at the point of its junction with the Ouse, about the middle of August, 1069. Here they were joined by Edgar Atheling, with Maelswine, Cospatric, Waltheof, and other powerful English nobles, who had hastened from the Scottish borders on hear ing of the arrival of the Danish armament, as well as by large bodies of the Anglo- The strong citadel which the Conqueror had erected at York was regarded as the bulwark of his dominions towards the north, and was held by a numerous and chosen garrison, who plundered and laid waste the surrounding country at their pleasure. The native English, provoked beyond measure at the barbarities inflicted on them, lay con stantly in ambush in the woods around, cut off considerable numbers of these marauders, and at length ventured to besiege the castle itself.

They determined to commence operations with an assault on the Norman fortresses at York. The garrison made a desperate resistance; but on the eighth day of the siege, having set fire to some houses near the castle for the purpose of hinder ing the operations of the besiegers, the flames, aided by a strong wind, spread in all directions, consumed the cathedral and a great part of the city, and ultimately reached the citadels in which the Normans had shut themselves up. To escape destruction by the fire which they had kindled, they made a sally, and attempted to cut their way through the host of assailants, but were slain almost to a man. William Malet, the governor, with his wife and children, Guil bert of Ghent, and a few other men of rank, alone were saved for the sake of their ransom. persed among the morasses and mountains. To complete the good fortune of William, his enemies about the same time met with a repulse in the south-west. The three sons of Harold having landed from Ireland on the coast of Devonshire, were surprised in a predatory descent near Plymouth, their fol lowers destroyed or dispersed, and themselves compelled to fly to their ships in such a state of destitution, that they finally with drew in despair to Denmark. These successes, however, had no effect in moderating the vindictive rage of the Conqueror. He was determined to keep at all hazards the crown which his sword had won, and he shrunk from no amount of injustice, oppression, or cruelty which he considered necessary to accomplish this end. He therefore without scruple trampled under foot the ancient laws of the kingdom, wrested its lands from their lawful owners, and divided them among aliens in blood and language, and mercilessly exterminated the inhabitants of those provinces which refused to submit to his sway. His triumph at York was followed up by an act of cold blooded vengeance which should cover his memory with eternal infamy. As the northern provinces had been the repeated scene of most obstinate resistance to his authority, he thought it good policy to carry into effect the diabolical vow which he had made in the forest of Dean, to strike terror generally through that part of Eng land, and to protect his garrison at York from further incursions by utterly destroy ing the whole country from the Ouse to the Tyne with fire and sword. Throughout an extent of sixty miles the houses and provisions were burned, the inhabitants slaughtered, or if they escaped pursuit, left to die by hunger and cold ; and so horribly complete was the work of desolation, that while no fewer than one hundred thousand persons are declared to have perished at the time, the whole fertile district from York to Durham remained for years a scathed and barren solitude. William of Malmsbury, who wrote about eighty years after, says, The news of this terrible catastrophe reached the Conqueror while he wras hunt ing in the forest of Dean, and he swore on the spot a solemn oath that he would utterly exterminate the people of Northumbria. Having dexterously conciliated the people in the southern districts of the kingdom, partly by redressing their grievances, partly by promises that he would govern them justly for the suture, he marched to the north at the head of a powerful and finely equipped army. The English rose against him on all sides, and sought to retard his advance by incessant attacks on his rear as \u2022HB_11 as in front; but he steadily pressed onward till he reached York, the stronghold of the insurrection. He had previously opened secret negotiations with Osbeorn, the brother of King Sweno, and by means of gold and presents had induced the Danish leader to withdraw his army and fleet. The defenders of York, though thus abandoned in their utmost need by their perfidious allies, made an obstinate resistance, but were in the end overpowered with great slaughter. Edgar Atheling made his escape into Scot land, and was shortly after followed by a number of the English nobles, while their followers, disheartened and disorganized, dis- 15"], [152, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1070-1073. 114 \" From York to Durham not an inhabited village remained. Fire, slaughter, and desolation made a vast wilderness there which continues to this day.\" All the chroniclers and historians, indeed, Norman, French, and English, join in condemning and deploring this barbarous and shocking burst of vengeance, which seems to have been regarded by the men of that day with horror and astonishment. \" It was a horrid spectacle,\" says Roger Hoveden, \" to see on the high roads and public places and at the doors of houses, human bodies eaten by the worms, for there remained no one to cover them with a little earth.\" Famine and pestilence followed in the wake of the devastating army, and carried off most of those who had escaped the sword, so that \" the cities were wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land made desolate with desolation.\" belonging to the sacred houses were in many cases carried off by the rapacious spoilers. The sections of the newly conquered terri tory which were allotted to the leading barons in the train of the Conqueror were immense. William de Warenne had twenty eight villages in Yorkshire alone, and more than eighty manors were assigned to William de Percy. Most of these domains are de scribed in Domesday Book, drawn up fifteen years later, as \" waste land.\" Vast tracts of land to the north of York fell to the lot of Allan the Breton, who erected a strong castle on a hill nearly surrounded by the river Swale, \" which,\" says an old chronicler, \" was designed to protect him and his men from the attacks of the disinherited English.\" This fortress he called Rkhemont, the origin of the town of Richmond. The island of Holderness fell to the share of Dreux Bruere, a captain of Flemish auxiliaries, and the husband of one of William's relations, whom he afterwards killed in a fit of passion, but escaped merited punishment by an artful stratagem, and found refuge on the Conti nent. The vast domain of Pontefract was allotted to the celebrated Gilbert de Lacy, the founder of Pontefract castle, who was the first to carry the Norman arms into Lancashire and Cheshire, where he obtained estates still more extensive. Robert de Bruce, the ancestor of the vindicator of Scottish independence, received several hun dred manors and the dues of Hartlepool, the port of Durham. Ivo de Vesci obtained possession of the town of Alnwick, and great estates by marriage with the grand daughter of an English noble who had fallen at Hastings \u2014 an example of a process by which many extensive landed possessions were transferred from native to foreign \u00a9 owners.* A number of the patriot chiefs themselves, despairing of their cause, made their peace with the Conqueror and obtained a share of the honours and rewards which he was distributing with lavish hand. The Mercian earls, Morcar and Edwin, submitted to William for the second time, and were William himself in his destructive raid did not advance beyond Hexham, but re turned to York by an indirect and almost impassable route across the mountains, covered with snow, in which his men suf fered dreadful privations and most of his horses perished. He left the task of con quering the rest of Northumbria, including the mountainous district of Cumberland and the moors and marshes of Westmoreland, to be completed by his barons and knights, who carried out the work of vengeance with hearty goodwill. Confiscation now became almost general, and the territory on both sides of the Humber, devastated as it lay, was partitioned out among the chief captains of the Conqueror, so that in the north, as had previously been the case in the south, the largest estates were gradually transferred to foreigners; native Englishmen were in the end almost entirely excluded from the highest class of landowners, and became an inferior class on their own soil. The mov able property deposited for safety in the monasteries was also seized by William, under the pretext that it had belonged to disloyal and rebellious subjects; and even the gold and silver vessels and ornaments * Thierry, vol. i. pp. 227-230."], [153, "a.d. 1070-1073.1 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 115 restored to their paternal estates. Cospatric, who came in along with them, was intrusted with the government of Northumberland; and Waltheof, another powerful English noble, the brave son of Siward, immortalized by Shakspeare, was made earl of Hunting don and Northampton, and received the hand of Judith, one of the nieces of the king, an artful and abandoned woman, who was subsequently the cause of his ruin. dence in the Tower of London or in West minster Abbey. The fierce and warlike inhabitants of North Wales and Cheshire so harassed Gherband that, wearied by the incessant fatigues and dangers of his post, he resigned his command and returned to his own country. The earldom of Chester was then conferred on Hugh d'Avranches, a ferocious soldier, surnamed \"the Wolf.\" He and his lieutenants invaded North Wales and conquered a part of Flintshire. Roused to even more than their usual ferocity by the obstinate resistance of the natives, they shed blood like water, and spared neither sex nor age. The conquered territory was portioned out among the friends and vassals of \" the Wolf\" on the usual condition of feudal service and fealty to their superior; and important privileges, rights of jurisdiction and revenue, were attached to the various offices conferred upon them. Meanwhile the north-western districts were in a very insecure state, and William hastened thither soon after his return from Hexham to York. The roads across the mountains which run down the centre of the country were almost impassable, and the difficulties of the march were greatly aggra- vated by the inclemency of the weather. The soldiers, impeded by storms of sleet and snow, and disheartened by prospective as well as actual hardships and dangers, murmured loudly at the call made upon them for new exertions; and they were further discouraged by reports respecting the rugged and mountainous nature of the country bordering on the western sea, and the determined ferocity of the inhabitants. But the indomitable energy of William overcame every obstacle. Partly by liberal promises, partly by an affected indifference, he induced his soldiers to follow him in his laborious and perilous march from York to Chester, the only important city in England which had not yet been invaded by the Normans. No resistance, however, was attempted there, and the Conqueror having entered the city in triumph, according to his custom erected a fortress there, and con- ferred the command on a Fleming named Gherband, the first person who bore the title of earl of Chester. During William's residence here the patriotic chief, Edric the Forester, submitted to his authority and was received into favour. Strong fortresses were soon after erected at Salisbury and at Stafford. The royal castle at Winchester, the strongest in England, was the spring palace of the Conqueror, that of Gloucester was his winter palace, while in summer he took up his resi- The whole of England was now overrun, if not actually conquered, by the foreign invaders, and there was no longer any body of men under arms capable of resisting the forces of the Conqueror. Numbers of the English thanes left the country, as an old chronicler expresses it, to carry their grief and misery through foreign lands. Of those who could not or would not emigrate, many sought refuge in the vast forests which covered many districts of the country, whence they sallied out on their oppressors, putting some to death, exacting a ransom from others, and keeping the Normans and those English who had made peace with them in a state of constant alarm. The most numerous and formidable of these bands of patriotic refugees had taken up their residence in the fen country of Lin colnshire, Huntingdon, and Cambridge. In this district there was a vast extent of low and marshy land, intersected in every direc tion by sluggish streams, and quite imprac ticable for cavalry and heavily armed soldiers. Here the patriots constructed what was called \" a camp of refuge,\" to which Englishmen of all classes, thanes despoiled of their lands,"], [154, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1070-1073. 116 every inlet from the sea to the fens, while his army blocked up all access by land. He then commenced, on the western side, the construction of a wooden causeway across the morasses, which was to be three thousand paces long. But the work was so often interrupted by the sudden, mysterious, and destructive attacks of Hereward, that the terrified workmen and soldiers attributed his successes to the aid of Satan, and William himself was driven to employ a sorceress to defeat the spells of the English. For this purpose she was stationed with great cere mony in a wooden tower at the head of the works in progress; but at this critical moment the redoubtable Hereward sallied out from his fastness and set fire to the dry reeds and rushes. The flames, spread rapidly by the wind, soon reached the wooden tower, and consumed the ill-fated magician and most of the soldiers and work men who were with her. bishops expelled from their sees, abbots driven from their monasteries, and great numbers of the common people, repaired from time to time. The two Mercian earls, Edwin and Morcar, having received timely notice that William intended to seize them, concealed themselves till the vigilance of their enemies was abated. Edwin then attempted to make his escape into Scotland, but was betrayed by some of his followers, and was killed by a party of Normans; but his brother, more fortunate, made his way to the morasses of Cambridgeshire, where he obtained shelter in the Isle of Ely. The insurgents were further augmented by a considerable number of the English chiefs of the north, who had been driven into Scotland, but now returned to aid their countrymen in their final struggle against Norman tyranny. The principal leader, however, in this camp of refuge was the renowned Hereward, the Saxon lord of Bann, in Lincolnshire. He had emigrated to Flanders after the Conquest; but having heard that his father was dead, and that his paternal heritage had been seized by a Nor man who had insulted and ill-treated his mother, he returned to England, expelled the usurper, and took possession of his inheritance. Here, protected by the inac cessible situation of the place, he carried on with consummate skill and bravery a partisan warfare against the oppressors of his country men. The insurgents at length grew so formidable that William took the field against them in person, at the head of a powerful army. But he found it impossible to penetrate into the recesses of the fens, which were intersected in all directions by streams and broad meres with scarcely any roads, and these known only to the natives. His attacks were all repulsed, and consider able numbers of his men surprised and destroyed among the swamps and bogs covered by tall rushes. William soon saw that in order to success the camp of refuge must be invested by water as well as by land, and having collected a large number of flat-bottomed boats he sent them to watch But famine and treachery effected what military skill and courage had failed to do. After the blockade of the Isle of Ely had lasted several months, the inmates of a mon astery which was on the isle, unable to endure any longer the hunger and suffering inflicted by the siege, sent to the enemy's camp, offering to point out a passage across the fens if the king would secure them the possession of their property. The offer was readily accepted, and under the guidance of the monks the Normans penetrated sud denly into the island, and taking possession of the monastery, which formed part of the line of defence, killed a thousand of the English, and compelled the remainder to lay down their arms. Hereward, however, and a few of his followers forced their way, sword in hand, through the enemy, and gaining the fens in Lincolnshire carried on for a time a destructive guerilla warfare against the invaders. But seeing at length that the struggle was hopeless, he listened to the overtures made by the king, who seems to have admired the bravery and skill of this last champion of English independence, and having accepted the king's peace, as it was"], [155, "a.d. 1070-1073. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 117 termed, he was restored to the estates of his ancestors. The patriots who were captured in the Isle of Ely were not so fortunate. Some regained their liberty on the payment of large ransoms, some were put to death, some had their eyes put out, or their right hands and feet cut off, and were then dis persed throughout the country; and some, like Earl Morcar and bishops Eghelwin and Eghelric, were condemned to perpetual im prisonment. fellow-feeling with them. W hen we stretch out our hands towards their heroes, we scarcely embrace more than a shadow. But let us not distort history by throwing the unmerited reproach of want of national spirit on the Anglo-Saxons, and thus placing an impass able barrier between our sympathy and the founders of our laws and liberties, whose language we speak, in whose homes we dwell, and in whose establishments and institutions we justly glory.\" After the destruction of the last strong hold of the English patriots, William resolved to chastise Malcolm, king of Scotland, for the assistance he had repeatedly afforded them in their struggle for independence. Driving before him some bands of insurgents, who had again raised the standard of inde pendence on the border, and offered a fierce resistance to his progress, William for the first time crossed the Tweed at the head of a powerful army, and advanced as far as the Firth of Forth. The English emigrants, however, escaped his pursuit, and Malcolm refused to deliver them up; but intimidated by the presence of such a formidable force, the Scottish king, says an old chronicler, \" came and agreed with King William and delivered hostages and was his man, and the king went home with all his army.\" After his return from Scotland, William, having now at length fully established his authority in England, ventured upon another visit to his continental dominions, where his presence was required to suppress certain intestine disorders. Hubert, the last count of Maine, a province closely adjoining Normandy, had bequeathed his territories to William some years before the invasion of England ; but the people, strongly dissatisfied with the tyrannical administration of their new rulers, and instigated by Fulk, count of Anjou, the rival of William, had risen in rebellion and expelled both the Norman magistrates and soldiers. Having thus achieved their independence, the citizens of Mans formed themselves into an association termed a commune, for their mutual defence against oppression, and attacked the castles of the nobles who refused their adhesion to this league. William, with his usual sagacity and promptitude, availed himself of this con test between the feudal and the civic power and of the settlement of England, to invade and reduce Maine. But deeming it impolitic to withdraw his Norman soldiers from the island, he enlisted a considerable force, com posed mainly of English, and joining to them some troops levied in Normandy he marched into the province of Maine. The English, desirous to retrieve their national reputation for valour, and hating the Manceaux for the part they took in the conquest seven years before, inflicted great cruelties on the un fortunate people, burning their towns and villages, and laying waste their country. Terrified by these excesses the Manceaux hastened to make their peace with William, William had now been seven years en gaged in the reduction of the kingdom, and in the suppression of a series of local revolts, and the work was at length completed. \" The successive contests in which the Conqueror was engaged,\" says Sir James Mackintosh, \" ought not to be regarded as on his part measures to quell rebellion. They were a series of wars levied by a foreign prince against unconquered and unbending portions of the Saxon people. Their resistance was not a flame casually lighted up by the oppression of rulers ; it was the defensive warfare of a nation who took up arms to preserve, not to recover, their independence. There are few examples of a people who have suffered more for national dignity and legitimate freedom. The Britons are perhaps too far from us to admit our"], [156, "118 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1073-107.. and surrendered their fortresses to his captains. On their taking the oath of allegiance to him he promised them the preservation of their ancient franchises, and led back his army to England laden with booty. pursuits suited to his feeble capacity and irresolute character. While William lingered on the Continent a formidable insurrection broke out, not among the English, but among the Norman barons, who had become exceedingly dis satisfied with the imperious conduct and tyrannical policy of the king. On the violent death in Flanders of William Fitz- Osborn, the favourite counsellor of the Conqueror, his eldest son inherited his Nor man possessions, while Roger, the youngest, obtained his English estates, with the earl dom of Hereford. This young nobleman negotiated a marriage for his sister Emma with Ralph de Gael, a Breton by birth, who had become earl of Norfolk. For some unknown reason or caprice William thought fit to disapprove of the proposed alliance, and sent from Normandy an express order that it should not take place. This peremp tory prohibition gave deep offence to the parties in question, who resolved to pay no regard to it; and accordingly the affianced bride was married at Norwich on the day which had been fixed for the ceremony, and was attended by a great concourse of Norman barons and clergy, with a number of their Saxon friends, and even Welshmen, invited by the earl of Hereford, whose estates lay contiguous to the principality. During the marriage feast, which was celebrated with great splendour, and followed by copious libations of wine, the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, who knew that the king would not fail to inflict punishment upon them for carrying the forbidden marriage into effect, broke out into violent invectives against \u00a9 William, which were loudly applauded by the company. \" He is a bastard, a man of low birth,\" said the Normans; \" he may call himself a king, but it is clearly seen that he is not made for one, and that God hath him not in his grace.\" \" He poisoned our Conan, the brave earl of Brittany, for whom our country still mourns,\" cried the Bretons. \" He invaded the noble land of England,\" exclaimed the Saxons; \"he massacred the legitimate heirs or drove them into exile.\" These successes on the Continent, more than perhaps the conquest of England, at length excited the jealousy of Philip, king of France, and roused him from the strange indifference with which he had regarded the aggrandizement of his powerful vassal. He now resolved, by sen ling aid to the English, to stir up a new insurrection, which might find employment for William on this side of the Channel. With this view he invited Edgar Atheling, with whose weak and irresolute character he was probably unac quainted, to pay him a visit and aid him in his councils, and promised him the fortress of Montreuil, which was conveniently situated for conducting operations either against Normandy or England. Edgar eagerly accepted this proposal ; and having got ready a few ships with a small band of soldiers, he set sail for France. But his usual bad fortune attended him; his ships were dis persed and driven on shore by a violent storm; some were sunk, others dashed to pieces on the English coast and their crews made prisoners, while Edgar himself and a few of his principal attendants escaped and got back to Scotland in the most miserable plight. Broken down and completely dis heartened by this crowning disaster, Edgar, by the advice of his brother-in-law, Malcolm Canmore, sought a reconciliation with the Conqueror, who at once invited him to join him in Normandy, and promised him honourable treatment. Traversing England, attended by a numerous escort, and enter tained by the way at the castles of the Norman barons, he crossed the Channel and was received by the king with apparent cordiality. Apartments were assigned him in the royal palace at Rouen, with a liberal allowance for his support; and there the heir of the old Saxon monarchs passed eleven years of his life, occupying himself with"], [157, "a.d. 1073-1075.

The earl of Norfolk, deprived of the assist ance which he expected from his confederate, and from the king of Denmark, whose aid he had invoked, was attacked near Cam bridge, and completely routed by Odo, bishop of Bayeux, and Richard de Bienfait and William de Warenne, the justiciaries of the kingdom, at the head of a superior force. The prisoners taken in the battle were treated with great cruelty, and the right foot of each was cut off, of whatever rank or nation. Ralph de Gael escaped to his stronghold at Norwich, which he garrisoned with his most trusty followers ; and leaving the defence of the castle to his bride, he sailed to Brittany to seek assistance from his friends there. The young countess showed herself worthy of this trust, and defended the fortress with great bravery for some months, till compelled to capitulate by the pressure of famine. The lives of the garrison, however, mostly com posed of Bretons, were spared, on condition that they should quit England within forty days. The conspirators were anxious to obtain the approbation and assistance of the power- fid Earl Waltheof, who had married Judith, the niece of the Conqueror, and had received from him the government of Northumber- land when Cospatric was unfairly deprived of it. His skill in war, and his great popu- larity with his countrymen, made his co- operation peculiarly valuable ; and the earls of Hereford and Norfolk endeavoured to enlist him in their cause by appeals to his patriotism, his desire of vengeance, and his self-interest, offering him one of the three kingdoms into which they proposed to par- tition England. According to one version of the story, Waltheof, carried away by the ardour and enthusiasm around him, gave his assent to a scheme which held out the prospect of relief to his countrymen ; but next morning, \"when he had consulted with his pillow, and awakened his wits to perceive the danger whereunto he was drawn, he determined not to move in it.\" According to another and more generally received ac- count, the earl refused from the first to take any part in the conspiracy, and only took an oath not to reveal it to William or his friends. It is agreed en all sides that Waltheof did not take up arms, or commit any overt act that could be construed into treason; but unfortunately for himself he disclosed to his wife what had taken place, and this aban- doned woman betrayed him to his ruin. The conspirators were forced to take the field without due preparation, and before their schemes were matured. The earl of Here ford, who had hastened to his own territories, succeeded in levying a numerous body of The Primate Lanfranc, who acted as vice roy during the king's absence, and had displayed great activity in the suppression of the insurrection, launching his spiritual thunders at the conspirators, as well as vigor ously employing carnal weapons, had mean while written to William not to hurry himself in crossing the sea, for it would be putting to shame his officers to come and aid them in destroying such traitors and thieves. Accordingly, the king, before returning to England to enjoy the victory achieved in his absence, made a hostile incursion into Brittany, in the hope of seizing the fugitive baron on his native earth, and subduing the province, the constant aim of his predeces sors. But after unsuccessfully laying siege to the town of Dol, he was obliged to retreat * Thierry, vol. i. pp- 278-279 Order. Vitalis, p 534."], [158, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1075. 120 fore, though caressed, flattered, promoted, he was sacrificed without scruple on the first convenient pretext. The chroniclers indeed affirm that William had long enter tained the desire of getting rid of the last of the Saxon thanes, and eagerly availed himself of a pretext for sending him to the scaffold. Judith, the wife of Waltheof, had conceived a passion for a Norman noble, whom she hoped to marry if she were made a widow. She had, therefore, at the outset conveyed intelligence to the king of the conspiracy, as soon as it was revealed to her by her unsuspecting husband, and aggra vated every circumstance likely to prejudice her uncle's mind against him. At a later period she accused Waltheof of having invited over the Danish fleet, which at this juncture appeared on the English coast. Her charges were supported by the rapa cious courtiers of the king, who coveted the three earldoms possessed by the Saxon chief, \"his greatest possessions being his greatest enemies.\" After suffering imprisonment for nearly a year, sentence of death was pro nounced upon him, and he was executed (29th April, 1075) at Winchester at a very early hour in the morning, and with inde cent haste, lest the citizens should attempt a rescue. The people went into mourning for his death, honoured him with the name of martyr, and believed that miracles were wrought at his tomb in the abbey of Croy land, to which he had been a great bene factor. His widow, \" the infamous Judith,\" as the old chroniclers term her, soon after incurred the displeasure of her uncle, on account of her refusal to marry one Simon of Senlis in Normandy, a brave soldier, but lame and deformed, to whom William pro mised her hand and estates. She was, there fore, stripped of all her possessions, which were conferred upon Simon, and the wretched woman, abhorred by the English and des pised by the Normans, passed the remainder of her life in poverty, remorse, and misery, wandering in remote and secluded corners of England, seeking to hide her shame.* before the army of the duke of Brittany, supported by the French king, and to con clude a peace in which Ralph de Gael was included. William then crossed the sea to wreak his vengeance on the insurgents in England. The earl of Hereford was con demned to perpetual imprisonment and the forfeiture of his goods; the earl of Norfolk was outlawed; and great numbers of their adherents were hanged, blinded, or muti lated, and the city of Norwich was assailed with ruthless and indiscriminating revenge. His contemporaries did not fail to recognize the divine vengeance on the oppressor in the downfall of the house of William Fitz- Osborn, seneschal of Normandy and of England, the man who had most urgently persuaded William to undertake the invasion of England. An old chronicler of Norman race, though born in England, expressing the popular feeling on the subject, exclaims \u2014 \" Where is now this William Fitz-Os born? He who was the first and greatest oppressor of the English, who through ambi tion and avarice encouraged the fatal enter prise in which so many thousands of men perished; he fell in his turn and received his just reward. He who killed so many men with the sword died by the sword, and after his death the spirit of discord made his son and his son-in-law revolt against their lord and kinsman. The race of Wil liam Fitz-Osborn has been uprooted from England, so that now there is not a corner in which it can set foot.\"* The great English earl, Waltheof, was visited with much severer punishment than even the ringleaders in the conspiracy. He had at the utmost been guilty of only mis prision of treason. But though William \"could be merciful when mercy was not dangerous, he could shed innocent blood without remorse, if its shedding seemed to add safety to his throne.\" The repeated revolts of the imbecile Edgar Atheling were forgiven as often as they occurred ; but Waltheof was powerful, rich, and popular, and might become formidable, and there- * Order.

At his request the reigning pontiff, Alexander II., sent legates into England, who, taking ad vantage of the irregular means by which Archbishop Stigand had obtained the pallium from the antipope Benedict, deposed that prelate ; and the king immediately promoted Lanfranc, a Milanese monk, to the vacant primacy. Upon less plausible pretexts many of the other English prelates were next deprived of their sees, which were given to Normans; nor were these violent ejec tions confined to the episcopal order, so that in a few years not only every bishop, but every considerable abbot of English birth, had been replaced by some foreigner.* But though William had made the papal authority thus subservient to his policy, he was not himself the more disposed to sub mit to its encroachments. While he allowed fealty to thee and thy successors: I have admitted the first of these demands; as to the second, I neither have nor will admit it. I will not swear fealty to thee, because I have not promised it, and because none of my predecessors have sworn fealty to thine.* This exclusion of the native English from all dignities, ecclesiastical as well as civil and military, completed the signal revolution which had only commenced with the victory of Hastings. The spectacle which it affords in the thorough subjugation of a great kingdom and a brave and numerous people by a foreign and detested enemy, whose strength probably never exceeded its original array of sixty thousand men, is in itself so extraordinary, as to have attracted the wonder and engaged the frequent in quiry of historians. But the catastrophe, notwithstanding the disproportion of numeri cal force, is explained by the relative position and qualities of the victors and the van quished. While the Norman conquerors had the advantages of union and discipline, under a single leader of indefatigable activity and consummate talents, the nation which they subdued was destitute of any of these means of organized defence. The English had never been an united people; and at no period in the Anglo-Saxon, or rather Anglo-Danish annals, had the natives of the northern, eastern, and southern provinces of the kingdom \u2014 a fact which has seldom been sufficiently considered \u2014 acquired a complete amalgamation of political and social feelings. Again, the frequent inter ruption in the legitimate succession of the royal Saxon family, by the Danish conquest and the usurpation of Harold, had chilled all sentiments of hereditary attachment in the people to the line of their native sovereigns; and the youth and imbecile character of the last male heir of the house of Cerdic, although that prince was not deficient in personal courage, disqualified him for rekindling the popular loyalty, and rousing the national spirit in a common cause. Thus it was that, after the fall of Harold, the English the pope's legates to minister to his own tyranny, he prohibited his prelates from obedience to any papal decrees until ratified by himself;! and the energy of his char- acter, as well as the respect which it inspired, was never more conspicuous than in the subjection in which he continued to hold the English church, even after the accession of Gregory VII. to the tiara, when the pre- tensions of the papacy had been raised to their highest pitch by the bold and ambitious spirit of that celebrated pontiff. In the year 1087 Gregory wrote the Conqueror a letter, complaining of the delay which had taken place in the payment of the Peter's pence stipulated in the treaty of alliance concluded at Rome in 1066, and requiring him to do homage to the see of Rome for the kingdom of England, and to acknowledge himself the vassal of the church. To these demands William answered firmly, \" Thy legate has required me on thy part to send money to the Roman church, and to swear * Hoveden, p. 453. Malmsbury, De Gest.

Their struggles for the national independence were therefore commenced without real union among themselves, and supported without hearty confidence by the people. To these general causes for the failure of every revolt are added, by a contemporary historian,* the defenceless condition of the English towns \u2014 for almost the only places of strength in the kingdom were the castles erected and garrisoned by the Norman lords and their retainers \u2014 and the consequent want of fortresses, as well as leaders, to sustain the desultory operations of the insurgents. Englishman became, for above a century, a term of contempt and opprobrium .* While the common mass of the nation groaned under this bondage, some more generous spirits indignantly preferred exile to slavery ; and a body of nobles and their followers, sailing to the Mediterranean, found their way to the court of Constantinople, and entered the service of the Eastern emperor. In the wars of Alexius with the Normans of Italy these English exiles displayed their valour and revenge against the kindred race of their oppressors. United with some Danish adventurers under the common title of Varangians, their descendants, preserving the Saxon name and language for a hundred and fifty years, proved the bravest and most faithful guards of the Byzantine throne until the fall of Constantinople before the French and Venetian crusaders, f Other Saxons of rank sought a refuge in Scotland ; and being protected and gifted with estates by its sovereign, became the sounders of many of the most distinguished families among the southern or lowland nobility of that kingdom. J Altogether, therefore, it may cease to excite our surprise that the English, not withstanding the native valour of their race, were everywhere worsted in the struggle with their Norman oppressors, and that, after a few years of unavailing resistance, they yielded to their fate in sullen, hopeless despair. All their nobility had either perished in the conflict, or been reduced to ruin by the loss of their dignities and the confiscation of their estates. Nearly the whole soil of the kingdom, with the exclusive possession of all political power, had passed into the hands of foreigners; and the few native proprietors who were allowed to retain their lands held them only as sub-vassals to the Norman feuda tories of William. From the tyranny of those chieftains and their insolent retainers the people were exposed to every species of rapine and indignity ; and by the intro duction of the Norman tongue into all legal proceedings their language itself seemed proscribed. Whatever was Saxon in line age, speech, or manners, was in Norman estimation synonymous with degradation and barbarism ; and the very name of an The measures by which William cemented the fabric of his despotism display him in the light of a crafty and far-sighted states man, as well as a vigorous conqueror. While he rewarded his followers by gradually par celling among them the lands of the Saxon nobles, and investing his chief officers with hereditary governments in the shape of earldoms, he in general effectually pre vented any of them from becoming too powerful by distributing their estates over various parts of the kingdom. The further subdivision of their lands among their own retainers, in exchange for military service, was a necessary consequence ; and the com plete introduction of the feudal system into England was the natural result of the posi tion in which the conquerors were placed. But while William was obviously led to * Ingulf, pp. 61-71, &c. Orderic. Vital, pp. 521-523, &c. Eadmer, p. 110. t Du Cange, Not. ad Alexiad. pp 256-258. Idem, sur Villehardouin, pp. 296-298.

He is believed to have divided the whole king dom into about sixty thousand knights' fees, from each of which the service of a mounted soldier was due to the sovereign, as well as to the baron under whom the sub-fief was held. * By this means he could at all times call a numerous army into the field ; nor did he trust only to such feudal levies, for he besides kept large bodies of mercenary troops in his pay. f These he was enabled to maintain by the extortions with which he swelled his revenues. The demesne lands of the crown, increased by confisca tions to nearly fifteen hundred manors, all which he retained for his own profit, and farmed out to the highest bidders, yielded him a great income, f The feudal incidents which he rigorously levied from his great vassals and their tenants, formed also a con tinual source of revenue. Tallages, or aids in another form, with tolls and customs, were heavily exacted from the inhabitants of all cities, burghs, and sea-ports ; and the whole rural English population was griev ously taxed by the revival of the ancient imposition of the Danegelt, which we have seen that the Confessor had abolished. From the arrfrregate of these extortions, the king is DO \u00a9 ' o declared by a contemporary authority \u00a7 to have obtained sums so enormous for the times as to appear almost incredible ; and being also a great economist, he became the wealthiest prince in Europe. English, in the payment of these extor tionate dues to the crown, gave rise to one memorable work of statistical labour. This was the compilation of that curious and celebrated record known under the name of Domesday Book. By the royal com mand, commissioners were employed to make an exact survey of all the lands in the kingdom: their divisions and value; the nature and obligation of the tenures under which they were held; the amount of assessment for the Danegelt to which they were liable; the names of their pro prietors; and the number and condition of all the inhabitants, both free and servile, of the towns and country. The information thus obtained by the official labour of six years was collected into two volumes, which, under the expressive title of the Book of Judgment, were deposited in the royal exchequer; and this great work, though its object renders it less honourable to the genius of the Conqueror than some writers have imagined, is the most precious monument illustrative of the ancient con dition of the kingdom which has been preserved to our times.* To complete the picture of William's despotism, one act remains to be recorded, which its very wantonness rendered far more inexcusable than the severest or most rapacious measures dictated by his policy. The love of the chase was, next to ambition and avarice, his strongest passion; and to gratify this he was not contented with the possession of the numerous royal forests already reserved by the Saxon sovereigns for their amusement in different parts of the kingdom, but resolved to create a new wilderness in the vicinity of Winchester, his usual residence. He therefore caused a tract of the richest and most populous country in Hampshire, measuring thirty miles from Salisbury to the sea, and in circumference about ninety miles, to be laid waste for the protection of game. The inhabitants were cruelly expelled with- The rapacious anxiety of William to frustrate all attempts at evasion, as well by his Norman vassals as the subjugated \u2022 Orderic. Vital, p. 523.

When the Con queror had seated himself on the throne of England, Robert, who had meanwhile grown up to maturity, claimed from his father the fulfilment of his promise. But the Conqueror was determined to retain both his old and his new possessions, and returned the homely but decisive answer, \"My son, I wot not to throw off my clothes till I go to bed.\" A violent quarrel ensued between father and son, which was greatly aggravated by the interference of William Rufus and Henry, the younger sons of William, who seemed to be the objects of his special favour. It was a frolic or insult put upon Robert by his brothers which produced the first open breach in the family. One day when the king and his sons were residing in the little town of L'Aigle, William and Henry went to the lodgings of Robert, and ascending to the upper rooms, began to play at dice, and after making a great noise and up roar, they ended their boyish pranks by emptying a pitcher of water upon Robert and his friends, who were in the courtyard below. Robert, who was naturally of a fiery temper, rushed up stairs with his drawn sword, to avenge the affront; a great tumult ensued, and the king with difficulty saved his younger sons from the fury of their offended brother. The latter on the following night withdrew from the court with his comrades, and hastened to Rouen, in order to surprise the castle. He was unsuccessful, however, in this attempt; and some of his warmest supporters having soon after been captured by the royal officers, he fled across the frontier of Normandy, and took refuge in La Perche.* A reconcilia tion afterwards took place between the king and his son through the mediation of the queen, but it did not last long, for his com panions worked on his feelings by invidious reflections on his father's great wealth and his poverty, which left him without a penny out compensation; one hundred and eight places \u2014 manors, hamlets, and villages \u2014 with several monasteries and no fewer than thirty-six parish churches were destroyed, and the whole tract was abandoned to herds of deer and other wild animals.* The name of the New Forest which, at the distance of seven centuries, the same dis trict still retains, marks the scene of this atrocious caprice of his tyranny; and the sanguinary laws by which he guarded his pleasures are no less execrable memorials of his inhumanity. By these, in an age in which even the crime of murder might be commuted by a pecuniary fine, the man who killed a hart or a wild boar on the royal demesnes was punished with the loss of his eyes. The blood of his subjects, indeed, was considered of less value in his mind than the lives of these animals: for \"so much he loved the high deer,\" says the simple language of the Saxon Chronicle, \"as if he had been their father. \"f The importance of that great revolution which was effected by the Norman con quest has demanded a detailed narration of the measures of the Conqueror: the re maining transactions of his reign may be more briefly dismissed. So effectually had the spirit of his British subjects been broken by the despotic force of his government, that, after the submission of the brave Hereward, the tranquillity of the kingdom was undisturbed even by a single tumult of the native population. And though the arbitrary character of his administration caused some of his own Norman followers to rise in open rebellion, the royal authority, as we have seen, was too firmly established to be shaken even by the efforts of these powerful malcontents. Robert Courthouse, the eldest of his three sons, had before the invasion of England been named by William heir to his title and estates; and probably with a view to allay the jealousy of the king of France and his other neighbours, he had promised * Malmsbury, p 111.

Ask him for a por tion of his England, or at least for the duchy of Normandy, which he promised thee before all his barons.\" Stimulated by such sug gestions as these, Robert renewed his former demand; but the king once more returned a peremptory refusal, and at the same time exhorted his son to make choice of wise and grave men for his counsellors, like Arch bishop Lanfranc. \" Sire,\" replied Robert sharply, \" I came here to claim my right, and not to listen to sermons. I have heard plenty of them, and wearisome enough they were, when I was at my grammar. Answer me, therefore, distinctly, so that I may know what I have to do, for I am firmly resolved not to live on the bread of others, and not to receive the wages of any man.\" William replied, with great heat, that he was deter mined never to relinquish Normandy, the place of his birth, nor to share with another England, which he had acquired at the cost of so much toil and peril. \" Well, then,\" said Robert, \" I will go and bear arms among strangers, and perhaps I shall obtain from them what is refused me in my own country.\" * He accordingly set out, and wandered through Flanders, Lorraine, and Germany, then through France and Aquit aine, visiting, says an old chronicler, dukes, counts, and rich lords of castles, relating his grievances and soliciting assistance. But a]J. the money he received he squandered on worthless associates. Queen Matilda, his mother, continued to remit him at various times sums of money, unknown to his father. In the end, however, her secret was betrayed to the king, who reproached his wife \" with supporting his enemies by the treasure he had placed in her keeping,\" and sternly forbade her to send any further supplies to Robert. Subsequently the messenger by whom she continued to send remittances \u2014 Samson, a Breton \u2014 was arrested, and William ordered his eyes to be put out. But the Breton succeeded in making his escape, and became a monk, \"for the salva tion both of body and soul.\"* After leading a wandering life for some time, Robert found his way to the French court. His cause was openly espoused by King Philip, who sent him to the castle of Gerberoy in Beauvoisis, on the confines of Normandy, where he was cordially wel comed by the two seigneurs who were the governors of the fortress. Here he gathered around him a body of adven turers from Normandy and other provinces, and disaffected subjects of his father, and even some of the officers of his household, whom he supported by plundering the neighbouring country. And so formidable did they become that at length the king himself crossed the Channel with a powerful army, and came in person to besiege the castle. One day in a sally made by the garrison Robert unwittingly engaged his father in person, and wounded and unhorsed him before he recognized his countenance under his helmet. Horror-stricken at the discovery, he raised the aged king from the ground, threw himself at his feet, and with a flood of tears entreated forgiveness. William, however, on being mounted by Robert on his own horse, rode away to his camp, utter ing maledictions on his undutiful son; and \u00a9 immediately relinquishing the siege of Ger beroy, he proceeded to Rouen. f His chiefs and bishops once more strove to reconcile father and son, but for a long time the king was deaf to their entreaties. \" Why,\" said he, \" do you solicit me in favour of a traitor who has seduced from me my soldiers ? those whom I have fed with my bread, and whom I have supplied with the arms they bear.\" The entreaties of the queen, joined to the solicitations of the barons, at last induced William to yield; and Robert, having re ceived his father's forgiveness, accompanied him to England. There was no confidence or cordiality, however, on either side; and ere long Robert, fearing that punishment for his offences would sooner or later be inflicted \u2666 Thierry, vol. i. p. 291. t Chron.

The Northumbrians accordingly repaired in great numbers, and with weapons concealed under their gar- ments, to Gateshead, near Newcastle, where the bishop held a court of justice. They requested in respectful terms that reparation should be made for the wrongs done them. \" I will not redress any of these,\" replied the bishop, \" unless you first give me four hundred pounds good money.\" But alarmed at the numbers of English that had now collected around the court, and their threat- ening aspect, he retired with all his retinue into the church. As he refused to come out and show himself, the people set fire to the church. On seeing the smoke and flames, Walcher caused the murderers of Liulf to be thrust out of the sacred building, and they were immediately cut to pieces. The passions of the people were now thoroughly roused; and when the bishop himself, half-suffocated with the heat and smoke, appeared at the threshold with the skirts of his gown wrapped over his face, a voice was heard among the crowd exclaim- ing, \"Short rede, good rede; slay ye the bishop.\" The command was instantly obeyed. Drawing their swords, the crowd fell upon Walcher and his foreign attendants, and put them all to death. The bishop's chaplain remained in the burning church till driven forth by the raging fire, when he was hacked to pieces; \"as he had well deserved,\" adds Holinshed, \"being the main promoter of all the mischief that had been done in the country.\" Upwards of a hundred Normans and Flemings perished with the bishop at Gateshead, and only two of his servants, Englishmen by birth, were spared. The insurgents then attacked the castle at Durham ; but finding it too strong and well garrisoned to be carried by assault, they relinquished the siege on the fourth day and dispersed. on him, for the third time fled from the court, and never returned during his father's lifetime. His departure was followed by a bitter malediction from his father, to which the historians of that age attribute the mis fortunes that subsequently befel the eldest son of the Conqueror. These fierce dissensions in the family of the reigning monarch produced no allevia tion in the condition of the English people ; and if the royal hand, in the absence of William, weighed less heavily upon them than formerly, the oppression of the Norman barons and clergy was more grievous than ever. Their tyranny was peculiarly oppres sive in the north, where the people bore the yoke with great impatience. Walcher de Lorraine, bishop of Durham, after the judi cial murder of Waltheof, had united to his ecclesiastical functions the government of the whole country north of the Tyne. \" The friends of the earl-bishop,\" says Thierry, \" loudly vaunted his administration, and praised him for equal skill in repressing the rebellions of the English by the edge of the sword, and in reforming their morals by the power of his discourses. The simple fact was that Walcher harassed his province by insupportable exactions ; that he allowed his officers after him to levy tributes on their own account ; and that he permitted his soldiers also to rob and murder with im punity.\" Liulf, an Englishman of noble birth, and beloved by the whole community, having been robbed by some of Walcher's retainers, made his complaint to their master, and was shortly after murdered by night in his manor-house, near Durham, by some persons in the bishop's service. This foul deed filled up the measure of Walcher's crimes. \" Hereupon,\" says an old writer, \"the malice of the people was kindled against him; and when it was known that he had received the murderers into his house, and favoured them as before, they stomached the matter highly.\" The old Northumbrian spirit wTas aroused against the lawless op pressor; nocturnal meetings were held, and it was resolved that signal vengeance should As soon as the tidings of these outrages reached Odo, bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of the king, and one of his lieutenants in his absence, he marched to Durham at the"], [165, "a.d. 1080-1083.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 127 head of a powerful force. He sound no body of insurgents in the field to resist him, but he treated the whole inhabitants as con spirators, and beheaded or mutilated without investigation or trial all the natives on whom he could lay his hands, and stripped of their possessions those whose lives he spared. This second devastation of Northumber land, added to the ravages made there by William in 1070, completed the ruin of this unhappy province, and made a historian who lived seventy years later say, \" Thus were cut the nerves of this country, once so flourishing. Those towns, formerly so re nowned, now so abased; those lofty towers, which threatened heaven, now in ruins; those pasture fields, once smiling and watered by sparkling rills, now wholly waste, the stranger who sees them beholds with a sigh \u2014 the old inhabitant now no longer abused his power as judge and earl ; of having ill-treated the English beyond mea sure, to the great danger of the common cause ; of having spoiled and robbed the churches of the country ; and, lastly, of having attempted to seduce and take with him out of the kingdom, and beyond the Alps, the soldiers of the king, upon whose fidelity the safety of England depended. \" Consider these grievances,\" said William to the council, \" and tell me how I ought to act towards such a brother.\" No one ven tured to reply. \" Arrest him, then,\" cried the king, \" and put him into safe custody.\" None of the nobles present, however, durst lay hands upon the bishop. But on per ceiving their hesitation to obey his orders, William himself then advanced and seized the prelate by the robe. \" I am a priest,\" cried Odo; \" I am a minister of the Lord; the pope alone can judge me.\" But the king, without relinquishing his hold, replied, \" I do not arrest you as a priest or a bishop, but as my earl, my vassal, and false viceroy.\" William had as little hesitation in throwing aside his broken tools when they had served their purpose as in crushing his enemies; and though not a few of the worst deeds of his brother had been perpetrated by his authority and for his service, the luckless prelate, instead of proceeding to Italy to prosecute his designs on the papacy, was forthwith conveyed to Normandy and im prisoned in the dungeon of a castle.* recognizes.* By this exterminating campaign Odo acquired the reputation of being \"one of the greatest quellers of the English ; \" but the infamy which he thus earned, combined with his ambition and pride, led to his ruin. Not contented with his offices of bishop of Bayeux in Normandy and grand justiciary of all England, and his double earldom of Kent and Hereford, he aspired to the ponti fical chair; and relying on a prediction of some Italian soothsayers, he commenced a series of intrigues at Rome; employed the enormous wealth he had accumulated by extortion and the selling of justice in brib ing the Roman senators; and made secret preparations for a visit to Italy attended by a brilliant escort. William was in Nor mandy when he heard of these projects, which for some reason or other excited his strong displeasure. He instantly set sail for England; and surprising Odo at the Isle of Wight, seized his treasures, and summoned the aspirant to the popedom to answer for his conduct before an assembly of the Nor man barons who were then in the island. Here William accused the bishop of \" un truth and sinister dealings ; \" of having In 1083 William lost his wife, Matilda, to whom he appears to have been sincerely attached, and who exercised a salutary influ ence on the iron character of the Conqueror. An old chronicler affirms that the counsels of the queen more than once softened the soul of her husband, and that she often pre vailed on him to show clemency towards the English people, but that after her death he abandoned himself without reserve to his tyrannical humour, and became more sus picious, jealous, and avaricious than ever. For some years after this he was kept in a state of anxiety by several threatened * William of Malmsbury Thierry, vol. i. 294 * Orderic Vital. Thierry, vol i p. 296."], [166, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1086-1087. 128 invasions of the Danes on a very extensive scale, but which came to nothing. They afforded him a pretext, however, for laying fresh burdens upon his subjects. He revived the odious tax called Danegelt; laid waste the district along the sea-coast, so that there remained \" neither man, nor beast, nor fruit tree,\" in order that it might not supply food or forage to the Danes if they should effect a landing; on various pretexts levied heavy contributions on the Normans themselves for the defence of the kingdom; and with the money thus amassed he hired and brought over from the Continent fresh hordes of foreign auxiliaries, who sorely oppressed the common people. A spirit of mutual distrust and secret hostility sprung up from this epoch between the Conqueror and his old associates, and charges of avarice and selfishness were bandied to and fro between them. stances a coarse and silly jest uttered by Philip provoked the English monarch to such a degree, that he swore a terrible oath that he would be revenged for the insult offered him. Entering France in the month of July, when the corn was almost ready for the sickle, and the trees laden with fruit, he ordered the whole country to be laid waste, the corn to be trodden down by his cavalry, the vines to be torn up, and the fruit trees cut down. Carrying desolation wherever they marched, his army was soon before the town of Mantes-sur-Seine, which offered but a feeble resistance. The ruthless Conqueror immediately gave orders that it should be set on fire, and the whole town, including even its churches and monasteries, was reduced to a heap of ashes. William's revenge, however, was fatal to his own life. As he was riding in the midst of the flames, enjoying the spectacle of the ruin, he had made his horse put his forefeet upon some burning embers, which caused him to plunge so violently that his rider, who was exces sively corpulent, was thrown with great force against the pommel of his saddle, and severely bruised. A rupture and inflammation of the intestines ensued, and combined with the heat of the weather and his own excite ment and advanced years, rendered his condition very dangerous. He was carried on a litter to Rouen, and thence, for the sake of relief from the noise and bustle of the streets, to the monastery of St. Gervais, outside of the city walls. There he lingered for six weeks, surrounded by physicians and priests ; his deathbed embittered by remorse for the crimes and cruelties he had committed. He sought to make re paration for his sins by sending money to Mantes to rebuild the churches he had burned, and liberal donations to the convents and poor of England, \" in order,\" says Robert of Gloucester, \" that he might obtain remission for the robberies he had committed there.\" The monks who ministered to him during his illness urged upon him the necessity of showing mercy to man, in order that he might obtain mercy from God, and The last years of William's reign were darkened, not only by the bitter alienation which had grown up between him and his barons, but by heavy domestic calamities. Richard, his second son, had been gored to death by a stag, or some say crushed by his horse against a tree, as he was hunting in the New Forest; \"the justice of God,\" as an old English chronicler remarks, \"punish ing in him his father's dispeopling of that country.\" Robert, his eldest son, was still an exile, and his two favourite sons, William and Henry, began to display a violent jealousy, and to disturb their father's declin ing years by their fierce contention for his good-will. About the end of the year 1086 William quitted England for the third and last time, and crossed the Channel, laden, says an old historian, with innumerable maledictions. He had an old dispute to settle with Philip I. of France respecting the county of Vexin, situated between the Epte and the Oise, which at one time belonged to Normandy, and which he hoped to recover by peaceable negotiations. Philip returned evasive replies to the demands of William, who meanwhile fell sick and kept his bed. In these circum-"], [167, "a.d. 1087.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 129 they at length wrung from him the release of his state prisoners, both English and Nor man, some of whom had languished in prison for many years. Among those who regained their liberty on this occasion were Earl Morcar, Siward, Bcorn, and Ulnoth, brother of King Harold, Roger, formerly earl of Hereford, and Odo, bishop of Bayeux, his own half-brother, whom he at first excepted from the amnesty, and was ultimately induced to pardon with the greatest reluctance. William, at the same time, took his departure for England to secure the expected crown. The Conqueror breathed his last at sun rise on the 20th of September, 1087, and his death made it painfully evident how little the respect and deference paid to him in his lifetime resulted from affection. The barons, physicians, and priests who had passed the night in his chamber, as soon as the breath was out of his body, hastily mounted their horses and rode off to their homes to look after their own interests. The servants of the deceased monarch, and vassals of lower rank, rifled his apartments of the arms, silver plate, clothes, and everything they could carry off, and then fled like their superiors, leaving the dead body of the mighty warrior and monarch lying almost naked on the bare boards. It remained thus abandoned for about three hours, till at last the priests and the monks thought of the duties which decency required that they should pay to the remains of their sovereign, and forming a procession, they went with a crucifix, can dles, and incense to the chamber where the corpse lay, and prayed for the soul of the deceased. The archbishop of Rouen gave orders that the body of the king should be interred at Caen in the church of St. Ste phen's, which William had built. But of all his numerous relations, his sons, his brothers, not one was present; none of his barons, or of the officers, attended to do honour to his obsequies ; and it was left to a private coun try gentleman named Herluin, \" out of his natural good nature and for the love of God,\" says an old chronicler, to undertake the trouble and expense of the funeral of the mighty Conqueror. As the procession moved through the town a fire suddenly broke out, and the attendants, priests and laymen alike, ran to extinguish it, leaving the brothers of St. Stephen's alone to carry the body to the church. Even the last burial service, the committing of dust to dust, did not pass without an incident strangely characteristic of the Conqueror's successful yet unprinci pled career. The grave had been prepared in the church, between the choir and the Robert, the eldest son of the Conqueror, was still a fugitive, and no attempt seems to have been made to recall him to his father's presence; but William Rufus and Henry were assiduous in their attendance on the deathbed of their father, waiting impatiently for the declaration of his last will. At length, a day or two before his death, William, in the presence of some of his barons and bishops, formally announced that he bequeathed the duchy of Normandy with its dependencies to his eldest son, who had already been recognized, both by the Norman barons and the king himself, as the heir to this province. \" As to the kingdom of England,\" continued the dying monarch, \" I leave it to no one, because I did not inherit it, but acquired it by force and at the price of blood ; I replace it in the hands of God, contenting myself with expressing the wish that my son William, who has ever been submissive to me in all things, may obtain it, if it please God, and prosper in it.\" \" And what will you give me, then, my father?\" eagerly demanded Henry, the youngest son. \" I give thee,\" was the answer, \" five thousand pounds in silver from my treasury.\" \" But what can I do with this money, if I have neither land nor house ?\" \" Be patient, my son,\" replied the king, \"and have confidence in God; allow thy elder brothers to precede thee ; thy time will come after theirs.\" * Henry immediately left his father's bedside to receive the five thousand pounds, which he carefully weighed and deposited in a strong coffer, well pro tected with good locks and iron bands. * Orderic Vital.

The truth of his statement was confirmed by many pre sent. After a brief discussion, the bishops agreed to pay him sixty shillings for the grave alone, and promised to procure him an equitable price for the rest of the land. The body of the king, clothed in royal robes, but without a coffin, was then lowered into the tomb; but in forcing it into the nar row aperture it burst asunder, and the rest of the ceremony having been hastily per formed the assembly dispersed. skilful soldier, and a vigorous and sagacious ruler.

But his great qualities were disfigured by inordinate ambition, selfish- ness, cunning, perfidy, and cruelty. He was entirely unscrupulous as to the means he used; the sword, the axe, and if uni- versal rumour can be trusted, the poisoned cup, were employed without hesitation to remove those who stood in his way. He was gathered to his fathers, says one of the writers of the Saxon chronicles, with \" loathing, disgust, and horror; \" and his miserable death and dishonoured burial were regarded in that age as a mark of Divine displeasure on account of the unjust con fiscations, the judicial murders, and the remorseless cruelties which he had per petrated.

William Rutus, who had left his father's bedside before he expired, heard of his death as he was on the point of embarking for England. The news served only to accele rate his movements. Odo Fitzherbert had already secured for him the important for tresses of Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings; and when William hastened to Winchester, where the treasure amassed by the Con queror was deposited, he found that his faithful partizan had induced the royal treasurer to surrender to him the keys. Rufus thus obtained possession of sixty thousand pounds in pure silver, besides a considerable sum in gold, and many precious stones. His next step was to demand from Lanfranc, the primate, investiture of the crown. Had Lanfranc refused, there can be little doubt that Rufus, would have lost the throne. But the primate was prepos sessed in his favour, both by affection and by a letter from the late king commending to him the cause of his favourite son. He refused, however, to declare in favour"], [169, "a.d. 1087-1088.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 131 of Rufus till that prince had given on oath a three-fold promise : that he would rule his subjects in justice, equity, and mercy; protect the rights and privileges of the church; and follow the counsels of the primate in all matters of importance. These demands were readily complied with by Rufus, and Lanfranc having by his influence and promises silenced all opposition in a hastily summoned council of the prelates and barons, he crowned his pupil at West minster, on the 27th of September, 1087, the eighteenth day after the Conqueror's death. Two days later, the English and Norman prelates and barons present swore the oath of fealty and accepted Wdliam as their king; and their example was speedily followed, though with secret reluctance, by the greater part of the Norman baronage then settled in England. unlike his younger brother, was generous and merciful, as well as eloquent in debate and well skilled in military affairs, but pro- fuse in expense, dissolute in morals, and equally rash and unsteady in resolve. He was fond of ease and pleasure, unable to deny any boon demanded by a favourite or courtier, and desirous only of leading a self- indulgent life. But his barons, though despising him for his indolence and facility, advised him, for their own selfish ends, to make war upon his brother ; and this enterprise was recommended with peculiar urgency by his uncle Odo, not so much from any preference of Robert to Rufus, as out of jealousy against the king's trusted counsellors, and especially his hatred of the primate Lanfranc, whom he regarded as the chief cause of all the calamities that had befallen him in the later years of the Con- queror's reign. But though Robert thus yielded to the advice of the Anglo-Norman barons to take up arms against the new king, his brother, he indolently delayed to place himself at their head untfl William had crushed the insurrection, and driven Odo and his principal associates into banish- ment. In his danger, the king had sought the aid of his native English subjects, whose hatred of their Norman oppressors induced them eagerly to answer the appeal by flock- ing to his standard; and he was indebted for his success chiefly to their services. These he indeed repaid only with empty thanks and hollow promises of future favour: but with the necessity which had obliged him to court their assistance arose the first dawn of their deliverance from bondage. From this epoch, throughout the contests by which the descendants of the Conqueror maintained their rival pretensions and deso lated the kingdom, the weight of the con quered race was more and more sensibly felt in the balance ; and it was only in the quarrels of their Norman tyrants that the Saxons slowly recovered their independence.* William's first act of authority was omi nous of his future career. The unfortunate English earls, Morcar and Wulnot, whom his father had set at liberty on his deathbed, had followed the new king to England in the hope of obtaining the restoration of at least some part of their estates. But Rufus caused them to be arrested at Winchester, and once more imprisoned. The Norman barons, however, who had been released from prison at the same time by the Con queror, were restored to their estates and honours ; and the legacies which he had bequeathed to the cathedrals and monas teries, and to the poor, were promptly paid. Robert, the eldest son of the Conqueror, was living in exile at Abbeville when he received the news of his father's death. He proceeded immediately to Rouen, and took possession of the inheritance bequeathed to him. Here he was speedily joined by Odo, the turbulent and ambitious bishop of Bayeux \u2014 successively the rapacious minis ter, the bold enemy, and the prisoner of the Conqueror \u2014 who quitted England soon after the coronation of Rufus, and became the chief counsellor of his brother. Robert, though brave and possessed of considerable abilities, was a very inefficient ruler. He, Not contented with expelling his brother's * Orderic. Vital, pp. 662-669. Chron. Sax. pp. 192-195.

A period was put to these hostilities by the exertions of the Norman nobles, whose interest it was, as generally holding lands under both princes in the kingdom and in the duchy, to preserve their possessions by maintaining their double allegiance. They therefore persuaded the brothers to conclude a pacification, by the principal article of which it was provided that the survivor of the two should succeed to the dominions of the other. The first use which Robert and William made of their reconciliation was to turn their arms against their younger brother, Henry, who had hitherto taken part with the duke. Having received for his portion by his father's will only five thousand pounds of sdver without landed domains,* this prince had endeavoured to form an establishment for himself by the purchase of some terri tories from Robert. The elder brothers, who both were jealous of his talents and rising importance, united to despoil him of these estates; and expelling him from the duchy, they drove him in great poverty to wander for some time over Brittany in quest of an asylum, f The perfidy of William, in refusing to perform one of the stipulated conditions of the late peace by delivering up the fortresses which he had acquired in Normandy, produced a second war between him and Robert, in which he maintained his advantage less by arms than by the dexterous application of bribes. The con test was terminated by the use of the same weapons in a different shape. Europe was now occupied with preparations for the First Crusade ; and Robert, inspired with the general passion to engage in that enterprise, but ever straitened for money by his prodi gality, offered with characteristic reckless ness the mortgage of his dominions to his brother, to obtain the means of equipping himself for the expedition. For the inade- quate sum of ten thousand marks, he offered him the government of Normandy for five years; and William eagerly closed with a proposal equally advantageous to his wily ambition and grateful to his fraudulent and over-reaching temper. Hoping, doubtless, to convert the temporary pledge into a per manent possession of the duchy, he extorted the money from his English subjects; and immediately assumed the administration of Normandy, which he continued to hold to his death.* The reign of William was distinguisned by few other events of importance. A war with the king of Scotland, a revolt of the Welsh, and a second rebellion of some of his barons, had consecutively divided his attention with his plans for the acquisition of Normandy. In revenge for the predatory incursions with which, during his absence in that duchy, the Scottish king had afflicted the northern counties, William led an army across the border, and obliged Malcolm to renew the homage which that prince had formerly rendered to his father. This submission did not prevent Malcolm from bursting into Northumberland two years afterwards with a numerous force ; but while engaged in ravaging that county he was surprised and slain, together with his eldest son, by the troops of its earl, Robert Mow bray; and the anarchy into which Scotland was plunged by this event suspended hostili ties (1093).f The issue of William's contest with the Welsh was less advantageous; for in the attempt, after the example of Harold, to chastise their insurrections against his supremacy by the invasion of their country, he was twice compelled to retreat both with loss and disgrace. But thenceforth resum ing the wise policy of his father, he con tented himself with strengthening the chain of fortresses which the Conqueror had con structed along the English frontier, or marches, to restrain the incursions of wild enemies, who were themselves inaccessible * Ordeiic.

Their second rebellion was headed by Mowbray, the powerful earl of Northumberland, and ap pears to have aimed at the dethronement of the king. But the activity of William dis concerted the conspiracy; Mowbray himself, after a vain resistance, was captured and imprisoned for the remainder of his life; and his accomplices were variously punished with death, banishment, or heavy fines on their estates, f dark picture, indeed, which the monkish historians have drawn of his infamous life, they might be suspected, under a natural prejudice against an oppressor of their order, to have exaggerated his vices, if the portrait were not both in harmony with every re corded transaction of his public reign, and fully confirmed by the report of the Saxon chronicler, who, in the favour affected by William to the English race, may be sup posed to have seen less reason for condemning his memory.* It cannot, therefore, be doubted, that the event which suddenly cut short his violent and flagitious career was a happy deliverance for his people. After the deep carouse of his noonday meal at Winchester, he had gone into the New Forest to hunt, and had separated from his attendants in eager pursuit of the game, when at sunset he was discovered by a poor charcoal-burner lifeless and weltering in his blood on the earth, with the broken shaft of an arrow sticking in his breast. In the same forest one of his brothers had formerly perished accidentally while engaged in the chase ; and it could not fail to excite the remark of a superstitious age that he was the second of his family who, by the retributive vengeance of Heaven met a violent death on the same scene which had been cruelly desolated for his pleasures (2nd August, 1100). f The principal feature in the domestic administration of William's reign was un- \u00a9 bounded rapacity; and his extortions reached every class of his subjects. But the wealth of the church especially tempted his cupidity; and taking advantage of a schism and con sequent weakness in the papacy to refuse a recognition either of Urban II. or of the Antipope Clement, he kept many sees and abbeys vacant, and appropriated their rich revenues to his own uses. The death of the virtuous and able Primate Lanfranc (1089), whose services in obtaining for him the crown he repaid with the basest ingratitude and oppression, removed every obstacle to his schemes of spoliation, and left the Eng lish church at his mercy. He refused for four years to fill up the vacant archbishopric : until during a fit of remorse, produced by a dangerous illness, he was persuaded to name, as successor to Lanfranc, an ecclesiastic of similar character, the learned and celebrated Anselm. But with returning health he began to oppress the new primate as he had done the last; and by persecuting him with demands for money, which an impoverished see was unequal to supply, finally drove him to seek refuge from these exactions in a voluntary exile. J The sums of which the king thus rapaciously plundered his lay and ecclesiastical subjects, he as prodigally consumed in the grossest debaucheries, or lavished on the vilest of minions. In the As soon as the report of the king's death reached the knights and courtiers who had been hunting in the forest, they hastily dis persed in all directions to look after their own interests. Not one of the venal and heartless tribe remained to render the last honours to their master, whose body, defiled with blood and dust, was carried next day in the charcoal-burner's cart to the cathedral church of Winchester, and buried in the centre of the choir.

Henry, his youngest bro ther, who seems to have reconciled himself with William, and was living at his court, had gone with him to hunt in the New Forest on the day of his death, and no sooner heard that he was slain than he gal loped back to Winchester, possessed himself of all the money which the prodigality of the late king had left in the royal treasury, and employed it with so much address and promptitude, as, only three days afterwards, to secure his coronation at Westminster. In thus audaciously usurping his eldest bro ther's rights, he declared that he had received the crown by the common consent of all the barons of the realm ; and he immediately proceeded to conciliate both the clergy and the nation by promulgating a charter of liberties, in which he bound himself to restore and respect the ancient immunities of the church, to keep no sees or benefices vacant, to abstain from the arbitrary exac tions with which his father and brother had burdened the feudal incidents, and to revive the laws of King Edward with the Con queror's amendments. While the first two of these provisions gratified the ecclesiastical order and the crown vassals of Norman blood, the third was more especially acceptable to the whole English race, whose attachment to the laws of their fathers had been increased to enthusiasm by the oppression of their foreign tyrants. The next measure of Henry was still more pleasing to his Saxon subjects. He espoused Matilda, or Maud, daughter of Malcolm, king of Scotland, who, through her mother Margaret, sister of the Atheling Edgar, was descended from the royal Saxon line, and destined by this marriage to mingle the blood of the house of Cerdic with that of the Norman dynasty. The nuptials of Henry with this virtuous and beautiful princess, long affectionately remembered by the English as \" good Queen Molde,\" were solemnized by Archbishop Anselm, who had now returned from his exile; and she was at the same time crowned by the primate with much formality.* the circumstances is, that he was shot by an arrow in the New Forest, and that his body was abandoned by his attendants, and then hastily interred. According to the common tale, which originated in the report of the time, William was accidentally shot by Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, who in dismay, immediately putting spurs to his horse, fled to the sea coast and crossed to the Continent, where he joined the First Crusade as an expiation for this involuntary homicide. But it has been satisfactorily shown that Tyrrel, on his return from Palestine, when he had no longer any motive of hope or fear in concealing the truth, made frequent and solemn declara tions that he never saw the king on the day of his death, or entered that part of the forest in which he fell. It may be suspected, from the hatred which his rapacious tyranny had provoked, that William died by treason; it was easy and politic to attribute his fate to an absent individual; and his successor, as Dr. Lingard has observed, was little solicit ous to inquire into the real character of the event which raised him to the throne.* William was killed in the thirteenth year of his reign, and in the fortieth of his age. He was never married. William possessed considerable natural abilities, and was ener getic and courageous. But he was intem perate, licentious, covetous, and tyrannical, and his memory was long held in abhorrence by the people of England. Henry I. \u2014 a.d. 1100-1135 Robert, duke of Normandy, both by the claims of primogeniture and the faith of treaties the rightful successor of William, was now on his return from the crusade in Southern Italy: where, in ignorance of the catastrophe which should have given him the crown, he lingered to wed the fair and noble Sybilla, a maiden of the Norman race of Guiscard.

Matt."], [173, "a.d. 1100-1106.1 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 135 William had been dead only one month when Robert arrived in Normandy ; but with his usual want of energy, instead of imme diately asserting his right to the English throne, the duke of Normandy allowed the usurper, by the completion of these popular measures, to establish himself firmly in his seat, before he could be roused to some tardy and insufficient exertions in support of his own cause. At length, by the suggestions of Flambard, bishop of Durham, the infamous minister of the late king's extortions, who had been imprisoned by Henry to gratify the people, but had effected his escape into Normandy, Robert was persuaded to claim the crown of England. He therefore accepted the proffered allegiance and aid of many of the most powerful barons in the kingdom, who were either averse to the usurpation or disaffected to the person of Henry. Land ing at Portsmouth, he placed himself at the head of a party which embraced the majority of the Anglo-Norman nobility; while the clergy, headed by the Primate Anselm, and the native English in general, adhered to Henry. The undoubted martial talents of Robert, the renown which he had acquired in the Holy War, the justice of his pretensions, and the natural popularity of his generous temper, might seem to promise him an im mense superiority in the impending contest over the unnatural brother, who had basely profited by his absence on the sacred service of Heaven to usurp his inheritance. But all these advantages were more than over- \u00a9 balanced by the artful ability of Henry, and the facile temper of Robert himself. The latter credulously acceded to the proposal of his wily brother for a personal conference; was reconciled to him at the first interview; and suffered himself to be beguiled into a treaty by which, for a yearly pension of three thousand marks, he resigned all title to the crown of England.* Henry, in violation of one of its conditions, began grievously to oppress the nobles of his party ; and many of these powerful men were successively ruined, either by vexatious suits in the King's Court, or by bolder sen tences of outlawry and confiscation. When Robert, with the generous desire of inter posing his good offices in behalf of his friends, incautiously, and unattended by an armed force, made a second journey into England, he found that, instead of being able to intercede for others, he was himself in effect a captive. Nor did he recover his liberty until he had engaged to resign his pension, which, to cover its dishonourable exaction with the hollow semblance of gal lantry, Henry compelled his queen nominally to receive as a gift to herself. After this evil usage, Robert, full of indignation at the perfidy of his brother, retired to his Norman duchy; and in the protection which he now openly granted to the English outlaws, who had suffered from their assistance to his cause, Henry soon found or framed a suffi cient pretence for hostility. Pronouncing the existing league of friendship between them annulled by the encouragement given to these traitors, and declaring that he came to relieve Robert's Norman subjects from the notorious and increasing disorders of his government, he landed in the duchy with an army from England, and, after one inde cisive campaign, succeeded in bringing the duke's forces to action under the ramparts of Tenchebrai. Here, notwithstanding the brilliant valour and skilful conduct of Robert, which were never more conspicuous than in this his last fatal field, his troops, after a long and bloody contest, were completely routed, and himself was captured. By ex torting from his prisoner an order for the surrender of all his fortresses, Henry now obtained complete possession of the duchy; and the Norman barons immediately swore allegiance to him as their duke.* Robert Robert had no sooner returned to Nor mandy on the conclusion of this peace, than \u2022 Ordeiic.

The unhappy Robert survived the execution of this inhuman sentence nearly thirty years, which he passed in darkness and captivity; and at last died at the age of eighty, in his prison of Cardiff castle, about twelve months before his unnatural op pressor (1135).* and policy the rightful heir of Robert found some potent supporters in Louis V., king of France, and the counts of Anjou-. and Flanders. The French king promised to grant William the investiture of Normandy, and Foulques of Anjou engaged to bestow on him the hand of his daughter Sibylla as soon as he should be of proper age. Before that period arrived, however, in 1113, hostilities broke out between the Eng lish monarch and the allies of his nephew; and the former met with several reverses. But after the war had lasted for two years, Henry contrived to put an end to it by a skilful treaty, in which the interests of William Fitz-Robert were completely for gotten. In no long time, however, dissen sions once more broke out between the new allies, mainly in consequence of Henry's failure to perform his promises to the count of Anjou; and he sought to strengthen him self for the coming struggle by bestowing the hand of his daughter, Matilda, upon the Emperor Henry V. ; but this very act, which secured him the aid of a powerful distant friend, alienated from him one more impor tant, because nearer the future scene of contest. Robert, count of Flanders, in return for a subsidy which enabled him to join the adventurers to the Holy Land, had for many years past enrolled himself as a vassal of Henry; since his return from the Crusades he had been incessantly involved in war with the emperor; and no sooner, therefore, did he receive intelligence of this treaty of marriage with England than he abandoned his alliance with Henry, and proffered himself to Louis. Henry, however, although triumphant over his reckless and ill-fated brother, was destined to reap little enjoyment from his success. On the surrender of the Norman fortresses after the capture of Robert, that prince's infant son William (afterwards sur named Cliton, or Court-cuisse), also fell into his hands ; but under some momentary feel ing of pity for the boy's tears, and distrustful perhaps of the darker impulses of his own heart, he placed his nephew beyond his power by committing him to the guardian ship of Helie de St. Saen, a Norman lord, who had married the natural daughter of the deposed duke. Of this act of mercy the jealous tyrant too soon repented; but when he endeavoured again to seize the person of the child, Helie succeeded in with drawing his charge from danger; and nobly preferring the abandonment of his own fiefs to the betrayal of his trust, he fled with young William from Normandy. Wander ing from one asylum to another, the generous guardian, despite of the familiarity of his barbarous times with the worst deeds of violence and wrong, won sympathy and pro tection for his innocent and helpless charge ; and from mingled motives of compassion Foulques V. of Anjou, who had recently succeeded his infamous father, Foulques le Rechin, alarmed by numerous demonstra tions of Henry's ambition, had likewise closely connected himself with France; and Louis, seconded by these powerful associates, was well prepared to meet that conflict with Normandy to which singly he must have proved altogether unequal. The immediate and ostensible cause of hostilities This is the last time that the name of Edgar occurs in history. Henry, like his father, showed his contempt for the Saxon prince by granting pardon and liberty to his insignificance ; and he is said to have peaceably survived in neglect and obscurity to a great age. * Matt.

The king of France proposed a single combat to his adversary; and some light gallants of the camp, with no small failure of respect to their sovereigns, named as the most sitting lists a shattered bridge on the river Epte, which at every moment was threatened by the stream with entire destruction.* The king of England replied that the stakes were manifestly too advan tageous to his enemy. For himself, the castle was already in his possession, and he could not therefore win anything even if he should conquer; his rival, on the contrary, if successful, would add substantial gain to his glory. A war of little interest and various fortune succeeded; in its progress Louis was deprived of his most faithful ally, the count of Flanders, who was killed by a fall from his horse; and deserted by Foulques of Anjou, for whom had been spread the glittering snare of an intermar- riage between his daughter and William, heir-apparent of England. Thibaud, count of Meaux, Blois, and Chartres, a nephew of Henry, was devoted to his interests; Bald- win, the new count of Flanders, was yet in extreme youth, and fully occupied in his own dominions; the remoter vassals of the French crown remained neutral and uncon- cerned spectators; and many of the petty retainers in the county of Paris were in open revolt. Thus straitened, Louis consented to a disadvantageous peace, the chief provisions of which were the abandonment of Maine promised marriage; the Norman barons for the most part were discontented, and readily listened to the king of France when he offered to restore their legitimate prince, William Cliton, now sufficiently old for the active cares of government. In the first campaign, Louis invaded Normandy; but found it so well guarded that he passed but a single night within the hostile territory, and retired without offering battle. The co-operation instead of the neutrality of Foulques was now most important to him ; and it was purchased by a grant replete with the spirit of feudalism. The counts of Anjou claimed the high dignity of grand seneschal of France, as hereditarily attached to their fief from the time of Lothaire. By their own neglect, or by opposition to the crown, the chief functions of that office, which were to place the dishes on the royal table on days of ceremony, had long been administered by other hands. A compro mise, however, was effected; AVilliam de Garlanda, the executive officer, consented to pay homage as deputy seneschal to Foulques, his chief; and the count of Anjou, sovereign of a principality scarcely inferior in extent to the kingdom which Louis himself governed, obtained the high favour of being numbered among the principal household servants of the king of France, and engaged in return to assist him in attacking Normandy* * Du Cange, ad v. Scnesculcus, has collected an infinity of lore respecting the great seneschal of France. Hugues de Cleriis, one of the chief retainers of Foulques, and employed by him in this negotiation, has left an account of it (De Majoratu et Senescalcia Franci\u00e6, ap Hist, des Gaules, xii. 495), from which we learn many particulars of the etiquette of French royalty in the twelfth century. Whenever the grand seneschal came to court, the king's marshals were bound to provide him convenient lodging. The seneschal (his deputy) was to precede him to his apartment, announce his arrival to tbe king, conduct him to the palace, and reconduct him to his hotel. Whenever the king, wearing his crown and in full state, dined in public, the grand seneschal sat on a chsir covered with rich tapestry till the first course was served ; then rising and taking off his robes (se desibulans) he received the dishes from the seneschal, and placed them before the king and queen. The same he did also with the remaining courses. After the dinner was ended, the grand seneschal, attended by the seneschal, rode home on a war-horse, which he presented to the king's cook as his fee. His robes were the fee of the king's steward.

The campaign opened with the loss of an advanced post on either side: Henry sur prised the castle of Sainte Claire; Louis mastered the convent of Saint Ouen by stratagem. The few soldiers whom he headed were disguised as monks, and no sooner had they presented themselves at the gates under that holy garb, than they were unhesitatingly opened ; nor did the inmates discover their mistake till the king bared his sword from under his frock. The garrison with which he continued to occupy these walls was of material use in harassing Normandy.* The count of Flanders, on the other hand, ravaged the north of that duchy; till his rash ardour exposed him to a danger ous wound, which carelessness and intem perance rendered mortal. The savage and unnatural spirit of the times, or at least of some of the chief actors in them, was forcibly exhibited by the incidents of the year following. Henry had given the hand of an illegitimate daughter, Juliana, to Eustache of Breteuil ; and the count, profiting by the embarrassments of his father-in-law, endea voured to obtain from him a grant of the castle of Ivry, a former possession of his family. The king of England refused the demand ; but in order to convince Eustache that the fortress was not retained with any evil intention, he placed in his hands the governor's son as a hostage, and in return received two daughters of Eustache by Juliana. Eustache, fondly believing that no breach of faith which he might commit would be visited upon his innocent children by their grandfather, summoned the governor of Ivry to surrender, and on his refusal tore out the eyes of his hostage, and dismissed him to his unhappy parent. The governor demanded vengeance from Henry, and was permitted to exercise similar * brutal reprisals on the daughters of the count of Breteuil. When Eustache, on this outrage, had re course to open hostilities, the inhabitants of his capital opened their gates to Henry, and Juliana, who was in the town at the moment, scarcely succeeded in throwing herself into the citadel. Henry closely invested that fortress ; and when her provisions began to fail, Juliana sought to capitulate, invited her father to a parley, and treacherously attempted his assassination. The king in revenge destroyed the bridge which con nected the castle with the town ; and when he granted terms they were cruel, unmanly, and dishonourable. The father refused his own daughter any other mode of exit than such as she could provide by lowering herself with her hands from the walls ; and this indecorous and ignominious exposure took place amid the rude jests and licentious mockery of the besieging army. It was in the depth of winter; the ditch in which she dropped was filled to the brim with water; and shivering with cold, and overwhelmed with shame and terror, she at length gained its outer brink. t king's army, the seneschal was to furnish him with a pavilion capable of entertaining one hundred persons, to provide him with beasts of burden for its carriage, ropes and pecs, a horseman and two footmen. If the grand seneschal pleased, he might, at the end of the campaign, give this pavilion to the seneschal ; but even if he retained it, he was not by so doing to bar his right to a new one in the campaign following. If the king advanced, the grand seneschal commanded the van; if he retreated, the rear; and whatever might occur he was not to be visited with any reproach from the royal mouth. Whatever judgment the grand seneschal should pronounce in France was to be irreversible and without repeal. On the contrary, if a sentence of the French judges were disputed, an appeal lay to the grand seneschal. If he could not obey the king's summons and decide in person, the documents on either side were to be forwarded to him, and his determination was to be final. Hugh de Cleriis adds, that he has witnessed the grand seneschal's administration of every one of these rights. It can be no matter of surprise, therefore, that Foulques was desirous of so important an office. When the connection of the house of Anjou with England transferred the grand seneschalship to the royal line of the latter country, Robertus de Monte states that on the Feast of the Purification, in 1169 Henry, son of the king of England, performed the duties of the office at the royal table in Paris. * Ordericus Vitalis, xi. ap.

Deprived of both his allies, Louis still continued an active and incessant warfare of pillage and incursions; and unable from want of suffi cient numbers to perform the part of a skilful general, he enacted to the full that of a brave and adventurous knight. It was on the twentieth of August that the two kings unexpectedly found themselves in each other's presence in the plain of Brenne ville, near Noyon. Henry's force amounted to no more than five hundred horse. Louis had about one hundred less. At the first charge the English gave way, and Henry himself was wounded by a knight named William Crispin. So forcible were the two blows which the Frenchman struck upon the king's helmet, that, although it was of good proof and inpenetrable, blood flowed from his head. Henry, in return, with a single stroke overthrew both horse and man, who were taken prisoners at his feet. * Then rallying the English, he succeeded in capturing eighty Norman knights, the fol lowers of William Cliton, whose horses had been killed under them. The second charge of the French was wholly unsuccessful, and as they were put to the rout, an English soldier caught the bridle of Louis, and shouted, \" The king is taken !\" \" You are a bad gamester, my friend,\" answered Louis; \" do you not know that at chess the king is never taken?\" f and with the words he dealt a blow which struck the fancied captor lifeless from his saddle. Then clapping spurs to his horse, he galloped into an adjoining wood, in which he wandered for some hours, till the guidance of a peasant, ignorant of his person, placed him in security at Andely. The chief loss of the French was in prisoners, of whom one hundred and forty were taken; for so surely fenced were the knights by their complete armour, that three only, both sides included, were killed in the battle. Henry made a generous use of his victory; he released many of his prisoners; sent back to Louis his royal standard, which had been captured;* and permitted his son William to restore his horse and arms to his cousin of Normandy. The quarrel between the Emperor Henry V. and the Holy See was now at its height, and Calixtus II., unable to dispute the possession of Rome with the Antipope Gregory VIII., whom Henry had elected, found refuge in France, and assembled a council at Rhefms. Louis, smarting under his recent defeat, appealed to this council for protection, and on the representations of the pope, Henry consented to peace. The conditions are unknown to us; but it is plain that they involved an abandonment of the claims of William Cliton on Nor mandy, since Louis received homage from William the prince of England on investi ture with that fief. The loss of his only son, that grievous calamity which embittered the remainder of Henry's days, immediately followed this peace ; and the Normans, emboldened by the uncertainty of the English succession, and by secret promises of assistance from France, proclaimed William Cliton their duke, be fore three years had elapsed from the close of the late war. It seems probable that Henry I. destined the crowns both of Eng land and of Normandy for his daughter Matilda, empress of Henry V. ; and if this prospective increase of German power occa sioned jealousy in France, it was a still more powerful motive for the union of the imperial arms with those of England. The emperor's pretext for hostility was the non interference of the French king to pre vent an excommunication which had been * Henricus Huntindoniensis, vii. ad ann. ap. Hist, des Gaules, xiii. 35.

The emperor retired ; the king of England addressed himself to the reduction of Nor mandy ; a peace, with the conditions of which we are unacquainted, terminated the quarrel without an engagement ; and the death of Henry V. in the following year, and the consequent extinction of the house of Franconia, relieved France from all appre hension of any undue aggrandizement of the empire, by the testamentary disposition of the king of England. The widowed Empress Matilda was reluctantly compelled by her father to renew the marriage con tract with Geoffrey Plantagenet, son of Foulques of Anjou; and thus at the expense of her domestic happiness to give to Eng land some of the most illustrious of her future princes. launched against him at the council of Rheims ; and burning to revenge that affront, he raised a powerful army for the invasion of Champagne. The forces with which Louis opposed him have no doubt been greatly exaggerated by the contemporary historian of his reign; but it is plain from the result of the campaign that his levies were formidable, and that the French, esteeming the present war to be directed, not personally against their king, but generally against themselves and their country, placed at his disposal a much larger body of men than any former monarch of his race had commanded. Suger, abbot of St. Denis, the biographer and one of the chief ministers of Louis, headed the vassals of his church, and presented to the king before the high altar the Oriflamme, or sacred banner, which then for the first time accompanied the French armies to battle.* In the gathering at Rheims, says this inflated and grandilo quous writer, so great was the number of warriors that they seemed to devour the surface of the earth, as if they had been The life of that young prince presented some vicissitudes of fortune, remarkable even in an age of romantic adventure. When deserted for a season by Louis, he still found protection at the court of Flanders, until the following year produced an event which was calculated to rekindle the most ambi tious of his hopes. This was the death of his cousin and namesake William, the only legitimate son of Henry ; who, after receiving the investiture of Normandy, in triumph antly crossing to England from that duchy with a splendid train of its youthful nobility, perished by shipwreck in the night, near Harfleur, owing to the general riot and intoxication which prevailed on board his vessel, and amidst which she was suffered * The Oriflamme was a square gonfalon of flame-coloured silk, with its lower part cut into three swallow-tails, without any blazonry (although in a vignette representing the scene described in the text, prefixed to vol. xii. of the Kecueil des Historiens des Gaules, it is represented parsemee with fleur de lis), fringed with green silk, and suspended from a golden lance. Gulielmus Brito has accurately described this standard : \u2014 \" At regi satis est tenues crispare per auras Vexillum simplex, cendato simplice textum. Splendoris rubri, Lethania qualiter uti Ecclesiana solet certis ex more diebus : Quod cum Flamma habeas vulgariter Auiva nomcn, Omnibus in bellis habet omnia signa pr\u00e6ire ; Quod regi pr\u00e6stare solet Dionysiu- Abbas, Ad bellum quoties sumptis proficiscitur armis.\" Pliilippeis, xi. 32. I)u Cange, ad v. Auriflamma, prefers Flammula, or Flam mulum, a word used by writers of the Middle Ages for any banner. Tradition assigned to it a divine origin, and it was commonly said to have been brought from heaven either to Clovis or Charlemagne. It was, in truth, no other than the peculiar banner of tiie monastery of St. Denis, carried in its religious processions and private wars, and borne by the counts of Vexin, Vidames and Avoue's of the abbey. Philip I. having united that county to the crown, became seized of all its rights; and bis warlike son therefore adopted the custom by which the Oriflamme was received from the abbot, before the altar, at which the king kneeled, uncovered and unbelted. The Oriflamme was not used in the wars of Charles VII. because the English were in possession of St. Denis; and the victories which were then obtained without its presence greatly diminished the reverence once paid it. Felibien states, that after the entry of Henry IV. into Paris, in 1594, it was found in the treasury of the abbey, covered with dust and half moth-eaten. to run upon a rock. The young prince, whose premature vices, as well as his avowed and insolent contempt of the English race,f notwithstanding his maternal descent from the royal Saxon stock, had already excited gloomy forebodings of a tyrannical reign, M. de Sismondi, perhaps inclining to the opposite extreme, diminishes them to twenty or twenty-five thousand, v. 177. t Orderic.

He might have been saved, if the shrieks of his natural sister Adela, countess of Perche, had not induced him to return to the wreck, when the crowd which leaped into his boat immediately sank it. The ship itself soon after went down with all on board; and the only survivor of the whole party was a poor butcher of Rouen, who rescued himself by clinging to a spar. Fitz-Stephen, the master of the bark, a stout swimmer, might have shared his preserva tion ; but hailing the butcher from the water to inquire the fate of the prince, and being told that he had perished, the luckless mar iner exclaimed that he would not outlive him, and instantly disappearing never rose more. When Henry, who had preceded his son in the voyage, and had arrived at South ampton, received the news of this dreadful catastrophe, the shock struck him to the ground; and it is said that from that hour he was never seen to smile again.* the Norman barons in favour of his nephew; and Louis in a new war which he under took, partly in the same cause, gained no decisive advantages. But in the growing \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 fame and greatness of the new earl of Flan ders, his usurping uncle had increased cause to tremble for the safety of his continental domains : when the death of William from the effects of a slight but neglected wound, which he received in a petty skirmish against a pretender to his Flemish fief, unexpectedly relieved Henry from his dangerous embar rassments.* The great remaining end of his reign was now to secure the succession to his dominions for his beloved daughter Matilda. After the untimely fate of his son, the king himself, already a widower by the death of the \" good Queen Molde,\" concluded a second marriage with the young and beauti ful Adelais, daughter of the duke of Louvain : but being disappointed of issue by this union , his whole affections, as well as bis hopes of seeing his race perpetuated, rested on his daughter. As Matilda was without children by her first marriage with the Emperor Henry V., he had been anxious, after the death of that monarch, to form a second alliance for her; and had therefore compelled her to marry Geoffrey Plantagenet,f eldest son of Foulques, count of Anjou, the heredi tary enemy of his house, whom he was desirous by this measure to detach from the interest of his nephew William. This second union was extremely distasteful to Matilda, whose haughty spirit ill disposed her to exchange the imperial honours which she yet enjoyed in her German residence for the inferior state of a countess, and still less to submit at her maturer age to the control of a wild and impetuous youth of sixteen. She, however, yielded to her father's com mands ; and though her own temper and that of Geoffrey tended equally to destroy The parental sorrow of the king was soon aggravated by fresh accessions of political disquietude. His only surviving legitimate child was his daughter Matilda, whom he had married to the Emperor Henry V. ; and his bereavement of a male heir encouraged the partisans of his nephew, William, to excite new commotions in Normandy. That young prince was becoming daily more for midable, no less by the development of many vjrtuous, able, and enterprising qualities, than by the support which the French king again afforded to his just and dangerous pretensions. Louis bestowed on him the hand of his sister-in-law, with a large landed dowry on the Norman frontiers; and the great fief of Flanders becoming vacant soon after by the assassination of its count, his royal benefactor also granted him the inves titure of that province, to which he had some claims by descent from his grand mother, Matilda, wife of the Conqueror, and daughter of a former earl. Henry, indeed, succeeded in quelling a revolt of * Orderic. Vital, pp. 870-886. Chron. Sax. p. 232. t This name, which the royal descendants of Geoffrey covered with renown, was derived from his device, a sprig of broom, or plante dt genet; or, perhaps, as some have con jectured, from the passion for the chase which detained him perpetually among the heather.

Both this intermarriage, indeed, with a hostile house, and the prospect of a female succession, as without precedent either in England or Normandy, excited equal disgust among the Anglo-Norman nobility. But the king disregarding every murmur, had obliged an assembly of prelates and nobles, comprising all the immediate vassals or tenants in capite of the crown, to swear fealty to his daughter, then still a widow, in case he himself should die without male issue. Subsequently he not only insisted upon his reluctant vassals renewing their oaths on her marriage, but took advantage of the birth of her eldest son by Geoffrey Plantagenet, who was named after himself, to convene a third general council, at which all the nobility and dignified clergy again solemnly pledged their reversionary alle giance to her, and extended it to the new born infant. A dispute for precedence, as first prince of the blood, which was main tained on these occasions between Stephen earl of Boulogne, the king's nephew, by Adcla, daughter of the Conqueror, and Robert, earl of Gloucester, his own natural son, might have given Henry an ominous foreboding of the views which were con cealed under this rivalry. The decision of the question in favour of Stephen, instructed all those who were averse from a female succession secretly to look up to him as their future sovereign; and the doubt re specting the claims of Matilda to the throne entertained in that age, although in modern views of regal inheritance her right was unquestionable, predisposed the mass of the nation to acquiesce in the designs which the The character of Henry is, in many re spects, sufficiently developed in the preced ing sketch of his reign ; and if the perfidious acquisition of temporal greatness were truly the evidence of wisdom, his memory might deserve the emphatic distinction with which he is dignified by some contemporary writers, as the wisest prince of his times. But his abilities were exercised only in the artifices of a faithless and cunning policy; his triumphs over less wily antagonists were purchased, not by glorious achievements, but by bribes and seductions ; and the lives of fewmonarchs have better illustrated the trite but unchange able moral, that the paths of ambition lead only to disquietude and misery. The enjoy ment of his boasted success against his foreign enemies was blighted by his domestic cala mities ; his projects for the aggrandizement of his daughter produced nothing but vexa tion to himself and unhappiness to her; and even his political sagacity and foresight were mocked by the abortive issue of his solici tude for her interest. A cruel brother, a suspicious and tyrannical master, and an incontinent husband, his deep affection for his children was indeed the only redeeming quality of his heart. t He was celebrated in his own age for his learning, which procured him the surname of Beauclerc; and he has been praised in later times for his vigilant execution of the laws : whereby he certainly so far conferred a benefit on his people, that the most flagrant and violent crimes of rob bery and spoliation, which were rife in the land at his accession, became before his death almost unknown, t. future usurper already cherished. Henry, however, seems to have been unconscious of the precarious tenure of those obligations by which he had attempted to settle the crown on his daughter's head.

Throughout his reign he systematically excluded the native English, to whose support and fidelity he was chiefly indebted for the success and security of his usurpation, from every civil and ecclesiastical office of trust or emolu ment.* He extorted enormous fines in commutation for all offences ; and the riches which he accumulated in immense sums, considering the value of money at that epoch, besides his great expenditure in fur thering schemes of continental aggrandize ment, were unfeelingly wrung from the necessities of an oppressed and impoverished people. f His extortions were those of a despotic tyranny, which utterly neglected any equal adjustment of its burdens, and cruelly punished as a crime the poverty which it created. \" It were not easy to relate,\" says Roger de Hoveden, \" all that the land of Englishmen endured at this time (about the year 1103) because of the royal exactions.\" % \" God knoweth,\" exclaims the Saxon chronicler, \"how unjust a measure is dealt to this miserable people : first they are despoiled of their goods, then butchered. If a man possess anything, it is taken from him : if nothing, he is left to die of hunger.\" \" This (1124) was a grievous year: whoever had any possessions remaining, now lost them by heavy taxes and iniquitous decrees.\" \u00a7 When we contemplate these simple and touching pictures of popular suffering, it is a small extenuation of the tyrant's guilt that he pursued public malefactors with so much rigour and severity as to be accounted by his terrified subjects the \" Lion of Justice \" foretold in the sabulous prophecies of Merlin ; that he punished the licensed coiners for their debasement of the currency with death or mutilation ; and that his vengeance equally overtook the purveyors and attendants of his own court, whose spoliations and outrages during the royal progresses had compelled the inhabitants to flee and leave the country a desert before him.* It could scarcely improve the lot of his subjects that the king, himself the worst robber in his realm, was determined to suffer no sharer in the spoil. The ecclesiastical affairs of his reign be long to another division of our subject; and it may suffice to observe in this place, that the clergy were not much more fortunate than other ranks of men in escaping his rapacity. One contemporary writer, indeed, himself an ecclesiastic, excludes the Norman superiors of his order from the sympathy of his readers by declaring that they were \"rather wolves than shepherds:\" but some curious instances are given of the king's expedients for plundering them. Notwith standing his solemn promise on his acces sion, he imitated his brother's example by keeping many sees vacant for years, that he might enjoy their revenues; and he usually sold the nomination of those which he filled up. When the bishops in council petitioned him to assist them in enforcing the canon of celibacy, he gladly undertook the office, and exercised it in the sale of licenses to those ecclesiastics who were willing to purchase the indulgence of retaining their wives. Upon an earlier occasion, under the pretence of supporting the decree of a synod which had prospectively forbidden the marriage of priests, he instituted a com mission of inquiry into the conduct of the clergy on this head: when finding, as it is said, the number of delinquents fall short of expectation, he was so determined not to lose the profit which he had anticipated, that he ordered a heavy fine to be levied on every parish priest without regard to the transgression or observance of the canon * * Eadmer, pp. 94-110. t Chron.

But relying on his influence and popularity, and the ad- vantage which, at the moment of Henry's death, his residence at Boulogne gave him over Matilda, who was living with her husband in the more distant province of Anjou, he hastened to London, was received with acclamations by its citizens, and im- mediately caused himself to be proclaimed king of England. By the assistance of his brother, the bishop of Winchester, that city, with its castle and the royal treasures which it contained, was betrayed into his hands; and the two powerful prelates of Canterbury and Sarum also were gained over to his cause. The former, indeed, affected to feel some scruples in violating the oaths which he had taken to Matilda; but he allowed them to be removed by the audacious per jury of Bigod, steward of the late king's household, who, at the instigation of the bishop of Winchester, deliberately swore that Henry on his death-bed had disin- herited his daughter and appointed Stephen his successor; and upon pretence of being satisfied by this miserable fraud, the primate consented to place the crown on the head of the usurper. The ceremony of the coro- nation was performed at Westminster with indecent haste, before the other prelates or the barons of the realm had time to arrive or declare their assent; but a lavish use of the late king's treasures, and the ready pro- mulgation of a charter promising to the clergy, nobles, and people a full redress of the grievances of the last reign, so easily reconciled all orders of men to the usurp- ation that no attempt was made to oppose it; and even Robert, earl of Gloucester, the natural brother and principal counsellor of Matilda, found it necessary to yield for a season to the general example, and swear allegiance to Stephen.* Stephen. \u2014 a.d. 1135-1154 If there were any man whom Henry, having treated with unwonted kindness \u00a9 and generosity, might imagine that he had attached to the interests of his daughter by every tie of gratitude and honour, it was his sister's son, Stephen, the third whom she had born to the earl of Blois. As both he and a fourth son, Henry, an ecclesiastic, were without patrimony, the king had charged himself with their fortunes: the latter he raised to the see of Winchester; but on Stephen he lavished every mark of parental fondness. For he not only gave him the earldom of Moretoil in Normandy, but by subsequently obtaining for him the hand of Matilda, daughter and heiress of Eustace, count of Boulogne, besides the vast domains conferred by the Conqueror on that lord in England, he secured his succession to the title and territories of the count's more princely French fief. The character of Stephen, having gained the affection, might seem to justify the confi dence with which the king regarded him as the future champion of his daughter's cause. He was by nature active and valor ous, kind and generous, courteous and mer ciful ; qualities which, besides the popular favour, won him the hearts of his friends, and were freely acknowledged even by his enemies.* But in the most trying hour of his life the ambition of the earl of Boulogne proved too strong for his better feelings; and thus impelled, in shameless disregard of every oath and obligation, he was guilty of the blackest ingratitude to his benefactor, by usurping the inheritance of his daughter. He had not a shadow of just pretension to the throne : for if the claims of Matilda and her infant sons were to be set aside by the repugnance of the nobles to a female suc cession or a minority, a prior title of here ditary descent from the Conqueror was vested even in his own elder brother, Meanwhile the progress of affairs in the continental dominions of the late king pro mised those possessions also to the usurper of his English throne.

The count of Anjou and his vassals were ignominiously expelled; and the Norman barons were on the point of offering their ducal crown to Theobald, count of Blois, elder brother of Stephen, when an oppor tune message from the latter prince deter mined them to maintain their connection with England by tendering their fealty to himself. Stephen, in order to sustain his sovereignty, despatched a large force of Flemish mercenaries into the duchy under William of Ipres ; and Count Geoffrey with his Anjevins, on the other hand, frequently renewed his invasions in support of his wife's title. The whole country, therefore, was for some years cruelly ravaged by foreign partisans who, on both sides, were equally odious to the natives. The Norman barons, on pretence of supporting either cause, aimed only at making themselves independent of all control, and by their private wars aggra vated and prolonged the public wretched ness; but between the two rivals for the sovereignty the advantage lay almost wholly with Stephen, who had not only obtained pessession of the principal places in the duchy, but had prevailed on the French king formally to grant him its investiture.* Nor were repeated diversions which Ma tilda prevailed upon her maternal uncle, David, king of Scotland, to make in her behalf on the English borders, more suc cessful than the arms of her adherents in Normandy. The first of these attempts, a few months after the seizure of the crown by Stephen, produced only some indecisive hostilities, and was closed by a peace. But two years later, prompted either by regard to oaths which he had formerly sworn to Henry I. to support the succession of his daughter, or by resentment at the failure of Stephen to invest him with the earldom of Northumberland promised at the late paci fication, David undertook a new and more formidable invasion of England ; and over running the northern counties with a great army of his barbarian Scots, he was unable to restrain them from the commission of the most horrible cruelties. Churches, monas teries, and whole villages were subjected to a common conflagration, and their inhabit ants to promiscuous slaughter. At length the barons and people of Yorkshire, nerved by despair, and animated by the religious exhortations of their venerable metropolitan, took post near Northallerton, in close, deep, and immovable array around a lofty mast, surmounted by a silver crucifix, which was fixed in the body of a waggon, and gave a lasting name to the \" Battle of the Stand ard\" (1138).* Here the English awaited an assault with so much resolution, and in such impenetrable order, that the invaders were defeated with tremendous slaughter ; and the king of Scots and his son, with the remains of his army, not more than half of whose numbers escaped from the flight and the pursuit, rallied not until they reached the border city of Carlisle. Early in the following year the horrors of this northern war were terminated by a second peace, of which, notwithstanding the late victory, the terms were rather favourable than otherwise to the king of Scotland ; but the attention of Stephen was now engrossed by the domestic troubles of his government; and the cala mities of a civil war were already impending over his kingdom, f The causes of the dreadful miseries which followed him must be sought, partly in a * This standard with its carriage closely resembled the Carroccio, or Sacred Battle car, so often mentioned in the wars of the Lombard cities. On the mast, below the crucifix, waved the banners, as they are described, of several saints; of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, St. John of Beverley, and St. Wilfrid of Ripon; and from the carriage itself, the bishop of Orkney, as officiating for the aged metropolitan, Thurstan of York, whose infirmities prevented his presence, pronounced an absolution and blessing upon the embattled host.

But it has been conjectured with sufficient proba bility that Stephen had provoked the enmity of that powerful order, by disappointing the expectations of an increase to their already enormous privileges, which had induced them originally to support his usurpation. However this may have been, we find that the king, on the occasion of an assembly of prelates and barons, held at Oxford in the same year in which the battle of the Stand ard was fought, outraged the whole eccle siastical body by seizing the persons of the bishops of Sarum and Lincoln, upon a charge of breaking the king's peace by the excitement of a tumult in his court. At the same time the bishop of Ely escaped only by flight from similar violence ; and an immediate surrender of the fortresses of the captive prelates \u2014 for, like the lay barons, even these ecclesiastical lords now possessed fortified castles \u2014 was demanded and obtained by the king as the price of their lives and liberty. Amidst the indignation with which these proceedings were received by the clergy, the bishop of Winchester, who had lately been invested with the dignity of papal legate, probably found himself placed in a situation of extreme embarrassment between his relationship to the king and a common interest and sympathy with his pro fessional brethren. But it is manifest that his attachment to his order was stronger than the ties of blood: for, in his legatine capacity, he summoned his brother before a synod of bishops, to answer for his conduct and make restitution of the church property which he had seized; and the king, although he refused to give up the castles, which he contended that it was unlawful for ecclesi- Stephen had soon sufficient reason to repent the imprudent violence with which he had drawn upon himself the hostility of the church. Within a month after the dis solution of the synod, the Empress Matilda (for she still bore that title), whether invited by the prelates or induced by knowledge of their disaffection to her rival, landed in England with a slender train of no more than one hundred and forty knights ; but her enterprise was supported by the pre sence of her brother, the earl of Gloucester, and encouraged by the promised aid of numerous partisans. f Her arrival was the signal for the immediate commencement of civil war in every part of the kingdom ; and as the strength or weakness of the contend ing parties was very equally balanced, the whole country was for several years exposed to frightful devastation from both factions, without any decisive result. While the rightful pretensions of Matilda were now zealously supported by the clergy, by the stout earl of Gloucester, and by all the influ ence which he could command among the nobles ; the cause of the usurper was upheld by numerous partisans who had enjoyed, or who expected, his lavish bounty; by the citizens of London, with whom he was per- * Orderic.

The empress on her landing repaired to the castle of Arandel, the residence of her mother-in-law Adelais, queen-dowager of Henry I., who was now married to the earl of Sussex. Stephen soon \"appeared before the fortress with a superior force ; and Adelais, dread ing a siege, demanded free permission for Matilda to quit the castle and join her brother, the earl of Gloucester, in the west, which Stephen immediately granted ; for, adds Malmsbury, no true knight could in courtesy do less. This strange piece of gallantry, however, is rather referred by the anonymous biographer of Stephen to an ill-judged expectation that, by allowing the empress to withdraw, he should be enabled to cut off her communications with her partisans in the centre of the kingdom, and confine her efforts within a distant pro vince.

But the great barons in general, retiring to their castles, kept aloof from the contest, and either affected a complete independence and neutrality between the competitors for the sovereignty, or embraced either cause only for the unrestrained indulgence of their pri vate feuds, and their greediness for oppres sion and rapine. It would redound little to the pleasure or the instruction of the reader to rescue from oblivion the barbarous and desultory circumstances of a warfare, which was fertile only in crimes. But in the third year of the contest a signal advantage was gained by Matdda, which, but for her own misconduct, might have placed her in secure possession of the throne. While engaged in the siege of the castle of Lincoln, the king's forces were attacked and totally de feated by her army under the earl of Glou cester ; and Stephen himself, after performing prodigies of personal valour, was wounded and made prisoner. He was conveyed in custody to Bristol, and soon after ignomin iously thrown into a dungeon and loaded with chains.* repaired to London to receive the crown ; * and her triumph seemed completed by the favourable reception with which she was welcomed by the citizens of the capital, who already formed a body of considerable power in the state, and had hitherto shown them selves the strenuous partisans of Stephen.! But when her fortunes had thus attained the ascendant, they were suddenly humbled by her arrogant and vindictive temper. She offended the bishop-legate of Winchester by contemptuously refusing to accept Stephen's formal surrender of the crown upon condi tion that his Norman earldom and English domains should be secured to his son. And with equal imprudence, instead of endeav ouring to conciliate the affections of the citizens of London, she not only insolently rejected their suit for the restoration of the privileges which they had enjoyed under the Confessor, but imposed a heavy tax upon them as a punishment for their previous ad herence to the cause of the usurper. The bishop of Winchester immediately retired in disgust from her court; but the citizens meditated a quicker vengeance ; and ani mated by the opportune appearance of a body of horse, which Stephen's queen had caused to approach the capital, they so unex pectedly rose in arms, that the empress only escaped captivity by a precipitate flight to Oxford. The bishop of Winchester now once more espoused his brother's party ; and the empress assembling her principal ad herents with their forces, attended by her brother, the earl of Gloucester, and her uncle, David, king of Scotland, proceeded from Oxford to surprise the bishop-legate in his own city. But that prelate escaped in time to join Stephen's queen, who, at the head of the Londoners, and reinforced by other partisans of her husband, was advancing to his aid. The empress and her friends were soon hemmed in on every side; and after This misfortune of Stephen, as might be expected, overwhelmed his own party with despair, and induced most of the barons who had hitherto observed a suspicious neu trality to offer their allegiance to his victo rious rival. The faithful queen of Stephen (who was also named Matilda) alone remained in arms in Kent, rather with the view of obtaining better terms for her husband, than with any serious hope of prolonging the contest; but the victors, despising the efforts of an adversary apparently so feeble, con ducted the empress to Winchester, where, after some negotiations, she was openly acknowledged as queen by the bishop-legate, the primate, and a synod of the episcopal and dignified clergy.

The effort was only so far suc cessful that the gallant earl of Gloucester covered the flight of his sister by sacrificing himself with a chosen body of nobles and knights to her safety. She escaped, while her whole escort, after bravely sustaining the assaults of her pursuers, were either slain, captured, or dispersed. The Scottish king himself was thrice taken, and as often extricated himself from the hands of the victors; but Robert of Gloucester was less fortunate, and with many other nobles remained a prisoner.* she had lost the firmest support of her cause. Meanwhile, the diversion produced by her having carried the war into England had not been without benefit to her rights over Normandy. For the usurper being too much occupied by the defence of his Eng lish crown to support his Norman adherents, her husband Geoffrey had succeeded in reducing that duchy to obedience ; and thence Stephen, after a brief season of repose which succeeded the departure of the empress, soon found himself assailed by a more youthful and formidable opponent.* This was Henry Plantagenet, eldest son of the empress, who had already, when a boy, been conducted into England by his uncle the earl of Gloucester, and remained under his warlike tuition until the death of that nobleman. Subsequently he had re visited the island, and received his knightly investiture at Carlisle from another uncle, David, king of Scotland. As he approached the age of manhood, the young prince dis played talents and energies of the highest order. By the death of his father he had now succeeded to the earldom of Anjou; in the name of his mother he held the government of Normandy ; and by his unscrupulous union with Eleanor, the re pudiated queen of Louis VII. of France, he acquired possession of the duchy of Aquitaine, her inheritance. Attracted by the rising fortunes of this young prince, the enemies of Stephen, who, unwarned by adversity, had imprudently embroiled him self anew with his clergy and barons, invited him again into England; and his landing produced an immediate renewal of the civil wars. But when the armies of the hostile factions drew out against each other to dis pute the passage of the Thames at Walling ford, many of the principal barons on both sides suddenly showed their weariness of the long disorders which had afflicted the realm. Agreeing in this feeling, they compelled the rival princes to conclude a solemn treaty, by which Stephen, on re ceiving the allegiance of Henry for his own The earl, however, had been so com pletely the soul of every enterprise, that his sister was glad to purchase his release by that of Stephen ; and this exchange restored both parties very nearly to the same position in which they had been placed before the battle of Lincoln. It is useless to pursue further the shifting vicissitudes of a struggle from which Matilda, after passing through many wild adventures, f was at last induced or compelled by weariness of the struggle or despair of the result, to retire into Nor mandy. But she did not yield until a desultory and indecisive warfare of six years since the release of Stephen had tried and exhausted her endurance and hopes; and until, by the death of her brave brother, * The captive earl of Gloucester was treated with all the consideration due to his valiant and faithful character; and the conduct of Stephen's queen in this respect formed a generous contrast to that of the opposite party towards her unfortunate husband. The unshaken and devoted attach ment of the earl to the cause of his sister, and of the queen to that of her consort, render these two by far the most, perhaps the only, interesting personages in the perplexed and troubled drama of their times. t Many of the incidents presented by this contest in com mon with the desultory vicissitudes of every partisan warfare, are not without romantic interest, although too confused and inconsequential to be worthy of historical record. On one occasion, after enduring a winter's siege in Oxford, tbe empress effected her escape by night, while the ground was covered with snow, by dressing herself, and three knights her attend ants, in white. After passing by this stratagem unobserved through the enemy's beleaguer, she was obliged to cross the Thames over the ice on foot. Gesta Stephani, p. 959. Another tale told by the continuator of Florence of Worcester (p. 677), of her being carried in a hearse from Devizes to Gloucester after her flight from Winchester, should probably be rejected, as tacitly contradicted by the silence of other con temporary authorities of better credit.

The ambition of Eustace, the king's eldest son, whom the archbishop of Canterbury, although solicited by Stephen, had already refused to crown as his heir, presented the only obstacle to a settlement: but this was shortly removed by the opportune death of the young prince, who, withdrawing from the court in furious indignation on \u00a9 the first proposal of the treaty, suddenly expired in a paroxysm of phrensy. The duke of Normandy, after accompanying the king in an amicable progress through the principal cities of the realm, returned to Normandy; and only a few months after wards Stephen peaceably ended his dis tracted reign and troubled existences 154).* forth to starve. A whole day's journey might the traveller ride, and not find a man left in a town, nor a land in tillage.* It has been well observed, that by this lan guage of general horror the universal misery of England is better expressed than would be possible by examples : f but some signal instances of wanton devastation may still be selected from the long catalogue' of ruin which was filled by the wickedness of both factions. During the siege which the \u00a9 \u00a9 empress sustained in the castle of Winches ter, the combatants on either side fired and plundered the city; and the extent of the conflagration in that ancient capital of Wessex may be estimated by the fact that it consumed no fewer than forty churches and two monasteries.]: Worcester shared nearly a similar fate ; and Nottingham, which had already become populous and wealthy for that age, was the scene of a more horrid catastrophe: for the greater number of its inhabitants perished in the flames. Amidst these disorders even churches and religious houses, of which the sanctity was wont to claim the awe and respect of a Christian knighthood, and whose walls had often been the last refuge of the oppressed and the defenceless, and afforded a secure asylum to female inno cence and helpless age, were unscrupulously desecrated and remorselessly defiled with nameless atrocities. The horrors inflicted on the kingdom by his criminal and fatal ambition cannot be more forcibly described than in the simple and coincident language of two contem- \u00a9 o porary chroniclers ; and the best personal qualities of a nature neither ungenerous nor cruel in itself, will poorly extenuate the guilt which his usurpation engendered. In the days of this king, say these faithful witnesses, all was feud and disorder and wickedness. Strong lords, who heeded not the troth which they had sworn to him, built castles and held them against him, filling these with evil and devilish men, by whose hands they seized and cruelly oppressed the poor folks of the land, forcing them to grievous labours; shutting up in dungeons full of noisome reptiles such as had gold or silver; and wringing out their spoils with strange and sundry torments. Some hanged they by the feet in deadly smoke, some by the hair and the thumbs; some upon hot iron; of some crushed they the bodies in boxes of stone, or twisted knotted cords round their temples, or en circled their necks with spiked collars. Very many they vexed to death with hunger and thirst. And so it ever grew worse for all the years that Stephen was king. The towns were burned with fire, the lands left waste, the poor folks driven Two circumstances may chiefly be re marked as the causes of these frightful disorders: the license of erecting strong holds to secure an impunity for their crimes, which barons of every degree assumed at the commencement of Stephen's usurpation ; and the employment, not only by the king but by his feudal supporters and opponents, of bodies of Flemish mercenaries, or Bra baneons as they were commonly called, from the province in which they were most numerously recruited. The number of new castles alone, which these banditti were \u00bb Chron. Sax. pp 238, 239. Gesta Stephani. p 961. f Macintosh (Hist, of England), vol. i. p. 135.

But, indeed, no dread of in curring the guilt of sacrilege, one of the few crimes which the tyrants and spoilers of the Middle Ages usually shuddered to perpetrate, any longer restrained the con tending parties. Whether the objects of greedy rapacity, or more cruel passions, were contained within the walls of lay or ecclesiastical edifices, the Brabancons sacked, burned, murdered, and violated, with the same devilish ferocity, and the same impious scorn of all compunctious feeling. Nor were such crimes confined to these wretches : the feudal nobles, who sought their services, imitated their lives; and it is the indig nant reproach of the chronicler, that these Christian knights made a shameless boast of atrocities at which their pagan forefathers might have blushed.* by the most vigorous measures for the restoration of order. He immediately issued a proclamation commanding the foreign mercenaries, who had been the scourge and terror of the people, to quit the country by an appointed day under pain of death. He reclaimed the possession of all the royal castles and demesnes which the powerful partisans, either of his mother or of the usurper, had extorted as the price of their wavering allegiance ; and he insisted on the demolition of the numerous private fortresses which the adherents of both factions, amidst the public confusion, had illegally erected. These demands were not of a nature to receive a voluntary compliance : but neither were they made until Henry had prepared to enforce them by the assemblage of a formidable army; and either awed by this display of the royal power, or chastised by its exertion, each of the great barons, who had so long reigned the tyrant of his pro- vince, was successively compelled to sub- mission or surrender. Royal garrisons were placed in all the castles which had originally belonged to the crown; and those which Henry, bishop of Winchester, Stephen's brother, as well as many lay barons, had constructed, were everywhere razed to the earth. At the same time an equitable administration of the laws was firmly estab lished and rigidly observed ; and under these salutary reforms the kingdom soon began to recover from the calamities by which it had been oppressed. An insurrection of the Welsh, who had often ravaged the English marches with impunity during the life of Stephen, alone disturbed the national tranquillity. But although the royal arms were not eminently triumphant against that restless and inaccessible people, their depre dations were severely chastised; and the war was successfully concluded by the sub mission of their princes, who were reduced to swear allegiance to Henry, and to leave hostages in his hands for their fealty.* While Henry had thus re-established the Henry II. \u2014 a.d. 1154-1189. The death of Stephen, and the energetic character of the youthful duke of Normandy, inspired the English with eager hopes of deliverance from the long and frightful anarchy with which the misrule of the usurper had afflicted the kingdom ; and the accession of Henry Plantagenet to the throne was welcomed with the universal joy of the nation. Nor were their expectations disap pointed. On his arrival from Normandy, after celebrating his coronation, and securing the popular affection by a renewal of the charter which his grandsire had granted and violated, the young king proceeded to signalize the commencement of his reign * Gesta Stephani, pp. 961-970, &c.

Including Brittany, always an arriere-fief of his Norman duchy, and of which he found occasion to obtain a more effectual posses sion, he was master either by inheritance or by marriage of all western France, in uninterrupted extent from the British Chan nel to the Pyrenees, and from the Atlantic coast to the confines of Picardy, the Orlean nois, and Toulouse. These great possessions, which far surpassed in space and value the whole territory immediately subject to the French king, rendered Henry, though nomi nally the vassal of Louis VII., in reality his political superior; and the hereditary office of great seneschal of France, which the English monarch held by descent from his paternal grandfather, Foulques V. of Anjou, as it strangely intrusted to his administra tion the highest judicial prerogatives of the crown, without permitting an appeal to the sovereign himself, completed his total inde pendence of the nominal lord paramount. It is not, therefore, surprising that, as we have formerly observed, the aggrandize ment thus attained by a vassal, and in a great degree at his own expense by marriage with his repudiated queen, filled Louis VII. with alarm and jealousy; and these feelings, continually irritated by the ambitious pro jects of Henry, occasioned throughout the reign of both princes a long series of quickly rekindling though desultory contests. The first of these arose, as we have already noticed, from the claims which Henry laid to the county of Toulouse in right of his wife, whose father had once held it by marriage, but mortgaged it to Raymond, count of St. Gilles. The French king himself, before his divorce from Eleanor of Aquitaine, had advanced the same preten sions on her behalf: but this did not now prevent him from extending that protection to Raymond through which the design of Henry was finally frustrated. We have seen that the pacification which closed this war was almost immediately broken by the dishonourable fraud through which Henry obtained possession of the Vexin as the promised dower of the infant Princess Margaret of France, the betrothed bride of his son, Henry Courtmantel: but though Louis consented to smother for a season the indignation which he felt at having been overreached in this affair, and allowed him self, by the papal mediation, to be again reconciled with his more artful and un scrupulous adversary, he subsequently found, and eagerly seized, a more promising oppor tunity of securing vengeance. This was afforded by the famous quarrel which took place between Henry and the primate, Thomas a Becket.* The conspicuous part acted by that extra ordinary person in the political and religious affairs of the reign before us, claims some particular notice of his personal history and character. Thomas a Becket was the son of a London citizen, of the native Saxon race ; f and his fortunes present this, among other remarkable singularities, that the in dividual who so long defied the power and embittered the existence of his sovereign was the first Englishman who, since the Con quest, had been permitted to attain any civil or ecclesiastical dignity. Becket was bred to the church ; and an early display of the abilities by which he was subsequently dis tinguished recommended him to the notice of Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury. Through the favour of that primate he received some preferment, and was enabled to travel to Italy for the purpose of improv ing his knowledge of the civil and canon law, which he studied under the famous Gratian at Bologna, the great seat of those * Hoveden, p. 492. Gul. Neubrig. lib. ii. pp. 5-24. f A curious and romantic tale has been sometimes copied from a chronicler (John of Brompton), who lived scarcely within two centuries of the event, ascribing the birth of Becket to his father's marriage with a noble Saracen damsel, who had become acquainted with, and loved him, in the Holy Land, and found her way to rejoin him, after many marvellous and touching adventures, in London. But the story, of which all the details are highly improbable, was evidently unknown to the biographer of Becket, or to any other extant writers nearer to his times than Brompton, and may therefore be dismissed as utterly unworthy of credit, and probably without a vestige of authenticity."], [190, "152 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 11G1. branches of learning. On his return, his patron, who found such acquirements useful in transacting the affairs of his church, rewarded his services by obtaining for him the rich archdeaconry of Canterbury, and introduced him to the special notice of the king.* \u00a9 tion for martial conduct and prowess than for religious propriety.* While Becket publicly exhibited this unseemly spectacle of a dissipated, worldly, and militant ecclesiastic, it is not wonderful that Henry, although himself a prince of great sagacity, should have fatally mistaken the real character of the man, and expected to find, in the able and unscrupulous minis- ter, a ready instrument for the design which he had entertained from the beginning of his reign of repressing the multiplied en- croachments of the church upon the royal authority. The debt of personal gratitude which he owed to Archbishop Theobald induced him to suspend the execution of his project during the life of that prelate: but when the death of Theobald released him from his obligations, he resolved to forbear no longer ; and to insure the success of his intended measures, it seemed only necessary to elevate his compliant favourite and chancellor to the vacant primacy. It is recorded to the honour, and, if true, it forms some extenuation for the subsequent conduct of Becket, that when the king announced his intended promotion, he at first, with a jocular allusion to his luxurious and unclerical dress, observed that there was little in that garb to indicate an archbishop The share of the primate in securing the succession of Henry gave weight to this recommendation ; and the rise of Becket was thenceforth assured. Attracted both by his talents for business and his agreeable manners, which at that period of his life were little restrained within the bounds of professional decorum, the king freely admitted him both into the confidence of his serious and the familiarity of his lighter hours. The royal favourite was appointed chancellor; received the wardenship of the Tower of London and other lucrative offices ; and was intrusted with the principal adminis- tration of all his master's dominions, both insular and continental. These dignities he supported with a magnificence more regal than clerical; maintained a sumptuous establishment and an immense retinue ; dis- pensed a splendid hospitality, and lived on the easiest and most intimate terms with a sovereign who shared his pleasures too heartily to feel jealous of the style which they affected. The political abilities of the minister were devoted to the service of his master with as much success and with as little scruple as his convivial accomplish- ments ; and it was by the adroitness of Becket, in an embassy to the French king, that Louis was induced to conclude that affiance of his infant daughter to the son of Henry which subsequently cost him the loss of the Vexin. In the hostilities between the two monarchs, Becket appeared in the new character of a warrior; and at the head of a large body of knights and gens oVarmerie, whom he levied and maintained at his own expense, the archdeacon of Canterbury, though the example was less uncommon than shameful among churchmen of that age, marched and fought with more reputa- * Stephan, pp. 10-21. Several casual notices, not with out interest in their way, of the manners of the times may be gleaned from this narrative of Filz-Stephen, the secretary and biographer of Becket. It was an instance of the sumptuous hospitality of the chancellor that his apartments were daily strewn with fresh rushes or hay, lest his guests, who were usually more numerous than could be accommodated with seats at his table, should dirty their clothes as they sat on the floor! Yet the costliness of his furniture, the luxury of his banquets, and the general splendour of his state, were the theme of contemporary wonder and admiration. When he went on an embassy from his master to the French king, he travelled with a train which astonished all beholders by its magnificence. He was preceded, on his entrance to every considerable town, by an incredible number of choristers or singing boys, who struck up some triumphant chant. These were followed by several wains laden with bis plate, ward robe, and bedding, and the utensils of his chapel and kitchen ; not forgetting stores of ale to be distributed to the populace. Sumpter horses with led chargers, hounds, falcons, and mon keys, also figured in the procession, with a crowd of knights, esquires, and clerks ; and last of all rode the chancellor him self, encircled by the principal members and attendants of his household. Henry was probably flattered by this imposing display of pomp in his minister: for it was a common remark of the people in the French provinces through which the em bassy passed, that he must needs be a mighty monarch whose very servant was wont to maintain so royal a pageantry. * Stephin. pp 1-9."], [191, "A.D. 1161.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 153 elect: but finding his master serious in his purpose, he as earnestly conjured Henry not to force him into the only situation in which he might find his continued services to his benefactor incompatible with higher duties. But the king would hear of no scruples, and Becket became archbishop of Canterbury.* elevation, and its necessity for his further aggrandizement, were too palpable not to betray the workings of a worldly and ambi tious temper. The ambition of Becket, indeed, had nothing in it either sordid or vulgar. He was contented to forego the enjoyment of wealth, luxury, courtly favour and homage, and even of political office and power: but it was only that he might ex change such toys of commonplace passion for that unbounded spiritual ascendancy over the public opinion of his times, to desire which is most congenial to the loftiest natures. He surrendered, indeed, his influ ence over the affections of his sovereign, and the temporal government of a kingdom, but he aspired to gain. the veneration of a devout people, the absolute rule of a triumphant church, and the universal admiration of the ecclesiastical order throughout Europe, an order which engrossed all the learning and intellectual superiority of its age. From that hour the new primate assumed a deportment in every respect the most op posite from the whole tenour of his former life. He immediately changed the pomp of secular state and luxurious magnificence for a yet prouder ostentation of humility and self-denial ; he discarded his splendid retinue of noble and knightly dependants, his costly habiliments, his sumptuous fare, and his worldly amusements ; he rejected the com mon attendance prescribed by his dignity, wore sackcloth next his skin, used only the most abstemious diet, inflicted on his body the severest penances which the fanaticism of his age mistook for the means of sanctifi cation, and diverted the prodigal expenditure of his recent hospitalities to as lavish a dis tribution of alms and charitable uses. His time was entirely occupied between devo tional exercises and ecclesiastical duties ; and his desire thenceforth to abstract his mind wholly from mere temporal business was formally declared in the resignation of his office of chancellor.f Much discussion has been wasted by historians on the motives which produced this surprising change of conduct, for the subject has usually been converted into a party question between the champions and opponents of the Church of Rome. But when viewed apart both from religious prejudice and the worse affectation of an overstrained charity of judgment, a dispassionate survey of the preceding life and subsequent behaviour of Becket will supply to the common sense of mankind only one conclusion. The pious conversion of the new archbishop was too sudden to be sincere : its exact coincidence with his The first circumstances which hastened an open quarrel between the king and the new primate have been variously related: but it would be to little purpose to inquire the ostensible cause of a rupture which the position and views of both parties rendered inevitable. The sudden and ostentatious change in the deportment of Becket was sufficient to excite the suspicion and alarm of Henry ; and some acts of covert hostility on either side completed the alienation of feeling between the sovereign and his late favourite. But the great and final subject of controversy was the extent of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The scandalous consequences of the exemption claimed by the clergy from trial before any secular tribunals furnished the king with a fair pica for entering on his long-cherished design of humbling their order. As the ecclesiastical courts, while they pretended to the sole cognizance of offences committed by clerks, were not vested with the power of inflicting capital or other sufficient punishments, their pro tection amounted to an impunity for the most enormous crimes. More than a hun dred murders, it is said, had thus been * This tale of the scruples of Becket, however, seems to rest only on his own assertion. St. Thomas, in Hist.

This reasonable proposal was immediately resisted by Becket; and the king, resolved at once to bring the whole question of ecclesiastical usurpation to an issue, formally demanded of the primate and his bishops whether they were willing to observe the ancient laws and customs of the kingdom. They at first endeavoured to evade the demand by qualifying their reply with a reservation in favour of the privileges of their order ; nor was it until the just anger of the king at this artifice had shown itself with so great violence as to terrify the bishops, that the bolder primate was induced by their entreaties to withdraw a saving clause which had been designed to nullify the apparent assent. f derivable from the old Saxon laws, had received a full confirmation, however ne glected in more recent practice, by the charter of his grandfather. These proposi tions the lay barons, who appear to have sided on this occasion wholly with the king, at once cheerfully ratified; and the clergy, though not without some murmurs, being overawed by the unanimity of the nobles, attempted no resistance, and subscribed to sixteen articles, which became deservedly memorable under the name of the \"Constitu tions of Clarendon.\" By the most important of these articles it was enacted, that all clerks accused of crimes should, in the first instance, come before the king's courts, and if there convicted should forfeit the protection of the church; that in each suit to which a clerk was a party, it should be left to the royal justices to determine whether the matter properly fell under civil or ecclesias tical jurisdiction ; that no priest should quit the realm nor carry an appeal from any spiritual tribunal beyond the archbishop's court, without the royal permission ; that none of the king's tenants in capite should be excommunicated without his consent ; that the custody and revenues of vacant dignities in the church should be vested in the king; that elections to such vacancies should be made on his writ and with his assent only, by the principal clergy of the see, or abbey, if of royal foundation ; that the individual elected should take the oath of fealty and do homage to the king as his liege lord; and that all clerks holding im mediately of the crown should be subject to the same suit and service in his courts as his lay tenants.* But Henry, not choosing to rest the security of his prerogative even upon an unconditional concession thus reluctantly yielded, was now determined both to define the ancient usages of the kingdom, and to reduce the growth of ecclesiastical preten sions within surer limits, by obtaining the formal sanction of national assent and enact ment. For this purpose he summoned one of those great councils of the realm, com posed of all its barons and prelates, which in that age were only convened on the most solemn occasions, and which, in the absence of any more direct form of public represen tation, were reasonably held to be invested with the supreme legislative authority of the nation. In this assembly, which met at Clarendon, the king proposed a series of resolutions declaratory of those customs applicable to ecclesiastical affairs, which, as It was not without the greatest reluctance that Becket had been persuaded or com pelled to give his assent to the Constitutions of Clarendon. But he had no sooner retired from the assembly than he openly con demned his own compliance; performed self-imposed penances for his weakness; suspended himself from the exercise of the * Neubrig. lib. ii. p. 1 6. t Stephan, pp. 26-32.

HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 155 archiepiscopal office; and applied to the pope, both to withhold his ratification from the articles, and to grant him absolution for his own share in their enactment. The reigning pontiff, Alexander III., doubtless had the sagacity to view the whole trans action as an important crisis in the great struggle of civil and ecclesiastical power; and when solicited by Henry to confirm the Constitutions, he at once boldly espoused the cause of the English primate, and rejected the most obnoxious of the articles. This decisive measure was the less expected by Henry, as he had warmly supported the pretensions of Alexander against the Anti pope Victor; and it accordingly filled hin with the greatest perplexity and indignation. But his chief resentment was directed against \u00a9 Becket, whom he not unnaturally regarded as an ungrateful rebel to his former favour and present authority, and as the instigator of the papal refusal. tiality of the royal tribunals resistance was ineffectual ; and it then became evident that flight was his only resource. Retiring secretly from the court, before which he had been summoned at Northampton, he suc ceeded in reaching the coast in safety; and crossing the Channel to Flanders, proceeded first to visit the king of France, and after wards the pope, who was then residing at Sens. By both these potentates, from different motives, he was received with the utmost distinction: in one case, as an ally who might be useful in the game of political hostility; in the other, as a devoted champion to the cause of ecclesiastical supremacy.* The favourable reception thus accorded to his enemy was calculated to excite the most serious apprehensions in the mind of Henry, who was not ignorant of the rankling jealousy of the French king, and of the facility with which the turbulent and dis affected vassals of his Continental states in particular, might be absolved and seduced from their allegiance. But he met the danger with firmness and ability; and while he laboured to conciliate the pontiff, took the most effectual precautions for defending his dominions, and for preventing the intro duction of any spiritual decrees into England, either from the pope or the primate. At the same time, he pursued the latter with unrelenting hostility: confiscated not only the revenues of his see, but the property of his friends; expelled all those attached to him from the kingdom to share his exile; and even compelled the French Benedictines to refuse him a continued asylum in their abbey of Pontigny, by the threat of seizing all the rich possessions of their order in England. But the proud spirit of Becket mounted only the higher under these per secutions; and it may be believed that, brooding in seclusion over his sufferings, his heated imagination was gradually in flamed into fanatical enthusiasm, which really misled him to confound his cause with These irritated feelings hurried him into many acts of unjustifiable violence. Hitherto he had appeared to assert no more than those reasonable prerogatives of his crown which were necessary for the due execution of the laws; but he now commenced a course of petty persecution against the property of the archbishop, which was equally iniquitous in itself and unworthy of his own honour. He deprived Becket of estates which he had formerly bestowed upon him; harassed him with vexatious suits in the royal courts for the recovery of fictitious debts, wdiich it was pretended that he had incurred in his chancellorship; and employed every legal chicanery for his oppression and ruin. The primate met these attacks with a dignified firmness, which placed his conduct in a striking and advantageous contrast to the meanness of the royal revenge. Some of the king's unjust demands he satisfied, with a lofty declaration that money should never form a subject of contention between his sovereign and himself: to others he demurred only when their enormous amount flagrantly exposed their design, and exceeded all possibility of payment. Against the par- \u00ab Stephan, pp. 36-46. Gervas. pp. 1389-1398. Epistol\u0153 St. Thom\u00e6, lib. ii. 5-33, &c."], [194, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1170-1171. 156 that of religion and heaven. Thus exalted by pride and passion, and emboldened by the papal support, he proceeded solemnly to excommunicate all his personal enemies, and all who should maintain the Constitutions of Clarendon ; he laid the whole of the eccle siastical province of Canterbury, which em braced the greater part of England, under an interdict; and while his sovereign alone was still excepted from his anathemas, Henry was admonished that even this forbearance might have its term.* qualification, or his acuteness foresaw the insecurity.* At length, however, the uneasiness of Henry on the one hand, and probably the discovery of Becket, on the other, that his protectors, the king of France and the pope, were becoming equally weary of his quarrel, disposed both parties to an accommodation. But when the articles of a mutual compro mise had been adjusted, the reconciliation was still for some time delayed, because Henry objected to afford a pledge of his sin cerity by giving the primate the customary kiss of peace. This he obstinately withheld on the excuse of a vow by which he had rashly bound himself in his anger; and the growth of Becket's distrust was natur ally measured by the pertinacity of Henry's refusal. Such conduct in the king has been regarded as an evidence of dissimulation by some writers, who have overlooked the obvi ous conclusion that the very avowal of a scruple must defeat any purpose of duplicity; but the circumstance is worthy of remark only as a proof of the importance attached, by the gross superstition of the age, to a mere quibble of conscience. For if sincere, Henry was contented to break the spirit, as long as he adhered to the letter of his vow : if otherwise, it was believed that he might more safely break his moral faith and kingly honour than violate an oath of implacable resentment. But this difficulty, like the more material subjects of dispute, was finally waived. It was agreed tacitly to abandon all reference to the original grounds of the quarrel. No recognition of the Constitutions of Clarendon, or other sub mission, was required from Becket; and the primate, upon restoration to his archi episcopal office and revenues, promised to serve the king with all honour and faithful ness. Upon this compromise Becket returned to England, and took possession of his see.f The first measure of the primate on his landing is confessed, even by his advocates, But the vigour of the king's measures intimidated the English clergy from observ ing the interdict; and the more cautious temper of the pope prohibited Becket from proceeding to the last extremity. The danger to Henry of a revolt in his Continental states would have been less easily sur mounted, if the French king had been a prince of more skilful and energetic character. But although Louis was not averse from using every weapon to harass so obnoxious a rival, he wanted perseverance and talent to improve the occasion; and after some years of irritating but desultory hostility, Henry had the address to lure him into a peace by the offer of an advantageous family alliance. By this treaty the English mon arch agreed to cede Aquitaine fully to his second son Richard, in order that, espousing a daughter of Louis, the young prince should hold that great fief immediately from his father-in-law. Henry flattered Louis still more by proposing to make him the umpire of his quarrel with Becket; and several conferences were accordingly held upon the subject between the two monarchs and the exiled primate. On one of these occasions Henry, with the appearance at least of great moderation, declared that he would be satis fied if Becket would so behave towards him, as the holiest of the primate's predecessors had done to the meanest of his. But Becket insolently or prudently evaded a proffer, of which either his pride could ill digest the * Stephan, pp. 47-56. Gervas. pp. 1399-1408. Hove den, pp. 496-499. Epist.

These instruments having been originally intrusted to Becket, he no sooner arrived in England than he caused them to be publicly served upon the three prelates. It is stated that he was provoked to this insult by intelligence that the bishops, who knew that he carried the papers with him, designed to have seized them on his landing : but it is obvious that the use which he made of the papal censures was a violation of the spirit at least of the recent treaty. He shortly followed up this act of hostility by another, which still more plainly showed how little he was disposed to bury in oblivion the offences which had been committed against him by his enemies : for from the pulpit of his cathedral at Canterbury he proceeded publicly to excommunicate two of the king's servants, Ranulf and Robert de Broc, for oppressing his clergy by their master's command before the accommodation. When the first news of these outrageous aggressions reached Henry in Normandy, he resolved to encounter them by some legal proceedings against the primate: but reiterated complaints from his servants of the course which the vindictive prelate continued to pursue, at length provoked the passionate and fatal exclamation, that \" of all the cowards who ate his bread, there was none to rid him of a turbulent priest.\" | Moreville, and Reginald Fitz-Urse, who immediately binding themselves mutually by oath to avenge the king's quarrel, quitted the court in Normandy, and repaired to Canterbury. On their arrival in that city they rudely thrust themselves into the presence of the primate, and imperiously desired him to retract his late measures. The dauntless spirit of Becket rose with the very imminence of his personal danger; and he scarcely condescended to make any other reply than an indignant rebuke at the intrusion. Contenting themselves for the moment with menaces sufficiently intel ligible, the four knights withdrew; and their intended victim might either have securely guarded his person, or retired again from his see. But he magnanimously spurned every counsel of precaution, rejected the entreaties of his attendants to absent himself from vespers at the cathedral, and even refused to allow the doors of the church to be closed. He had scarcely entered the choir when the four knights, with twelve attendants all in complete armour, burst with drawn swords into the cathedral. To their loud demand, \" Where is the traitor? where is the archbishop?\" he calmly replied, \" Here am I, the archbishop, but no traitor.\" They told him he must instantly absolve the suspended bishops: he answered that he would not until they offered satisfaction. To one of the knights, whose patron he had formerly been, he observed, \" Thee I have rendered many services : what wouldst thou with me?\" The only reply was an attempt to grasp his person as a prisoner: when, in a momentary ebullition of passion at the insult, he seized the assailant by the gorget, and violently threw him off to some distance. Then, as suddenly recovering his self-pos session, he exclaimed that he was ready to die in the name of Christ and in defence of his church; and bowing his head, he un resistingly awaited the repeated blows of his assassins. The first stroke, already aimed at him, having been partially warded off by the only faithful attendant who had not fled, and whose arm it broke, had wounded This inconsiderate burst of fury was interpreted too literally by four knights of distinguished rank in the royal household, William de Tracy, Richard Brito, Hugh de * Gul.

His murderers desisted not until they had literally strewed the pavement with his brains.* (Dec. 29, 1171.) and deplored the unintentional encourage ment which he was sensible that his rash ebullition of anger had given to the assas sins; and he declared that, on such account only, as a self-imposed penance for the intem perate language which had tended to the fatal result, he would submit to purge him self by oath from the suspicion of having desired or designed the murder of the primate. The news of this sacrilegious and shock ing tragedy was received with universal execration. Among the clergy throughout Europe it excited all the indignation which was due to the fate of a man, who, having been the most distinguished champion of their order, was not unjustly deemed a martyr to their rights. By the superstitious laity, the scene of its perpetration and the sacred rank of the sufferer were regarded as fearful aggravations of a crime, the real atrocity of which, divested of these circumstances, would probably have produced far less sensation. The catastrophe altogether had the effect of incapacitating men's minds for any calm retrospect to the original merits of the quarrel between Henry and the murdered primate ; and the triumph of the church was completed in the one unmingled feeling of religious horror, which superseded all differ ences of opinion on the question of ecclesi astical encroachments. Henceforth, the king of England, instead of receiving the support of princes and nobles who were equally interested with himself in repressing the growth of ecclesiastical usurpation, might expect to find the strongest sympathies of mankind enlisted against a cause which his partisans had stained with so foul a murder. Henry was too quick-sighted not to perceive his danger, and too sagacious not to discover the only expedient for averting the storm which threatened to overwhelm him with destruction. He showed \u2014 and there appears no reason to doubt his sincerity \u2014 the deep est grief at the catastrophe ; and immediately despatched an embassy to the pope to assert his own innocence of any participation in the deed, and to deprecate the vengeance of the church against himself for the guilt of his servants. At the same time he confessed The pope, who saw that more was to be gained for the cause of ecclesiastical sup remacy by accepting his apologies than by pushing matters to extremity against him, improved the victory of the church to the greatest advantage, while he affected to use it with moderation. He therefore contented himself with excommunicating in general terms the murderers of Becket and all their abettors.* He received by his legates the solemn and public purgation of the king, from whom, as the price of reconciliation, oaths were at the same time extorted, that he would render due obedience to Alexander III. as the true pope; restore the posses sions of the see of Canterbury; abstain from enforcing any customs which had not been introduced before the reign, or from pre venting appeals to the holy see in ecclesi astical affairs ; and assume the Cross against the Infidels, if called upon, for three years. Upon these conditions absolution was finally granted to Henry; and a termination was put to a contest which had disturbed several years of his reign, and latterly foreboded the most disastrous consequences to his life and fortunes.! The clause by which he might seem to abandon the Constitutions of Clar endon was far too loosely worded to convey * The fate of the assassins of Becket was curious. They had at first fled to the castle of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, which belonged to Hugh de Moreville, one of their number; but the king, though he abstained from punishing by the secular law the zeal for his service which had fatally prompted them, was compelled, lest he should appear to countenance their crime, to abandon them to the judgment of the church. lo obtain relief from the papal sentence of excommunication they then made a penitential journey to Rome, whence the pope ordered them to proceed, in expiation of their guilt, on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem ; where some, or all, of them died, and were buried before the gate of the temple.

But it may be discerned that, amidst the in cessant vicissitudes of barbarian strife, a kind of paramount authority over the whole island was usually conceded to the most powerful of these provincial sovereigns; and this supremacy, at the epoch before us, was claimed by the O'Connors, kings of Connaught.* While his negotiations with the papal see were yet pending, and probably as a means of escaping from the embarrassing position in which he was personally placed by re maining in his continental dominions, Henry had undertaken an enterprise which was destined to prove the most remarkable of his reign. This was the conquest, or rather an assumption of the paramount sovereignty, of Ireland. It has been usual to introduce the details of that event by a long reference to the previous condition of the island: but the early history of the Irish, like that of every people in a similar state of utter barbarism, is obscure and fabulous; their political annals, if the term may be used, present nothing, so far as the genuineness of such records may be admitted, but a con fused series of savage wars and petty revolu tions ; and the establishment and fate of the Christian church in the island, which was very early founded \u2014 the only part of its primitive history which may claim any real interest \u2014 belongs to the ecclesiastical divi sion of our subject. It may therefore, in this place, suffice to say, that the Irish pqpple were evidently of the great Celtic race, with an admixture of colonies of North men, who had occupied parts of the sea coast, and built several places of trade; * that the state of society among the native tribes was pastoral, predatory, and warlike; and that they were governed by a number of petty chieftains, more or less subject to five kings of as many provinces \u2014 Connaught, Leinster, Ulster, and Tuamond and Des- Both the Conqueror of England and his sons appear to have entertained some projects for the subjugation of Ireland; from which probably they were only diverted by the distractions of their own unquiet reigns. But Henry II., even from the first year after his accession to the English crown, had evidently formed more serious intentions of prosecuting the same design ; for one of the earliest acts of his reign was to solicit and obtain from Pope Adrian III. a formal sanc tion for assuming the sovereignty of Ireland. It has been disputed whether this suit was in submission to the right already claimed by the pontiffs to dispose of the temporal kingdoms of the earth ; or merely intended to propitiate the papal support by the pros pect of extending the spiritual jurisdiction of the Romish see to an island, by the clergy of which the authority of the popes had been very faintly, if at all, recognized. But it was natural that Adrian should in any case con strue the application in the sense most agreeable to the papal pretensions; and he issued a bull accordingly, by which he granted the sovereignty of Ireland to Henry and his heirs. f The king, however, found his barons, whom he soon after assembled in a great council to deliberate on the enter prise, averse from its prosecution ;| and en gaging in other designs on the Continent, he forgot or suspended his first scheme for many years, until, while he was residing in Aquitaine in the height of his dispute with Becket, his ambition was tempted by the appearance at his court of one of the Irish princes. * O'Conor, Prolegom.

Henry, at the moment glad to evade the expected visit of the papal legates, hastily assembled a large fleet and numerous land force at Milford Haven : whence embark ing for Ireland, with the earl of Pembroke in his train, he landed at Waterford ; marched to Dublin ; received the submission of most of the native princes, who were overawed by the splendour of his royal progress and the imposing array of his troops ; and before his departure, though he added nothing to the conquests of Strongbow, extended his real or nominal supremacy over four out of the five provinces of the island.* A few years afterwards, having obtained a papal bull authorizing him to erect his conquests into a great fief of the English crown in favour of one of his sons, he bestowed it upon the youngest, Prince John, and sent him over to assume the government, with the title of lord of Ireland and a numerous force. But such were the disorders caused by the dis sensions of the English adventurers under the feeble rule of the youthful prince, that his father was compelled within a few months to recall him, and to appoint in his room Hugh de Lacy, a nobleman of courage and ability, as lord deputy \u2014 a title under which the government long continued to be ad ministered by an English officer. But the effective authority of the lord deputy did not reach beyond the pale of the English conquests, which, during the age before us, comprehended little more than the eastern coast, with a connecting chain of fortresses from Downpatrick to Cork; the intruders were engaged with various fortune in per petual hostilities against the native princes; and so obstinate was the resistance of a gal lant though uncivilized and divided people This was Dermot, king of Leinster, who, in consequence of a feud which he had originally excited by carrying off the wife of O'Ruarc, chieftain of Leitrim, had, after some changes of fortune, been finally ex pelled from his dominions by Roderic O'Con nor of Connaught, the king-paramount and supporter of O'Ruarc. Dermot, to secure the powerful protection of Henry, now came personally to do homage to him, and upon these terms obtained his consent to levy a force of English adventurers for the recovery of his dominions. With this royal sanction he found little difficulty in inducing Richard Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, with two knights, Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitz-Gerald, all three men of broken for tunes, to engage in his service. They successively enlisted and carried over small bodies of troops to join the exiled prince, who had secretly preceded them to Ireland; and by the aid of their mailed cavalry and archers, who easily prevailed over the brave but half-armed and undisciplined natives, Dermot was not only restored to his domin ions, but gained many victories over his enemies. Wexford, Waterford, and Dublin rapidly fell by storm before the English auxiliaries; and in attempting to expel the invaders, Asculf, the Northman chieftain of Dublin, the king-paramount O'Connor, and his dependent O'Ruarc, were severally defeated with fatal slaughter. Meanwhile Dermot, who had begun to aspire to the sovereignty of the whole island, died in the midst of these conquests; and the earl of Pembroke, who had espoused his daughter Eva, with the promise of succeeding him, immediately assumed the royal authority.* But the fortunate adventurer had soon reason for alarm at the jealousy which was excited by his enterprise in his own sove reign, with whom he had fallen into dis grace before these transactions. The distrust of Henry was with difficulty appeased by the politic submission of the earl : who, returning to England to meet the king, assured him that he had effected his conquests only for \u2014 so slow, notwithstanding the superiority of their enemies in arts and arms, the pro gress of permanent conquest \u2014 that the total * Giraldus, pp. 775, 776.

Whatever politi cal motives had mingled with his parental affection, Henry had deserved the gratitude of his children by the splendid establishments which he had fondly prepared for them even during his own life. Henry Courtmantel, the eldest, he had caused to be crowned as his successor to the English throne ; Richard, the second, he had invested with the great fief of Aquitaine; and for Geoffrey, the third, he had secured the duchy of Brittany by betrothing him to his ward Constance, the heiress of that province.! The first practices of the French monarch were tried upon Courtmantel, as his son-in-law; and the young prince was easily instigated, first, to demand from his father the complete pos session either of Normandy or of England for enabling him to maintain the dignity of his nominal crown, and on meeting with a refusal, to throw himself into the arms of the confederates. But the bitterest enemy of Henry was his own queen, Eleanor, whose affections he had long alienated by his numerous infidelities, +. and who had learned The paramount sovereignty of Ireland, therefore, was long a barren honour of the English crown. But as an undue import ance was at first attached to its acquisition, it conferred a momentary splendour on the reign in which it was effected, and dazzled the age with the semblance of a glorious conquest. In this respect the enterprise was eminently serviceable to Henry. For having thus easily enhanced the fame of his policy and arms, being now freed from the disquietude of his long struggle with Becket, and relieved by his reconciliation with the papal see from the dangerous consequences which the murder of that prelate had threat ened, he seemed to have attained the summit of fortune and greatness. He had, in fact, become the most successful and powerful prince in Europe; and as such was equally respected and feared by his contemporaries. But he was destined, among a thousand other examples of royalty, to prove and to feel the vanity of human grandeur; and from the very season at which he had gathered the full harvest of ambition, the declining years of his existence began to be harassed by machinations of foreign hostility, and by the more cruel persecution of filial ingrati tude. The natural jealousy with which the preponderance of his vast possessions, and his personal talents and prosperity, were regarded by other princes, caused an exten sive confederacy to be organized against him, with closer concert and greater secrecy than was usual in the loose combinations of that rude state of political society. The French monarch was the principal mover of the plot ; the assistance of the king of Scots, Wdliam the Lion, was engaged, partly through alarm at the increasing power of a formidable neighbour, partly by the hope of obtaining Northumbria for his share of the spoil; and the earls of Flanders, Boulogne, and Blois were tempted by similar views, the first of receiving the county of Kent, * Gervus. p. 1424. Hoveden, p. 532. f The family alliance which the policy of Henry had led him to contract with the king of France produced no other fruits than dissension and misery: but he concluded a mar- riage for Maud or Matilda, one of his daughters, which, though probably less regarded at the time, and not unclouded with vicissitudes, was endowed with more auspicious fortune, in commingling the blood of the Plantagenets and Guelphs. To Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, the chief of the latter house, which was then in the plenitude of its original pride and power, the Princess Maud was married in the year 1165 ; and by a singular chance the duke, in his subsequent reverses, twice found an asylum in a country over which his posterity by Maud, after an interval of above five centuries of comparative obscuritv, were fated to reign with glory and happiness. It is from William, the fourth son of Henry the Lion, whom Maud bore to him during his exile in England, that the present royal family of Great Britain deduces the right, line of its illustrious descent. t According to report, Henry had numerous frail favourites, but the most celebrated among the rivals who are supposed to have provoked the jealousy of Eleanor, was Rosamond, daughter of Lord Clifford the \"Fair Rosamond\" of our -romances, by whom the king had two natural sons.

She it was who not only encouraged the rebellion of her eldest son, but induced his two younger brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, then mere boys, to imitate his example, and herself fled from her husband's court.* Scottish king had poured his barbarous forces into the northern counties.* On the report of these complicated dan gers Henry flew from Normandy to Eng land; and his presence alone sufficed to overawe the rebels and paralyze the designs of the invaders. The first act of the king after landing at Southampton maybe received as a striking proof of the degree to which the strongest minds of that age were the slaves of a grovelling superstition. Instead of attributing the ingratitude of his children to his own false indulgence and crooked policies, or the hostility of his revengeful queen to the provocation of his dissolute life ; instead of seeking in his own ambition and misconduct for the seeds of all the retributive evil which had fallen upon him \u2014 he imagined that the wrath of heaven had been kindled by an involuntary offence. He believed that his misfortunes were judgments of God against him for the rash exclamation by which he had unconsciously instigated the murderers of Becket. To expiate this guilt he had scarcely set foot on shore, when without waiting to refresh himself after the fatigues and discomforts of a rough sea voyage, he hastened to make a pilgrim age to the tomb of the archbishop, whom the pope had lately canonized ; and the greatest sovereign of Europe, barefooted and in the garb of a penitent, before the shrine of his ancient enemy, after publicly and solemnly appealing to heaven that he was innocent of having designed the murder of the saint, implored pardon for his unin tentional fault, and submitted his naked back to be scourged by the monks of Canterbury. After submitting to this fla gellation he went a second time to the subterranean vault in which the body of Becket was deposited, and again prostrating himself before the tomb, he spent the rest of the day and the following night in prayers and tears, taking no nourishment, and remaining on the same spot, \"but as he came so he remained, without carpet or * Gervas. p. 1424 Hoveden, pp. 536-538.

On his very vassals he could place no dependence, for they had been seduced from their allegiance by his wife and children. But with the courage and activity which always distinguished him, he immediately by his gold levied a great army of the Flemish mercenaries, or Brabancons, and soon made head against all his continental opponents. The person of Eleanor, by a lucky chance, fell into his hands at the commencement of hostilities; his rebellious children were thus deprived of her evil counsels; and he detained her in captivity, with one short interval, during the remainder of his life. Without any single action of importance, his forces were everywhere victorious in the continental war: but in England the confederates had succeeded in throwing the whole kingdom into confusion ; and while malcontent baron6 appeared in arms in every quarter upon pretence of sup porting the cause of Henry Courtmantel, that young prince himself was preparing an invasion from the French ports, and the tale of the deadly revenge of Eleanor, and the tragical fate of her victim, appear to be wholly fabulous ; and it may be learned from Hoveden (p. 712) that Rosamond died peaceably in the convent of Godstow, whither she had retired to expiate, by the penances of her latter years, the errors of her youth. The king, says the chronicler, was kind for her sake to the nuns of Godstow, who buried her in their choir ; and he sent them a silken pall to hang over her tomb, as well as costly lamps to illuminate it. But it seems that the bishop of Lin coln was scandalized by these honours to the memory of one \" as frail as beauteous ; \" and obliged the nuns to exhume her body and cast it into the common cemetery, telling them that the mistress of a king was no better than the mistress of a humbler man: which, indeed, was true, though the justice of the sentiment will hardly excuse the indecent and uncharit able insult against the mortal remains of the fair penitent by which it was accompanied * Hoveden, p.

It- was agreed that the conquests made by both sides should be restored ; that all the prisoners should be set at liberty ; that Prince Henry should receive two castles in Nor mandy, and a yearly allowance of \u00a315,000, Angevin money ; Richard, two castles in Poitou, with half the revenues of that earl dom; and Geoffrey, two castles in Brittany, with half the rents of the estates that had belonged to his father-in law elect, Earl Conan, with a promise of the remainder. The king of Scots was the chief sufferer by the war: for he was kept a prisoner for sev eral months in the strong castle of Falaise, and was compelled to purchase his release by the humiliation, not only of renewing in his own person the homage which he had formerly paid to the English crown, but also of summoning his vassals to swear fealty to Henry as their lord paramount, and of surrendering several castles and hos tages as pledges of his good faith.* The capture of his dangerous enemy, the king of Scots, who had already commenced his invasion, and was surprised by Ralph de Granville while tiltin\"- with a few knights under the castle of Alnwick, the tidings of which reached him on the fifth nifrlit of \u00a9 his illness, was the first auspicious event which raised the hopes of Henry ; and the alleged coincidences of this success with the late pilgrimage to Canterbury failed not to confirm the superstitious con fidence of the English monarch and his party that his atonement at the shrine of St. Thomas a, Becket had been accepted by heaven. Perhaps this belief was as service able to the king as the clergy of Canterbury found it conducive to the reputation of their saint, for from the same period the forces of his enemies melted away in every direction. The Scotch army, on learning the captivity of their sovereign, immediately dispersed ; the rebel English barons laid down their arms and submitted to the royal clemency; and Henry was enabled to despatch into Normandy the levies which he had collected to repel the threatened descent of his own son from France.

Both princes having agreed to request his judgment between them, swore by their ambassadors to accept and observe its provisions; and Henry (1177) having summoned a solemn court of his barons and prelates, and taken their opinion on the case, pronounced sentence, that the two kings should mutually restore the lands belonging to each other which th'-y had seized, and that the king of Castilo should satisfy his uncle's claims by a pecuniary payment It appears that no resistance was made by either party to the justice of this award.

Aided by this young and vigorous monarch, Richard, at the head of the malcontent barons of Normandy, experi enced little trouble in driving his father before him through that duchy ; and Henry, enfeebled by bodily infirmities, and oppressed by a sense of the weakness of his age, was glad to conclude a peace on almost any terms with his enemies. His health had Ions been \u00a9 declining; but his heart was broken by a discovery which he made in the course of his negotiations with Philippe, that his favourite son, John, had basely entered into the conspiracy against him. \" Now, then,\" he exclaimed, falling back on his bed, and turning his face to the wall, \" let everything go as it will, I have no longer care for my self or for the world.\" From that hour he fell into a settled melancholy, which was followed by a mortal fever ; and in a few days he breathed his last, 6th July, 1189, in the fifty-seventh year of his age and thirty fifth of his reign, deserted by all his family but an illegitimate son, Geoffrey, at the castle of Chinon, near Saumur.f most in exciting new family convulsions by an attempt to exact homage for Aquitaine from his next brother, Richard. On the refusal of Richard, Plenry, in concert with Geoffrey, the third brother, invaded that duchy with an army of Brabancons ; and the efforts of the old king to reconcile his sons being resented as injuries by the two latter, they turned their arms against their father also. It would, however, serve little pur pose to trace the alternations of hostility and agreement by which these disgraceful family feuds were varied. They were only sus pended for a time by the premature death of young Henry, in the twenty-seventh year of his age (11th June, 1183), the agonized remorse of whose last hours offered but a feeble atonement for the sorrows which his unduteous life had inflicted upon his parent.* The miserable end of his brother seems to have exercised for a brief space a softening effect upon the mind of Prince Geoffrey. He sought his father's pardon, and a recon ciliation took place between Henry and his wife as well as his sons. But this family concord lasted only a few months ; and Geoffrey, on receiving a refusal of the earl dom of Anjou, withdrew to the French court, and once more prepared to commence hos tilities against his father. But soon after (August, 1186), his turbulent career was cut short at a tournament, where he was dis mounted and trampled to death by the feet of the horses of the other knights engaged in the lists. But his death only produced new contentions : for Richard, now become heir-apparent to the English crown, and jealous of his father's affection for John, his only surviving brother, found or feigned sev eral pretences for flying into open rebellion. The chief ostensible cause of dispute was con nected with the Princess Adelais, daughter of Louis VII. of France, and the same who formerly when a child had .been betrothed to Richard, and consigned to the care of his father: but the king, from some jealousy of his son's designs, had ever since kept her immured in one of his castles, and now re- Henry II. was undoubtedly one of the ablest sovereigns that have silled the English throne.

The reign of Henry II. presents a remarkable epoch in the history of English law, by several changes and improvements which that monarch introduced or prosecuted in the internal administration of the kingdom, especially by the regular appointment of itinerant justices, the gradual sub stitution of trial by grand assize for the wager of battle, and the commutation of feudal military service for a scutage or pecuniary payment. But the progress of these important measures may be more appropriately traced in a distinct inquiry into the growth of the legal and constitutional institutions us our country. * Gervas. pp. 14S0-1483.

He was sagacious, energetic, courageous, and active in his movements. He was also kind, generous, and placable. On the other hand, his character was stained by great vices, and he was irascible, ambitious, licen tious, and unscrupulous. Besides his five legitimate sons \u2014 of whom three preceded him to the grave \u2014 and three daughters, Henry left three natural sons, two of them by the \"Fair Rosamond,\" William, sur named Longsword, earl of Salisbury, and Geoffrey, chancellor, and ultimately arch bishop of York, both of whom attained great celebrity, and were always dutiful to their father.

On the death of Henry the English crown, with the possession of all his continental fiefs, was peaceably assumed by Richard as his eldest surviving son. From the un- feeling and furious disposition which that prince had already exhibited in his rebellion against his father, his new subjects might draw the most ominous expectations of a tyrannical reign. It was, therefore, not without general satisfaction that men ob- served, in his first acts after his father's decease, that his nature was not inaccessible to some compunctious emotions. As soon as he saw the lifeless remains of the parent whom he had harassed to the grave, he burst into tears, called himself a parricide, and uttered many bitter self-reproaches. At the same time, as if to expiate his miscon- duct to one parent by his honour of the other, he caused his mother Eleanor to be immediately released from durance, and intrusted her with the government of Eng land until his own arrival from Normandy.* As soon as he had settled with the French king the differences between their two kingdoms, Richard embarked for England, and celebrated his coronation with a ma_;- o nificence which has been deemed worthy, by the chroniclers, of particular description.! The ceremony was, however, disturbed by a transaction so horrid, as strikingly to expose the revolting superstition and sangui nary barbarism of the times. Some wealthy Jews had the imprudence, despite of a pro clamation forbidding the presence of any of their race at the coronation, to intrude into the palace with rich offerings to the king. But they were no sooner perceived in the crowd, than the popular thirst for their blood being artfully assisted by a wicked * Matt Paris p. 107 Hoveden, p. 655. t Gervas y 1519.

The houses of all the Jews in London were attacked, plundered, and fired, and the unhappy inmates, after a desper ate defence, were remorsely slaughtered or driven into the flames. The cupidity of the mob being once excited, the conflagration and pillage were extended until so many of the rich Christian citizens suffered equally with the Jews, that the king was at length compelled to interpose the royal authority for the restoration of order, though only three of the ringleaders received condign punishment ; and they on the charge, not of the murder of the Jews, but of having fired the houses of Christians. But the cruel persecution of the Jews was not confined to the capital ; and at York in particular, where some hundreds of them had sought refuge in the castle, a still more appalling tragedy was enacted. For finding themselves un equal to the defence of the place, these devoted people slew their wives and children with their own hands, to prevent them from falling into the power of their merciless enemies, and then finished the work of im molation by stabbing each other. The few trembling survivors who had wanted courage to share the general fate, surrendered to the mercy of their persecutors, only to encounter a more cruel death. The real instigation and object of these cruelties are discoverable in the fact, that the murderers immediately repaired to the cathedral, and burned all the bonds of Christian debtors which the Jews had there deposited.* of Durham, co-regents in his absence ; in vested his mother with an ample dower; and imprudently bestowed no less than one third of the lands of the kingdom on his worthless brother John. Having made these arrangements, and exhausted every tyran nical and unbecoming expedient to accumu late a vast treasure for the wants of his enterprise, he finally sailed from the Eng lish shores to join his royal confederate in France* The capture of Jerusalem by Saladin, in 1187, and the consequent overthrow of the Latin kingdom, excited a deep feeling throughout Europe. All classes united in an enthusiastic resolution to rescue the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of the infidel conquerors ; and all the principal sovereigns of Europe, except those of Spain, whose efforts were concentrated against the Mussulman power in that peninsula, vowed to lead their national forces to the recovery of Jerusalem. Foremost in preparation as in dignity among them, was the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, in whom a<re had no power either to quench the thirst of glory, or to chill the fire of religious enthusiasm. But the chivalrous devotion of Frederick was regulated by those prudential qualities of a great commander, which had been matured in forty years of warfare; and while he boldly resolved to take the same route through the east of Europe and Asia Minor which had been found so disastrous to former hosts of crusaders, his provident and skilful arrangements showed how attentively he had studied the tremendous lessons of their failure. No individual was permitted to join in the sacred enterprise who was unable to furnish the means of his own support for a whole year; and the march from the confines of Germany to the shores of the Hellespont was conducted with the strictest regularity and discipline. The numbers and composition of the host were worthy of the imperial name and power. Besides his own son, the duke of Suabia, Frederick was attended by the dukes of While these dreadful scenes disgraced his kingdom, Richard was eagerly employed in preparations for embarking in the third Cru sade, in which he had engaged in concert with the king of France. To regulate the administration of England during his ab sence, he called a great council of the realm ; appointed William Longchamp, bishop of Ely, and his justiciary, Hugh Pudsey, bishop * Hoveden, p. 659.

Their mounted attendants swelled the total array of cavalry to sixty thousand; and the infantry, exclu sive of unarmed pilgrims, numbered one hundred thousand men. Throughout their passage over the Greek dominions the German host encountered a repetition of precisely the same course of treacherous hostility, under the hollow semblance of amity, which the Byzantine court and people had pursued in the previous crusades: but the vengeance of his troops was generally restrained by the magnanimous or prudent forbearance of Frederick ; and though he resented the perfidy of the reigning emperor of the East, Isaac Angelus, by refusing to visit Constantinople as a guest, he peace ably transported his formidable host across the Hellespont. The subsequent passage through Asia Minor was a yet severer trial of Frederick's patience and ability; but his genius surmounted every obstacle of climate and warfare, and the march of the imperial army was effected with far superior order, success, and reputation, to that of any pre ceding host of crusaders. The sufferings of a route through burning and waterless deserts admitted indeed of little mitigation; and thousands of the Germans sank under to the greatness of his personal qualities. The Infidels, recovering from the terror inspired by his name and actions, immedi ately renewed their hostilities on the report of his death; and thenceforth the German army was incessantly harassed by attacks, and nearly disorganized by famine, sickness, and the efforts of the enemy. Thus, although Frederick's son, the duke of Suabia, who succeeded to the command, was neither deficient in courage nor ability, so dreadful were the losses of the crusaders that, before they reached the Syrian con fines, their numbers were reduced to one tenth of their original force. Their array was still, however, sufficiently formidable, on their arrival at Antioch, to deliver that principality from the oppression of Saladin, whose troops retired at their approach; and from thence the gallant duke of Suabia, with unbroken spirit, led the remains of the German army to reinforce the crusaders before Acre : but it was only to perish him self of disease, with some thousands of his devoted and wayworn followers, under the walls of that city.* The arrival of the German chivalry before Acre was followed by the memorable insti tution of a martial order of religious knight hood, which, emulating the design of the fraternities of St. John and of the Temple, and surviving the original object of its creation for the defence of Palestine, was fated to perform no inconsiderable part in the subsequent history of northern Europe. Above half a century before the loss of Jerusalem, a German crusader and his lady had founded hospitals in that capital for poor pilgrims of both sexes of their nation ; and when subsequent endowments had enriched these houses, the male brethren were moved by the example of the two great orders to devote themselves to military as well as charitable services. But their efforts had obtained little distinction, and their fraternity was dissolved by the expul- fatigue, agonizing thirst, and the perpetual assaults of the Turcoman hordes, which hung upon their flanks and rear. But the firmness of the Teutonic array repulsed every attack, and prevented any general disaster; and Frederick not only defeated the sultan of Iconium, but stormed his capital and compelled him to sue for peace. Having thus overborne all opposition, the aged hero pursued his way in unmolested and triumphant ardour; until he lost his life in the little Cilician stream of the Calycad nus, either by a fall from his horse, or by imprudently bathing in the icy waters of that mountain torrent. The consequences of this event proved how largely his fol lowers had been indebted for their success \u2022 Hist. Hierosol. pp. 1156-1163. Godfridi Monachi Annales, pp. 348-356. Tageno, pp. 4U7-416.

Its purposes were now recalled to the national attention by the private charity of some individuals among the German army, who supplied the want of regular hospitals by opening their tents before Acre for the reception of their sick and wounded country men; and a number of knights joining their benevolent association, the duke of Suabia seized the occasion to incorporate them for the national honour into a regular order of religious chivalry, in avowed imitation of those of the Hospital and Temple. A papal authority approved the design, invested the new order with the same privileges as its elder co-fraternities, and ordained the rule of St. Augustin for its government. A white mantle with a black cross was ap pointed for the garb of the brotherhood, who were divided into three classes of noble cavaliers, priests, and sergeants, all exclu sively of German race ; and thenceforth under the title of the Teutonic Knights of St. Mary of Jerusalem, the order worthily aspired to an equality in duties and honour with the two great martial fraternities of Palestine.* ducting- their march in concert as far as \u00a9 Lyons, the two monarchs separated at that city, after naming the port of Messina in Sicily as the place of reunion for their combined armaments ; Philippe leading the French forces to embark at Genoa, and Richard proceeding to Marseilles with his army, there to expect the arrival of his fleet* from England. But his impatience would brook no delay; and finding that his own navy had not reached that port, he immedi ately hired a few vessels for the conveyance of his suite, sailed for the Italian coast, and after rashly exposing himself to several dangerous adventures,! crossed into Sicily. Meanwhile the English fleet, after touching at Lisbon on its way and successfully assist ing in the defence of Santarem against a Mussulman army, reached the Mediterranean in safety, received the land forces on board at Marseilles, and entered the port of Messina some days before the arrival either of Philippe or Richard himself. J In Sicily both monarchs wintered with their forces ; and here several circumstances arose to foment into hatred those feelings \u00a9 of ambitious rivalry which naturally sprang from their conflicting pride and pretensions. Against Tancred, the reigning king of Sicily, Richard had several causes of re sentment, for the detention in prison of his While the German army was still thread ing its toilsome march through the deserts \u00a9 D and mountain passes of Asia Minor, the sovereigns of France and England had availed themselves of the maritime position and resources of their states to escape the same dangers and fatigues by a naval passage to the Syrian shores. Both Philippe Auguste and Richard C\u0153ur de Lion were in the full pride of youthful ambition, impatient for chivalric distinction, and actuated far more by the thirst of glory than by the religious spirit of the age. Interchanging vows of eternal friendship, which were as passion ately broken in the first moment of jealous excitement, they had agreed to combine their forces for the sacred expedition; and on the plain of Vezelay in France they reviewed a gallant and well-equipped host, which amounted to one hundred thousand men of both nations and of all arms. Con- * Before his departure from Normandy, Richard promul gated a code of regulations for the government of his fleet, which, as illustrative of the rude principles of marine juris prudence adopted in that age, would be worthy of a place in our naval history. A murderer was to be tied to the corpse of his victim and cast with it into the sea ; or if the crime were committed on shore, to be buried in the same grave with the dead body. A simple blow was to be punished by the immersion of the offender thrice in the sea ; but if blood were drawn, by the loss of his right hand ; abusive language bv a fine A thief was to have his head shaved, tarred, and feathered ; and in that state to be set on shore at the first opportunity.

To enforce redress for these injuries, Richard had recourse to very violent proceedings: seized a castle on his sister's release for her residence, took mili tary possession of other posts, and allowed his troops to commit many excesses. While the French king was interposing as a media tor, the citizens of Messina were provoked to attack the English, and after a bloody engagement, in which the latter prevailed, Richard allowed them to sack the city, and planted his banners on its walls. Philippe was justly offended at an outrage, which in effect, as he resided in Messina, left him a prisoner in the hands of an ally who was also his vassal ; and Richard was at last induced to appease him by withdrawing his troops. The submission of Tancred to all the demands of the English monarch restored the general peace; and Richard generously sent Philippe twenty thousand ounces of gold as the moiety of the sum which he compelled the Sicilian prince to pay in satisfaction of his claims. He also loaded both English and French knights with presents, and on Christmas day feasted the whole chivalry of the two nations, and dis missed every individual with some largess apportioned to his rank. His prodigal dissipation by such means of the treasures which had been wrung from his subjects before his departure on the crusade, exalted his popularity in both armies far above that of his more provident or less wealthy rival, and formed an additional source of jealousy to Philippe. A new ground of quarrel between the two monarchs was soon created by the intelligence that Richard, disregard ing his engagement to marry Alice or Adelais, sister of Philippe, was about to espouse the Princess Berengaria, daughter of Sancho, king of Navarre, who, in effect, soon after arrived in Sicily, escorted by the queen-mother, Eleanor of England. After much dispute, Philippe at last consented to release Richard from his contract upon his promise to pay ten thousand marks, and to restore to Alice the castles which had been assigned as her dower.* Their feuds being thus terminated by a hollow reconciliation, Philippe, on the return of spring, was the first to depart with his forces from the Sicilian shores, and arrived without accident at the Christian camp before Acre: but Richard was less fortunate or prudent. Off the coast of Crete his fleet was dispersed by a storm; and at Rhodes his fiery temper was roused by intelligence that two of his vessels, which had been wrecked on the shores of Cyprus, were plundered and the crews detained in captivity. To revenge this injury he sailed for Cyprus; and having in vain demanded reparation from Isaac, a prince of Comnenian race, who had revolted against the Byzantine throne and seized the government of the island, the English monarch disembarked his troops, took Lymesol, the tyrant's capital, by storm, and being assisted by the defection of the islanders, compelled him to surrender at discretion. The English prince made an ungenerous use of his vic tory: for he threw the fallen usurper into chains, which, with a mockery of respect, were forged of silver; grievously taxed the Cypriots, who had welcomed him as their deliverer; and asserted the title of conquest to the lordship of their island. After celebrating at Lymesol his nuptials with Bcrengaria, which had been deferred in Sicily on account of the season of Lent, Richard finally sailed for Acre. The num bers of his land forces have not been recorded; but the magnitude of the whole armament may be estimated by the enum eration of his fleet, which consisted of fifty galleys of war, thirteen large store-vessels, and above one hundred other transports filled with horses and men. On the short voyage from Cyprus to the Syrian shore, the English navy intercepted an enormous troop-ship of Saladin, having on board, according to the Latin chroniclers, for the Hoveden, pp. 673-688.

The great bulk and lofty sides of this vessel long defied the attacks of the light galleys of the Christians, but she was at length carried by boarding; her hull being either scuttled during the conflict by the desperation of her own crew, or pierced by the beaks of the English galleys, she sank with all her stores; and every soul of the Infidels, except thirty-five, was either mas sacred or drowned.* walls. The garrison and inhabitants, with the exception of some thousand hostages, were permitted to depart unmolested; and the sultan immediately broke up his camp and withdrew from the vicinity of the cap tured fortress. His subsequent failure, from reluctance or more probably from inability, to pay the ransom of the prisoners within the stipulated period, was the signal for a tragedy horribly characteristic of the bar barous and fanatical spirit of crusading warfare. The Mussulman hostages, to the number of above five thousand, being led out from the city to the French and Eng lish camps, were slaughtered in cold blood; and Richard himself, in a letter still extant, boasted of the massacre as an acceptable service to Heaven. The sultan was not slow to revenge this cruelty in the blood of his Christian captives; and on both sides repeated butcheries continued to darken the mutual hatred of the combatants.* A few days afterwards Richard disem barked his army before Acre ; and his arrival was greeted in the Christian camp with enthusiastic rejoicings. Notwithstanding the previous junction of the king of France and his forces, the operations of the long protracted siege had continued to languish : but the English monarch had no sooner landed his battering engines than, despite of an illness under which he was labouring, he caused the attack to be pressed with the utmost vigour; and as well by his personal example as by prodigal rewards, animated the whole crusading host with a new spirit. Every effort of Saladin to rout the besiegers or relieve the place was repulsed; and at length, after an heroic resistance, finding their defences shattered on every side and their numbers daily diminished, the ex hausted and despairing garrison obtained the reluctant permission of the sultan to capitulate. Upon condition that Saladin should restore the wood of the true cross which he had taken in Jerusalem, release fifteen hundred chosen Christian captives, deliver up Acre, and ransom the garrison by the payment of two hundred thousand pieces of gold, the monarchs of France and England agreed to spare the lives of all the Mussulmans in the place. Upon these terms the city was surrendered; and the banner of the cross was again planted on its ruined The capture of Acre was hailed by the Christians as a glad omen of the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. But these sanguine anticipations were shortly chilled by the retirement of the king of France from the crusade. The causes of this secession, for which severe illness afforded some plea, have been sought in feelings of jealousy at the superior glory won during the siege of Acre by the liberality and prowess of his * Hoveden, pp. 692-698. Vinesauf, pp. 329-346. Bohadin, pp. 180-188. Hoveden, indeed, declares that the massacre of the Christian captives by Saladin preceded that of the Turkish hostages by Richard : hut Bohadin says other wise ; and it is not probable that the sultan would thus have provoked the destruction of his people, whom he had wished to save. The expressions in Richard's letter, as given in Hoveden (p. 698) are, Sic, ut decuit, fecimus expirare; and no writer in that fanatical age seems to have imagined that even the cold-blooded slaughter of Infidels could be otherwise than meritorious and acceptable to Heaven. The old romance of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion goes yet a step further: for it exaggerates the glorious deed into the murder of sixty thousand Infidels ; and the author, imagining that the subject deserved to be associated with pleasurable emotions, thus prefaces the tale of the butchery with a poetical descant on the charms of the vernal season.

The eminent political abili ties of Philippe Auguste, indeed, though they placed him in sober estimation at an immeasurable distance above his irrational and fiery rival, were of little weight in the fields of Palestine; the martial qualities by which he was himself distinguished would sustain no comparison with the transcendent personal heroism of the \" Lion-hearted \" Plantagenet; and he who, in the annals of Europe, figures as the ablest monarch and most renowned conqueror of his age, is discerned only through the wild romance of the crusades as the envious or recreant deserter from a Holy War. But the with drawal of Philippe was produced less by any inconsistency in his own character than by the intemperate conduct of Richard. The reckless spirit with which the English king had already wasted so much of the season for action in Sicily and Cyprus, and the intolerable arrogance of pretensions that would brook no control, alike foreboded any but a happy issue to the confederacy of which he was so puissant a member; and unless the king of France had been prepared to submit unconditionally to his capricious and haughty dictation, their separation might alone avert an open rupture, and the total ruin of the crusade. The real disgrace of Philippe was his subsequent perfidy in at tacking the dominions of his absent rival, contrary to the solemn oath which Richard exacted from him on his departure : but the interests of the crusade itself were promoted by his abandoning to his rival the undivided possession of the supreme command ; and as an evidence of his sincerity in the cause, he left with Richard ten thousand of his best troops, under the conduct of the duke of Burgundy.* muster nearly thirty thousand English, French, and German warriors under the standard of the cross. He conducted the advance of this combined force from Acre in a southerly direction upon Jaffa along the sea-shore ; and in the order of his march no inconsiderable share of military skill and discipline is observable. Nearest to the coast, and in communication with the Eng lish fleet, which attended the expedition with supplies of provisions and stores, were the camp train and followers; while the army itself, covering these accessories, moved in five divisions: the Templars in the van, the Hospitallers closing up the rear, and the archers and other light-armed foot on the left or outward flank to check with their missiles the desultory but galling onsets of the Turkish cavalry. By day, clouds of these horsemen hovered around the front, flank, and rear of the Christians, and harassed their march with incessant assaults : by night, Saladin encamped in their vicinity, and broke the repose of the wearied soldiery with frequent alarms. But the firm array, the unshaken valour, and the patient* determination of the Europeans, exhausted all the artifices of Asiatic warfare. The daily march was accomplished in com pact array, and with a slow but resolute advance ; at sunset the army regularly halted ; and thrice during the night the loud voices of the heralds, breaking the deep silence of the camp with solemn injunction to remem ber the Holy Sepulchre, roused the slum bering sentinels of the religious host to watchfulness and prayer. At length Saladin, reinforced by new swarms of the Moslems from all parts of his empire, and finding every desultory attempt to arrest the pro gress of the Christians unavailing, resolved upon one mighty effort to accomplish their After the retirement of the French king, Richard prepared to resume the design of the war,f and still found himself able to to Vinesauf, \" vino peroptimo et puelhs pulcherrimis,\" that by deep potations the countenances of the gravest warriors in the host had contracted a disgraceful rubicundity. * The heroic fortitude of the crusaders is attested by the unsuspicious evidence of an enemy and an eye-witness.

On the morning of the sixteenth* day after the advance of the crusaders from Acre, the brazen kettle-drum of the sultan sounded the attack; and the whole Infidel host was suddenly precipitated, in one tremendous charge, upon the Christian array. So rapid and furious was the onset, so vastly superior were the numbers of the assailants, and so overwhelming the force and weight of the shock, that the small squadrons of the crusaders, inclosed within their own infantry, were for a time crushed together from all sides by the pressure. Galled by the Turkish arrows, the chivalry impatiently demanded permission to extri cate themselves by a charge : but the fiery Plantagenet, now alone calm, cool, and collected, and foreseeing a decisive victory, restrained the impetuosity of his knights until he observed that the quivers of the Infidels were emptied and their strength exhausted. Then, causing the infantry to open out, he led and let loose the Christian chivalry in all directions upon the wavering enemy. The whole Turkish host, unable to resist the vigour and strength of these steel-clad squadrons, broke and fled to the adjacent hills. So successful and sanguinary were the charge and pursuit, that above twenty emirs and seven thousand of the flower of the Turkish cavalry were slain on the field; and the result justified the boast of Richard that, in forty campaigns, the veteran sultan had never sustained so severe a defeat, f his success by advancing against Jerusalem, but was prevented by the factious opposition of the French barons, who, seconded by the wish of the army to repose from their fatigues, insisted upon the necessity of first rebuilding the fortifications of Jaffa and its dependencies.* However this might have been, two months were consumed in restor ing these works, and in vain negotiations with Saladin, f before the crusaders again moved forward towards Jerusalem. They penetrated without serious opposition to Ramula, within a short distance of the Holy City. But here the inclemency of the season, want of provisions, and the conse quent and alarming increase of sickness, arrested their march; and Richard himself admitted the present hopelessness of success. The army, therefore, fell back to the coast; and the winter was spent by the soldiery in repairing the walls of several of the con quered fortresses, and by their leaders in treacherous intrigues or violent dissensions. At length, on the return of spring, Richard so far succeeded in restoring unanimity as to assemble all the Christian forces in Pales tine under his standard; and at their head again he advanced towards Jerusalem. The general enthusiasm of the army was kindled by the renovated hope of success ; the chief tains and soldiery joined in a solemn oath * During this cessation of active hostilities, Richard, while pursuing the sport of falconry, with his usual imprudence, beyond the precincts of the Christian lines, was attacked by a party of Saracens; and only escaped captivity or death through the generous devotion of a Provencal knight named Guillaume de Pratelles, who drew off the attention of the enemy by feigning to be the king, and as such surrendered himself. Richard proved not ungrateful : for his last care in Palestine was to ransom his preserver. Vinesauf, p. 372. t In the course of these negotiations, which were more than once interrupted and resumed, Richard and Saladin seem to have seriously entertained a singular project for an accom modation of the Christian and Moslem interests by means of a marriage between Saphadin, or Malec-al-Adel, the brother of the sultan, and the widowed queen of Sicily, sister of the English king, who had accompanied him to Palestine. With his Christian bride the Mussulman prince was to receive from his brother the sovereignty of Jerusalem: but the whole design, according to Bohadin, though agreeable to both Saladin and Richard, was frustrated by the repugnance of both Asiatics and Europeans to so unnatural an alliance. Bohadin, p. 209. During the negotiations, however, the two armies mingled in constant and amicable intercourse; and frequent kindnesses were interchanged between their sove reigns. When Richard was ill, Saladin sent him the choicest fruits, and the yet greater refreshment of snow during the burning heats us summer. Hoveden, p. 093. After this signal victory the crusaders, without further molestation by the Infidels, pursued their triumphant march to Jaffa; and Saladin having wisely destroyed the works of fortresses which he was hopeless of preserving, they took possession both of that city and C\u00e6sarea, with other dismantled castles in their vicinity.

They had already been reduced to sue for a capitulation, when Richard arrived off the port to their succour. He had prepared to embark for Europe before he heard of their danger; but fired with indignation that Saladin should have re- newed the offensive while his foot was still on the strand of Palestine, he threw himself into a galley, and followed only by a few knights and archers in six other vessels, sailed for Jaffa, leaving his army to retrace their march after him along the coast. When his small squadron had approached the shore, finding that some of the garrison still held out, he plunged into the sea; his attendants, inspired by the heroic example, quickly followed ; and the opposing Moslems on the beach were so dismayed by the fury of the attack that they fled before this hand- ful of assailants, and abandoned Jaffa to its deliverers. Though Richard, including tbe rescued garrison, had with him only fifty- five knights, of whom but ten were mounted, and two thousand foot soldiers, he displayed his contempt for the Infidels by encamping without the gates; and in this situation on the morrow of his arrival the Turkish cavalry, recovering from their surprise and ascertaining the scantiness of his force, attacked him with overwhelming numbers. He not only sustained their repeated charges, but each time rushed into the thickest of their squadrons at the head of his ten But at this critical juncture the sultan was delivered from his apprehensions by the unexpected retreat of the crusading host. The causes of this failure are vari- ously ascribed by the Christian chroniclers to the contemplated difficulties of a siege, to the envious or treasonable defection of the duke of Burgundy and his French followers, and to the indecision of Richard himself. But the best attested account is that which refers the abandonment of the enterprise to the act of the king.f Whether he was swayed by his usual impulses of caprice, urged to hasten his return to Europe by repeated intelligence of the dangerous machinations of his faithless brother and rival, or secretly conscious that the resources of the crusade were unequal to the capture of Jerusalem, it is vain to inquire. But he suddenly paused in his operations, and when its walls were within his view, proposed the appointment of a council, selected from among the barons of Palestine and the \u00a9 chiefs of the military orders, to decide upon oath if it were preferable to engage in the siege of the Holy City, or to make a diver- sion against Damascus or Cairo. To the \u00a9 general surprise and disappointment, the council decided upon the expediency of deferring the enterprise before them; and Richard, amidst the discontent of the whole army, commenced a second and final retreat to the sea-coast. Yet whatever were the motives of necessity or inconstancy which dictated this resolve, he poignantly felt the mortification or shame of his failure; and when one of his followers led him to a * Hoveden, pp. 698-714.

Never had even he performed such prodigies of valour and personal strength ; whole squadrons of the quailing Infidels fled before his single arm ; and the Mussulman writers themselves are the most admiring witnesses and warmest eulogists of these incredible exploits.* Night put an end to the unequal combat; but so hopeless was Saladin of prevailing against the hero, that he raised the siege of Jaffa without any further attempt. f While Richard I. was pursuing in the fields of Palestine his career of brilliant but use- less achievement, his own dominions were the prey of domestic and foreign treason. The chancellor, William Longchamp, bishop of Ely, to whom, in conjunction with Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, the king had committed the government of England during his absence, proved rapacious and tyrannical, f He not only contrived to despod his colleague of all share in the regency, but also disgusted the whole body of the nobility and people by his insolence and extortions. The public hatred provoked by this maladministration was artfully fomented by the intrigues of Richard's own brother, the infamous John. The hopes of that prince had been raised by the proba- bility that the king would perish in a war- fare and climate which had ever proved fatal to the far greater portion of the noblest as well as the lowliest champions of the Cross. In the event of Richard's death the succes- sion to his dominions would devolve by right on an infant, Arthur \u2014 the orphan son of Geoffrey, an elder brother of John \u2014 whom the king had already publicly recognized as This was the last and most brilliant achievement of the lion-hearted king on the shores of Palestine ; and with it ended the third crusade. The exertions of Richard brought on a fever which increased his longing desire to return to Europe ; and the awe inspired by his prowess and victory facilitated his overtures for a renewal of former negotiations. Saladin himself was weary of fruitless hostilities, and languish ing under a bodily decline, which in a few months bowed him to the grave. Richard consented to dismantle the fortifications of Ascalon, which as the key of Egypt from the Syrian frontiers, was in the hands of the Christians an object of jealous disquietude to the sultan ; and the latter on his part agreed to leave them in unmolested pos session of Tyre, Acre, and Jaffa, with all the maritime territory between the first and last of those cities, to abstain also from attacking the territories of the prince of Antioch and count of Tripoli, and to grant * This concurrent testimony of Christian and Mohammedan writers compels history to ascribe to Richard feats of personal heroism which might otherwise be dismissed as the dreams of romance. Such was the admiration which he extorted from his enemies, that Saphadin, during his last action before Jaffa, observing him dismounted, sent him two Arabian horses, on one of which he continued the conflict until nightfall. Some time before, the same Turkish prince had solicited and obtained, at the hands of the Christian hero, the honour of knighthood for his son. But the most striking proof of the reality of his astonishing prowess, is the enduring terror in which his very memory was held by the Moslems : for above half a century after his fiery spirit had been quenched in the grave, \" his tremendous name was employed by Syrian mothers to silence their infants; and if a horse suddenly started from his way, his rider was wont to exclaim, 'Dost thou think King Richard is in the bush ?

Bohadin, p. 260. f Richard had created Longchamp chief justiciary of Eng land, but had given the bishop of Durham jurisdiction north of the Humber. He had also induced the pope to name Long champ as his legate for England and Scotland ; wishing, says Hoveden, to exalt him above all the clergy as well as laity of the realm. This union of temporal and spiritual authority in the person of the chancellor was calculated to excite the jeal ousy of the ecclesiastical body, and may account in part for the vituperation of monkish chroniclers ; but the administra tion of Longchamp was evidently oppressive.

As a consequence of these acts, Longchamp was compelled to retire to Normandy, and John obtained the real direction of affairs. Mean wdiile Philippe Auguste, on his return to France from the Holy Land, had everywhere so defamed the conduct, and exhibited a spirit so hostile to the interests of his rival, as to leave no doubt of his disposition, in concert with the traitorous brother of the absent monarch, to disturb the peace of his continental dominions.* As, therefore, the possession of the reins of government by the chancellor threatened to oppose the greatest obstacle to his success, he spared no endeavour to effect the removal of that minister ; and his designs were assisted both by the usual disorders of a feudal constitution, and by the oppressive conduct of Longchamp himself. While the latter was besieging the castle of Lincoln, which he wished to wrest from the hands of its governor, John surprised two more of the royal fortresses ; and the chancellor, thus weakened, was compelled to compromise for the retention of his functions as regent, by surrendering several other places of strength belonging to the crown into the hands of different barons, under oath to hold them for Richard during his life, and in case of his death to deliver them to John. Long champ was soon afterwards involved in a still more dangerous collision with a member of his own order, as well as of the royal blood. This was the archbishop of York, natural brother of the king, from whom Richard, in the indulgence of an ancient enmity, had extorted an oath that he would not enter England for three years, but who now, despite of that obligation, landed from the Continent to take possession of his see. In the struggle to enforce the royal prohibi tion, Longchamp was deserted by the prelates and barons of the realm, to whose judgment he had offered to submit. At a great coun cil held at Reading, under the instigation of John, and upon the pretended sanction of letters obtained from Richard in Sicily, the chancellor was removed from the ad ministration; one of his enemies, the arch- The sinister rumours of these disorders and machinations, which had reached him in Palestine, had prompted or increased the impatience of Richard to return to Europe. Having despatched before him the English fleet, with his Queen Berengaria and her train, who disembarked in Italy, and thence passing through Marseilles, reached Poitou in safety, the king himself followed them from Acre in a single vessel. He watched from her deck the last view of the receding shores, on which he had already expended the efforts of his heroism and the best blood and treasures of his realm, and his passionate emotions were expressed in his intent gaze, his outstretched arms, and the ejaculation which burst from his lips: \" Most hallowed soil ! to the care of the Almighty I commend thee: may He grant me life to return and achieve thy deliverance from the Paynim yoke ! \" The first disaster of his ill-omened voyage was a succession of adverse winds, which compelled him to touch at Corfu, where he hired three coasting-vessels to ascend the Adriatic. By this time, indeed, his situation had become very critical, for it was already known in Europe that he was at sea without the protection of his fleet; and he had reason to dread that, through whatever course he might attempt to reach his own dominions, his passage would be intercepted by powerful enemies. Among * Nothing can be more explicit than this recognition of Arthur in the treaty with Tancred, printed in Rymer (F\u0153dera, ed. secunda, Tonson, 1727, vol. i. p. 66), and in which Richard calls him, \" carissimum nepotem nostrum et h\u00e6redem, si forte sine prole nos obire contigerit.\" And again (p. 67), \" Si autem nobis sine h\u00e6redibus decedentibus, ipse ad regnum nostrum h\u0153reditario jure pervencrit,\" _c. * Hoveden, pp. 398-403.

The artifice succeeded: for while Maynard proceeded to arrest De Bethune and his suite, the king reached Freisach unmolested. Here, however, the news that he was in the coun- try having spread, his speech discovered him to a Norman knight in the imperial service ; but the generous soldier, preferring his fidelity to his native liege lord above the hope of gain, apprized him of his danger, and assisted his further flight. By this aid, though six of his attendants were taken, Richard himself, with one knight, and a boy who spoke German, effected his escape; and riding day and night without entering a house, on the fourth morning reached the suburbs of Vienna. Here he was aware of the imminence of his danger: for he had no bitterer enemy than Leopold, duke of Austria, as brother-in-law of Isaac the de throned despot of Cyprus, and whose pride also, according to some accounts, he had grievously outraged at the siege of Acre, by throwing his banner into the ditch, because the duke had presumed to plant it on the walls in presence of the royal person and standard of England.* But a fugitive lurking in the capital of his insulted enemy, Richard was now become too ill to proceed further; to supply the wants of the party it was necessary to send the boy repeatedly to market, and the display of his money, or the incongruity of his rich apparel with his menial errand, having excited suspicion, he these he might number not only the king of France, but the emperor (Henry VI.) of Germany, who, as claiming the crown of Sicily, was offended by his alliance with Tancred; and various Italian and German chieftains, relatives or friends of the deceased Conrad of Montferrat, all of whom had been taught to regard him as the murderer of that prince.* To travel, therefore, in his avowed character through France, Germany, or Italy, would be equally dangerous; but his own tempest-tossed bark was incapable of com pleting the voyage to England, and he had evidently formed the design of landing at some port of the Adriatic, and crossing the Continent in disguise. He suffered his beard and hair to grow, assumed the garb of the adjacent country and the character of a pil grim, and, in order to prosecute his voyage, removed with only twenty attendants into one of the small coasters which he had hired. But in this vessel a new accident deprived him of all choice of destination ; for he was either shipwrecked, or at least driven by stress of weather on the Istrian coast between Aquileia and Venice, f where landing he was reduced to send one of his train to May nard, count of Gortz, or Goritz, to solicit a passport through the territories of that chief tain \u2014 a nephew of Conrad of Montferrat \u2014 for Baldwin de Bethune, Hugh the Mer chant, and other pilgrims returning from the Holy Land.

But the statement in the emperor's letter to the king of France (contained in both Hoveden, p. 410, and Rymer, vol. i. p. 70) is plain \u2014 and the superior accuracy of his information can hardly be doubted \u2014 that the spot, was inter Aquil\u0153am et Venetias.

That retreat Leopold, overjoyed at the discovery, immediately caused to be surrounded by his followers while Richard slept; and when the unhappy monarch, starting from his couch, refused to surrender to any but their lord, the duke himself came forward and received his sword. The first act of the Austrian towards his royal captive was to immure him in the fort ress of Tyernstein; the next to sell his person to the emperor. By the order of the im perial tyrant, the great champion of the Cross, whose exploits had filled all Christen dom with admiration and all Islam with terror, was unworthily consigned to a dun geon in the Tyrol, loaded with chains, and insulted by the continual presence, day and night, of sentinels witb drawn swords.* the \" enemy of the empire and the disturber of France\"* was his prisoner.

But the brave earl of Leicester, who had lately landed from Palestine, threw himself into the place ; and the citizens, animated by his denunciations against the recreant and treacherous monarch who had deserted the service of the Cross, defended their walls with so much vigour that Philippe was compelled to raise the siege with disgraces Nor did better success attend the projects through which another enemy of the captive king \u2014 his own false and despicable brother John \u2014 trusted to profit by his misfortunes. The first act of that fraternal traitor, on receiving the intelligence of Richard's im- o \u00a9 prisonment, was to hasten to Paris : where having concerted his measures with Philippe Auguste, by engaging to resign to that mon arch a part of Normandy, and performing homage for the remaining French fiefs of D O the house of Anjou, he returned to England for the purpose of forcibly seizing the crown. But the nobles and people were staunch in their allegiance to their imprisoned king, and already on their guard against the attempted usurpation. Although the arch bishop of Rouen, who had remained at the head of the regency since the expulsion of Longchamp, was suspected of connivance at the projects of John, the barons and prelates of the realm compelled him to display the royal standard at their head ; and themselves, with all classes of the people, renewed their oaths of allegiance to Richard. By these precautions, when John attempted to intro duce a levy of foreign mercenaries into the kingdom from Flanders, the faithful vassals of the crown were readily arrayed to repel their descent on the coast; and their em- Meanwhile, when it had become known in England that Richard had sailed from Acre, and no further certain intelligence was received of his course, the kingdom began to be agitated with the most vague O D \u00a9 and contradictory rumours; and the nation, blinded to the faults of their chivalrous monarch by the dazzling splendour of his exploits against the Infidels, were excited to the liveliest degree of impatience for his appearance and anxiety for his safety. Such was the state of popular suspense on his account, when the evil tidings of his capti v^Jy were suffered to transpire to his subjects through the French court, in consequence of a letter announcing the event from the emperor to Philippe Auguste. In that document, still extant, the imperial writer, neither dissembling his own joy on the occasion, nor his knowledge that it would be fully shared by his \" dear and special friend\" Philippe, informed that prince that * The circumstances which attended Richard's voyage from Acre, subsequent landing, journey to Vienna, and capture, are contained chiefly in Hoveden, p. 408, in the emperor's letter above quoted, and in Matthew Paris, Historia Major (Ed. Watts, London, 1684), pp. 143-145. The German version of the tale of Richard's capture, as given by Otho de Blaise, differs from the narration of our English chroniclers. * \"Inimicus imperii nostri et turbator regni tui, Ricardus rex Angli\u0153,\" _c.

Here, before a tribunal to which he owed no submission, the king of England was formally arraigned on the several charges of having supported the usurper Tancred in Sicily against the imperial rights, wrong fully seized the crown of Cyprus, insulted the German nation at the siege of Acre, and procured the murder of Conrad of Montfer rat. Against all these accusations, Richard, condescending to plead, made so spirited, clear, and conclusive a defence, that the princes of the diet were filled with admira tion of his deportment, and unanimously proclaimed their conviction of his innocence.* The indignation which the wrongs in- \u00a9 \u00a9 flicted on the English king were calculated to excite in every chivalrous and religious mind of the age, was not felt by his own subjects only. Throughout Europe, except by the personal enemies of Richard, the conduct of the emperor in consigning the most illustrious champion of the Cross to a dungeon was regarded with horrorand detest- \u00a9 \u00a9 ation. The clergy, in particular, were loud and vehement in their reproaches against the imperial tyrant ; and Pope Celestin found himself compelled by the public voice of Christendom to interfere in favour of the captive monarch. The queen mother Elea nor, also, who had shown herself most active in his cause against the machinations of her other son John, addressed repeated solicita tions to the pontiffs in his behalf; and at length Celestin menaced both the emperor and the French king with excommunication unless the one should release his royal pri soner, and the other abstain from attacking 7 o his dominions. This threat was doubtless not without its weight upon the mind of the German monarch, for at the intercession of the exiled chancellor Longchamp, who had found his way to his master's aid,t. Henry After this scene, which on the part of the emperor seems to have been enacted only to invest the lawless seizure of Richard's per son with the character of a judicial procedure, Henry himself joined in the general verdict of acquittal, ordered the chains of the royal prisoner to be struck off, and thenceforth treated him with becoming respect. But this hypocrisy served only to expose more disgracefully the imperial injustice and ava rice. For when every pretext for detaining the king of England in captivity was thus publicly removed, Henry still persisted in treating him as a prisoner of war, and de manded the enormous sum of one hundred thousand marks of silver, of Cologne weight, as his immediate ransom, with hostages for * \u00a9 the future payment of fifty thousand more.f * Hoveden, pp. 412, 413.

The plate of all the churches was seized under a royal pledge that suture restitution of the value should be made; every knight's fee in the kingdom was taxed twenty shillings; and both clergy and laity were compelled to contribute one-fourth of a year's income. Even these contributions failed to produce the required sum; and it was not without many violent and repeated extortions from the people that seventy thousand marks' weight of silver was at length collected.* or for the extortion of his ransom, that the emperor also bestowed on him the titular fief of the kingdom of Aries or Provence ; and at length, after his imprisonment had been protracted to above twelve months, and the portion of the ransom* already collected, together with English hostages for the payment of the remainder, had arrived in Germany, Richard was suffered to quit the imperial court. He lost no time in proceeding to the coast; and embarking at Antwerp on board his own fleet, arrived safely on the English shores, after an absence of above four years. f The appearance of the king was hailed by his affectionate subjects with the most eager delight : but the first acts of Richard after restoration to his liberty and throne were characteristic of his impetuous and reckless temper, and betrayed his ungrateful in sensibility both to the attachment and the welfare of his people. His presence sufficed to crush the faint show of resistance which the small and discomfited faction of his traitorous brother had still opposed to the regency; and the only two fortresses, of Tickhill and Nottingham, among those held by John's retainers which had not previously been reduced by the royal officers, yielded at his summons. After their surrender, he thought little of healing the wounds which his absence had inflicted on the kingdom, for his spirit was burning with the thirst of vengeance against his enemy, the French monarch. He assembled at Nottingham a great council of the realm, not to regulate its disordered affairs, but to contrive, for the prosecution of the war against Philippe Auguste, new exactions from a faithful people, already distressed by the pecuniary sacrifices which had been cheerfully made for his redemption. Here several offices of state were arbitrarily taken from their present Still the emperor hesitated to relax his grasp of so valuable a prey as Richard : for his cupidity was strongly tempted by offers both from Philippe Auguste and John, who engaged either to give him a larger sum for the possession of the royal prisoner than the stipulated ransom, or to pay him a thousand pounds of silver every month as long as he should detain the English king a captive. The avarice of Henry was not proof against this bait of lucrative infamy ; and he would have broken his engagement with Richard, with the same shameless audacity which enabled him to avow to his prisoner the receipt of the degrading pro- posal, if the princes of the empire, who had plighted their faith as sureties for the imperial fulfilment of the treaty of release, had not compelled their sovereign to respect their honour and his own. Richard him- self had recourse to a remarkable and trot very high-spirited act to propitiate the imperial favour, for in a public assembly of the German feudatories he solemnly resigned his crown to Henry, and received it again to be held as a fief of the empires It was perhaps to console him for this degradation, * A traveller in Germany in the seventeenth century declares that part of this sum '\" beautified Vienna ; and the two walls round the city, the one old and inward, little considerable at present, were built with the ransom of Richard I.\" Brown, Travels in Germany, 4to, 1677, p. 74, cited by Mr. Mills, Hist, of the Crusades, vol. ii. p. 79. t Hoveden, pp. 414 \u2014 418.

The king also proclaimed himself heir to all the Jews throughout the realm who had per- ished, as already related, in the massacre of their unhappy race soon after his accession; and the royal justices in their circuits were instructed both to lay fines on the murderers, and to exact payment from the debtors of the victims. The permanent establishment of itinerant judges in the preceding reign, from which so great benefits have been derived in later times, was now indeed employed in various ways to increase the royal revenue; and those officers were directed to make rigid inquisition into the value of taxable lands, the falling in of escheats and wardships f to the crown, the assessment of tallages to be borne by cities and burghs, and all other means, just or unjust, of swelling the amount of taxation .| holders, and sold to the highest bidders; an impost of two shillings a hyde * was levied on all the lands of the kingdom; and the feudal tenants of the crown were required to follow the royal standard to Normandy. Then, having previously attainted of treason both his brother John, and Hugh, bishop of Coventry, the principal adviser of that prince; and having renewed the ceremony of his coronation, which according to the ideas of his times seems to have been con sidered necessary after his captivity \u2014 the king hastened to embark at Portsmouth for his continental dominions.! But seven weeks had elapsed since the return of Richard from captivity, before he thus again abandoned the English shores, which he was destined never to revisit; and the last five, like the first four, years of his reign were consumed in absence from a country, to the happiness or misery of whose inhabitants he was alike heartlessly indif ferent, as long as he could extort from their possessions a revenue sufficient for his prodigal expenditure. The domestic records of England at this epoch, therefore, are filled only with complaints of the grievous taxes raised by the king's justiciary or agent, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury; who, we are assured, in two years alone, sent over to Normandy, for the use of his master, no less than eleven hundred thousand marks of silver :| an enormous and almost incredi ble sum, if we consider the high value of money in that age and the probable relation of such an amount to the whole property of the kingdom. The iniquity of the means by which these supplies were obtained, is less doubtful than the extent of the produce. The great seal was broken ; all grants under it were declared void ; and the holders were compelled to pay large fines for their re- It may reasonably be conjectured that the national discontent at these oppressive exac tions had a considerable share in producing those vigorous measures for restraining the tyranny of the crown, which had so glorious a success in the following reign ; but during the life of Richard, the murmurs of his people were diverted from the rapacity of the royal government against the immunities \"The knavish process through which this was effected, added the meanness of fraudulent trickery to the despotic viola tion of law.

The instigator of the popular hostility to these orders was an artful demagogue, William Fitz-Osbert, vulgarly surnamed Longbeard, a lawyer of Saxon or native English descent, who, while he pretended to respect the royal authority, inveighed against the cupidity of the Nor man aristocracy in church and state, and acquired by his harangues so great an influence over the lesser citizens and popu lace of London, as to receive the title of \" advocate or protector of the poor.\" In this avowed capacity, passing into Normandy to state the grievances of his clients, Fitz- Osbert succeeded so well in flattering the \u00a9 humour of Richard that he returned to London with increased confidence; and no less than fifty thousand of the lowest orders in the capital are declared to have enrolled themselves under his guidance. But the wealthier classes of citizens having expe rienced that plunder was the object of this association, Archbishop Hubert, the justi ciary, found himself strong enough to pro ceed against the demagogue ; and Longbeard, after murdering an officer who attempted to arrest him, and fleeing to the sanctuary of a church, was forced from his retreat by the edifice being fired, wounded and taken in the attempt to escape, and immediately tried, condemned, and hanged at Tyburn with eight of his associates. The populace being thus deprived of their leader, were easily reduced to subjection: but Fitz-Osbert had so endeared himself to them, that they regarded his memory with veneration, and believed miracles to be wrought at his tomb ; nor was it until some of its propagators had been severely punished, that the growth of the delusion or imposture was effectually repressed.* to either party. Philippe, on his return to Europe from his crusade in the Holy Land, in spite of the solemn compact which bound him to strict amity with his recent com panion in arms, made no scruple of violating those oaths, and stimulated and assisted the treacherous designs of Prince John upon the crown of his chivalric brother, who languished meanwhile, first in the Austrian dungeons, afterwards in those of the Emperor Henry VI. The brief letter by which the king of France advised the would-be usurper that Richard was freed from captivity, \"Take care of yourself, for the devil is unloosed,\" * and the refuge which he afforded the fugi tive, when in consequence of that expressive despatch he hastily crossed the channel to Normandy, were repaid by John with a signal act of perfidy. Less confident of permanent support from Phflippe than that of pardon from the generous temper of Richard, he invited the French garrison which had been placed under his command at Evreux to a splendid banquet; and sur rounding his victims, while revelling and unarmed, by his own body-guard, he massacred three hundred men in cold blood, fixed their heads on the battlements, and took possession of the city in the name of the king of England, f Philippe in his just anger laid Evreux in ashes; a re venge which the activity of Richard, who had now entered Normandy, was not able to prevent. In the desultory wTar which followed, the king of England more than retaliated. Laying an ambuscade near Vendome, he surprised Philippe, wholly unprepared for attack, and seated at break fast, under a woodside in a sequestered valley.

The English, unsuspicious that the chief object of their pursuit was so near at hand, passed on in full gallop.* All the plate, baggage, and treasure of the vanquished host became the prize of the conquerors; and among the booty were the royal archives, the revenue accounts, the registers of the exchequer, and the king's privy signet.f With the exception of some skirmishes of this char acter, the protracted struggle between the fiery monarch of England and his royal antagonist was absolutely undistinguished by any transactions worthy of note. It was characterized by all that absence of well sustained and organized action which is so often observable in the national wars, and may be ascribed to the peculiar martial polity of the feudal ages; and the whole contest partook more of the features of a petty quarrel between two marauding barons, than of a great trial of strength for dominion between the puissant monarchs of France and England. Both sovereigns, indeed, were influenced by the ordinary considerations of ambitious policy, much less than they were stimulated by a spirit of personal hatred, which seemed to grow but the more deadly by its indulgence; their efforts were sus pended only through the exhaustion of their pecuniary and military resources; and as often as these were replenished and refreshed, their animosity urged them to renew the ravages of a ferocious warfares temporary chronicler calls it, of gold and silver having been found buried in the terri tory of one of his vassals, Yidomar, viscount of Limoges, that nobleman immediately sent the king a portion: but not satisfied with a share, Richard, as superior lord of the soil, insisted upon the surrender of the whole; and on meeting with a refusal, proceeded at the head of a band of his Brabancon mer cenaries to besiege the viscount's castle of Chaluz. On his arrival before the place the terrified garrison offered to capitulate; but Richard sternly replied that their submission was now too late, and that since he had been compelled to appear in arms for the assertion of his sovereignty, he would hang every man of them as rebels. Having thus driven them to desperation, he was riding round the walls with Marchades, the com mander of his mercenaries, to select a point of assault, when a young archer of the gar rison named Bertram de Gourdon, with fatal aim, sent a shaft through his shoulder. The enraged monarch immediately gave the signal of attack ; the castle was carried by storm, and all its defenders, except Gourdon, were hanged on the instant. The wound which he had inflicted on the king was not neces sarily mortal ; but the mismanagement of the surgeon in extracting the head of the arrow, joined, perhaps, to some licentious in dulgence in the royal patient's usual habits, produced a mortification, and Richard be came sensible that his hours were numbered. He awaited the approach of death with characteristic firmness: confessed his sins; received the sacrament with expressions of penitence; and made a testamentary dispo sition of his dominions and property. After these preparations for his end, he sent for the captive Gourdon, whom he had doubt less at first reserved for the punishment of some more lingering and cruel death than his comrades, and demanded of the man \"What evil he had done to him that he should seek his life?\" Gourdon dauntlessly replied, \" My father and my two brothers you slew with your own hand, and me you intended to hang.

These liberal commands of the dying monarch were, however, secretly dis regarded by the brutality of Marchades; and that monster, still detaining the ill fated Gourdon a captive until Richard had expired, ordered him then to be flayed alive, f associates and personal dependants, the sums which supplied his profusion were wrung with unfeeling tyranny, or extorted by the most fraudulent perversion of justice, from his oppressed and defrauded subjects. In his private life he appears to have been as reckless of religion and morality, as in his public administration he was indifferent to the sense of duty and the pleadings of humanity. In short, obstinate, rash, and sanguinary in his courage ; capricious in his generous feelings, and vindictive in his en mities; mean in his pride, and rapacious in his prodigality; amidst his martial triumphs, the slave of every violent and licentious im pulse \u2014 there is little in the very heroism of Richard I. to redeem the vices of a rebellious son, a faithless husband, an ungrateful sove reign, and an impatient tyrant* The exploits and the adventures of Richard I. have imparted to the narrative of his life more of the brilliant hues of romance than may usually be mingled with the graver colouring of authentic history; and willing to enhance the interest of the tale in the portraiture of its hero, some writers have depicted the \"lion-hearted\" monarch him- self as a perfect exemplar of the chivalric character in all its ideal excellence. The real qualities of Richard will hardly sustain an inquiry into the justice of this preten- sion. The praise of valour in the highest degree must indeed be freely conceded to the great champion of the Cross : but this was almost the only attribute, even among the boasted virtues of heroism, which may justly be claimed for him. If his natural abilities were good, they were seldom shown, and never well directed. If he was not in- capable of a magnanimous action, his conduct when his evd passions were provoked was usually selfish, unjust, revengeful, and cruel; if he was lavish of gold to his knightly King John. \u2014 a.d. 1199-1216. As Richard I. left no legitimate children, the succession to his dominions should, according to every rule of hereditary right, have descended to his nephew, Arthur, duke of Bretagne, son of Geoffrey, an elder brother of John; and we have seen that Richard himself had formerly, in his treaty with Tancred of Sicily, solemnly recognized the young prince as his heir. But the queen dowager, Eleanor, who detested Constance, the mother of Arthur, seems to have ex tended this feeling to her innocent grand son; and modern historians have, if not by contemporary evidence, at least with great probability, ascribed to her influence over Richard the preference which that monarch finally evinced for the interests of John. Notwithstanding the foul treachery and re bellion of the latter prince, she had obtained his pardon, and had taught him to regain * \"Quid mali tibi feci quare me intremisti? Cui ille respondit.

[a.d. 1199. 184 tion threatened by a far more formidable rival than the feeble boy whom he had despoiled of his hereditary right. This was the same prince, Philippe Auguste of France, with whom he had formerly been in an ini- quitous confederacy against his own brother; and who, in his unscrupulous ambition, now wanted not the inducement of revenging the double perfidy by which that wicked alliance had been formed and broken, to become the minister of retributive justice against him. Richard was no sooner dead than Philippe Auguste, whose spirit had quailed before the impetuous valour of the \" lion-hearted king,\" at once perceived and seized the advantage with which the struggle for mastery might be renewed against his cowardly successor. The king of France found a ready pretence for forwarding his ambitious projects, by declaring himself the protector of young Arthur. Though the duchies of Normandy and Aquitaine had submitted to John, the people of Anjou and its dependencies, as the patrimonial fiefs of the house of Plantagenet, had declared for the legitimate heir of their princes ; and his mother Constance had committed his cause and person into the hands of Philippe, as lord paramount. That monarch used the ill-fated boy as a mere tool for the further- ance of his own selfish ends: alternately abandoning and supporting him in the in- tervals of war and negotiation with his perfidious uncle. But it is unnecessary to relate at length in this place the series of events by which Philippe Auguste was enabled finally to sever the ducal coronet of Normandy from the crown of England, and which belong more properly to the reign of that prince, and to the history of France. We need here only refer gener ally to the principal circumstances, forming so many descending steps, as it were, m the scale of disgrace and infamy, by which John suffered dominions, won and retained by the good swords of his bold ancestors, to be wrested from his usurping and feeble grasp. These, as we have else where seen, were his own pusillanimous and the confidence of his injured brother; and by a real or pretended* testament, executed on his death-bed, Richard is said to have bequeathed to John the whole of his do minions and three-fourths of his treasures : desiring that the remaining fourth might be \u00a9 DO distributed among his servants and the poor; and that his jewels might be given to his nephew Otho, emperor of Germany. As the queen-mother was still deemed to hold the investiture of her extensive paternal fiefs of Guienne and Poitou, which, as duchess of Aquitaine, she had brought to her husband, she now solemnly transferred her rights to her surviving son ; f and in those provinces, as well as in Normandy, the title of John was acknowledged without opposition. In England some show of resistance was at first attempted by many of the nobility who had formerly opposed his treasonable designs; and who now, either dreading his vengeance or detesting his character, appeared deter mined to maintain the superior right of Arthur. But the primate Hubert, the power ful earl of Pembroke, and the justiciary Fitz- Peter, the principal ministers of Richard, were enlisted in the cause of John ; and aided by the respect which was paid to the late king's will, whether genuine or ficti tious, these great officers succeeded in over coming the reluctance of their peers. Upon condition that they should not be disturbed in their existing possessions and rights, the barons of England agreed to accept John for their sovereign; and hastening from Normandy, that prince was crowned with the usual ceremonies at Westminster. | But, meanwhile, the new king of England found the security of his continental usurpa- * The authenticity of Richard's testamentary disposition has sometimes been questioned : but Hoveden, a contem porary, and in general extremely well informed, explicitly states the provisions without casting any doubt upon them. \" Cum autein rex de vita desperarit, divisit Johanni, fratri suo, regnum Angli\u00e6 et omnes alias terras tuas ; \" and he adds to the particulars in the text, that Richard caused those who were present to swear allegiance to John. \" Fecit fieri pra dicto Johanni fidelitates ab iis qni aderant, et pr\u00e6cepit ut traderentur ei castella sua,\" &c. p. 449. t In a curious convention between John and his mother (Rymer, vol. i. p. 113) he declares her transfer of Poitou and its dependencies to him unde homagium nostrum recepit, and restores the provinces to her for life. | Hoveden, pp. 450, 451.

This mere empty form of feudal judgment might indeed have proved harmless even against John, if it had not been preceded by his own reck less or cowardly abandonment of his Norman vassals, which had compelled the faithful capital of the duchy to surrender to the French king. The fall of Rouen was the signal for the complete conquest of Nor mandy; and Philippe Auguste had the glory of re-annexing to the French crown that great province, which the descendants of Polio had proudly held in nominal vassalage but real independence for nearly three cen turies, and which, for one hundred and thirty-eight years, had imposed the victorious succession of its princes and nobles upon the kingdom of England, f The loss of Normandy was followed by a series of events in the shameful career of John which more immediately belong to the domestic history of England, and which, while deepening the personal disgrace of that prince, have rendered the epoch of his reign among the most glorious in our early national annals. By one of those accidents which the papal court was ever on the watch to improve against the distress or imbecility of temporal sovereigns, John became in volved in a quarrel with the church far more dangerous, and to him not less dishon ourable in its result, than his recent contest with the French monarch. The occasion of this rupture with the papacy was afforded by that question of the right of ecclesiastical investitures, which, as we have seen, had already formed so fertile a source of contro versy between the lay and spiritual powers of Europe in the preceding age. In England, though the chapters of cathedral churches claimed the right of electing their bishops, this privilege was modified in practice by the necessity of a previous license and ulti mate approval from the sovereign, which in fact gave to the royal recommendation the weight of a virtual command. In the case \u00a9 of archiepiscopal elections, however, the right was further contested between the suffragan bishops and the chapter; and on the death of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, in the year after the loss of Normandy, these con flicting pretensions were brought to an issue. * Dr. Lingard (Hist, of England, vol. iii. p. 15) thinks that u if it were possible to consult some contemporary histo rian, we might discover the true reasons of John's inactivity ; \" and he quotes Matthew of Westminster and Matthew Paris in proof that the English barons refused to embark with their sovereign at Portsmouth for NormaDdy. The former chro nicler, however, only says that John \" apud Portesmue in Anglia applicuit, et suos des\u00e6viens, occasiones cavillatorias fing%ns, quod in partibus transmariniseum destitutum militia deseraerunt, extorsit ex iis infinitam pecuniam.\" Matt. Westmonast. Flores Historiarum (Ed. Fraucofurti, 1601), p. 265. Again, in Matthew Paris, the only passages bearing on the question which we can discover in the pages (175, 176) cited by Dr Lingard, are the following: \u2014 \" Comites vero, et barones et alii de regno Angli\u00e6 nobiles, qui eatenus hdeliter adh\u00e6serant, talia andientes, ejusque desidiam incor rigibilem intelligentes, impetrata licentia quasi ilico reversuri, remearunt ad propria.\" And afterwards at Portsmouth, \" Deinde in comites et barones, occasiones pretendens qnod ipsnm inter hostes reliquerant in partibus transmarinis, &c , cepit ab eis septimam pattern omnino mobilium suorum.\" To us, we confess, the pusillanimous or apathetic inactivity of John at this period of his reign, appears too much in unison with the whole course of his life to require any special expla nation of its reasons ; and it seems much more consonant with his character, that he should seek any pretext for extorting money from his feudal tenants, than that their desertion, and not his wilful misconduct, was the cause of his disgrace. t It is both remarkable and unfortunate that, at the period on which we are now about to enter, comprising the domestic transactions of John's reign, and forming, as it does, one of the most interesting in our early English history, we are deserted by all the contemporary native chroniclers, whose works have afforded so rich a mine of evidence. The valuable history of Roger Hoveden closes with the year 1201 ; that of Radulfus de Diceto at the accession of John ; that of Grrvase with the death of Richard I. To this list of contemporary writers, Dr. Lingard (vo'. iii. p. 12) adds the name of Brompton : but as the learned Selden has shown in his Introduction to the Col lection of Twysden, Brompton, though his chronicle ends at the accession of John, could not have lived until at least a century later ; for in tracing the genealogy of the Scottish kings (col. 967) he carries it down to \" David regem Scoti\u00e6 cui rex Angli\u00e6, Edwardus a conquestu tertius, sororem suam Johannam maritavit.\" From this epoch, however, our best guides are the two monks, Matthew Paris of St. Alban's and Matthew of Westminster ; of whom neither was exactly con temporary with the reign before us, while both appear to have copied from a common source, probably the meagre chronicle of Roger Wendover. The former was still in his infancy at the death of Richard I. ; the latter, who terminates his nar rative with the year 1307, flourished rather in the next age. _4"], [224, "[a.d. 1207. 186 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. whose acknowledged abilities he had already rewarded with a cardinal's hat, and whose attachment therefore to the interests of the papacy he had no reason to doubt. But as some form of election by the chapter of Canterbury was still necessary, he compelled the canons who had been deputed to Rome to give their votes to Langton, under pain of excommunication ; and having thus wrung from them a reluctant assent, he wrote to John a complimentary letter, which was designed to soothe that monarch into sub mission to so audacious an usurpation.* But without awaiting an answer, he himself proceeded to consecrate Langton archbishop of Canterbury. John was no sooner ac quainted with these measures of Innocent III. than he gave loose to his indignation in acts of violence, by which his wily antago nist had probably expected, from his char acter, that he would injure his own cause; and which, in any case, proved that his temper, equally mean and tyrannical, was incapable of asserting with dignity even the most defensible prerogatives of his crown. Suspecting the remaining members of the chapter of Canterbury of a disposition to yield to the papal commands, he expelled them with the rudest insults from their house, seized their revenues, and banished them from the kingdom. The pope had then recourse, first to expostulation, next to menaces : he commanded John to receive Langton as primate, and to restore the canons to their rights and property ; and he charged the bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester to warn him that his continued disobedience would be followed by a sen tence of interdict against his kingdom. But John, when those prelates threw themselves on their knees before him to entreat his submission, repulsed them with the coarsest oaths, invectives, and insults ; threatened them and the whole body of the clergy with * In Rymer, vol. i. p. 139, is another letter, accompanied by a present of four rings, in which Innocent, as Hume has remarked (Hist, of England, vol. ii. p. 218), by sundry alle gorical conceits, \"endeavoured to repay John for one of the most important prerogatives of his crown which he had ravished from him.\" But the letter itself does not even allude to the subject of Langton's elevation. Some of the younger monks or canons of the cathedral chapter of the see, secretly assembling on the intelligence of that event, without awaiting the royal license, chose Reginald, their sub-prior, to fill the vacant primacy ; and anticipating the opposition both of the king and bishops to this irre gular election, they immediately despatched Reginald himself furtively to Rome to solicit the papal confirmation. As success depended upon the concealment of this intrigue, they enjoined the archbishop-elect to keep the object of his journey a profound secret: but the discretion of Reginald was not proof against his vanity; he everywhere on his route proclaimed his elevation ; and the re ceipt of the intelligence in England filled the king himself, the suffragan bishops, and the senior canons of Canterbury with a com mon indignation. Even the authors of the plot, on its premature detection, were either so enraged at the bad faith and folly of Reginald, or grew so ashamed of the part which they had acted, that they concurred in the necessity of annulling their first choice. On a new and formal election the bishop of Norwich was, by the royal recommenda tion, raised to the archiepiscopal throne; and a deputation of the chapter was sent to Rome to obtain a ratification of this proceeding.* But the bold and able pontiff who now filled the chair of St. Peter saw in the dispute too favourable an opportunity of as serting the unbounded supremacy of papal authority, to confirm the election of either pretender. He declared that of the first uncanonical, and that of the second equally void because it had preceded his sentence; and he determined to place a third person of his own selection in the vacant see. This was Stephen Langton, an Englishman by blood, of high character, but of foreign education, * Matthew Paris, pp. 178, 179. Matthew Westminster, p. 266. In Rymer, vol. i p. 138, is a curious circular letter, unnoticed by our historians, from John to several of the English bishops, dated in May, 1205, desiring them to unite in remonstrances, which five of their brethren had already addressed to the pope, pro dignitate nostrd et regni noslri conservanda, probably with reference to this affair of the archiepiscopal election."], [225, "a.d. 1208.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 187 exile and confiscation ; and spurned them from his presence.* cumstance carried symptoms of the deepest distress, and of the most immediate apprehen sion of divine vengeance and indignation.\" The gloom and horror with which such a deprivation of all the cheering influences of religion could not fail to overwhelm a de vout and superstitious nation, may be readily imagined; but the short-sighted and heart less king, by assuming an air of gay un concern amidst the general distress, seemed resolved to attract to himself the hatred of the people, as the unfeeling author of suffer ings, which they were taught to attribute to his violence and obstinacy. He ordered all the estates of the clergy who observed the interdict to be confiscated; threw the rela tives of the three bishops into prison; and avowed his resolutions of vengeance against D \u00a9 all the adherents either of the new arch bishop of Canterbury or of the pope himself. In this temper he continued for some years to brave the consequences of the interdict; and he even chose the same period for undertaking several enterprises against the Scotch, Irish, and Welsh, in all of which, though the events themselves were not of sufficient importance to arrest our attention in this place, his superior force obtained more success than he experienced in any other martial passages of his inglorious life.* After this, wdien Innocent had affected, by a decent season of suspense, to invite the repentance of John, the three bishops by his order solemnly promulgated the appall- ing sentence which laid the whole kingdom o \u00a9 under an interdict; and then immediately consulted their own safety by flight to the Continent. It required no ordinary courage in those days to brave the papal sentence of excommunication. \" The execution of this sentence was calculated to strike the senses in the highest degree, and to operate with irresistible force on the superstitious minds of the people. The nation was of a sudden deprived of all exterior exercise of its reli- gion : the altars were despoiled of their ornaments : the crosses, the reliques, the images, the statues of the saints, were laid on the ground; and, as if the air itself were profaned, and might pollute them by its contact, the priests carefully covered them up, even from their own approach and veneration. The use of bells entirely ceased in all the churches: the bells themselves were removed from the steeples, and laid on the ground with the other sacred uten- sils. Mass was celebrated with shut doors, and none but the priests were admitted to that holy institution. The laity partook of no religious rite, except baptism to new- born infants, and the communion to the dying: the dead were not interred in con- secrated ground : they were thrown into ditches, or buried in common fields, and their obsequies were not attended with prayers or any hallowed ceremony. Mar- riage was celebrated in the churchyards; and that every action in life might bear the marks of this dreadful situation, tbe people were prohibited the use of meat, as in Lent or times of the highest penance ; were debarred from all pleasures and entertainments, and even to salute each other, or so much as to shave their beards and give any decent atten tion to their person and apparel. Every cir- But such advantages could form no coun terpoise against the increasing perils of the greater conflict with the papacy; and Inno cent III., though from policy slow to resort to the last and most fatal weapons in the spiritual armoury, was not of a character to be resisted with impunity, or arrested in his purpose. Finding John continued unmoved by the interdict, he pointed the next shaft in the papal quiver, and struck him with a sentence of excommunication. The effects of this anathema were immediately felt : the very servants of the crown slunk away from the court to avoid incurring the penalties of intercourse with an excommunicated prince; and one of them, Geoffrey, archdeacon of \u2022 Matt.

[a.d. 1213. 188 hand, John at first pretended to meet the threatened storm of invasion with unflinch ing resolution. He required the sheriffs of every county by writ to summon to the Kentish coast, under pain of incurring the legal forfeiture of personal liberty and pro perty, not only the tenants in chief and sub feudatories of the crown, but all freemen capable of bearing arms, for the defence of the kingdom ; and so numerous was the attendance, that .there was easily selected from the whole multitude a force thoroughly equipped in mail of no less than sixty thou sand men: sufficient, in the words of the chronicler, had they been bound by love to their liege lord, to have defied all the princes of the earth. But while he feigned to put a bold countenance upon his danger, the dastardly heart of John was shaken with inward terror; he was conscious of the dis affection and hatred of his own subjects ; he looked around in vain for foreign succour; and he began to repent, too late, that he had not averted the impending danger by an earlier submission to the papacy. Mean while Innocent, appreciating all the true abjectness of his spirit, had instructed Pan dolfo, his legate or at least confidential minister at the French court, to choose this crisis for practising upon his cowardice. While John was at Dover in daily dread of the appearance of the French armament, Pandolfo sent over, by the mouth of two knights Templars, to desire permission to visit him there : which being readily granted, the wily Italian depicted to him in colours so alarming the perils which were about to overwhelm him from the formidable pre parations of Philippe Auguste, the secret league already concluded by most of his own barons with that monarch, and the certainty that their revolt would be followed by the general defection of the nation to whom he had made himself odious, that the grovelling tyrant was terrified into the fullest submis sion to the papal will* Norwich, an officer of the Exchequer, no sooner heard of the sentence than he rose from the bench, and abdicated his functions. This action provoked the special vengeance of John, who, throwing him into prison, affected a fiendlike merriment at his expense : for declaring that he should not want the vestments of his order to keep him warm in his dungeon, the tyrant caused his victim to be wrapt in a sheet of lead shaped like a long cope, or ecclesiastical mantle, and in that state to be left without food until he expired under the weight. Hitherto the papal de nunciations with which John was visited had served only to exasperate him into acts of wanton ferocity; but these in themselves assisted the purpose of the pope even more effectually than the censures of the church ; and in the universal aversion and horror with which all classes of the nation began to regard their brutal and despicable sove reign, Innocent saw that the time was now arrived for fulminating against him the ex treme sentence of spiritual and temporal condemnation. He therefore proceeded with great solemnity to declare all persons excom municate who should remain in his service or society either public or private; absolved his vassals and subjects in general from their oaths of fealty and allegiance ; and pronoun cing his deposition, concluded by offering his dominions to his old enemy the king of France, for the reward of so pious a service as the execution of that sentence. * Philippe Auguste had himself, perhaps, of all monarchs of his age, the strongest motives, from his own experience, for dis countenancing those audacious pretensions by which Innocent III. openly aspired to elevate his authority over all the temporal thrones of the universe. But he was seduced by his ambition to become the ready instru ment and the final dupe of the pontiff. He eagerly entered into the proposal of Innocent for the deposition of John and the conquest of England ; expended an immense treasure in preparations; and collected a great fleet and army for the enterprise. On the other He was, in the first place, compelled by Pandolfo to sign an instrument, which he * Matt. Paris, p. 195. Matt. West, pp 270,271. * Matt. Paris, pp. 196, 197. Matt.

Upon these conditions the sentences of interdict and excommunication were to be removed, and the bishops of the realm were to renew their oaths of allegiance to the king.* But before this absolution should be granted, Pandolfo was resolved to complete the full ignominy of John's degradation and the in solent triumph of the papacy. The craven king was required, as a proof of his duteous submission to the pope, to resign his king dom itself to the holy see ; and accordingly, on the day after his conference with Pan dolfo, in the church of the Templars at Dover, and before the assembled barons, knights, and people he made a public sur render by charter of his kingdoms of Eng land and Ireland to God, St. Peter, and St. Paul, and to Innocent and his lawful suc cessors. He agreed to hold these dominions in fee, as a vassal of the Roman church, by the annual payment of one thousand marks, seven hundred for England and three hun dred for Ireland ; and he immediately, before the papal representative, performed the same homage, and vowed precisely the same oath of fealty to the pope, which every liegeman was wont, by the feudal customs, to take to his temporal lord. At the conclusion of this ignominious ceremony, John, as an earnest of his subjection to the papacy, laid some coin before Pandolfo, who insolently tramp led the tribute money under his feet.f Aster the completion of this act of stu pendous baseness, as it has well been termed, the legate re-crossed the channel ; waited upon the French king; coolly felicitated him upon the successful termination of the quar rel, in which his zeal for the service of the Holy See had induced him to engage ; and informed him that as John, acknowledging his guilt, had become the vassal, and secured the pardon and protection of the pope, the further use of temporal arms would be neither requisite nor lawful. Philippe Auguste was filled with indignation at this discovery of the perfidious manner in which, after incurring an enormous expense, his interests had been sacrificed, and his ambi tion overreached by the arts of papal policy. It is not improbable that, in spite of the menaces of Innocent, he might have pur sued his enterprise if the legate had not skilfully diverted his thoughts into another channel, and pointed to an object against which his mighty armament might be di rected with scarcely less hope of gain than even if it were still permitted to make an attempt on England. The province of Flanders, by its unriv alled commercial industry and its consequent superior wealth, had already become the admiration and the envy of every neighbour \" homage to Pandolfo as the pope's representative is not mentioned by any ancient writer, and is contradicted by the king's charter.\" Now, 1. Matt. Westminster expressly says (p. 271), \" Resignavit igitur coronam Angli\u00e6 Innocentio pap\u00e6 et ei fecit bomagium,\" &c, which could only be done to his representative. 2. Matt. Paris (whom Dr. Lingard himself quotes in the same note), after (p. 199) making John declare in his charter \" secundum subscriptam formam fecimus et juravimus et homagium ligium in pr\u00e6sentia Pan dulphi,\" says, \" continuo cunctis videntibus homagium fecit subscriptum ; \" aud adds the fact, which Dr. Lingard has chosen altogether to omit, \" Pandulphus autem peenniam quam in arrham suljectionis rex contulerat, sub pede suo conculcavit.\" 3. In the chronicle of Melrose, which was continued by a succession of writers, a monkish annalist, who was doubtless contemporary with the event, declares that John \" coronam etiam regni sub pedibns legati ponendam exhibuit.\" Chronica de Mailros, p. 187 (apud Gale et Fell, Rerum Anglicarum Scriptorum Veteruin, vol. i.

We are not a little astonished to find that Dr. Lingard, who (vol. iii. pp. 42 45) has put in an elaborate plea to extenuate the infamy of John in this abject submission to the Church of Rome, should, in a preceding note (p. 40), assert that the fact of John's having done"], [228, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1211-1213. 190 ing state. From its manufactures the whole \u00a9 north of Europe was supplied with clothing; and the extent of its marine and the skill of its navigators rendered its magazines the \u00a9 \u2014 \u25a0 great emporium, as its ships were the chief carriers of almost the entire world. The pillage of such a country as this was an alluring bait to the cupidity of the French nobles; and their pride would be scarcely less gratified than their avarice, by the punishment of a rabble of merchants, who affected a growing independence upon feudal usages and government, and who, elated by a rapid accumulation of wealth, dared inso lently to mate themselves with the high born members of an ancient and haughty aristocracy. A cause of quarrel was readily at hand. The inheritance of the county of Flanders had passed by marriage to Ferrand or Ferdinand of Portugal, when in 1211 he received the hand of Jeanne, daughter of that Baldwin IX. whom a singular caprice of fortune in the fourth Crusade had elevated to the short-lived and perilous dignity of emperor of Constantinople. These nuptials were contracted without the consent of the Flemish states, and during the misunder standing which ensued, Louis, the son of Philippe Auguste, forcibly possessed him self of the towns of St. Omer and Aire, to which he asserted a claim in right of his mother. Ferrand, justly irritated at this usurpation, refused attendance with the other vassals of France in their assembly at Soissons, unless his cities were restored; and on a subsequent visit to the French court, he protested against the intended war with England as unjust, and declined parti cipation in it out of respect to a former alliance with John. Little more than the artful suggestion of Pandolfo was wanting to determine Philippe upon advancing this act of disobedience as a plea for the invasion of the count's rich and flourishing territory. He ordered Ferrand to quit his court at the instant, and swore fervently by all the saints that thenceforward either France should be come Flanders, or Flanders France.* The fleet destined against England re ceived immediate orders to proceed to the reduction of Gravelines* and Dam, while Philippe, at the head of his troops, captured and pillaged Cassel, Ypres, and Bruges. Afterwards, during the investment of Gand, the king received intelligence that the vic torious division of his army which garri soned Dam was already in turn exposed to siege by Count Ferrand; that half of his fleet had been captured by the English, and that the remaining half was strictly block aded in the port of the beleaguered town. By a forced march he succeeded in reliev ing the garrison and compelling Ferrand to withdraw, but the extrication of the fleet was hopeless; and in order to prevent it from becoming a prey to the English, he was reduced to the desperate necessity of burning it with his own hands ;f a loss and a disgrace which was ill compensated by the savage committal of Dam to a similar de struction. The remainder of the campaign was signalized by cruel and wanton revenge. Gand purchased immunity at an exorbitant ransom; Oudenarde, Courtrai, Douai, and Lille, opened their gates at the first sum mons; and upon intelligence that Count Ferrand was hastening to the reconquest of the last-named city, its walls and citadel were razed to the ground, the town itself was fired, and the miserable inhabitants who attempted escape from the conflagration were either put to the sword on the spot, or sold as slaves. Leaving a fearful memorial of his severity in the unhappy country which he had invaded, Philippe then returned upon the Seine, and disbanded his army. The resentment awakened in the Flemish by their recent sufferings, and by the disaf fection from their new master, which John well knew existed in his own lost provinces in France, soon enabled him to construct a formidable league against Philippe Auguste. * A town which William of Brittany describes in a single emphatic line, \" Quo valde speciosus erat Dam nomine vicus.\" He afterwards proceeds, however, at greater length, and in less bald Latin, to notice its extraordinarv commercial pros perity Philippeis, ix. 387, &c * Matt.

Against the latter Philippe determined to make head in person, while he intrusted the conduct of the campaign on the Loire to his son, Prince Louis. John was in the first instance successful, for no adversary opposed him in the field. No sooner, however, did Louis advance, than the king of England, with his customary fickleness and timidity, avoided battle, and retired towards the coast. The French prince also, deceived by the report of his spies, who greatly exaggerated the numbers of his opponents, hesitated as he approached the English camp; and during a few hours the two armies, which had never yet been in sight of each other's ranks, were in full retreat on opposite quar ters. Louis was the first who received cor rect intelligence, and hastening to retrieve o \u00a9 his mistake, he resumed his advance, pressed with a harassing pursuit upon the fugitives, recovered all the towns which John had captured, and terminated the campaign be fore the arrival of midsummer, with the full fruits of victory gathered without the hazard of a single battle. But even before he had closed his inglo rious career of foreign warfare by a truce with the French king, John had now entered upon that domestic contest against his own subjects, in which he was to undergo yet deeper humiliation. To explain the origin of a quarrel so calamitous to him, but preg nant with consequences so memorable and beneficial to the freedom and fortunes of our country, some retrospect may appear neces sary to the outrageous and arbitrary charac ter both of his government and of that of his predecessors. But in a reference to the features of the feudal system in England, we have already elsewhere briefly noticed the rapacious tyranny under which the aris tocracy were held in subjection by our Nor man sovereigns : the general causes through which the resistance of the royal vassals to the grievous yoke of the Crown savoured the growth of national liberty, may be more appropriately considered hereafter in some inquiry into the rise of the British constitu tion ; and our attention in this place will therefore be confined more immediately to a narrative of those principal occurrences in the reign before us, which attended the great crisis of the struggle. Ever since he ascended the throne, John had but too well justified the appreciation of his worthless character, which experience had taught the English barons to form before his accession. Twice already during his reign, under one pretence or other, had he violently seized on portions of all their moveables ;* while indi vidually they found themselves the constant victims of every rapacious extortion which could be invented by the abuse of the feudal customs or by the personal caprice of the tyrant.

[a.d. 1214. blest families in the realm, were naturally felt as still more unpardonable outrages ; and these may accordingly be numbered as the principal causes of the hatred entertained against him by his barons, many of whom among their other personal wrongs had to revenge the disgrace of their wives and daughters* When we consider that these injuries were sustained at the hands of a prince, equally odious for his cruelties and despicable for his cowardice, who was more than suspected of the murder of his nephew, and had betrayed his craven incapacity to defend the fair inheritance of his house, it may rather excite our astonishment that his tyranny was so long and tamely endured by high-spirited men with arms in their posses sion, than that it provoked their final revolt. But it was the abjectness of his submission to the pope which seems at last to have filled up the measure of public contempt, and to have instructed the barons of England how to extort from his fears that redress for their own and the national grievances, which they could hope to obtain by no other means. ment if its truth were not proved, he was thrown in chains into the dungeon of Corse Castle to abide the event. Meanwhile the king, on whose anxious and wavering mind dread of this ominous prophecy might not, among other causes, have been without its influence, made his submission to the pope on the eve of the Ascension ; and as soon as this festival had passed, he condemned Peter as a false prophet, and ordered not only him, but his son with him, to be dragged at horses' tails to the town of Wareham, and there hanged on a gibbet. This cruel sen- tence was executed; but its justice was im- pugned by the superstition of the age less as an act of mean and vindictive passion, than because it was believed that John's surren- der of the crown to the pope had verified the prediction.* As if desirous of repaying himself, by the oppression of his own subjects, for the sacrifices of dignity and treasure which had been wrung from him by the papal see, John sought the first pretence of exercising his vengeance against the tenants of the crown, for a refusal on their part to follow him on an expedition to the French coast beyond the term or conditions of their feudal ser- vice. Returning from his abortive enter prise, he gave full vent to his fury against them ; and collecting a large body of troops, he openly avowed his purpose of punishing their disobedience with military execution upon their persons and estates. But the barons, anticipating his malignity and con federating for their defence, had now found a leader or adviser competent to the occa sion. This was Cardinal Stephen Langton, the new archbishop of Canterbury, whom the pope had forced upon the king \u2014 a man whose memory, as the historian Hume has well remarked, though he was obtruded on the nation by a palpable encroachment of the see of Rome, ought always to be respected by the English. Whatever were the motives of the primate \u2014 and though the same writer has attempted to analyze them with a seve rity of judgment which never slept when the conduct of a churchman was to be arraigned, Yet the final aggression came not from the barons, but from John himself. For no sooner had he, by an ignominious submis sion, averted the perilous hostility and obtained the powerful protection of the pope, than, together with his sense of secu rity, he recovered all the insolence of his nature, and resumed his arbitrary and tyran nical policy. The first new victim of his tyranny was a wretched fanatic or impostor, Peter, a hermit in Yorkshire, whose story is curious. Pretending to the gift of prophecy, he had foretold, among other predictions which made a strong popular sensation, that the king should lose his crown before Ascen sion Day. John, in great alarm, sent for him; and the man, persisting in his asser tion, and offering to undergo any punish- * \" Erant insuper hac tempestate,\" says Matthew Taris (p. 1 95), \" multi nobiles in regno Angli\u00e6. quorum rex uxores et filiasillis murmurantibus oppresserat.\" And again (p. 205), \" Ipse rex nihilominus multos procerum suorum zelotipavit violenter ; ac filias corrupit nobiles et sorores.\" And Matthew West, \" Se mult is exosum pr\u00e6buit, cum propter mortem nepo tis sui Arthuri, turn propter suam incontinentiam, qua f\u0153dus lecti matrimonialis dirnpit,\" _c , p. 270. * Matt.

After John sailed for the French coast, Langton had an opportunity of meeting the barons in a council which had been convoked at St. Albans by the royal authority, to assess the amount of compensation due to the clergy for the plunder of their property during the inter dict ; and here were doubtless arranged those measures of resistance against the future tyranny of the crown, of which the fruits were shortly visible.* For, when John, on his return to the kingdom, put his forces in motion against the barons, he was met by the primate, who boldly declared that, if he violated his late oath by attempt ing to punish his vassals without legal trial by their peers, it would be his own duty to excommunicate all persons, with the sole exception of the king himself, who should assist in such oppression. John, with his usual irresolution and timidity, suffered himself to be intimidated by this menace ; abandoned his meditated vengeance; and shortly afterwards sailed on his last disgrace ful expedition to Poitou.f The interval of this second absence was diligently improved by Langton. At an other council, held at St. Paul's in London, ostensibly for the same purpose as the last, he took some of the principal barons aside, and showed them a copy of the charter of Henry I., which he declared had just been found,* and according to the provisions of which it would be easy, if they chose, to re claim many ancient and long violated liber tics. When he read this instrument, the barons joyfully testified their assent to his suggestion; swore on the spot to contend, if necessary unto the death, for the assertion of their common rights ; and accepted from the primate the assurance of his aid and support to their confederacy. A similar scene was soon after renewed with more solemnity at St. Edmund's Bury, where under the plea of celebrating the feast of that saint, a more numerous assemblage of barons was obtained ; and where, encou raged by the increasing strength of their association, the confederates, advancing to the high altar, severally took an oath that, if the king refused to concede the required laws and liberties, they would withdraw their allegiance, and wage war against him until he should confirm their rights by charter ; that they would meanwhile prepare their horses and arms ; and that, after the approaching festival of Christmas they would repair in a body to his court to present their demands. John, who had now but just returned from the Continent, proceeded to celebrate the sacred season at Worcester ; whence, the design of the confederates hav ing probably transpired, he suddenly made a hasty retreat to London, and took asylum in the house of the Templars. To the capi tal the barons immediately followed him in strong array, and formally required his con- * Paris dates the troubles, which were now arising, from the death at this crisis of the Justiciary Fitz-Peter, whom he calls the firmest support of the state, and by whose decease he declares that England was left as a tempest-tossed vessel without a rudder. John both feared and hated so powerful and upright a minister ; and the chronicler relates the follow ing characteristic story of the king's joy at the loss of a faithful servant, whose influence had mitigated the effects of his own excesses. \" Cum dicti Petri mors Regi Johanni nun ciaretur, cachinnando dixit : ' Cum venerit in Infernum salutet Hubertum Cantuar. arehiepiscopum, quern procul dubio ibi inveniet.* Et conversus in circumsedentes, subin tulit dicens, ' Per pedes Domini ! nunc primo sum rex et dominus Angli\u00e6.' \" Matt.

Paris, p. 201. \u2022 The extant charter of Henry I. does not contain many provisions which appeared in the deed produced by Langton ; and Mr. Hallam (vol. ii. p. 443), with great probability has 11 ventured to suspect a pious fraud of Archbishop Langton, the producer of this pretended charter, who might have fab ricated an instrument in the name of Henry, containing some of those privileges which the barons were then about to ex tort from his successor.\" By the way it may be remarked that Hume, in making Langton declare that he had happily found a copy of the charter of Henry I. in a monastery, goes beyond his authority : for the words of the archbishop in Matthew Paris are only, \" Inventa est quoque nunc charta qu\u00e6dam Henrici primi Regis Angli\u00e6, per quam si volueritis,\" &c. Such is the easy growth of the circumstantial fictions in which all history abounds! 25"], [232, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1214. 194 firmation of the laws of the Confessor and of Henry I. Alarmed at the formidable aspect of the confederacy, John, after vainly affect ing a high tone of authority, sank to the meanness of subterfuge; and pleading the necessity of time for the consideration of demands so weighty, he promised to return a satisfactory reply at the ensuing Easter, and proposed the primate himself, and Wil liam, earl of Pembroke, great marshal of the realm, as his sureties for the performance of this engagement. With some reluctance \u00a9 \u00a9 the barons granted the delay, accepted its conditions, and peaceably withdrew to their fortresses.* reparation were altogether put aside, the bishops in lieu of the sum of one hundred thousand marks which the king, in despair of satisfying more enormous demands, had himself offered, were compelled by the pope's award to accept of forty thousand. A re newal of the homage and payment of the tribute to the pope, by which John had bound himself, proclaimed at once his gra titude for these favours, the price at which they were purchased, and the grovelling state of dependence by which he was pre pared to secure the continuance of the papal protection.* To Innocent, therefore, John now ap pealed in his emergency against the demands of the barons, and solicited the powerful interference of the pontiff to forbid their prosecution. The barons, on their part, also saw the necessity of propitiating Innocent, and despatched a messenger to Rome to lay their grievances before him, and to entreat that, in his new capacity as feudal lord of the kingdom, he would exert the authority with which he was invested, in common over their sovereign and themselves, for the con firmation of their rights.f But Innocent felt little hesitation which cause to espouse in a quarrel between the pusillanimous prince, on whose subjection he might se curely count, and a body of high-spirited nobles, whose very demands were an earnest of resolves to brook no encroachment on their liberties. While he affected, therefore, to interpose his good offices with the king in their favour, he wrote to them severely reprehending their attempt to extort by force from their sovereign privileges which they should have solicited as acts of his grace. But it was against the primate Langton that his displeasure was most point edly expressed : in a letter to that prelate, he openly rebuked him for his conduct to the king; mentioned in round terms a sus picion that he had fomented the disaffection of the barons ; and commanded him thence- In thus seeking some respite from the importunity of claimants so urgent and powerful, nothing was further from John's intentions than honourably to redeem the pledge which he had given. His only view was to discover the means of evasion ; and the expedient to which he had recourse in his extremity again introduced upon the scene an actor more puissant, or at least more formidable, than either king or barons. This was the sovereign pontiff, whose dis position in the affairs of England had already undergone a change, more characteristic of his ambitious and unscrupulous spirit than creditable to the supreme head and protector of the church. As soon as Innocent III. had completed his triumph over John, he was not slow to perceive that thenceforth he should have more to gain by upholding the disgraced and submissive vassal of the Roman see, than by continuing to foment the discontents of his subjects, or even to sup port against him the claims of the English clergy. When, therefore, a new papal legate, Nicholas, cardinal-bishop of Tusculum, had arrived in the kingdom, with authority to remove the late interdict, and to decide on the compensation due to the exiled clergy for their losses, his judgment, which was promptly confirmed by Innocent himself, had betrayed the most palpable leaning to the interests of John; and while even the just claims of the inferior ecclesiastics to * Matt.

Langton and the English clergy in general were disgusted at the discovery, that Inno cent designed to appropriate to himself all the fruits of the late victory which they had assisted him in gaining for the church ; and the primate in particular, in whom the pat riotic or personal ambition of promoting the cause of his country or the common inde pendence of his own see and of the national church, had superseded his ancient attach ment to the papal court, was least of all disposed to sacrifice these cherished objects to the conflicting interests of the pontiff. their resolution to treat as enemies all who longer hesitated to join their army. Their success and their measures equally deter mined all those members of their order who had hitherto hung back in doubt or fear to join their standard; and in a few days John was left almost alone at Odiham in Hants.* The affrighted and humbled tyrant now concluded that there remained for him no other alternative than dethronement or sub mission. Even if the barons had not man fully resolved to defy the displeasure of the pope, no time was left to invoke the spirit ual arms of the Vatican ; some recent efforts to propitiate the English clergy had been made too late, and were received by that body with silent contempt ; a pretended re solution to take the Cross, that he might secure the protection from all hostile attacks which the church extended to crusaders, had met with no better success; and the primate Langton, since his mission to the baronial camp, had openly shown his savour to the confederates, by not only rejecting the proposal of Pandolfo to excommunicate them, but declaring that, unless John dis missed the bodies of foreign troops whom he had recently introduced into the king dom, he should lay the intruding leaders of those mercenaries under ecclesiastical penal ties, f Dismayed by the general defection, John all at once assented to the demands of the barons, with a readiness in which it would be hard to determine whether his cowardice or insincerity was most con spicuous. In the field of Runnymede, on the Thames, between Staines and Windsor, attended only by a few prelates and nobles, most even of whom took no pains to conceal their adherence to the baronial party, the king met the confederates, who lay there encamped in hostile array ; and on that spot, the scene and the transaction for ever mem orable in English history, was the royal signature and seal set upon the Great Charter of our national liberties. | There can be little doubt, therefore, that the barons still acted under the counsel and secret guidance of this celebrated man when, on the approach of the festival of Easter, they again drew their forces together, and advanced towards the king's court at Ox ford. The primate himself, and the earl marshal of Pembroke, both the destined umpires in a cause of which they conspicu ously promoted the success, were the persons appointed by the king to meet the insur gents and ascertain their demands. When these, which were only a reiteration of their former proposals, were communicated to John, he became furious; swore that he would never grant them liberties which would make him a slave; and endeavoured again to elude a compliance by proposing a final reference to the pope. But the barons now absolutely rejected all compromise, and openly commenced hostilities. Choosing Robert Fitz- Walter for their leader, they proclaimed him general of \" the army of God and of holy church ;\" and after ineffectually besieging the royal castle of Northampton, and receiving the submission of that of \u00a9 Bedford, they advanced to London by invi tation of the principal citizens, took unop posed possession of the capital, and published * Matthew Paris, pp. 213, 214.

Such securities, however, for the protection of the clerical and feudal orders, always sufficiently powerful to assert their own rights and even to violate those of the people below them, would have produced little per- manent advantage to the cause of national liberty, if the demands of the barons had been confined to these enactments; and the most valuable clauses of the Great Charter are those which they generously obtained to guard the persons and property of all freemen. They obliged the king to declare that he would neither sell, nor refuse, nor delay right or justice to any one; that no freeman should be arrested, nor imprisoned, nor deprived of his lands, nor outlawed, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or the law of the land; neither should he be amerced above such measure of his offence and of his ability to pay,* as the oaths of the good men of his neighbourhood should assess . Further, it was provided that traders should not be oppressed by arbitrary imposts, and that they and all freemen should be allowed to pass out of the realm and return to it at their will ; that one weight and measure should be established throughout the king- Q \u00a9 dom ; that the court of Common Pleas should be stationary, instead of following the king's person as heretofore ; and that the itinerant justices of assize should be sent into every county regularly once a year. Some of the worst grievances of the laws and customs relating to the royal forests and the exaction of purveyance for the wants of the royal establishment were to be redressed ; and all ancient immunities and liberties enjoyed by the inhabitants of London and every The nature of this famous instrument has alternately been misrepresented, as if it had redressed only the feudal grievances of the baronage, or had embodied the matured principles of constitutional freedom. A simple enumeration of the contents of Magna Charta will be sufficient to disprove the accuracy of either assumption. So far from being selfishly confined to the security of their own feudal order, the demands of the barons had comprehended an equal assertion of legal immunities for themselves, the clergy, and the whole body of the free commonalty of the land : but we shall look in vain, as indeed it would be absurd to seek in any enactment of so rude an epoch, for those formal declarations of right, or those jealous provisions of constitutional law, which it was reserved for more advanced stages of society to enunciate, and for the growth of ages to perfect. The first article of the Great Charter confirmed the liberties of the church, secured to her members the freedom of ecclesiastical elections, and regu lated the fines to be imposed upon the clergy for civil offences. Next, for the removal of those feudal abuses under which chiefly the tenants of the crown had been oppressed, it was provided that reliefs on succession should be limited to an equitable proportion of the value of each fief; that the wardship of minors and females should not be sold, nor waste committed or suffered by the crown on their inheritance; that wards should not be married in disparagement of their condition, nor widows by compulsion ; and that scutages should be fixed in the same amount which had been customary in the reign of Henry I., and confined, unless levied by the special consent of the great council of prelates and barons, to the recog nized incidents of feudalism. * The same protection may even fairly be said to have extended at least to an order of persons below the condition of freemen ; though it has sometimes been reproached against the framers of the Great Charter that they made no provision for the interests of the serfs or slaves, who formed one of the most numerous classes of the population. But the charter declares that a villein belongLg to other than the king shall only be amerced, saving his waggonage or instruments of hushandry. \"Et villanus alterius quam noster eodem modo amercietur; salvo wannagio, suo,\" &c. Whether the term of villein was synonymous with that of serf, as describing a slave of the soil, is indeed a vexata qu\u0153stio; but it is evident from the context of the charter that villanus is here used in contradistinction from the liber homo, or freeman, whose right is protected by a preceding clause. These and some minor provisions, ex tending to all sub-vassals as well as the tenants in chief of the crown, were calcu lated effectually to remove the pretexts of oppression, whether by the sovereign against the great barons, or by the latter against their dependents, to which any feudal ten-"], [235, "A.d. 1215.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 197 other city, burgh, and seaport, were solemnly confirmed. cheerfulness, and immediately issued writs to the sheriffs of counties, enjoining universal obedience to the baronial conservators. Their objects being thus gained, the con federates hastened to dissolve the assembly and desert the king's court; after appoint ing a tournament to be held at Stamford early in the following month, for the purpose either of celebrating their victory, or of securing its fruits against treachery by the reunion of their forces.* Such, among a variety of clauses of lesser or more temporary importance, were the chief articles of this great and glorious deed, which was to ascertain the rights and privi- leges of all orders of Englishmen ; and the more attentively we consider its provisions, in relation to the rude age and the troubled circumstances which produced them, the higher will rise our respect for the memory of the men by whom they were framed and asserted. We know not whether most to admire, with a great historian,* the moderation of spirit which led the noble confederates, long outraged as they had been by a despicable tyrant, and now flushed with their total victory over him, to leave invio- late all the essential principles, while they swept away the abuses, of the royal preroga- tive ; or the wise and generous policy which extended the benefits of the settlement to all ranks and conditions of freemen ; or, yet, the equally minute and comprehensive fore- thought which embraced, in the contents of a single instrument, so great a variety of useful provisions and safeguards for the common weal. In one respect only may the barons appear to have exceeded the bounds of that temperate regard to the preservation of the regal authority, for which they have been extolled : but here the impossibility of confiding in the honour of their faithless prince, and the necessity of securities for the performance of his engagements, form a sufficient justification for their conduct. They compelled him to invest twenty-five of their number with unlimited authority over the administration of the national affairs, as conservators of the public liberties; to leave the capital and several castles in their hands, until the provisions of the charter should be brought into action ; and to com- mit the Tower of London to the temporary keeping of the primate, as an additional pledge for their fulfilment. f John submit ted to all these demands with apparent The conduct of the king soon abundantly justified their worst suspicions. Under the semblance of an earnest resolution faithfully to execute all the engagements into which he had entered, he had predetermined to violate them with the most deliberate perfidy. Even while he was negotiating with the barons, he had already, a few days before he agreed to meet them, addressed to the pope, from Odiham,f a long letter filled with reproaches against them ; and they had no sooner retired from his presence at Runny mede, than bursting from hypocritical com posure into an uncontrolled paroxysm of fury, he gave full vent to his passions with the wildest extravagance of a maniac. t. From this impotent ebullition of rage he was recalled to calmer purposes of revenge only by the evil suggestions of attendants, whose congenial spirit made them his sole confidential advisers. In the design to overpower his subjects both by spiritual and temporal arms, his agents were privately despatched to the Continent to seek the aid of the pope, and to levy numerous bands of mercenaries; and at the same time secret orders were sent to the foreign officers whom, in violation of the charter, he still retained in his service, to secure and pro vision the royal castles. \u00a7 Though several proofs transpired both of * Matt.

They lost time in vain remonstrances, and suffered themselves to be amused with hollow assurances of good faith,* until the tyTant, repairing to Dover, had been strengthened by the arrival of many thousands of the foreign adventurers, under Sauvery de Mauleone and other leaders, whom he had hired to his standard ; and when, too late, the baronial confederates stood on their defence by throwing a gar rison into the castle of Rochester, John advancing from Dover laid siege to that fortress before it could be adequately sup plied with provisions or warlike stores. Neither were the barons in a condition to attempt its relief; and after a gallant resist ance, famine compelled its surrender. This event was the signal of open civil war: but the large army of foreign mercenaries which John had now succeeded in collecting, was so superior in numbers and organization to the unprepared and scattered forces of the barons, that the contest was altogether unequal. The leaders, indeed, of the baronial confederacy still retained their possession of the capital : but shut up within its walls, they were compelled passively to witness the devastation of the whole sur rounding country; and their ruthless sove reign, penetrating from the southern coast to the Scottish borders, gave up every part of his kingdom which was traversed in his desolating course, to the horrid excesses of his bloodthirsty and rapacious followers, who consigned to the flames the towns and castles of Morpeth, Mitford, Alnwick, and Wark, together with all the villages and hamlets on the road. The names of the leaders of this savage host of mercenaries, the outcasts and freebooters of Europe, \" Buch the Murderer,\" \" Godeschal the Ironhearted,\" \"Falco without Bowels,\" \" Mauleone the Bloody,\" sufficiently indi cate their character. But so far from re straining these ruffians, John even instigated their atrocities ; firing every morning with his own hands the quarters in which he had slept;* allowing the most shocking tortures to be inflicted upon the inhabitants to make them confess where they had concealed their money and valuables ; and abandoning his wretched subjects without mercy to murder, lust, and rapine. From his own dominions he extended his malignant vengeance to those of the young king of Scotland, Alexander II., who had leagued himself with the English barons; and the whole country from the border to the gates of Edinburgh shared the same fate as the more southern parts of the island/f Meanwhile the solicitations of John had received the prompt acquiescence of Inno cent III. ; and the barons found their cause oppressed at once by the united weight of the papal and royal hostility. In the full plenitude of his apostolic and feudal auth ority, Innocent issued a bull in which he annulled the Great Charter upon the several pleas \u2014 that it had been extorted from the king in violation of his own rights as lord paramount; in contempt of the protection under which John had further placed him self by taking the Cross ; and to the impedi ment of the crusade in which he had sworn to embark. He wrote also to the barons, commanding them to return to their alle giance, and to submit their grievances to his tribunal, at which he promised them * \" Domum enim in qua hospitatus est, propria mann, ut dicitur, contra morem regium indecenter accendit \" Mailros, p. 190. The entries in this and other monastic chronicles show that even religious houses did not escape plunder from either foe or friend in the barbarous warfare of the times. The monkish annalist of Melrose, after relating some excess of this kind committed by the Scottish army, records with evident satisfaction that nineteen hundred of them were drowned in crossing a river with their sacrilegious booty, and pithily adds, \" Ultio digna Dei.\" t Matt.

The monk of St. Alban's blames the inaction of the barons in London, accusing them of a forgetfulness of their duties in sensual indulgence, and ridiculing them for mewing themselves up \" more mulierum puerperarum in puerperio jacentium. But it is evident from his own showing, that the force of the king's foreign army was overwhelming. * \" Rex sereno vultu, virus intrinsecum coram magnatibus palliando, se nihil sinistrum meditari jurando per pedes Dei, constanter affirmavit.\" Matt.

But as they did not obey his injunctions, he next desired Langton to excommunicate the refractory; and on the non-compliance of that prelate, he suspended him from the exercise of his episcopal func tions : to which, although the archbishop, submissively proceeding to Rome to attend a general council, there endeavoured to avert his displeasure, he refused to restore him.* Finally, Innocent proceeded to fulmi nate a general sentence of excommunication against the insurgent barons, many of whom were specified by name, and to lay the city of London, together with all the domains of the offenders, under an interdict. f rendered incapable of succeeding to the throne ; while his deposition by the sentence of his French peers on account of his nephew's murder, and his own more recent surrender of the crown to the pope, were urged as further forfeitures and abrogations of his title. But even on these pleas, the existence of her mother and elder sister was in itself sufficient to deprive Blanche of all claim to the English throne; and it would be only a waste of words to expose the futility of the other arguments advanced for a preference, of which the despair of the barons and the power of Louis to relieve them were the real motives.* For a sentence so palpably unjust, not even the superstitious feelings of the age could obtain any respect; and it was received only with universal disregard and contempt. But the condition of the barons in the capital had now become desperate; and in their distress they were driven to a measure of a nature in itself so pregnant with danger to the independence of their country, and with disgrace to their own honour and the righteous cause in which they had united, that before its adoption can be excused, it is necessary to remember the extremity to which they had been reduced. They had, in fact, no alternative but to surrender their lives, liberties, and fortunes, to the sport of a triumphant and remorseless tyrant, or to transfer their allegiance, in exchange for succour and protection, to a foreign master. After much hesitation they offered the crown of England to Louis, the eldest son of the French king. J To justify their choice of that prince, they laboured to invest it with some colouring of hereditary right on behalf of his wife, Blanche, daughter of Eleanor, queen of Castile, John's sister.

It was in vain that the papal legate Gualo personally menaced both his father and himself with excommunication, if they invaded the fief or attacked the vassal of the Holy See. While Philippe Auguste seemed to discountenance the enterprises Louis affected to deny his father's right to restrain him from prosecut ing his wife's claim to a foreign throne ; and immediately departed from his court to embark for England.

But the true reason of the English barons for calling in the French prince rather than any other is pithily stated by the chronicler (antea, p. 234), that John's foreign mercenaries, being chiefly vassals of the French crown, would not fight against the heir of their lord : an anticipation which was fully realized. * Early in the following year, however, the pope so far relented as to remove the sentence of suspension, but only upon condition that the primate should not enter England until after the conclusion of a peace between the king and barons.

Louis bestowed two of the best earldoms of Eng land, those of Winchester and Lincoln, on countrymen of his own ; and the alarm and jealousy excited among the nobility of the kingdom by this preferment of foreigners, was soon increased by a rumour which, whether well or ill founded, was industri ously circulated. This was that the Viscount de Melun, one of Louis' French lords, had been suddenly seized with a mortal malady in London, and had sent for such of the English nobles as had remained in that city. On their arrival at his deathbed the dying man said to them, \" Your fate grieves me; the prince and sixteen of his nobles have bound themselves by oath, when the realm shall be conquered and he shall be crowned, to banish for ever those who have joined his standard, as traitors not to be trusted. Their whole offspring will be beggared or exter minated. Doubt not my words ; I who here lie dying before you was one of the con spirators ; look to your safety.\" This report was whispered everywhere and believed by many.* municated Louis and his followers; and he had already issued his mandate for a similar sentence against Philippe himself, which, on encountering a refusal from the French clergy to promulgate, he would doubtless have fulminated on themselves as well as their sovereign, if his own earthly career had not been terminated by the hand of death.* Before John was thus deprived of his active and formidable protector, Louis, having assembled at Calais a fleet of nearly seven hundred sail, had with some loss from the elements and the desultory attacks of the navy of the Cinque Ports, effected the passage of the Channel and landed his army at Sandwich. John, who was now encamped at Dover with a large force of his foreign mercenaries, had reason to fear that those troops, of whom the majority were subjects of the French king, would go over to the standard of his son; and on the approach of Louis he made a precipitate retreat across the kingdom to Bristol. The French prince, after capturing the castle of Rochester, ad vanced to the capital, was joyfully welcomed by the barons and citizens, and receiving homage as their sovereign, took a solemn oath to protect and govern them according to the good laws of the realm. Meanwhile John was abandoned by all his French and Flemish mercenaries, who, refusing to fight against the heir of their liege lord, either joined that prince or returned home; some Gascon bands, who alone as vassals of the English king still adhered to him, were too few to keep the field ; of the barons who had hitherto followed his standard or observed a dubious neutrality, many now openly transferred their allegiance to his rival ; and the king of Scots, traversing England at the head of his forces, did homage personally in London to Louis. The party of that prince appeared to extend and triumph in every quarter; and already might be antici pated the success of that inauspicious design by which the former conservators of the national liberties had prepared to intrust When by such means distrust was once provoked between Louis and his English followers, numbers began to fall away from his party; John, on his side, was lavish of promises to all who should return to their allegiance;! his cause rapidly recovered ground ; and so dubious became the issue of the balanced contest, that there seemed to remain for the unhappy nation no other prospect than that of a protracted civil war, to be terminated by the equally fatal triumph, either of a foreign conqueror, or of their native oppressor. At this perilous crisis, the kingdom was suddenly delivered from a part of its impending calamities by the only event which could save the national independence and liberties \u2014 the death of the * Matt.

John, who had retired into Norfolk, plundering and burning the country on his march, was now retracing his steps along the sea-coast to face his enemies, when, in passing over the sands between Lynn and Wisbeach, his baggage -train, with all his crown-jewels and treasure, was overtaken and swept away by the violent influx of the tide. Grief at this irretrievable disaster, ao-erravated an illness under which he had CO before laboured, and which was increased by a gluttonous repast on peaches or pears, with an immoderate quantity of new cider. He was seized with fever; and having with difficulty reached the castle of Newark, he there expired three days after his arrival, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his reign. To the causes of his death, if grief and distraction of spirit were insufficient, different authorities have added a suspicion of poison. His end could scarcely be more miserable than his life was flagitious ; but the lineaments of his charac ter have been sufficiently traced in his actions, and we shall be excused for closing with disgust and impatience the dark cata logue of vices, unredeemed by even a soli tary virtue, which have condemned his memory to contempt and execration* CHAPTER VI. henri m. 1216-1272. \u2014 the earl of Pembroke's patriotism \u2014 expulsion of the FRENCH WEAK AND VICIOUS CHARACTER OF HENRY HIS INGRATITUDE TO DE BURGH HIS INVASION OF FRANCE, AND FLIGHT HIS MISGOVERNMENT SIMON DE MONTFORT AND THE BARONS PROVISIONS OF OXFORD BATTLE OF LEWES AND DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS DEFEAT AND DEATH OF DE MONTFORT AT EVESHAM PRINCE EDWARD JOINS THE CRUSADE DEATH OF HENRY. On his deathbed, John had appointed his eldest son Henry, a child only ten years old, to succeed him on the throne, and had dic tated a circular letter to all the royal officers throughout the kingdom, enjoining their obedience to this testament. When he first perceived that his illness was mortal, he had als.o written to the new pope, Honorius III., commending his family to the protection of that pontiff.* But the firmest champion of the tottering throne of the Plantagenets was William, earl marshal of Pembroke, a man of great wisdom, as well as military skill, who, by his services to his country at this dangerous juncture, deserves to be remem bered as the saviour of her national indepen dence; and to whose temperate and upright conduct, may be awarded the highest praise of patriotism. During the troubles and negotiations which preceded the signature of the charter on Runnymede, he appears, in conjunction with Langton, as a mediator between the king and the barons; though he subsequently maintained his allegiance to the tyrant, his fidelity to the cause of legal government was unquestionably proved ; and to his prudence and energy was the king dom mainly indebted for preservation from that foreign yoke, which the resentment or despair of his less scrupulous and less reflecting compeers had well-nigh imposed on themselves and their posterity. After the death of John, the first act of Pem broke was to convey Henry to Gloucester, where, in the presence of the papal legate Gualo and of the prelates and barons who had adhered to his father, he was crowned with the usual solemnities by the bishops of Winchester and Bath.f At * Epist.

In these letters he represented, as John was no more, the injustice of visiting his crimes upon the head of his innocent son; he exposed the danger of intrusting the liberties for which they had fought to the hands of a foreign master, who already slighted their services and transferred their possessions to aliens; and he urged the preservation of the royal title to the young heir of their ancient line of sovereigns, as promising the best security for that of their own rights. These arguments were power fully seconded by the zealous efforts of the papal legate, who made an able and unspar ing use of the influence and weapons of the church ; and by the spiritual censures and excommunications continually launched against Louis and his adherents, the mass of the nobles and people were easily taught to regard as irreligious a cause, which had already become obnoxious to every senti ment both of national antipathy and patriot ism. Numerous accessions were thus daily gained to the party of young Henry; the great earls of Salisbury, Warenne, and Arundel, with many lesser barons and knights, deserted the foreign pretender and offered allegiance to their native sovereign ; and the protector Pembroke was soon in a condition to negotiate a truce, which, if equally necessary to his opponent for the collection of reinforcements from the Conti nent, was employed by the earl to far greater advantage in producing new defections among the English adherents of Louis* When this suspension of arms had expired, Henry's adherents renewed hostilities by in- \u2022 Matt.

West. p. 277. the same time, the guardianship of his per son was committed to the earl marshal, who immediately issued a proclamation in the royal name, appointing a great council to be holden at Bristol, summoning the tenants of the crown there to perform the accus tomed homage to their new sovereign, and promising to all an oblivion of past dissen sions and full security for their liberties in future. In this assembly at Bristol, which was attended by most of the spiritual and by many of the temporal lords of the realm, Pembroke obtained a more formal recogni tion of his authority by election to the office of protector of the kingdom ; and his earliest care in that capacity was to digest and promulgate a royal act for the solemn con firmation, with a few alterations and amend ments, of the great charter of liberties.* The good effects of these wise and con ciliatory measures soon became visible. Louis, who had hailed the death of John as the consummation of his own fortunes, found that event anything but propitious to his cause. His party seemed, indeed, to command a powerful preponderance of num bers and strength; the great majority of the baronial order was still arrayed under his standard; and he held unopposed possession of the capital and all the fortresses of the south, except the royal castle of Dover. But that impregnable stronghold was still defended by the justiciary, Hubert de Burgh, with so much resolution and fidelity to his trust, that the French prince was compelled to raise the siege ; and while the confidence of his followers was weakened by this first reverse, the imprudent preference which he continued openly to betray to his own countrymen increased the growth of that jealousy and disaffection, of which the seeds were already sown among the English barons of his party.

Whde they were engaged in this enterprise, Pembroke summoned all the tenants of the crown to assemble at Newark, and advanced in his turn to attack the confederates; who, deceived by the skdful disposition of his forces, and believing them to be more numerous than they were, unwisely shut themselves up in the town of Lincoln. Here a desultory but decisive conflict ensued. Assailed at once by a sally from the castle and by the troops of Pem- broke, who from without burst open the city gates, the confederates being crowded into the narrow streets were thrown into irre- parable confusion and dismay. Their leader the count of Perche was slain; three earls, eleven barons, and four hundred knights were captured, and received quarter; and thousands of the common soldiery, whose lives the victors had not the same induce- ment to spare, for the sake of ransom or the ties of consanguinity, were mercilessly slaughtered. This total defeat of the army of Louis, which in itself alone must have sufficed eventually to ruin his cause, and which at once reduced him to inaction within the walls of the capital, was shortly followed by a disaster still more immediately fatal to his views of possessing the English crown. A great naval armament which had been prepared in the French ports for his succour, was encountered in the straits between Dover and Calais by the navy of the Cinque ports, under the gallant de Burgh, the heroic defender of Dover castle, and though the English fleet was far in ferior in numbers, the skill and prowess by which the national arms have ever seemed peculiarly adapted to triumph on the ocean,* obtained a complete victory. The entire French fleet, with the exception of fifteen vessels, was taken or destroyed. The situation of Louis in England was now become hopeless and even desperate. Block aded on all sides and already almost a captive in London, instead of longer contending for the throne, he was reduced to capitulate for escape from a prison. He hastened to negotiate a peace with the protector; and obtained from the moderation of that noble man more honourable and easy terms than he had a right to expect, or was in a condi tion to extort. A general and complete amnesty, which Pembroke afterwards in violably observed, was granted to all his English lays adherents; he himself with his French followers was allowed to depart from the realm in safety; and thus pru dently and mildly was a civd war brought to a close, which had threatened to produce the total devastation of the kingdom, to perpetuate the irreconcilable hatred of fac tions, and even to extinguish the national independence and liberties. t. After the expulsion of Louis, the pro tector employed the brief residue of his honourable career in endeavouring, by a firm and equitable administration, to recover the kingdom from the state of lawless dis order, which was the natural consequence of the late struggle. His impartial justice repressed the victorious insolence, and soothed the humiliated pride, of the barons of either faction; and while his energetic enforcement of the laws overawed the tur bulence of both parties, he neglected no means to heal their animosities. His efforts for the restoration of tranquillity were * This victory is expressly attributed by the chronicler to the superior maritime skill and courage of the English : \u2014 \" Nam ab Anglis bellatoribus et in marino pr\u00e6lio eruditus,\" &c.

These salutary measures were shortly followed by the death of the great and good earl marshal (May, 1219); an event which occurred, indeed, too soon for the happiness of his country, but not before he had earned the truly glorious distinction \u2014 rare in all ages, and almost unknown in his own \u2014 of a wise, just, and patriotic statesman. f able and faithful, though not over-scrupu- lous, servant of the crown; the latter an intriguing Poitevin, whose partiality to his countrymen rendered the kingdom a prey to the rapacity of foreigners. The enmity which grew between the justiciary and the king's tutor had the mischievous effect of reanimating that spirit of faction which it had been the great object of Pembroke to suppress ; and the kingdom was thus for several years embroiled anew in obscure party contests, which our defective informa- tion often fails to explain, and of which it would now be a profitless, if it were a prac- ticable, attempt to ascertain the exact motives and merits. Amidst this scene of confusion we may only discern, that the measures of the justiciary De Burgh, in curbing the intemperate spirit and lawless excesses of the feudal aristocracy, were active and vig- orous, and, perhaps necessarily, severe and arbitrary; and that he successfully asserted the royal authority, both against the great barons who strove to limit its prerogative, and against an inferior herd of freebooting chieftains, whose sole aim was to prolong an impunity of rapine by setting all laws at defiance. When the justiciary had thus subdued every open resistance to his admin- istration, he at length obtained a triumph over the covert opposition of his rival, the bishop of Winchester. At his instigation the young king, on attaining his majority, shook off the influence of his preceptor, and dismissed him from his service ; the bishop, to conceal his mortification, quitted the kingdom on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; and thus left without a competitor, Hubert, who had gained an unbounded ascendancy over the royal mind, and now received the earldom of Kent, continued for many years to govern the realm with absolute authority.* Notwithstanding, however, the vigorous character of his administration, De Burgh On his decease, the administration of the realm and the charge of the young king's person J devolved respectively on the justi ciary Hubert de Burgh, and on Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester.

The royal prerogatives had, by the first grant of the Great Charter, been explicitly defined and restricted; and that instrument, twice so lemnlyconfirmed,had become the undoubted law of the land. Its provisions, indeed, were perpetually violated by the royal officers, and its text might almost have become a dead letter, but for an effectual expedient to enforce its observance which was now dis covered in the increasing necessities of the crown. The great revenues which the three first generations of our Norman monarchs had derived from the royal demesnes were dissipated by the prodigality and improvi dence with which both Richard and John had alienated these lands, to gratify either the wants of their own extravagance or the rapacity of licentious followers and unworthy favourites. To such poverty had the crown now been reduced by grants of this kind, that De Burgh was compelled, two years before Henry came of age, to assemble a great couned and to solicit pecuniary aid for enabling the young king to defend the remaining possessions of his house in France, which Louis VIII., who had lately seized upon Rochelle, threatened to wrest alto gether from his hands. The barons and prelates, incensed at continual infringements of their rights, refused to grant any assist ance unless the Great Charter should at the same time be solemnly ratified; and as the wants of the king's government were too urgent to reject almost any terms, a subsidy was given and accepted on this condition. It was agreed that a fifteenth of all movables should be levied throughout the kingdom ; and as the price of this grant, the Great Charter was solemnly ratified, confirmed, and promulgated by the king before the council or parliament of peers, under the same form in which it has ever since maintained its place at the head of the statutes of the realm.* As the young king advanced to the age of manhood, the personal qualities which he developed began to lend their colouring to the character of his reign. Endued by nature neither with vigorous understanding nor constancy of spirit, Henry soon showed himself alike incapable of administering the government, injudicious in the choice of his servants, and unsteady in all his resolves and attachments. Prodigal, faithless, and pusillanimous, his vices at once provoked the indignation and encouraged the resist ance of his subjects: though so averse from all severity, by temperament rather than principle, as to bring contempt on his author ity, so facile as to renounce with equal ease both his enmities and his friendships, the best traits in his disposition partook far more of weakness than virtue. Of such a monarch, and in such times, it is easy to con clude that the reign could be no otherwise than disorderly, unhappy, and inglorious: agitated by the feuds and revolts of a tur bulent nobility; desolated by the violence and ravages of faction ; and disgraced by the abuses and decay of the royal authority, the rapacity of courtly minions, and the triumph of foreign enemies. These were, accord ingly, the principal characteristics in the state of England throughout the long period of forty-six years \u2014 exclusive of a minority often \u2014 during which Henry III. wore the crown ; and so uninviting are our national annals of this half-century, so tedious and confused is the spectacle which they present, and so mean or obscure are the conduct and motives of the principal actors on the troubled scene, that to adopt the conclusion Regni et De Forest a, is given at full length, the following laconic and expressive proof is added of the terms on which these concessions were purchased : \" Rex cepit quintum deci mum pro istis chartis.\" Annales Monast.

At the suggestion of that prelate and others, the king ordered De Burgh to account for the proceeds of all the demesnes and wardships of the crown during the protracted period of his govern ment; and the minister at once perceived by this mandate that he was abandoned to the vengeance of his inveterate enemies. Hopeless of justice, he fled to the sanctuary at Merton, whence Henry \u2014 urged by that hatred in which the weak and ungrateful are ever ready to drown all compunction \u2014 would at first have torn by violence the servant whose fidelity he had so unworthily repaid. Being dissuaded from this purpose, he permitted De Burgh to retire to his home, but was again induced to issue an order for his committal to the Tower. Fleeing a second time to a church, the unfortunate minister was seized at the altar, and borne away a captive;* but the king, fearful of incurring the hostility of the clergy by this violation of ecclesiastical privilege, caused his prisoner to be restored to the sanctuary, and the church to be inclosed by a line of palisades to prevent his escape. Thus en compassed, De Burgh was finally compelled of a writer from whom it is seldom safe to differ, this whole epoch, did it not for the first time exhibit the elements of the Eng lish constitution in a state of disturbed and disorderly fermentation, would scarcely de serve the consideration of the philosopher and the politician.* Though the king had attained his ma jority four years before, f the first real act of authority which he summoned energy to perform was one ungrateful in itself, and ominous for the future quietude of his reign. This was the disgrace of the minister in whose tried fidelity and firmness he had hitherto implicitly confided. At the hand of his sovereign, it cannot be doubted that De Burgh merited a better return for having so long and so ably upheld the royal author ity ; but among the nobility, whose excesses he had curbed with arbitrary severity, he naturally numbered many enemies ; and if it be true that he had amassed great wealth, by obtaining grants to himself of the profits which accrued to the crown from the usual feudal incidents of escheats and wardships, he furnished occasion for charges of personal rapacity, as well as despotic violence in the exercise of his power. The efforts of a hostile faction for his overthrew were pro bably assisted by a growing alienation of the king's mind from his favourite : for it is evident that, like all weak princes under the mastery of a superior spirit, Henry, though incapable of governing for himself, had learned to hate the man to whose vigorous influence he had so long submitted. The first open breach between them occurred * Ou this occasion Paris relates an anecdote, which serves to show that, while Hubert was persecuted by the powerful enemieswhom he had provoked, his real services to his country had won him the respect of the commonalty. His captors having sent for a smith to prepare fetters for his legs, the man inquired for whom they were wanted, and receiving for answer that the captive was Hubert de Burgh, a convicted and fugitive traitor, exclaimed, \" Do unto me as you will, and may God have mercy on my soul ; for as He liveth, I will rather die than forge chains for that man. Is not he the faithful and great Hubert who so often saved England from the rapine of foreigners, and restored her to herself,\" &c. p. 319. It is observable that the monk of St. Albans, who seems to have composed his prolix and valuable chronicle as the events of this reign proceeded, is rather hostile to Hubert during his government, and eulogizes him after his fall \u2014 an echo probably, in this mutable judgment, of the opinions of the day, which calumniated the acts of the great minister in his prosperity, and finished by rendering a tardy justice to his merits. * Mackintosh, Hist, of England, vol i. p. 225. f The eloquent historian last quoted has fallen into an error in stating (p. 228) that \" De Burgh found himself, by growing unpopularity, in 1227 obliged to obtain a declaration in Parliament that the king had attained the years of discre tion,\" _c. In that year Henry did, in fact, complete his majority : and the papal bull which the author proceeds to cite as obtained at the same time, declaring that the young king's manly virtues supplied the defects of his unripe years, bears the date of 1223, when Henry was only seventeen years of age. Hubert was afterwards accused of having pro cured that instrument to oblige the barons to surrender to him the castles which they had held during the royal minority; but in his defence he asserted that it waB done, rather to his loss than advantage, at the suggestion of the great council to the pope, \" quod prudentia et discretio sua (regis) \u0153tatem suam supplevit.\" Matt.

The tale of his subsequent fortunes may be briefly summed up in the facts that, after severe sufferings and great peril, he eventually through the interposition of Edmund, archbishop of Can terbury, was partially restored to his honours and estates, with a seat in the council; and that, surviving his fall ten years, apparently without any attempt to recover his influence in the government, he died peacefully at an advanced age.* some worthier head. The kingdom was on the eve of a general civil war, when such a disaster was averted for a time by the interference of the clergy, whose conduct throughout this reign, as well in mediating between a weak and unprincipled sovereign and a turbulent and exasperated nobility, as in upholding against both the just cause of freedom and law, merits the highest eulo gium. Attended by other prelates, Edmund the new archbishop of Canterbury, a man of prudent and equitable character, waited upon the king, urged the reasonable discon tents of his barons and people, and menaced him with excommunication unless he im mediately discharged his obnoxious foreign servants. Henry was compelled to submit; Peter des Roches and his followers were dismissed, and tranquillity was restored.* If the arbitrary conduct of Hubert de Burgh had supplied the hatred of his per sonal enemies with many just causes of complaint in the infringement of the public liberties, it is certain that the government was much worse administered after his fall. Without any of his redeeming qualities, his rival Peter des Roches, who succeeded him, was imprudent, violent, and rapacious; and so careless of outraging the haughty spirit of the barons, or so blind in his preference of his own countrymen, as to fill all the most lucrative offices of state with Poitevin and Breton adventurers. The insolence of these foreigners, even more than their extortions, provoked the national hatred, supported by which many of the principal barons, retiring from the court and entering into a confederacy against the minister and his adherents, sent a message to the king that, unless he immediately dismissed those men, they would expel both him and them from the realm, and place the crown on The public satisfaction produced by these measures was, however, of brief duration; for within two years the king's marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Raymond, count of Provence, produced a new influx of foreign ers, her countrymen, to whom Henry im mediately attached himself with that facility in bestowing his favour upon strangers which was one of the absurd weaknesses of his character. Three of the queen's maternal uncles of the house of Savoy, William, Peter, and Boniface, who accom panied or followed her to England, were successively promoted to high and lucrative dignities: the first being intrusted with a chief share in the administration of the realm, and finally appointed to the bishopric of Winchester ; the second receiving the honour of Richmond with the wardship of the great earldom of Warenne ; and the third the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury. Not contented with their own good fortune, the brothers obtained rich provision in Eng land for crowds of their rapacious followers ; and many Provencal damsels of rank were also invited into the kingdom, and married to such young noblemen as were in ward ship to the crown.

Even in a venerable old age, however, Hubert did not escape some further persecution from his worthless master (Paris, pp. 462, 463), for seven years after his removal from office, he was once more called upon to answer to a series of charges, in which all the alleged delin quencies of his long administration were raked up against him. In the Liber Additamentorum of the Monk of St. Albans (pp. 1077-1081) the curious inquirer will find a detached and interesting record of these charges, with the replies of his Counsel ; and his vindication appears to have been as able and triumphant as the persecution was ungrateful and iniquitous.

Four of these young noblemen, Henry's half-brothers, Guy, William, Geoffroi, and Aymer de Valence, all arrived in England, and, together with adventurers in their train, were so loaded by the king with honours and wealth, that the name of a Gascon became as odious to the English as that of a Poitevin, a Provencal, and a Savoyard had already been rendered.* The audacious contempt with which all these foreign favourites outraged the laws and feelings of the people on whom they preyed was, as usual in such cases, even more intolerable to the natives than their cupidity; and instead of wondering that the long course of prodigal imbecility and misrule, during which Henry abandoned himself to the influence of these insolent and rapacious aliens, ended in the subversion of his author ity, it may rather excite our surprise that his indignant subjects should so long have endured the abuses of a government and the unprincipled follies of a prince at once so exasperating and so feeble. tories which his father had lost in France, he suffered a new portion of them to be torn from his crown, and in general reaped nothing but defeat and dishonour from the feeble and abortive enterprises in which he engaged in that country. On the death of Philippe Auguste and the accession of his son, Louis VIII., some years before Henry had attained his majority, the English re- gency demanded the fulfilment of a secret promise upon oath, by which Louis is said to have purchased his safe retreat from Lon- don:* that, on succeeding to his father's crown, he would restore the fiefs of Nor- mandy, Anjou, and Maine, which Philippe had wrested from the house of Plantagenet. But, even if he had ever made this condi- tion, Louis was so far from now intendino- o its fulfilment, that, as already mentioned, he burst into Poitou, captured Rochelle and other towns, and overran the whole pro- vince. The more extensive and valuable territory of Gascony was with difficulty pre- served from his grasp ; but within three years his death, the minority of his son Louis IX., and the disputed regency of his widow, Blanche of Castile, presented to Henry the fairest occasion of reconquering the rights of his family. Yet, though in- vited over by the duke or count of Brittany, and by many barons of Normandy and Poitou, Henry, whether by the fault of his minister De Burgh, or the disturbed state of his own kingdom, lost the precious season of action; and no invasion of France was attempted until Blanche, a woman of mas culine courage and talent, had found time to establish her authority and to provide for the security of her government. When Meanwhile the king was engaged in a series of transactions with foreign powers in which, if he had displayed either courage or ability, he might have blinded the nation to the faults of his domestic government. But abroad his conduct was as improvident and disgraceful, as at home it was reckless and grievous. Though in the course of his reign more than one favourable opportunity was afforded to him of recovering the terri- * The treaty by which Louis obtained his free retreat from England (Rymer, vol. i. pp. 221, 222) certainly contains no such provision ; and Matthew Paris is inaccurate in stating (p. 251), as among the articles of the peace, that the French prince swore \" Et quod pro posse suo patrem suum Philippum induceret, ut Henrico Anglorum regi redderet omnia jura sua in partibus transmarinis, et cum rex foret, ipse in pace dimitteret.\" But that Louis privately took such an oath to purchase his safety may be true; and the monk of West minster states \" Juravit Ludovicus .... et si quandoque ad regnum Franci\u00e6 tenendum perveniret, ipse eadem (id est jura Regis Henrici) sine difficultate resignaret.\" West. p. 278.

He disgusted his partisans, allowed his army to melt away without attempting a single operation of moment against the enemy, and after an inglorious campaign, or rather a round of contemptible pleasures, returned to England loaded with disgrace and debt. * and lying without troops in the immediate neighbourhood of a considerable armed force which his disobedient vassal had assembled, he heartily wished himself back again at Paris \u2014 a wish which, as Joinville adds, he could not realize till after fifteen days' anxious suspense, and some compromise with the count de la Marche, of the precise nature of which the chronicler is unable to inform us.* After this scandalous failure, which in the opinion of a chivalrous age had branded him with the character of a recreant prince, who had degenerated from the spirit, and wanted courage to fight for the inheritance, of his house, he suffered twelve years to elapse without an effort to retrieve his dis- honour. At length, on a quarrel of his step-father, the Count de la Marche, with the brother of the French king, on whom the fief of Poitou had been bestowed, Henry was persuaded to renew the contest. But the throne of France was now efficiently filled by Louis IX., who, though yet in early manhood, already united in his person all the virtues of a saint with the gallant spirit of a knight and the talents of a states- man. To such a monarch the feeble king of England was no competent opponent ; and notwithstanding the efforts of the for- midable confederacy at the head of which he was placed, the event of the contest was determined by the character of the leaders. The quarrel arose out of the investiture of Alfonso, the French king's brother and son- in-law of Raymond VII., with the fief of Poitou. Hugues, count de la Marche, who had taken to wife Isabella, queen-dowager of England (the lady who many years before had been wrested from him by the late King John), asserted the claim of his step-son Richard, earl of Cornwall,! upon the con quered province, and refused his homage to Alfonso. The king was abandoned at Poitiers by most of the barons whom he had summoned to witness the ceremony, Hugues was well aware of the uncertain tenure of a reconciliation thus effected by necessity, and he lost no time, there fore, in strengthening himself by alliances. Raymond of Toulouse, smarting under the deprivation of the chief portion of his dominions, and jealous of the aggrandize ment of his daughter in her husband's new fief of Poitou at his own expense, was easily allured to join in a projected league against France ; and he received the hand of a daughter of Hugues and Isabella (thus a half-sister of Henry III.), in the hope of issue, by which he might disinherit Alfonso and Jeanne. The kings of England, of Arragon, of Castile, and of Navarre, and Trencavel, viscount of Bezun and Carcas sone (son of that gallant Raymond Roger who had perished thirty years before in the dungeons of Simon de Montfort), entered into a confederacy with the count de la Marche; and it was agreed that he should withhold an open declaration of resistance till Alfonso held his first court at Poitiers. On that occasion Hugues publicly renounced aUegiance to the French prince, whom he stigmatized as a usurper; and accompanied his defiance by an act of fierce insult, setting fire to the house in which he had been lodged, and then galloping furiously from the city.f War was now inevitable. Henry III., in spite of the disinclination loudly expressed by his Parliament, t. embarked with his brother, the earl of Cornwall; and before * \" Saint Louis auroit bien voulu etre arriere _ Paris, mais onques il n'osa partir tant qu'il fut accorde au Comto de la Marche.\" * Matt.

During the following month Louis actively employed himself in reducing the chief towns of Poitou. Before one of them, Fontenay, Alfonso was severely wounded; and on its surrender the king consented to raze it to the ground as some expiation for his brother's sufferings. The courtiers would have pushed his vengeance to far more odious severity; and they urged him to put to an ignominious death a natural son of the Count de la Marche, who com manded the garrison, and more than one hundred captive knights and soldiers, who served under him. The king's reply was noble, and in full accordance with many other testimonies of his generous spirit which history has recorded: \u2014 \"The one,\" he said, \" has not committed any crime in obeying his father, nor the others in ful filling the orders of their general.\" f as we are able to collect from the indistinct narrative of the chroniclers, the French, partly in boats and partly traversing a narrow bridge which ought to have been better defended, lodged a detachment on the opposite bank of the river ; and the Eng- lish, struck with panic, fled precipitately to Saintes. So hot was the pursuit that many French entered the gates together with the fugitives, and were made prisoners in spite of their success.* Two days afterwards, a severe battle was fought under the walls of Saintes, which terminated somewhat to the advantage of the French. Discouraged by these reverses, little confident in either the ability or the constancy of Henry, and manifestly deceived by his other allies, the Count de la Marche opened secret negotia- tions with Louis ; and the king of England, after a few days' abode in Saintes, which he had resolved to maintain against a siege, learned at the same moment that its terrified inhabitants were preparing to open their gates to the enemy, and that Hugues, by whose invitation he had commenced the war, was treating for a separate peace. His alarm on the receipt of this intelligence assuredly was not without cause, and its effects are most graphically described by Matthew Paris. Messenger after messenger poured in, breathless and panting, to an nounce some new addition of peril; and it plainly appeared that nothing but instant and most rapid flight could save the whole army from destruction. Dinner was about to be served, when the king's terror was raised to its height by fresh and more authentic confirmation of the treachery of his allies ; and hastily rising from table, hungry and empty as he was, he spared neither his horse's flanks nor his own spurs, little regarding who of his people had the The king of England concentrated his forces at Taillebourg in order to dispute the passage of the Charente ; but he was greatly outnumbered by the French, since, with the exception of the Count de la Marche, not one of his allies had put their promised contingent in motion. Alarmed at this inferiority, he despatched the earl of Corn wall to attempt negotiation ; and that prince, who had just returned from the Holy Land, divesting himself of his armour, and bearing a pilgrim's staff, approached the French camp. Richard had served with great dis tinction in Palestine, where he had de servedly won the gratitude of many French knights, who were indebted to him for freedom. His reception, therefore, by his ancient comrades in arms was most kind and affectionate ; and in the king's tent he was hailed, not as a messenger from the enemy, but as a kinsman and as a soldier of the Cross, t.

For two days and nearly two nights before he reached Blaye on the Garonne he neither ate nor slept; and the sufferings of his army in its tumul tuary retreat before it rejoined him were most acute. No provision had been made for this unexpected movement, and the only scanty sustenance which his famishing sol diers could procure during their march was derived from the wild berries which they plucked by the roadside. The loss of men and horses was consequently great, so great, says the chronicler, as to move abundant tears from all who beheld it. * acquired, the Count de la Marche gave him an acquittance for ten thousand livres Parisis which he was wont to receive from him annually.\"* Louis, however, was far from pushing him to extremity; and a noble anecdote of his generosity to another adhe rent of the English crown deserves record as most honourable both to himself and to its object. Amid the general defection from Henry which followed his retreat, a single vassal, Hertolde, sieurde Mirambeau, strictly mindful of his allegiance, offered to main tain his castle, on the frontiers of La Sain tonge and Bourdelois, against the approaches of the French, provided by so doing he could assist the English and they could pro mise him ultimate relief. To make known this intention he traversed the country to Bordeaux ; and in a personal inter view with Henry learned from him his utter inability to afford assistance, and re ceived permission to adopt whatever course might best insure his safety. Hertolde, on this declaration, promptly repaired to Louis and tendered submission. The king replied that he was well informed of all that had passed with Henry, that vassals thus faithful deserved recompense, and that Hertolde's castle and fiefs should still remain his own without further guarantee than his oath of allegiances Louis, content with the entire discom fiture of his enemy, exercised great mode ration, and forbore pursuit. Yet the king of England renewed his ignominious flight, not thinking himself secure till he had gained the coast at Bordeaux.! On enter ing Saintes, Louis received the submission of the Count de la Marche, who did homage to Alfonso as count of Poitiers. The count, says Joinville, \" knowing that he could not amend himself for the evil that he had done, surrendered himself, his wife, and children, prisoners to the king, who, on consenting to a peace, gained many con siderable territories from the count. J I have heard that, with the lands the king * The first messenger of evil tidings is described as \" fes- tinus et anhelus;\" then, \"jam prandia paraverunt omnes Anglorum \u00e6ditui, pr\u00e6ambuli, procurators ct marescalli ; et incontinenti cum rex pransurus suit, festinanter audito secundo nuncio,\" &c. The loss of dinner evidently haunts the good monk's imagination as the heaviest calamity of all which Herlry and his soldiers endured, and is the subject of repeated allusions : \" Non parcens equinis lateribus vel acutis calcaribus, iter versus Blavium festinanter fugitivus continuavit, non multum curans quis etiam suorum sequeretur, jejunus penitiis et inanis.\" The nobles followed as they could, \"semicoctis cibariis relictis, subito impransi, arreptis equis velocioribus.\" Last of all came the main body impi-ansus also, and \" pr\u00e6 debilitate deficiens. Et nisi prinorum et prunorum sylves- trium obiter refocillarentur exili interim edulio, anim\u00e6 in ipsis defecissent.\" The distance from Saintes to Blaye does not exceed forty miles, and since Henry rode at full speed, he probably missed his way or found it necessary to make a circuit; for without some such supposition his allowance of time is most extravagant ; \" Non enim comederat vel dor- mierat jam per dies duos et etiam duas fere noctes.\" Matt. Paris, pp. 592, 593. f In this second race, Henry lost \" Capellam suam, id est omnia sacerdotalia preciosissima, et multa alia qn\u00e6 longum est enarrare, pr\u00e6ter reliquias.\" Id. ibid.

According to bis account, Hertolde waited upon the king of England, \" post laments, lacrymas aduberes, et ab alto corde tracta suspiria;\" on his arrival he addressed Henry, \"genas perfusus rore lachrymarum, exitus aquarum deducebant oculi ejus, singultibusque sermones suos interrumpentibus;\" and he afterwards proceeded to Louis, \"flens et ejulans, crinibus hirsutis et oculis pr\u00e6 fletu rubicundis,\" pp. 593, 594. All this weeping is much out of character with the firmness, frankness, and fidelity of the chief actor.

[a.d. 1248. 212 quate supplies which had been provided for the maintenance of the army (an almost invariable failure in the wrars of that period), had generated fever and dysentery, which made frightful ravages. The king himself suffered under the disease, and unable to pursue active operations, he signed a truce with England, to continue for five years.* Notwithstanding this denial and bold remonstrance, which has appeared worth transcription in this place as embodying the general substance of the national grievances throughout a profligate reign, the king continued his extortions by forced loans and other arbitrary means; and within two years he made a new demand upon the Parliament, who were now reluctantly in duced to grant him a supply, upon his agreement that four barons should be ap pointed to his council, both as conservators of the public liberties and to regulate the expenditure of the money to be raised. * After Henry's disgraceful expedition to Guienne, his misgovernment was still borne by his outraged subjects, though with in creasing and ominous impatience, for above ten years more, before they attempted any violent remedy. Throughout this period his expenditure was equally prodigal and senseless. To supply his necessities, his demands, even in the shape of regular taxa tion, were grievous and importunate ; his illegal expedients for filling his exhausted exchequer were still more exorbitant and intolerable; and his open violations of the Great Charter were incessant and shameless. Before his embarkation for France on the late enterprise he had been compelled to solicit a subsidy from the great couned of prelates and barons, or Parliament, as it now began to be called; and had received from that assembly a positive written refusal, in which he was reminded that, since his accession, they had already granted him a thirteenth, a fifteenth, a sixteenth, and a fortieth of all personal property in the realm, besides two hydages on all lands, and several scutages from his feudal tenants ; that, moreover, he had within the last four years obtained a thirtieth on personals, upon a condition which he had broken, that this supply should be deposited in the charge of four barons of their appointment, who were to exercise a control over its expenditure; and, above all, that since the perversion of that grant he had received large sums from feudal incidents, and had extorted much more by violations of the Charter.f But these conditions, like all former pro mises, the king scrupled not to break as soon as the aid had been voted; and when, four years afterwards, he had again recourse to Parliament for assistance, it is not sur prising that, instead of granting him any, his barons openly reproached him with his bad faith, asking him if he did not blush, after his repeated breaches of promise and violations of the Great Charter, to make such a request from subjects whose money he squandered upon foreigners. After an other interval of five years, during which he supplied his wants with various illegal exactions, Henry found a more successful expedient for obtaining money from his Parliament by pretending to take the Cross. On this plea his prelates and nobles could not decently refuse him a grant ; but still making his future observance of the Great Charter a condition of their assent, they laboured to discover some new and more effectual plan for binding his conscience. Promises he had utterly disregarded, ordi nary oaths he had unscrupulously broken; but if he would voluntarily join in pledging the eternal safety of his soul on his main tenance of the Charter, it was believed that he would not incur the tremendous guilt and punishment of a new perjury. In the great hall of Westminster, before the assem bled Parliament, the members of which meanwhile held lighted tapers in their hands, the prelates pronounced a solemn * Henry III. abandoned tbe Isle of Rhe- and some for tresses which he had taken in the late campaign, and agreed to pay \u00a35000 sterling annually to France.

When that pontiff, for the gratification of his hatred against the house of Hohenstauffen, looked around for an instrument to eject the race of Frederick II. from the Sicilian part of their inheritance, he found a ready dupe for the furtherance of his vengeance and cupidity in the English king; and Henry accepted with avidity a proposal for placing his second son, Prince Edmund, on the throne of the Sicilies. But force was necessary to expel the family of Frederick from that seat; Henry had no money to equip and to put in action an adequate armament; and nothing was further from the intention of Innocent than to waste his own treasure on the enter prise. Though, therefore, he was willing to advance the necessary funds by way of loan, he audaciously exacted a condition that the kingdom of England should be pledged for the repayment of whatever sums might be expended in a war which was foreign to the national interests, and designed chiefly for the advantage of the Holy See.* Henry, without consulting his subjects, had the gross weakness not only to subscribe to these terms, but to expect their acquittance by his refractory Parlia ment. The attempt to place his son on the Sicilian throne proved wholly abortive ; and when we learn, by the declaration of the imbeede king, that the sums which Innocent and his successor Alexander IV. professed to have disbursed in the scheme, and for which the pope held the realm of England chargeable with interest, under pain of It must be confessed, however, that the necessities of Henry were not entirely of his own creation: for the alienation of the royal demesnes before his accession, and the restrictions imposed on the feudal preroga tives of the crown by the Great Charter had, as already remarked, placed him in a very different position from his ancestors, who, deriving a great revenue from sources of which he was deprived, had easily avoided all pecuniary dependence on their subjects. But the prodigality with which he dissi pated his treasures among foreign favourites * Paris, however, is careful to note that, when a taper was handed to the king among the re6t, he refused to hold it, saying he was not a priest ; and the good monk thence evi dently suspects him of perjury prepense \u2014 the studied omission of this important point of the ceremony on his part doubtless lessening his share in the peril, p. 746. \" Et respondit rex cum omnibus astantibus, Amen, Amen,\" is Matthew of West minster's account, p. 353. * In Rymer, vol. i. p. 515, are two curions letters from the pope, one to Henry, exhorting him to practise economy that he might increase his resources for the Sicilian enterprise, and the other to his queen, desiring her to use her influence over her husband for the same object. In both, the royal pair are told to contract their expenses even in pious uses, since this was itself an enterprise above all works of piety \u2014 \"cum ipsius prosecutio negotii superet omnia opera pietatis ! \" t Matt.

By the collusion, or at least in general without the opposition, of Henry and his ministers, they extorted immense sums from the wealthy chapters and monasteries of England; and they re- warded their Italian retainers with the best benefices of the English church : but if they thus ministered to their own present wants, they fatally injured the future interests of the papacy. Their rapacity offended the national clergy in the tenderest points; and in heavily taxing the temporalties, they alienated the spiritual affections of an order by whose faithful allegiance mainly their predecessors had been enabled to triumph both over Henry II. and John, and to reduce the latter prince and his son into a condition of vassalage to Rome. The dis- solution which was thus provoked of the ancient and natural union between the popedom and the English church, produced some important effects both upon the civil and ecclesiastical affairs of the kingdom: it gave the clergy a common interest with the nobles and people in restraining the abuse of the royal authority ; and the disgust which they had conceived to the exactions of Rome, by favouring rather than opposing the high-spirited resistance of Henry's suc- cessors to her pretensions, contributed very essentially to rescue the monarchy and the nation from the subjection into which both had fallen to the papal yoke.* excommunication, reached the enormous sum of one hundred and forty thousand marks, we need not wonder that the an nouncement was received by the Parliament with equal consternation and disgust.* In the indignation to which that assembly was excited by the egregious and unprin- cipled folly of their sovereign and the shameless chicanery of the pope, the whole body of the clergy throughout the realm had abundant reason to share ; and to supply the means of repayment which the barons . refused, the ecclesiastical order found them- selves abandoned to every species of extor- tion. Throughout this reign, indeed, we are presented with the singular spectacle of a connivance of the crown with the papacy to plunder the clergy; and of a consequent alliance between the latter body and the aristocracy, to assert the national liberties against this double oppression. All the circumstances of Henry's position and character had placed him in implicit sub jection to the see of Rome. In infancy he had been in a great measure indebted to its protection for the support of his cause against a foreign rival and a hostile faction of his own subjects; and during his minority the continual presence of a papal legate had been deemed necessary for the security of his throne. Thus taught from his earliest years to consider himself the ward and vassal of the Holy See, he had become habituated to the sense of dependence on that power; and in every difficulty of his subsequent life, his feeble and pusillanimous spirit led him to appeal to its authority against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It would have been contrary to the invari- able spirit of its policy, if the papal court had failed to profit by so abject a reliance on its aid and submission to its will. But the pecuniary necessities of the successive popes who had embarked in a dangerous contest with the empire under Frederick II., reduced them to make an immediate rather than a far-sighted use of the advan- * It would be endless to cite the passages in chronicles of the period, which prove the indignation produced in the Eng lish clergy during the reign before us, by the exactions of the papacy. The hostility of Matthew Paris to its power is per petually apparent, and must be familiar to every reader of his voluminous history. But if the display of this spirit \u2014 which has made the monk of St. Albans a favourite with Protestant writers, and excited a splenetic desire in those of the Romish persuasion to detract from the authority of his work \u2014 may be thought to render him a prejudiced witness, the same sus picion cannot be extended to the Monastic Annals of Burton, which are filled with the complaints of the clergy against the extortions of Rome and the appointment of Italians to Eng lish benefices. In those annals (ad ann. 1244) is preserved a formal remonstrance from the English church against an oppressive pecuniary demand from Innocent IV., of which two passages may sufficiently show the temper : \u2014 \" Item, cum dicat veritas, Tu es Petrus, &c, reservavit sibi proprietatem, committendo curam, sicut patet ex verbis Evangelii sequentibus, Quodcunque ligaveris super terram, et quodcunque solveris, &c, non quodcumque rapueris vel exegeris super terram, erit raptum vel exactum in c\u00e6lis.\" * Matt.

This was Simon de Montfort, the younger of the two sons of that fanatical, aspiring, and sanguinary chieftain who had earned such an infamous celebrity in the war against the Albigenses. Though of foreign extraction, the house of Montfort had succeeded by marriage to the earldom of Leicester ; and on his elder brother Amaury obtaining the dignity of constable of France, and resigning his Eng lish fief in his favour, Simon had received its investiture from Henry. After his arrival in England, the new earl of Leicester had also won the affections and obtained the hand of the king's sister, the widowed countess of Pembroke; and this royal alliance, perhaps, first raised his ambitious thoughts to the throne itself. It is at least discernible that from this period he sedulously laboured both to acquire an influence over the discontented barons, and to cultivate the affections of the clergy and people; and it is a strong evi dence of his political ability that, notwith standing the prejudice which his foreign lineage had at first excited against him, he became the most popular nobleman in the realm.* The king, who had begun with his usual weakness by showing the earl a favour of which he had afterwards sufficient reason to repent, intrusted him with the government of Guienne ; and in the defence of that province De Montfort had highly distinguished his courage and activity. But Henry, endeavouring on some com plaints from his Gascon subjects to find a plea for depriving him of that command in savour of his son Edward, rashly provoked the resentment of the powerful earl ; and so open a rupture ensued between them, that the king in a scandalous altercation in temperately called him a traitor ; and De Montfort answered that he lied, and that if it were not that his royal dignity protected him, he should have had cause to repent of the insult .f This indecent scene was followed by a hollow reconciliation : but De Montfort thenceforth openly arrayed himself at the head of the baronage against the court; and his imprudent and imbecile sovereign soon began to reap the fruits of his folly in having alternately fostered and outraged so formidable a subject, whose grateful attach ment he had failed to secure, and whose insolence he wanted the energy or power to chastise. At this juncture it was also peculiarly unfortunate for Henry that he was deprived of the only counterpoise to the dangerous weight of De Montfort, by the absence of his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall. That prince, whose character was in every respect the opposite of Henry's, had, by his manly and prudent qualities, \" Item, licet esset bonum contribnere, omitti debet propter scandalum suscitatum contra ecclesiam Romanam, quia dicitur quod publice alias fact\u00e6 fuerunt hujusmodi exactiones et extorsiones et clerici depauperati, et statim, exacta pecunia, colluserunt papa et imperator; et similiter modo timetur.'' p. 298. Two years afterwards, in a similar remonstrance, they tell Innocent plainly, that his proceedings threaten great scandal and schism in the church, and that if he continues to intrude Italians into English benefices, the nobles of the land will reclaim the property of endowments thus diverted from the purposes intended by their founders ; and the barons in Par liament declare to the pope still more boldly, that if these grievances are not redressed, they will employ force, pp. 306-310. * It is remarkable that, in 1237, Leicester is numbered by Matthew Paris among the foreign favourites most obnoxious to the English barons, p. 376. And in becoming a party to the earl's marriage with his sister, which by Paris' account seems to have been performed clandestinely, or at least without the previous consent of his great council, Henry so grievously offended his barons that to conciliate them he was compelled to sanction some attempts to annul the union ; which Leicester, however, defeated by a journey to Rome and profuse bribery at the papal court. Paris, pp. 393, 396, 398. The whole story of this intrigue is curious, from the contrast which it affords between Leicester's position at this period and his subsequent conduct. Finally, the monastic annalist himself gives vent to the following sarcastic opinion of the merits of the intimacy between the pope and the king : \u2014 \" Cum inter dominum Innocentium summum pontificem, et dominum Henricum regem Angli\u00e6, esset amor reciprocus, prout populus pr\u00e6di cabat, magis ob amorem pecuni\u00e6 de Anglornm marsupiis utriusque videlicet populi exhauriend\u00e6 sive extorquend\u00e6, qnam propter patri\u00e6 c\u00e6lestis regnnm et gloriam adqui- t Matt.

[a.d. 1258. 216 De Montfort and his principal associates, the earls of Gloucester and Hereford; and the violence of their counsels was promptly shown in their actions. At a Parliament which Henry had summoned to meet him in Westminster, for the purpose of obtaining supplies to secure for his son the crown of Sicily, those three earls surprised him by appearing at the head of the barons in complete armour. The dismay of the king was shown in the inquiry, whether he was to consider himself their prisoner; and he received little comfort from their dis- claimer of any hostile purpose, when they proceeded to insist upon the dismissal of his evil foreign counsellors, and the appoint- ment of a commission of prelates and barons to redress the abuses and exercise the func- tions of government. Finding resistance hopeless, he was compelled to purchase a brief respite from his embarrassment by naming a day for the assembling of a Par- liament at Oxford, in which twenty-four commissioners should be chosen, one half by himself and the other by the barons, to reform the abuses of the government and to redress the grievances of the people. At the appointed time and place a great council was accordingly held, which, from the intemperance of its measures, has be come stigmatized in our annals as the Mad Parliament. Its provisions were, in fact, completely revolutionary. Whether it was that the king's adherents were overawed at the formidable array of their opponents, who came attended by their armed retainers, or that Henry, like his father at Runnymede, had enemies in his own train, the whole administration of government was suffered to fall into the hands of the popular party. Leicester was placed at the head of this supreme council, which speedily engrossed both the legisla tive and executive power of the kingdom. They ordered four knights to be chosen by each county, who should make inquiry into the state of their respective districts, and should attend the ensuing Parliament to give information respecting the complaints long enjoyed the esteem of the nation. While the king had brought only disgrace on the English arms, Richard had sought to emulate the chivalric deeds of his great uncle and namesake of the Lion Heart, and had won immortal honour on the fields of Palestine : while Henry was basely squander ing the resources of his crown, the earl, by many years of wise economy in the manage ment of his private revenues, had become the richest prince in Europe. His wealth, however, was now destined to produce only unhappiness to himself and to his house; for the report of his opulence, joined to the fame of his achievements, induced some of the German princes during the great Inter regnum, to make him a tender of the imperial crown; and Richard belied his reputation for wisdom, by suffering his vanity to be dazzled into the acceptance of a splendid but empty dignity. Though crowned he never established more than a nominal empire, even by the most lavish expenditure. The circumstances of his disputed election to the initiatory title of king of the Romans belong to the history of the German empire, and need not be related here; but his departure from his own country was fatal to its peace. Though dissimilarity of temper had placed him usually in opposition to the misconduct and extravagance of his brother, and had induced him to take a conspicuous share in resisting the abuses of the royal prerogative, he manifested no inclination to subvert the lawful authority of the crown ; and his temperate character disposed him, in the quarrel between an unprincipled govern ment and an exasperated nobility, rather to act as a mediator for the redress of just grievances, than to espouse the cause of either of the extreme parties by which he was mutually respected and feared.* As soon as Richard had sailed for Ger many, the English nobility abandoned themselves to the uncontrolled guidance of * Wikes, p. 52 : who expressly attributes the revolt of the barons to their being relieved from the fear of the earl of Cornwall by his departure from the kingdom."], [255, "a.d. 1258-1259.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 217 of their constituents. They decided that three sessions of Parliament should be held regularly every year; that a new sheriff should be elected annually by the free holders; that no wards or castles should be intrusted to foreigners ; that no new warrens or forests should be made, nor the revenues of any counties farmed out. When the twenty-four commissioners proceeded to select four of their number, who again nominated an executive state council of fifteen members, it was found that, although half the original electors had been chosen by the king, none of his nearest connections and friends had been admitted to a share of the supreme power. The preponderance of the earl of Leicester and his immediate party was soon rendered still more evident, when all the ministerial dignities of the realm and the command of most of the royal castles were taken from their former holders, and bestowed upon the leaders and partisans of the same faction. The royal authority itself was now prostrate. On some show of distrust or resistance to the predominant party, Henry's four half-brothers were sur rounded in a fortress to which they had retired, and reduced to banish themselves from the kingdom; the two young princes, Edward and Henry, the king's eldest son and nephew, were compelled to take an oath of submission to the ordinances of the new council of state ; and even Richard of Corn wall, now on his return from Germany to replenish his already exhausted coffers from his English domains, was not suffered to land until he had consented to swear to the same effect.* bold leader of the triumphant faction, his overthrow and death in the field, and the final re-establishment of legitimate govern ment. Throughout this period of agitation and anarchy the succession of events is so rapid and confused, their transitional causes so obscure, and then real character often so difficult to ascertain in the contradictory records of the time, that even the most elaborate efforts of modern inquiry have been able only to present a perplexed and unsatisfactory narration of conflicting details ; and within our limits it would be vain to attempt more than a general notice of their leading features and results. Repeated experience of the king's bad faith had per suaded his subjects that the vices of his government were incurable by any measures within the ordinary bounds of the laws : but whatever justification \u2014 and doubtless it was a strong one \u2014 might be set up for tbe con duct of the baronial party at the outset, in wresting the administration of the kingdom from the hands of a worthless prince and his rapacious favourites, who had violated the most solemn pledges and trampled upon the recognized liberties of the nation, it is evident that the pretended reformers had no sooner possessed themselves of the supreme power, than they flagrantly abused the trust to establish and perpetuate an ambitious usur pation. Instead of redressing the public grievances, as they had undertaken, by the end of the year, the council of state had engrossed all the principal posts of govern ment and the feudal profits of the crown for themselves and their followers for eighteen months, before they even affected to com mence their labours; and the measures for purifying the administration of justice which public clamour at length admonished them to institute, were so deceptive and inade quate as to excite general indignation as well as disappointment. The nation discovered that the abuses of the royal government had only been superseded by the yet more hateful, because still less legitimate, oppression of an oligarchy; the baronial faction itself was weakened by dissensions The seven years which followed the en actment of the Provisions of Oxford were an epoch of revolution: in which we are presented with the quick vicissitudes of an oligarchical usurpation; of the momentary restoration of the regal authority ; and of a civil war producing the defeat and captivity of the monarch, the single tyranny of the * Matt.

He annulled the Provisions of Oxford as entirely subversive of all monarchical authority, and ordered the barons to restore to their king all the royal castles and just prerogatives of the crown. But he also prescribed the observance on Henry's part, towards his subjects, of all the immunities and liberties established by the Great Charter. And he further enjoined on both parties a mutual amnesty and oblivion of past injuries.* among its leaders; the pope absolved the king and all his subjects from the oath which they had taken to observe the Provisions of Oxford, and in 1262 Henry found himself strong enough to dissolve the usurping council, and issued a proclamation declaring that he had resumed the government. The baronial party assembled their forces and threatened a civfl war; but hostilities were averted for a time by negotiations, and De Montfort, dispirited by the temporary weakness of his faction, having withdrawn to France, an apparent reconciliation was effected between his adherents and the king, which left Henry in possession of his regal authority.* Although Leicester and his associates had solemnly sworn f to obey the decision of Louis, they immediately rejected this award ; and the whole kingdom became a prey to the horrors of civil war. In the midland parts the strength of the hostile factions was nearly equal; in the extreme west and north the royalists had the preponderance: but in the capital and surrounding counties, of which the disposition was most likely to determine the issue of the struggle, the influence of Leicester was unbounded. That nobleman, relieved by the recent death of his former coadjutor, the earl of Gloucester, of the only powerful rival whose jealousy or moderation had checked his ambition, now openly aspired to an uncontrolled authority over his party ; and while aU the qualities of a master spirit in the council and the field enabled him to acquire an absolute ascendancy over the minds of his fellow nobles, his affected zeal for popular rights, and above all, the reputed sanctity of a character fanatical by inheritance and temper, secured him the devoted attachment and The triumph of that monarch, however, was of short duration, and was probably rendered abortive by his usual imprudence and incapacity. While he rashly deserted his post to pay an idle visit of ceremony to Louis IX. in France, Leicester arrived in England, reorganized his party, and ap peared in arms at their head. On return ing to his kingdom Henry soon found himself almost a prisoner in the capital. At the approach of the baronial army the populace, who were devoted to Leicester, threw open their gates to receive him, and grossly insulted the queen in her attempt to escape by water from the Tower. Again was Henry compelled to bend before the revolutionary storm, and again was a com promise effected, in which the king of the Romans appeared as a mediator. But the royal party having thus gained time to rally, angry and inconclusive discussions were renewed in Parliament, and hostilities in the field; until both parties, finding their strength nearly balanced, agreed to refer their disputes to the king of France, and to abide by his judgment. That excellent prince, before whom Henry appeared in person at Amiens and the insurgent leaders veneration of the inferior clergy and people.

An example of good faith, with which that young prince, though he had reluctantly sworn to observe the Provisions of Oxford, afterwards refused to become a party to their violation, had won the respect of the nation; and now that civil war was inevitable, his activity and gallantry in the field were the firmest support of the throne. Leicester even into the town of Lewes, was there compelled to surrender himself to the victor. When Prince Edward, there fore, returned too late from his vengeful pursuit of the Londoners, it was only to discover the fatal fruits of his rashness, to behold the abandoned field covered with the bodies of the slain and dying royalists, and to learn that his father and uncle with the northern lords were captives to the enemy. The remaining events of a day so disastrous to the royal cause are variously related : but it ended in the desertion of the young prince by his now panic-stricken followers; and it produced, on the following morning, his generous surrender with that of his cousin Henry as hostages, to obtain the promised liberation of their fathers, or even to save the lives of the royal and noble captives, whom Leicester threatened to put to death. By the capitulation which Edward thus concluded with that nobleman, and which received the name of the \" Mise of Lewes \" \u2014 an obsolete French term signifying an agreement* \u2014 it was further provided that all other prisoners on both sides should be released; that a Parliament should be assembled for the settlement of the realm ; and that all differences which could not therein be adjusted, should finally be decided by arbitration. f After some desultory hostilities the armies of the contending factions, who were equally anxious for battle, drew out in front of the town and castle of Lewes, in Sussex, to decide their quarrel (May 14, 1264). In the royal host were present Henry himself in person and the king of the Romans, with their respective sons Edward and Henry ; their uterine brother, the Earl Warenne ; the principal lords of the northern border, Percy, Bruce, Balliol, and Comyn, and other nobles, and their retainers : the con- federated insurgents were led by Leicester himself, seconded by two of his sons, Henry and Guy de Montfort, by the great earls of Gloucester and Hereford, and by a long array of the English baronage with their immediate vassals, and a body of fifteen thousand Londoners. The battle commenced by an eager onset of this civic militia, who were received with a furious charge by Prince Edward, broken, and put to flight. At this crisis, had the royal cavalry wheeled round upon the rear of the baronial bands, they might have completed their victory. But the young prince, flushed with success, and burning to revenge on the Londoners their late insults to his mother, pursued them for four miles with relentless slaughter; and Leicester, a cool and patient witness of his rash passion, only waited until it had carried him off the field, before he himself fell, at the head of the baronial chivalry, with overwhelming force on the weakened array of the two monarchs, and inflicted on that division of the royalists a total and bloody defeat. The valiant king of the Romans was taken prisoner on the first charge; and Henry, being driven off the field and pursued by But Leicester, having now the whole royal family in his power, was become, in fact, the sole and absolute ruler of the state; and he was resolved, by the most audacious violation of good faith, to per petuate the power which he had usurped. While, therefore, he affected to release Henry, and treated him with the empty semblance of respect, it was only the better to avail himself of the royal authority: for he took care to keep the feeble king in secure constraint, and employed his seal for every purpose of state, without deigning even to consult him in its use. But instead of liberating the king of the Romans * Statutum quoddam quod Misam Lewensem inusitato nomine nuncupabat &c. Wikes, p. 63 f Rishanger, pp. 850-854. Matt. West. pp. 385-388, 393.

[a.d. 1264-1265. 220 winds delayed the enterprise so long that her mercenaries disbanded, there was reason to expect the renewal of her efforts with the aid of the pope and the French king, who openly espoused the cause of the captive princes. Thus menaced from without, and exposed within the kingdom to increasing peril from defection among the nobles of his own faction as well as the open hostility of the barons in the royal interest, the bold and subtle usurper was admonished of the necessity of strengthening his power in the popular attachment. With this view he had recourse to an expedient, which though doubtless dictated only by the momentary impulse of his selfish policy, became of lasting importance in hastening the growth of the British constitution. For the purpose of flattering the people and inviting their suffrages in support of his usurpation, he summoned two deputies from every county, city, and burgh in the realm, to meet the barons and prelates in Parliament; and he thus set an example of popular representa tion which, though springing from so illegal and inauspicious a source, was too congenial to the national wants and spirit to be ever after abandoned.* according to his engagement, he detained that prince, whose energetic and influential character he dreaded, a close prisoner, as well as young Edward and Henry. Shortly afterwards, a Parliament being summoned in the royal name, proposals were submitted to it, which, under the artful pretence of resigning the government into the hands of the king, provided that he should delegate the choice of his council and the whole executive administration of the realm to three persons, whose functions were to continue both during his own reign and that of his successor; and so far outnumbered were the royalists in Parliament, or so intimidated by the triumphant faction, that no resistance was attempted to the proposed enactments. As soon as these extraordinary terms were thus ratified, Leicester issued a writ in the royal name, appointing himself with the earl of Gloucester and the bishop of Exeter to execute their provisions ; and as that prelate was his creature, he thus engrossed in his hands the whole sovereign authority.* But if this scheme of flagrant usurpation was sufficient to blind the lower orders of the nation, who were the enthusiastic parti sans of Leicester and the willing dupes of his artifice, the eyes of the nobles even of his own faction were soon opened to the exorbitance of his ambition. As if now secure of his power, he began to throw off the mask of moderation. The insolence with which he imprudently treated his most powerful associates, the earls of Gloucester and Derby, and other barons of his party, excited their indignation ; and their disgust was, perhaps, even more deeply provoked by the disappointment of their hopes of sharing in the spoils of the crown and the estates of its vanquished adherents, which he rapa ciously engrossed to himself and his family. Meanwhile, Henry's queen, collecting a large army of foreign adventurers in Flan ders, threatened the kingdom with a formi dable invasion in support of the rights of her husband and son; and though contrary In this place any attempt to pursue an inquiry into the gradual composition of par liaments would, as a question of constitu tional law rather than of historical narration, be foreign to our immediate subject. It may, therefore, at present be sufficient to refer generally to the progress of events, which naturally prepared the way for the admission of the commons into Parliament, and sug gested to its author so important and mem orable an innovation in the features of that assembly. The fact itself that the represen tation of towns has no earlier origin than this measure of De Montfort, must now be considered as undeniably established as any other in our annals: although in the last two centuries the superior antiquity of the practice was the subject of violent debate * Rishanger, p. 854. Matt. West. pp. 388-390. Wikes, pp 63-66. Annales Waverleienses, pp. 216-218.

But though the first summons of citizens and burgesses to Parliament originated with De Montfort, the expedient thus adopted by a popular leader to answer a temporary pur pose, is not to be regarded as either a very original idea or a very violent change. It was merely the sudden extension of a prin ciple to which the nation had already become familiarized ; and there can be no doubt that the measure was suggested by a practice, approaching to popular representation, which had perhaps commenced in the preceding, but had been silently gaining ground throughout the actual reign. This was the frequent issue of the royal mandate for the election of knights in every county to attend the king in his great council, or parliament, of barons and knights. the minority of Henry III., that knights were openly elected by the suitors to the county courts ; not, indeed, to serve in Par liament, but to assess and collect aids granted to the crown in that baronial assembly.* From such a usage, once estab lished, it was an easy transition to summon these county representatives to the great council itself, there to assist in apportioning and consequently in granting the moneys which it was afterwards their business to levy. Accordingly, in the thirty-eighth year of the reign before us, we find a royal writ commanding expressly that two lawful and discreet knights should be chosen by the men of each county to come before the great council, and to determine with the knights of other comities what aid they will grant the king.f In the subsequent struggle between the royal and baronial factions, both, in the vicissitudes of their ascendancy, had recourse to the same measure of invit ing these knights from every county to Par liament to confer on the common affairs of the realm; and, finally, Leicester used the royal authority in issuing writs to each sheriff for the election of two knights of the shire for the same purpose. t. Without mooting a much-disputed ques tion whether or not these knights of the shire were originally substituted merely for, or chosen exclusively by, the mass of lesser tenants-in-chief of the crown, who were too numerous to exercise in person the right and duty, which they shared with the greater tenants by barony, of sitting in the king's council ; the appearance in Parliament of such a selection from the knighthood of the realm, however appointed, is a clear pre cedent of a virtual county representation. Thus, even two years before the signature of Magna Charta, an extant writ of King John, addressed to the sheriffs, directs that four discreet knights of each county should be sent to Oxford to confer with him regard ing the affairs of the kingdom. If it be uncertain whether these knights were to be chosen by the county or merely nominated by the sheriffs, two examples are afforded only seven and twelve years later, during So far he followed only an established custom; but the same instruments directed the sheriffs to cause two citizens or bur gesses to be chosen for every city and burgh within their counties: and thus \u2014 unwit tingly, as it may be believed, by its author \u2014 was completed that form of national representation which has endured to our times. The immense influence of this measure on the rising liberties of England cannot easily be exaggerated; and it is not wonderful, therefore, that its adoption by Leicester should have invested his memory with a lustre which has too much blinded attention to the darker shades of his charac ter. But to attribute to this act, as some writers have done, any share of pure and enlightened patriotism, or even to regard it * See Hallam, Middle Ages, vol. iii. p. 20, and the authori ties there cited. f Idem, p. 21. | Rymer, vol i. pp 802-804."], [260, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1265. 222 away from his keepers, found Mortimer and a body of royalists at hand to repel pursuit and protect his flight. The prince, received with joy by the earl of Gloucester and the royalists, whose strength preponderated in that part of the kingdom, was soon at the head of a powerful army, and Leicester was as shortly reduced to a state of great peril. His enemies breaking down the bridges and strongly guarding the fords of the Severn, cut off his communications with the south and east of England; and to complete his disasters, Edward surprised and defeated at Kenilworth the forces with which his son was hastening to his relief. With his usual skill in the field, the courageous baron had made vigorous efforts to extricate himself from his difficulties; but had only just suc ceeded in effecting the passage of the Severn when, on arriving near Evesham, instead of the reinforcements under his son which he expected to meet, Edward, Gloucester, and Mortimer, with their victorious army, appeared in sight (August 4). * as an original and far-sighted scheme for the extension of popular rights and the restriction of the power of the crown, is equally to betray a total absence of all cor rect insight into the character of the man and the features of the times. It may with much more truth be represented as one of those political improvements which, being prepared and suggested by the natural growth of congenial circumstances, could not have been long delayed, even if it had not been accelerated by the projects of an ambitious usurper. Nor can his sagacity with reason be extolled beyond the wisdom of that class of selfish politicians who may be sometimes rendered in the hands of Providence the unconscious and unworthy agents of its beneficent designs for the wel fare of human society.* The design of Leicester so far succeeded that he found the new Parliament a ready instrument of his daring schemes. But he was soon encompassed by difficulties and enmities more than counterbalancing the popular support which he thence derived. The open defection of the young and power ful earl of Gloucester from his party, which was provoked by his unbounded pretensions of engrossing the whole supreme authority, gave the first blow to his fortunes; and the appearance of that nobleman in arms, in conjunction with Roger de Mortimer and other royalists lords of the Welsh Marches, compelled him to hasten to Hereford, for the purpose of subduing this revolt, taking with him the king and Prince Edward captives in his train . But here a single event brought him to the crisis of his fate. A plan was successfully laid for the escape of Edward, while taking the air under guard near Here ford; and the prince suddenly galloping * The chronicler Thomas Wikes, an intelligent observer of the events of his times, assigns a motive to De Montfort, in summoning the commons to his famous Parliament, which probably contains the plain truth, and is obviously far more consistent with the whole tenour of that artful leader's policy than the refined conjectures of the later writers : \" Comes Leycestri\u00e6 caute pr\u00e6videns, ne forte magnates regni quos flexibiles et facile mutabiles reputavit, imo etiam inconstantes vocare non erubuit, contra se aliquid acceptare pr\u00e6sumerent, pr\u00e6meditatis cautelis disposuit majores deprimere et eornm potentias annihilare, &c, ut liberius et facilius vulgares sibi populos subjugaret,\" p. 06. As soon as the devoted noble discovered the truth, and observed the superior num bers and well-ordered array of the royalists, he gave himself up for lost, and the excla mation escaped him, \" May the Lord have mercy on our souls, for our bodies are theirs.\" But immediately recovering his usual serenity and valour, he betook him self to prayer, received the sacrament, and having endeavoured to animate his followers by the edifying spectacle of his pious confi dence, boldly led them to a furious attack upon the enemy. But his desperation and even his admirable qualities for command were overmatched by the great superior ity of numbers, and the skilful dispositions which his young rival was able to oppose to his efforts. His army was surrounded and totally defeated, or rather destroyed, for the victorious royalists barbarously refused to give any quarter.

The cruelty of the royalists allowed Leicester himself a happier lot than to survive, a cap tive, the annihilation of his party and the ruin of his fatal ambition. His horse being killed under him, and finding mercy denied, he fought desperately on foot, covered with wounds, until he fell lifeless on the body of one of his sons who had died defending him.* Such was the ferocity of the times and the quarrel, that his corse was mangled and mutilated in a manner too revolting to be described with decency; but if his ene mies thus glutted a barbarous hatred on his remains, his memory was long embalmed in the veneration of the people. The saintly austerity of his manners had commanded their religious respect, his apparent zeal for the public rights had won their affection; and in their eyes he died doubly a martyr, in the purity of his faith, and in the main tenance of their liberties. f The political master-spirit of his age and adopted country, the triumphant assertor of violated charters against a worthless monarch and his pro fligate favourites, the judgment of history might have perpetuated these honours on the name of Simon de Montfort, if the purity of his motives had corresponded with the superiority of his genius, or if, before success had unveiled the true character of his ambi tion, he had fallen in his first just resistance to a tyranny which he only subverted and survived, himself to usurp unconstitutional powers. With the fall of this extraordinary man was immediately extinguished the faction which he had led. The barons who had still adhered to his cause hastened in general to offer their submission to the crown ; and the commonalty, suddenly bereaved of their leader and champion before the immatured ex periment of representative union had taught them the secret of popular strength, had no alternative but a tame acquiescence in the re-establishment of the royal authority. The expanding talents of Prince Edward contri buted more than any other cause to restore and secure the peace of the kingdom; and his energy and prudence were equally con spicuous in overpowering resistance, and in composing the feuds and disorders which the civil wars had engendered. The most desperate of the defeated faction who, under Simon, son of their late chief, had taken refuge in the morasses of Cambridgeshire, were there besieged and compelled to sur render to his arms; the garrison of Kenil worth, after a very obstinate defence, was reduced by famine ; bands of outlaws, who ravaged the counties of Berks, Surrey, and Hants, were hunted down by the royal forces; and Adam de Gurdun, the leader of these insurgents, a man of surpassing per sonal strength and prowess, was captured in single combat and generously pardoned by the intrepid prince. The inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, who had been devoted parti zans of Leicester, and since his death had with their navy maintained a piratical war fare in the Channel, were first effectually \u2022 Rishanger, pp. 855, 856.

The relation of the monk of Melrose is more than usually communicative on English affairs at this juncture, probably owing to the share of his neighbours, the lords of the Scottish borders, in the civil war. Either the compiler, or more probably some transcriber of the chronicle, has, how ever, fallen into a strange mistake of post-dating the battle of Evesham, placing it in 1268. t \" Sicque labores finivit suos, vir ille magnificus Simon Comes,\" says Rishanger, the continuator of Matthew Paris, \" qui non solum sua sed se impendit prooppressione pauperum, assertioiie justiti\u00e6 et regni jure,\" p. 855. Matthew of Westminster, indeed, and Wikes view his character less favourably; the former plainly denouncing his treasonable usurpation, \" qui sibi et filiis suis dominium totius Angli\u00e6 usurpavit\" (p. 390), and tbe latter constantly describing him by such epithets as \" callidus, machinator, astutus\" (p. 67), &c., and severely stigmatizing his ambition and tyranny, his perfidy and rapacity. But the monastic annalists of St. Albans, Waverley, and Melrose all strive to outvie each other in panegyrics on the 6aintly qualities of this Cromwell of their church. \" Officiis divinis assidue interesse gaudens,\" adds Rishanger, \" constans suit in verbo, severus in vultu, maxime fidus in orationibus religiosorum, ecclesiasticis mag nam semper impendens reverentiam.\" So the chronicler of Waverley, \" Dominus vero Simon de Monteforti martyrium pro patri\u00e6 terr\u00e6 et regni reparatione et matris ecclesi\u00e6, ut credimus, consummavit gloriosum, p. 220.

No serious at tempt to disturb the peace of the kingdom was produced by his engagement in so distant an enterprise; and the judicious arrangements which he provided for the government, or the awe which his very name com manded, even in his absence, for the royal authority, secured unwonted tranqudlity for the close of a feeble and disorderly reign. Having used the precaution of compelling the earl of Gloucester, the most dangerous subject of the crown, by oath to follow him on his expedition, and having signalized his own departure by several popular acts, Edward hastened with a gallant train to join the crusading host with which Louis IX. of France had already sailed from the shores of Europe.* intimidated by the assault and capture of Winch elsea; and a politic offer of a confir mation of their privileges by Edward then easily induced them to return to their alle giance. Finally, a more dangerous revolt of the Londoners, instigated by the ambition of the turbulent and fickle earl of Gloucester, was quelled by a prompt appearance of a royal army under the walls of the capital ; and the earl himself was pardoned by the mediation of the king of the Romans. Throughout these troubles the triumph of the royal cause was tempered by its young leader with remarkable lenity and modera tion; the family of De Montfort, banished the realm, were almost the only offenders who suffered any punishment more severe than pecuniary fines; and, while even these penalties were not inflicted without the sanction of a Parliament, no attempt was made to violate the privileges established by the Great Charter, or to exceed the bounds of constitutional law.* Within little more than two years from the battle of Evesham, the peaceable settle ment of the kingdom had been so completely achieved that Prince Edward felt himself at liberty to indulge the chivalric bent of his own spirit, and the religious enthusiasm which he shared with his times, by assum ing the Cross. The adoption of this resolu tion by so politic a prince, at an epoch when the national troubles had just been appeased, when the licentious excitement produced by the long struggle of factions and the violence of civil war could hardly have subsided, and when the declining health and years of the old king rendered him more incapable than ever of maintaining his authority, has natu rally provoked the surprise of historians. But whether the purpose of Edward was prompted solely by a thirst of glory which overcame his prudence ; whether feelings of grateful piety for the recent recovery of the royal authority to his house urged him to engage in the cause then deemed, however falsely, most acceptable to heaven ; or whether After a revolutionary period of disorder and bloodshed, Bibars, styled also Al Bon ducdari or Bondocdar, the same Mameluke chieftain who had distinguished his ability in the defence of Egypt against St. Louis, was raised by the suffrages of his fellow soldiers to the throne of that kingdom ; and had now commenced an enterprising reign of seventeen years, which proved nearly fatal to the remains of the Christian power in Palestine. No sooner had he consolidated his authority in Egypt than he carried his arms into Syria, reduced the Mussulman states in that country into subjection, and poured the united forces of the Infidels into the Christian territories. In the open field, the numbers of the invaders rendered all resistance to their ravages hopeless ; but the few and scanty garrisons of the Latins made a gallant and desperate defence ; the Mili tary Orders gave many a noble example of heroism ; and by that singular admixture * Rishanger, pp. 856, 857 (bis).

But all the heroic efforts of the two Orders failed to arrest the progress of the Infidels, or to awaken the timely sympathy and succour of Europe. In the course of a few years, not only the inland castles of the two Orders, but C\u00e6sarea, Laodicea, Jaffa, and many maritime fort- resses, successively fell before the Mameluke arms; and the capture of Antioch, and the extinction of its Latin principality, which throughout the vicissitudes of the Crusades had hitherto preserved an obscure and unin- teresting existence, completed the triumph of Bondocdar. The fall of Antioch, which was basely surrendered without resistance, was attended by the massacre of ten or even forty thousand Christians; above one hun- dred thousand more were sold into slavery; and the once proud capital of Syria was abandoned to desolation and solitude.* Acre was preserved from the same fate only through the succour of the king of Cyprus, and the destruction of the Egyptian navy by the elements; and at this juncture the fall of that last Christian bulwark on the Syrian coast was suspended for twenty years by an expiring effort of the crusading spirit. f Accompanied by a train of knights and sol- diers who did not in all exceed one thousand men, Edward arrived in Louis' camp before Tunis in Africa to find that the French monarch had fallen a victim to the climate purpose by these untoward circumstances, Edward continued his voyage to the Holy Land. To recruit the strength of his gal- lant followers, he wintered in Sicily, and in the spring sailed to Acre. His arrival in that port once more rekindled the hopes of the desponding Latins ; and the long memory of the prowess of C\u0153ur de Lion had still retained sufficient influence in the East to appal the spirit of the Moslems at the intel- ligence, that another hero of the lion-hearted race approached to uphold the banner of the Cross. The Sultan Bondocdar, who had carried his ravages to the gates of Acre,* immediately retired in discouragement at the report; the broken remains of the Latin chivalry of Palestine eagerly gathered around the standard of Plantagenet ; and though the total force which the Christian state could muster, including his English followers, did not exceed seven thousand men, Edward boldly marshalled this scanty army for offen- sive hostilities against the Infidels. Ad- vancing from Acre, his achievements justified the general expectation both of his enter- prising courage and of his military skill. His first exploit, the surprise and defeat of a large body of the Mussulman forces in the field, was succeeded by the assault of Nazar- eth; and in the dreadful slaughter which preceded and followed the capture of that city, he equally emulated the chivalric valour and the fanatical cruelty of the earlier cham- pions of the Cross. f But the reduction of Nazareth closed his brief career of victory; his English followers fell rapid victims to the Syrian climate; and the hero himself was already stretched on a sick couch, when he narrowly escaped death from the poisoned dagger of an assassin.

The mutual neces sities of the sultan and of the English prince, produced the conclusion of a truce between the Infidels and the Christians in Palestine for ten years; and after a residence of four teen months in the Holy Land, and the accomplishment of a seasonable treaty, which had alone arrested the progress of the Mame luke arms and prolonged for another brief period the precarious existence of the Latin state, Edward sailed with his few surviving followers for his native land.* pated, is uncertain; but he easily obtained a private audience of Edward under pretence of a confidential mission; and while the prince was reading his credentials, he drew a hidden poniard, and aimed a blow at his intended victim. The attack was so unex pected, that Edward received several wounds before he recovered from the surprise; when, vigorously struggling with the assassin, he felled him to the floor, and instantly de spatched him with his own dagger. As the weapon had been poisoned, the life of the prince was for some time in imminent dan ger; but a leech in his service undertook to cut away the infected flesh from his wounds, and the operation was successful.* After his own restoration to health, the wasting effects of disease among his follow ers; the total inadequacy of his remaining force to any further enterprise of importance; the fadure of other Christian princes to de- Henry survived the departure of his valiant son rather more than two years, and at the age of sixty-four ended a useless life and a protracted reign, nominal indeed rather than real, of fifty-six years.t CHAPTER VII.

Nearly two years were suffered to elapse between the death of Henry III. and the arrival of his successor in England. This long interval was consumed by Edward I. in his voyage from the Holy Land to Italy; in a triumphal progress through the latter country, during which he was everywhere received with distinction by the pope, Greg ory X., by temporal princes and republics, and by clergy and laity, as the champion of the Cross; and in France, where he was detained principally by the affairs of his duchy of Guienne, for which he did homage to Philip III. His residence in France was also attended by two events of an opposite character: the satisfactory adjustment of some pecuniary disputes with the count of Flanders, as well as the restoration of the commercial intercourse between his subjects and the Flemings, which these differences had interupted ; and the previous acceptance \u2022None of the writers who were contemporary, or nearly so, with the event, knew anything of that beautiful fiction, the creation of a much later age, which ascribes the recovery of Edward to the affectionate devotion of his consort Eleanor in Bucking the venom from his wounds. \u2022Matt.

The English king, with a thousand armed attendants, met his challenger, who appeared with a train nearly twice as numerous; and whether from some treacherous design on the part of the count and his followers, or more probably through the suspicion of one and the fiery passion of both parties, the mimic game of war was soon turned into a real and sanguinary combat. The English, notwithstanding the disparity of array, were victorious; and the count, being unhorsed by Edward himself, was indignantly chas tised, as he lay on the ground, with the flat of his royal conqueror's sword.* obedient to the suggestions of policy, and generally under the strong influence of an excellent understanding. Though not less prone, therefore, than any of his predeces- sors to disregard the restraints of law in the exercise of the royal authority, and not more scrupulous in invading the rights of his subjects and eluding his promises of redress, he knew as well how to yield at necessity as to govern with vigour; and accordingly, displaying neither the insane tyranny of his grandsire nor the imbecde caprice of his father, and far above the pusillanimity of both, he preserved the respect, while he avoided to exasperate the resistance, of his people. The total disregard of equity which he showed in every transaction affecting his personal interest, whether with his own sub jects or with other states, attests how id he deserved that praise for a love of justice, which has sometimes been bestowed upon his memory. Indeed, his observance of the forms of law was most conspicuous in their perversion, on questions of feudal superior- ity, to purposes of wrong and usurpation. But, in his domestic policy, he saw the advantage of enforcing a strict execution and extensive amendment in the laws of the realm; if himself tyrannically disposed, he was anxious at least to protect the common- alty from baronial oppression ; and his ener- getic spirit enabled him to effect what his sound judgment dictated. His legislative enactments and his severe punishment of judicial corruption equally rendered his reign an epoch of striking improvement in the tenour and administration of the national laws ; and in these respects, whatever credit may be abstracted from the purity of his motives, he sufficiently merits the distinc- tion with which lawyers of later times have honoured his labours, in the title of the English Justinian. When Edward I. at length landed in England, he was welcomed by his people with the universal admiration and joy which the remembrance of his youthful virtues, the fame of his more recent adventures, and the promise of a glorious reign, were calcu lated to excite. The new king, who had attained his thirty-sixth year, was now in the full vigour of manhood and intellect. His _\u25a0 figure was tall and majestic, his frame in general well proportioned and graceful; he was an accomplished cavalier, and excelled in all the martial exercises of a chivalric age; and his prowess and skill in war had been proved on many signal occasions. f The qualities of his mind wdl best be depicted in the events of his reign. The darkest shades in his character were pro duced by the lust of dominion. Ambition was certainly his master passion ; and to this he was but too ready to sacrifice every con sideration of justice and humanity. But he was not wantonly cruel ; his temper, though irascible, was not vindictive; and his des potic and resolute spirit, while calmly inac cessible to any emotion of fear, was ever The ambition of Edward lent its colour ing to all the transactions of his reign. He evidently commenced and pursued his career of royalty with the settled resolution of maintaining the prescriptive usages of feudal tyranny against the chartered rights of his * Matt.

His real design was doubtless the mainte nance of his own independence, and that of his nation : the only error of this generous resolve was the miscalculation of his strength. Even in his own country, his power was disputed by the descendants of the Norman barons who had conquered and occupied great part of south Wales; his pretensions were regarded with hereditary hatred by Rees ap Meredith, the representative of a rival line of native princes ; and his very brother David, whose patrimony he is said to have withheld, was among the bitterest of his enemies. Whatever were the frater nal wrongs of this last chieftain, his revenge was treason to his country, and its unholy indulgence brought retributive ruin on himself.* subjects, and of extending his dominion over the whole island. In the first of these purposes he so signally failed, that not withstanding the vigour and ability of his administration, the concessions to which so powerful a monarch was reduced tended more to fix the secure foundations of con stitutional freedom, than all the immunities which had been extorted from the feeble misrule of his two immediate predecessors. In the other great design of his life he was partially successful; and though Scotland burst the chains which he had laboured to rivet by his policy and arms, the complete subjection and annexation of Wales to the English crown is the enduring monument of his reign. The full establishment of his sovereignty over that principality seems to have been the first object which engaged his attention after his return to England; and his views were materially assisted by the imprudence and dissensions of the Welsh chieftains. After a series of barbarous and sanguinary revolutions, of which any attempt to trace the vicissitudes would be equally perplexing and useless, their country, once divided into three states, North and South Wales, and the intermediate district of Powis, had now for several ages recognized the single though loose supremacy of the princes of Snowdon, or the northern divi sion; and these princes themselves had, in alternate periods of revolt and submission, denied and acknowledged as loose a feudal dependence upon the English crown, and engaged in turbulent contests and alliances with the English barons on their frontiers. Llewellyn ap Gryffyth, the reigning prince of Wales, had himself been closely con federated with the party of De Montfort, had fought on their side, and though he had made his submission after the fall of their leader, had refused, on the death of Henry III., to attend with the vassals of the English crown, to swear fealty to his suc cessor. When Edward, soon after his return to England, himself repeated this summons, the Welsh prince did not openly deny his obligation of homage; but he excused his In the unequal struggle which now com menced between the puissant and sagacious monarch of England and the impetuous prince of Wales, the former observed a show of moderation and a plausible regard to legal formalities, to which the rash resistance and impatient spirit of his un fortunate antagonist were presented in no favourable contrast. But it were vain and unjust to mystify, under the pretence of weighing the ostensible amount of provo cation, the real character of a quarrel, in which the specious assertion of legitimate right covered claims intolerably oppressive; and in which it is clear that one party fought only for independence, and the other for conquest. After ineffectually using every assurance of safety to induce Llew ellyn to trust himself in his power, Edward assembled his military vassals on the Welsh frontier ; and supported by the treasonable aid of Rees ap Meredith and David, pene trated into the recesses of the principality. In a short campaign, Llewellyn was inclosed within the barren though impregnable \u2022 Matt. West. pp. 407, 408. Hemingford, p. 4.

By the absolute cession of all the country between the rivers Dee and Con way; by the condition of holding the Isle of Anglesey, almost his only remaining possession, on an annual fee-rent to the English crown; by the surrender of host ages, the obligation to pay an enormous fine of fifty thousand pounds, and to make certain settlements on his traitorous brother \u2014 Llewellyn was permitted to purchase a peace, which would have reduced him to ruin, and which flattered his conqueror with the hope that his subjugation was complete.* brother David, who found that his fraternal treason had only served to dismember the territories to which, as Llewellyn was child less, he might himself have hoped to succeed. Edward, indeed, had bestowed some valu able fiefs upon him: but these tenures themselves became charged with grievances, when his liege lord caused some of his woods to be felled, and when several of his vassals were executed for murder by the Royal Justiciary Clifford, contrary to the provisions of their national laws. The brothers were drawn together by an attrac tion more powerful than those ties of kindred which they had dissevered \u2014 the bond of their common injuries. By their reunion, a general revolt of the Welsh was prepared; and by the people themselves the fearful inequality of the impending conflict was forgotten in the long exasperation of national hatred, the thirst of vengeance against their oppressors, the dictates of a rude but generous patriotism, or the wilder assurance of bardic prophesy.* But this treaty had the usual fate of engagements inflicted by tyranny and ex torted only from necessity. The utter inability of Llewellyn to discharge the fine and fee-rent occasioned their remission by the politic conqueror; and some other acts of grace ostentatiously proclaimed his lenity to his humbled vassal. Among these, the release of the Lady Elinor de Montfort, daughter to the late earl of Leicester, and the affianced bride of Llewellyn, betrays the spirit in which Edward had previously outraged the rights of the Welsh prince. For that lady, being intercepted by some Bristol vessels on her voyage from France to join her betrothed husband, was detained by the English monarch in confinement.! These imperfect reparations had little effect upon the exasperated and wounded pride of Llewellyn. The insolence of the royal officers made him daily experience the bitterness of feudal bondage; he brooded over his wrongs and humiliation; and his feelings were probably aggravated by the indignant complaints of his own people, who saw their prince and themselves deli vered over to the galling yoke of a detested race, and who reproached his submission as the cause of their sufferings. These sentiments were shared too late even by his The storm of insurrection burst upon the unsuspecting English with the surprise and capture by David of the castle of Hawarden, the residence of the king's justiciary, Clif ford ; who himself was wounded and carried prisoner to Snowdon, his knights and garri son being cruelly murdered. This act of bloody vengeance for the judicial conduct of Clifford was immediately followed by the appearance in arms of Llewellyn himself, and of various Welsh chieftains and their followers, who, pouring from their mountain fastnesses upon the English frontiers, com mitted every horrid atrocity of barbarian warfare. Edward, though completely un prepared for this revolt, evinced all his wonted vigour and activity in meeting the danger. He hastened to the Welsh marches, displayed the royal standard, and summon ing his military tenants to his support, soon drove the insurgents back into their moun tains. But he was now resolved utterly to crush under the weight of his power the * Matt. West. p. 408. Hemingford, pp. 4, 5. Walsing ham, pp. 46-48.

The original crime and subsequent cruelties of David may detract from the measure of historical sympathy which is due to his fate ; but his real offences cannot extenuate the iniquity of a sentence which condemned him, not for his earlier treason to his country, but for his later and redeeming efforts in her cause. Nor will the charge of ingratitude to an insidious protector, absolve the memory of Edward from the guilt of sacrificing to his ambition the life of a prince who owed him no natural allegiance, and whose revolt from him was an atonement to his race. But the pity which is denied to the fall of David may be freely extended to that of his more innocent brother. In the little that is known of his personal career, and in all that may be con jectured of its motives, Llewellyn appears as the consistent champion of the ancestral and national independence, which it was his birthright and his duty to uphold. If he had fallen alive into the power of his oppres sor, he would probably, without the same pretence, have been subjected to the same sentence of treason as David ; his head was exhibited on the Tower of London encircled, in derision of the Welsh prophecies, with a diadem either of silver or of ivy,* and this impotent mockery was the last unworthy insult offered to his remains by the victor, whose aggressions had goaded him to his ruin.f princes and nation, in whose submission he had fondly confided, and whose spirit he was taught could be quelled only by the total ex tinction of their independence. Advancing into the heart of Wales with an army, which everywhere overpowered the undisciplined resistance of the natives, he a second time reduced the island of Anglesey, though bravely defended by Llewellyn and David. His success, however, was not purchased without heavy losses, nor altogether un chequered by defeat : for a bridge of boats which he had thrown over the Menai, near the spot where that strait is now majestically spanned by a more glorious and enduring triumph of peaceful art, was destroyed by the tide, and a detachment of his forces, thus separated from the main body, was cut to pieces or drowned.* But this and other partial checks, sustained by the English arms, were shortly far outweighed by the death of Llewellyn. The Welsh prince having proceeded to South Wales to place himself at the head of his chieftains in that quarter, was surprised, while almost unattended and unarmed, near Built in Breconshire, by the English forces under Edmund Mortimer ; and there, as it should seem, in some casual encounter, and in ignorance of his quality, Llewellyn was slain by a knight named Adam Frankton.f It was in vain that David, after this catastrophe, which produced the submission of many of the Welsh chieftains, still for six months gallantly protracted a hopeless contest. He was ultimately deserted and betrayed by his own countrymen into the hands of Edward, who, in terms which indecently proclaimed that his doom was already sealed, summoned a parliament at Shrewsbury to try him by his peers for high treason as a vassal of the crown. He was condemned to be hanged, embowelled, and quartered ; and by this sentence, which Whatever was the injustice which pre ceded and attended the success of Edward, there can be no doubt that in the issue, his conquest of Wales, by the introduction of peace and order, proved equally beneficial to the subjugated race and to their English neighbours.

For this purpose he divided the principality into counties and hundreds ; he incorporated the principal towns with many commercial immunities ; and he laboured by every means in his power to wean the wild inhabitants of the mountains from their thirst for bloodshed and rapine to habits of industry and civilization. The effects of these sagacious and salutary meas ures were not indeed fully visible until long after the death of the politic conqueror ; and for above two centuries, until the manners of the people were gradually amalgamated with those of their more polished neigh bours, and prepared for a perfect community of laws and equality of rights with the dominant race, Wales continued to be more or less a prey to intestine violence and anar chy, from the oppressions of the English governors and lords of the marches, and from the lawless excesses of native marauders. But amidst these disorders incident to a half civilized and traditional state of society, the authority of the English government was safely though slowly matured. Deep-laid policy, as it is pretended, or more probably a fortunate accident, suggested to Edward an expedient for soothing the mortified pride of a conquered nation, and transferring the affections of an imaginative people to his own line, by the promise that he would give them a native born Welshman for their prince. His queen, Eleanor, having lain in at Carnarvon Castle, he presented her infant son Edward to the Welsh chieftains as the new prince of Wales ; and they received with joyful acclamations the announcement of an event which veiled their subjection in the fond boast or hope of recovered inde pendence. But the young Edward soon becoming, by the death of his elder brother Alfonso, heir to the English monarchy, his rights over that principality merged directly, on his accession to the throne, into those of his crown ; and from that period Wales has given a title to the eldest son of the kings of England* During several years after the final sub jugation of Wales, no event of importance disturbed the internal tranquillity of this island ; and the active mind of Edward found its chief occupation in continental politics. To these, however, it was only as a mediator that his attention was directed ; and it is an honourable evidence of the respect in which his character for ability and integrity was held by his contemporaries that, in the contest which had arisen for the crown of Sicily between the houses of Anjou and Arragon, his arbitration was solicited both by the competitors and by the king of France. But the friendly share of the English monarch in that quarrel belongs entirely to continental history ;| and soon after he had returned to his own dominions from the last of several mediatory visits to France, he became engaged by his ambition in a struggle of more dubious credit to his fame. This was the disputed succession to the throne of Scotland, which produced the most memorable events of his reign ; and which by the temptation, first of enlarging a claim of feudal superiority, and ultimately of usurping an immediate sovereignty over that kingdom, led him painfully to consume the remainder of his life in a project, equally unjust in itself, fruitful of crime and horror in its duration, and unsuccessful in its final result. But before we approach its details, it behoves us to offer some slight retrospect of the history of Scotland, which, from the scantiness of its authentic materials, as well \u2022 Walsingham, p. 52. It is almost needless to observe, that the tradition of the massacre of the Welsh bards by command of Edward, on which Gray founded one of the noblest lyric poems in our language, is entirely unsupported by historical evidence. Nor is the perpetration of such an atrocity at all consistent with the character of Edward, who, though sufficiently obdurate in his policy, was not addicted to acts of wanton or gratuitous cruelty; and it is only surprising that Hume, who seldom errs on the score of credulity, should have given modern currency to 60 improbable a fable, by its implicit reception into his text, on tbe apocryphal authority of a Welsh legend. f The progress of this long mediation may, however, be seen by the curious in Rymer, vol. i. pp. 665-700, &c."], [270, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1286-1289. 232 as its want of previous connection with the affairs of other countries, we have reserved for this place ; but which, from the period before us, we shall find sufficiently inter woven with the annals of England to blend in the same narrative.* strangely misunderstood and misrepresented, and the establishment of Malcolm Ceanmore on the throne of his fathers by the aid of an English army, have been already briefly told in Anglo-Saxon history. But the accession of Malcolm, whose reign is coeval with the Norman conquest of England, may here be noticed as the commencement of a new epoch in the Scot tish monarchy : memorable chiefly for the introduction of feudal tenures into its low land provinces, and the origin of its long struggle against the powerful sovereigns of foreign race who had succeeded the less formidable dynasty of the Anglo-Saxons. Many of the native English nobles found a refuge in Scotland from the Norman oppres sion ; and not a few of the followers them selves of the Conqueror, who for one reason or another had become dissatisfied with his government, sought establishments from the bounty of Malcolm. It seems to have been the policy of that prince to encourage the settlement in his dominions of both these classes of Saxon exiles and Norman adventurers ; he invested them with large portions of the demesnes of his crown, most probably upon obligations of military service, which foreign example and domestic neces sity might equally prompt ; and, though no certain evidence can be adduced of the precise period or means by which the feudal system was extended throughout Scotland, its growth may naturally be inferred by the creation of an order of royal tenants, from whom most of the lowland nobility of that kingdom afterwards claimed their descent. The disastrous wars in which Malcolm became engaged, both with the Conqueror and his son Rufus, and the issue of which we have elsewhere related, throw the only light that remains on the circumstances of his reign ; and his violent death, in his last inroad into England, left his kingdom a prey to fraternal usurpation and intestine anarchy, from which, in all its interests, it suffered greatly. Without recurring to a disputed question on the origin of the two great tribes of the Picts (or Caledonians) and the Scots, f who divided the possession of North Britain at the era of the Anglo-Saxon settlement in the southern division of the island, we may be contented to observe, with a national authority,^: the first dawn of historic light in the final prevalence of the Scots over the rival people, and their establishment of a rude monarchy over the whole country, to which their success gave the name of the kingdom of Scotland. Its real founder was Kenneth, distinguished as the second Scot tish prince of the same title, in whose reign the subjection of the Picts\u00a7 was completed ; but that event is only to be regarded as the first authentic fact in a long period of bar barism, of which little more of the national annals is preserved than the order of succes sion in the royal line, until the rise and fall of Macbeth. The overthrow of that ruler, whose real character and claims have been * The primitive history of Scotland is perhaps more thickly shrouded in fable than that of any of the European kingdoms. Its national chronicler, John de Fordun, however, in nowise distrusting his authorities, boldly deduces the pedi gree of the Scottish kings from an Egyptian Prince Geythelos, whose qualities and adventures he minutely describes, and who, surviving the overthrow of the host of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, married Scota, the daughter of that monarch, and gave her name to the race with whom he emigrated to the West !

Yet this, besides the improbability of the fact itself, is plainly contradicted by the habitual and familiar mention of the latter race, so late as the twelfth century, by Richard, the prior of Hexham, in Northumberland, in his history of the war of the Standard. The language of that monkish chronicler, whose local knowledge can hardly be dis puted, shows that the men of Galloway still bore, in his time the name of their Pictish ancestors, and had lost none of their ferocity. He describes the \" execrable forces \" of the northern invaders as composed, besides borderers, \" of Picts, who are commonly called Galwegians, and of Scots,\" and gives a fright ful picture of the enormities perpetrated by the first of these two races.

The advantages which that kingdom might have derived from intercourse with a people some degrees more removed from barbarism, were often interrupted by predatory and cruel wars; and the disorders incident to the general condition of society throughout Europe in those ages were aggravated in Scotland by the national ferocity which such border contests inflamed. The animosity between the two countries was little softened, even by occasional intercourse of a more amicable nature. The marriage of Malcolm Ceanmore with Margaret, sister of the Atheling Edgar, had mingled the blood of the ancient Saxon princes with that of the Scottish kings; and when, on the death of Malcolm, his brother Donald Bane usurped the throne, his children found an asylum with their maternal uncle, the Atheling, in England. The usurper had first to sustain the vicissitudes of a contest with his ille gitimate nephew Duncan, which terminated in the murder of the latter pretender: but the Atheling subsequently conducting an army into Scotland with the consent of the English king, William Rufus, succeeded in finally deposing Donald Bane, who died in prison; and placing his young relative and namesake Edgar, the rightful heir of Mal colm, on the throne. The reign of Edgar is remarkable only for the marriage of his sister, Matilda, or Maud, with Henry I. of England; an union, as we have formerly observed, extremely agreeable to the English subjects of that monarch, who, in so virtuous and beautiful a princess \u2014 long affectionately remembered among them as \"good Queen Molde\" \u2014 equally revered her personal quali ties and her descent from the royal Saxon line.* defeat of the Scottish prince in the great battle of the Standard, his inroads long continued to multiply the disasters of the civil wars which desolated England. In the next age his grandson, William the Lion, also mingled in the internal troubles of the southern kingdom, by abetting the sons of Henry II. in their unnatural rebellion against their father: but the Scottish mon arch, as we have seen, paid dearly for this interference when he fell a captive into the hands of Henry, and was obliged to purchase his release by acknowledging the English monarch as his liege lord. From these obli gations, indeed, he was afterwards released by Richard I. ; not, however, through any gratuitous generosity of spirit in that prince, as some writers have asserted, but in con sideration only of a large pecuniary supply to his necessities. During the succeeding English reign of John, the Scottish king, Alexander II., pursued the usual policy of his house by aiding the confederate barons against their sovereign: but the establish ment of Henry III. on the throne introduced a long period of peace between the two countries, which was only slightly dis turbed, without actual hostilities, by disputes respecting homage, and twice cemented by the marriage of Alexander and of his son of the same name, with the sister and the daughter of the English monarch. The long reign of Alexander III., an intrepid, active, and excellent prince, was distinguished by his victorious repulse of a Danish and Norwegian invasion, and by his annexation of the Hebrides to the Scottish crown. But his death was as disastrous as his life had been useful to his country. Both his two sons, and his only daughter, who was united to Eric king of Norway, preceded him to the grave; andean infant, Margaret, the issue of that marriage, was the sole lineal descendant who survived him. On this grandchild, before his decease, he had solemnly settled the crown ; and as soon as he expired, her title was acknow ledged by the States of the Realm, a regency was appointed, and her father Eric was in- This family alliance of the two crowns, however, had little other influence than to serve as a pretext in the next English reign for the interference of David I. in behalf of the rights of his niece, the Empress Matilda, and her son; and, notwithstanding the signal \u2022 See p. 134. 30"], [272, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND {a.d. 1291. 234 vited to send her to Scotland. In his anxiety to secure her interests, that prince despatched an embassy to the English court, to solicit the powerful protection of Edward I. ; deputies from the Scottish regency at- tended for the same purpose, and a treaty was signed at Salisbury \u2014 by which Eric bound himself to commit his daughter into the hands of Edward, unshackled by any matrimonial contract, Edward to restore her in the same condition to her subjects when- ever the state of Scotland should render such a measure safe, and her subjects on their part not to bestow her hand without the joint approbation of her father and the king of England. The real design of Edward in this treaty was soon after revealed by his obtaining the consent of the other contracting parties to marry the young queen of Scots, under a papal dis pensation, with ample security for the liberties of her kingdom, to her cousin, his eldest son. But this wise and advantageous project, of which the success might have hastened by three centuries the peaceful and equitable union of the two crowns, and have prevented a long series of international bloodshed and calamity, was unhappily de feated by the death of Margaret. That infant princess, the Maid of Norway as she was termed, sickened and died in the Orkneys on her voyage from her native land ; and through her death Scotland was overwhelmed by all the evils of a disputed succession and a foreign tyranny.* would possess the power of enforcing a judgment, they overlooked the obvious conclusion that the same power might be exerted to invade their common rights : if they relied upon his reputation for equity, they forgot that it had never been tried in the balance against his ambition. They had shortly sufficient reason to repent of their confidence. Edward had no sooner received the welcome invitation to interfere in the affairs of Scotland, than he seems deliber- ately to have entered on the design of embracing this occasion, first to establish a title of feudal superiority, and afterwards to obtain a complete and immediate dominion over the whole kingdom. In furtherance of these purposes, he appointed a meeting with the Scottish prelates and barons, to decide the succession to their crown, at the border castle of Norham, on the Tweed ; and before he proceeded thither himself, he summoned all the royal vassals of the northern English counties to attend his person, and appeared at the head of an imposing military force.* He then opened the conferences by an nouncing to the astonished nobles of Scot land that, before he could enter on the business of the succession, he must require on their part a formal recognition of his own ancient rights as lord paramount of their kingdom. The unjust and unexpected nature of this claim is at once attested by the surprise with which it was received. In their first consternation the Scotch, sur rounded as they were by the warlike array of the English, could only request time for deliberation ; and a delay of three weeks was granted by Edward, who was too politic to put the appearance of constraint upon their actions, and who knew that, overhancr ing their frontiers with a powerful military array, and having the interests of all their factions in his hands, he might safely calcu late upon the disunion and the fears of the whole body. The result justified his saga city. Even at the expiration of the given time, indeed, the re-assembled States of As soon as the Scottish throne became vacant, the peace of the kingdom was threatened by the rival claims of no fewer than thirteen pretenders to its crown ; and the States of the Realm, distracted by the apprehension of a complicated civil war, or more probably swayed by the intrigues of the English monarch, adopted the fatal expedient of submitting the impending con troversy to his decision. If they adopted the plausible argument that no other umpire \u2022 Rymer, vol. i. pp. 700, 713, 719-721, 730, 735-738, 741 ; documents which throw the clearest light upon every stage in the negotiations for the marriage of the Scottish queen \u2022 Hemingford, pp. 30, 31.

The obscure evidence of an occa sional and partial subjection of Scottish princes to the Anglo-Saxon kings, may safely be dismissed from the inquiry ; both as inconclusive in itself, and as appertaining, at all events, to a period during which neither the substance nor the formalities of feudal vassalage can be clearly discerned in either country. But after the Norman conquest of England we are presented with a series of transactions, which record the performance of homage by the Scottish kings to the victorious dynasty. To William the Conqueror, Malcolm Ccanmore was certainly reduced to offer a general submission ; and at least one contemporary chronicler dis tinctly asserts that he did homage and swore fealty to the Norman.* It can scarcely be necessary to dwell at much length upon the real character of these proceedings. But as the right of the English king to the feudal superiority which he claimed over the Scottish crown has been made a subject of obstinate contention between historians of the two countries, some conclusion on the case may here be expected. By most writers on each side the question has been argued in a spirit of legal subtilty, too nearly akin to that in which Edward advanced his pretensions ; as if their justice were to be determined by the mere forms of precedent and prescrip tion. The English monarch asserted that the kings of .Scotland had frequently, both before and since the Norman conquest, done homage for their crown to his predecessors : tbe Scots maintained that the homage paid by their sovereigns had been rendered only for lands which they held in England. To Whether this homage was renewed to William Rufus seems more questionable ; f but in the succeeding English reign the circumstances arose which ultimately com plicated the feudal relations between the two royal houses. By his acquisition of the earldom of Huntingdon, in England, David I. had become the undoubted vassal of the English crown ; and repeatedly per forming service as such, the uncertain and disputed character of the homage which he rendered in that capacity, appears to have been the real origin of the subsequent claims of feudal superiority arrogated by the kings of England. On the one hand it has been declared that this homage was per formed for his English earldom solely ; on * Hemingford. pp. 31-33. Walsingham, pp. 56, 57. Rymer, pp. 755, 756. The very declaration which Edward, in the first of these instruments, compelled the competitors for the Scottish throne to sign, that they admitted his superiority without constraint, holds a language of which, as a modern historian has shrewdly observed, the necessity generally proves the falsehood \u2014 \"Nous, de nostre propre volont&, saunz nul manere de force ou destresce, voloms otrioms et grantoms de receyure droit devaunt lui com soverayn seignor de la terre,\" &c. The interesting fact has recently been brought to light by Dr. Burton that, while the prelates and nobles of Scotland made no attempt to impugn Edward's claim to be the superior of the kingdom, the community (communilas) gave in an answer in writing, which the English king and his advisers declared to be \" not to the point.\" \u2022 \" Ultra progrediens inclytus Rex Willielmus in Scotiam, earn sibi subjecit, et Malcolmum regem ejus sibi hominium, facere et fidelitatem jurare apud Abernithi coegit.\" Ingulphus (apud Gale, Rernm Anglican. Script, vol. i. p. 79). t On a summons from William II., Malcolm attended him at Gloucester: but refused, says Florence of Worcester, to do him right there, alleging that the same had never been done by Scottish kings, except within their own territories: \"Nisi in regnorum suorum confiniis, ubi reges Scotorum erant soliti rectitudinem facere regibus Anglorum,\" &c. Florentius Wigorn (Ed. Francofurti, 1601), p. 645. But it is doubtful whether rectitudinem facere meant to perform homage for the Scottish kingdom."], [274, "[a.d. 1291. 236 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. And, finally, even Edward himself, in the treaty of marriage between his son and the young queen of Scots, had guaranteed, in the strongest terms for which language could be found, the entire freedom of her kingdom from all subjection whatever.* Upon the whole, therefore, it is manifest that while some of the Scottish princes had been compelled by force of arms to acknow ledge a general superiority in the English crown, they had as often indignantly repu diated this constrained vassalage, and had habitually rendered and freely confessed no other homage as due than for their English lands ; that, although the claim of the English crown to a feudal superiority over that of Scotland was not new, the resistance was both as old and as recent as the preten sion ; that, when it suited the purpose of Edward to conciliate the minds of the Scots, he had tacitly abandoned so offensive an assumption ; and that, accordingly, in the very last treaty which he had negotiated between the two countries, the perfect equality and independence of the weaker state had been stipidated with the utmost care and precision to satisfy the national jealousy. But even if the balance of legal evidence were more favourable to the pre tensions of Edward, the question would surely remain to be argued on higher mention is made of any feudal service due for his kingdom of Scotland ; and in other instruments (pp. 327, 329) nearly twenty years later, Henry II. engages to his son-in-law, Alexander III., to do nothing which shall prejudice his rights or the liberties of his realm \u2014 \"Nee aliquid faciemus aut fieri permittemus per quod dicto regi ant regno suo, aut libertatibus suis regiis, possit aliquid pr\u00e6judicium generari.\" This is not the language of feudal superiority. The trans- actions with the two Alexanders are related by Matt. Paris, pp. 568 and 716; and, on the latter occasion, the historian certainly adds that homage for their kingdom had been done by preceding Scottish princes. \"Et cum super hoc conveniretur rex Scoti\u00e6, ut ratione regni Scoti\u00e6 faceret homagium et fideli tatem cum ligantia domino suo regi Anglorum, sicut fecerunt pr\u00e6decessores sui regibus Anglorum, prout evidenter in Chronicis locis multis scribitur, respondit rex Scoti\u00e6,\" &c. * Rymer, vol. i. p. 735. \"Wholly, freely, absolutely, and without any subjection,\" &c; and again, \"The kingdom of Scotland must remain separate, distinct, and free in itself, without any subjection,\" &c, are some of the expressions in the treaty by which the independence of Scotland was guar anteed. If the phrase which follows, the right of him who is called our lord being reserved (Edward), was artfully designed to reserve a pretension of feudal superiority, which Edward dared not then advance, and which the context of the treaty might fairly be interpreted to disclaim, this very reservation is only another proof of his bad faith. the other, that it was for his Scottish crown. The question was still further embarrassed when, during the troubles of Stephen's usurpation, David claimed the earldom of Northumberland in right of his English wife, and Cumberland and West moreland as ancient dependencies of his crown : for, on receiving the investiture of the former county from Stephen, the heir of the Scottish sovereign became his liege man for these English lands. By Henry II., at the commencement of his vigorous reign, Malcolm IV., the successor of David, was compelled to resign the three northern counties, and to receive in exchange the earldom of Huntingdon, for which he did homage, and on various occasions rendered the same feudal services as other vassals of the English crown.* But there is nothing in any of these cir cumstances which indicates any subjection in the kingdom of Scotland itself; and the very advantage which Henry II. afterwards extorted from his captive, William the Lion, by making a general oath of fealty the price of his liberation, proves that such absolute allegiance had not previously been admitted. And the feudal superiority thus acquired was at least formally renounced by the treaty in which William afterwards purchased from Richard I. a release from its humiliating obligations.! From that period no satis factory proof can be adduced of homage rendered by William the Lion or his suc cessors for their crown ; and though they repeatedly performed the ceremony, it was always maintained to be for their English lands only. Some submissions, indeed, which William himself was compelled to make to John of England, may be con strued into a general recognition of feudal superiority; but when a claim of homage for the Scottish crown was founded upon them by Henry III., both Alexander II. and his son of the same name constantly denied the fact, and resisted the demand. t. * Hoveden (apud Savile, Script, post Bedam), p. 491, &c. t Rymer, vol i. p. 50 X In Rymer, vol. i. p. 233, in a charter by which Alex ander II. agrees to do homage for certain English lands, no"], [275, "A.D. 1291.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 237 grounds ; nor are the inherent rights of an unsubjugated and sovereign nation to exemption from foreign bondage to be tried by the quibbles of feudal law, or the empty pageantry of feudal homage. When stripped of the subtle formalities in which Edward shrouded his dishonest purpose, his whole conduct in advancing his claims at such a juncture was nothing less than an iniquitous scheme of usurpation, of which no sophistry can disguise the fraud, or ex tenuate the injustice. question of the succession, and of thus rendering his own designing interference the more needful and irresistible.* The only real question of right lay among the three remaining claimants, who could prove a common descent from David, earl of Huntingdon, a younger brother of William the Lion, by the extinction of whose posterity the throne had become vacant. David had three daughters, Mar- garet, Isabella, and Ada, whose representa- tives respectively were John Baliol, lord of Galloway, Robert Brus or Bruce, lord of Annandale, and John Hastings, lord of Abergavenny \u2014 all of them, it is remarkable, nobles of Norman blood by the paternal side, and being enfeoffed of estates in England as well as in Scotland, subjects of Edward. Baliol, as grandson of the eldest sister, challenged the sole right of regal succession : but Bruce, being the son of Isabella, the second, advanced the pica that he was nearer in blood than his rival to their common ancestor ; that his title was supported by the custom of succession to the Scottish crown, by which the brother, as nearest in degree, was preferred to the son of the deceased king ; and, especially, that his right to the crown had been recog- nized by the Estates of the realm in the reign of Alexander II., who had presented him to the nobles and magnates of Scotland as his lawful heir, and that the whole of them had then, by the king's command, taken the oath of fealty to Bruce. Hastings, as grand- son of the youngest sister, could only main- tain that the kingdom of Scotland, like other fiefs, on failure of heirs male, was equally divisible among daughters and their repre- sentatives, and that he was therefore entitled to a third part of the inheritance. On the first of these conflicting pretensions, Edward decided, after the concurrent judgment of the parliaments both of England and Scot land, that the right of primogeniture was preferable to that of proximity of descent \u2014 a conclusion in favour of Baliol. With As soon as the English monarch had secured a recognition of this unrighteous claim of superiority over the Scottish crown from all the pretenders to its inheritance, he proceeded safely and at leisure, as feudal lord of the kingdom, to institute the pro- posed examination into their respective claims. It was agreed that this inquiry should be conducted by eighty Scottish arbitrators, named in equal numbers by two leading parties among the competitors, and twenty-four English commissioners appointed by Edward himself. After the proceedings before this court bad been protracted with intermissions for nearly sixteen months, Edward at last pronounced judgment. On the futility of the claims set up by ten out of thirteen pretenders, no doubt could be entertained. Among their number was Eric, king of Norway, as heir general of his daughter, a title obviously inadmissible ; and of nine others, though all asserting a descent from the royal line, the right was equally untenable through the illegitimacy or remoteness of its origin. So incapable, indeed, were the pretensions of these nine of being supported on any laws of inheritance recognized even by the vague and uncertain opinions of that age, that they all voluntarily withdrew from the prosecution of their suit before the close of the inquiry ; and it is difficult to reject the suspicion of a great historian, that their original appearance in the list of com- petitors is attributable solely to secret encouragement given to them by Edward, for the purpose of perplexing the whole * Hume, History of England (8vo ed. London, 1803), vol. ii. p. 480."], [276, "238 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1292-1293. respect to the second pretension, on which Bruce now united with Hastings to demand a partition of the kingdom, it was deter mined that Scotland, being a royalty, was indivisible, and that the principles of its inheritance could not be identified with those of inferior fiefs.* But as soon as the new king of Scots, after the performance of liege homage at Newcastle, had taken possession of his crown, the English monarch lost no oppor- tunity of showing his determination to interpret the feudal dependence which he had exacted into an effective and immediate allegiance. It has been doubted, indeed, whether by such procedure, Edward really intended, as has sometimes been imagined, to goad his vassal to rebellion, that he might make his contumacy a pretext for depriving him of his fief; and it seems not impro- bable that, as he took care not to exceed the authority which was vested by the feudal law in the superior lord, he anticipated no resistance, and designed only to habituate Baliol, while he was yet newly installed in his regal office, to a subjection which was the necessary result of his sworn fealty. But whatever were the motives of Edward, the authority which he had resolved to enforce was not the less galling for its agreement with the forms of feudal law ; and nothing can place the real character of his usurpation in a stronger light than the simple fact that none of his predecessors had ever attempted to exercise the jurisdic- tion in Scottish affairs to which he now pretended, and which would only have been the usual consequences of a feudal depen- dence.* For no legal principle was more clearly recognized than the right of the superior lord to receive and determine appeals from the sub-vassals of his feuda tory ; yet no former king of England had ever affected to afford protection to the aggrieved subjects of the Scottish crown, as suitors in his court, against their own sovereign. Edward, however, now evi dently encouraged such appeals : for, in the first year of Baliol's reign, that prince \u2022 To show the novelty of Edward's pretensions, it is suffi cient to contrast the tenour of his negotiations on Scottish affairs in Rymer before and after the death of the Maid of Norway. In the treaty for the marriage of his son with that young queen, though all his titles are fully enumerated, no reference to his claim of feudal superiority over Scotland is to be found among them. But ever after the conferences at Norham, his formal style is carefully enunciated as \" Edwardus, Dei Gratia, Rex Angli\u00e6, Doininus Hyberni\u00e6, Dux Aquitani\u00e6, et superior Dominus Regni Scoti\u00e6.\" Baliol was therefore declared the true and sole heir to the kingdom ; nor can the justice of both decisions be impeached. Indeed, the impartiality of Edward in this judgment is the most defensible and the fairest portion of his conduct throughout the Scottish transactions of his reign. He could hardly have been actuated, as he has sometimes been accused, in deciding in favour of Baliol by any expectation of peculiar subserviency from that nobleman, who had been the slowest of all the claim ants, while his rival Bruce had been the first, to acknowledge the feudal superiority of the English crown over that of Scotland. Nor can it be doubted that, by declaring the Scottish kingdom divisible among the three descendants of David, earl of Huntingdon, he might have made its partition among as many vassals more favourable to the estab lishment of his effective sovereignty over the whole island, than by bestowing the undivided northern realm upon a single royal feudatory. It may therefore rather be concluded that, by the habitual attach ment of his mind to the maintenance of legal principles, he sought to do right among the competitors, than that he had any more sinister motives ; and that, con fident in his own strength to assert and extend the pretensions of feudal superiority which all the pretenders had formally ac knowledged, he was little solicitous about the event. And, as soon as Baliol had sworn fealty to him for his new kingdom, he acted with the same regard to the cus toms of feudal law, by delivering up to his vassal the Scottish castles, which he had held during the abeyance of the fiefs * Rymer, vol. i pp. 762-784, an instrument fully record ing the whole process by which the right of succesMon to the Scottish crown was tried. t Ibid. vol. i pp. 780-785."], [277, "A.D. 1293-1295.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 239 was cited no fewer than four times to answer pleas of his vassals before his liece lord.* When Baliol remonstrated against this treatment, and reminded Edward that by treaty no Scottish subject was to be compelled to answer in an English court for any act done in Scotland, the English king replied with unblushing effrontery that he did not intend to be bound by a promise which had been made merely to suit his own convenience. was brought to issue by an appeal from Macduff, earl of Fife, who, having been seised of certain lands by a judgment of Edward during the vacancy of the throne, had since been dispossessed by Baliol and his council and committed to prison, and who had now carried his suit into the English courts. Baliol being in conse quence cited to answer both for this alleged wrong to his vassal and for contempt of the previous judgment of their common lord, appeared personally, after some demur, before Edward and his parliament ; and, while he disavowed all intention of con tempt, boldly protested that he was not bound to plead to the appeal, as on a matter touching the rights both of his crown and his people. Edward arrogantly overruled his objection, declared him liable to amerce ment both for his imprisonment of Macduff and his refusal to plead, and would only grant him a delay of judgment to consult his subjects. Baliol retired in disgust to his own kingdom, and thenceforth sought only to gain time, by contriving to get judgment further adjourned, until he should find a favourable opportunity for throwing off altogether the yoke of his haughty oppressor.* Into tbe merits of these disputes between the Scottish king and his subjects it would be useless to inquire ; but it is obvious that their frequent reference to Edward tended to bring the authority of Baliol into utter contempt, and that the novel indignities to which their king was thus exposed must have been keenly felt, if not by himself, at least by a free and high-spirited nation. Baliol himself, indeed, has often been re- presented by national writers, who cannot forgive the disgrace which attended his elevation to the throne, as a man of a feeble and craven nature ; but his personal conduct in his disputes with Edward, in the outset at least of his reign, betrayed no lack of spirit, and seems to have been dictated by a temper impetuous and inconstant rather than cowardly. It was the misfortune of his position to be surrounded by a turbulent nobility, but recently his equals, who bore with the same impatience his own ill- established authority and the pretensions of, Edward ; and who, conspiring in his council, with power far superior to his unsupported influence, encroached on his regal functions, and hurried him upon a struggle in which they were prepared to desert him at the first reverse of fortune. Urged, therefore, both by the public re- proach of his council and people, and by his own shame at the degradation to which his vassalage had reduced the ancient indc- pendence of the Scottish kingdom, the new sovereign prepared to oppose a resistance to Edward's jurisdiction, which appears to have been little expected. The question Such an occasion he at length found in a rupture which at this juncture took place between France and England. Edward and Philip had long regarded each other with a jealous eye, and at length a paltry broil which took place between some Eng lish and French sailors gave rise to san guinary hostilities, but without any open declaration of war. Philip availed himself of what seemed a favourable opportunity to exercise his rights of jurisdiction to the injury of his powerful enemy. It is worthy of remark that, in this tran saction, Philip made the same oppressive use of his feudal superiority over Edward, by citing him before his court as duke of Aquitaine, which the English king himself had exerted against Baliol. There was, indeed, this essential difference be- * Ibid pp. 786-788. \u2022 Rymer, pp. 787-789, 792."], [278, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. }>.d. 1293-1295. 240 tween the conduct of the two superior lords, that Philip was exercising a right of citation on a vassalage, of which the prescriptive and always recognized title was unquestionable; while the pretensions of Edward over Scotland were as ill founded, as the abuse of power in both instances was unjust. In another point of view, the temporary loss of Guienne is the transaction in the reign of Edward most discreditable to his political sagacity. For he suffered himself to be completely outwitted by the French king, who offered to accommodate the quarrel if Guienne, merely to satisfy his honour, were formally surrendered to him for forty days, at the expiration of which it should be restored; but no sooner had he induced Edward thus to deliver the duchy, with its fortresses, into his hands, than with shameless per- fidy he refused to restore it, and declared the fief forfeited by the non-appearance of his royal vassal to answer the original citation. The egregious credulity with which the English king fell into the snare, is so inconsistent with his usual character, that it can be explained only by the anxiety to rivet his dominion over Scotland, which engrossed all his attention, and rendered him comparatively indifferent to the affairs of a transmarine province.* suited her convenience. By this treaty it was, among other things, agreed, that if Edward embarked his forces in the French war, Baliol should avail himself of their absence to ravage the English borders; and that if, on the other hand, Edward in- vaded Scotland, Philip should make a diver- sion against the most assailable part of his territories.* The watchful penetration of Edward speedily suspected or discovered the existence of this treaty; and assembling an army on the Scottish frontiers, as soon as he had quelled an insurrection in Wales,f he summoned Baliol, as his vassal, to attend him in a contemplated expedition to Guienne, or to surrender to him, during his own absence on that enterprise, several border castles as pledges of fidelity. On the failure of Baliol to comply with either demand, Edward advanced northward; and some desultory hostilities on the part of the Scots enabled him to throw the reproach of the first aggression on a people who had in reality armed for the defence of their national liberties. The first exploit of the English king was the capture of the town and castle of Berwick, after a desperate resistance, which so enraged him that he gave up the inhabitants to an indiscrimi- nate massacre, that lasted for two days, during which the streets ran with blood. Before leaving Berwick Edward received, on the 5th of April, from Baliol, in his own name and that of his nobles, a renun ciation of his allegiance, on the ground of the insults offered to himself, and the pre vious injuries inflicted upon his subjects. The disgrace, however, with which Ed ward felt that his reputation was covered by the loss of Guienne, impelled him to make vigorous efforts for the recovery of that duchy; and his occupation in a foreign war suggested to Baliol or his advisers the favourable moment for recovering their national independence. The common in terests of the French and Scottish kings led to the conclusion of a secret treaty between them : the first, it may be observed, of a long series of alliances, through which, for nearly three centuries, France employed Scotland in harassing her English enemies; and wherein she alternately supported and abandoned her northern auxiliary as best \" See the documents relative to the affair of Guienne in Rymer, pp. 793-796, 805, 807, &c __ * Rymer, pp. 830, 831. By the same treaty a contract of marriage was made between the eldest son of Baliol and the niece of the French king. f This Welsh insurrection was of a serious nature, and would appear to have been a national, though ill-concerted effort, to throw off the English yoke. Its suppression was not effected without the presence of the king himself, who, in the course of his expedition, being cut off Lorn his supplies, was, for a time, reduced to some peril and distress, and oblig. d to subsist on the rud-st fare: \"so that he drank water mixed with honey, and fed on bread and salt meat.\" Edward, howeier, finally overpowered the insurgents with his usual skill and fortune ; and by a judicious union of severity and mercy, so deterred or disinclined the Welsh chieftains and people from further revolt, that his government was after wards little disturbed.

But since he will not come to us, we must go to him.\" The earl of Surrey was immediately de spatched with a powerful force to besiege the castle of Dunbar, the key of the eastern marches. A numerous Scottish army assem bled for the relief of this important fortress, and took up a strong position on an emi nence in its vicinity. But having unfortu nately mistaken a movement of the enemy for a retreat, they rushed down precipitately to the encounter, and were defeated with great slaughter. Next day the castle of Dunbar surrendered at discretion, and this example was speedily followed by the strong fortresses of Roxburgh, Dumbarton, Jed burgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling. was justly deprived of his crown. Three days after this base submission he resigned his kingdom into the hands of Edward himself, at the castle of Brechin. After this humiliating ceremony Baliol and his eldest son were sent to London, where they re mained for three years in the Tower. Thus terminated the short and troubled reign of John Baliol. The fallen monarch was ultimately released in 1299, and conveyed to his ancestral estate of Bailleul in Nor mandy, where he ended his days (1314) in an obscurity far happier, probably, than his troubled and ephemeral royalty. With the overthrow of Baliol, Edward had reason to believe that he had com pleted the subjugation of Scotland. In that country no enemy any longer opposed him in the field; and no voice dared to protest against his assumption of the for feited crown. At Berwick he received the homage and fealty of all the prelates, barons, and other tenants in chief, and burgher deputies of the realm; and so universal was the submission as to embrace the representatives of almost every noble family, and of every order in the state. The conqueror, whatever may be thought of his cause, used his success with modera tion. He persecuted no individual, confis cated no property, and changed no existing tenure, or law, or public usage. He showed only a necessary determination to secure his power by placing English garrisons in the royal fortresses, and a jealous anxiety to extinguish the memorials of the national independence, by such acts as the destruc tion or abstraction of archives, and the removal to Westminster of the famous Black Rood of Scotland, which was be lieved to contain a portion of the true cross, as well as of the ancient stone seat, on which the Scottish kings had been wont to sit at their coronation, and to which their people had been taught to attach a superstitious reverence as the palladium of the monarchy.* After such precautions of The battle of Dunbar for the present decided the fate of Scotland. Baliol retired beyond the Tay with the remains of his defeated and dispirited army ; and per ceiving that further resistance to the power of the invader was hopeless, he sent a mes sage to Edward, who had now reached Perth in his triumphant progress through the kingdom, offering submission, and im ploring mercy. He was informed that this would be granted him only on condition that he would make an unconditional sur render of his kingdom to the English monarch, accompanied by a public acknow ledgement of the guilt of his rebellion. To these humiliating terms Baliol sub mitted. The degrading ceremonial of his abdication and penitence took place in the churchyard of Stracathro, near Mon trose, on the 7th of July, 1296, in the presence of the bishop of Durham and the barons of England. He was first of all divested of his royal robes, crown, and sceptre; and then, dressed only in his shirt and drawers, with a white rod in his hand, he confessed that, misled by evil and false counsel, he had grievously offended his liege lord, and, recapitulating his various transgressions, he acknowledged that^he^ * This was the celebrated Stone of Destiny which, accoid ing to fabulous chroniclers, Ga'helus, the Spanish king, a :;i"], [280, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

This noble-minded patriot, who first taught the Scottish people the secret of their own strength, and aroused a spirit of resistance to oppression which ulti mately triumphed, in spite of the most tremendous odds, over all the power of the usurper, was the second son of Sir Malcolm Wallace, of Elderslie, near Pais ley, the head of an ancient family of Anglo-Norman descent, which settled in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire in the reign of David I.* When Wallace was very young, Sir Malcolm and his eldest son were slain in one of the skirmishes of the times, and the patriot was educated at Dunipace, in Stirlingshire, by his uncle, a wealthy ecclesiastic, by whom the love of freedom and of his country was early instilled into his mind. This patriotic priest, it is said, \" deplored the calamities of his country, and was never weary of extolling the sweets of liberty, and lament ing the miseries of dependence.\" At a very early period of his life Wallace mani fested a strong dislike to the English. According to Blind Harry he was out lawed, when a mere youth, for killing the son of the English governor of Dundee, who had grossly insulted him. But the story is not supported by any trustworthy evidence; and Bower, an accurate writer, asserts that the hostility of Wallace to the English arose from his indignation at beholding their oppression of his relatives and countrymen. Tradition has recorded But the departure of Edward from the conquered kingdom soon revealed the fact, that it was the terror of his presence alone which could secure submission to his rule among the subjugated people. The Scot tish nobility indeed, who had much more at heart the preservation of their estates, than the recovery of the national indepen dence, and who in general throughout this calamitous period acted a base and time serving part, were little disposed to attempt the delivery of their country from the English yoke. But a different spirit ani mated the Scottish people at large. They endured with impatience the very sight of the alien governors and troops, who con tinued to exercise the administration and to occupy the principal fortresses of their realm. These English garrisons, moreover, with the usual insolence of conquest, soon proceeded to insult and oppress the neigh bouring inhabitants ; and above all, the rapacious exactions of the treasurer, Cress ingham, were most instrumental in spread ing through the land an universal hatred to the English government. While the exasperated feelings of the people were contemporary of Romulus, sent with his son when he invaded Ireland. It is believed to have served for many years as the coronation stone of the Irish kings. It is said to have been removed to Scotland and deposited at Iona for the coronation of Fergus, the son of Ere, who led the Dalriadic Sets to the shores of Argyleshire. From thence it was conveyed to the abbey of Scone, in 842, by Kenneth II., when the kings of the Scottish race became the sovereigns of the ancient king dom of the Picts. This venerable relic now forms the support of the coronation chair of the British sovtre;gn in Westminster Abbey. A well-known Latin couplet declares, that wherever this stone is placed there the Scots should be supreme. It has been rendered thus: \u2014 t Fordun (vol. iii. p. 979) asserts the knightly rank of Wallace's family, which seeu.s probable from the admission of one of the English chroniclers, who heap the most rancorous abus3 upon his character.

But the incident which finally caused him to take up arms against his country's oppressors arose out of a quarrel between him and some English officers in Lanark, where he was then residing (1297). Over powered by numbers, he took refuge in the Cartland Crags, a rugged and rocky glen near that town; but Hazelrigg, the English sheriff, enraged at the patriot's escape, burned nis house, and put his wife and children to death. Wallace im mediately collected a small band of his the west of Scotland, and soon wrested almost every fortress in that district from the enemy. The fame of those successes attracted the Steward of Scotland, the bishop of Glasgow, Sir Andrew Moray, of Bothwell, and other powerful barons, to the patriotic standard ; and even the younger Bruce, earl of Carrick, who had hitherto adhered to the English interest, was induced to exhibit a leaning towards the popular cause. The tidings of this formidable in surrection alarmed Edward for the security of his newly-acquired dominions, and he promptly sent an army of forty thousand men, under Henry Percy and Robert de Clifford, to crush the insurgents. The story hitherto received was that Wallace was at the head of the Scottish army, and having taken up a strong position in the neigh bourhood of Irvine, prepared to give battle to the enemy ; but that dissensions unfor tunately arose amongst the leaders. The ambition and untractable pride of the barons made them unwilling to submit to the leadership of a man who, however brave and skilful, was their inferior in rank. The con federacy fell to pieces like a rope of sand ; the Steward, Bruce, Douglas, and their friends made their submission (9th July, 1297), while Wallace and Sir Andrew Moray, who alone had resolutely opposed this disgraceful transaction, retired to the north, accompanied by their personal adherents. It has recently been discovered, however, by the activity and research of Sir Francis Palgrave,* that Wallace was not present witb the insurgents who made their submission at Irvine, but was in the north laying his plans for resist ing the invading army at the Forth. Here the patriot was joined by a number of the tenants of the crown and church lands, and even by many of the vassals of the barons who had made their peace with Ed ward ; and while the English commanders remained inactive at Irvine, apparently under the impression that the insurrection was at an end, Wallace captured in rapid succession the castles of Dunnotar, Forfar, Brechin, and friends and avenged the atrocious murder of his wife by the slaughter of Hazelrigg, whose dead body he is said, in the indict ment presented against him on his trial, to have cut to pieces. From this period Wallace devoted himself to the task of redressing his country's wrongs, and hav ing gathered around him a body of fierce and determined men, he carried on against the invaders a kind of guerilla warfare, for which the district around Lanark was admirably fitted. Issuing suddenly from the fastness in which he had taken refuge, he attacked isolated detachments of the enemy, intercepted provisions for their gar risons, stormed a number of their strong holds, and then made a rapid retreat through those wild passes, into which it was most perilous for the English to follow. The fame of his exploits awoke the dor mant spirit of some of the Scottish nobles ; and while Wallace, by a rapid march on Scone, surprised and routed Ormesby, the English justiciary, and obtained a rich booty,* Sir William Douglas, a brave and powerful baron, captured the castles of Durisdeer and Sanquhar, and then uniting their forces, he and Wallace marched to \u2022Hemingford, pp. 118, 119.

Montrose, and the city of Aberdeen. He was engaged in besieging the castle of Dun dee when tidings reached him that a power ful army of the English, under the earl of Surrey, and Cressingham, the treasurer of Scotland, was on its march to Stirling. Wallace immediately hurried to that town in order to guard the passage of the Forth, and took up a strong position on a rising ground near the Abbey Craig, which com manded the bridge of Stirling. The veteran Surrey saw at a glance the danger of defiling his troops along a narrow wooden bridge, with a powerful and vigilant enemy in front ; but yielding to the urgent representations of the rash and presumptuous Cressingham, who insisted that they should not protract the war and waste the king's treasures, the earl gave orders for an immediate attack. The van, under Cressingham and Sir Marmaduke Twenge, crossed the river without opposi tion, and impetuously charged up hill, for the purpose of dislodging the enemy from their strong position; but while the main body of the Scots repelled this attack and drove their assailants headlong before them with their long spears, a portion of the army made a detour to the left, and interposing between the English and the bridge, cut off their retreat. The invaders were thus thrown into inextricable confusion. Many thousands of them were slain or drowned in the river, and the country for miles around was covered with the bodies of the English soldiers. Twenty thousand men, including the treas urer Cressingham, are believed to have fallen in the battle and the flight.* tions, to mitigate the sufferings of the nation, and, besides other measures, resolved to in vade the northern counties of England, both to make reprisals on the enemy, and to feed his famishing countrymen at home with the plunder which he might obtain. He accord ingly crossed the border at the head of a small but resolute force, wasted with fire and sword the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland, which he rendered little better than a wilderness, and led back his forces unmolested to his own country, laden with booty.* Soon after his return from this suc cessful expedition (1297), Wallace, in an assembly of the principal nobility, held at the Forest-kirk, in Selkirkshire, was chosen guardian of the kingdom, in the name of King John, and with consent of the com munity of Scotland. Armed with this authority, he took prompt measures to re vive the foreign trade of the country, entered into communication with the free towns of Hamburg and Lubeck,f set himself vigor ously to rectify the abuses and disorders of the kingdom, caused a muster-roll to be made out containing the names of all who were capable of bearing arms, and made judicious arrangements for disciplining his new levies, so that a sufficient number of recruits might be in readiness to take the field whenever the exigencies of the state required their services. About midsummer of 1297 Wallace at tacked a considerable body of English, under the earl of Pembroke, who had landed in Fife, and defeated them, with the loss of fifteen hundred men. Meanwhile the Eng lish king, who was absent in Flanders, sent urgent injunctions to his barons to assemble their retainers, and to repress and punish the audacious rebellion of the Scots. A con siderable force was accordingly collected by the earl of Surrey, but nothing was done with it until the return of Edward from the Continent. In the summer of 1298 the Eng lish monarch in person invaded Scotland, This brilliant and decisive victory was followed by the surrender of Dundee and the other chief strongholds in the kingdom. But the miseries of the devoted country continued to increase ; and, in addition to the horrors of war, a grievous famine, followed by a pestilence, cut off great num bers of the people. Wallace, on whom the government of the kingdom had tacitly de volved, sought, by various judicious regula- * Hemingford, pp. 133-135. t Wallace Papers, published by the Maitland Club, where a sac-simile is given of Wallace's letter to these towns. * Hemingford. p. 130.

The efforts of Wallace to resist this formidable invasion were greatly hindered by the mean and selfish jealousy of the Scottish barons, who were envious of his military renown and influence. A few of the nobles, however, such as Comyn of Badenoch, Stewart of Bonkill, Graham of Abercorn, and Mac duff\", the granduncle of the earl of Fife, repaired to the national standard, and con sented to act with the guardian of the kingdom. the neighbouring wood, and afterwards made good his retreat beyond the Forth. Edward followed him as far as Stirling ; but after laying waste the country on all sides with fire and sword, he was compelled, by the scarcity of provisions, to return to his own land, leaving the greater part of Scotland still unsubdued. Wallace now resigned the office of guardian of the kingdom, finding that his measures for its defence were hindered or defeated by the jealous and factious spirit of the great nobles. He did not, however, retire from the contest in disgust, or despair of his country's cause. But seeing no im mediate prospect of doing any good at home, he repaired to France for the purpose of soliciting aid from the French king. On his voyage he was attacked by a famous piratical rover named De Longueville, whom, however, he vanquished and took prisoner, and carrying him to the court of France, succeeded in obtaining his pardon from the king.* On the return of Wallace to his own country, the Red Rover, as De Longueville was called, accompanied his generous victor, and fought by his side in many a bloody contest. The mission of the Scottish patriot was unfortunately timed, as Philip had just concluded a treaty with the English king, and was about to give his sister in marriage to Edward, and his daughter to the prince of Wales. On the arrival of Wallace at Amiens he was thrown into prison, and a letter was written by Philip to Edward, offering to send the obnoxious Scotchman to London. This step seems, however, to have been taken merely to save appearances, for Wallace was secretly released from prison, and furnished with letters (dated November, 1298) to the French agents at the court of Rome, directing them to entreat the pontiff to give the Scottish patriot a favourable hearing. It cannot now be ascertained whether he ever reached the papal court ; but this much is certain, that the pope, Boniface VIII., at this time issued a bull against the pretensions of the English king The plan which Wallace had formed for the defence of the country was marked by great sagacity, and often in subsequent times proved successful against far superior num bers. He resolved to avoid a general encracre ment with the invaders, but to hang upon their line of march, to drive off all the sup plies, waste the country through which they were to advance, and when they should be compelled to retreat by privation and the failure of provisions, to harass them by in cessant attacks. This scheme was for a time attended with complete success. Edward advanced through Berwickshire and Mid lothian to the neighbourhood of Linlithgow, without being able to discover or to obtain any information respecting the invisible foe. His army began to suffer severely from the want of provisions ; an alarming mutiny broke out in his camp, and he was compelled to issue orders for a retreat. At this critical juncture, two treacherous nobles, the earls of Dunbar and Angus, gave secret information to Edward respecting the plans of Wallace, and the position of the Scottish army; and on the following day (22nd July) he attacked them in the neighbourhood of Falkirk, with overwhelming numbers, and after a desper ate conflict, completely defeated them with the loss of fifteen thousand men, among whom were Sir John Graham, Sir John Stewart, and Macduff, granduncle to the earl of Fife.* Wallace, with the remnant of his army, succeeded in gaining the shelter of * Hemingford, vol 1. pp. 102-105.

He managed his steed won derfully well, and bore, with a blue label, the arms of the good king his father.\"* Meanwhile the Scottish guardians had laid siege to the castle of Stirling, the most important stronghold in Scotland, which still remained in the hands of the English. Aware of its vast importance, the English monarch assembled a powerful army at Berwick, and prepared to march to the relief of the beleaguered fortress. But his barons, irritated at his violation of his pro mise to confirm certain charters, positively refused to cross the border, alleging that the severity of the winter, the impassable nature of the country, and the scarcity of provisions and forage, rendered an expedition into Scot land at that season wholly impracticable. Edward, in high dudgeon, was obliged to leave Stirling to its fate; and the garrison, finding relief hopeless, soon after surrendered. This formidable and splendid army marched into Annandale, took Lochmaben, the fortress of Robert Bruce, and then besieged and, after a resolute defence, cap tured the strong fortress of Caerlaverock on the Solway Frith. Edward then marched into Galloway, took several castles, and plundered and laid waste the country. At Irvine he encountered the Scottish army under the regents. But after a brief skirmish they retreated to the fastnesses of their mountains, whither the English men at-arms found it impossible to follow them. Another division of the English army laid waste Clydesdale and committed the most revolting cruelties upon the inhabitants. The approach of winter, however, compelled Edward to delay further operations till another season ; and he therefore concluded a treaty with the Scots (30th October), which was to last till Whitsunday in the following year (1301). While the English monarch was en camped near Caerlaverock, he received a bull from Pope Boniface VIII., asserting that Scotland of right belonged to the Holy See, and commanding him to desist In the summer of the following year(1300) Edward renewed his invasion of Scotland, but this time by the western marches. \" On the day appointed\" (1st July), says Walter of Exeter, a Franciscan friar, who accom panied the expedition, \" the whole host was ready, and the good king, with his house hold, then set forward against the Scots, not in coats and surcoats, but on powerful and costly chargers, and, that they might not be taken by surprise, well and securely armed. There were many rich caparisons embroidered on silks and satins, many a beautiful pennon fixed to a lance, and many a banner displayed. And afar off was the noise heard of the neighing of horses ; mountains and valleys were everywhere covered with sumpter horses and wan-o-ons, with provisions and sacks of tents and pavilions. And the days were long and sine. They proceeded by easy journeys, arranged in four squadrons.\" The first squadron was led by Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln.

After adducing various cogent arguments in savour of the independence of Scotland, and in refutation of the pre tensions which Edward had advanced to the feudal superiority of that country, the pope proceeds to exhort the king in the name of God to set at liberty all ecclesias tical persons whom he had imprisoned, and to remove all officers whom he had appointed to places of trust in the kingdom, contrary to the wishes of the people. \" But,\" added the pontiff, \" should you have any preten sions to the whole or any part of Scotland, send your proctors to me within six months. I will hear and determine according to jus tice. I take the cause under my peculiar cognizance.\" To these papal admonitions the archbishop of Canterbury, who brought the bull, added his own injunctions on the duty of obedience to the pontiff, warning the king that if he resisted or demurred, Jerusalem would not fail to protect her citizens, and to cherish, like Mount Zion, those who trusted in the Lord. At the close of this singular address, which was made in the presence of the assembled nobles, Edward swore a great oath, and exclaimed in fury, \" I will not be silent or at rest, either for Mount Zion or Jerusalem ; but as long as there is breath in my nostrils, I wdl defend what all the world knows to be my right. \" * But aware of the necessity of carrying his barons with him in this con test with the Romish see, he immediately disbanded his army, and summoned a par liament to assemble at Lincoln in February, 1301. There the papal bull was submitted to the assembled earls and barons of Eng land, who directed a spirited letter to the pope, repudiating the claims of the Romish See to the kingdom of Scotland, affirming that in temporals the kings of England were not amenable to the See of Rome, and declaring that they could not and must not permit their king to follow measures subversive of that government which they had sworn to maintain.! Meanwhile the truce having expired, Edward in the summer of 1301 again marched into Scotland at the head of a powerful army; but an early and severe winter having set in, the campaign was wholly ineffective. Edward passed the winter at Linlithgow, where he had built a castle, and here, on the 26th of January, 1302, he was induced by the mediation of the French king to conclude another treaty with the Scots, which was to continue to the 30th of November. He shortly after wards returned to London. At the expiry of the truce Edward pre pared to renew the war, and sent into Scotland Sir John de Segrave at the head of an army of twenty thousand men, chiefly consisting of cavalry. Segrave marched from the borders towards Edinburgh, and having reached the neighbourhood of Ros lin he imprudently divided his troops into three divisions so far separated that they had no communication with each other. Meanwhile one of the Scottish guardians, John Comyn, having heard of the approach of the English, made a forced march in the night from Biggar to Roslin, at the head of a chosen body of eight thousand men, attacked in succession the three divisions of the enemy, and routed them with great slaughter. Segrave himself, along with his brother and son, and sixteen knights, and one hundred and thirty esquires, fell into the hands of the victorious Scots, along with a rich booty, while Sir Robert Neville and Ralph the Cofferer, the paymaster of the army, were left among the slain. This victory for a brief space once more freed Scotland from its invaders; but it soon became evident that a contest carried on against such overwhelming numbers and resources must ultimately issue in defeat. The country was gradually re duced to a state of complete exhaustion, and it became evident that the most strenu ous efforts of the patriotic leaders could not much longer maintain the independence of the Scottish people. They were now de serted by their faithless allies, Pope Boniface \u2022Walsingham, p. 78. Feed. ii. p. 8/5."], [286, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1303-1304. 248 and the king of France. The former hav ing quarreled with Philip sound it expedient to court the friendship of the English mon arch, and addressed a bull to all the Scottish bishops, commanding them to be at peace with Edward; while the king of France, on Edward's agreeing to give up his ally the earl of Flanders, hastily concluded a treaty of peace with the English monarch from which the Scots were expressly excluded (20th May, 1303). The termination of the war with France thus enabled Edward to turn his undivided power against Scotland, and he once more invaded the country with a force which rendered resistance hopeless. He overran the whole country south of the Highlands, his progress having been marked at every step by fields laid waste, and towns and villages set on fire. The magnificent abbey of the Benedictines of Dunfermline was levelled with the ground; and the surrender of Stirling, the last fortress in the kingdom which had held out against the English arms, after an obstinate defence by its gallant governor Sir William Oliphant, completed the subjugation of Scotland. The hopes of the patriotic leaders were at length extinguished, and the regent Comyn and his associates made their submission (9th February, 1304) on certain stipulated conditions. To other seven patriotic leaders who had distinguished themselves by their obstinate resistance to the pretensions of the English king, terms more or less severe were offered; but from Wallace, who had recently returned from France, an uncon ditional surrender was required, and there can be little doubt that if he had delivered himself up to the tender mercies of Edward, he would have been immediately sent to execution. self with characteristic perseverance to hunt him down. The English governors in Scot- land were enjoined to make a strict search for the hero ; spies and traitors were em- ployed to discover his haunts ; and large rewards were offered for securing his person dead or alive. These measures were at length successful. According to the un- varying testimony of Scottish history and tradition, Sir John Monteith, a renegade Scottish baron, who then held the castle of Dumbarton for the English, was the person by whom Wallace was betrayed into the hands of the English ; and it is certain that for this service he received from the Eng- lish privy council a grant of land of the annual value of \u00a3100. Having discovered the patriot's retreat through the treacherous information of Jack Short, his servant, he seized him under cover of night at Robroy- ston, a place about three miles from Glasgow, conveyed him instantly to Dumbarton castle, and thence with all speed to London. The studied insult and refined cruelty with which he was treated, have stamped the character of Edward with indelible infamy. The very day after his arrival Wallace was brought to Westminster hall, wearing a crown of laurel in mean and cruel mockery, and impeached by Sir Peter Mallorie, the king's chief justice, as a traitor, and charged with having burned the villages and abbeys, stormed the castles, and slain the liege subjects of his master the king. Wallace pleaded not guilty to the charge of treason, and showed unanswerably that as he had never been the subject of the king of Eng- land, he owed him no allegiance, and con- sequently could be no traitor. But the other articles of the accusation he did not deny; he had fought against the subjects of Edward merely because they were the oppressors of his country. Although the justice of this plea was unquestionable, Wallace was, as a matter of course, con- demned to death. A copy of the sentence pronounced upon him has lately been dis- covered among the MSS. in the British Museum, and contains an interesting outline o The patriot hero continued for some time to carry on the struggle single-handed against the power of the English monarch, and found refuge among the moors and marshes of his native country.

It recites that John Baliol having forfeited the kingdom of Scotland, the English king had conquered it, and had publicly received the homage and fealty of its \" prelates, earls, barons, and others;\" that he proclaimed his peace throughout the realm ; that he arranged a system of government for it, \" according to the laws and customs of that land;\" that the foresaid William Wallace, forgetting his fealty and allegiance, had raised an immense body of followers, had attacked the English officers, had slain William de Haselrigg, sheriff of Lanark, whose dead body he afterwards cut in pieces ; that gaining strength and influence he had stormed the English garrisons, caused his writs to run through all Scotland as if he were superior lord of that realm; that he had summoned parliaments; that he had attempted to league himself with the king of France; that he had ravaged Northum berland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland; that he had opposed the king in a pitched battle; and that when defeated he had refused to avail himself of the terms of peace then held out to his acceptance. He was, therefore, condemned to death. On the 23rd of August, 1305, this noble hero, heavily ironed, was dragged at the tails of horses through the streets to the usual place of execution, the Elms in Smithsield, and put to death with the most barbarous and inhuman tortures. He submitted to his atrocious sentence with unflinching courage. On reaching the place of execu tion, he requested that a psalter which had been taken from his person might be re turned. The desire being complied with, he asked a priest to hold it open before him, and continued to gaze on it till con sciousness failed. His head was then struck off, and his body divided into four quarters. The head was afterwards placed on London bridge, and the limbs were exposed at Newcastle, Berwick, Perth, and Stirling. popular spirit which that renowned leader had first awakened, he soon found abundant reason to be convinced of his error. The death of Wallace was probably more ser viceable to the national cause than the greatest of his achievements. Nothing of his influence expired with him, only that jealousy with which the nobles had re garded his elevation and marred the splen dour of his career. His cruel fate had the effect, which is usually produced by such an event, of endearing to the people the memory of a leader who had fallen a sacrifice to their desertion or weakness ; his example survived to sustain the cause in which he had perished; and his very name became the rallying cry and watch word of freedom. Though Edward, there fore, proceeded once more to settle the administration of the thrice subjugated kingdom, with a moderation which in his age and circumstances was, at least, as deserving of praise as it was uncommon, all his forbearance from the abuse of con quest failed to reconcile the people to his government; and the result showed that nothing more was wanting than some new leader who should acquire their confidence, to induce them to throw off a yoke which they detested.* Such a leader they shortly found in Robert Bruce, grandson of the rival of Baliol. If Wallace first roused the spirit of the Scottish people, to Bruce is due the glory of having restored the Scottish monarchy; and by the gratitude of their country the memory of both has been adorned with a kindred glory. Robert Bruce was descended from a Norman family, which came over to England with William the Conqueror, and obtained ex tensive grants of land in Yorkshire. The son of the founder of the family was the companion in arms of David I. of Scot land at the English court; and when the Scottish prince succeeded to the throne of his ancestors, he bestowed the barony If Edward flattered himself that, with the life of the great champion of Scottish independence, he had extinguished the * Matt.

The career of Bruce had hitherto displayed nothing either of lofty principle or of pure patriotism. In 1296 he made a movement to join the few patriotic barons who were in arms for the independence of their country; and three years later, after Wallace had resigned the regency, Bruce and John Comyn, of Badenoch, with Lamberton, bishop of St. Andrews, were elected joint regents of the kingdom. But the attempt to reconcile the rival fac- tions of Bruce and Baliol proved unsuc- cessful, and some time previous to the battle of Roslin, which was fought in 1302, Bruce made his peace with Edward, and throughout the remainder of the struggle he seems to have remained on the whole faithful to the English party, and to have been treated with confidence by Edward. At this period, Bruce, whatever hopes he may have secretly cherished respecting the Scottish throne, could not urge his claims with any hope of success. Scot- land lay completely prostrate under the power of the English monarch, and the patriotic cause seemed utterly ruined. Wallace and his associates were strenuous supporters of the claims of Baliol, and after the submission of that luckless prince, and his resignation of his rights, the hopes of his family and party centred in John Comyn, his nephew, who by the decision of Edward had, in succession, a clear right to the Scottish throne.* The families of Bruce and Comyn were, therefore, with the exception of one brief interval, ranged on opposite sides; and the movements of both, during the earlier period of the war of independence, were regulated rather by a regard to their selfish interests than to of Annandale upon his early friend, Robert de Brus. The eldest son of this second Robert carried on the English line of the family, wdiile his younger son became the founder of the Scottish branch. His great grandson married Isabel, second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion, and their eldest son, Robert, was the competitor with Baliol for the Scottish throne. His son, also named Robert, married in singular and romantic circumstances a young and beau tiful widow, only child of Nigel, earl of Carrick, and Margaret, daughter of Walter, the High Steward of Scotland, and thus added largely to the estates and feudal influence of the family. Robert Bruce, the restorer of Scottish independence, was the eldest child of this marriage. He was born on the 21st of March, 1274 \u2014 the year in which Edward I. of England was crowned. His early years were, in all pro bability, passed at the castle of Turnberry, the residence of his mother. He after wards resided at the English court, and he was trained by Edward himself in the exercises of war and chivalry. It is said, that after the contest for the Scottish crown was decided in favour of Baliol, the elder Bruce and his son refused to do homage to the new monarch, and that the grandson of the unsuccessful com petitor for the throne, then a youth of eighteen, was, in ' consequence, invested with the family estates in Annandale and Ayrshire, and the title of earl of Carrick, and did homage to John Baliol as his lawful sovereign. The truth of this state ment may be doubted ; but the father of King Robert, who was a quiet, unambi tious man, seems, during his lifetime, to have transferred his estate and title of Carrick to his son, though, as this was the inheritance of his wife, it may have gone to her eldest son by the nature of the investiture. The elder Bruce died at bis castle of Lochmaben in 1295; his son survived till 1304, and on his death the vast English estates of the family were * Comyn was the son of John Comyn, lord of Badenoch, one of the competitors for the crown along with Baliol and Bruce.

He boosted, also, of his descent from Donald Bane, a son of \" the gracious Duncan.\" Comyn, the competitor, married a sister of Baliol, and their son, called the Red Comvn, was Bruce's rival.

At the close of the struggle in 1304, Comyn, who had continued his resistance for some time after Brace's submission, fell under the displeasure of the English king, and was punished by a fine, while Bruce stood high in favour with Edward, and was employed by him as a commissioner, along with Wishart, bishop of Glasgow, and Sir John de Mowbray, in framing regulations for the future government of Scotland. which Edward at that time convoked. On being shown the bond which Comyn had transmitted, and asked if he knew the seal, he at once denounced the deed as a forgery, and offered to prove this if allowed sufficient time to send for his real seal. Edward, either staggered by Bruce's cool- ness and air of injured innocence, or desirous to get into his power the other members of his family, acceded to his request, and allowed him to leave the Parliament for the purpose of procuring the materials for his exculpation. But that very night Bruce was warned by his kinsman, the earl of Gloucester, of a design to seize his person, and, accompanied by a single attendant, he fled into Scotland. He was still ignorant of the person who had betrayed him, though his suspicions must have been directed to- wards Comyn; but on his way to the north he met a person whom he recognized as a servant of that baron, and who, on being searched, proved to be the bearer of letters from his master to Edward, urging the immediate imprisonment of his rival. The messenger was immediately slain, and his letters seized. With these documents in his possession, Bruce continued his flight, and after halting for a brief space at Loch- maben, he proceeded to Dumfries, where Comyn, along with the other barons of the district, wras in attendance upon the English justiciaries, who at that time were holding their sittings in the town. The two rivals met in the church of the Grey- friars, 10th February, 1305-6. It is diffi- cult, if not impossible, to obtain satisfactory evidence of what passed on this occasion; but according to the rumour and belief of the day, a warm altercation took place be- tween the two, in the course of which Bruce reproached his associate for his treachery. \" It is a falsehood you utter,\" retorted Comyn; on which Bruce instantly stabbed him with his dagger on the steps of the high altar; and, appalled at his deed, he hur ried out of the sanctuary in a state of the greatest excitement. Two of his followers, named Kirkpatrick and Lindsay, noticing Disappointed in his long-cherished ex- pectations, Bruce at this juncture resolved to adopt other measures for the vindica- tion of his own rights, and the restoration of his country's freedom. He now entered (11th June, 1305) into a secret bond with Wdliam de Lamberton, bishop of St. An- drews, by which they bound themselves to make common cause in resisting the ene- mies of their country. This league was joined by the earl of Strathearn, the bishop of Moray, and various other barons and prelates; and ultimately, it is said, Bruce revealed the conspiracy to his rival Comyn, and sought to secure his services in achiev- ing the independence of Scotland. The Scottish historians affirm that, with the view of adjusting their rival claims and combining their strength, Bruce offered to support the title of Comyn to the crown on receiving as the reward of his aid the extensive estates of that noble ; or, as an alternative, proposed to make over all his possessions to Comyn, on condition that he would bind himself to support Bruce's claim to the throne. To this last alterna- tive Comyn readily assented, and the con- tract was secretly and solemnly ratified, each party retaining a copy of the bond. But Comyn, it is alleged, who hated Bruce, resolved to avail himself of this opportunity to ruin his rival, and transmitted to Edward information respecting the conspiracy, to gether with certain letters which afforded decisive evidence of Bruce's guilt. The earl of Carrick, unsuspicious of danger, was residing at the English court, and without hesitation attended a parliament"], [290, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1306. 252 his agitation, demanded the reason. \" I doubt,\" said Bruce, \"that I have slain the Red Comyn.\" \"Do you doubt?\" said Kirkpatrick, \"I will mak siccar\"* (sure), and, rushing into the church, he despatched the wounded man. His uncle, Sir Robert Comyn, and several of his adherents, shared his fate. This atrocious deed cut off' all hope of reconciliation with the English king, and Bruce felt that he must either assert at once his right to the crown, or sink into the condition of an outlaw and a fugitive, excommunicated by the church, and a price set upon his head. His de cision was speedily taken. Summoning hastily to his assistance the friends and adherents of his family, with a few nobles who were known to be favourable to the cause of Scottish independence, he rode to Scone, and was there solemnly crowned on the 27th of March, 1306. As the regalia of the kingdom had been carried off by Edward, a small circlet of gold, probably borrowed from the brow of some virgin or martyr, was substituted for the royal crown, and the coronation robes were sup plied from his own wardrobe by Wishart, bishop of Glasgow. Two days later, Isa bella, countess of Buchan, and sister of Duncan, earl of Fife, appeared at Scone, and (in absence of her brother, who, with her husband, was in the English interest) claimed the hereditary privilege of her family, who, since the days of Malcolm Canmore, had enjoyed the distinction of placing the Scottish kings on the cele brated Stone of Destiny. Bruce at once complied, and on the 29th of March he was a second time placed upon the throne by the countess, who was afterwards cruelly punished by Edward for her adventurous and patriotic act. measures to avert the dangers which threatened his northern conquests. The earl of Pembroke was appointed guardian of Scotland, and dispatched in all haste to his post; and the pope was induced, by the solicitation of Edward, to pronounce sen tence of excommunication against Bruce and his adherents; but the Scottish ecclesi astics, who were strenuous defenders of their country's rights, paid no respect to the man dates of the pontiff. Pembroke, on reaching Scotland, took possession of the important town of Perth with a powerful army. Bruce, who had in the meantime been visiting dif ferent parts of the country favourable to his interests, appeared before that town; and though his forces were greatly out numbered by those of his adversary, in the chivalrous spirit of the age he challenged the earl to fight him in the open field. Pembroke having answered that he would meet him on the morrow, Bruce drew off his men, in full reliance on this solemn promise, which, according to the usages of chivalry, it was held dishonourable to violate, and encamped in the wood of Methven, about six miles distant from Perth. Pembroke, however, led out his troops that same evening (18th June), and fell upon the Scots, who were completely taken at unawares, one-third of them having been sent out in search of forage. After a desperate resistance they were ultimately routed with great slaughter, and Bruce, who was thrice unhorsed in the action, with con siderable difficulty effected his escape into the wilds of Athole with the small remnant of his force, amounting to about five hun dred men. Driven from Athole by the want of provisions, he descended into the low country of Aberdeenshire, where he was joined by his queen and other ladies, deter mined to share in the dangers and privations of their husbands and fathers. On the ap proach of a superior force of the enemy, this small band of fugitives withdrew to the mountains of Brcadalbane, where they sub sisted for some time on wild berries and the produce of fishing and the chase. Retreat- When the news of this insurrection reached the English king, in spite of his age and infirmities, he took immediate * The crest of the Kirkpati icks, in allusion to this event, is a hand holding a bloody dagger, with the motto, \" I mak siccar.\" See Sir Walter Scott's \" Lord of the Isles,\" canto ii. and notes.

On receiv ing intelligence of the approach of Bruce and his adherents, this powerful chieftain col lected his vassals and attacked the little band of fugitives in a narrow defile at Dairy, near Tyndram, in Strathfillan, and after a severe engagement, in which Bruce performed pro digies of valour, compelled them to retreat. This repulse greatly aggravated the difficulty under which the patriots already laboured. The approach of winter rendered it impos sible for the ladies any longer to subsist amid those barren wilds, and they were accord ingly sent to the castle of Kildrummie in Aberdeenshire, under the escort of the earl of Athol, and of Nigel Bruce, the king's brother. Bruce himself and a few of his adherents, after encountering great difficulties and dan gers, found means to pass over to the small island of Rachrin, on the northern coast of Ireland, where he lurked in concealment during the winter of 1306. his brother John at Newcastle. The earl of Athol and the brave Sir Simon Fraser, the last friend and companion of Wallace, were executed at London, with circum stances of shocking barbarity, as were also many other barons and knights. The bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, and the abbot of Scone, were put in irons and conveyed to prison in England. A formal sentence of excommunication was at this time pronounced by the papal legate against the Scottish king and his adherents, and their estates were confiscated and bestowed on different English nobles. On the approach of spring Bruce quitted his retreat in Rachrin, and passed over to the isle of Arran. He now meditated an attempt to wrest his ancestral domains in Carrick from the hands of the English, and accordingly effected a landing on the head land beneath Turnberry castle, which was occupied by a strong garrison, commanded by Lord Percy. Under cover of night, he at tacked the English troops quartered in care less security in the hamlet of Turnberry, and put most of them to the sword. A rich booty fell into the hands of the assail ants, who, after this exploit, withdrew to the mountainous parts of the surrounding country. Percy soon after evacuated Turn berry castle, and retreated into England. This success was counterbalanced by a grievous disaster which at this juncture befell two of Bruce's brothers, Thomas and Alexander, who had been despatched to Ire land for the purpose of collecting reinforce ments in that country. On their return, having landed at Loch Ryan in Galloway with a force of seven hundred men, they were attacked and routed by M'Dowall, a powerful chief of that country, who was in the English interest. The two brothers, along with Sir Reginald Crauford, who were all severely wounded, were taken prisoners, and carried to the English king at Carlisle. With his habitual inhumanity, he ordered them to be instantly executed. For some time after this disaster Bruce was in a very critical situation, and on several In the meantime ruin fell upon the greater part of his friends and adherents. His queen and daughter were forcibly taken from the sanctuary of St. Duthac at Tain, and com mitted to close confinement in England. The heroic countess of Buchan, who had placed the king upon the coronation chair, was immured in a cage in one of the outer turrets of the castle of Berwick, exposed to the passers-by, and forbidden to converse with any person except the women who brought her food. One of Bruce's sisters was confined in a similar cage in Roxburgh castle, the other was shut up in a convent, \u2014 proceedings sufficient of themselves to stamp the memory of Edward with indeli ble disgrace. Nigel Bruce, a beautiful and accomplished youth, after a gallant defence, was compelled to surrender the castle of Kildrummie, and being sent in irons to Berwick, was there executed as a traitor.

His enemies hunted him like a beast of prey, and even had the baseness to lay plots for his assassination. From these perils, however, he succeeded in extricat ing himself by his indomitable courage and his skill in the use of his weapons ; and gaining ground step by step, he at length succeeded in expelling the English from the whole of Ayrshire. In the beginning of May, 1307, his old antagonist, the earl of Pembroke, advanced into this district with a body of three thousand cavalry, and challenged the king to give him battle. Bruce, though at the head of only six hun dred spearmen, agreed to meet him at Loudon Hill; and owing to his admirable disposi tions, the English were completely defeated. This conflict, which was a kind of miniature of Bannockburn, may be regarded as the turning point of Bruce's fortune; for his career from this time to his great crowning victory in 1314 presented an almost unbroken series of successes. enjoined his son to prosecute the subjuga tion of Scotland ; and as if he imagined that there was power in his very mortal remains to quell the revolt of the people whom he had so long oppressed, he repeated a sin gular command, which he had first given previous to his departure from his capital, that his bones should be carried at the head of the invading army, and never be com mitted to the grave till Scotland should be completely subdued. In the words of Froissart, who in all probability received his information from those who witnessed the deathbed of the English monarch, \" When King Edward saw that he should die he called before him his eldest son, who was king after him, and there, before all the barons, he caused him to swear that as soon as he were dead he should take his body and boil it in a cauldron till the flesh departed clean from the bones, and then to bury the flesh and keep still the bones; and that as often as the Scots should rebel against him, he should assemble the people against them and carry with him the bones of his father; for he believed verily that if he had his bones with them, the Scots should never obtain any victory against them \" The English monarch was greatly in censed at the reverses which his troops had met with, and though worn out with age and disease, he resolved to march against the Scots and to inflict signal pun ishment upon them for their insubordina tion. He had been detained at Carlisle during the winter by a wasting illness ; and now, under the excitement caused by Bruce's successes, he put himself at the head of his army, and proceeded towards Scotland, though he was so weak that he required to be supported in the saddle. But in four days he advanced only six miles, and on the 7th of July he expired, in the sixty ninth year of his age, at the small village of Burgh-upon-Sands in Cumberland, within sight of that country which, in spite of all his efforts to add it to his domains, was now on the eve of achieving its independence. His last thoughts were filled with the design which had occupied and embittered twenty years of his reign. On his deathbed he His successor, however, disregarded the dying injunctions of his father, and carried his body to London. It was interred in Westminster abbey, where his tomb is still to be seen, bearing the appropriate inscrip tion, \" Here lies Edward the First, the Hammer of the Scottish Nation.\" Edward I. was twice married. His first wife, Eleanor, daughter of Ferdinand III., king of Castile and Leon, bore him four sons and nine daughters. He had six sons by his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Philip king of France. Edward has not without reason been termed the English Justinian. He was undoubtedly an able and accomplished sovereign, and was pos sessed of a sound judgment, decision, energy, and great military talents. But he was irascible and vindictive and unprin cipled. His ambition too was insatiable, and his treatment of the Welsh prince"], [293, "a.d. 1307.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 255 David and his chieftains, his unjustifiable crusade against the liberties and independ ence of Scotland, and the shocking cruelties which he inflicted upon Wallace and his fellow patriots, have left a blot upon his memory, which no special pleading, sounded on reasons of state, can efface. about four years after the Conquest, when William caused twelve persons skilled in the customs of the nation, to be chosen from each county, who were sworn to in form him rightly of their laws; which, when properly ascertained, were to be rati fied by the consent of the great council. This, according to Sir Matthew Hale, was as sufficient and effectual a Parliament as was ever held in England. But there is not the slightest evidence that these twelve deputies were invested with any authority higher than that of declaring the ancient usages of the districts from which they were sent.* The reign of Edward I. is memorable, as well for the great transactions which he directed abroad, as for the changes which he sanctioned in the constitution of Par- liament, and in the management of public business. The seeds of the popular govern- ment, for which this country has been long distinguished, were sown so irregularly and with so little design, that it has become extremely difficult to determine the precise period at which they sprang up and assumed their present form. The obscurity incident to this inquiry, too, is not a little increased by the undefined limits between a Parlia- ment, properly so called, and those other councils which the sovereign was wont to assemble when he wanted to receive special aid or advice from his subjects. It is, moreover, not easy to ascertain exactly the duties and powers with which the first representatives of the people were invested ; whether, for example, they had originally any share in legislation, or whether their functions were entirely limited to the con- sideration of affairs, so far as these appeared to involve the hazard of war, and of the ways and means for supporting a suitable army. In short, the origin of the Commons, regarded as the third estate of the realm, is involved in such a degree of darkness as not to have been fully brought to light by the learning of our ablest lawyers, anti- quaries, and historians. Selden, Madox, Prynne, Coke, Blackstone, Brady, Miller, and Hallam, have expended the utmost diligence on this point, but without bring- ing their labours to that satisfactory result which it would be extremely desirous to attain on a question of so much im portance. In the fifteenth year of King John an example occurs which has likewise been regarded as an instance of representation. His Majesty instructs the sheriffs to sum mon certain knights and barons to assemble at Oxford on a particular day; adding, \" Send up four discreet knights from your county to hold a conference with us re specting the affairs of the kingdom,\" But it has been well observed, that it remains extremely doubtful whether these four knights were to be elected by the county, or returned in the nature of a jury, at the discretion of the sheriffs The next reign presents examples much less ambiguous, and which may be con fidently regarded as the basis of a county representation. In the thirty-eighth year of Henry III. a writ was issued which, after reciting that the earls, barons, and other great men (c\u0153teri magnates) were to meet at London three weeks after Easter, with horses and arms, for the purpose of sailing into Gascony, requires the sheriff to compel all within his jurisdiction who held twenty pounds a year of the king in chief, or of those in ward of the king, to appear at the same time and place; and that besides those mentioned, he shall cause to come before the king's council at West minster two good and discreet knights of his county, whom the men of his county The first instance of actual representation which occurs in English history, took place \u2022 History of the Common Law, vol. i. p. 202. f I'rynne, Second Register, p. 1 0."], [294, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 'a.d. 1307. 256 on a permanent foundation. It is true that in the Great Charter granted by the prince now named, he promises to summon all archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons personally; and all other tenants in chief under the crown, by the sheriffs and bailiffs, to meet at a certain place within forty days' notice, to assess aids and scutages when necessary. But assuredly it was not till the reign of his son that the Commons of England were duly represented in Parliament, and regu larly put in possession of those important rights which, with various interruptions and many practical improvements, have been transmitted to their posterity.* shall have chosen for this purpose, in the stead of all and each of them, to consider, along with the knights of other counties, what aid they will grant the king in such an emergence. In this case, the object as well as the mode of election give a strong air of resemblance to a modern Parliament. The intention of the monarch was to obtain money from the Commons, through their deputies, who were thus summoned to ap pear in the royal council ; and although the purpose was unquestionably very limited, it paved the way for the attainment of popular privileges, which are always found to accom pany, at no great distance, the concession of pecuniary grants.* But the natural progress of events was somewhat accelerated by the enterprise of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, who, while Henry III. was under restraint, issued writs in his name to all the sheriffs of the kingdom, directing them to return two knights for the body of their county, with two citizens or burgesses for every city and borough contained in it. It is, therefore, in this year (1265) that the representation of the Commons becomes indisputably manifest ; being placed upon more distinct and intelligible grounds than could be derived from those ambiguous cases which have been already enumerated. Some obscurity, indeed, continues to hang over the privilege of franchise, as no record remains which would enable us to deter mine the extent to which the right of election was enjoyed by the owners of land. If it was still confined to those who held their estates on the tenure of military service, the constituents of the first parliamentary knights could not be numerous. It admits not of reasonable doubt, however, that the rude outline of a House of Commons was sketched in the forty-ninth year of the third Henry. The victory gained by the barons over the obstinate tyranny of King John, however valuable it might be in other respects, did not secure the liberty of the people at laro-e The usages and authority on which the rights of the people to a parliamentary representation were ultimately established, appear in a more distinct form during the reign of Edward I. There is not, indeed, sufficient evidence on record to prove that the communities of towns and boroughs were regularly summoned, during the in terval between the usurpation of Montfort and the twenty-third year of Edward, when the principle of representation was clearly recognized. But there is good reason to believe that the practice was never long discontinued. As often as the king found his finances straitened, he failed not to appeal to the freemen of the chief towns, where trade and even manufactures had already begun to flourish under his pro tection, and to solicit the aid which the exigencies of state might seem to require. It is accordingly worthy of notice that, on one occasion, writs were issued to no other than such wealthy places as could afford to contribute liberally to the royal necessities. t The year 1295 holds a conspicuous rank in the annals of England, as the epoch at which the constitution of Parliament was regularly completed. Edward, who per ceived that the wonted sources of his * Brady, History of England, vol. i., Appendix, p. 227.

It is, says his Majesty in the preamble to his writs, \" a most equitable rule that what concerns all should be approved of by all, and that common dangers should be re pelled by united efforts \" \u2014 a just and en lightened sentiment.* pecuniary supplies which they were called upon to advance.* The state of things which gave permanency to this new branch of the legislature, in the reign of Edward I., had been gradually maturing through several generations. The great fiefs of the crown were successively divided into smaller portions, as the original families increased their lines of descent; and during this process it became a study with the subordinate tenants to lessen, by all the devices in their power, the extent of servi tude due to the sovereign. It was no unusual expedient for persons who held of the king by military tenure, to transfer their lands to the church, and to receive them back under another tenure, by which they were not bound to perform any service. But at this period the office of a member of Parliament was so far from being held an honour or privilege, that it was thought necessary to demand from the deputies a certain security for their attendance upon the king, wherever he should summon the great barons and other tenants in chief. The boroughs, in return, bound themselves to defray the expense of their representa tives ; a circumstance which, while it made them place less value on the distinction bestowed by the royal favour, rendered them more insensible to the affront of being over looked when the sheriffs neglected to order an election. At first the burgesses, as being commonly men of inferior station, were hardly considered as an essential part of the national council. They were not allowed to \"mix with the noblemen or knights ; and after they had given their consent to the taxes with which their communities were to be charged, their duties were considered as fulfilled, though much of the public business might still remain to be discussed. In course of time, however, the mercantile class became aware of their own importance, and began to measure their claims on the government by the amount of their payments into the exchequer. They learned to couple petitions with their grants, and to make the redress of grievances a condition of the Hence the royal prerogative was constantly diminished, and more especially in that most essential of its functions, which respects the levying of soldiers for the public defence or foreign conquest. The numerous expe ditions of Edward, both into France and Scotland, had greatly exhausted the martial spirit of his subjects, and made it necessary to enlist men, wherever they could be found, who were willing to carry arms as mercen aries. But troops could not be raised without the command of money; and although in those days very arbitrary measures were occasionally used for recruiting the royal finances, the provisions of the Great Charter opposed a barrier to the authority of the king over the wealth of his people. In the year 1294, when Edward was engaged in war with his subjects in Poictou, as well as with the insurgents in Wales, he felt himself urged by his wants to exact not less than a sixth of all moveables from the laity, and a half of all the ecclesiastical benefices. As such a method of taxation could not fail to excite complaints, he adopted the resolution already mentioned, and conferred a legis lative rank upon the burgesses of the prin cipal towns, to which he looked for a more regular supply. In his reign the knights \u2022 Cotton, Abridgment, with Prynne's Preface : Brady on Boroughs, p. 52. * Brady, pp. 25-33. Madox, Firma Burgi, p. 21. 33"], [296, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1307. 258 for shires, or, in other words, between the knights and burgesses. of shires amounted to seventy-four, while the citizens and burgesses were about two hundred and sixty-three.* It is not easy to fix the precise epoch when the Parliament was divided into two houses, because there is no small degree of ambiguity in the terms in which the ques tion at issue is expressed. There is no doubt that the Peers and Commoners met in the same hall, long after the latter were permanently engrafted on the legislature; though it is equally manifest that the pro ceedings of each body were in some measure independent of the other, as to the main subject for which they were assembled. For example, in the celebrated Parliament which was convened in the twenty-third year of Edward I., the earls, barons, and knights gave the king an eleventh ; the clergy gave a tenth; while the citizens and burgesses gave a seventh. Similar resolu tions may be found in the records of later parliaments; and there are even some indi cations that the Lords and Commons met at the same time in different places. These last, however, had no speaker till the time of Edward III.* The feudal system, however wisely admin istered, naturally created jealousy between the monarch and the greater barons who held of his crown. Occupying the relation of servants and vassals, the nobles were compelled to acknowledge a subjection, the duties resulting from which they were not at all times willing to perform; and hence arose the numerous disputes between the head of the government and those upon whom his principal reliance was necessarily placed. The history of all feudal states presents an incessant struggle between the sovereign and the more powerful of his tenants ; an evil which was not remedied untd the Commons had acquired so much influence as to threaten the independence of both. But before this change could be accomplished, it had become the policy of the king to strengthen the interests of the minor barons and the representatives of towns, and even to court their friendship, as a counterpoise against the ascendancy of the peers, who could more readily unite against him. It appears, accordingly, that ever after the successful resistance made to John and Henry III., the knights of shires and burgesses were more regularly summoned to take their seats in Parliament. The latter of these two bodies constituted originally the Commons of England ; for the knights, as they held of the crown in chief, belonged, in fact, to the class of nobles, and were accordingly permitted to sit and delib erate as barons of the kingdom. After the lapse of a certain period, when the import ance of the boroughs had attracted greater weight and respectability, the office of representing them was not declined by gentlemen of landed property in the several counties \u2014 an arrangement which soon re moved all ground of distinction between the deputies of towns and the members Some ages passed away before the princi ples of legislation were clearly defined, and the reciprocal check on the three estates was finally established. At first the petitions of the people, presented through their represent atives, were submitted to the king person ally, who considered himself invested with sufficient power to remove the grievance, or bestow the favour for which his clemency was solicited. Thus many laws originated in the royal assent to popular claims, the full tendency of which was not at once perceived. Nor was it until their operation was felt as prejudicial to the interests or inconsistent with the rights of the other orders, that the barons interfered, and insisted that no public ordinance should be passed without their knowledge and consent. The reign of Henry V. had arrived before the Commons attained to such refinement in legislation as to desire that laws should not be founded directly on their petitions, but * Heming., vol. i. p. 52.

Edwaed II., the eldest son of the deceased monarch, peacefully ascended the vacant throne. On his deathbed the stern old king had implored his son to avoid the company of worthless parasites, and had especially forbidden him to recall Piers Gaveston, a handsome Gascon, his chief favourite, whom Edward had expelled from England. But the foolish youth immediately recalled Gaves- ton from the Continent, created him Earl of Cornwall, loaded him with other honours and immense estates, made him lord cham- berlain, and conferred upon him the hand of his own niece, Margaret de Clare. To save appearances, he was obliged to make a semblance of prosecuting the war with Scotland ; he marched as far north as Cumnock, on the borders of Ayrshire, and remained there from the 6th to the 28th of August. He then retraced his steps, and returned to England without having performed a single act of im portance. He had appointed the earl of Pembroke guardian of Scotland ; but on reaching York, with his characteristic fickleness he removed Pembroke from the office, and bestowed it on the earl of Rich mond. Meanwhile, before leaving Scot land, he had already been joined by Gaveston, through whose influence the principal officers appointed by the late king were at once deprived of their places, and some of them were even stripped of their property and thrown into prison. In a word, the complete control of the affairs of the kingdom was openly vested in the hands of this weak and worthless minion. The nobles, who were not less offended at the ostentatious parade of this upstart than disgusted by his profusion and rapacity, were inflamed against him with the deep est resentment, and resolved to embrace the first opportunity of hurling him down * History of the Exchequer, p. 36."], [298, "[a.d. 1308 260 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. disturbed by one of the usual insurrections of the native chiefs.* from the eminence which he had so un deservedly attained. In January, 1308, Edward sailed for France to marry the Princess Isabella, daughter of Philip le Bel, reputed the most beautiful woman of her time, to whom he had long been contracted. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp in \"our Lady church of Boulogne\" on the 25th of January. No fewer than four kings and three queens were present at the ceremony. Edward manifested the greatest impatience to return to England, and cut short the usual festivities in his eagerness to enjoy once more the company of his favourite, whom he had appointed regent of the kingdom during his absence. Both on his arrival and at the coronation (24th February), his partiality for Gaveston was exhibited in a way that gave deep offence, not only to the nobility, but to the queen. Headed by the earl of Lancaster, the first prince of the blood, who possessed a degree of power only inferior to that of the king himself, the barons entered into a confederacy against the odious minion, whose own imprudence and ostentation had greatly increased his unpopularity; and four days after the coronation they petitioned the king that he would immediately banish Gaveston from the kingdom. Edward pro mised to give them an answer when the Parliament should meet, after Easter, and, in the meantime, strove by every means in his power to disarm the resentment of the nobles. Their indignation was too deep, however, to be appeased in this way; and when the Parliament assembled at Westminster the feeble monarch was com pelled to submit to the terms dictated by the confederates, and to banish his favour ite. Gaveston himself took an oath that he would never return to England under the penalty of excommunication. The king accompanied him to Bristol, the place of his embarkation; but after the lapse of a few weeks it was discovered that he had been sent to assume the mili tary government of Ireland, at that time The resolution of the king was as in firm as his judgment was weak, and his moral character degraded. He had yielded reluctantly to the menaces of the con federate barons, and be conceived that any method by which he could escape from the obligation under which he had reluctantly come, was perfectly consistent with truth and honour. He therefore laboured to gain over by preferment and by flattery the more powerful of the hostile nobles, while he obtained from the pope, in favour of Gaveston, a formal dispensa tion from the oath he had taken not to return to England. After the lapse of only thirteen months the favourite was accordingly recalled from Ireland, once more received with open arms, loaded with additional honours, and enabled to resume that expensive and ostentatious manner of life which had justly excited the indigna tion both of the court and of the peoples The infatuated monarch and his foolish favourite were equally incapable of learning from experience, and both continued their former course, apparently without misgiv ings or apprehension. The court was filled with parasites and buffoons, and other per sons of the lowest character; and feasting and revelry were the habitual occupations of the king and his degraded associates. The arrogance and presumption of Gaveston became every day more intolerable ; he took pleasure in treating the nobles with studied insolence and contempt, made them the object of rude witticisms and sarcasms, and gave contemptuous nicknames to some of the greatest barons of the kingdom. The carl of Lancaster he called \"the old hog;\" the earl of Pembroke, \"Joseph the Jew;\" the earl of Gloucester, \"the cuckold's bird;\" and the earl of Warwick, \"the black dog of Ardenne.\" This wretched wit was laughed at by the foolish monarch, but it excited * Knyghton, ut supra, neming. vol. i. p. 248.

It was not until the favourite withdrew from the court, and the summons was repeated, that they agreed to meet at Westminster (March, 1310). Assembling in arms they showed their determination to divest their incompetent sovereign of a large portion of his authority, and wrung from him his consent to the immediate appoint- ment of a committee of peers, who should have power to reform not only the state, but also the royal household, and whose ordi- nances should have all the force of laws. The committee, called \"ordainers,\" was appointed by the primate, and consisted of seven bishops, eight earls, and thirteen barons. It is acknowledged that the commissioners did not abuse the privileges thus unconsti- tutionally conferred upon them ; nor, except in expelling evd counsellors from his pres- ence, do they appear to have given much offence to the king. But he seems to have felt uncomfortable under their restraint, and hastened to the north to take the field in person against the Scots. Here he was joined by Gaveston, in whose society he passed the winter and the following summer, at Berwick and the country along the Scot- tish borders. their commissions. A great number of the strongest fortresses in Scotland were one by one wrested from the English; and it was evident that the whole country would soon be rescued from their grasp. When Edward took the field in person, Perth was threat ened by a Scottish army, and to save that important stronghold from falling into their hands a fleet was ordered to sail to the Tay, and the whole military array of the kingdom was commanded to meet the king at Berwick. In spite of the defection of many of the great barons, and the disgust excited by the conduct of the king and Gaveston, a powerful army assembled at the place of rendezvous, and entered Scotland about the end of autumn; but after advanc ing as far as Renfrew, they were compelled by scarcity of forage and provisions to retrace their steps, and they returned to Berwick without having achieved anything of importance. In the month of August, 1311, Edward was obliged to meet his Parliament at West minster. The barons proceeded at once to carry out the policy recommended by the committee of \" ordainers.\" They rescinded all grants made by the king to his favourite, and ordained that those which might be made hereafter, without the consent of Par liament, should be invalid. They once more ordered that Gaveston should be banished, on pain of death in case of return. They decreed that the king should not leave the country or make war, without the consent of the barons ; that they in Parliament assembled should appoint a guardian or regent during the royal absence; and that all the great officers of the crown, and the governors of the possessions on the Con tinent, should at all times be chosen by the barons, or with their advice and assent in Parliament. They added a new and im portant provision, respecting the meeting of Parliament, to the Great Charter, which the king had once more confirmed in the pre ceding year: \u2014 \"Forasmuch as many people be aggrieved by the king's ministers against right, in respect to which grievances no one The war with Scotland had, of course, languished during the dissensions between Edward and his nobles. While Robert Bruce was steadily freeing his country from the domination of its invaders, the measures of the English government were feeble, fluctuating, and capricious.

The castles of Dumfries, Dundee, Linlithgow, Roxburgh, and Edinburgh, fell one by one into his hands, till at length the only considerable fortress which in Scotland remained in possession of the English was the strong castle of Stirling. can recover without a common Parliament, wTe do ordain that the king shall hold a Par liament once a year, or twice if need be.\" To these ordinances, after a show of resist ance, Edward was compelled to affix his signature; and on the 1st of November fol lowing Gaveston returned to Flanders. But the infatuated monarch, inconstant in every thing except his own foolish favouritism, braved the resentment and power of his nobles, and invited the Gascon knight a third time to leave his retirement on the Continent in less than two months, and to repair to him at York. This, however, wras considered as an insult too great to be borne. The allied peers, headed by the powerful earl of Lancaster, the king's cousin, rushed to arms, and fell suddenly upon the royal party at Newcastle. Edward made his escape by sea along with his minion, but leaving his queen behind him. Gaveston threw him self into Scarborough castle, while the king went to York to collect an army for his relief. The castle was destitute of provi sions, and the favourite was compelled to surrender on the 19th of May, 1312, to the earl of Pembroke (\"Joseph the Jew\"), who, with Lord Henry Percy, pledged his faith that no injury should be done to him. But, with the connivance of his captors he was seized at Edington, near Banbury, by the grim earl of Warwick, \" the black dog of Ardenne,\" who carried him to Warwick, and there in shameful violation of the terms of capitulation cut off his head.* The governor, Sir Philip Mowbray, made a brave defence; but at last, provisions having become scarce, he offered to sur render the fortress if not relieved before the feast of St. John the Baptist (24th June) in the following year. Edward Bruce most imprudently consented to this proposal, all the advantages of which were on the side of the besieged. King Robert expressed the strongest displeasure when the terms of the truce were made known to him. He had every inducement to cancel the engagement ; and Edward had set him the example by compelling the governor of Dundee, only a few months before, to violate an agreement made under precisely similar circumstances. Brace himself, in his earlier days, had by no means been distinguished for scrupulous adherence to his engage ments. But the stern though wholesome discipline of adversity had now purified and strengthened his moral character, and he honourably determined, at all hazards, to abide by the treaty which his brother had made. So far did the chivalrous gene rosity of King Robert extend that he allowed Sir Philip de Mowbray to go in person to London, that he might make known to Ed ward and his council the terms of the truce which he had entered into with the Scots. The king and his barons at once felt that they could not without dishonour abandon Stirling to its fate, and immense preparations were accordingly made for the relief of the beleaguered fortress. The whole military array of the kingdom was summoned to meet at Berwick on the 1 1th of June. Auxiliaries For some months after this tragical event the king and his barons were in arms against each other; but a temporary reconciliation was effected about the end of the year. Edward granted an amnesty to the barons, which was confirmed by an act of Parlia ment; and the plate and jewels of the deceased favourite were surrendered to the king, who, however, resolutely refused to declare Gaveston a traitor. Meanwhile Robert Bruce had succeeded in establishing his authority over the greater * Brady, Appendix, No. 50 ; Walsingham, p. 95 ; Knyghton in X. Scriptores."], [301, "A.D. 1313.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 263 were brought from Ireland, and a powerful fleet was equipped for the transportation of provisions and warlike stores for the use of the army. On the appointed day there assem bled at the place of rendezvous the most magnificent army that England had ever sent forth, amounting in all to upwards of a hun dred thousand men, including fifty thousand archers and forty thousand cavalry. At the head of this formidable army Edward crossed the border and advanced towards Stirling. Steward of Scotland. The king himself com manded the reserve, composed of his own vassals of Carrick, and of the men of Argylc, Cantire, and the Isles. The camp followers were stationed with the baggage behind an eminence in the rear, still called the Gillies', or Servants', Hill. (See Plan.) On the morning of June 23rd the Scottish army heard mass and made their shrift \" full devoutly,\" says Barbour, like men who were resolved to free their country or to die in the field. King Robert then proceeded to arrange his men under their different ban ners, and to assign to them their proper positions ; and their arrangements were scarcely completed when the vast host of the enemy was descried covering the whole country far and wide, and forming a mag nificent spectacle of martial pomp and splen dour. On approaching Stirling the English king detached Sir Robert Clifford with a chosen body of eight hundred horse, direct ing them to make a circuit round the left flank of the Scottish army, and to throw themselves into the beleaguered fortress. But this movement did not escape the eagle eye of Bruce ; and Randolph, whom he had en joined to be vigilant in preventing any such attempt, hastened with five hundred spear men to intercept the succours before they could reach the castle. After a brief but stubborn conflict the English were com pletely routed, and fled in disorder to the main body of the army. King Robert meanwhile had mustered his forces in the Torwood, midway between Stirling and Falkirk. They amounted to little more than thirty thousand, of whom only five hundred were cavalry. But his well-disciplined infantry were armed with long spears, and carefully trained to form in line, or squares, or circles, as the nature of the ground or of the fight might require; and he had the sagacity to perceive, what was satisfactorily proved at Bannockburn, as well as at Waterloo, that such a body was capable of offering an effective resist ance to the charge of the best-equipped cavalry, though greatly superior in numbers. The place which he selected for the field of action was about two miles from Stirling, and was admirably adapted to the number and character of his troops. It was protected on either flank by defences, partly natural, partly artificial, and was so narrow in front as in a great measure to deprive the enemy of their immense superiority in numbers. The Scottish line of battle faced the south east, from which direction the English were approaching. The right wing was protected by the steep and rugged banks of the rivulet called Bannockburn, and by a dangerous morass. The left, which extended to the village of St. Ninians, and was the most vulnerable part of Brace's position, was de fended against the assaults of cavalry by rows of pits about three feet deep, with sharp stakes fixed in them, and covered with brushwood and green sods. The right wing was commanded by Edward Brace, the centre by Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, and tbe left wing by Douglas and the young While this affair was undecided, the English vanguard came within sight of the Scottish army. King Robert was at the moment riding along the front of his line, marshalling the ranks of his host. He was mounted on a small palfrey, but was clad in complete armour, and carried a battle-axe in his hand. He was easily recognized, both by his position and by a golden coronet which he wore on his helmet. Sir Henry de Bohun, \" a wycht knight and a hardy,\" who rode in front of the English vanguard, armed at all points, and mounted on a strong war horse, per ceiving Bruce thus engaged, couched his"], [302, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 264 [a.d. 1313. commanded by Edward Bruce, but was unable to produce any serious impression on the serried ranks of the Scottish spear- men. The centre and left wing of the Scots were soon after led up, so that the battle became general along the whole line. The English cavalry attempted, like the French cuirassiers at Waterloo, by repeated and desperate charges, to break through the phalanx of the Scottish infantry, but were repulsed with great slaughter in every attack. The English archers, however, began to do considerable execution on the close ranks of the spearmen ; but were taken in flank and completely routed by Sir Robert Keith, marshal of Scotland, at the head of five hundred horsemen, whom Bruce had kept in reserve for that purpose. The battle continued to rage with great fury; but King Robert, perceiving that the English were becoming exhausted and dispirited, brought up his reserve, and pressed with redoubled vigour upon the wavering ranks of the enemy. At this critical period the attendants on the Scot- tish camp, whether acting on the impulse of the moment or from previous orders it is impossible to say, suddenly appeared on the Gillies' Hill, in the view of the army; and, having hastily laid hold of such arms as were at hand, and fastened blankets and sheets upon tent poles for banners, presented the appearance of a new army advancing to the assistance of the Scots. The English, dismayed at this unexpected sight, began to give way; and King Robert, seizing the favourable moment, shouted his war-cry, and made a furious assault on the main body of the enemy, by which they were completely broken. This well-timed charge decided the fate of the day. The English fled in all directions, and were pursued with immense slaughter. Thirty thousand were left dead upon the field, among whom were twenty-seven barons, two hundred knights, and seven hundred esquires. Twenty-two barons and baronets, and sixty knights, with an immense quan- tity of spoil, fell into the hands of the lance, and, spurring his charger, rode furi ously against the king, with the evident expectation that he would easily bear him to the earth, and end the war at a single blow. The contest was most unequal, but, to the surprise of the spectators, Bruce calmly awaited the onset. Just as they were about to close, however, he suddenly turned his palfrey to one side, so that De Bohun missed his aim ; and as he passed in his rapid career Bruce, rising in his stirrups, with one blow of his battle-axe dashed helmet and head to pieces, and laid his assailant dead at his feet. The English vanguard, intimi dated by the result of this personal encounter, retreated in confusion, and were pursued for some distance by the Scottish spearmen. After a spirit-stirring address from King Robert to his assembled generals, they re paired to their respective positions, and the troops passed the night in arms on the field. Early next morning (Monday, 24th June), the Scottish army heard mass, which was performed by the abbot of Inchaffray upon an eminence in front of their line. They then took breakfast, and arranged themselves in their appointed divisions. The vanguard of the English, under the command of the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, now drew near. The king him self brought up the main body, consisting of nine divisions, but compressed by the narrowness of the ground into one immense column. At this moment the abbot of Inchaffray, bareheaded and barefooted, walked along the Scottish line, and, hold ing up a crucifix, exhorted the soldiers to fight bravely for their rights and liberties. As he passed, the whole army knelt down, and \"made a short prayer to God to help them in their fight.\" \"See!\" cried Ed ward, \"they are kneeling to ask mercy.\" \" They do,\" replied Sir Ingram de Umfra ville, who rode beside him ; \" but it is from God, not from you. Trust me, yon men will win or die.\" \" Be it so,\" said the king, and immediately commanded the charge to be sounded.

An abortive attempt was made to bring about a peace between the two countries. Commissioners were appointed on both sides, and negotiations were commenced, but were speedily broken off. The English men refused to renounce the claims of feudal superiority over Scotland, while the Scottish commissioners refused to treat unless they were recognized as the repre sentatives of an independent nation. Two other destructive incursions by the Scots into the northern counties of England, followed this unsuccessful attempt to put an end to these protracted and ruinous hostilities between the two kingdoms \u2014 one in the autumn of 1314, and the other in the summer of 1315. Though the English Parliament was sitting during the former, such was the effect of the growing unpopu larity of Edward, and of the fierce factions existing among the nobles, that no resist ance was offered to the invaders or protection afforded to the people, and the Scots were allowed to return home, unmolested, with their plunder. They were unsuccessful, however, in the assaults which they made, on the latter occasion, both on Carlisle and Berwick. Such was the memorable battle of Ban nockburn, which, both in its immediate consequences and its more remote effects, must be regarded as one of the most im portant events in the history of Scotland. It virtuaUy secured at once the freedom and independence of the country. It showed the English monarchs the hopelessness of their iniquitous attempts to reduce it per manently to the condition of a conquered province, and taught the Scottish people never to regard their cause as desperate even in the last extremity. There cannot be a doubt that they were greatly encour aged during their subsequent struggles for civil and religious liberty, by the recollec tion of the victory of Bannockburn, and that the proud position which Scotland now occupies is in no small degree owing to the deliverance achieved by King Robert and his gallant compatriots. Taking advantage of the panic which the defeat at Bannockburn had created among the English, Edward Bruce and Sir James Douglas about the end of summer invaded England by the eastern marches, levying heavy contributions from the in habitants, and laying waste the country as far as Richmond in Yorkshire. They met with no opposition either in their advance or return, and re-entered Scotland laden with booty, and enriched with the large amount of ransom money paid by the wealthy religious houses of the district. \"At this time,\" says Walsingham, \"the English were so bereaved of their wonted intrepidity, that a hundred of that nation The English rule in Ireland had long been hateful to the Irish people, and shortly after the battle of Bannockburn the chief tains of Ulster sent messengers to Robert Bruce, offering to confer the crown of Ireland on his brother Edward. It was evident that if Ireland could be detached from England, and connected as an ally with Scotland, his most formidable enemy would be weakened, and the security of his own kingdom greatly increased. Though the chances of success were doubtful and remote, Robert ultimately complied with the request of the Irish chief tains for aid in expelling their oppressors, and sent his brother with a force of six thousand men to Ireland, in May, 1315. 34"], [304, "266 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1316. On landing near Carrickfergus he was joined by a number of the native chiefs of Ulster, and on their march to that town the allies encountered and put to flight a body of Anglo-Irish troops, consisting of about twenty thousand men. Following up his victory, Edward Bruce took the town of Carrickfergus, but failed to reduce the castle. Various other towns were captured and burnt by the invaders, and the country was wasted with merciless barbarity. About the end of July Richard de Burgh, the powerful earl of Ulster, assembled a numer ous army, and assisted by some of the Con naught chiefs, marched against the Scots. By a skilful man\u0153uvre Bruce succeeded in gaining, unperceived, the flank and rear of his enemies, and inflicted on them a crush ing defeat, near Conyers on the 10th of September. The earl fled to the south of Ireland, and the Irish inhabitants of Con naught and Meath rose on the English settlers, burned their castles, and destroyed their possessions. Strengthened by a rein forcement of troops which at this time arrived from Scotland, Bruce marched through Meath into Kildare, his progress being marked by a devastation which was as ungenerous as it was impolitic. At a place called Arscol he encountered and defeated Lord Edmund Butler, the justiciary of Ireland (26th January, 1316). This victory left Bruce undisputed master of the greater part of Ireland; but a grievous famine, the consequence chiefly of his own destructive ravages, not only destroyed thousands of the native population, but carried off a number of his soldiers, and to escape complete ruin he was compelled to retreat with all haste to Ulster, where provisions might be procured from Scotland by sea. On his march northward he de feated at Kenlis, in Meath, Roger Lord Mortimer, who at the head of a hastily collected army of fifteen thousand men endeavoured to intercept his retreat. On reaching Ulster with his forces greatly reduced by the hardships of war and the ravages of famine, he despatched the earl of Moray to Scotland to procure a second time reinforcements to his troops, while he resumed the siege of the castle of Carrickfergus, which had hitherto baffled all his efforts. The garrison was reduced to great straits by the want of provisions, when Thomas Lord Mandevdle succeeded in reinforcing them; and the morning after his entrance into the fortress, he made a sudden and vigorous sally on the besiegers. They were completely taken by surprise, and would have been destroyed but for the heroic valour of Neil Fleming and a guard of sixty men, who by the sacrifice of their own lives gained time for their countrymen to arm and form in order of battle. In the end Mandevdle was slain by Edward Bruce, and his men either shared his fate or were taken prisoners. Carrickfergus soon after surrendered, and on the 2nd of May Edward Bruce was crowned king of Ireland. In the month of November foUowing the English government, alarmed at the success of the Scots, appointed Roger Mortimer guardian and lieutenant of Ireland, and placed a large force of cavalry and infantry under his command. On the other hand, King Robert, impressed with the importance to the interests of his own kingdom of mantaining his brother's position in Ire- land, conducted in person a large reinforce- ment of soldiers to the seat of war. The Scottish army, which now amounted to twenty thousand men, led by the two brothers, passed through the county of Louth, defeating on their march a powerful force commanded by the earl of Ulster. They then advanced by way of Drogheda on Dublin, which they endeavoured to cap- ture, but were baffled by the determined resistance of the citizens. After a short stay at Cnoc castle, the Scots marched into the county of Kildare, and thence penetrated as far as Limerick, ravaging the country without mercy. Mortimer, the new lieuten ant, endeavoured to intercept them on their return ; but they skilfully evaded the attacks of his numerous but tumultuary forces, and by forced marches reached Ulster in safety."], [305, "A.D. 1318-1319.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 267 Robert Bruce shortly after returned to his own country, but left behind him the flower of his army. king's bishop,\" as he was afterwards called by his countrymen, in consequence of the saying of Robert when he heard of the ex- ploit : \" Sinclair shall be my own bishop.\" On the 28th of March, 1318, the important town of Berwick, the key of the eastern marches, was captured by Douglas and Randolph, with the assistance of one of the burgesses, who had been harshly treated by the governor. Instead of demolishing the castle, as he had hitherto done with all the strongholds wrested from the enemy, Brace strengthened the fortifications, placed a powerful garrison in it, provisioned it for a year, and committed the keeping of both town and castle to his son-in-law, the High Steward. He then followed up these suc- cesses by an invasion of England, penetrat- ing through Northumberland and Durham into Yorkshire, plundering and burning the country, and returning unmolested with an immense booty and a great ntunber of prisoners. After the departure of his brother, Edward Bruce maintained for some time a precarious authority in Ulster. But he at last lost his life in an engagement with John de Ber- minghain at the head of an army of vastly superior numbers, whom he insisted on fighting, in opposition to the earnest advice of his principal officers. The battle was fought at Fagher near Dundalk, 5th October, 1318. Brace was killed by John Maupas, who was himself found lying dead on the body of his enemy. The victors, to their great disgrace, treated the dead body of their gallant adversary with revolting indignity. It was quartered and exposed, in four differ- ent places in Ireland, as a public spectacle, and the head was carried over by the English general as an acceptable present to King Edward \u2014 a marked contrast to the generous conduct of King Robert after the battle of Bannockburn. Edward Bruce was distin- guished for his bravery as a soldier, rather than for his skill as a leader. His indomit- able courage often degenerated into rashness, and he was deficient in the judgment and prudence necessary to constitute a great commander. Edward, unable to protect his subjects by force of arms, induced Pope John XNIL, a man equally servile and venal, to issue a bull, commanding, under pain of excom munication, a cessation of hostilities for two years \" between the king of England and his beloved son, the noble lord Robert Bruce, carrying himself as king of Scot land ; '* and subsequently to publish an other bull of excommunication against Bruce and his adherents, on the ground that they had captured Berwick in violation of the terms of the papal truce. A small remnant of the Scots under John Thomson, the leader of the men of Carrick, succeeded in making good their retreat to Carrickfergus, and thence to their own country. Taking advantage of the absence of the Scottish king from his own dominions, the English made several attempts to renew the war in Scotland, but were defeated with great loss. In the border districts, the earl of Arundel, the warden of the Eng- lish marches ; a Gascon knight named Sir Edmund de Cailou, governor of Berwick ; and Sir Robert Neville \u2014 were successively defeated, and the two latter slain, by Sir James Douglas. Soon after, a party of English troops, which had landed in Fife, were routed with great loss by tho gallant William Sinclair, bishop of Dunkcld, \" the The animosity between the English king and his nobility ran so high at this period, that all his efforts to assemble an army for the protection of the northern provinces of his kingdom proved fruitless. But in 1319, Edward, availing himself of an apparent reconciliation with the Lancastrian party, resolved to make a vigorous effort for the recovery of Berwick. Having assembled a numerous army at Newcastle, and made immense preparations for the siege of this important stronghold, he sat down before * Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. iii. p. 594."], [306, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The first assault was made, both by sea and land, on the morning of the 7 th; but after a long and fierce con test, she besiegers were repulsed at all points by the Scots, under their gallant leader, the High Steward. Six days later a still more desperate attempt was made to carry the town by storm, but with the same result* Meanwhile, Randolph and Douglas crossed the border at the head of a well-appointed force of fifteen thousand men, and made a rapid march to York, in the hope of carry ing off Edward's queen, who was at that time residing there ; but their plan was foiled, when on the eve of success, by the capture of a Scotchman, who revealed it to the English in time to secure the queen's escape. The invaders then ravaged the country as far as Mitton, where, on the 28th of September, they were encountered by a numerous but undisciplined force, largely composed of monks and friars, under the archbishop of York and the bishop of Ely, whom they defeated with great slaughter. When the news of \" the chapter of Mitton,\" as this rout was named by the Scots in the savage pleasantry of the times, reached Ber wick, the northern barons withdrew, with their followers, to defend their own estates, and Edward was in consequence compelled to raise the siege. He marched southward with all speed, hoping to intercept Randolph and Douglas on their return from their destructive expedition ; but they succeeded in eluding him, and got back to Scotland in safety by the western marches. On the 21st of December following, a truce between the two countries was agreed upon for two years, and the commissioners were also authorized to continue their negotiations for the purpose of effecting a permanent peace. The place of Gaveston was accordingly sup plied by a young Englishman named Hugh le Despenser, whose family, descended from the steward of the Conqueror, had been en nobled in a late reign. Like the former favourite, he is said to have been deficient in prudence and moderation, and to have thereby provoked the animosity of the vindictive Lancaster. Recourse was im mediately had to arms, in which the confederated chiefs so far prevailed as to compel the king to banish his friend and the old baron his father, who was accused of no other crime besides that of being parent to a royal minion. In this enter prise a prominent part was acted by the Mortimers, wardens of the Welsh marches, one of whom soon afterwards became cele brated as the paramour of the queen. In deed, her Majesty is suspected to have lent her countenance to the more active of those who disturbed the tranquillity of her hus band's reign, having been alienated from him by his indifference to her personal charms, as well as by his injudicious choice of private counsellors.* But the partisans of Lancaster having carried their insolence and revenge to an inordinate height, soon witnessed a power ful reaction in behalf of the king. At the head of some troops which he had hastily called together, he hurried to the borders of Wales, and inflicted a signal punishment on several of the disaffected leaders, who, unaware of his design, could make no prep arations to oppose him. The rebels in the northern counties immediately recruited their ranks, and showed a determination to dispute the progress of Edward, who an nounced his intention to advance against the Scots. The earl of Lancaster was intrusted with the command of their levies. A battle took place at Boroughbridge, in which the confederates were entirely defeated, Lord Hereford was killed, and the general himself taken prisoner (1322). This last was soon afterwards led to execution, and beheaded We now return to the course of domestic affairs. Destitute of confidence in himself, Edward, it should seem, found it necessary to repoBe on the ability or attachment of others. * Dugdale, Baron, vol. i. p 389. Walsingham, p. 113. Knyghton, in X.

In Lancaster fell the most powerful subject in England ; but as his patriotism was ever subservient to his ambition, he has not escaped the charge of occasionally sacri ficing to selfish views the best interests of his country.* deposition, and perhaps the murder, of his sovereign.* To obviate some feudal difficulties it was proposed that Edward should resign the government of Guienne to his son, now thirteen years of age, and that the prince should perform in the French capital the acknowledgment which his father owed for his foreign dominions. No sooner had Isa bella obtained custody of the heir of the English throne than the treason suggested by Mortimer seemed mature. An active correspondence was begun with the disaf fected party at home, to which it is conjec tured her brother, the new king of France, yielded his consent ; and in a short time the spirit of insurrection was roused, and assumed a bolder aspect than at any other period. Having raised in the Low Countries three or four thousand men, Isabella em barked for the opposite coast, and landed in Suffolk, where she was instantly joined by a large body of malcontents. Edward, after in vain appealing to the loyalty of his people, found that his only recourse was in flight; but being hotly pursued by his enemies, he was taken prisoner in Wales, and afterwards conveyed by the earl of Leicester as a a cap tive to the castle of Kenilworth. Many of his adherents were put to death with circum stances of the greatest atrocity; among whom may be numbered the two Spensers, father and son, who were executed without even the semblance of a legal trial. f The king did not pursue the claims of jus tice beyond the bounds of law, or even of expediency, but he permitted young Des penser to enrich himself from the estates of the attainted nobles, and thereby to aug ment the hatred and envy with which his character was already viewed. Nor did Ed ward in any degree retrieve his reputation by a new attempt to conquer the Scots. He entered their country again with a large army; but possessing none of the talents of a great soldier he failed to make any impres sion upon a people who had already learned to despise him ; and accordingly, after having wasted his resources and lost many of his gallant followers, he withdrew his forces in disgrace from a fruitless contest. The death of the king of France, to whom Edward did homage for his possessions in that country, introduced some perplexity into their relations as liege lord and vassal. To adjust the differences which were thus created Isabella his queen repaired to her native court (1325), where she acted the part of a successful diplomatist; but unfortun ately for her own reputation, as well as for the interests of her husband, she had allowed herself to enter into the views of those who wished to deprive the Spensers of their power and vast domains. Meeting at Paris the leaders of the faction which had been overthrown at Boroughbridge, she listened to their complaints, and even to their plans of revenge. Roger de Mortimer in parti cular revived his undue ascendancy over her principles, and induced her to concur in a scheme which had for its object the Nothing was now wanting to complete the nefarious design of Mortimer and Isa bella but the formal dethronement of their unhappy victim \u2014 an object which was soon accomplished by an obsequious Parliament, intimidated by the fury of the populace. The pretext for this violent measure was a charge of incapacity, founded upon a review of his government at home and abroad. His defeat in Scotland and his losses in France were recited as proofs of his unfitness to sway the sceptre of a warlike people, to whom the fortune of battle had usually been propitious ; but no positive crime was * Rymer, vol. iii p. 958.

The bill which was produced against the king in Parliament by Stratford, bishop of Winchester, charged him with shameful indolence, cowardice, and other similar offences, by which it was alleged \"he had done his best to disgrace and ruin his country.\" The articles were admitted by the assembled prelates, barons, and representatives of the people, as afford ing sufficient grounds for a sentence of deposition. On the 20th of January, 1327, a deputation from the Parliament waited upon the royal prisoner at Kenilworth, to state to him that the people of Eng land were no longer bound by their oath of allegiance to him, and to receive his resignation of the crown. The unfortunate king appeared in the great hall of the castle, wrapped in a common black gown, and for mally renounced the royal dignity. Then Sir William Trussed, as speaker of the whole Parliament, addressed to him the following words: \u2014 \"I, William Trussed, on behalf of the whole people of Eng land, and authorized by the Parliament, do hereby withdraw the fealty and homage sworn to you. I no longer am bound in faith to you, and I deprive you of all royal power and dignity. We claim and hold nothing from you as king; and in all time to come declare you to be a mere private person.\"* As soon as Trussed ceased speak ing Sir Thomas Blount, the steward of the household, stepped forward and broke his white wand or staff of office, and declared that all persons engaged in Edward's ser vice were thereby discharged and freed from their obligations. Four days after, the deposition of the old king and the accession of his son were publicly pro claimed in the capital. Edward III., who was only in his fourteenth year, received the great seal from the chancellor, and re-delivered it to him on the 28th of January, and he was crowned on the next day at Westminster, by the archbishop of Canterbury, in the regular manner. The unfortunate monarch did not long survive his deposition from the throne. He was at first entrusted to the care of the earl of Lancaster, who treated the fallen monarch with mildness and generosity. This did not, however, suit the purposes of the queen and her paramour, Mortimer, and Edward was taken out of the hands of Lancaster and committed to the keeping of Sir John Mal travers, a man of a fierce disposition, who had suffered personal wrongs at the hands of the king and his favourite. Mai travers removed the captive from Kenilworth and carried him to three or four different castles in succession, in the space of a few months. At last he was lodged in Berkley castle, where he was foully murdered about eight months after he had descended to the rank of a private individual. The manner of his death was revolting in the extreme ; that catastrophe having been effected by the introduction into his bowels of a red hot iron rod, through a tin tube. Mortimer, who observed the impression made on the public mind by the odious conduct of the queen, whose intimacy with him set all decency at defiance, dreaded a restoration of the deposed sovereign, and the ruin and disgrace which must have followed it. He therefore instigated two individuals, Ogle and Gournay, whose minds were accessible to the lowest motives, and whose hands did not refuse to perform the foulest deeds, to deliver him from his apprehensions by assassinating the unfortunate Edward of Caernarvon. The reign of Edward II. witnessed the abolition of the order of the Knights Tem plars, who by their arrogance had incurred the hatred both of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. This institution, which took place while Jerusalem was in the hands of the Christians, was meant to secure the pro tection of pilgrims who repaired to the holy city for pious purposes; and as their ser vices proved extremely important, money and lands were bestowed upon them by the faithful, who were desirous that access to the sacred shrines should be ever unat- * Rymer, vol. i. p.

At a later period indolence and luxury corrupted their ranks; and as their presence in Palestine had ceased to be necessary, reports extremely prejudicial to their reputation were univer sally circulated. A feeling against them prevailed in France to such an extent that the pope deemed it expedient to interfere, so far at least as to demand that the knights should be brought to trial, and if found guilty punished according to their deserts. In the year 1308 an order was issued for their apprehension on the same day throughout England and Ireland, and their committal to prison; but though a minute and very protracted investigation followed, it did not appear that the charges in regard to the members resident in the dominions of Edward were well founded. The fraternity, however, was suppressed, and their funds bestowed upon the Knights Hospitallers, who had not given so much cause of offence.* were deeply mortified at the result of their measures ; lamented the stain inflicted on the royal family by the conduct of the queen, who had entirely withdrawn her confi dence from them ; and resolved to precipitate the aspiring paramour from the authority which he had so disgracefully and wickedly attained. At this juncture hostilities were resumed between England and Scotland. The cruel injuries which the Scots had received at the hands of their southern neighbours, made them ready to take advantage of the favour able opportunity afforded by the state of affairs in England, to avenge their wrongs and to assert their independence. They complained that the council of regency, while professing the most pacific intentions, had acted in a most insidious and hostile manner, and had been guilty of repeated instances of bad faith. Bruce resolved, therefore, to take measures to compel the new government to recognize his title to the crown, and the independency of his kingdom. Preparations were made on both sides for the prosecution of the war. King Robert sent a formal defiance to the young English monarch, with an intimation that the truce was at an end. Edward, on his part, summoned the military array of his kingdom to meet him at Newcastle by the 29 th of May, to repel the threatened in vasion. Edward III. \u2014 a.d. 1327-1377. Edward III., who ascended the throne in the fourteenth year of his age, was merely a nominal sovereign, as the real power was in the hands of his mother and Mortimer. A couned was indeed appointed by Parliament, consisting of five prelates and seven noble- men, viz., the archbishops of Canterbury and York, the bishops of Winchester, Wor- cester, and Hereford, the earls of Kent, Norfolk, and Surrey, and the lords Thomas Wake, Henry Percy, Oliver Ingham, and John de Roos. The earl of Lancaster was appointed guardian and protector of the person of the young king. But the am- bitious spirit of the Welsh chieftain was impatient of such control, and he boldly assumed the direction of affairs as the part- ner of Isabella, and with all the state and magnificence of a king. The insurgent barons felt that they had expended their treason in vain, and that they had received a master in the person of an accomplice. The princes of the blood, more especially the earls of Kent, Norfolk, and Lancaster, As Bruce, though only fifty-three years of age, had now become infirm, and was at tacked by an inveterate disease, he entrusted the command of the invading army to Ran dolph and Douglas. It consisted of three thousand men at arms, knights, and squires, well armed and mounted upon good war horses ; and twenty thousand light-armed horsemen, mounted on ponies and hardy little hackneys, which, Froissart says, could subsist upon the coarsest food and support any fatigue. \" These Scottishmen,\" says this picturesque old chronicler, \" are brave and exceeding hardy, through their con stant wearing of arms and experience in war. When they invade England, they \u2022 Knyghton. inter X. Scriptores, vol. ii p. 2531."], [310, "272 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1327. often march twenty, or even twenty-four, miles in a single day and night. All are on horseback, except only the rabble of fol lowers, who are afoot. The knights and squires are well mounted on large coursers, or war-horses ; but the commons and coun try people have only small hackneys or ponies. They use no carriages to attend their army, and consequently carry no pro vision of bread and wine along with them. Such is their sobriety that they content themselves for a long time with flesh, half sodden, without bread, and with water un mixed with wine. They have no occasion for pots or kettles, as they contrive to dress their victuals after a manner peculiar to themselves, knowing that they shall always find abundance of cattle in their enemy's country. When they have slain and skinned the cattle, they make a kind of kettles of the raw hides, with the hair on, which they suspend on four stakes over fires, with the hairy side outmost ; and in these they boil part of the flesh in water, and they roast the remainder by means of wooden spits, hung upon wooden spit-racks, and disposed around the fires. Besides, they make for themselves a species of shoes or brogues of the same raw hides, with the hair still on them. Each person carries, between his saddle and the crupper, a flat plate of iron, and a little bag of oatmeal trussed behind him. When, by eating flesh cooked as before described, and with out salt, they find their stomachs weakened and uncomfortable, they put this plate upon the fire, and, heating it, bake thereon their oatmeal cakes, wherewith to strengthen their stomachs. Faring in this hardy manner, it is not wonderful that the Scots should be able to make longer marches than any other troops, being altogether un incumbered with baggage and provisions.\" The army which the English government assembled to repel this invasion, consisted of sixty-two thousand men, of whom eight thousand were knights and squires, fifteen thousand light armed horsemen, fifteen thousand infantry, and twenty-four thousand archers . But their movements were retarde d by a furious quarrel which broke out at York between the English archers and the foreign auxiliaries in the army, and which was not suppressed without considerable bloodshed. Before the army could be put in motion, information was received that the Scots had broken into England by the western border, and were laying waste the country with fire and sword. The troops lost no time in hurrying northward, but could learn no tidings of the enemy until they reached Northumberland, where they perceived the proofs of their presence in the smoke and flames of the villages and hamlets which they had burned. Though they marched from morning \" even till the vesper hour,\" the English were unable to obtain even a glimpse of their nimble-footed foes, who, it afterwards appeared, had withdrawn towards the west among \" the savage deserts and bad mountains and valleys,\" as Froissart calls them, of Westmoreland and Cumberland. After a fruitless and fatiguing pursuit of three days, it was determined in a council of war that the English army should march northwards in a straight line ; and, crossing the Tyne, occupy the fords of that river, in the hope of intercepting the Scots on their return home to their own country. They accordingly hastened northwards with all speed, and crossed the Tyne at a place called Haidon, near Hexham. Here they remained for eight days, suffering great hardships and privations from the inclem ency of the weather, the total want of shelter, and the scarcity of provisions and forage. At last, seeing no appearance of the Scots, and symptoms of mutiny having been exhibited by the soldiers, they re crossed the river, and set out again in search of their adversaries. Public proclamation was now made by Edward that the honour of knighthood and a grant of land, of a hundred pounds yearly rental, should be given to the person who would bring certain information of the place where the enemy could be found. The reward was gained by Thomas de Rokeby, who had fallen into the"], [311, "a.d. 1337.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 273 hands of the Scots, and had been dismissed by them with orders to inform his country- men where they were encamped, as they professed to be equally ignorant of the position of the English army. Edward immediately confessed, ordered mass to be performed, and then, marching towards the Scottish camp, found the invaders strongly posted at the foot of a steep hill, on the right bank of the Wear. As the position seemed impregnable, Edward sent a challenge to the Scottish leaders to meet him on a fair and open field. But Randolph and Douglas were not so foolish as to be influenced by this bravado. According to Froissart, they replied : \u2014 \" The kings and barons of England know that we are in their kingdom, which we have burned and ravaged everywhere on our march. If dis- pleased therewith, let them come and chas- tise us if they choose, for here we mean to remain as long as we please.\" For three days and nights the two armies continued facing each other, the English lying on the bare ground and suffering from the want of forage and fuel, while the Scots, sheltered by the huts they had erected, and warmed by the great number of fires which they had lighted, kept \" horning with their horns,\" says Froissart, \" and making such a noise as if all the great devds from hell had been there.\" On the fourth morning, to the sur- prise of the English, the camp of the Scots was found deserted and empty. They had secretly decamped in the middle of the night, and had taken up a still stronger position than the former, a few miles farther up the river, near Stanhope park. Edward made a corresponding movement, and en- camped on another hill opposite the Scots, the river Wear flowing between them as before. Shortly after this change of posi- tion, Douglas made a midnight attack on the English camp, which had nearly proved fatal to the young king. Crossing the river with a chosen body of about four hundred horsemen, at a considerable distance above the English position, he gained, unperceived, the rear of their camp, and penetrated to the royal quarters before he was discovered. Then shouting, \"A Douglas! a Douglas!'' he made a furious assault upon the enemy, and killed about three hundred of them. Douglas himself came to the royal tent, cut the tent-ropes, and had nearly succeeded in making the king a prisoner. But his chaplain and chamberlain, and other members of his household, made a brave resistance, and by sacrificing their own lives afforded Edward time to escape. Having thus been baffled in his attempt to seize the king's person, Douglas cut his way through the gathering crowds of his enemies, and regained his friends with very inconsiderable loss. Shortly after this daring attack, the Scots marched away during the night, unheard and unseen by their enemies, and effected their retreat through an extensive morass in the rear of their camp, impassable for heavy armed cavalry, but which their hardy little hackneys crossed without much difficulty. Finding that any attempt to overtake their nimble foes would have been utterly hope less, the English forces marched straight to York, where they were disbanded ; while the Scots regained their own country in safety, laden with the rich booty which they had collected in their successful inroad. The great body of the English barons and people were now tired of the fruitless attempt to subdue Scotland, and, smarting under the devastating inroads of the Scots, were desirous of a lasting peace. Mortimer, and the queen mother too, were, for their own private interests, anxious to put an end to the hostilities which had so long been carried on between the two countries. Bruce, on his part, was determined to make the northern counties feel the effects of his vengeance, in order that he might thus stimulate their desire for peace ; and only a few weeks after the return of Randolph and Douglas to their own country, he invaded England in person at the head of a formi dable army, and sat down before Norham, while one division of his army laid siege to Alnwick and another laid waste the open country of Northumberland But he had 35"], [312, "274 HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

Robert, who was labouring under \" a heavy malady,\" and saw the dangers to which his kingdom would be exposed under the rule of an infant sovereign, was anxious to terminate the war by an honourable treaty. He there fore readily listened to the overtures of the English court, but at the same time re quired, as an indispensable preliminary, that the independence of Scotland should be recognized ; and this demand was acceded to by a Parliament held at York on the 1st of March, 1328. An instrument of renun ciation was drawn up, in which the English monarch renounced, fully and for ever, all claims of dominion and superiority over Scotland. \" Whereas,\" it set forth, \" we, and others of our predecessors, kings of England, have endeavoured to obtain a right of dominion and superiority over the kingdom of Scotland, and have thereby been the cause of long and grievous wars between the two kingdoms : we, therefore, consider ing the numerous slaughters, sins, and bloodshed, the destruction of churches, and other evils brought upon the inhabitants of both kingdoms by such wars, and the many advantages which would accrue to the sub jects of both realms if, by the establishment of a firm and perpetual peace, they were secured against all rebellious designs, have, by the assent of the prelates, barons, and commons of our kingdom, in Parliament assembled, granted, and hereby do grant, for us and our heirs and successors what soever, that the kingdom of Scotland shall remain for ever to the magnificent Prince and Lord Robert, by the grace of God the illustrious king of Scots, an ally and dear friend, and to his heirs and successors, free, entire, and unmolested, separated from the kingdom of England by its respective marches, as in the time of Alexander, king of Scotland, of good memory, lately de- ceased, without any subjection, servitude, claim, or demand whatsoever. And we hereby renounce and convey to the said king of Scotland, his heirs and successors, whatsoever right we or our ancestors in times past have laid claim to in any way over the kingdom of Scotland. And by these same presents we renounce and declare void, for ourselves and our heirs and suc- cessors, all obligations, agreements, or treaties whatsoever touching the subjection of the kingdom of Scotland and the inhabit- ants thereof, entered into between our pre- decessors and any of the kings thereof, or their subjects, whether clergy or laity. And if there shall anywhere be found any letters, charters, muniments, or public instruments, which shall have been framed touching the said obligations, agreements, or compacts, we declare that they shall be null and void, and of no effect whatsoever.

Stipulations were made at the same time for the marriage of Prince David, the heir of the Scottish crown, and the princess Joanna. The two kings pledged themselves to be good friends and faithful allies.

The great work to which the Scottish king had devoted his life was thus at length accomplished, and the freedom and indepen dence of his kingdom fully recognized. He did not long survive this great consumma tion. His constitution was worn out by the fatigues and hardships he had undergone in the long-continued wars with the enemies of his country, and he had for some time been attacked by \"a heavy malady,\" which his enfeebled frame was unable to resist. \" He was grievously oppressed,\" says Frois sart. \" with the great sickness, so that there was no way with him but death.\" He spent the last two years of his life in retirement at Cardross, near Dumbarton, on the Firth of Clyde, and there he died, on the 7th of June, 1329, in the fifty-fifth year of his age and the twenty-third of his reign. He was buried in the choir of the abbey church at Dunfermline.* It was also stipulated, though not included in the treaty, that the famous Stone of Des tiny, or coronation stone, which Edward I. carried off from Scone, should be restored to the Scots, f But the mob of London, among whom the treaty was very unpopular, rose in a riotous manner and prevented the removal of this trophy from Westminster abbey. In return for the advantages which he derived from this treaty, and in compen sation for the damages done by the Scots in their recent invasion, King Robert agreed to pay to the king of England thirty thousand marks. The treaty seems to have excited a strong feeling of disapprobation among the Eng lish people. The national pride was deeply wounded by the surrender of the claim of superiority over Scotland. Their historians termed the peace ignominious, and the mar riage a base alliance. But all reflecting men saw that the treaty was not only just in itself, but was necessary for the welfare of England in the divided and weakened state in which The young king of England had been contracted to Philippa of Hainault by his mother during her last visit to the Con tinent, and the young lady was brought over to England by her uncle, John of Hainault, a little before Christmas, 1328. She was received at London with great pomp, and with \"jousts, tournaments, dances, carols, and great and beautiful re pasts ;\" and on the 24th of January following was married to Edward at York. She proved to him an excellent and affectionate wife, and seems to have been greatly esteemed and beloved by the people of England. that country was then placed.

They occupied the castle, the gates of which were carefully locked every night, and the keys deposited in their own hands ; but there was a subterraneous passage which they had not the means of guarding, through which the conspirators found admission, and surprised them at midnight in circumstances when no resist- ance could be attempted. Conducted a prisoner to London, Roger de Mortimer was accused of various crimes, as well against the public rights as against indi- viduals, whom he had ensnared and de- prived of life. The assassination of the late king was laid to his charge, as well as the unjust sentence recently executed upon the earl of Kent. He was accordingly found guilty, though rather on common report than from an examination of legal evidence, and hanged on a gallows in the neighbour- hood of the capital. Isabella, whatever might be the presumptions against her, was not tried ; but was compelled to retire to a private residence, where, on a reduced in come, she spent the remainder of her days, without ever again acquiring the slightest share of political authority.* A report was industriously circulated that Edward II. was still alive, which drew from his brother, who now saw reason to repent the steps he had taken against him, a letter revealing his secret thoughts and intention. This communication was conveyed to Mor timer, who founded on it a charge of high treason, and obtained the sentence of Par liament condemning the accused to suffer death. This successful stroke emboldened him to undertake measures of similar severity against some of the other nobles, whom he knew to be hostile to his preten sions. Lancaster, who had been raised from the rank of earl of Leicester, was thrown into prison ; not a few, including certain prelates, were subjected to large fines ; estates were seized, and converted to the purposes of oppression ; and menaces were uttered which seemed to expose to imminent hazard the first families in the kingdom.* Sir Simon Bereford, one of Mortimer's accomplices, accompanied him to the gal lows. Three others were condemned to death, but made their escape. One of them, Sir John Maltravers, was afterwards taken and executed. A price was set upon the heads of Gournay and Ogle, the reputed murderers of Edward II. Gournay was arrested in Spain, and put to death on the voyage to England by the officer to whom he was entrusted, in obedience to secret instructions, probably to prevent him from implicating, by his confessions, certain per sons who still retained their influence at court. Ogle is supposed to have died abroad. Edward, whose temper was peculiarly open to the impressions of military fame, and who had not forgotten his abortive efforts against the Scots in his first cam paign, readily listened to certain reasons The usual remedy for such evils in those turbulent, unsettled times, presented itself to the minds of several individuals, who enjoyed the countenance of young Edward, and who began to tremble for the safety of his person and government. It is not known to what extent he himself was privy to the design which was soon formed, for liberat ing him from the control that had now become at once irksome and disgraceful. At all events, it was resolved to take advan tage of a meeting of Parliament about to be held at Nottingham, at which the queen and Mortimer were expected to be present. Surrounded with guards, this guilty couple used every precaution against the machina tions which they had but too much reason * Avesbury, p. 9. Knyghton, p. 2556.

It is true that a treaty, involving a considerable penalty, bound him to preserve peace with his northern neigh bours ; but it was alleged that the main conditions on which the stipulation was founded had not been fulfilled by the son of Robert Bruce. The English nobles complained that the estates northward of the Tweed, which had belonged to their families, were not delivered to them upon the conclusion of hostilities, although the Scots were admitted to the possession of such as they could claim on the opposite side of the same river. But these were mere pretexts for the revival of that claim, so long contested between the two countries, which respected the independence of Scot land, and which was relinquished by Morti mer during the king's minority. ciates, having collected a small army and fleet, set sail from Ravenspur, in Yorkshire ; and, entering the Firth of Forth, landed their forces, amounting to about three thousand men, at Kinghorn, in Fife. They dispersed a small body of the Scots under the earl of Fife, who sought to oppose their progress; and, proceeding northward by Dunfermline, encamped at Forteviot, on the river Earn. On the opposite bank lay the earl of Mar, with a numerous but undisciplined army; containing, however, a number of Baliol's secret friends. Guided by Murray of Tulli bardine, one of these traitors, the English crosssd the Earn by a ford at midnight, and fell upon the Scots, who were buried in slumber, and slaughtered them in great numbers before they were aware of their danger. The rout soon became irretriev able. Upwards of thirteen thousand of the Scots, including the regent and many of the chief nobility, fell in this disastrous and disgraceful conflict, and the whole army was completely dispersed. The behaviour of Edward at this period towards his brother-in-law was most dishon ourable and perfidious. While professing great attachment to the Scottish king, and his determination to respect the treaty of peace, he connived at the hostile proceed ings of Baliol and the disinherited barons, as they were termed, and allowed them to collect their forces and to make preparations for invading Scotland by sea, if not by land. At this critical moment, Scotland was deprived of the only man among the nobles who possessed sufficient ability and experi ence to dispel the storm which was gath ering over the kingdom. The Regent Randolph, to the unspeakable grief of his countrymen, died suddenly at Musselburgh, on the 24th of July, 1332 ; it was believed \u2014 and apparently with reason \u2014 of poison administered by an English friar. Sir James Douglas, the only other man who was sit for the office, had fallen in battle against the Moors, on his expedition with the heart of Brace to the Holy Land. The regency devolved upon Donald, earl of Mar, nephew to Robert Brace, who appears to have been utterly unfitted for an office so arduous and important. The day after the battle, Baliol took pos session of Perth, where he was for some time blockaded by the earl of March, at the head of a strong force. But there was both scarcity and treachery in the Scottish camp, and March himself was strongly suspected of disaffection. He shortly after disbanded his army, and, along with a considerable number of other Scottish nobles, joined the standard of the pretender to the throne. All apparent opposition having thus been put down, Baliol was crowned at Scone on the 24th of September. His first act was to surrender the independence of the kingdom, which had been won at the cost of so much blood and suffering ; to acknowledge the English monarch as his liege lord ; and to cede to him the town, castle, and territory of Berwick, and other lands upon the marches. Edward in return pledged himself to main tain Baliol on the throne, and to support him with the whole military strength of his kingdom.* But the crown, which had been * Rymer, vol. iv. pp. 536, 548.

He was lying in careless security at Annan, in Dum friesshire, intending to pass his Christmas there, when, on the night of the 16th of September, he was surprised by a body of horse, commanded by the young earl of Moray, Sir Simon Fraser, and Sir Archibald Douglas, and was chased across the border almost naked, and with scarcely a single attendant; leaving many of his men, along with his brother Henry, dead behind him. on the 20th of July, if not previously relieved by the regent, who, at the head of a powerful army, was at that time engaged in ravaging Northumberland. Douglas lost no time in marching to the relief of Berwick, and on the 19th of July came in sight of the main army of the English, drawn up on Halidon hill, about a mile to the north-west of the town. Their position was very strong, and was protected by a morass, which intervened between their lines and the opposite eminence on which the Scottish army, amounting to about fifteen thousand men, was drawn up. The Scottish leaders rashly determined to attack their enemies, in spite of the ad- vantageous position which they occupied. Rushing to the charge with their wonted impetuosity, the Scots suffered severely from the deadly discharges of the English archers, while descending the hill and struggling through the morass. Hurrying breathless and disordered up the eminence on which the English were posted, they were unable to sustain the conflict with fresh troops occupying a most advantageous situation ; and, after a brief though fierce straggle, they were repulsed with great slaughter. The regent himself, with the earls of Ross, Lennox, Carrick, Athole, and many other leading nobles, along with many thousands of the common soldiers, were left on this fatal field.* The disastrous battle of Halidon hill was followed by the imme- diate surrender of the town and castle of Berwick, and the almost entire submission of the whole country to Edward. The young king and his consort were conveyed to France, as there seemed no longer any place of safety for them in their own country. Edward Baliol seemed now at length securely seated on the throne of Scotland, and he proceeded, apparently without hesi tation or regret, to pay the immense price which Edward exacted from him in return for his services. The town, castle, and county of Berwick, the forests of Selkirk, Ettrick, and Jedburgh, the counties of On receiving intelligence of the expulsion of Baliol, and of a subsequent inroad which the Scots, in retaliation for the treatment they had received, had made into England, Edward had the effrontery to accuse them of having violated the treaty of North ampton ; and the Parliament, which had pre viously hesitated to countenance his projects on Scotland, was induced by this plausible pretext to furnish him with the necessary supplies. Hostile incursions were made on both sides, in one of which the Scots met with a severe defeat, and Sir William Doug las, the knight of Liddesdale, was taken prisoner.* Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, the regent of Scotland, was captured in an attack on the castle of Roxburgh, in which Baliol had established his quarters.f The loss of these two brave and able leaders was a great calamity to the Scots at this crisis ; and Archibald Douglas, surnamed Tyneman, the new regent, though a man of eminent courage, was otherwise unfitted for the offices and his election was followed by the most disastrous consequences. The first object which engaged the attention of the English monarch, was the capture of Berwick ; and in the month of May, 1333, it was invested by a powerful English army, assisted by a numerous fleet. An attempt to carry the place by storm having failed, the siege was converted into a blockade, and the garrison were at last reduced to such extremities that the gover nor, Sir AVilliam Keith, agreed to surrender * Walsingham, p. 132. f J'ord'im, book xiii chap. 27.

These proceedings gave the deepest offence to the nation, and even estranged some of his own partisans. The adherents of Bruce every where throughout the country rose in arms against the mean-spirited usurper, and speeddy drove him once more across the border, to claim the protection and assistance of his liege lord. In 1335 Edward resolved to undertake a new invasion of Scotland, and on the 11th of July marched from Newcastle at the head of a powerful and well-equipped army, while his fleet sailed for the Firth of Forth, to co-operate with the land troops. One divi sion of the army, led by the king himself, entered Scotland by the western border, while Baliol, at the head of another, ad vanced from Berwick by the eastern. After ravaging the country in all directions with merciless severity, the two divisions formed a junction at Glasgow, and marched to Perth in the month of August. According to the wise policy recommended by King Robert the Scots offered no organized opposition to the invaders, but removed the women and children, with their cattle, to inaccessible fastnesses among the mountains, leaving the low country deserted, at the same time hanging on the rear of the enemy and cutting off detached parties. The people, however, were reduced to a condition of great distress ; and the captivity of the regent, the earl of Moray, and the apostacy of the powerful earl of Athole, who at this crisis revolted to the English, reduced the patriotic cause to the lowest ebb.* Edward, with his usual promptitude, undertook a new expedition into Scotland, for the purpose of regaining his conquests. But taught by experience, the Scots retreated before his approach, avoided a general action, and contented themselves with the attack of posts and detachments, in which success might be important, whde the risk of loss was trifling. Acquainted with the most intricate paths through mountainous dis tricts and marshy plains, the light-armed peasantry were ever ready to assail with unexpected fury the more regular troops who were sent against them; and accord ino-ly, though the invaders found no enemy in the field able to dispute their progress, they could not command any part of the country but that which they actually covered with their camps* After reaching the heart of the Lothians Edward was in consequence obliged to retreat without having accom plished anything of importances At the same time Baliol, with a portion of the army, ravaged Avondale and the districts of Carrick and Cunningham, and then held a court at Renfrew and made great festivity, distributing among his adherents the estates which he declared the nobles hostile to him had forfeited. A gleam of sunshine, however, soon lightened their gloomy prospects, and en couraged them to renew the contest for their national independence with redoubled energy and zeal. The earl of Athole, with the characteristic zeal of an apostate, eager to signalize himself by some brilliant exploit, had laid siege to Kildrummie castle, in which Christian, the sister of Robert Brace and wife of Sir Andrew Moray, had taken refuge. But he was defeated and killed by Moray, who, with the earl of March and the knight of Liddesdale, had hastened to the relief of the fortress. The death of this powerful noble, whose vast influence, courage, and cruelty made him equally dreaded and hated, was a great gain to the patriotic cause. Sir Andrew Moray, who was now chosen regent of the kingdom, was a cool and wary veteran, who had long experience of the mode of * Heming., vol. ii. p. 275. Knyghton, p. 2564.

He foiled a new invasion of the English at this time, not by meeting them in the field, but by wasting the country before them, and by sudden and destructive attacks on their stragglers and detached parties. Edward penetrated as far as Inver ness, ravaging the country and burning many of the towns and villages in his progress; but his troops became straitened for provisions, and he was obliged to return home, leaving matters much as he found them. No sooner had he quitted the kingdom than the patriotic leaders hastened from their mountain fastnesses, burning for vengeance, and assailed and captured the fortresses which still remained in the hands of the English. The regent even made an incursion into England, and wasted the northern provinces with fire and sword.* It was undeniable that the principle as sumed by Edward was a startling novelty, and that even if he had been able to prove it, he would have excluded himself as well as Philip ; for in that case the succession wTould have rested with the son of Joan, queen of Navarre, daughter of Louis, and who was the eldest brother of Isabella, Edward's mother. The French jurists, moreover, maintained it to be a fundamental law that no foreigner could reign in France, and affirmed that one of the principal objects of the Salic law was to exclude the hus bands and children of the French princesses, who generally married foreigners. The people of France were unanimous in their support of Philip of Valois. So were the peers, who had voted that the crown be longed to him. So was the Assembly of Paris, who had issued a decree to the same effect, which was afterwards confirmed by the States General ; and not only the whole French nation, but all Europe, recog nized Philip as the lawful heir of the throne. Edward himself, in 1331, had rendered homage to him for his continental posses sions ; and it was not till 1336 that he resolved to prosecute his claim to the throne, and denounced the decision of the States General and the peers of France. It became evident that arguments derived from reason and grounds of law were of no avail in a case to which no distinct precedent could apply, and which the aggressor was resolved should be determined by the sword. Ac cordingly, on the 7th of October, 1337, Edward declared war against France. In the prospect of taking up arms to vindicate his claims on the French throne, Edward had spared no pains to gain allies on the Continent. Robert of Artois, brother-in-law of Philip, who had, as he thought, been unjustly excluded from the fief of Artois, and driven from France under The Scots were encouraged to persevere in this unequal contest by the knowledge which they possessed that the attention of the English king would soon be drawn to the determination of a question much more interesting to him than even the affairs of Baliol. The death of the French monarch without a direct heir rendered his crown an object of dispute between Edward, who was his grandson by his daughter Isabella, and Philip of Valois, who was his nephew, or the son of his brother. The point at issue turned on that principle of the reputed con stitutional law of the Franks which prevents a female from occupying the throne, and which on this occasion was interpreted by the friends of the latter prince to imply that the throne could not be inherited through a woman. Those who supported the claims of the king of England maintained that though a female, owing to the inferiority of her sex, was herself excluded from govern ing, this incapacity did not disqualify her for transmitting the right of inheritance to a male descendant. It is true that no woman had reigned since the invasion of Clovis, but it was equally clear that no re\u00b0-ular order of succession was yet established ; * Fordun, book xiii. chap. 39.

The chief princes of the Netherlands and of Lower Germany were conciliated to the interests of the English monarch, and among them may be mentioned the count of Hainault, father of Queen Philippa, the dukes of Brabant and of Gueldres, the count of Zealand, the marquis of Juliers, and the archbishop of Cologne. But a more im portant ally than all these was Jacques van Artevelde, a wealthy burgher of Ghent, who had organized the population of that great city, in conjunction with Bruges and Ypres, in their revolt against Louis, earl of Flan ders. His ability and eloquence gave him vast influence over his fellow-citizens, whom for many years he ruled with almost abso lute authority and with great wisdom. \" To speak properly,\" says Froissart, \" there never was in Flanders, nor in any other country, prince, duke, or other that ruled a country so peaceably so long as this Jacques d'Arte ville ruled Flanders.\"* the subsidies of England with alacrity; but at the moment in which their appearance in the field was required, they refused assist ance unless the emperor, to whom they owed fealty as their lord-paramount, could be prevailed upon to sanction the league. The force of the king of England, singly, was insufficient for the great enterprise which he meditated, and time was requisite for negotiations with the imperial court. Louis of Bavaria was far from unwilling to foment the quarrel with France ; and in a diet, held at Coblentz with extraordinary magnificence, he declared that Philip, by neglecting to pay homage for his fiefs, had forfeited the protection which he might otherwise have expected from his sovereign ; he invested Edward in person with the title and privi leges of Vicar of the Empire, on the left bank of the Rhine, as far as Cologne ; and he commanded the princes of the Low Coun tries to yield him military service during seven years ensuing.* The season, however, was now too far advanced for action. The king of England, with his queen and court, passed the winter in festivity at Antwerp ; but the profuse expenditure which the support of his vast armament demanded, the mercenary requi sitions of his allies, and his own taste for luxury, soon exhausted his treasury, and the following September arrived before his troops assembled in their rendezvous near Brussels. Philip, meanwhile, taking advan tage of the defenceless state of the English coast, made a descent upon Southampton, and revenged his defeat at Cadsand by a bloody retaliation. f By the advice of Artevelde, Edward issued a declaration of war, asserting the invalidity of Philip's title to the crown of France. Until he assumed the title of King of France, many of the Flemings had scruples about joining him, as they were vassals, nominally at least, to the French king. His first enterprise was a predatory excursion against Cadsand, in which attempt, although the island was gallantly defended, the English, under the earl of Derby, were completely successful. Guy, an illegitimate brother of the earl of Flanders, who com manded the garrison, was taken prisoner; his best officers, and nearly four thousand of his troops, were slain ; and the invaders, having sacked and pillaged the town, re turned flushed with triumph and laden with booty to their anchorage in the Thames. f Sir Walter Manny, a gallant knight, whose name occurs in almost every page of the chronicles of this war, and is never mentioned without honour \u2014 he \" did so many great prowesses in divers places that * Walsingham's \"Ypodeigma Neustria,\" p. 513.

He sent heralds to the king of England, defying him to combat on a given day, on a plain field where neither party could derive advantage from wood, marsh, or river.f The French exceeded a hundred thousand fighting men ; the English did not amount to quite half that number, for the Germans and the Flemish had refused to pass their frontier. Nevertheless, the challenge was accepted, and the armies confronted each other at Buiron-fosse on the 23rd of October. Never, perhaps, were two equally great hosts so near without striking. That the English should act chiefly on the defensive, is accounted for by their inferiority of numbers ; and for Philip's reluctance to attack, Froissart pre sents us with two reasons. First, says the chronicler, he received letters from the king of Sicily acquainting him, by his skill in astrology and his knowledge of the heavens, that if he fought he should be discomfited ; secondly (and far more probably), his coun cil of war advised him that the stake which he would hazard was unequal to that risked by his opponent \u2014 that he might lose his crown by defeat, whereas no crown was to be gained by victory. \" Thus the battle stode still,\" and the two armies retired at nightfall.J Edward returned to Brussels, and there negotiated, through Van Artevelde, a truly mercenary compact with the Flemings. That people had bound themselves by oath in the papal chamber, under penalty of two millions of florins, never to make war against the king of France ; and hitherto, notwith- standing their league with Edward, they had continued to keep the letter of their bond. In order to remove all scruples to elude their oath, and, yet more, to escape the fine consequent upon its breach, they now proposed that Edward should strengthen his assertion of a claim to the French crown by assuming the royal title, and quartering the French fleurs-de-lis conjointly with the arms of England. \" By this means,\" said Van Artevelde, \" we shall be assured and dispensed withal, and then we will go with you whithersoever you will have us.\" Edward indeed, two years before, in his declaration of war had affirmed his right to the crown of France ; but we are told that he now \" took counsel before he assented to Van Artevelde's proposition ; for he thought it was a serious matter to take on him the arms of France and the name, seeing as then he had conquered nothing thereof and could not tell what should fall thereof, nor whether he should conquer it or not.\" The result of his deliberation, however, was the adoption of the step suggested by his Flemish ally; and the heraldic blazonry which now for the first time appeared on the royal arms of England, during nearly four centuries remained a monument of empty national pretence ; and an appeal was made to the Deity (Bieu et mon droit) in behalf of an alleged right among the most doubtful that have ever been advanced by ambition.* When the king of England crossed battle had begun, and hastily put on their helmets.

The return of Edward was opposed by the French ; and when on Midsummer eve he approached the harbour of Sluys, he discovered a fleet whose masts appeared to him \" like a great wood.\" The French are said to have exceeded forty thousand men guarding one hundred and forty vessels, among which one of the most noted was the huge English ship, the Christopher, captured during the preceding year at Southampton. Edward's first care was to provide for the safety of the brilliant female cortege -which accompanied him \u2014 \"countesses, ladies, knights, nuns, and other damsels, who were going to see the queen at Ghent;\" and having securely disposed of this unwarlike troop under a strong guard in the offing, he arrayed his archers skilfully in front, and tacking in order to gain the wind, afterwards bore down upon the enemy, who had supposed that man\u0153uvre to be the prelude of retreat. The Christopher was the first ship boarded, and the battle then became \" right fierce and terrible,\" more like a combat on land than a naval engagement; for the French remained immovable in their moorings, and the hostile vessels linked themselves to each, other by grappling irons. During six hours, from morning till noon, the hosts fought hand to hand till the French almost to a man were driven into the sea and perished; \"there was not one that escaped, but all were slain.\" Edward, who exhibited much personal bravery and was slightly wounded in the action, remained on ship board during the following night, \" with great noise of trumpets and other instru ments.\" His triumph was sullied by the savage and disgraceful execution of the French admiral, Pierre Behuchet, wh\u00a9 was hanged in cold blood at his own yardarm. The chronicle affirms that this cruelty was perpetrated expressly to spite the king of France ; but it is more probable that Edward was prompted to the act at a time when the laws of war were little understood, or rather had not begun to exist, by resentment for the expedition against Southampton which Behuchct had commanded.* Among Philip's courtiers no one was found hardy enough to convey to him intelligence of this great disaster, and recourse was at length had to the useful agency of his licensed jester. \" Cowardly English ! faint-hearted English ! \" exclaimed the buffoon one day in the royal presence. How so? inquired the king. \" Because they had not the courage to leap out of their ships into the sea, as our brave Normans and Frenchmen have done,\" replied the fool, f Little advantage, however, was reaped by Edward from his victory. The city of Tournay was the object to which he first addressed himself, and he environed it round about with a host of English, Brabantcrs, and men of Hainault, whom Froissart calculates at very nearly one hundred thousand armed men. Anxious, however, for the speedy termination of the campaign, he was eager for a battle which might relieve him from the slow process of a siege; and scarcely had he entered his lines before he offered to meet Philip in single combat, each followed by a hundred knights, or at the head of their respective armies, provided the quarrel was terminated within ten days from the delivery of the challenge. This cartel was addressed to Philip de Valois, and the king of France with becoming dignity declined to recog nize himself under that designation. He upbraided Edward with his breach of vassalage, and answered that he would sifdit at the season most convenient for himself, not at that most desired by his enemy. | More than eleven weeks were spent in a fruitless blockade of Tournay, during which the French, continuing to * Froissart, c.

Philip had created a powerful diversion by inducing the Scots to ravage the north of England; and Edward per ceived his treasure hourly diminishing with little chance of commensurate advantage in return. The princess Jeanne of Valois, sister of Philip, and mother of Philippa queen of England, was indefatigable in labouring for peace. Her other daughters had married the emperor Louis of Bavaria and the marquis of Juliers, and the influ ence of these powerful connections at length rendered her mediation successful. The status quo was the basis of a truce for six months, preparatory to a congress which might treat of a definite peace, and the two monarchs, heartily wearied of a ruinous and inconclusive war, repaired each to his own court. was at first esteemed a mere private broil ; and when Montfort lost Nantes his capital, was taken prisoner, and conveyed to the tower of the Louvre, his cause would have been ruined but for the masculine courage of his high-minded countess. Margaret, sister of the earl of Flanders, one of the most extraordinary heroines either of her own or any other age,* is described to have had the courage of a man and the heart of a lion.f She animated her followers by bearing about and exhibiting to them her infant son, whom she devoted to be his father's restorer and avenger. Then, having garrisoned and provisioned her other for tresses, she fixed her own head-quarters at Hennebon, a convenient port, where she resolved to await the succours promised by England. After Rennes had been taken, and Hennebon was beleaguered, the countess donned a suit of mail and rode about on a spirited horse from street to street, animating the citizens to make a valiant defence. On one occasion, at the head of three hundred horse, she made a brilliant sortie and fired the quarters of the besieging host. Her re turn, indeed, was intercepted at the moment, but during four days, in which she traversed the neighbourhood, she raised a sufficient force to reconduct her in safety to her strong hold. The assaults, however, continued to be so fierce, and the walls were so \" bruised and broken,\" that the leaders of the garrison began to talk about surrender. Margaret in vain requested three days' delay; a parley had already commenced, when the countess \" looked down along the sea from a window in the castle, and began to smile for great joy that she had to see the succours coming which she had so long desired. Then she cried out aloud twice, ' I see the succours of England coming.' \" f Neither party, under existing circum stances, could feel anxious for a speedy renewal of hostilities, and the armistice accordingly was prolonged for more than a year after its original term had expired. A disputed succession in France, however, offered an alliance to Edward which promised unforeseen advantage, and the contest was then renewed with more than former animosity. In consequence of a failure in the direct lineal succession, the duchy of Brittany was claimed both by Charles, count of Blois, in right of his wife, a niece of the late duke ; and by John of Montfort, a surviving half-brother. Charles of Blois was nephew to the king of France ; and when the court of the Parliament of Paris decided, as it might have been expected to do, in his favour, his defeated competitor hastened to England, and offered homage to Edward for the fief of Brittany, provided he would undertake its recovery. Edward accepted his services, and created him Earl of Richmond* Notwithstanding the forces both of England and of France appeared as auxiliaries, the war between Charles of Blois and Montfort Sir Walter Manny had been detained sixty days by contrary winds ; but his arrival brought effectual relies to Hennebon. The siege was raised immediately, and the * His patent is dated Feb. 20, 1342. Fordun, vol. ii. * See her character quoted from Argentre, by Velly, iv. 493. part ii. p. 1187. f Froissa t, c. Ixxi. X Froissart, c. lxxx."], [323, "A.d. 1343-1345.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 285 war was carried by the French into Lower Brittany. The countess hastened to Eng land, and speedily re-embarked in company with a larger force under Robert of Artois. The invading armament was encountered near Guernsey, by a squadron which Philip had hired from Spain and Genoa. After a bloody and indecisive combat, the two fleets parted during night in the midst of a violent tempest. The countess of Montfort, who was on board, \" that day was worth a man; she had in her hand a sharp glaive, wherewith she fought fiercely.\"* The English vessels which drew little water made for the coast, and the city of Vannes, after a brisk defence, was carried by assault. This conquest, however, was not long retained. Before its breaches could be repaired, the French had collected so over powering a force that they re-established themselves in its possession; and Robert of Artois, who had been grievously hurt in its defence, and was afterwards conveyed to England, languished for a short time in London, and there died of his wounds. \"f Philip's first ordonnances after the truce of Malestroit established a monopoly of salt throughout the kingdom; and la Gabelle, a name applicable to taxes generally, hence forward became appropriated to this most odious and tyrannical impost. The wits of the time (the jest has been ascribed to no less an author than Edward III. himself) stigmatized the king as the founder of the Salic law. Philip, in return, nicknamed his competitor \"a wool merchant;\" for wool was the English product which bore the surest price in foreign markets, and was consequently the commodity in which the Parliaments usually made their grants to the king. The glimpses we obtain of Philip's internal administration are not calculated to impress us with a favourable opinion of his justice and integrity. He had recourse to the perilous expedient of first raising and then depreciating the standard of coinage, according as his disbursements or his receipts predominated at the moment. He enticed Olivier de Clisson, Godfrey de Harcourt, and other twelve of the chief nobles of Britanny and Normandy to court, and then caused them to be arrested suddenly, in the midst of a tournament, and executed without even the form of a trial, or any kind of legal examination. The king of England, loudly inveighing against this slaughter of his friends as an act of treachery and as an infraction of the treaty, despatched his cousin Henry of Lancaster, earl of Derby, to Bourdeaux, with a force sufficient to spread terror through Guienne and the adjoining provinces. This enter prise was eminently successful. The earl defeated the French in a decisive battle near Auberoche, took many prisoners, and drove them out of the country. It is highly probable that this defeat and loss so far irritated Edward that he determined on a personal re-appearance on the scene of contest; but Froissart must be mistaken in the detailed account which he gives that the \" king of England swore that he would never rest till he had revenged the death of Robert d' Artois, and said that he would go himself unto Brctagne, and bring the country in such case that it should not be recovered again for forty years after.\"* The death of Robert did not occur till the middle of November, and Edward embarked at Sandwich on the 5th of October. His force was sufficiently large to enable him to under take at one and the same time the sieges of Vannes, of Nantes, and of Dinant. In the last only of these enterprises was he successful, and the mediation of the pope's legates once more established a truce for nearly four years between parties alike exhausted by a severe contest. In order to recruit his exhausted treasury, one of Edward had reserved the north for his own exploits, and accompanied by the flower of his nobility, he disembarked at Sluys on the invitation of his old ally, Jacques van Artevelde. His main object was to induce the Flemings to transfer f Id c. xciii. * Froissart, c. xcviii. * Froissart, c. lxxxi."], [324, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

When he saw that he could not appease them, he drew in his head and closed the window, and so thought to steal out on the backside into a church that joined his house ; but it was so broken that four hundred persons were entered in, and finally there he was taken and slain without mercy, and one Thomas Denys a saddler gave him his death stroke.\" \"Poor men,\" adds Froissart, \"first raised him, and wicked men killed him.\"* their allegiance from the count of Flanders to his son, the prince of Wales. But many of the burgomasters were opposed to this extreme measure, and the great authority which Van Artevelde had so long possessed, though for the most part used wisely and patriotically, had raised him up numerous enemies. Some of the wealthy burghers, jealous of his superior influence, secretly accused him to the rabble of having im poverished his country in order to fill the coffers of Edward, and the proposition which he now hazarded gave colour to the suspicion that he had sold himself to that prince. During his absence from the city for the purpose of conferring with Edward, the popular discontent aggravated by these sinister rumours was excited in a high degree, and \" set them of Gaunt on fire.\" \" As he rode into the town about noon, they of the town knew of his coming, and many were assembled together in the street where he should pass ; and when they saw him they began to murmur, and to run together their heads in one hood, and said, ' Behold yonder great master who will order all Flanders after his pleasure, the which is not to be suffered.' As he rode through the street he perceived that there was some new matter against him, for he saw such as were wont to make reverence to him as he came by, turn their backs towards him and enter into their houses. Then he began to doubt, and as soon as he was alighted in his lodging he closed fast his doors, gates, and windows. This was scant done but all the street was full of men, and especially those of the small crafts, who assailed his house both behind and before.\" With the help of his faithful servants he defended his house for some time ; but the mob still increased in numbers, and his mansion was attacked on all sides, so that further resist ance became hopeless. Then Van Artevelde addressed them bareheaded from an upper window, and said, \" Good people, what aileth you, and why are you so troubled against me?\" 'We want to have an account of the great treasures of Flanders which you have On receiving intelligence of this unex pected catastrophe, Edward hastily and indignantly returned to Sandwich, breath ing vengeance against the Flemings, who had thus murdered his most valuable ally. His threatenings produced great consterna tion among the free towns, whose prosperity depended on their trade, and that trade in a great measure depended on England. They were well aware that if Edward should prohibit the exportation of English wool, or prohibit the importation of their manufactured goods, they would be nearly ruined. The cities of Ypres, Bruges, Cour tray, and other chief towns which had not actively participated in the tumult, sent deputies to London to appease the anger of the English king. They assured him of their undiminished affection to his per son and interests, and they suggested a marriage between the princess his daughter and their own young prince, as a more certain mode of transferring the inheritance to his family than any forcible change of dynasty could offer. Policy on both sides recommended reconciliation, and we are by no means surprised to hear, that \"finally the king was contented with the Flemings, and they with him ; and so, little and little, the death of Jacques Dartnell was forgotten.\" On what occasion indeed, in the history of mankind, has the remembrance of past services to a people been allowed to coun terbalance the weight of present interest ? Freed from the apprehension of danger in the north of his kingdom, Philip directed * Froissart, c. cxv."], [325, "A.d. 1346.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 287 his entire force to expel the carl of Derby from Guienne. The army assembled in the following spring, under the command of his son John duke of Normandy, near Tou louse, is estimated, as usual, in round numbers at one hundred thousand men ; yet this mighty host was held in check by the little town of Aiguillon,* into which Derby had thrown a garrison of fifteen hundred picked and resolute soldiers under Sir Walter Manny; and the French prince, baffled in all his attacks, was compelled to lie before the walls in the hope of winning by famine that which he could not gain by assault, f Edward, meantime, having resolved to rein force his troops in Guienne, gathered at Southampton a well-appointed force, muster ing four thousand men-at-arms and ten thousand archers, besides Irishmen and Welshmen who followed on foot, J The prince of Wales, a youth of fifteen, on this occasion commenced his memorable career of glory. \"burned, exiled, robbed, wasted, and pilled,\" all that rich province. Harflcur, Cher bourg, Carentan, and St. Lo were stormed; and on the sack of Caen more than five thousand of the inhabitants were put to the sword. The fleet was then sent back to England, silled with booty and prisoners; and Edward, passing up the left bank of the Seine, spread his ravages to the very gates of Paris. Philip, at his approach, retired to St. Denis, and having there col lected a body of troops far greater than that of the invaders, confidently expected to prevent their further progress. To retreat upon a spoiled and exhausted country was not less hazardous to the English than to risk battle with an enemy, however superior in numbers ; and Edward, who calculated upon being reinforced by the Flemings if he could once gain Ponthieu, having de ceived his enemy by a feint, crossed the Seine at Poissy. A considerable tract of hostile country was still to be penetrated, and another river, the Somme, was to be forced, before he could hope to re-embark. All the bridges had been destroyed or were in the possession of the French ; and the ford of Blanche-tache near the mouth of the river, not far from Abbeville, which was indicated to him by some prisoners as passable twice a day at the ebb of the tide, appeared the spot most suited to his operations. The king of England, after receiving the welcome intelligence, \" slept not much that night ; \" a forced march brought him by sunrise to the ford ; and although the waters were still high, and a strong detachment of the French army defended the opposite bank, his marshals boldly entered the stream \" in the name of God and St. George.\" After a severe strug gle in which many knights showed them selves \" as glad to joust in the water as on dry land,\" * the French were completely routed ; and scarcely had the conquerors emerged from the river, which the return of the tide was now rapidly filling, when the main body of the French, headed by their king and Contrary winds altered the destination of this armament from the Gascon to the Nor man coast. On landing at La Hogue, an incident occurred in which Edward dis played a presence of mind not inferior to that of Julius Caesar in Africa, and of William the Conqueror when springing from his boat to the beach at Pevensey. \" When the king,\" says Froissart, \" issued out of his ship, the first foot that he set on the ground he fell so rudely that the blood bur^t out of his nose. The knights that were about him took him up and said, ' For God's sake enter again into your ship, and come not abroad this day, for this is but an evil sign for us.' Then the king answered quickly, and said, 'Wherefore ? this is a good token for me, for the land desireth to have me !

The Somme, however, was no longer practi cable, and Edward continued his march in security. The few hours thus gained by the English were invaluable, and Edward, who neither sought nor perhaps had it in his power any longer to avoid battle, if his enemy should offer it, on the following day took up an advantageous position, and gave his troops repose. The spot on which he halted was near the village of Crecy, and there, \" on the heritage of the queen his mother, the which land was given at her marriage,\" he resolved to abide his adver sary. Having entertained his chief lords at supper, he entered his oratory after their departure, and devoutly prayed for God's blessing on the morrow. About midnight he laid him down to rest, and on the morning betimes he heard mass in com pany with the prince, his son, and was confessed and houselled. The rashness of the French was strikingly contrasted with this calm and discreet generalship. When Philip found immediate pursuit unavailing, he returned to Abbeville ; and there having abode one day, in order that the whole of his great force might be concen trated, on the Saturday morning he advanced a distance of six leagues to the English position. Four experienced knights whom he sent forward to reconnoitre, advised him to defer the engagement till the following day, and he accordingly gave orders for the army to halt. The van obeyed, but the middle battle and rear continued to press forward till they came in sight of the enemy, in bad order and almost total dis array. \" There is no man,\" says Froissart, \" unless he had been present, that can imagine or truly record the confusion of that day, especially the bad management and disorder of the French, whose troops were innumerable.\" At their approach, the English sprang from the ground, and rose upon their feet fair and easily, without any haste ; and Philip, perceiving that battle could no longer be declined, ordered his Genoese crossbows, about fifteen thousand men, to commence the attack. The English were arrayed in three lines. The first, under the command of the prince of Wales gallantly supported, consisted of eight hundred men-at-arms, two thousand archers, and one thousand others, with the Welshmen; the second division, led by the earl of Northampton, comprised about eight hundred men-at-arms and one thou sand two hundred archers ; the reserve, under the king himself, consisted of seven hundred men-at-arms and two thousand archers. In the rear were placed the bag gage, cars, and horses, for every fighting man was on foot; and this \"park,\" as it was called, which had been formed by a wood side, was approached by only a single entry. Thus having disposed his troops, Edward rode from rank to rank, giving them per sonal encouragement, and desiring each private soldier to take heed that day for his right and honour. By the time he had visited all his battle it was nine of the clock, and he then ordered them to take refresh ment; and every man having breakfasted, lay down on the earth, having his helmet and his bow beside him, that he might It was now towards four in the afternoon, and the Genoese, wearied by the length of their march, at first declined to engage; and while the count of Alencon, the king's brother, was endeavouring to restore order and to shame them to the onset, by re proaches and invectives, their alarm was increased by an eclipse of the sun, accom panied with a heavy rain and thunder; \" and before the rain there came flying over both battles a great number of crows, for fear of the tempest coming.\" The English archers had preserved their bow-strings dry within their helmets; those of the Genoese arbalisters were soaked by the storm; and when it ceased, the sun, on its re-appearance, shone full in their eyes, and upon their enemies' backs. While advancing within shot, the Genoese thrice shouted, thinking"], [327, "a.d. 1346.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 289 to strike terror into their opponents; but the English removed not one foot. The vol ley from the damaged crossbows, although fiercely shot, did little mischief; but it was returned by the archers so thickly that it seemed snow; and when the Genoese felt the arrows piercing through heads, arms, and breasts, many of them cast down their crossbows and cut their strings, and took to flight. The king, irritated at this cowardice, ordered his men-at-arms to ride down and slay the fugitives. Many thus fell by the hands of their allies, many more by a second voUey from the English, who shot again into the thickest press, and increased the confusion. Even of the men-at-arms great numbers were overthrown, and being unable to rise on account of the heaviness of their armour, they were de spatched by the long knives of the irregular foot who followed in the English army.* Notwithstanding this great check in the outset, the superior numbers of the French and the gallantry of Alencon enabled them to press hardly upon the first division of the English. The second moved on to support its comrades, and the prince of Wales sent a message to the king to urge the advance of the reserve. \"Is my son dead, or hurt, or on the earth felled?\" was the king's first inquiry ; and when he learned that he was still safe, he refused to move from his own post so long as the prince should remain alive. \" Let them suffer him,\" he added, \" this day to win his spurs; for if God be pleased, I will this journey be his, and the honour thereof, and to them that be about him.\" Far more encouraged by this noble reply than by any reinforcement which could have been sent, the leading divisions stood firm ; not a man stirred from his rank, even to secure a prisoner; and the French again giving way, the rout, in which Alencon was slain, became general. When the king of Bohemia, who, not withstanding his defective sight,! was mounted and in the field, heard of the rout of the Genoese, he earnestly requested those about him to carry him so far forward that he might strike one stroke with his sword. His knights, in order to prevent the risk of losing their master in the press, fastened his bridle to their own, and they then charged so home, that the gallant old man \" strake a stroke with his sword, yea, and moe than four, and fought valiantly, and so did his company, and they adventured themselves so forward that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.\" \\ Philip had endeavoured to join in this brave charge which followed on the over throw of the Genoese ; but he was prevented by a \" great hedge of archers.\" A horse had been shot under him by an arrow,* and towards evening, when not above threescore attend ants were left about his person, Sir John of Hainault took his bridle perforce, and com pelled him to quit the field. It was dark before he arrived at the castle of La Broye, and its gates were closed till they were un barred to the challenge of \" the Fortune of France.\" With a scanty train of five barons in his company, the king, after partaking of rived from John of Bohemia, although we cannot discover any authority for Edmonson's bold assertion that the Black Prince aslew him, and having deplumed his casque or helmet of these feathers and coronet, wore them himself in honour of the vic tory obtained.\" Complete Body of Heraldry, vol. i. * Thomas Walsingham, who is little to be trusted here, says that Philip was wounded in two places, and twice un horsed by the King of England.

Henry of Knyghton says that Philip was wounded in the face by an arrow (p. 2588). But that chronicler's acquaintance with the details of the battle may be fittingly estimated from the returns which he gives of the loss on the part of the English as having been only four men. Hume, who has adopted this report in his tex{, qualifies it by the unauthorized addition of \" and very few of inferior rank.\" * \" And also among the Englysshemen there were ceitayne rascalles that went a fote, with great knives, and they went in among the men of armes and slewe and murdredde many as they lay on the grounde, both erles, baronnes, knyghtes, and squyers, whereof the king of Englande was after dis pleased, for he had rather they had been taken prisoners.\" \u2014 Froissart, e. exxx.

The middle of the following June arrived, and the wretched inhabitants, under their gallant leader, John de Vienne, were already beginning to be grievously straitened for supplies, before Philip was able so far to revive the broken spirits of his nobles as to gather them once more in the field. The siege of Aiguillon had been raised a few days before the defeat at Crecy,* and the troops recalled from that service assisted to replaee the many thou sands who had been lost. Nevertheless, so great was the national panic, that nearly twelve months elapsed before a new army could be completely organized. Even when the force was assembled and in motion, Calais was too effectually covered by the Flemings on the one side, and by the English on the other, to permit approach ; and the famished burghers, after seeing the king's standard displayed within view of their ramparts, were overwhelmed with despair at its unexpected disappearance. some hasty refreshment, procured guides, and then, riding all night, arrived by day break at Amiens. Not till the victory was fully achieved did the king of England join his son. He then went to him with all his followers, and em braced him in his arms and kissed him, and said, \"Fair son, God give you good perse verance; you are my good son; thus you have acquitted yourself nobly; you are worthy to keep a realm.\" The prince bent his knee in honour to his father; and that night they thanked God for their good adven ture, and made no boast thereof. On the morrow numerous stragglers were inter cepted, and two large detachments com manded by the archbishop of Rouen and the grand prior of France, wholly ignorant of the defeat of the preceding day, and pre paring to join Philip's standard, were cut off almost to a man.* The heralds, who were appointed to number the enemy's dead, re ported that they had counted eleven great princes, eighty bannerets, twelve hundred knights, and more than thirty thousand others.t Such was the memorable battle of Crecy, which was fought on Saturday, the 26 th day of August, 1346. Philip having found it impossible to advance whilst his enemy continued to occupy the sand-banks and marshes, had recourse to the customary expedient of a challenge to combat on equal ground; and when Edward prudently declined the invi tation, the French withdrew. Thus extricated by his own valour, and by the presumptuous confidence of his enemy, from a peril which seemed to menace over whelming destruction, Edward was left free to choose his own future operations. In about a week after his great victory he sat down under the walls of Calais; and well aware that their strength forbade all hope of capture by assault, he prepared to reduce The incidents connected with the surren der of Calais have been registered among the proverbs of history. When John de Vienne * Froissart relates a very romantic adventure of Sir Walter Manny after the siege of Aiguillon had been raised. By releasing a kinsman of the duke of Normandy without ransom (an abandonment on his part of at least ten thousand crowns), he obtained from that prince a safe-conduct for himself and twenty knights to ride across France to the camp of Edward before Calais. At Orleans, however, he was arrested, and but for the strong representations of the duke of Normandy, and a threat that he would never again draw sword in his father's service if the king perpetrated so dishonourable an act, Manny would have been put to deah. Philip in the end not only released his prisoner, but admitted him as a guest to his table, and dismissed him with costly presen's amounting to one thousand florins in value. These were accepted by Sir Walter, subject to his master's approbation; and when Edward ex pressed a wish that they should be returned, they were sent back with a courteous refusal. The king of France declined to receive again the jewels which he had once given, and the messenger, a cousin of Sir Walter, was ultimately benefited by them. Sir Mansac, we are told, with much simplicity, \"thanked the king, and was not in will to say nay \" (vol. i. c. cxxxvi) * Froissart says that he was assured four times as many of the commons and infantry were killed on the Sunday morn ing as had fallen in the great battle of the day before. t Froissart, c. cxxxii. vol. i. We have chiefly relied upon this writer's very animated narrative of the battle of Crecy. G. Villani, lib. xii. c. 65, speaks of cannon which Edward intermingled with his archers, and describes their effect as most fearful. Mr. Turner has rejected this testimony, because, as Froissart does not mention the fact, \" the more recent Italian author Villani is not a sufficient authority.\" (History of England during the Middle Ages, vol. ii. p. 208, note 100.) This oversight is remarkable in a writer so greatly distin guished for accuracy and research as is Mr Turner. Froissart was born in 1337. G. Villani died in 1348. M. de Sismondi admits the fact undoubtingly, both in his account of the battle of Crecy (Hist, des Francais, torn. x. p. 297), and again in an incidental notice (Hist, des Rep. Ital., torn. vi. p. 7), and in the former place be adds a strong confirmatory note."], [329, "a.d. 1347.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 291 was compelled by extremity of famine* to ask for no more than the lives of his comrades and of himself, Edward sternly refused all mercy. \" Sir Walter Manny, and many barons who were then present, pleaded in favour of the men of Calais. ' I will not be alone against you all,\" said the king. \" Sir Walter, you wfll tell the captain that six of the notable burgesses must come forth naked in their shirts, bare-legged, with halters round their necks, and the keys of the town and castle in their hands. On these I will do my will, and the rest I will take to my mercy.' When Sir Walter Manny reported this hard condition to John de Vienne, that governor went to the market-place and ordered the church bells to be rung: the people \u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 re paired to the spot, and when they heard Edward's message they all wept piteously, and were incapable of forming any resolution. Things were in this state when the richest burgess of the town, who was called Messire Eustace de St. Pierre, rose up and said, before them all \u2014 ' Gentlemen, great and small, it were great pity to let these people perish ; I wdl be the first to offer up my life to save theirs.' After him another notable burgess, a very honest man, and of great business, rose and said that he would accompany his compeer, Messire Eustace; and this one was named John d'Aire. After him rose up James de Wisant, who was very rich in goods and lands, and said that he would accompany his two cousins, as did Peter Wisant his brother: then the fifth and the sixth offered themselves, which completed the number the king demanded. The governor, John de Vienne, mounted a small hackney, for his wounds prevented him from walking, and conducted them to the gate. The English barriers were opened, and the six were admitted to the presence of Edward, before whom they prostrated themselves, and, presenting the keys, begged for mercy. All the barons, knights, and others who were there present, shed tears of pity, but Edward eyed them very spitefully, for much did he hate the people of Calais ; and then he commanded that their heads should be struck off. Every Englishman entreated him to be more merciful, but he would not hear them. Then Sir Walter Manny said, ' Ha ! gentle sire, let me beseech you to restrain your wrath. You are renowned for nobleness of soul, do not tarnish your reputation by such an act as this. These worthy men have, of their own free will, nobly put themselves at your mercy, in order to save their fellow citizens.' Upon this the king made a grimace, and said, ' Let the headsman be summoned.' But the queen of England, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, fell on her knees, and with tears, said, ' Ah ! gentle sire, since I have crossed the sea with great danger I have never asked you any thing: now, I humbly pray for the sake of the Son of the Holy Mary and your love of me, that you will have mercy on these six men.' The king looked at her and was silent awhile, then he said, ' Dame, I wish you had been somewhere else, but I cannot refuse you \u2014 I put them at your disposal.' Philippa caused the halters to be taken from their necks, gave them proper clothes, and a good dinner, and then dismissed them with a present of six nobles each.\"* On taking possession of Calais, Edward's first design was to transmute it wholly into an English colony. For that purpose he removed all its ancient inhabitants, and sup plied their place by foreign settlers. Great liberties and franchises were granted to the new comers, and thirty-six burgesses, \" rich and sage,\" migrated from London with their wives and children. But it was soon thought prudent to re-admit the French, whose attachment was far greater to their domestic hearths than to the native prince who had failed them in the hour of need. Within two months after the conquest of Calais, many of its principal former inhabitants were * A letter intercepted by Edward, which has been printed by Knyghtoo (p. 2593), sufficiently avouches the horrible sufferings of the inhabitants, who were reduced to eat horses, dogs, and vermin of all kinds, and yet were unable to sustain existence. Knygfrton also mentions that on the day of the surrender, when Edward sent provisious into the town, three hundred persons died by eating too greedily after their long fast. * Froissart, vol. i. c. cxlvi."], [330, "292 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1348. for his love, \" as the best doer in arms in the journey past of either party,\" and accom panying these courteous words by his release without payment of ransom.* permitted to re-occupy their properties, and among the first who proffered allegiance to Edward, and whose fidelity could require no further guarantee than his own word, was Eustace de St Pierre. The conclusion of a truce for two years gave a short season of repose to exhausted France; and although its conditions were ill observed, there is no proof that Philip was privy to their violation. Meanwhile, the English forces stationed in Scotland, under the earls of Salisbury, Arundel, and Norfolk, had been unable to maintain their ground against the patriotic leaders. Salisbury had failed ignominiously in his attempt to reduce the castle of Dunbar, which was defended with signal bravery by the countess of March, daughter of the illustrious Randolph earl of Moray. The knight of Liddesdale drove the Eng lish from Teviotdale, reduced the strono fortress of Hermitage, and defeated Roland de Vaux and Sir Laurence Abernethy (a Scottish noble in the interest of Baliol); while Sir Alexander Ramsay not only inflicted great damage on the enemy in Scotland, but penetrated into Northumber land, wasted the country with fire and sword, and carried off a great booty and many prisoners. Even the death of the veteran patriot Sir Andrew Moray did not materially check the tide of success; and the Steward of Scotland, his successor in the office of regent, showed himself every way worthy of the important trust. He speedily made himself master of the strong fortresses of Perth and Stirling. Edward Baliol was once more compelled to take refuge in England ; and of all the English conquests in Scotland, nothing now re- The government of Calais had been en trusted to a Lombard knight, Aimery, or more properly Amerigo, of Pavia ; and the neighbouring commander of St. Omer, Geoffroy de Charnai, \" bethinking him how the Lombards naturally be covetous,\" con cluded a bargain for its betrayal at the price of twenty thousand crowns. Edward was advised of this perfidious negotiation, and he counteracted it by terrifying Aimery into the commission of a double treachery. On the night of the 31st December, upon which the French were to be admitted to Calais, the king having secretly crossed from Dover with three hundred men-at-arms, and six hundred archers, overpowered the detachment sent to receive possession of the castle ; and then falling upon De Charnai's main body, took him prisoner after an obstinate combat. Edward's personal adventures in this engage ment strongly illustrate the nature of the times ; and his forgetfulness of the character of a king in that of a soldier, much as it maybe condemned by the sobriety of political wisdom, was strictly in accordance with the glowing and generous spirit of chivalry. The king and the prince of Wales sought as private knights under the banner of Sir Walter Manny, whom he appointed chief of the enterprise; and the king on foot, and unknown among his enemies, was engaged in a long single combat with Sir Eustace of Ribamont, \" a strong and a hardy knight,\" who, after twice striking his opponent on his knees, yielded himself prisoner. When Edward entertained his captives at supper after the battle, he took from his own brows a costly chaplet of pearls, and placed it on those of Sir Eustace, desiring him to wear it * Froissart, v. i. c. clii. Edward's address to Sir Geoffrey de Charnai is honourable to his self-restraint. \"When he came to Sir Geoffrey de Charnai, a little he changed his coun tenance and looked on him, and said, ' Sir Geoffrey, by reason I should love you but a little, when you would steal by night from me that thing which I have so dearly bought, and hath cost me so much gold, I am right joyous and glad that I have taken you with the proof. You would have had a better market than I have had when you thought to have Calais for twenty thou-and crowns, but God hath holpen me, and you have failed in your purpose,' and therewith the king went from him, and he gave never a word to answer.\" Froissart relates also that De Charnai, after recovering his liberty, found means to surprise Aimery of Pavia while he was in company with a beautiful English mistress, and put him to a cruel death in St Omer. Edward, in the interview with Aimery in which he concocted his measures, taxed him with having been persuaded to betray \"the thing in the world that I love best, next my wife and children.\" In equally high estimation does Calais seem to have been held by each of our succeeding monarchs.

A strong desire was now entertained by the Scottish leaders that their youthful king, who had for some years resided in France, should return to his own dominions. Accordingly, David and his consort landed at Inverbervie on the 4th of June, 1341, and were enthu siastically welcomed by his subjects. But the son of the great Bruce, now in his eighteenth year, soon began to exhibit a character which differed widely from that of his heroic father. He was, indeed, possessed of a goodly frame and of personal intrepidity, but he was headstrong, violent in his passions, and immoderately fond of pleasure and self-indulgence. His feeble rule and obstinate persistence in his own purposes brought great disasters on his kingdom. and protracted straggle, in which the archers did great execution on the Scottish men-at-arms before the main bodies could meet, victory fell to the English. The earls of Moray and Strathearn, the con stable, the marshal, the chancellor, and the lord chamberlain, with thirty other nobles, and many thousands of the common soldiers, were left on the field; and David himself was wounded, and taken prisoner along with the earls of Fife, Monteith, Sutherland, Wigton, and fifty other barons and knights.* The prisoners were shortly after conducted to London, and con fined in the Tower, where, with a mean and contemptible parsimony, Edward com pelled them to support themselves at their own expense. The earls of Fife and Monteith were brought to trial on a charge of treason, because they had at one time been adherents of Baliol, and by the express orders of the king were condemned to death. Monteith was executed with all the shock ing barbarities sanctioned by the English law; but the earl of Fife had his life spared on account of his relationship to the royal family of England, his mother having been niece to Edward I. In 1344 a two years' truce was concluded between the two countries, which was to last tiU Martinmas, 1346. But some months before its expiry, David was urgently entreated by the French king to make a diversion in his favour by renewing the war with England. In compliance with this request of his ally, he assembled a numerous army at Perth, and, marching to the border, entered England by the western frontier. After capturing the castle of Liddell, he marched eastward to Hex ham, plundering and laying waste the country. He then proceeded towards Durham, carrying everywhere rapine and ruin, and encamped at a place now called Bear-park, within a short distance of the city. Here he was suddenly attacked on the 17th October by a powerful English army, amounting to thirty thousand men, collected by the great northern barons of England and by Edward Baliol, rein forced by the church vassals and by ten thousand soldiers, who were in readi ness to join the forces of Edward before Calais. The Scottish forces were hastily drawn up in three divisions, in a most unfavourable position for supporting each other in the conflict. After a fierce The disastrous overthrow of Neville's Cross, as this battle was called, once more reduced the affairs of the Scottish people to the lowest ebb. The whole country, with the fortresses of Roxburgh and Hermitage, was at once abandoned to the enemy. Edward now thought his conquest so secure that he laid aside all pretence of supporting the claims of Baliol to the crown, and demanded that the Scottish barons should pay homage to him as their sovereign. But the Scottish people, though cast down, were not in despair. They appointed the High Steward, the heir of the crown, to the office of guardian of the kingdom, and prepared to renew the struggle with indomitable resolution. While the brilliant success which attended the arms of Edward lighted up a glow of festivity and congratulation in England, the * Fordun, book xiv. c. 3.

Marching next to the south east he captured and plundered the wealthy cities of Carcassonne and Narbonne, in flicting great misery on the people, but without achieving any permanent success. The English monarch himself made a simultaneous invasion of the northern pro vinces ; but the country had been cleared of everything before his approach, and he was obliged through want of provisions to retreat to Calais. country was visited in 1348 with a dreadful calamity in the form of a pestilence. This frightful scourge, which originated in the northern parts of Asia, passed over the larger portion of Europe, and is computed to have carried off nearly one-third of the inhabitants in every nation which it was permitted by Divine Providence to attack. In London alone the deaths are said to have amounted to fifty thousand ; an immense number, considering the small population of the capital at that period. The malady extended even to the brute creation, and the carcasses of sheep, oxen, and horses were seen scattered in the fields. It was remarked, that the birds of prey abstained from feeding on these corrupted masses, warned by an instinct to avoid the infection arising from premature decay. The labours of husbandry were suspended; the courts of justice were closed; Parliament prorogued its sittings; and the whole atten tion of the public was confined to the means of shunning the approach of an evil which no human care could either alleviate or remove. Upon the renewal of war between France and England, the Scots availed themselves of the favourable opportunity thus afforded them to cross the borders, laying waste the richest plains of Northumberland, and loading themselves with plunder. Edward, upon receiving intelligence of this inroad, which at first seemed to threaten serious consequences, returned home, and solicited aid from his Parliament. A liberal subsidy being granted, he assumed the command of his army in the north, and advanced to Berwick, which had been surprised by the invaders. Not having obtained possession of the castle, and sensible that they could not stand their ground against one of the best leaders of the age, at the head of resolute and practised soldiers, the Scots retreated towards the mountains, leaving the low country at the mercy of the incensed king, who pursued their footsteps. To punish when he could not conquer, he gave orders that every house and village within twenty miles of the sea-coast should be reduced to ashes, and that everything which could be removed should be taken away. On this occasion he obtained from Baliol, who was now advanced in years, the resignation of a throne which he had not been allowed to occupy, except when sup ported by the arms of his powerful ally \u2014 a political arrangement which produced no other effect besides supplying Edward with a colour of justice when he treated his prisoners as rebels, rather than as the subjects of an independent country. The sufferings inflicted upon the inhabitants of Lothian in this savage and inglorious expe- During the sufferings occasioned by this calamity neither party was prepared or in clined to renew war, and the truce on its expiry was prolonged for more than a year. At this juncture Philip died in the fifty eighth year of his age (November, 1350), and was succeeded by his son John, duke of Normandy. The new king gladly con sented to renew the truce with England ; and although violated by occasional unim portant rencounters, it was prolonged from time to time during the first five years of his reign. In 1355, however, hostilities once more broke out between the two countries, and Edward, the eldest son of the English king, opened the campaign in the south of France with an army of sixty thousand men, only a small part of whom, however, were English. Marching from Bourdeaux he proceeded as far as the Pyrenees, burning and laying waste.

His troops suffered frightful privations from the want of provisions and forage, and from the inclemency of the weather. Great numbers perished in the retreat, and were cut off by their nimble adversaries; and Edward himself, on one occasion, narrowly escaped being made prisoner. of his necessities, and to restrict, by parliamentary statute, some of those parts of the royal prerogative which were found most inconsistent with the rising spirit of liberty. The nobles did not conceal their conviction that the Great Charter had been violated in several essential points, to the serious loss of his Majesty's subjects; that goods had been seized, and freemen im prisoned without due course of law; and that, therefore, the privileges conceded by King John ought to be confirmed anew, and made the rule of practical government throughout all the branches of the state. It was remarked, in particular, that peers had been arrested, deprived of their estates, thrown into prison, and even put to death without a legal trial ; they therefore enacted that such violent and irregular proceedings should thenceforth cease, and that none of their number should be punished, but in virtue of the sentence of his equals in Parliament. In other respects, also, they touched the king's authority with a bold hand; insisting that he should be obliged to consult his council before silling any of the great offices of the crown; that his ministers should be responsible to Par liament for their conduct ; and that an investigation into their official proceedings should take place every year, on the third day of the session. The exertions of the king in France and Scotland were necessarily attended with a great expenditure; and as commerce was still in a very imperfect condition, there were considerable difficulties to be encountered, not only in raising money, but also in remitting it to foreign countries. The Parliament had voted to Edward twenty thousand sacks of wool; but such a supply could neither be collected nor ren dered available without incurring a very inconvenient delay, during which the debts of the monarch had increased to a great amount. This circumstance may alone account for the bad humour in which he returned to his native country, and the harshness with which he treated some of his principal officers of state, whose remiss ness or want of accuracy he thought himself bound to punish. He likewise involved himself with the clergy, in whose dispositions towards him he found very little to praise. Even the great body of the people, who could not sympathize with his romantic ambition, and who felt the pressure which always attends a protracted war, were disposed to murmur at his demands upon their industry and the flower of their youth, so profusely spent in his foreign expeditions. Edward, yielding to the necessity of his situation, sanctioned these enactments of the peers, and in return received a liberal grant to defray his debts But regarding, at the same time, the concessions he had made as the result of an undutiful attack on the rights of the throne, and as extorted from him under the pressure of circum stances, which deprived him of the power of resistance, he is said to have protested in secret against the hard conditions imposed upon him, and to have declared that he would embrace the first opportunity of revoking all which he had been compelled to relinquish. Nor did he allow much time to elapse before he proceeded to act upon this uncandid resolution. As soon as he An attempt was made to take advantage * Avesbury, p. 235.

Edward, fully impressed with the danger of his position, offered to abandon all his conquests, to release his prisoners, and to bind himself not to serve against France for seven years to come. But John, proudly secure of his prey, rejected these advantageous conditions, and insisted that the prince himself, and one hundred of his chief knights, should surrender as prisoners. had obtained the supply voted by the barons and burgesses, he issued an edict stating that, with the advice of his council, he had abrogated and annulled the statute forced upon his acceptance by the legisla ture. A future Parliament repealed the offensive law, and thereby relieved the sovereign from the heavy imputation of substituting his own will for the decisions of the great national assembly.* In July of the following year, 1356, the Black Prince took the field again at the head of twelve or fourteen thousand men, and renewed his devastating march through the country. He overran the Agenois, the Limousin, and Auvergne, and penetrated into Berri in the very heart of France, spreading terror from the Garonne to the Loire. Bourges and Issoudun successfully resisted his arms, but he took Vierson by storm, and laid siege to Ramorantin. While he was engaged in pressing the capture of this town, which he had vowed not to quit before its surrender, the king of France, who had assembled an army of greatly superior force, advanced from Chartres, and crossing the Loire, at Blois, gained the rear of the English, and effectually intercepted their retreat. It was in vain that the cardinal Talley rand de Perigord and another papal legate urged on one party the certainty of destruc tion, on the other the great benefit of a bloodless triumph. The latter were firm in their resolution to hazard all, rather than concede any portion, however small, of a prize which they fancied already within their grasp ; the former perceived that every chance of freedom, perhaps even of life, was desperate, unless it was established by the sword. The French passed the night before the battle at their ease and abundantly supplied; the English were distressed for provisions, and unable to forage with safety. When the legate, at sunrise (September 19), announced to the Black Prince that his efforts at media tion had failed, Edward replied, \" God help the right ! \" and then addressing a few spirit-stirring words to his comrades, calmly awaited the onset. His position was chosen on the field of Maupertuis, near Beaumont, about two leagues north from Poictiers.* It was naturally strong, amid vineyards and bushes ; two days had been employed in throwing up hasty works, and it could be approached only by a narrow lane, not admitting more than four horsemen abreast. Having lined the hedges on either side of this road with archers, Edward drew up his main body at its extremity in a hearse, or double square, with archers in front. Him self and his principal knights were on foot, but their horses were placed hard by in case On the capture of Ramorantin, Prince Edward, in utter ignorance of his danger, turned to the south-west, and marched for Poictiers, in the vicinity of which, unknown to him, the enemy lay. In the French camp were mustered six and twenty great feudatories, bearing the titles of duke or count ; more than one hundred and twenty bannerets, together with four youthful sons of the king ; and this bril liant array of leaders was followed by sixty thousand combatants, nearly half of whom were men-at-arms. The Black Prince, on the other hand, could not now bring into the field quite eight thousand men, and a fourth of these were light-armed and irreg ular troops. He was, indeed, altogether at bay: to decline battle, if his enemy should press it, was impossible; and the terms * Sismondi, vol x. p. 461. Walckenaer states that the field of battle is supposed to be between the village of Beau vois and the abbey of Noaille to the south-east of Poictiers. * Rymer, vol. v., p. 283."], [335, "A.d. 1356.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 297 of necessity. On a rising ground to the right of the main battle, were posted three hundred men-at-arms and an equal number of mounted archers, so disposed as to be concealed from the enemy, and to be pre pared for a movement in flank. defended himself with a battle-axe, and did marvels in arms. His danger was indeed great, for every foe was eager to capture so illustrious a prisoner; and each moment of combat diminished the little troop of faith ful nobles which interposed between their sovereign and the conquerors. \" Where is my cousin the prince of Wales?\" inquired the king of a knight wdio called upon him to yield, after both he and his son had been wounded ;* and when informed that Edward was in another part of the field, but that he should be led to him forth with, after satisfying himself as to the quality of his enemy, he presented his right gauntlet in token of surrender. Sir Denis de Morbecque of Artois was the fortunate captor. He bad been outlawed many years before in consequence of a youthful brawl, in which be had killed his opponent, and since that time he had continued in the Eng lish service. Three hundred picked men-at-arms, the flower of the French cavalry, led the van, with orders to break through the English archers posted in front. They were per mitted to enter the lane unmolested, and not untd they were fully entangled within it did the cross volleys from each boundary hedge announce the presence of an enemy. The wounded horses becoming ungovern able, either threw their riders \u2014 wrho, en cumbered by heavy armour, were speedily dispatched by the light troops of the Eng lish \u2014 or rushing back upon the second division, which was advancing under the command of the dauphin, threw it into inextricable confusion. At this moment, the English cavalry stationed on the hill increased the panic by a seasonable charge in flank ; and the prince of Wales and his men-at-arms, leaping upon their horses, followed up the first advantage, and endeavoured to penetrate to the king's own station. \" Then was there a sore battle and a perilous, and many a man was overthrown; and he that was down could not be relieved without great succour and aid.\" A large body of the French second division, to whom the especial custody of the princes Louis and John had been in trusted, became embarrassed by the presence of the royal striplings, who, devoid of courage, and forgetful of the duty of their high birth, thought only of safety. As the English approached, they took to flight, and with them fled more than eight hundred spears, which struck no stroke that day. The king himself fought bravely on foot, accompanied by his youngest son Philip, at that time scarcely thirteen years of age ; and had they been supported but by a fourth part of their host with valour equal to their own, the day might have terminated in their favour. As the press drew nearer, John The battle, which commenced at dawn, was closed by noon ; the French were pur sued under the walls of Poictiers, and when the citizens equally excluded both friend and foe, we are told there was horrible butchery before their gates. By nightfall the prisoners brought into the English host, together with the king of France and his son, amounted to seventeen counts, exclusive of barons, knights, and squires ;f \"so that every man had twice as many prisoners as they were in number in all.\" Security and convenience prompted the immediate release of many of these captives, who were ransomed incontinently on the field. Nevertheless, although the English were found right courteous in the terms which they accepted, there was not a man who served in their ranks who did not enrich himself with honour and goods, either by the price of redemption, or by the winning * In the charter by which the duchy of Burgundy was granted to Philip in 1363, John mentions the wound which his son had received at Poictiers as one reason for granting him this reward. f Froissart, vol. i. c. clxvi.

The battle of Poictiers added to the fame of English arms, by the captivity of another monarch. John, after displaying much personal valour, was taken prisoner in the field. The modest behaviour of the Black Prince on this occasion has been highly extolled, though it forms a striking contrast to his cruel revenge on the inhabitants of Limoges, of whom he slew three thousand men, women, and children, merely because they had dared to defend their liberty. In the spring of the following year, a truce, into which he had entered with the dauphin, permitted him to return to England, whither he conducted the king of France.* of gold, silver, or jewels. As for rich har ness, it was so plentiful as to be wholly dis regarded. Eight thousand of the vanquished were left upon the field, among whom were the duke of Bourbon, the duke of Athens, Walter de Brienne, constable of France, and fifty other distinguished nobles ; three thou sand more fell in the pursuit. The loss of the English, although greatly inferior, was still heavy, and testified how fiercely the battle had been contested. Their killed amounted to nine hundred men-at-arms, and fifteen hundred archers. In relating the deeds ofCrecy and Poictiers, an Englishman may be forgiven if he lingers upon his narrative. They form a distin guished portion of our great stock of national glory, and to this day the words themselves are not pronounced without emotion, even by those least acquainted with historical details. Yet it is from the incidents which succeeded his brilliant victory that the war rior, whose name is known as a household word in our annals, has derived a brighter and a purer fame than any warlike conquest can bestow. Other heroes have gathered laurels scarcely less profuse than those which adorned Edward's brows ; none has ever worn them with equal gracefulness. He enter tained his prisoners with as goodly cheer as the rudeness of a military banquet after a battle would permit. He served the king of France in person at the chief table, pro testing that he was ' not sufficient ' to sit at the same board. He encouraged him with assurances of his father's good will and amity, and he consoled him for the reverse of the day by according to him individually ' the high renown of prowess,' and declaring, in a tone of the most earnest sincerity, that every one who had witnessed his deeds must ' accord by that sentence to give him the prize and chaplet.' Well might the French men who were present \" begin to murmur, and to say among themselves, how the prince had spoken nobly, and that by all estimation he should prove a noble man if God send him life, and to persevere in such good fortune.\"* Having landed at Sandwich, he proceeded leisurely towards London, where splendid preparations were made for his reception; which, though announced as intended to do honour to his royal charge, who entered the capital together with him, were really meant to illustrate his triumph over a rival nation. The citizens displayed their wealth and loyalty in the most ostentatious manner. More than a thousand of them, arrayed in gaudy robes, and headed by the lord mayor, proceeded under the colours of their respec tive companies to meet the prince of Wales in Southwark. The conqueror had mounted a small horse, plainly caparisoned, while he conferred upon the French sovereign a beautiful charger, distinguished by magnifi cent trappings. When the pageant reached Westminster Hall, in which a sumptuous entertainment was made ready, Edward appeared seated on his throne, surrounded by his barons and the dignitaries of the church. He stepped forward to meet the august captive, and conducted him to the table; but no degree of attention bestowed upon the stranger could diminish the affectionate regard with which the assem bled nobles received the son of their king, or could withdraw the eyes of the spectators from the hero whose fame had already eclipsed the most brilliant deeds of his ancestors.! * Froissart, book liv. e. 162. t Rymer, vol. vi. p. 3, 45.

It became, therefore, an object with Edward to negotiate a ran som with the subjects of both princes, more especially as he now clearly perceived that, though he could gain battles and lay waste whole provinces, he could not conquer the hearts of those over whom he wished to rule, nor establish a lasting sovereignty either in Scotland or France. But he found that the price which he set on the freedom of the monarchs was higher than their respective countries were able or will ing to advance. The Scots in particular were poor; and regarding David as possessing neither great talents nor good fortune, they were less desirous for his restoration. There is reason to suspect that the impatience of the Scottish king for his release from cap tivity, made him willing to surrender the hard- won independence of his kingdom; and there are two documents still in exist ence in which he acknowledges the English king as his lord paramount, and agrees to take the oath of allegiance to him. David was permitted at this time to revisit his own dominions upon parole, and on giving seven young nobles as hostages for his return,* and there is good reason to believe that this temporary liberation was conceded to him mainly for the purpose of promoting the designs of Edward upon the Scottish throne. But David soon discovered that his people were unanimously resolved that they would never consent, for any consideration, to barter the independence of their country. t The Scottish king had therefore no alter native but to return very reluctantly to his captivity in England. in nine years; but before the treaty was ratified, the Scots were persuaded by the representations of a deputy from the French court to break it off, and to renew the war with England as soon as the truce expired.* These various negotiations for the ransom and liberation of the captive monarch were protracted over a period of ten years. But at length, after the failure of the formidable invasion of Scotland which Edward under took in 1356, he seems to have become con vinced that it was hopeless to expect to establish his supremacy over the country by force, and that other means must be tried to gain his end. He therefore became anxious to conclude a peace between the two kingdoms, and to restore David to liberty, relying on his co-operation in pro moting his ambitious designs. It was accordingly arranged that commissioners from the two kingdoms should meet at Berwick on the 3rd of October, 1357, for the final settlement of the treaty. The ransom of the king was ultimately fixed at one hundred thousand pounds, equivalent to twelve hundred thousand pounds ster ling of modern money \u2014 a most exorbitant sum \u2014 to be paid by annual instalments of two thousand marks. A truce was at the same time concluded between the two kingdoms for ten years, and hostages were given for the payment of the ransom which Edward was well aware must press heavily on the scanty resources of a country drained by a long and destructive war. In the month of November David re turned to his own country, from which he had been absent eleven years, and was most enthusiastically welcomed by his subjects. But it soon became evident that David's character had not improved during his lengthened captivity in England. He had grown more self-indulgent and fond of pleasure than ever, and, his weak mind yielding to the influence of the English king, he had suffered himself to be made an accomplice in the designs of that mon arch on the independence of Scotland. Several abortive negotiations were entered into by the Scots for the purpose of obtain ing the freedom of their king. A treaty was even agreed to in July, 1354, in which David's ransom was fixed at the enormous sum of ninety thousand marks, to be paid * Rymer, Feed vol. v pp. 7 24, 727. f Knyghton, p. 2603.

Edward on his part craftily encouraged the intercourse which at this time grew up between the two countries, flattered and caressed the Scottish nobles, bestowed upon them rich gifts, and strove by every means in his power to ingratiate himself with them and with the people. Commissioners were from time to time despatched to the English court with the ostensible object of maintaining friendly relations with England, but they were in reality intended to advance the schemes of Edward for the union of the crowns ; and David who had long been child less, and cherished a dislike to the High Steward, the heir to the throne willingly lent himself to promote this subtle policy. The difficulty experienced in raising the money to pay the king's ransom; the con clusion of the treaty of Bretigny between France and England, by which the French court basely renounced their alliance with Scotland ; and the straits to which the coun try was reduced by a dreadful inundation in Lothian, which caused a frightful sacrifice of life and property, and by a pestilence which swept away great multitudes of the nobles as well as of the people \u2014 reduced the kingdom to the greatest straits, and seemed to afford a favourable opportunity for making public the plot which for years had been maturing against the independence of Scotland. Accordingly in a Parliament held at Scone in the year 1363, David pro posed to the Estates that in the event of his death without issue, they should settle the crown on Prince Lionel, the third son of the English monarch, and dilated on the great advantages which would accrue to Scotland from this step. But the proposal was received with a burst of indignation by the Estates, and they instantly and unani mously exclaimed, \" We will never permit an Englishman to reign over us.\" throne, and a civil war seemed imminent. But through the mediation of friends this danger was averted, the Steward and his associates laid down their arms, and in return his title to the succession was fullv recognized by the king and Parliament. * David, however, had not laid aside his unworthy scheme for the subordination of his kingdom to the supremacy of England, and as the debt owing for his ransom was still unpaid, it was hoped that the people would be willing to relieve themselves from the burden by the sacrifice of their inde pendence. Every inducement was held out to the nobility and the mercantile classes to regard with favour the English rule. The latter commenced a lucrative trade with England, and merchants from all the towns and royal burghs of Scotland were in the habit of visiting the southern kingdom for the purposes of trade, where they received a most friendly welcome. The Scottish youths were encouraged to frequent the uni versities of Oxford and Cambridge, facilities were afforded to those who were disposed to make pilgrimages to the English shrines, and important privileges were bestowed on the monasteries and other religious houses which acknowledged the English authority. Relying on the effect produced by this wily policy, David on his visit to London in the autumn of 1363, once more in volved himself in secret negotiations with the king of England, and entered into an agreement by which Edward himself was to be declared heir to the Scottish throne. The conditions annexed to this agreement, twenty-seven in number, were drawn up with great art, and no effort was spared to gain the good will of all classes of the Scottish people. Provisions were inserted which seemed most likely to conciliate not only the nobles, but the clergy, the mer chants and burgesses, the military tenants, and even the common people, and to induce them to acquiesce cheerfully in the rule of the English monarch. f By the last article David was deeply mortified at this result, but he found it prudent to repress his feel ings, and made no reply. All confidence, however, between him and his people was destroyed. The Steward and his allies took up arms to assert his rights as heir to the * Fordun, book xiv. c. 25, 27. f Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. vi. p. 427."], [339, "a.d. 1357-1358.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 301 of the agreement David bound himself to sound the inclinations of his people regard ing this scheme, and to acquaint the English king and council with the result fifteen days after Easter. But as the proposal was never submitted to the Scottish parliament, there can be little doubt that David on his return home found the hostility of his subjects to any such scheme altogether insuperable. without the usual acknowledgment of vas salage. To such terms, though the king himself might have been induced to accede, the French people turned an indignant car; resolving rather to incur the risk of a new war, than to purchase a temporary repose by sacrificing the honour of their native land. Two papal legates followed the French king and the prince of Wales to London, where they made strenuous efforts to bring about a peace between England and France. Edward expressed his willingness to relin quish his claims on the French crown, but demanded an enormous sum as the price of John's freedom, besides the restoration of Normandy, of the heritage of Queen Eleanor, and of all the provinces which had belonged to Henry II., to be held in complete sove reignty, without any feudal dependence on the French king. John naturally hesitated to give his consent to these hard terms, but delay only increased the wretchedness or weakness of his kingdom, which meantime was a prey to the most frightful internal convulsions. There was a bitter feud between the dauphin and the king of Navarre, who was in close alliance with the citizens of Paris, and was suspected of designs upon the throne. On the 22d of February, 1358, Stephen Marcel, the provost of the merchants, forced the palace gates at the head of a fierce mob, wearing hoods of red and blue colours, and killed two of the dauphin's counsellors, Robert de Clermont and John de Conflans, so near that prince, that his robes were sprinkled with their blood . The Cardinal De la Forest, chancellor and chief minister, was at the same time forced to resign his office and flee for his life, and the dauphin himself was with difficulty rescued from the fury of the rabble by Marcel their leader. The conduct of David during the remain der of his unhappy reign served still more to alienate the affections of his people. He married for his second wife a young woman of great beauty but inferior birth \u2014 a step which gave deep offence to his haughty nobles; and through her influence he cast the Steward and his son into prison. He and his new queen made frequent and ex pensive visits to the English court, utterly regardless of the deep distresses of his king dom, and the great difficulty his people felt in raising by burdensome taxation the debt stid due for his ransom. He squandered in frivolous and expensive amusements the money wrung from his subjects, and in curred besides a large amount of debt. He ultimately quarrelled with his queen, and obtained a sentence of divorce, which was pronounced by the Scottish bishops in Lent, (1369).* He died a few months later (22nd February, 1370), in tbe forty-seventh year of his age, f regretted by none; and indeed, melancholy as the thought is, there can be little doubt that the death of the only son of Robert Bruce must have been regarded by his subjects as a national deliverance. There was still greater difficulty in accom plishing the redemption of the French king, though the pope lent his aid in forming the basis of an arrangement between the contract ing powers. Edward, besides demanding an enormous sum for the ransom of the other prisoners of rank, required, as a compensa tion for renouncing his claim to the crown of France, the entire possession of all the provinces in that country which had be longed to his ancestors, to be holden by him At this critical period, open war broke out between the peasants and the nobles. The peasants throughout the kingdom, and especially in the Isle of France, had been grievous sufferers since the defeat at Poictiers, in consequence of the more than ordinary exactions wrung from them to provide the * Fordun, book xiv. o. 34. f Ibid."], [340, "302 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1357-1358. ransoms of their masters. \" Jacques Bon homme,\" said the captive feudal lords, \"will pay for all ;\" and hence was organized, under the name of La Jacquerie, one of the most savage and fearful insurrections which has ever armed the lower orders in any state against their superiors. It can little surprise us to find that a class, which had never yet been admitted to share the full privileges of manhood, now showed itself devoid of all human charities ; and while we shudder over the enormities produced by brutal ignorance, by a rabid thirst for indiscrimi nate vengeance, and by desperation resulting from consciousness that no place was left for pardon, it must never be forgotten that the evil passions which desolated France had been stung to madness by the pride and the tyranny, the profusion or the avarice, of those who ought to have directed them selves to their correction and guidance. \" Thus began,\" as Froissart simply yet forcibly expresses himself, \" a marvellous tribulation ; and certain people of the com mon villages said all with one voice, shame have he that doth not use his power to destroy all the gentlemen of the realm.\" Armed with only staves and knives, and at first in small numbers, they commenced their work of revolution. As their hun dreds swelled to thousands, lust, murder, and rapine followed in their steps. \" I dare not write the horrible deeds that they did,\" continues the same author ; \" no human creature ought to think on such, and he that did most mischief was most praised with them, and greatest master.\" The few details which he proceeds to offer are too horrible for transcription. Every gentle man whom the peasants captured was put to death after unspeakable torture ; more than one hundred castles were sacked and burned between Paris and Soissons ; and the rebels, choosing from their ranks a leader best adapted to their habits, \" the most ungracious of all others,\" paid homage at his feet, and saluted him as \"Le Roy Jacques Bonhomme.\" the greater part of 1357 and 1358, and was not suppressed without equal atrocities on the part of the government and the nobles. On one occasion upwards of twenty thou sand peasants were put to death by the dauphin. The king of Navarre put three thousand to the sword at one time. Among the nobles, the Sire de Couci was con spicuous for the cruelties he inflicted on these miserable serfs in Picardy and Artois. They were cut down in heaps, crushed to death, and slaughtered like beasts. No quarter was given, and no prisoners taken, except a few hundred who were reserved to furnish a public exhibition, and to be put to death by the most horrible tortures. Meanwhile John, wearied of his captivity, and his spirit broken by tidings of the sufferings undergone by his subjects, signed a treaty dictated by the English monarch. But when it was sent over to Paris for the ratification of the dauphin, it excited uni versal astonishment and indignation. As the price of his freedom, he consented to an ignominious partition of his dominions ; and besides the payment of four million crowns of gold as a ransom, he ceded to Edward, not in vassalage, but in independent sove reignty, some of the fairest provinces of France, including Normandy, Guienne, Maine, and Brittany, and several important towns. The regent, as Charles had already been named, convoked another meeting of the states-general, in which the deputies unanimously rejected the proposed terms, protesting that they would endure a thou sand-fold more evil than they had already suffered, and permit their king to die in prison, rather than dishonour themselves by so \" minishing the realm.\" John attributed this refusal to the in fluence of the king of Navarre, who, he said, was crafty enough to delude sixty such as the dauphin. On the other hand, the king of England, suspecting that his prisoner had acted with duplicity and had secretly procured the disavowal of the peace, imposed more restraint upon his person, and transferred him first to Hert- This horrible Jacquerie continued during"], [341, "a.d. 1360.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 303 ford, afterwards to Somerton, and eventually to the Tower of London. Preparations were made at the same time for a speedy and vigorous renewal of war, and Edward confidently boasted that ere winter should be past he wrould enter France puissantly, and abide there till he had made peace at his pleasure. which reminded him of the day of judgment, that completely subdued his resolution. \" Looking towards the church of Notre- Dame at Chartres, he took a vow ; and he afterwards went devoutly to that church, confessed himself, and promised that he would grant a peace, and then he went to lodge at a village near to Chartres, called Bretigny.\" * The regent was languid in opposition ; and satisfied while he could retain possession of his capital, he permitted one division of the invaders, accompanied by a formidable band of \" Free Companions,\" to overrun Picardy, and afterwards remained motion- less, while Edward himself, desirous to provoke a battle, wasted Champagne and Burgundy. The king of Navarre, also, who was again in arms, made \"sore war\" in the marches of Normandy. Even when the English were encamped at Bourg la Reine, within two leagues of Paris, Charles declined their formal challenge ; and Edward, finding Paris too well garrisoned to permit the hope of successful assault, had already designed to occupy Brittany during the summer months, and to return in autumn to the investment of the capital, when the sage counsel of \" disercat per- sons \" on either side produced an unexpected peace. Little persuasion could be necessary to induce the dauphin to listen to accom- modation, for his \" realm was in poor estate, and likely to be in still greater jeopardy.\" The difficulty was chiefly with Edward, who \"was hard-hearted to agree thereunto, for his intention was to be king of France, and to die in that estate.\" But the duke of Lancaster wisely represented that there was now an opportunity of terminating a war with honour and prosit, which might otherwise endure during the remainder of his life ; and that from the uncertainty of the field he might on some occasion lose more in one day than he had won in twenty years. These reasons, no doubt, had great weight with the English monarch ; but Froissart states that it was a terrific tempest of thunder, lightning, wind, had, and rain, which he encountered near Chartres, and An armistice was accordingly agreed on, and on the 8th of May, 1360, peace was con cluded by the important treaty of Bretigny. By the terms, which were settled after a week's discussion, \" the king of England, lord of Ireland and of Aquitaine,\" as Edward was now content to style himself, formally renounced his pretensions to the crown of France, and his claim to Normandy, Anjou, and Maine, with some other territories that had belonged to his ancestors, and in lieu thereof accepted Guienne and Poictou, with their dependencies Saintonge, Agenois, the Limousin, Perigord, Thouars, and other districts in the south, and the county of Ponthieu in the north-west, the inheritance of his mother. He also retained Calais and Guisnes, and the viscounty of Montreuil. The ransom of the French king was fixed at three million crowns of gold, six hundred thousand of which was to be paid within four months, and before the king should be allowed to quit Calais; the remainder in annual portions of four hundred thousand crowns each for the next six years. During the campaign that terminated in the peace of Bretigny, the inhabitants of the southern shores of England were alarmed by the appearance of a French fleet, which entered the Channel and committed serious depredations on every species of property within their reach. The town of AVinchel sea was taken and plundered, under circum stances of such barbarity as excited the utmost indignation and terror. Troops were collected for the defence of the coast; merchant ships were everywhere seized for * Froissart, vol. i. c. ccxii.; ICnyghton, p. 2624. \" Rarely,\" says Voltaire, \" does a storm determine the decision of the conquerors or the destiny of states.\" \u2014 Sur les Maori, ii. 132."], [342, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

A fleet of eighty sail, having on board fourteen thousand sol diers, was soon ready for sea, which drove the invaders towards their own ports, and inflicted on their countrymen a smart retaliation.* The impoverished and distracted state of the country made it impossible for John to raise the money to pay his heavy ransom, while the violent opposition of the nobles and people prevented renunciation of the supremacy of the crown over the provinces ceded to England. He was sensitive on the point of honour; tradition has ascribed to him the saying, \" When faith and virtue are banished from all the rest of the world, they ought to find a refuge in the bosom of kings ;\" and he was deeply mortified at his inability to fulfil his engagements. This feeling was aggravated by the conduct of his son, the duke of Anjou, who was one of the hostages for the payment of his father's ransom. Notwithstanding of the generous treatment by which he was allowed to reside in France, on condition that he should present himself on every fourth day before the authorities of Calais, the duke broke his parole, and betook himself to the capital. John's chivalrous spirit revolted at this breach of faith, and he resolved to make it good by presenting himself personally in England. Against the remonstrances of his council, urged, as it appears, with no slight vehemence and importunity, he maintained his resolu tion with unbroken firmness, returning but one answer, which is honourable alike to Edward and to himself, \" Sirs, I have found in the king of England, my brother, in the queen and their children, so much truth and honour that I cannot praise them too much; wherefore I doubt nothing of them but that they will be to me right courteous and true friends in all cases. Also I will excuse my son, the duke of Anjou, of his returning into France.\"* The sum requisite for the first payment, upon which King John's liberty depended, was contributed by Giovanni Galeazzo, lord of Milan, in return for the hand of Isabella, daughter of the French king. Having discharged this instalment of his ransom, and delivered hostages for the payment of the remainder, John returned to a kingdom barassedbyinnumerable calamities. Foreign war and civil disunion had exhausted the finances, and destroyed both the agricul- ture and manufactures upon which their reparation mainly depended, and peace itself was not restored without a curse, which almost counterbalanced the blessing. The troops discharged from both the French and English service \u2014 a motley refuse of desperate spirits, whose hand was against every man, \" Germans, Brabanters, Flemings, Hainaulters, and Gascons, great pillers and robbers, who said they must needs live \" \u2014 swelled the numerous bands of \" adven- turers,\" whose trade was rapine ; and we read, among others, of Ba Grand Com pagnk, Ba Blanche Compagnie, the Tards- venus, the Malaudins, and the Routiers, whose very names excited not less terror during their existence than that of the Buccaneers spread over the New World at a later period. Innocent VI. preached an ineffectual crusade against these brigands, when he trembled at their approach to Avignon ; but it was only by their engagement in the Lombard wars, which transferred many of them to Italy, that France, which they affected to call leur chambre, obtained even partial relief from their absence. Pesti- lence, resulting from the scarcity of food, necessarily produced by the interruption of On his disembarkation at Dover with a brilliant train, John was received with dis- * Rymer. vol. vi. p. 167. \" Froissart, vol. i. cccxvi:i."], [343, "a.d. 1364.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 305 tinguished honour. He paid his devotions and offered a rich jewel at the shrine of a Becket in Canterbury, and proceeded by slow journeys to Edward's court at Eltham, where on his arrival was \" great dancing and carolling.\" The Savoy in London was again ordained for his lodgings, and there divers times were celebrated great feasts, suppers, and other pastimes. Also, \"whenever it pleased the French king, he went to the king's palace of Westmin ster secretly by the river Thames.\"* But these festivities were cut short by the dangerous illness of John. He \" lay sore sick,\" says Froissart, \" at his lodging at the Savoy in London, and every day he impaired worse and worse, the which greatly dis pleased the king of England and the queen, for all his physicians said he was in great peril.\" At length he expired (April, 1364), much to the regret of all in England, \"who were right heavy and sorry, for the great honour and love that the king had to him ever since the peace was made between them.\"t that the royal supplicant had arrived at Bayonne and was then on his way to Bour deaux, he left the city with a splendid escort to receive him. After a series of festive hospitalities on a scale of magnificence adapted to the rank of the distinguished guest, he was invited to urge his suit before the states of Aquitaine, which had been expressly convoked for the occasion. The knights were not insensible to his argu ments, especially when he undertook to place large treasures at their disposal; but they cautiously refused to decide till they had received the instructions of the English king. The sanction of Edward III. was easily obtained, and the barons, after a hesitation probably affected with a view to raise the price of their assistance, yielded their assent. Peter stipulated to pay five hundred and fifty thousand florins of gold to the Companies for their services, and a further sum of fifty-six thousand to Edward, besides investing him with the lordship of Biscay. Shortly after the conclusion of peace be tween France and England, Pedro IV., surnamed \" the Cruel,\" was driven from his throne by his illegitimate half-brother, Don Henry, count of Trastamara, and fled through Portugal to Corunna, where he embarked with his daughters for Bourdeaux. Among his many recent atrocities Pedro had poisoned his wife, the sister-in-law of Charles V., the young king of France. Charles in conse quence had espoused the cause of Henry, and had given him, besides some pecuniary assistance, permission to raise a powerful force among the Free Companies, whose presence in France had added largely to the troubles of the kingdom. The celebrated warrior Bertrand du Guesclin had accom panied the expedition into Spain, and had contributed greatly to its success. In his extremity, Pedro resolved to throw himself upon the hospitality of the Black Prince, who was at this time residing at Bourdeaux, and to implore his assistance in the recovery of his crown. When Edward was informed To insure the performance of these con ditions, Peter placed two of his daughters as hostages in the hands of the English chief. The alliance of this brave and generous prince with the most repulsive character of his age has been deemed a blemish upon his memory, and on more than one occasion has been made a subject of mournful reproach. But the morality of these times was not over nice. Nor may we overlook a reason which would interest the English particularly in his fate ; his adversary was indebted to French assistance for his successful usurpation, and national rivalry would suggest, and policy would confirm, the propriety of securing to England the influence in Castile which was now monopolized by France. During the conduct of these negotiations Don Henry had been acknowledged through out Andalusia, and having found at Seville a large treasure, he liberally recompensed bis mercenaries and dismissed them, reserving only the personal followers of Du Guesclin, and other French and English knights. This has been considered an imprudent step, * Froissart, vol. i. c. rcxix. f I'L 39"], [344, "306 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1367. done as it was in the face of Edward's pro jected invasion, but it should be remembered that the presence of these mercenaries must have been exceedingly onerous ; accustomed to rapine and violence, the very hospitality which they received oppressed them, and they sighed for pillage and the spoils of war after the excitement of an obstinate re sistance. Henry now invaded Galicia, and attacked Fernando de Castro, who had been charged with the care of that province ; but compelled by the exigency of his affairs at Castile to raise the siege, he retired, after making a convention with De Castro, by which the latter bound himself to deliver up his fortress at Christmas, if he were not relieved before that time. From Lago he proceeded to Burgos, held there an assembly of the States, and received the requisite sup plies. A great object between the contending parties was, on the one hand, to obtain a passage through Navarre, and, on the other, to prevent it. The king of that country was accordingly solicited by repeated nego tiations. He took everything that was offered, and promised everything that was asked, bound himself by a solemn oath to refuse a passage through his territory to the English, and then concerted a plan with Oliver de Manny, in virtue of which he was to be made prisoner and carried into Normandy, in order that, without his apparent consent, the passage might be effected. The Black Prince, with a mixed force of English, Nor mans, and Gascons, entered Navarre by Roncevaux, and, passing through it, pro ceeded to Logrono. His next position was Navarre, and as Henry had advanced to Najera, the contest could not long be de ferred. A courteous letter from Edward explained the nature of his interference, and invited Henry to an amicable adjustment of the quarrel; an equally courteous reply pleaded the despotism of Peter as a justi- fication of his expulsion, and declined any other arbitration than an appeal to arms. It was the advice of Du Guesclin that a battle should be avoided; an opinion sug- gested not only by the military skill and intrepidity of the English leader, and the excellent composition of his army, but also by the policy of drawing it deeper into the interior, exposing it to a climate to which the troops were entirely unaccustomed, and waiting for the moment when their physical energies should be enfeebled by exhaustion and fatigue. On the other hand, the Cas tilian nobles insisted that retreat would be the signal for a general revolt, and urged the necessity of an immediate battle. With our imperfect knowledge of the circumstances it is impossible to say which of these opinions was the better founded; but the latter seems to indicate that the choice of the people inclined to Pedro, unless we suppose that, indifferent to both competitors, they reserved their fidelity for the strongest. The dawn of the 3rd of April, 1367, had scarcely broken when the two armies, com manded by leaders of renown, and thronged with the most valiant gentlemen of England and France, were marshalled in their order of attack, and the first beams of the morning sun glanced from the brilliant armour of the knights as they were gallantly advancing to the charge. The conflict was for some time fiercely sustained ; the slings of the Spaniards gave \" a mighty trouble to the English at first, but when they also felt the sharp arrows of England light upon them they could not keep their array.\" At last Don Tello, who commanded a large body of cavalry on the left of the Castilian army, panic-stricken at the desperate onset of the English prince, set the example of a disgraceful flight. The centre of the army being thus exposed was speedily attacked, and, in spite of the noble efforts of Du Guesclin and his knights, was completely and irrecoverably broken. The valour of Henry was conspicuous while the slightest chance of retrieval remained, and he had hardly time to escape from the bloody field with a scanty retinue. By this splendid victory the outcast was reseated on his throne, and the crown which he had abandoned without a straggle was, by the courage and conduct of his ally, recovered at a single blow. As the object of the expedition had"], [345, "A.d. 1367. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 307 been completely effected, Edward demanded the stipulated compensation for the services of his army and himself. The mean and heartless king, whom policy should have taught to be munificent, urged his position as an excuse for deferring the promised pay, and pleaded the opposition of the Biscayans (which he himself had instigated) to the transfer of their province to a foreigner, as a reason for not immediately conferring its seigniory on the English prince. If these excuses were insincere they wrere at least plausible, and Edward consented to remain at Valladolid till the king should reach Sevdle, whence he solemnly promised to remit a sum to discharge the most pressing part of his obligations. The money, how ever, never came, or came but scantily; and as the climate had now begun to exert a fatal influence on the English army, which was rapidly wasting with disease, Edward, mor tified and deceived, broken in health and spirits, after making peace with Arragon, and exacting twenty fortresses from the Castilian king as a security for the performance of his engagements, withdrew with his army into Guienne (July, 1367). reasonably hope to effect his object through the promises already obtained from Henry, than through any negotiations which he might make with the reigning king. The Castilian king, thus deprived by his own folly of that arm which might have saved, as it once restored his crown, was soon after defeated and killed by his brother Henry, who took immediate possession of the vacant throne. Meanwhile the French king had been watching with a wary eye the unwise proceedings of the English, in wasting their strength and money in these foreign expedi tions. He entered into a treaty with Henry, whose throne was now secure, and bound him to assist in the expulsion of the English from France. Means were at the same time taken to conciliate the king of Navarre, and a secret understanding was entered into with certain disaffected barons, vassals of the Black Prince, whose lands lay near the Pyrenees. The expedition into Castile had so embarrassed that prince that he was obliged to impose additional taxes upon his subjects of Guienne, in order to obtain the means of paying his troops. Upon this, several of the lords who had been gained over by the French court went to Paris, and appealed to the king, as lord paramount, against this oppressive taxation. By the treaty of Bretigny the province had been ceded to Edward in absolute sovereignty; but disregarding this stipulation, Charles summoned the Black Prince as his vassal to appear before his court at Paris to answer the complaints made against him by his Gascon lords. Edward replied that he would, indeed, march to Paris, but that it should be at the head of sixty thousand men. His father, however, who knew the difficulties of raising money in England, offered to content him self with the separate sovereignty of Guienne and Poictou with the adjoining provinces, which he actually possessed. The French monarch, however, regarding this moderation as a proof of weakness, declared the Black Prince contumacious, and poured his troops into his territories. Edward, on his part, The bad faith of Pedro towards the Black Prince soon produced its appropriate fruits. Edward, no longer anxious to be the champion of a perjured monarch, and de- sirous only to indemnify himself for the expenses of the former expedition, invited the kings of Arragon and Navarre to send commissioners to Tarbes, who might confer with his own, and determine which of the two competitors it would be most expedient to assist. The result of the conference was that the preference should be given to Pedro, provided he would undertake to discharge the engagements he had contracted, other- wise their assistance would be tendered on equivalent conditions to Henry. But these selfish arrangements never took effect. Ed- ward was evidently reluctant to expose him- self to a renewal of expenses and vexations similar to those which he had already suffered, and the king of Arragon, whose great desire was to get possession of Murcia, might more"], [346, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The duke marched through the north western provinces, laying waste the country; but the French king cautiously avoided a battle. The dukes of Anjou and Berri, at the head of considerable forces, marched from opposite points against the Black Prince, who, though labouring under a mortal illness, roused himself and took the field against them; but the royal dukes durst not wait the approach of their dreaded adversary. They retreated with great pre cipitation, and disbanded their forces. they were veritable martyrs.\" The knights, about eighty in number, to whom the dukes of Anjou and Berri had entrusted the defence of Limoges, retreated to one of the squares, and placing their backs against an old wall, made a desperate resis tance against overwhelming numbers of assailants. The Black Prince, struck with admiration of their gallantry, gave orders that their lives should be spared ; but no mercy was shown to any of the common people, and the city itself, after being plun dered, was burned to the ground. The bishop. who was the real offender, escaped through the management of the duke of Lancaster. After this merciless butchery the Black Prince returned to England, hoping that the air of his native country might restore his impaired health. The last military exploit of the Black Prince was the capture of Limoges, the capital of the Limousin, which had been betrayed to the French by the bishop and the citizens. The prince was the more indig nant at their treachery as he had conferred many benefits on the town, and therefore relied on the gratitude of its inhabitants. He swore by the soul of his father that he would not move or attend to any other matter until he had recovered the town, and that he would make the traitors pay dear for their perfidy. His illness had increased to such an extent that he was unable to mount his horse, but he caused himself to be carried on a litter from post to post, and he pressed the siege with a savage fury quite unusual with him. After the siege had lasted a month, a breach was made in the walls, it is supposed by the explosion of gunpowder ; and the besiegers, pouring through the breach, commenced an indis criminate massacre of the inhabitants. Men, women, and children threw themselves on their knees before the prince, crying \"Mercy, mercy!\" but he would not hear them, though, as Froissart remarks, the poor and humble class of citizens could have had nothing to do with the betraying of the town to the French. Upwards of three thousand were put to death in this merciless and wicked slaughter. \" God have mercy on their souls,\" says the chronicler, \" for Soon after his departure, his brother, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, to whom he had entrusted the command of Guienne, assumed in right of his wife Constance, eldest daughter of Pedro the Cruel, the arms and title of King of Castile and Leon. This imprudent step increased the difficulties of the English army in France, by inducing Henry, brother of Pedro, who was now firmly seated on his throne, to draw still closer the bonds of his alliance with France. In the month of June, 1372, the earl of Pembroke, who had been despatched with a fleet to the assistance of the duke of Lancaster, was attacked off Rochelle by a Spanish fleet much more powerful than his own, and after a fierce conflict, which lasted the entire day, was defeated and taken prisoner. The whole of his ships were either captured or destroyed, and one of those which sank had on board the military chest with twenty thousand pounds in it. This was a heavy blow to the English, and from this time forward the tide of success set in decidedly against them: fortress after for tress fell into the hands of the French king, who, cautiously avoiding a general action in the field, gradually but steadily cleared the country of the enemy. Sir Robert Knolles swept the whole of the"], [347, "a.d. 1374-1376.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 309 northern provinces from Calais to the walls of Paris, which he insulted, while the duke of Lancaster marched through France from the one end to the other without meeting any opposition. But all the important fortresses and towns were so well guarded that they could make no impression on them, or retain any permanent hold of the country, while they lost many of their men from fatigue and want of provisions, and the stragglers from their ranks were put to death without mercy. At length, in 1374, a truce was concluded between the two countries for one year only, but it was sub sequently renewed, and lasted till the death of Edward. Of the extensive continental dominions which once belonged to the English crown there remained at this time only Bourdeaux, Bayonnc, and a few towns on the Dordogne, together with Calais and a small strip of territory around it \u2014 the sole fruits of the splendid victories gained by the king and his gallant son. The bad health of the latter prevented the renewal of those gigantic exertions which were neces sary to recover his affairs, and to check the progress of his cautious adversary. Various attempts were made, under less able generals, to regain the advantages which had been \u00a9 O lost ; but every effort on the part of Edward, thwarted by accident, or by the greater ability which now directed the French government, tended only to plunge him into more perplexing difficulties. of affairs that even the Black Prince \u2014 the idol of the nation \u2014 joined the opposition in Parliament. But the state of his health unfitted him for active efforts, and the duke of Lancaster, his brother, who was exceedingly unpopular, monopolized all the authority of government. At length the dissatisfaction of the people reached such a height that, in the spring of 1376, Peter de la Mare, speaker of the Commons, made a formal complaint of oppressive taxation, venality, and corruption, and impeached the king's ministers, who were regarded merely as agents of the duke of Lancaster. Another complaint of the Commons affected Edward still more closely. His excellent wife, Philippa, had died seven years before, and the aged monarch had fallen com pletely under the influence of Alice Perrers, who had been a lady of the bedchamber to the queen. Among other costly pre sents he gave her the late queen's jewels, which the favourite was vain enough to \u00a9 show in public. She naturally became an object of popular dislike and outcry, and the Commons passed against her the fol lowing significant ordinance: \u2014 \"Whereas \u00a9 \u00a9 complaints have been laid before the king that certain women have pursued causes and actions in the king's court by way of maintenance and for hire and reward, which thing displeases the king, the king forbids that any woman do it for the future, and in particular Alice Perrers, under the penalty of forfeiting all that she, tbe said Alice, can forfeit, and of being banished out of the realm.\" Towards the close of his life Edward became indolent and reckless, and contracted an indifference to continental affairs not easy to be reconciled with the impetuous ardour of his earlier days. In proportion, too, as his power diminished, and the splen dour of his reputation faded, the people pressed him for concessions in savour os liberty. The very large sums also, which he had spent in prosecuting his designs against France, as well as in gratifying his favourites at home, seemed to warrant an inquiry by the Parliament into the parti culars of his expenditure. So general was the dissatisfaction with the administration In the midst of these degrading squabbles the Black Prince died on the 8th of June, 1376, to the deep grief of the whole nation, to whom his personal character and exploits had endeared him. \" The good fortune of England,\" says a contemporary historian, \" as if it had been inherent in his person, flourished in his health, languished in his sickness, and expired in his death ; for with him died all the hopes of Englishmen, and during his life they had seared no in vasion of the enemy nor encounter in"], [348, "310 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1377. battle.\"* His body was interred with great pomp in Canterbury Cathedral, near the shrine of St. Thomas h. Becket. whether viewed as a warrior, a legislator, or a patron of the arts. The impression which he made upon France, already considered as the rival and enemy of his country, endeared him to the English people, who were deeply smitten with the love of military fame. His great talents and courage rendered most of his enterprises successful; and although in his latter days the greater part of his early conquests were wrested from him, the lustre which surrounded his personal exploits was never dimmed. Victory did not desert his standards until the failure of health withdrew him, as well as his accomplished son, from the field of battle. Nor were his subjects insensible to the great advantages which resulted from the firmness and wisdom of his domestic administration. By employing abroad the more active and turbulent spirits, he preserved peace at home ; and by being constantly at the head of a powerful army, he deprived the barons of every opportunity to dispute the injunctions of his government. His popularity, too, was not a little aug mented by the apparently trivial circumstance, that he excelled in those athletic sports which are always admired in a rude age, and which at that period were sedulously practised even by persons of the highest rank. On the death of the prince the duke of Lancaster resumed all his former authority; Sir Peter de la Mare, the speaker of the Commons, was arrested, and Wdliam of Wykeham, the celebrated bishop of Win chester, was deprived of his temporalities without trial, and dismissed the court. Sir Thomas Hungerford, the duke's steward, was appointed speaker of the Parliament, which met on the 27th of January, 1377, and the opposition was reduced to a weak minority. A suspicion was even enter tained that the king might be induced to direct the succession of the crown towards the duke, instead of to young Richard, the eldest child of the renowned prince of Wales. But Edward, thinking it his duty to relieve the apprehensions of the nation on this important head, declared, in the presence of Parliament, his grandson heir and suc cessor to the throne; thereby removing all undue hopes and fears from those who desired, and from those who dreaded, the accession of Lancaster. A few months after this arrangement he died at Sheen on the 21st June, 1377, in the sixty-fifth year of of his age and the fifty-first of his reign. f Alice Perrers is said first to have plundered and then to have abandoned him in his dying moments. His servants followed her example, and a priest who went to the deserted bedside of the sovereign, and held a crucifix before him, was the only witness of his death. By his queen, Edward had seven sons and four daughters. The authority of Parliament, which in all its branches had assumed a regular form in the reign of his grandfather, acquired additional strength during the fifty years he sat on the throne. The large supplies required for his armaments rendered frequent meetings of the Legislature altogether indispensable ; and there are still extant writs of summons which prove that the representatives of the people assembled under his auspices not fewer than seventy times.* In his latter years he saw the Commons impeach his ministers, and was obliged to sacrifice Lord Latimer to their resentment. The grant of money to a sovereign, in fact, almost necessarily The reign of Edward III. is generally considered the most illustrious period in the ancient annals of England. He bore a striking resemblance to his grandfather, both in his virtues and his vices; and if we measure his character and actions by the standard of his age, we must admit that he holds a distinguished place among the monarchs of the fourteenth century, * Rot.

HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 311 implies the redress of grievances and the extension of political rights; and Edward, accordingly, at different periods of his life, listened to the voice of his Commons by removing evils of which they complained, as also by conceding privileges which they were desirous to possess. For example, he restricted the borders of purveyance, or provision for the royal household, within such limits as might prevent the abuses which were most severely felt ; while he introduced into the courts of justice a variety of improvements calculated to secure less tedious and more impartial decisions. It was, moreover, provided that the whole business should be conducted in the language of England, instead of that of France, which had hitherto been used in all legal proceed ings. It is likewise a clause in one of the statutes, that no man, of what state or condition soever, shall be put out of land or tenement, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law.* enactment was intended rather to gratify the avarice of the great barons than to secure the liberty of the subject ; because by lessening the number of crimes against the crown, which implied forfeiture of lands to the sovereign, escheats would fall more abundantly to the immediate lords, who were entitled to the estates of their vassals when convicted of felony.* The long internal peace enjoyed by the people of England allowed them to turn their thoughts to the improvement of the fine arts, particularly that of architecture, which flourished greatly in the reign of Edward III. Windsor castle still remains a noble monument of the magnificence of that age : the palace of Westminster, too, must have been constructed on a magnificent scale, if we may form au estimate of the plan from the spacious hall and chapel which have been preserved, and which continue to perpetuate the greatness of the country as the theatres of justice and legislation. The mansions of the nobles, also, no longer built as mere strongholds or places of defence, began to display some regard to elegance and comfort. But the chief triumph of the architect is to be discovered in those ecclesiastical structures by which the southern portion of this kingdom is so advantageously distinguished. England, it has been ob served, contains a greater number ofbeautiful Gothic churches than any other country in Europe ; a fact still unexplained in the history of an art which is unusually obscure, both in its origin and progress. In the Parliament of 1351, usually called the \" Blessed,\" the celebrated statute of treasons was passed, the object of which was to define the crime, and fix the application of the law. For the future, treason was con fined to seven offences: the compassing or imagining the death of the king, of his consort, or of their eldest son or heir; the violation of the person of the queen, or of the wife of the king's son and heir, or of the king's eldest daughter, not being married; the levying of war within the realm, or the adhering to the king's foreign enemies, which should be proved by some overt act to the satisfaction of a competent jury; the counterfeiting of the great seal ; forging the current coin of the realm ; and the murder of certain great officers of state, or of the judges, in the actual discharge of their duty. It is alleged, indeed, that this important The institution of the celebrated order of the Garter belongs to the era of the same monarch, and is usually mentioned by historians as a token either of his gallantry, or of that political wisdom which knew how to convert the martial spirit of the times into a cheap instrument for accomplishing his ambitious views. A story prevails, though not well authenticated by any record, that * \" Under the reign of Edward III.,\" says Sir Matthew Hale, \"the law was improved to its greatest height. The judges and pleaders were very learned. The pleadings are more polished than those in the time of Edward II. ; yet they have neither certainty, prolixity, nor obscurity. So that at the latter period of this king's reign the law seemed to be near its meridian.\" \u2014 History of the Common Law. * Hume and Sir James Mackintosh limit the offence of political treason to three cases, as including the others, namely, compassing the death of the king, levying war against him, and abetting his foreign enemies.

This earliest and most illustrious of English reformers was a member of the family of Wyclif of Wyclif, in the parish of that name, near Richmond, in Yorkshire, where he was born in 1324. Very little is known of his early years, but it is certain that he studied at Oxford, where he distin- guished himself by his extraordinary profi- ciency in almost every branch of learning then cultivated, and that in 1361 he was master or warden of Baliol College in that university. In 1360 he commenced his attacks upon the mendicant orders, whom he boldly denounced as not only useless but pernicious to the cause of religion and to the public welfare. In the struggle which Edward III. and his Parliament had to maintain against the exorbitant claims and exactions of the court of Rome, Wycliffe strenuously supported the rights of his king and country, in opposition to some nameless monk who published a tract in favour of the papal claims, and called upon the re- former by name to refute his arguments. In answer to this challenge Wycliffe published a work, in which, with a degree of ability and learning which even his adversaries were compelled to acknowledge, he refuted the arrogant claims of the church, and main- tained the right of the king and Parliament to refuse the tribute demanded by the papal court, to exercise jurisdiction over all ecclesi- astics in all civil cases, and even to alienate the property of the church. The result of the contest was the unanimous rejection by the lords temporal and spiritual of the demand on the part of Pope Urban V. of an annual tribute of a thousand marks as an acknowledgment of the feudal superiority of the pontiff over the kingdoms of England and Ireland, as contrary to the laws of the realm and the oath of the sovereign. And it was further determined by the temporal nobility and the popular representatives, that should the pope commence his threatened process against the king of England as his vassal, the strength of the nation should be instantly called to the king's aid. Edward picked up the garter of a lady (the countess of Salisbury) at a court ball, and made it the emblem of the new fraternity; exclaiming, Honi soit qui mal y pense. This origin, fanciful as it may seem, is not altogether inconsistent with the habits of \u00a9 that age ; and it is difficult in any other way to account either for the seemingly unmeaning words of the motto, or for the peculiar badge of the Order, which cannot be referred to military use or ornament.* The same reign witnessed the first serious indications of that spirit of hostility to the Romish church, which, at a later period, convulsed the greater part of Europe, and separated England from her communion. The people, whose means were heavily taxed in order to carry on the French and Scottish wars, began to question the right of the pope to certain revenues which he was wont to claim, as the supreme pastor of the universal church. The Peter-pence and first-fruits, which, though light at first and in some degree voluntary, were now felt to be grievous, did not so much afflict the public mind as the \"provisions\" to bishoprics, and even to inferior livings, by virtue of which the nomination to the most valuable preferments in the kingdom gradually fell into the hands of the Roman court. This evil had indeed been com plained of at an earlier epoch, and an Act was passed against papal provisions in the thirty-fifth year of Edward I. In the twentieth year of his grandson the Parlia ment determined to send out of the realm \" alien cardinals and other strangers \" who held appointments in the English church \u2014 resolutions which the pontiff denounced as proof of an execrable rebellion, but which he in vain attempted to resist.f During the reign of Edward appeared the first symptoms of the revolt of England against the papal authority, which was * Hume, v. ii. p 447. f Fox gives the substance of the statute in these terms : \"That such aliens enemies as be advanced to livings here in England (being in their own countries shoemakers, tailors, or chamberlains unto cardinals) should depart before Michaelmas and their livings be disposed of to poor English scholars \" Vol. i. p. 551. Hall, p 11."], [351, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1363-1377.] 313 The opinions and feelings displayed in Wycliffe's earliest work, \"The Last Age of the Church,\" which appeared in 1356, as well as his attacks on the mendicant orders and his resistance to the arrogant claims of the church, must have led his contemporaries to expect that he would recede still farther from the popish standard of orthodoxy ; but it was not till the year 1363, when he took his degree of doctor of divinity and began to read theological lectures at Oxford, that \"he broke forth into open heresy.\" These lectures, however, were received \"with very great applause;\" Wycliffe \"having such an authority in the schools,\" says Lewis,* \" that whatever he said was received as an oracle.\" In these lectures he frequently took notice of the corruptions of the begging friars, which at first he did in a soft and gentle manner, till finding that his detecting their abuses was what was acceptable to his hearers, he proceeded to deal more openly and plainly with them. improve the constitution of the church and to amend the morals of the clergy than to change its doctrines; but as his own views widened he took higher ground in his lec- tures and published works. \"The doctrine of the reformer,\" says Mr. Shirley,* \"was that the sovereignty claimed by the popes over all other earthly authority had never been delegated by God to any man ; that God had allotted only portions of dominion, par- ticular fiefs, so to speak, to each ; and if any one were to be held to be Christ's vicar upon earth \u2014 a term which he did not refuse to apply to the pope \u2014 the title was equally applicable to the temporal as to the spiritual chief. The king was the minister, the vicar of God in things temporal, and was there- fore as much bound by his office to see that temporal goods were not wasted or misap- plied by the clergy, as the clergy were to direct the spiritual affairs of the king; and while the pope and the king are indeed supreme, each in their department, every Christian holds not indeed 'in chief,' but yet he holds of God, and the final irreversible appeal is therefore to the court, not of Rome, but of heaven. The emancipation of kings from the thraldom of Rome, the emancipa- tion of the individual conscience from both pope and king, and the restoration of the church of Christ to purity by restoring her at once to poverty and independence of the state; such were the broad principles and the grand ideal aims of John de Wycliffe. No wonder that they agitated deeply the men of his own and succeeding times, and no wonder that they excited against him the fear, the hatred, and the persecutions of an arrogant and corrupt hierarchy.\" In the year 1374 Wycliffe was sent on an embassy to the pope, Gregory XL, whose residence was at Avignon. His mission, which was received at Bruges, had reference to one of the most flagrant abuses of that period, the papal reservation of benefices in the English church, which in this way came to be in many instances most unworthily bestowed upon foreigners, who were entirely ignorant of the language of the people, and were sometimes even under age. It is pro- bable that what he saw of the papal court on that occasion tended to deepen his aversion to the existing ecclesiastical system, for on his return to England he began to denounce its abuses in plain, homely, vigorous lan- guage, which must have had a powerful influence on the popular mind. One of his biographers quotes a passage from his lec- tures, in which he styles the pope \"Anti- Christ, the proud, worldly priest of Rome, and the most cursed of clippers and pursc- kervers \" (cut-purses). When Wycliffe first appeared as a reformer, he strove rather to Wycliffe had long been regarded by the priesthood with a jealous eye, but it was not till 1377 that he was summoned to appear before the convocation, which met at St. Paul's, and was presided over by Courtenay, bishop of London, a proud and overbearing prelate. On the day of trial, February 19, the dauntless reformer was accompanied by * History of the Life and Sufferings of the reverend and learned John Wycliffe, D.D. * Preface to Fasciculi Zizaniorum Magistri Johannis Wyclif. 40"], [352, "314 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1377-1378 John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and Lord Percy, earl marshal of England. A violent altercation took place in the church between these two powerful nobles and the bishop, who was so indignant at the earl marshal for requesting Wycliffe to be seated during his trial, that he declared \" if he could have guessed that the earl marshal would have played the mark there, or been so trouble some, he would not have suffered him to come into the court.\" The duke of Lancas ter took the part of his brother baron, and told the bishop that \" the earl marshal's motion was but reasonable, and that as for him, who was grown so proud and arrogant, he would bring down the pride not only of him, but of all the prelacy of England.\" The court broke up in confusion without deter mining anything against the reformer; but popular feeling among the Londoners ran high against the two nobles on account of the insult offered to the bishop, and on the following morning the mob broke open the earl marshal's house and gutted the palace of the duke at the Savoy. So violent was the riot that it even interrupted the debates in Parliament; and the lord mayor and alder men of the city were obliged, in the presence of the king, to crave the duke's pardon for the grievous offence committed by the citizens. they were addressed to \"commit John Wyc liffe to prison, and having transmitted to Rome a full account of his heretical tenets, to detain him in custody till they should receive further instructions ; but should they fail in their endeavours to seize his person, they are required to affix in suitable places a citation for his appearance before the pon tiff within three months from the date of such citation.\" These mandates do not appear to have been carried into execution; but early in 1378 a synod assembled in Archbishop Sudbury's chapel, at Lambeth, to try and condemn the reformer. The citizens of London, however, forced their way into the chapel and intimidated the synod, and a message arrived from the queen mother, the widow of the Black Prince, prohibiting the clergy from proceeding to any definite sen tence respecting the doctrine or conduct of Wycliffe. The reformer therefore returned to his former pursuits, and by his pulpit discourses, his academical lectures, and his writings, laboured to promote the cause of pure re ligion and independent thought. The great work of Wycliffe's declining years was his translation of the Bible from the Vulgate into the English tongue. This version not only made the word of God known to the common people, but is valu able also as illustrating the history of our language, for Wycliffe is justly regarded as the father of English prose. The influence of this translation of the sacred Scriptures on the public mind was great and imme diate. The Roman Catholic historian, Dr. Lingard, says, Wycliffe made \"anew trans lation of the Bible, multiplied the copies with the aid of transcribers, and by his poor priests recommended it to the perusal of their hearers. In their hands it became an engine of wonderful power. Men were flattered with the appeal to their private judgment; the new doctrines insensibly acquired par tisans and protectors in the higher classes, who alone were acquainted with the use of letters, a spirit of inquiry was generated, and In the first Parliament held after the accession of Richard II., such was the high estimatiom in which Wycliffe was held by the rulers of the state, that the question was submitted to his judgment \"whether a king dom might not in a case of necessity prevent its treasures from being conveyed to a foreign country, although it should even be de manded by the pope himself.\" The answer of the reformer, as was doubtless expected, was in the affirmative. On the 22nd of May, 1377, no fewer than four different bulls were issued against Wycliffe by Gregory XL, three of which were directed to the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London, and the fourth to the chancellor and university of Oxford. These formidable documents enjoined the parties to whom"], [353, "A.D. 1381-1384.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 315 the seeds were sown of that religious revo lution which, in little more than a century, astonished and convulsed the nations of Europe.\" was to be found there, not by the priests alone, but by all who should earnestly seek to know it. The doctrines taught by Wyc liffe were substantially in accordance with those now held by the evangelical party in the Church of England. In his writings the paramount authority of the Holy Scriptures is acknowledged and inculcated in the most explicit terms, and on the foundation of their testimony his opinions are constantly based. Persons of all ranks and conditions were among his followers, and the influence of his writings was powerfully felt on the Continent as well as in England. The Bohe mians who frequented the English court in the train of Richard II.'s queen, the king of Bohemia's sister, on returning to their own country carried with them some of the works of the great reformer, and these were held in the highest veneration by John Huss and his disciples. The Council of Constance, which in shameful violation of the safe-conduct granted by the Emperor Sigismund consigned Huss to the flames, pronounced sentence of condemnation on the whole of Wycliffe's writings, and de creed that his memory should be held infa mous, and that his bones, which had now lain in the dust for forty years, should be dug up and scattered on the dunghill. In obedience to this mandate the officers of the bishop of Lincoln came to Lutterworth, and as Thomas Fuller says, \" took what was left of Wycliffe's body out of the grave and burnt it to ashes, and cast them into the Swift, a neighbouring brook running hard by. Thus this brook has conveyed his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into the main ocean ; and thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the em blems of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over.\"* Wycliffe at length raised his voice against several of the doctrines of the church, and in 1381 he put forth twelve theses against the dogma of transubstantiation. A prose cution was in consequence again excited against him, and the duke of Lancaster, who had hitherto befriended the reformer, was either afraid or was not prepared to sup port him in his attack on what was consid ered a fundamental doctrine of the church. Wycliffe was summoned before a convoca tion held at Oxford; but although he made no recantation of his alleged errors, his judges did not venture to treat him as an obstinate heretic. They, however, pro nounced twenty-four conclusions, drawn out of his writings, to be heretical, appointed search to be made in Oxford for copies of his works, and condemned him to be ban ished from the university. This sentence having been confirmed by the government, Wycliffe withdrew to Lutterworth, of which he was rector, and spent there the short remainder of his career. It is probable that nothing but his advanced age and the ap proach of death saved him from further persecution at the hands of the exasperated church. He was summoned in 1384 to appear before the pope, but in his reply ex cusing himself from compliance with this citation, he gave his Holiness some salutary counsel, and informed him that he neither felt strength nor inclination for so long a journey. His constitution was exhausted by his multifarious labours, and on the 29th December of the same year, while he was hearing mass in his own church at Lutter- o worth, a stroke of paralysis deprived him of speech. Two days later he expired, in the sixtieth year of his age. * Fuller's Chnreh History. Vaughan's Life and Opinions of John de Wycliffe, D.D., 2 vols. 8vo.

The affection which still clung to the memory of the Black Prince rendered the accession of his son, Richard of Bordeaux, an occurrence of much joy to the great body of the English people. But serious dangers threatened his government, which could not have been obviated by any degree of judgment or experience : his uncles, Lan caster, York, and Gloucester, were ambitious and disappointed, and had, even during the closing years of their brother's reign, affected the popular interest against the ministers of the crown. To exclude these from all share in the government could net fail to create a formidable opposition ; while to exalt any one of them to the regency would endanger the succession to the throne. It was therefore resolved that a council might be chosen to direct the public busi ness in concurrence with his Majesty.* elected two of their own number to collect the revenue and superintend its disburse ment. In other matters, too, they had frequent recourse to remonstrance and admonition. For example, at an early period they complained of \"the government about the king's person, his court, the excessive number of his servants, of the abuses in the Chancery, King's Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, and of grievous oppressions occasioned by the great mul titudes of maintainers of quarrels, who behaved like kings in the country, so that there was very little law or right.\" Such a spirit, manifested so openly by one of the estates of the realm, would have required a corresponding vigour in the executive. But the energies of the council were distracted by the wars which had been revived in France, or were threatened by Scotland. Richard had likewise to encounter the hostility of Spain, excited by the claims of the duke of Lancaster to the throne of Castile, of which he con sidered himself the heir, in right of his wife, the daughter of Peter the Cruel. Various expeditions were fitted out under the royal dukes, who inherited the military propensities of their father without his genius ; but their success did not correspond to their magnitude, nor to the importance The Commons made an effort to obtain for the legislature the right of nominating all the great officers of state during the king's minority; but this demand, as it seemed to divest the barons of an inherent privilege, was not conceded. Defeated in this object, they determined to exercise control in a department in which their voice would command attention ; and accordingly, on the first meeting of Parliament, they \u2022 Walsingham, p. 150.

Newgate was next demolished, and the prisoners set at liberty. The Temple was burnt, with all the books and valuable records it contained. The priory of St. John of Jerusalem shared the same fate, and numbers of the rich citizens and of the Flemings in the city were put to death. Richard, who found little safety in the Tower, to which, in the first instance, he had been advised to retire, resolved to hold a conference with his misguided subjects on the principal heads of their complaint; and upon finding that they would be satisfied with a general pardon, the abolition of slavery, the removal of certain restrictions on trade, and a fixed rent on land, in place of the services due by them as villains attached to the soil, he consented to all their demands. Returning towards London, he met Wat Tyler, followed by a strong body of his partizans, proceeding, it may be supposed, to join the head-quarters of the insurgents; and he entered into conversation \u00a9 7 with him on the points which had already been discussed and settled with the main body on the heath. Tyler, it is reported, made use of some gestures which excited the suspicion of Walworth the lord mayor, who, imagining that he meant to assassinate i \u00a9 \u00a9 the king, struck him to the ground with his sword. His Majesty owed his escape from the hands of the infuriated multitude to his own presence of mind. He offered to become their leader and protector; advancing at the same time towards their ranks, and expressing in his countenance the utmost reliance upon their fidelity and good dispositions. They allowed themselves to be conducted into the fields, where they were soon induced or compelled to separate (June, 1381).* The main embarrassment of the adminis tion, however, did not arise from the failure of these undertakings, however much it might mortify the pride and exhaust the resources of the kingdom. A cause of disturbance, hitherto unknown in this country, sprang from that augmented love of freedom which had now descended even to the lowest class of the people. The progress of the boroughs in wealth and consideration excited among the peasantry a strong desire to possess similar privileges; and, as they were now made subject to taxation, they, with some show of reason, thought themselves entitled to be consulted in the management of public affairs. An example of insurrection had been presented by the same order of persons in France and the Low Countries ; while at home the feeling of dissatisfaction was cherished by popular orators, who addressed the passions of jealousy and revenge, two of the most powerful emotions that can rouse the human heart. The harangues of Ball, a seditious preacher, were eagerly listened to, while he dilated on the natural equality of mankind, and the numerous evils arising from artificial distinctions. A poll tax, exigible from every one who had attained the age of fifteen, and the unfeeling manner in which it was collected, inflamed popular indignation to such a height that an appeal was made to arms, and the public peace was menaced with a serious interruption. f The names of Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, and Hob Carter, though probably assumed to conceal designations which might belong to a higher rank in society, are closely associated with the insurrection which alarmed England in the fourth year of this reign. These leaders are said to have conducted to Blackheath a hundred thousand rustics from the counties of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and the contiguous districts.

[a.d. 1385. relief at the head of forty thousand men. The appearance of such a force was sufficient to drive the rebels to submission; but the conduct of Richard, after victory was secured, could not be compared, in point of generosity or prudence, to the policy which he adopted towards them while they were yet in the field. The pardon and enfranchisement which had been promised were not bestowed. On the contrary, the people were compelled to return to their ancient servitude ; and many of those who were accounted ring leaders were visited with the severest penalties of the law. More than fifteen hundred, it is said, perished by the hand of the executioner; of whom not a few were sentenced to meet death without even the formalities of a regular trial.* to guard against the wiles of his domestic enemies, prompted him to disregard a counsel which seemed to promise complete success. He accordingly withdrew his forces from a country which he had wasted without seeing an enemy, and after sustaining at their hands greater evils than he had inflicted upon them.* At this juncture the duke of Lancaster carried into Spain the flower of the English army, to prosecute his pretensions to a throne which he now discovered he could not ascend otherwise than by right of conquest, f At first he was everywhere victorious. He de feated the Spaniards in a pitched battle, and took many towns. But in a second campaign his army was almost annihilated by disease or famine, and he was compelled by declining health to return to Guienne. In the end he concluded a peace with the Castilian monarch on very advantageous terms. The prince of Asturias, heir to the throne, espoused his daughter Catherine, and the king of Castile agreed to pay two hundred thousand crowns to Lancaster for the expenses he had incurred, and also to settle on the duke and duchess an annuity of forty thousand florins. The descendants of John of Gaunt occupied the throne of Spain for many generations. The war with Scotland, although sus pended from time to time by the interven tion of treaties, was not yet brought to a satisfactory termination. Richard, who had gained some reputation by his presence of mind at Smithfield, thought himself qualified to lead an army against his relative, the king of Scots, who, acting in concert with France, had assumed a menacing attitude. A body of heavy cavalry, supplied by Charles, was intended to place his northern ally on a footing of equality with the English, whose troops were generally better mounted and equipped. The invaders crossed the border at Berwick, and proceeded along the eastern coast, committing devastations upon such towns and villages as were not already stripped by their inhabitants, until they arrived at the capital, which they also took and burned. But in the meantime the Scottish army poured into Cumberland by the western marches, and advancing into Yorkshire, loaded themselves with booty. Richard was advised to wait their return, and bring them to battle on the borders, assured of an easy victory over a host of marauders incumbered with spoil. His impatience to visit the softer scenes of Eltham or Windsor, and perhaps his anxiety The project of an invasion of England had for some time been entertained by the French court, and the absence of John of Gaunt, who was reckoned by them the bravest soldier and the wisest counsellor of the hostile kingdom, as well as the diversion created by the invasion of the Scots, seemed to afford a favourable opportunity of carry ing their design into effect. The dissen sions which distracted the English court were well known at Paris and throughout the Low Countries, encouraging the hope that little resistance would be made to a foreign enemy who promised a triumph to one of the contending parties. Not satisfied with the hope of a victory, which might cripple their foe and secure an advantageous * Walsingham, p. 207 Rot. Part 5 Richard II.

Taxes and talliages to so burdensome an extent that \"for one hundred years before there were none such seen,\" were assessed through out the kingdom ; the rich men gave up a third and fourth part of their goods, and many paid more than they were worth be side to furnish the war. During six months the inhabitants of the coast \" did nothing \u00a9 else but grind corn and bake biscuit.\" Ships were taken up in every port \" from Seville to Prussia,\" and stores of all kinds arrived so plentifully in Flanders \" that in time to come it could not be believed but by them that saw it.\" Lords, knights, squires, and men of war were written unto in far coun tries and desired to come and serve the king in his journey, \"as out of Savoy, Almayne, and from the Swiss, going down to the land of the earl of Armynack. I trow, sithe God created the world, there was never seen so many great ships together as were that year at Sluys and Blankenburg,\" for in September there were counted in the har bour of the former port alone one thousand two hundred and eighty-seven vessels. AVhoso had seen the turmoil and labour in charging these ships with their cargoes, \" if he had been sick, I think he would have clean forgotten all pain.\" ships from the one end to the other, glyster- ing with gold and devices and arms.\" The lord of Tremouille disbursed more than two thousand francs in this rich garnishing of his ship. How simple and how expressive is the short commentary subjoined ! \" And the poor people of the realm paid for all ; for the talliages, these were so great to furnish this voyage that they that were most rich sorrowed for it, and the poor fled for it.\" But the most extraordinary work ever constructed to accompany the march of an army, one which even the insane pride and profusion of the Persian kings would per- haps have regarded as chimerical, was a portable town, which the constable de Clis- son undertook to provide in Brittany. It consisted of a huge square of jointed frame- work, presenting fronts, each of which measured three thousand paces in length; entire houses were ranged within its circuit, surrounding a fortress in which were to be established the royal quarters. The whole fabric was easily put together or taken to pieces every day, in a few hours, and when ready for embarkation formed the burden of seventy-two transports. About the middle of August Charles took leave of his queen and the ladies of the court, having vowed solemnly, after a mass in Notre Dame, that he would never re-enter Paris till he had made a descent upon England. The pro- gress of his hosts spread desolation over the districts which they traversed, and when he arrived at Arras \"the country was clean eaten up; nothing was left abroad, but it was taken without paying, so that the poor country people that had gathered together their corn had nothing left them but straw, and if they spake thereof they were beaten or slain. When they saw their goods taken and spent away, and durst not speak there against, they cursed between their teeth, saying, ' Go into England or to the devil, and never return again !'\" Nor was it only on munitions of war that treasure was expended. Much was lavished in gorgeous show and luxury. \"Gold and silver was no more spared than though it rained out of the clouds, or scummed out of the sea. They made banners, pennons, standards of silk so goodly, it was marvellous to behold, and painted the masts of their Meantime in England no preparations for offence were omitted. The several ports and havens were stored and garrisoned; beacons were erected on all eminences near"], [358, "320 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1385-1386. assurances that nothing else was wanting but his presence, the winter season was sore come on before the duke quitted Paris, and even then, when he rode forward, it was but by small journeys.\" The constable, either impatient of delay, or supposing that the king had already embarked, sailed from the coast of Brittany about Michaelmas with his wooden town and a large division of soldiers. A fair wind soon carried him to the mouth of the Thames, but off Mar- gate his fleet was dispersed by a storm ; seven ships were taken in Zealand, and three or four, laden with part of the closure of timber, were driven into the Thames, and captured with all their masters, car- penters, and artificers, to the great joy of the Londoners and the king, who ordered the fragments of his trophy to be set up in the neighbourhood of Winchelsea. De Clisson himself, after much difficulty, made the harbour of Sluys, and surprised and mortified Charles by intelligence of his disaster. The Flemings began to suspect that the expedition would be abandoned ; and smarting under both immediate suffer ings and the remembrance of the defeat at Rosebecque, they showed unequivocal symptoms of restlessness, and \" were ready for wagging of a rush to make debate and strife.\" \" And alwaies the time passed, and the winter approached, and the lords lay there in great cold and peril.\" Decem ber had commenced before the duke of Bern arrived at Sluys, and after some days' waste under pretext of examining the condition of the armament, and a brief further dissembling, he openly protested against permitting the expedition to sail at so unfavourable a season, since the most part of the realm was set upon it ; he him self, indeed, he said, and his fair brother of Burgundy were ready to undertake the enterprise ; but he was very far from counselling that the king, \"who in a manner was but a child,\" should be a party to it. Charles evinced much personal courage, and seemed resolved to persevere ; but the advice of the duke of Berri pre- the coast; for the greater safety of London Rochester bridge was broken down, and a plan of operations was devised which could scarcely have failed of eventual success. The French were to be allowed to land and even to advance three or four days' march into the country; an attack was then to be made upon their fleet, and if that could be mastered, it was calculated that want of provisions and the weakness resulting from perpetual skirmishes, in which without any regular battle they were to be harried and kept waking, would soon effectually destroy the invaders. There were ready for the field one hundred thousand archers and ten thousand men-at-arms. But, above all, notwithstanding the griev ous financial pressure, so that many a man sorrowed long after, there was a spirit ani mating the population at large which neither menace nor actual suffering could impair. The Commons saw that taxation was need ful, and although more than two millions of florins were required from them, they said, \" It is not against reason though we be taxed now, and to give of our goods to knights and squires, to defend their heri tages and ours.\" The prelates and men of the church made processions in every town daily three or four times a week, trembling themselves in their hearts, and beseeching God in great devotion, with prayers and orisons, to deliver them from peril ; and the light companions, in comforting of them selves and of them that were abashed, said : \"Let these Frenchmen come; there shall not one tail of them return again into France !\" But the courage thus manifested at the outset was not to be put to the extreme test. While Charles awaited the completion of his gatherings at Sluys, the year wore on, and the duke of Berri, who had \"spoken fairly, but who had no great appetite to go into England,\" was still tarrying behind. The time passed, and the days shortened and began to be foul and cold, and the nights long. But notwithstanding re peated summonses from the kin<r, and"], [359, "A.d. 1392-1396.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 321 vailed, and the lords and their companies were dismissed on an engagement to reas semble in the following March and April. \" This breaking up of the voyage, which cost the realm of France one hundred thousand francs, thirty times told,* greatly distressed the king, and sent away many of his noblest followers evil content.\" for four years. But a far more important treaty was concluded in 1396, with the view of cementing pacific relations between the two countries. Richard II. had now de manded in marriage the hand of Isabella, daughter of the French king. Though the princess was only in her seventh year, the proposal was readily acceded to ; and after a great display of magnificence in sumptuous interviews between the two monarchs, held at a frontier spot of their separate dominions, between Andres and Calais, the nuptials were solemnized at the latter town. The portion of the bride was eight hundred thousand livres, and Charles pledged him self to aid the English monarch with the whole of his disposable power against any of his rebellious subjects.* The project of invading England was renewed in the following spring, and arma ments were prepared at Treguier and Har fleur. But the expedition was frustrated by a bitter quarrel between the Constable de Clisson, to whom the command had been intrusted, and the duke of Brittany. Early in 1392 negotiations were entered into for a permanent peace between the two countries, and the French king in person repaired to Amiens, where the English plenipotentiaries awaited him. Their re ception was accompanied with the most brilliant pageantry, and the dukes of York and of Lancaster, with their train of more than twelve hundred horse, were sump tuously entertained during the whole time of their residence in France at the king's charge. The demand that Calais should be abandoned formed the chief obstacle to the conclusion of the peace. The French insisted that it should be utterly razed and left desolate ; the English princes replied that \" they dared in no wise speak thereof,\" for if they did they should encounter the hatred and indignation of the greater part of their countrymen. After fifteen days of fruitless discussion, the truce was prolonged for another year. At parting Charles then warmly urged the duke of Lancaster to employ his best offices in mediating a permanent friendship between the two kingdoms, in order that with their united force they might make the voyage to Turkey, comforting the king of Hungary and the emperor of Constantinople, whom \" Lamorabarquyesf doth much trouble.\" In 1393 it was agreed that the truce between France and England should be prolonged The duke of Gloucester, in the absence of his more politic brother Lancaster, attempted to seize the reins of government, which were held with no steady hand by the young king. Eichard, indeed, instead of displaying a more improved capacity as he advanced in years, afforded daily proofs that he wanted both the vigour and intelligence requisite to guide the affairs of a bold and rather turbulent nation. Like all weak monarchs, too, he addicted himself to favouritism ; choosing his friends, as often happens, for qualities which only amused his leisure hours, and withdrew his mind from the more pressing cares of state. Among these minions was De la Vere, a young man of noble family, but more remarkable for his easy manners and good address than for strict ness of moral conduct. Him the indulgent prince raised to the invidious title of duke of Ireland, and bestowed upon him a lady of royal rank as his wife ; making him, at the same time, the channel of all access to the throne, as well as the medium through which the highest honours were obtained, t The chancellor, whose name was De la Pole, was more worthy of his confidence, but not less hated by the discontented barons, who had resolved to accomplish his * Froissart, vol. ii. c. cxvi.

The opinion delivered by those learned persons removed all doubt from his mind with regard to the treasonable nature of the confederacy whence the late project had emanated ; stating, that those who had advised him to such a step had incurred the penalty of traitors ; that those who compelled him to accede to its provisions had forfeited their lives ; and that such as should persist in maintaining the authority of the commission were liable to a similar punishment. This judgment they respec tively signed in the presence of five prelates and several lay peers.* downfall. Gloucester, who led the faction opposed to his nephew, prevailed upon the Commons to impeach this minister, though possessing the high recommendation of having gained the esteem of Edward III. by his distinguished talents, military as well as civil. He was accused of various misdemeanors, and especially of having accepted five hundred pounds a year to support the dignity of his title when created earl of Suffolk. Being found guilty, he was obliged to resign his office, surrender his revenues, and absent himself from the council of his sovereign \u2014 the main object which his enemies had in view when they originated the prosecution.* But Gloucester was not satisfied with this triumph achieved over his youthful king: he meditated an expedient, not altogether new indeed in the history of the Planta genets, by which he might strip him of the royal authority, and render him a mere tool in the hands of a few nobles, who thirsted for supreme power. He suggested the appointment of a commission, consisting almost entirely of his own creatures, to whom the charge of public affairs should be confided for twelve months ; an arrange ment to which, though he could not but feel that he was thereby virtually dethroned, Richard found it necessary to yield his assent. He did not, however, allow the Parliament to separate before he had entered a public protest that, notwithstanding the concession he had been induced to make, the prerogatives of the crown were still undiminished in extent as well as in authority.! By the treachery of Fulthorpe, justice of the King's Bench, the proceedings of the king were exposed to the duke of Gloucester, who soon appeared in the neighbourhood of London, whither Richard had returned, at the head of a numerous force. There is no doubt that it was the intention of those who guided the royal mind to indict the framers of the commission, and to dissolve the extraordinary government sounded upon it; hence the decision with which the other party acted was obviously suggested by their fears, as well as by the desire to anticipate a blow likely to prove fatal. As the popular voice was in favour of the insurgents, it was in vain that the king issued a proclamation forbidding the citizens to supply them with provisions. They entered the capital to the amount of forty thousand, professing that their sole object was to deliver the sovereign from the influence of evil counsels ; and having pushed forward to Westminster, their lead ers obtained an audience, during which they branded with the imputation of treason the archbishop of York, the duke of Ire land, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Trcsilian, lord chief justice, and Sir Nicholas Brember, who had thrice held the office of lord mayor. Richard promised to sum- Richard, who soon perceived the amount of degradation which had been inflicted on him, did not appear insensible to the argu ments of those who recommended measures of resistance. But before he took any step which might involve the country in a civil war, he consulted the principal judges and lawyers as to the legality of the commission * Knyghton, p. 2083. t Knyghton gives the names of the fourteen commissioners, among whom are the two archbishops, and the bishops of Ely and Hereford. * Knyghton, p. 2094."], [361, "a.d. 1388. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 323 mon a Parliament in which the charges should be duly examined, and declared that in the meantime he would endeavour to protect each faction from the designs of the other* Richard resolved to exercise once more the rights of sovereignty in his own person, than all difficulties vanished, his enemies were paralyzed, and his friends were restored at once to confidence and power. This unexpected change was probably the result of a secret compromise, the history of which has not been revealed ; a conjecture not a little strengthened by the circumstance that, while the king exercised the utmost for bearance towards those who had wrested the sceptre from his hand, he did not immediately interpose in behalf of their victims, some of whom were still in exile or in prison. The return about this period of Lancaster from his Spanish enterprise had, there is reason to presume, some influence on the state of public affairs : for although his ambition occasionally impelled him to assume more than a fitting share in the government, he disapproved of the rebel lious conduct of his brother Gloucester.* De la Vere, who, with the rest of the royal adherents, had sought safety in flight, made an attempt to retrieve the affairs of his master by inviting to his standard a body of Welsh, and a chosen band of archers, under the constable of Chester. But this unseasonable effort only augmented the danger with which he was menaced, and gave a colour of justice to the severities which Gloucester was now determined to employ. Parliament, which met on the 3rd of February, 1388, condemned the duke of Ireland and his four colleagues to death ; of which number, however, only two were actually executed. De la Vere escaped to Holland, where he died a few years afterwards ; the earl of Suffolk expired at Paris ; and the archbishop succeeded in concealing himself until the rage of his enemies had cooled. Brember and the lord chief justice were capitally punished at Tyburn. The other judges, who had sub scribed the opinion which occasioned this reaction, were likewise convicted ; but, on the intercession of the queen, had their lives spared on condition of being consigned to perpetual imprisonment in Ireland. Her good offices were not equally efficacious in favour of Sir Simon Burley, the tutor of her husband ; for though she remained tnree hours on her knees before the duke of Gloucester, her entreaties for his safety were sternly refused.! A period of eight years elapsed unmarked by any memorable event at home or abroad. The affairs of France were adjusted by mutual concessions ; and both kingdoms, exhausted by domestic contention and expensive armaments, gladly accepted the repose of a long truce. The northern marches were from time to time disturbed by inroads of the Scotch, to whom rapine and desultory warfare appear to have become habitual ; and on one occasion a desperate fight took place at Otterburn (15th August, 1388), between the Scottish earl of Douglas and Lord Harry Percy, the renowned Hot spur, the remembrance of which is still preserved in a variety of national ballads. f Douglas was slain, but his troops were victorious, and Hotspur and his brother were taken prisoners. This storm, which seemed to shake the foundations of the throne, was succeeded by a calm not less sudden and much more inexplicable. The violence and sanguinary temper of the \" appellants,\" as they were usually called, must in the course of a few months have turned against them the cur rent of popular feeling ; for no sooner had During this interval the private habits of Richard did not contribute to raise him in the public esteem. Relinquishing the warlike pursuits of his ancestors, he gave himself up to indolence and pleasure, * Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 173. Walsingham, p. 337. Rymer, vii. 017. Rot. Parl. iii. 258.

Gloucester once more took advantage of this imbecility in his nephew, and laboured to withdraw from him the affection of his subjects. It is suspected that he had more serious designs than ever upon the throne, not concealing his conviction that the welfare of the nation required a change in the head of the government ; and con sequently, without naming a successor, he ventured to suggest the deposition of the reigning sovereign. Richard, whose past experience would induce him to believe any rumours which impeached the loyalty of his uncle, resolved on this occasion to anticipate his designs, and forthwith gave orders to seize his person. The duke was hurried on board a ship which was in readiness to receive him, landed at Calais, where alone he could be securely detained, and soon afterwards either fell a sacrifice to an unhealthy prison or was secretly murdered. That he died a violent death, considering the time and circumstances, was not only probable in itself, but was rendered almost certain by evidence which was elicited at a subsequent period.* His chief supporters were brought to trial before the Parliament on a charge of treason, and found guilty. The earl of Arundel was beheaded on Tower hill, the archbishop of Canterbury was banished for life, and the sentence of death passed on the earl of Warwick was commuted into perpetual imprisonment in the Isle of Man (September, 1397). denounced the commission framed under his auspices ; declared it treasonable to attempt to frame any such board in future ; proclaimed the opinions of the judges on that question to be legal and constitutional ; and reversed the sentence which had been passed on De la Pole, the earl of Suffolk. These conclusions were sanctioned by the duke of York and the earl of Derby, one of whom was a member of the celebrated commission, and the other led the rebel army to Haringay, in order to intimidate his royal cousin and force him to submit. The Lords and Commons having con firmed their acts in a manner the most solemn, proceeded to replenish the ex chequer by liberal grants, some of which were voted to the king for life. That body,' indeed, as if to compensate for their former undutiful conduct towards him, made haste to legislate against their own decrees, and to visit with severe penalties their warmest friends. Political transactions in many cases are covered with a veil which the historian has difficulty either in penetrating or in drawing aside ; but the reign of Richard is peculiarly remarkable for the occurrence of the most importantrevolutions, in opinion as well as in the rise and fall of parties, the causes of which it is now impossible to determine. A quarrel between Mowbray duke of Norfolk and Henry of Bolingbroke (now duke of Hereford), the eldest son of the duke of Lancaster, was attended with mem orable results, and finally led to the abdica tion of the king. Bolingbroke alleged that Norfolk had declared to him that no In taking this decisive step, however, the king appears to have enjoyed the coun tenance of Lancaster and York, as well as of many others who formerly encouraged the opposite faction. Even the Parliament, for some time accustomed to be swayed by popular motives, readily annulled all the acts in which Gloucester had taken a share ; trust could be put in Richard's promises or oaths, and that he knew of a certainty that the king and his minions were then com passing the deaths of the dukes of Lancaster, Hereford, Albemarle, and Exeter, the mar quis of Dorset, and of himself. Norfolk denied these statements, and denounced Bolingbroke as a liar and false traitor. Richard, instead of submitting the case to Parliament, referred it to a court of chivalry, which decided that the dispute should be * Cotton, Abridgment, p. 378. Froissart, book iv. c. xc.

But on the appointed day, when the combatents were in the lists and had couched their lances, the king forbade the combat, and took the settlement of the quarrel into his own hands. To the surprise of all men he condemned both nobles to exile, Boling broke for ten years, and Mowbray for life. The latter undertook a pilgrimage to Jeru salem, and not long after died broken hearted at Venice ; but Bolingbroke went no farther than France. While residing there he contracted an alliance with the daughter of the duke of Berri, a cousin of Charles VI. ; a circumstance which excited the jealousy of the English monarch, who already dreaded, not without reason, the powerful influence of the house of Lancaster. To defeat the union of his relative with the royal line of the Capets, Richard had recourse to means which tended to increase the aversion with which his government was already viewed by the great body of the people, who prized the martial spirit and chivalrous character of young Hereford. views, declaring that he had no other object in appearing at the head of an army so extremely formidable, except the recovery of the duchy of Lancaster, which belonged to him by inheritance. His actions, how ever, did not in all respects correspond to tbe mildness of his professions ; for he had no sooner reduced Bristol, into which some of the king's ministers had thrown them selves, than, yielding to the popular clamour, he ordered the earl of Wiltshire, Sir John Bussey, and Sir Henry Green to be executed. The duke of York, who had been left by his nephew guardian of the realm, assembled an army with the view of supporting the royal interests, so far at least as to pre vent an actual revolution and a transference of the crown. He could not, however, shut his eyes to the justice of the claims urged by Henry, who had much reason to complain of the decision whereby he had been deprived of his paternal domains and stigmatized as a dangerous subject. The soldiers, too, who had obeyed the duke's sum mons and flocked around the royal standard, became suddenly biassed in favour of the gallant prince who had fearlessly thrown himself upon the generosity of his country men ; and so uncertain were their affections, that it was probable they would have refused to draw their swords against him had they been led into the field of battle. York himself gradually inclined towards the views of the ambitious and politic invader, who advanced towards his object under the cover of humility and patriotic declarations. While these matters were in progress, the death of the duke of Lancaster threw his wealth and authority into the hands of his heir, who, though an exile in a foreign land, thought himself entitled to immediate possession of his immense estates. But the kiilg, moved by his fears rather than by that generosity which might have gained the heart of his rival, revoked his letters patent and seized the lands to which the other had so just a claim. Such conduct could not fail to gain many partizans for the new duke ; and accordingly, in the summer of 1399, when Richard embarked for Ireland with an army, to punish some act of insubordination on the part of the natives, the noble exile landed at Raven spur in Yorkshire (July, 1399), where he was immediately joined by a large force under the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland.* Three weeks elapsed before the news were conveyed to Richard that his throne was in jeopardy. Upon being made aware of the real condition of things, he sent the earl of Salisbury into Wales with all his disposable forces, hoping that the spirit of insurrection min-ht still be checked or subdued, and in tending to follow with the remainder of his troops. But it soon appeared that a crisis had arisen to which the feeble genius of the king was altogether unequal ; and as Salis bury had failed to make any impression, the royal cause was now generally regarded Henry, who soon found himself master of the kingdom, affected great moderation in his * Walsingham, p. 343.

The sovereign, with a few faithful adherents, shut himself up in Conway castle, whence he could main tain a communication with Ireland, and where he intended to await the return of his people to more dutiful sentiments. The office of decoying him from that stronghold was committed to the earl of Northumber land, who was instructed to assure him that the duke of Lancaster would be perfectly satisfied with a free Parliament, an uncon ditional pardon for himself and all who had lent their aid to his enterprise, restoration to his inheritance, and the infliction of a condign punishment on the murderers of Gloucester. Richard consented to a con ference with his wily cousin, who at their first meeting at Flint castle treated him with every demonstration of respect and attachment, though he had resolved to con sign him to a prison, and even to deprive him of his crown and life. He was directed to issue writs for assembling a Parliament, as well as a proclamation for preserving the peace, after which he was hurried to London and confined in the Tower.* duke of Lancaster stepped into the vacant throne under the title of Henry IV. The remaining portion of Richard's his- tory is melancholy and obscure. It was re- solved by Parliament that, as his life was to be spared, he should be kept in some secret place under a sufficient guard, and all inter- course between him and his friends should be strictly prohibited. He was accord- ingly conveyed to Pontefract castle, where he soon afterwards perished, either from hunger or by a more active violence. The manner of his death has been so carefully concealed as to give rise to various rumours respecting his end ; of which some, though very romantic and improbable, have reached our times, accompanied with a certain sem- blance of evidence. But after all that has been written on the subject little positive information can be added to what is stated by Froissart, who was the attached depend- ant and friend of the king's family. \" How Richard died and by what means, I could not tell when I wrote this chronicle.\" A body was shown in public, said to be that of the king, which, as it bore no appearance of wounds, refuted the popular calumny that he had been murdered by Sir Piers Exton and the soldiers, who, it was alleged, fell upon him with their weapons and put an end to his sufferings. Another and more probable supposition is that the un- fortunate monarch was starved to death. These events occurred in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign ; presenting the second example, within a comparatively short period, of a sovereign having been suffered to sink under the jealousy of the barons and the intrigues of a faction.* After a brief interval, a deputation of Lords and Commons waited on the captive monarch, to obtain from him a renunciation of the royal authority, dictating for the pur pose the following words : \u2014 \" I confess, recognize, and, from certain knowledge con scientiously declare, that I consider myself to have been, and to be, insufficient for the government of this kingdom, and for my notorious demerits not undeserving of depo sition.\" On the 30th September Parliament met, when an impeachment against the king, consisting of many articles, was submitted to their judgment without any very minute examination of evidence. He was found guilty of various acts of malversation in his high office, in consequence of which he was declared unworthy to hold any longer the sceptre of England ; and no sooner was the sentence of deposition pronounced than the Richard was unquestionably deficient in many of the qualities necessary to an Eng lish monarch at the turbulent, unsettled * It was rumoured that Richard escaped to Scotland, where he lived many years, being detained there by the Regent Albany, who in his turn was gratified by the cap tivity of his nephew, James I. of Scotland.

He had neither the passion nor the talent for mili tary exploits, the glory of which had now mixed deeply with the national character ; and although the reverses sustained in the latter years of Edward III. might have satis fied tbe people that success in arms is ex tremely inconstant, and must be purchased at a high price, they longed eagerly for a renewal of the triumphs which threw such a lustre on the fields of Crecy and Poictiers. Henry IV. \u2014 a.d. 1399-1413. The circumstances which attended the accession of Henry IV. necessarily gave rise to much trouble and distrust. Aware that his title was liable to just dispute, he never brought it to the decision of con stitutional law, nor measured its validity by any direct comparison with the claims of others. He chose to avail himself rather of a popular tradition in regard to his ances tor Edmund, earl of Lancaster, who was supposed to have been the eldest son of Henry III., and to have been deprived of the throne in consequence of some personal defects which, in that martial age, were thought to disqualify him for the essential duties of a sovereign prince. It is imagined to have been in reference to this covert pretension that, upon assuming the functions of royalty, Henry addressed the assembled peers in the following terms: \u2014 \"In the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I, Henry of Lancaster, challenge this realm of England, and the Crown, with all the appurtenances, as that I am descended by right line of the blood, coming from the good lord King Henry III., and through that right which God of his grace hath sent me, with help of my kin and friends to recover it ; the which realm was in point to be undone for default of governance and undoing of good laws.\"* The power of Parliament, or rather, per haps, of the great barons by whom its deliberations were directed, received a con siderable increase during this reign. The O D influence of the monarch on many occasions was seen to give way to that of the aristoc racy ; this body usually commanding the voices of the lower House, or seducing them by groundless promises of future advantage. Edward had been compelled by his necessi ties to barter privileges to the Commons for their ready grants of money ; Richard, on the other hand, tacitly allowed them to extend their immunities and even to invade the royal prerogative, convinced that his efforts to repress their innovations could not, without the aid of the Peers, have been attended with success. The prevalence of the popular spirit was occasionally manifested during the agita tions which arose from the new opinions on the subject of religion, supported by Wycliffe and his followers. There were then sub mitted to the examination of Parliament topics connected with ecclesiastical affairs and the supremacy of the pope, to which, at a former period, the members would have deemed themselves altogether incompetent. In most of the discussions which ensued the lower House showed a disposition to take part with the reformers, to protect their doctrines so far as they seemed to impugn the infallible judgment of the church, and to countenance every attempt to depress the hierarchy. It was not, however, till after the death of Wycliffe, that his doctrines pene trated deep into a soil by that time prepared for their reception. Sensible that he would give great offence to the English nation if he should urge any claim on the ground of conquest, the new king wisely abstained from all open expression of his views on a topic so extremely delicate ; and yet, during the ceremony of the coronation, he appears to have insinuated some such title to the throne : for, besides observing the usual forms, he commanded that the sword which he wore when he landed at Ravenspur should be carried unsheathed in the procession, f His descent from the progenitor whom he named as the source of his hereditary right will be made clear by the following scheme, \u2022 Knyghton, p 2757. t Rymer, vol. viii. p. 89"], [366, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The lords, who had seconded the views of the late king against his uncle, were now summoned to defend their pro- ceedings, or to suffer the penalty of false accusers \u2014 a step which led to the most indecent altercation, and to the exchange of several challenges to mortal combat. Not fewer than forty gauntlets were thrown on the floor by peers who had branded one another as liars and traitors to their sove- reign. Henry possessed sufficient influence over both parties to prevent the actual shedding of blood ; but he found it neces- sary to proceed with the utmost caution against those noblemen who had lent them- \u00a9 selves as tools to the jealousy of Richard, and had countenanced the more arbitrary transactions of his latter years. He satisfied himself with depriving them of the rank conferred on them for their subserviency to the royal will ; reducing the dukes of Albemarle, of Surrey, and of Exeter, the marquis of Dorset, and the earl of Gloucester, to their former titles as earls of Rutland, of Kent, of Huntingdon, and of Somerset, and Baron le Despenser. * from which it will appear that he was sprung from Henry III., both by father and mother.

But the duke of Gaunt, the father of Henry, was junior not only to the Black Prince, the parent of Richard II., but also to Lionel, the duke of Clarence, whose progeny were, of course, nearer to the throne than the present occupant. As Lionel had no male issue, his possessions and claims fell to his daughter Philippa, who married Mortimer, earl of March, and representative of the powerful baron whose memory is loaded with the imputation of having murdered Edward II. The descen dants of that princess were unquestionably the true heirs to the crown, and their right, it appears, had been acknowledged by Par liament during the government of the late king ; but as her grandsons, at the deposition of Richard, were mere children, no opposition was made in their name to the preferment of the duke of Lancaster, who could wield the sceptre with a stronger hand.* These powerful subjects, long accustomed to violence and intrigue, soon entered into a conspiracy to precipitate Henry from the throne to which similar machinations had raised him. They resolved, under pretence of holding a tournament at Oxford, to assemble a large body of their retainers, and by a sudden movement to seize the person of the king at Windsor ; which, being accomplished, it appears to have been their intention to proclaim Richard, over whose fate some degree of obscurity con tinued to hang. But the treachery of Rutland saved the usurper, who, having received timely notice, repaired to London, and placed himself at the head of a consider able army. The insurgents retreated towards the west, in the hope of being able to raise a force equal to that arrayed under the royal banners ; but the activity of the pursuers The beginning of Henry's reign was deeply agitated by the animosities which still prevailed among the nobles. A strong party adhered, though in secret, to the legitimate heir of the monarchy ; many were dissatisfied with the harsh treatment measured out to Richard ; and not a few trembled for their own safety, on account of the share which they had taken in the prosecution of the duke of Gloucester. No * Dr- Lingard (vol. iv. p 309) remarks that Henry \"could not claim by his father's side, because the young earl of March was sprung from the duke of Clarence, the elder brother of Jobn of Ghent ; nor by his mother's side, because she was sprung from Edmund of Lancaster, a younger brother of Edward I \" * Rot.

At Cirencester the populace rose against Kent and Salisbury, whom they forthwith put to death.

Having obtained from the peers, spiritual and temporal, grants of money and service, he summoned all the inferior retainers of his crown to meet him at York, with men and arms proportioned to the amount of their fees. From Newcastle he sent a messenger to the Scottish king and barons, commanding them to appear before him in the castle of Edinburgh on the 23rd of August next ensuing, to do homage for their respective fiefs. To this injunction the duke of Rothesay, the eldest son of Robert, replied by a proposal to decide the quarrel on equal terms, selecting a number of knights on each side who should represent in the field the interest of the two countries. As might be expected, Henry treated with contempt the expedient thus suggested by the youthful prmce, and resolved to await the approach of their main force before he commenced an attack, although he was already in the heart of their kingdom. But the duke of Albany, who commanded in the name of his brother, had too much prudence to risk an action with the invaders, who, he was aware, would soon be compelled to retreat for want of provisions ; and accord ingly, at no distant period, he had the satisfaction to see them retire within their own borders, without having accomplished anything worthy of the expense and ostenta tion with which the expedition had been undertaken. It has, however, been remarked by all the historians who have thought it necessary to record this event, that the English monarch acquired by his conduct a high reputation for humanity and justice, and more especially by the care which he took to protect the peaceful inhabitants from plunder and insult.t. This was the last invasion of Scotland conducted in person by an English monarch. The king of France, who had betrothed his daughter to Richard, was inclined to revenge his death by attacking the posses sions of the English on the Continent, and even by contesting in a wider field the title of his successor to the throne which he had ascended. But the unsettled state of his own affairs soon induced Charles to lay aside his preparations, and to acquiesce in the arrangements by which Guienne and the other dependencies of the English throne were included in the dominions pronounced hereditary in the person of the prince of Wales. The gallant son of Henry, at the accession of his father, had been created Duke of Guienne, and declared in Parliament heir-apparent to the throne ; measures which, however offensive they might be to the French sovereign, were not formally opposed by him. He was satisfied with the restora tion of the princess, his daughter, to her native land, together with the jewels which had been bestowed upon her when she left it;f but Henry meanly refused to return the sum of \u00a3200,000 in gold, which had been paid as part of the lady's dowry. To withdraw the thoughts of men from the murder of Richard, who is supposed to have been despatched in the Castle of Pon tefract early in the present year, as well as to give employment to those unruly spirits whose gain or pastime was connected with war, Henry resolved to lead an army into Scotland. His avowed intention was to punish the borderers for the incursions which they were incessantly making into his northern counties, and by means of which they not only brought his govern- The powerful earl of March, whose great estates lay near the borders, was at this time at open feud with the Scottish government. * Walsingham, p. 404, edit. 1574. f Uymer, vol. viii. p. 108. t Fordun, lib. xv. c. 11.

In this extremity a gallant Scotch knight named Sir John Swinton exclaimed, \" My brave fellow soldiers, what fascinates you to-day, that you stand like deer or fawns in a park to be shot, instead of showing your ancient valour and meeting your foes hand to hand ? Let those who will descend with me, and in the name of the Lord we wdl break that host and conquer, or if not, at least die with honour like soldiers.\"! Fol- lowed by a body of a hundred horsemen, Sir John and Sir Adam Gordon, another border chief, charged fiercely on the enemy, but were overpowered and slain. Douglas then descended the hill at the head of his men-at-arms, and made a desperate effort to retrieve the day. But he fell from his horse wounded in five places, and was taken prisoner, and this disaster completed the rout of his army. Along with Douglas, Murdoch the son of the duke of Albany, the earls of Moray and Angus, and eighty nobles and knights, fell into the bands of the enemy; while Swinton, Gordon, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Walter Sinclair, Livingston of Callender, Ramsay of Dalhousie, and many other barons, with eight hundred of the common soldiers, were left on the field, and five hundred were drowned while attempting to cross the Tweed in their flight. This victory was gained (14th September, 1402) entirely by the English archers; the knights and squires and men-at-arms scarcely couched a lance or drew a sword, f While his barons were thus victorious in the north, Henry was engaged in an attempt, much less successful, to suppress an insur- His daughter Elizabeth had been affianced to the duke of Rothesay, heir-apparent to the Scottish throne ; but through the influ ence of the duke of Albany, his uncle, the contract was set aside, and the young prince was married to the daughter of the earl of Douglas, the hereditary enemy of the house of March. Indignant at this scandalous breach of faith, the earl renounced his alle giance to the Scottish king, and retired into England. His estates, together with his strong fortress of Dunbar, were immediately seized by the Douglases. An opportunity of taking signal vengeance for his many wrongs soon presented itself to March. A body of Scots commanded by Hepburn of Hailes crossed the border in June, 1402, and pene trated far into Northumberland, laying waste the country in their usual manner. But they were intercepted on their return by the earl of March and the celebrated Hot spur at West Nesbit, near Dunse, and after a fierce conflict they were defeated with the loss of their leader and many of his men. Incensed at this disaster, Douglas collected an army of ten thousand men, and invaded England, wasting and burning the country as far as the gates of Newcastle, without meeting any force to oppose him. But the earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur, along with the earl of March, had collected a powerful army, and marched to intercept the Scots on their return to their own country, when laden with booty and lulled into careless security. On reaching Wooler, Douglas suddenly learned that this force was posted near Milfield, and barred his retreat. He immediately drew up his men on a neighbouring eminence, called Homil don Hill. But though Douglas, whose repeated defeats procured him the surname of \" Tyne-man \" or Lose-man, possessed the hereditary courage of his race, his errors as a general were numerous and grave. The position occupied by his troops was com pletely commanded by an eminence in front, of which the enemy were allowed to take undisturbed possession.

He was the great-grandson, by the mother's side, of Llewelyn, the last prince of Wales. He received a liberal education, studied at one of the inns of court in London, and was admitted to the English bar. He appears, however, to have soon abandoned the legal profession, and was appointed an esquire in the household of Richard II. He was mar ried at an early age to Margaret, daughter of Sir David Hanmer, one of the justices of the King's Bench, and received the honour of knighthood in 1387. Owen was strongly attached to his royal master, and followed his fading fortunes to the last. He was taken prisoner with Richard at Flint castle, and on the deposition of that monarch retired to his patrimonial estate in Wales. He was not permitted, however, long to remain in retirement. His property closely adjoined the estates of Lord Grey de Ruthyn, a powerful and unscrupulous baron, who, taking advantage of the fall of Richard and the weakness of his neighbour, unjustly despoiled him of a part of his inheritance. Owen complained to the Parliament of this outrage, but though supported by the bishop of St. Asaph, he obtained no redress. Fol lowing up injury with insult, De Ruthyn kept back the writ summoning Glendwr to repair with the other barons to the standard df Henry IV. in his expedition against the Scots, and then accused the Welsh chief of disobedience to the royal mandate, and seized his lands under pretence of forfeiture. Owen, provoked beyond endurance by these outrages, took up arms to vindicate his rights, expeUed the intruders from his estate, took some of them prisoners, and in retaliation seized upon the lands of his enemy Lord Grey during the summer of 1400. declared himself the avenger of the wrongs of his countrymen. The Welsh, who had suffered severely from the tyranny of their English oppressors, were now ripe for revolt and burning with the remembrance of their wrongs, and they flocked in great numbers to the standard of Glendwr. Their re doubted leader was not only one of the boldest and most enterprising warriors of his age, but he had pretensions to the pos session of magical powers, which made him more an object of dread than even his undoubted skill and valour. The bards, whom Glendwr patronized and liberally rewarded, and who had great influence among the people, zealously espoused his cause, and with the help of certain old Welsh prophecies induced the superstitious mountaineers to believe that Glendwr was gifted with supernatural skill, and was the dragon who, as Merlin predicted, was to destroy King Henry, \" themoldwarp accursed of God's own wrath.\" The insurrection soon became so formidable that the king \u00a9 was obliged to march against the insurgents in person. But Glendwr displayed great military knowledge of the resources of the country, and ultimately compelled them to retreat, worn out by privations and the want of provisions. \" Through art-magic,\" says Holinshed, \" he caused such foul weather of winds, tempest, rain, snow, and hail to be raised for the annoyance of the king's army, that the like had not been heard of. A free pardon offered to the insurgents induced thirty-two of Glendwr's principal adherents to desert his cause; but the in domitable chief himself ravaged the estates of the Anglo-Norman barons, captured the castle of Radnor, plundered and destroyed several towns. Roused by these excesses, Henry undertook a second expedition into Wales in 1401, but was again obliged to withdraw his troops, exhausted by famine and disease. In the following year Glendwr, encouraged by the appearance of a comet, which was regarded by the bards as a favourable omen, once more took the field, drew his old enemy Lord Grey into an When King Henry returned from his north ern expedition he proclaimed the Welsh chief an outlaw; and he, on the other hand, boldly laid claim to the sovereignty of Wales, and"], [370, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 332 [a.d. 1402. lowed the landing of the duke of Lancaster at Ravenspur, no doubt conceived that they had corresponding claims upon his gratitude now that he occupied the throne, while the sense of obligation was felt burdensome by the king, who could not acknowledge to his powerful subjects the full extent of his debt without at the same time confessing the o defects of his title, and the weight still attached to their name. When, therefore, their smouldering resentment was inflamed by Henry's ungracious refusal to allow Mortimer's kinsmen to treat with Glendwr for his ransom, though he had readily granted permission to the relatives of Lord Grey de Ruthyn to purchase his liberty, Hotspur vowed that he would be revenged on the monarch who had repaid the services of his family with such marked ingratitude. ambush, took him prisoner, and compelled him as the price of his release to pay ten thousand marks and to marry Jane, his fourth daughter. Owen then turned his arms against the Welsh adherents of the \u00a9 English king, blockaded Carnarvon, and destroyed the cathedral of Bangor and the canons' houses, with the palace and cathedral of St. Asaph. Shortly after, in 1402, Glendwr defeated Sir Edmund Mor timer near Knighton, in Radnorshire, with the loss of eleven hundred men, whose bodies were shockingly mutilated by the Welsh female camp followers. A third campaign undertaken by Henry himself in person proved a complete failure. Advanc ing from Shrewsbury in the end of Septem ber, he divided his forces into three separate bodies, which entered Wales at three differ ent points ; but his active and wary adversary continually evaded his pursuit, and was thought to have entered into a league with the invisible powers of the air. The royal troops were distressed with incessant rains, which inundated the valleys, made the mountain streams impassable, and even swept away the king's tent. Henry at last was compelled to quit the principality com pletely baffled; and Owen, marching in triumph through the country, was every where acknowledged by the Welsh as their legitimate sovereign. The earl of Northumberland very natu rally shared the discontent of his son, in which he was soon joined by the earl of Worcester, his brother, as well as by Scroop, the archbishop of York ; the latter of whom had never given his sanction to the usurped government, nor ceased to regret the injus tice inflicted upon the children of Philippa. These powerful nobles formed a close league with Glendwr, whose daughter Mor timer had married, and entered into a con spiracy to depose Henry. The confederates held a meeting in the house of the dean of Bangor, a stanch supporter of Glendwr, and agreed to divide the kingdom among themselves. The confederacy soon acquired great strength, and obtained the aid of some very able leaders. Douglas, in return for the gift of freedom, mustered a large body of his warlike followers; Glendwr, whose enmity to the House of Lancaster required no additional stimulant, prepared to bring into the field all the disposable force of Wales, of which at this juncture he was formally crowned prince; while the uncle of Hotspur advanced from Chester at the head of a chosen band of archers devoted to the same cause. The confederates havino issued a manifesto against the king, in which they charged him with rank favouritism The capture of Sir Edmund Mortimer by Glendwr led indirectly to a combination between the Welsh chieftain and the earls of Northumberland, Worcester, and Douglas, which had very nearly hurled the king from his unstable throne. Sir Edmund was uncle to the young earl of March, the lawful heir to the crown, and brother-in-law of Hotspur; and Henry's refusal to allow Mortimer to be ransomed had roused the indignation of the powerful family of the Percys, and he had increased their resentment by an order for bidding them to set at liberty or put to ransom the prisoners taken in the battle of Homildon Hill. The earl of Northumber land and his gallant son, having taken a principal part in the campaign which fol-"], [371, "A.d. 1403.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 333 and a lavish expenditure of the public money, directed their march towards the Welsh frontier, where they expected a formidable addition to their armament.* noblemen to wear the royal arms; his friends being convinced that the main attack would be made on that part of the line in which the king was supposed to have taken his position. This stratagem, fatal to those who were appointed to carry it into execution, saved the monarch's life and secured a vic tory. Douglas and Percy, esteemed two of the bravest knights in Christendom, rushed into the centre of the enemy, followed by thirty of their most trusty attendants ; slew every one who personated the king; bent the royal standard to the ground, and even inflicted a wound on the gallant prince of Wales. But in the height of their career, an arrow pierced the brain of Hotspur, who feU dead on the spot ; dismay seized the hearts of his men, who had already suffered severely from the steady valour of their opponents, and confusion instantly prevailed throughout all their ranks to such a degree that neither exhortation nor example could induce them to keep their ground. The loss sustained by both parties was very great ; but that on the side of the vanquished was not a little increased by the executions which followed. Lords Worcester and Kinderston, as well as Sir Richard Vernon, were condemned to undergo the punish ment of traitors.* Douglas, who was much hurt by a fall over a precipice, was taken prisoner, but was treated as a foreign knight and kindly entertained. Henry, whose preparations had not been neglected, resolved to anticipate their move ments, and to prevent the meditated junc tion with Owen, whose troops were already flushed with repeated victories. He pushed on in the same direction, and entered Shrews bury at the very moment at which the in surgents came within sight of its walls; an occurrence which so far disconcerted Percy that he found it necessary to fall back upon Hartlefield until he should make ready for battle. But before an appeal was made to arms, recourse was had to a ceremony not unfrequently employed in those remote times when the hostilities of princes were regu lated in some degree by the same principles which determined the practice of private combats. According to the laws of chivalry it was deemed proper to inform the king of the grounds on which he was to be assailed by the opposing host ; and this not only as being regarded in the light of a usurper, but also as a false and perjured knight. After stating six counts, as the leading O I \u00a9 facts of their charge, the confederates con clude as follows : \u2014 \"For these reasons we do mortally defy thee and thy accomplices and adherents, as traitors, and subverters of the commonwealth and kingdom, and invaders, oppressors, and usurpers of the rights of the true and direct heir of England and France ; and! we intend to prove it this day by force of arms with the aid of Almighty God.\"f The earl of Northumberland, who was conducting a body of troops into the west to aid his son, no sooner received the mel ancholy intelligence of his death than he returned to his residence at Warkworth and dismissed his followers. He afterwards repaired to York at the command of the king, who insisted upon an explanation of some ambiguous steps which appeared to indicate a participation in the late treason extinguished with so much blood on the plains of Shrewsbury. The earl disavowed all knowledge of the designs meditated by the rebels ; asserted that they had acted in On the next morning, the 21st of July, 1403, was fought one of the most obstinate and bloody battles recorded in the domestic history of England. The armies, nearly equal in number, amounted to not less than fourteen thousand men on each side, and were commanded by chiefs whose skill as generals was hardly inferior to their courage as individual combatants. Henry was advised to change his dress, and to permit several * Rymer, vol. viii. p. 313. Walsingham, p. 409. t Hereditary Right of the Crown, from Harleian MS. Lin- * Otterbourne, p. 242.

It was, how ever, decided by Parliament that, although innocent of the highest offence against the crown, he was guilty of a misdemeanour, for which he might justly be fined. Henry, affecting a confidence which he did not feel, pardoned the offender, on condition that he should swear fealty to him, to the prince of Wales, to his other sons, and their heirs.* that he had never intended evil \"against the person of king Henry,\" The king him self advanced against Northumberland ; but the latter, sensible that he could not suc cessfully resist an army of thirty thousand well-trained soldiers, retired into Scotland. At the same time he entered into a corre spondence with the duke of Orleans, who, he hoped, would be able to interest the French court in his favour. In his despatches to that prince, he said that \" he has levied war against Henry of Lancaster, the ruler of England, to support the quarrel of his sovereign lord, the king Richard, if he is alive, and to revenge his death, if he be dead ; and also to support the right quarrel which his dread lady the queen of England may reasonably have to the kingdom of England.\"* But Northumberland could not shut his ears to any proposal which might have for its object the disturbance of a sovereign whom he hated, and by whose ascendancy his own family had been greatly depressed. In 1405, accordingly, Lord Bardolf and others, who had opposed the measures of the king in a great council held at St. Alban's, repaired to the earl in the north, in order to concert with him the operations of another confederacy. The archbishop of York, who had never acknowledged the right of Henry, and had even exhorted him to repent of his treason to Richard and to place the young earl of March on the throne, readily entered into the views of the dis affected. Eight thousand men obeyed the summons of these leaders, and appeared in the field near Shipton, where they seemed disposed to await the approach of the royal lieutenants, the earl of Westmoreland and Prince John. But, through their own simplicity and the base treachery of West moreland, they were persuaded to disband their forces, on the solemn assurance that the king would grant them the redress of their grievances. In spite of this compact the leaders of the insurgents were seized by the earl and carried to the king, who caused the archbishop and Nottingham to be imme diately executed without any indictment, trial, or defence. This was the first in stance in England of the infliction of capital punishment upon a prelate. Scroop met his illegal fate with great courage and com posure, protesting to the last that he had merely wanted a redress of grievances, and But Scotland was too weak and France too distant to supply any effectual aid to the cause of the confederates. Nor was the vigilance of Henry ever so much deceived as to allow any material advantage to be gained by his enemies, whether on the nor thern border or on the Welsh marches; on both of which, able officers were appointed to watch their movements and to punish their aggressions, wherever they might assemble in sufficient strength to alarm the public peace. It was not till the beginning of 1408 that Northumberland, accompanied by Lord Bardolf, entered his native country, seized several strongholds, collected his friends and tenantry, and invited to his standard all who wished to see the lawful monarch on the throne, and the death of the archbishop revenged. Having proceeded as far as Knaresborough, he received a con siderable accesssion to his undisciplined bands by the junction of Sir Nicholas Tempest, a decided partizan of the fallen prelate. But his motions were all the while strictly watched by Sir Thomas Rokeby, who having under his charge a body of veterans on whose dispositions he could rely, attacked the earl near Tadcaster, completely routed his tumultuous host, slew \u2022 Rot.

The limbs of these noble men were exposed in the principal cities of the kingdom ; while the heavy fines which were imposed on their adherents replenished the exchequer of the victorious prince, and by weakening as well as disheartening his foes, materially fortified his government at home and abroad.* his afflicted relative. The boy James was kept as a pledge for the subserviency of the duke, who, it was presumed, would not give offence to the ruler of England so long as the latter could, at his pleasure, remove him from the throne, by setting at liberty the rightful heir. It has been imagined, too, by those who have believed that Richard II. was still alive and in the custody of the Scottish court, that a compromise was estab lished between Henry and the northern regent, in virtue of which each was bound to retain the royal captive, whom accident had thrown into his power. Whatever truth may be in these insinuations, it is due to the memory of the English king to mention, that he conferred upon the son of Robert III. an excellent education, which would, no doubt, have qualified him to soften the barbarous manners of his native country, had it not at the same time inspired him with too much contempt for the rude barons, without whose aid he could not possibly govern the still more unculti vated people. His premature attempts at reform were the principal cause of his melancholy fate. Shortly before his final triumph over the nor thern insurgents, Henry obtained possession in a very dishonourable manner of the per son of James, son of King Robert III., heir apparent to the Scottish throne. David, duke of Rothesay, elder son of Robert, had been imprisoned by his uncle Albany in Falkland castle, and had died there of dysentery, as it was given out by Albany and his friends ; but according to the general belief at the time the unfortunate prince was starved to death by his uncle's orders. f The aged and feeble king of Scotland, becoming appre hensive for the safety of his only remaining son James, now in his fourteenth year, resolved to send him for a season to France, as the surest means of protecting him from the intrigues of his ambitious and unprinci pled uncle. The vessel in which the young Prince had embarked was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser; and thourrh a truce at that time subsisted between the kingdoms, James and his at tendants were carried to London (13th March, 1405), and committed to the Tower. Deaf to aU remonstrances and considerations of justice and honour, Henry, in flagrant violation of the law of nations, refused to restore the prince to liberty. This new disaster completely broke the spirit of the poor old king of Scotland, and he died in the course of the following year (4th April, 1406), as it was commonly believed, of a broken heart. In the open rivalry for power which at this time took place between the dukes of Burgundy and of Orleans, the king of England embraced the party of the former ; and on espousing the widowed duchess of Brittany, he gave his full aid and consent to a negotiation which transferred the tutelage of her son and of his dominions \u00a9 to the hands of Burgundy. The duke of Orleans, irritated by this large increase of power accruing to his competitor, lost no opportunity of manifesting his spleen against the king of England ; and Monstrelet has preserved a correspondence in which Louis proposes a combat to Henry, with a hun dred knights and esquires on each side. The antagonists were to pledge themselves not to employ any incantations forbidden by the church ; their arms were to be lance, battle-axe, sword, and dagger ; and they were to forswear all undue advantage which might be obtained by any \"bodkins, The object of the detention of the young prince, apparently so unworthy of a great sovereign, appeared when Albany, as regent, assumed the government on the demise of * Walsingham, p 410.

The bravado, however, was imitated by the Count de St. Sol, who had married a half-sister of Richard II* hooks, bearded darts, poisoned hooks, or razors.\"* Henry expressed surprise at the cartel ; first, because it involved a breach of the national truce ; and, secondly, because it violated a solemn private covenant of brotherhood and alliance formerly sworn between the duke of Orleans and himself, which covenant he now therefore renounced, throwing aside henceforward all love and affection. Although he declined the pro posed challenge with one hundred knights as unfitting the dignity of a sovereign prince, he intimated that whenever he should cross to his continental dominions, \" should it please God, our Lady, and my Lord St. George,\" the duke of Orleans would find him ready for a personal combat, to prevent any greater effusion of Christian blood. Pretending that it was his especial duty to avenge the death of his brother-in-law, he sent his heralds into England with a cartel of defiance to the usurper. After stating the affinity, love, and confederation which existed between him and Richard, of whose murder it was notorious that Henry duke of Lancaster, as this document styled him, was accused, the count proceeded to inform the English monarch that he would do him harm in every way in his power, and offer every kind of injury, by himself, his rela tions, his men, and his subjects, both by sea and land, \" without the kingdom of France; and all this for his own personal reasons, and not on account of any war between the king of France and the realm of England.\" The defiance of this petty prince, who assumed the double character of a vassal of France and an independent prince of the empire, was of course treated with contempt by Henry, and when the count actually took to the sea in 1403 for the purpose of carrying out his threats, his operations resembled those of a pirate rather than of a sove reign prince. Two letters which succeeded were marked by little courtesy. Henry had objected to an informality of address in the first com munication, to which charge the duke of Orleans replied, that although he had not written to his adversary as king of England, he had nevertheless addressed him by the name which he had received at the font, and by which he had been always called during the lifetime of his parents. He then more than insinuated that Henry had been guilty of murdering the predecessor whom he had treasonably dethroned. The king of England's answer might be conformable to the usages of chivalry ; but it sounds roughly in modern ears, especially when we call to mind that it proceeded from a throne. \" When you return thanks to those of your family for having felt more pity than we have done for our king and sove reign liege lord, we reply that by the honour of God, of our Lady, and of my Lord St. George, when you say so you lie falsely and wickedly. We tell you that you lie, and will falsely lie every time you assert it.\" The chronicler continues to inform us that notwithstanding this angry correspond ence, the king of England and the duke of Orleans never personally met, and the During the greater part of Henry's reign France was torn by internal dissensions, which its insane and helpless monarch was utterly unable to restrain. A fierce civd war repeatedly broke out between the duke of Orleans the king's brother, and the duke of Burgundy his cousin, during which the most revolting excesses were perpetrated by the partizans of both nobles. In November, 1407, a temporary reconciliation took place, and expressions of cordial friendship were interchanged. But a few days later the duke of Orleans was murdered in the streets of Paris by a band of assassins employed by his rival and relation the duke of Burgundy, who openly avowed the deed a few days later. Such was the degraded state of moral seeling at this period that this foul and * Mon.^lrelet, vol. i. c 9. * Monstrclet, vol. i. c. 10."], [375, "a.d 1408-1411.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 337 treacherous murder excited but little horror ; and though the murderer was obliged to withdraw to Flanders on the discovery of his crime, he speedily returned to France in order, as he said, to justify the course which he had pursued ; and his foul crime was publicly vindicated before the royal council by John Petit, professor of theology in the university of Paris, the most cele brated orator of his time. On the third day after the harangue of this divine the duke of Burgundy received a letter of pardon under the king's own hand and seal, and he speedily usurped the entire control of public affairs. addressed a memorial to the king demanding punishment on his father's murderer, and formal letters of defiance were interchanged o between him and Burgundy. The capital was in the hands ofthe Burgundians, and was at tbe mercy of the powerful corporation of the butchers, who were devoted partizans of the duke ; while the Armagnacs inflicted great cruelties in the provinces, and ad vanced with a powerful force to assault Paris. Lust, pillage, treachery, and murder raged alike both without and within the walls; and while the suburban districts were ravaged by the Gascon soldiery, the rabble plundered and murdered the more wealthy citizens without mercy or restraint. During the absence of the duke in Flan ders for the purpose of quelling a revolt of his subjects there (June, 1408), an unsuc cessful attempt was made by the queen, assisted by some of the princes of the blood, to take tbe reins of government into her own hands. But on the return to Paris of Burgundy, victorious from the ferocious battle of Hasbaen, in which twenty-four thousand of the citizens of Liege were slain, the queen was obliged to yield, and fled to Tours, carrying with her the helpless king. An apparent reconciliation was effected between the two parties, which lasted only about four months. The assistance of England was coveted and privately sought by both parties ; and the duke of Burgundy, as the price of an alliance with the English monarch, tendered the hand of one of his daughters to the prince of Wales. Henry was reluctant to pledge himself to either party; yet in the hope of weakening France by fomenting her domestic quarrels, he despatched eight hundred lances and a thousand of his best bowmen, more to observe than to assist the Burgundians. The duke, strengthened by this reinforce ment, hurried on by a forced march to Paris, which he entered in October, 1411, unop posed by any of the numerous bands employed in its investment, and was wel comed by the citizens as the deliverer of France. A body of the Armagnacs were attacked and defeated by him with the loss of twelve hundred of their number, and the remainder of their force made a speedy retreat to the province on the upper Loire. The duke of Burgundy marched against them, and laid siege to Bourges, which had become the centre of the party. But he had not shown any marked gratitude for the assistance he had received from England, and besides, it did not suit the policy of Henry that one of the factions should be allowed to crush the other. He therefore lent a ready ear to the overtures which were now made to him by the Armagnacs. Their Charles, the young duke of Orleans, had recently become a widower by the death of Isabella, daughter of the French king and widow of Richard II. of England, and he now took for his second wife Bona, daughter of Bernard, count of Armagnac, one of the most powerful nobles in France. His per sonal bravery, activity, and great military experience eminently fitted him for com mand ; and as his son-in-law was young and inexperienced, the count became the leader ofthe Orleans party, who were thence desig nated Armagnacs, a name memorable in French history. The dukes of Berri and Brittany and the count of Alencon now joined the Orleanist faction, and shortly after recourse was once more had to arms. The young duke of Orleans, in the name of his whole family, 43"], [376, "[a.d. 1412. 338 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. leaders the dukes of Berri, Orleans, and Bourbon, with the count of Alencon, in May, 1412, agreed to acknowledge the English monarch as lawful duke of Aqui taine, to assist him to recover all the rights and appurtenances of that duchy, to hold of him by homage all the lands they pos sessed within its limits, and to give security that the counties of Poictou and Angouleme should be restored to him on the death of their present possessors. Henry, on his part, agreed to assist his new allies in every just quarrel, to enter into no treaty with the duke of Burgundy without their consent, and to send to their assistance one thousand men-at-arms and three thousand archers. the chronicler, evil tongues were not spar ing of them behind their backs, but loudly spake their minds about this reconciliation. At this juncture an English army, under the command of the duke of Clarence, second son of Henry IV., landed in Nor mandy, and were joined by Count Alencon and some other nobles. It had been stipulated in the late treaty that the Armagnacs were to break off their alliance with the English ; and they lost no time in sending a deputation to the duke of Clarence to inform him that as they had made peace with their opponents, the Burgundians, they no longer required his assistance, and that he might return home. The duke was naturally dissatisfied with this arrangement, and demanded payment of the expenses of the expedition. As the money was not forthcoming, the English soldiers began to plunder the country, and marched through Normandy into Maine. Another division at the same time issued from Calais, and occupied the greater part of Artois. The two lately reconcded factions threw upon each other the burden of raising funds to pay the expenses of the English ; but the exchequer was empty, and no money was forthcoming till the duke of Clarence marched from Maine through Anjou, and threatened to overrun the duchy of Orleans. To avert this invasion, the duke of Orleans hastened to the head quarters of the English, carrying with him all the money he could raise. It was arranged that the French prince should take upon him the payment of the whole cost of the expedition, and that his brother, the duke of Angouleme, should be placed in the hands of the English as security. As soon as this arrangement was made, the duke of Clarence caused his soldiers to cease their depredations ; but he continued his march for Guienne, and reached Bordeaux in safety, having traversed the whole of France with an army which did not exceed eight thousand men. The proposed dismemberment ofthe mon archy was speedily brought to the knowledge of the duke of Burgundy by the intercep tion of his enemies' despatches, and the disclosure excited very general indignation. Some of the leaders of the two factions were not so far blinded by party spirit as not to see the injurious influence which this alliance wdth England was fitted to exercise on the welfare of their own country. Various meetings and consultations were held, and at length a conference was held outside the walls of Bourges between the duke of Berri and the duke of Burgundy his nephew. A reconciliation took place between them, and a treaty of peace was soon after signed at Auxerre, by which it was agreed that the Armagnacs should submit to the royal authority, and that the past should be for gotten ; that without any distinction the adherents of both parties should be left in the enjoyment of their liberties and their property ; and that, as additional security, the duke of Burgundy should give one of his daughters in marriage to the count of Versus, the younger son of the duke of Orleans whom he murdered. As a public manifestation of their perfect reconciliation, the dukes of Burgundy and the young duke of Orleans rode together mounted on the same horse. Monstrelet mentions that the simple people at this sight shouted with joy, and sang Gloria in excelsis; but, adds Notwithstanding his good fortune, how ever, and the success of his generals, Henry"], [377, "A.D. 1105-1412.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 339 was doomed throughout his whole reign to experience the full weight of that anxiety and suspicion which are inseparable from the thrones of usurpers. At one time the country was greatly agitated by the pretensions of an individual who personated the late king Richard, counterfeited his privy seal, and despatched letters in his name to the friends of the deposed monarch throughout England. The fraud was de tected, and Serle the author of the plot, as wed as Ward, who condescended to act the part of a puppet, was condignly punished. Nor was the indignation of Henry con fined to those who had taken an actual share in this imposture ; he visited with great severity a number of clergymen likewise, who had dared to express their conviction that Richard was still alive.* ment. His character gave probability to the imputation, which his royal master was more in haste to punish than to prove ; and, accordingly, Rutland, now duke of York, was stripped of his estates and thrown into prison.* The insurrection of the Welsh was still unsuppressed. Three times the king in person took the field against the redoubt able Glendwr ; but notwithstanding the skill and valour which always accompanied his standard, he could make no impression on the Welsh chief, and was each time repulsed and baffled by the fiery courage of the insurgents, aided by the strength of their native fastnesses and the inclemency of the weather. Prince Henry, however, was more successful than his father, and in March, 1405, inflicted a severe defeat upon the Welsh at Grosmont castle, about twelve miles from Monmouth, and a second time during the same month at a place in Breck nockshire, where one of Glcndwr's sons was captured, and his brother Tudor killed. The indomitable chief was now reduced to such extremity, that he was obliged to lurk with a few faithful adherents in the most unfre quented parts of the country, and to hide for some time in a cave in Merionethshire, where he was secretly maintained by an old and trusty friend. In the preceding year he had applied for assistance to the French court. The king of France, who could not be supposed averse to any project likely to distract the affairs of England, received Owen's ambassadors as those of a legitimate ruler, and entering into a treaty with him, engaged to send whatever assistance in troops the exigencies of the Welsh chief might require. This promised assistance was given at a most opportune season, when the for tunes of Glendwr were reduced to a low ebb by the repeated victories of Prince Henry in It has been already noticed that Henry retained at Windsor in a state of honourable captivity the young earl of March and his brother, without presuming to question by any direct means the right of the former to the throne. Among the charges brought against this sovereign by the Percys, on the eve of the battle of Shrewsbury, they failed not to complain of the cruel policy by which the heir to the crown, the lawful king of England, was kept in confinement, and deprived of the high privileges to which his birth entitled him. In the beginning of 1405, the widow ofthe Lord Despenser, who had fallen a victim to the popular rage at Bristol, undertook to procure liberty for the two princes, by obtaining false keys to the division of the\u00bbpalace in which they were immured. The youthful fugitives, who had turned their faces towards the borders of Wales, were soon retaken and consigned to their wonted apartments ; upon which the lady, either to palliate her own guilt, or to alarm the mind of the jealous monarch, accused her brother, the notorious earl of Rutland, of having instigated the attempt, in which she had only acted as an instru- \u2022 Rymer, vol. viii. p. 386.

But Prince Henry gradu- ally gained ground and drove his adversary from one stronghold to another among the mountains, whence he suddenly sallied out, and gratified his revenge by attacking the outposts and convoys of the English. It is said that Owen was sometimes obliged to disguise himself in the habit of a shepherd. Some three or four years after the departure of his French allies, a party of his adherents, while engaged in ravaging Shropshire, were defeated, and their leaders, Rhys-ap-Dher and Philip Scudamore, Owen's son-in-law, were taken prisoners and executed in Lon- don as traitors. The last glimpse we obtain of this redoubtable chief is in 1416, when Henry V. commissioned Sir Gilbert Talbot to treat with Meredith, Glendwr's son, offer- ing a free pardon to his father and his adherents if they should submit to the royal authority \u2014 terms which were offered a second time six months later, shortly after the battle of Agincourt. It is probable that the patriot died about this time, it is alleged in the house of one of his daughters, who had married a wealthy knight of Herefordshire ; and there is a tombstone in the churchyard of Mornington, in that county, which is believed to mark his grave. His enthu- siastic, impetuous, irascible, yet generous disposition and gallant spirit, have been strikingly portrayed by Shakespeare in his Henry IV., and the memory of the daring exploits of this last champion of the indepen dence of Wales lingers to this day among the mountain peasantry of his native district. Prince Henry had hitherto watched the invaders, unable to arrest their progress, but at this place he was joined by his father at the head of a powerful army. The French and Welsh took up a strong position a few miles from Worcester, and Henry encamped on a hill opposite, with a deep valley be tween him and the enemy. For eight suc cessive days and nights the hostile armies, arrayed in order of battle, maintained their respective positions ; but though there were repeated skirmishes, in which, among others, a brother of the French marshal and two other great lords were slain, no general engagement took place, as neither were willing to quit their vantage-ground. At last the allies were compelled by the want of supplies to abandon their position and to retire into Wales. King Henry followed them in their retreat, but became entangled among the woods and marshes, and was driven back with considerable loss. Mean while a number of the French ships in Mil ford Haven were burned by the English, and some others conveying stores and ammu nition were intercepted; and the invaders, heartily sick of the hardships and privations of Welsh warfare, returned to their own country in vessels which their ally had provided. The security of Henry's throne continued to be shaken, and the peace of the country disturbed, by reports industriously circulated that Richard was still alive, and that, having found refuge in Scotland, he was about to return at the head of a Scottish army to assert his rights. These rumours were credited by great numbers of the people, and associations were formed in various parts of the kingdom to promote the resto ration of the deposed monarch. It was in vain that Henry issued proclamation after proclamation against the fabricators of false The remainder of Glendwr's career is involved in considerable obscurity. Four years of unremitting hostilities were found to have exhausted the hopes as well as the means of a large proportion of the subordi nate leaders, who were gradually compelled to relinquish the dream of being able to support an independent throne.

They likewise adhered to the practice, introduced during former reigns, of not granting to the sovereign any supply until their petitions or bills, presented in Parliament, should have been carefully examined and formally answered. They interposed their authority, too, for the regulation of the royal house hold, desiring the king to dismiss from his service certain individuals at whom they had taken umbrage. Cotton enumerates thirty-one articles for the better conducting of the government and the domestic con cerns of the king, all of which the members of council, the judges, and the officers of the palace were compelled by oath to regard as obligatory. \" The archbishop of Canter bury, for himself and others, refused to swear, but offered to do what they might ; the king thereupon charged the same arch bishop, and others of the council, on their allegiance to take the oath, who took the same accordingly.\" They imitated, more over, the example of former Parliaments, by appointing treasurers to manage and account for the sums which they voted for the business of the state ; and, in short, they not only entertained that constitutional jealousy of the monarch which was identi fied with the love of freedom, but in their intercourse with the two higher estates of the realm they used such liberties of speech as could not fail to prove offensive. \" Thou mayest observe,\" says the author just quoted, \" that the Commons' young speaker in this Parliament took more upon him, spake more boldly and fervently unto the king and lords than any speaker did before him ; which beginning to grow into fashion, thereupon the king and lords, in the Parliament 13 Henry IV., put a check upon it as a novelty inconsistent with the king's prerogative, as thou mayest there perceive ; which made the speakers after wards more modest, and not to speak any thing that was displeasing to the king, and if they casually did, to pray it might be The reign of Henry did not pass without witnessing the progress of popular rights, as manifested by the spirit which from time to time prevailed in the House of Commons. The circumstances under which he ascended the throne compelled him to rely upon the support of the people, who showed a greater inclination to further the cause of liberty than to inquire into the abstract grounds of his title. In a particular manner they directed their vigilance to the remedy of an abuse in elections, which had crept in at an earlier period, and was continued by successive sovereigns. To secure the return of members favourable to the royal views, the influence of the crown was applied in a way which inflicted an insult while it undermined an essential privdege ; and among the charges brought against the unfortunate Richard, he was accused of adopting unwarrantable methods for pro curing to his partizans seats in the Lower House. Laws were enacted to prevent or punish this violation ofthe franchise, and on one occasion the sheriff of Rutland was com mitted to prison for making a false return.* The Commons, becoming daily more sen siBle of their own importance, began to exercise powers which, though conceded by the principles of the Constitution, had been very rarely assumed in the actual adminis tration of affairs.

We have just mentioned the articles sanctioned by him in the eighth year of his reign, and it will be found that they im plied a surrender of several points hitherto deemed essential to the prerogative of Eng lish monarchs. He was required to name sixteen counsellors, by whose advice he was to be solely guided, not having the power to dismiss any of them without a formal con viction of misdemeanour. The chancellor and privy seal were not to pass any grants, or other matters, contrary to law. It was agreed that any person about the court who might stir up the mind of the king or queen against their subjects, and be duly convicted thereof, should lose his office and be fined. The king's ordinary revenue was to be wholly appropriated to his household and to the payment of his debts ; no grant of ward ship, nor other advantages arising from that source, were to be conferred upon subjects ; nor was any forfeiture to be pardoned. The king, \" considering the wise government of other Christian princes, and conforming himself thereto,\" became bound to assign two days in the week for receiving petitions ; \" it being an honourable and necessary thing that his lieges who desire to petition should be heard.\" No judicial officer, nor any in the revenue or household, was to enjoy his place for life or for any fixed term of years. No person was, to be presented to the king by any of his household at times when the council was not sitting. It was provided that the council should not determine any thing which was cognizable at common law, unless for a reasonable cause, and with con sent ofthe judges. The statutes regulating purveyance were affirmed ; abuses of various kinds in the council, as well as in the courts of justice, were enumerated and forbidden ; In the sixth year of Henry, a Parliament assembled, which has been distinguished by the epithet of the \" unlearned,\" chiefly because lawyers of both faculties were rigorously excluded. The members, how ever, were not deficient either in zeal or in patriotism, proceeding at once to a resump tion of grants made by the crown, and prohibiting in future all alienation of the royal patrimony without the consent of the Commons. Their motives in taking such steps they declared to be no other than a desire to ease the people of taxes, and to enable the king to live upon his own. It was, indeed, a favourite object at this period to confine the expenditure of the sovereign to his hereditary or private revenue ; and Parliaments, accordingly, were very lavish in their exhortations on this rather invidious topic. On one occasion Henry commissioned the archbishop to acknowledge in his name that \" some things had been done amiss in his court and household,\" and to beseech the Lords that they would put the latter in order ; but when the other House pressed him to a still more rigid economy, he replied that he would do so as soon as it should be in his power.f This celebrated convention, known to posterity principally for the negative quality already mentioned, seems to have waged war with all the learned orders. Its mem bers suggested to the king that he should seize all the temporalities of the church, and convert them into a permanent fund to meet the ordinary wants of the state ; maintaining that the clergy possessed a third of all the lands in England, and that, while they con tributed nothing to the public burdens, the * Cotton, p. 429.

In reply to these observations, the archbishop of Canterbury remarked that the clergy contributed as much to the service of the monarch as the laity did, giving their tenths more frequently than the others gave their fifteenths ; and, besides, sending out in all cases of war and hazard a greater number of men than was supplied by the holders of lay estates. He added, that those of the priesthood who remained at home, offered up day and night masses and prayers for his Majesty and for all who were in his service. Here the speaker of the Commons indicated, by his looks and words, that he held the supplications of the church at a very low rate.* The popular party, how ever, failed in their object, as neither the king nor the peers would give consent to the meditated attack on the spiritual revenue. But though repulsed they were not dis couraged. Allowing two or three years to elapse they returned to the charge, being now supplied with a calculation of the whole income belonging to the church, which, they asserted, amounted to nearly five hundred thousand marks and eighteen thousand ploughs of land. They proposed that this immense rental should be applied to the maintenance of a certain number of tician. For that reason he threw over it the shield of royal power, now greatly augmented and confirmed, addressing to the Commons some very severe remarks on the intemperance and selfishness of their views, and expressing his determination to maintain at once his own prerogative, and the essential principles of the constitution on which it rested.* These assaults on the church are men tioned by only one historian, and doubts have therefore been entertained as to the correctness of the facts which he has re corded. But Walsingham, being a contem porary and a clergyman, enjoyed the best means of information, and was not likely to give credit to unfounded rumours against the body to which he belonged, hitherto regarded with so much reverence and for bearance; it being contrary to the interests of his order to preserve the memory of such transactions, much more to forge precedents which posterity might be ready to imitate. It has therefore been imagined that the silence of the records on this subject can be accounted for only by supposing the authority of some churchmen to have been so great as to have procured the erasure of those circumstances which the indiscretion of one of their number has fortunately pre served to us. f It would not be difficult to trace a con nection between the occurrence now stated new earls, knights, and squires, and also of a hundred hospitals, assuring the king that there would still be an annual surplus of twenty thousand pounds, which he might appropriate to his own use. But Henry, who now looked to the stability of the government, did not allow himself to be bribed into a measure which he deemed so injurious to the community, and so directly subversive of all the maxims on which pro- perty was either held or transmitted. The church, be considered, was the weakest of all corporations, so far as the perpetuity of its inheritance is concerned, and therefore was the most likely to be attacked by the reckless demagogue or the designing poli- and the doctrines of the Lollards. Treading \u00a9 in the steps of Wycliffe, they condemned all regular provision for the clergy, and lamented the increase of wealth as one of the main sources of professional corruption. The king was supposed to have inherited the partiality manifested by his father, the duke of Lancaster, in favour of the new opinions ; but his interests as a sovereign now indi cated to him a different line of policy, and he even lent a ready ear to those who were willing to identify heresy with a crime * Rymer, vol. viii. p. 027. t Hnme, vol. iii. p. 80.

Immediately after his accession, accordingly, he made known his resolution to protect the church against the designs of the preachers. He encouraged the priesthood to take measures for the sup pression of dangerous errors, and promised them whatever aid they might require in the pursuit of so important an object. Stimulated by this approbation communicated to the convocation by the royal commission ers, the earls of Northumberland and Erping ham, the prelates applied to Parliament for the enactment of such a statute as might defend the ecclesiastical estate against the designs of its enemies. Their wish was soon gratified by obtaining from the legis lature the first law passed in England for the punishment of heresy; and no long period intervened before it was put in force on the person of Santre, rector or chaplain of St. Osith, in London, who was burned alive in Smithfield in the beginning of March, 1401, in the presence of a vast mul titude, who crowded to witness a spectacle for the first time seen in England.* Many an unfortunate Lollard subsequently suffered for his faith under the house of Lancaster. greatest clerk that they then knew living;\" and, in spite of both threats and persuasions, resolutely refused to retract the opinions which he had taught. Some of the arch bishop's counsellors proposed that he should be burned, others that he should be drowned in the sea, which was near at hand. But he was at last led forth to what he calls \" a foul dishonest prison,\" where he had never been before. Thorpe's ultimate fate is uncertain, but it is probable that he died in his dungeon. The second victim known to have perished at the stake for his religion was John or Thomas Badby, called in some accounts a tailor, in others a smith, who was accused of a denial of the doctrine of transubstan tiation. After an examination by Arch bishop Arundel, he was burned at Smithfield (1st March, 1410), in a large tun surrounded with dry wood. \" The king's eldest son, the Lord Henry, prince of Wales, having been present,\" says Holinshed, \" offered him his pardon, first before the fire was kindled, if he would have recanted his opinions ; and after, when the fire was kindled, hearing him make a roaring noise very pitifully, the prince caused the fire to be plucked back, and exhorted him, being with pitiful pain almost dead, to remember himself and renounce his opinions, promising him not only life but also three pence a day so long as he lived, to be paid out of the king's coffer; but he, having recovered his spirits, again refused the prince's offer, choosing eftsoons to taste the fire, and so to die, than to forsake his opinions. Where upon the prince commanded that he should be put into the tun again, from thenceforth not to have any favour or pardon at all ; and so it was done, and the fire put to him again, and he consumed to ashes.\"* The case of William Thorpe, a priest distinguished for his learning and ability, who was brought before Archbishop Arun del on a charge of heresy on the 3d of July, 1407, is peculiarly interesting, on account of the light which it casts on the opinions both of the Lollards and their persecutors. We have a full and minute account of the proceedings drawn up by Thorpe himself, f He was closely interrogated in private by the archbishop himself in the presence of only three witnesses, respecting the sacra ment, the worship of images, pilgrimages, confession, and the right of the clergy to tithes. On all these points the opinions of Thorpe were explicitly condemned, as con trary to the doctrines taught by the church. The undaunted priest avowed himself a disciple of\" Master John Wycliffe,\" who, he observes, \"was holden of full many men the This cruel persecution of the followers of Wycliffe was one of the deepest stains upon the character of Henry IV., all the more so that it proceeded, not from conviction, but from policy.

The continual anxiety which had harassed him throughout his career, and his overexertion of both mind and body, had impaired his constitution while he was still in his prime. The wild and dissolute con duct of his eldest son, too, must have caused him great uneasiness ; and he is said to have been continually haunted by remorse for the crimes which had elevated him to that dignity whose insecurity and hollowness he had fully proved. He grew prematurely old, became gloomy, solitary, and suspicious, and tried to pacify his conscience by making a vow to visit the Holy Land. He is said to have been subject to occasional sits of epilepsy; during one of these, it is probable, the circumstance occurred which has been handed down, as characteristic at once of the aspiring views of a young prince, and the melancholy retrospect of a dying king whose conscience was not at peace. One day when he lay stretched on his bed apparently dead, the crown was removed from the cushion on which it was usually placed, and was con veyed into another room. Upon returning to his senses, the king asked who had borne it away, and upon learning that it was done by the prince, he summoned him into his presence. After a gentle remonstrance, he is reported to have said: \"Alas! fair son, what right have you to the crown, when you know your father had none?\" \"My liege,\" replied the other, \" with the sword you won it, and with the sword I will keep it.\" After a pause the king faintly rejoined : \"Well, do as you think best; I leave the issue to God, and hope he wdl have mercy on my soul.\"* the forty-seventh year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign. His body was interred in Canterbury Cathedral by the side of Lady Mary de Bohun, his first wife. The character of Henry IV., though not altogether destitute of shining qualities, does not rank high among English mon archs, and has descended to modern times with few associations which excite attach ment. He was, however, possessed of great prudence, firmness, vigilance, and foresight, remarkable command of his temper, and dis tinguished courage; but he was ambitious, selfish, unrelenting, and unscrupulous. In the field he exhibited considerable talents, at least if we may be allowed to estimate them by the success which attended his war like operations ; though it is not improbable that much of his fame in this respect may have been owing to the slender abilities of those to whom he was opposed. Except at Shrewsbury, he never encountered any formidable antagonist in the open plain; his campaigns against Glendwr being confined to skirmishes on the sides of mountains and the brinks of lakes, where the skill of tbe general was superseded by the dexterity of the private soldier. The wisdom and vigour, however, with which he swayed the sceptre, atoned in some measure for the unjustifiable means by which he obtained it; and Henry may, perhaps, be classed among those usurp ers who, in the pursuit of personal greatness, have conferred important benefits upon the people whom they undertook to rule. By bis first marriage with Mary de Bohun, daughter of the earl of Hereford, the late king had six children \u2014 the Prince of Wales, who bore the same name, and who had already given proofs of the courage and martial genius which afterwards rendered him so celebrated as a warrior ; Thomas, duke of Clarence ; John, duke of Bedford ; and Humphrey, duke of Gloucester; together with Blanche, who was united to the duke of Bavaria, and Philippa, who became queen of Denmark.

ALBANS DEPOSITION OF HENRY. Henry V. surnamed of Monmouth, where he was born in 1388, succeeded peacefully to the throne on his father's death. His courage and military talents began to exhibit themselves at an early age. He was only sixteen when he \"fleshed his maiden sword\" at the battle of Shrewsbury, where, in spite of a severe wound in the face, he continued to fight with unflinching bravery till the victory was gained. His next exploit was against the Welsh chieftain, Owen Glendwr, whom, as we have seen, he repeatedly de feated in the field and reduced to great ex tremity. Yet Henry's youth is commonly represented as having been devoted to pleasure, and even disgraced by some degree of irregularity. Though there is much reason to doubt the extent to which these licenses were carried, the voice of history, assisted by the captivating delineations of the dramatic muse, continues to assert that riot and debauchery filled up the vacancies of a mind better adapted to the pursuits of ambition and the cares of government. It has been remarked in his defence, that, as he was engaged during three years in quell ing the insurrection of Glendwr, and that in the latter period of his father's reign he presided in the counsel, it is not probable he could have led a very dissipated life.* There is, however, no doubt that, when he ascended the throne, he manifested the virtues and magnanimity of a great sove reign. The first beams of his kindness were directed to Mortimer, earl of March, whose better claim to the crown had alie nated from him the affections of the former monarch. Henry also restored to its for tune and honours the family of Percy, which had suffered so deeply for its attach ment to Richard II., and for the ill-judged attempts which it had made to overthrow the Lancastrian dynasty. It likewise be came an object with him to vindicate the character of the unfortunate king just named, and to extend favour to all who had continued loyal towards him ; and the path to rank and emolument was opened alike to all. We have already alluded to the theological dissensions which disturbed for a time the government of Henry IV. The doctrines of Wycliffe, not always well considered or matured even when taught by himself, had been exaggerated by party zeal and distorted by opposition, and were now fast assuming such a form as would have rendered their application quite incompatible with the existence of regular authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical. Their levelling tenets bad excited the anger or alarm of the king during the lifetime of his father, and he had joined with those who petitioned the * Hallam, vol. ii. p. 303."], [385, "A.D. 1413.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 347 sovereign for the arrest and punishment of the more inflammatory among the preachers. Whether it was their knowledge of this aversion from their principles, or whether they were roused to activity by some other cause, is doubtful ; but soon after the prince had ascended the throne they affixed placards to the doors of the different churches in London, giving an assurance that if he opposed their doctrines by force, they would meet him at the head of a hundred thousand armed men.* When brought before the primate for trial, Cobham used great freedom of speech ; alone and unsupported, he pleaded two whole days in defence of his opinions in the synod of prelates and abbots. Following in the path of Wycliffe, he maintained that the church had ceased to be orthodox from the moment at which she became wealthy ; that the clergy, viewed as a body, were the true Antichrist ; that the pope was the head, the bishops and other prelates the limbs, and the religious orders the tail of tbe Beast. He denounced, at the same time, the persons appointed to form a judgment of his opinions as false teachers, and as only qualified to lead their hearers to the miseries of the bottomless pit. As he resolutely refused to retract, he was condemned as an obstinate heretic, and sentenced to the flames (10th October, 1413); but the archbishop, desirous that an opportunity should be afforded to Sir John for reconsidering his conclusions, obtained from the king a respite of forty days.* It was found that they were encouraged in this daring defiance of the government by Sir John Oldcastle, commonly called in right of his wife Lord Cobham. Sir John, who was \" a strong man, and a metely good man of war,\" had long patronized the views of the Lollards, and enabled them to treat with contempt the menaces of the spiritual courts. As that knight had enjoyed the friendship of the king, the convocation was, perhaps, unwilling to have recourse to severe measures against him, more especially as Henry still entertained the hope that he would be able to prevail upon his former associate to relinquish his new opinions, and to submit his judgment in matters of theology to the direction of the ecclesiastical councils. The arguments of the king, however, failed to convince the stubborn knight ; and hence his expected triumph over the heresy of Sir John was converted into a painful and mortifying disappointment. The king then grew angry, a common infirmity of controversialists, and began to threaten his former friend with the extreme penalties of the law against heretics; upon which Sir John withdrew from Windsor to his manor of Cowling, in Kent. Finding that the knight derided excommunciation, and answered with scorn all the citations of the archbishop, the royal monitor found it necessary to employ a mili tary force for his apprehension, and to lodge him in the Tower \u25a0( Oldcastle, however, contrived to escape from the Tower, and proceeded to collect his adherents and to make preparations for attacking the metropolis, seizing the person of Henry, and introducing a new system of temporal rule. Thousands flocked to his standard, under the general impression that some salutary changes were about to be introduced, and without, perhaps, medi tating any seditious inroad upon the royal authority. The intentions of their leader, however, were soon made manifest, for he attempted to take prisoners the sovereign and his retinue, while solemnizing a birth day at Eltham \u2014 an enterprise which failed of success only by the sudden departure of the court for Westminster. Disappointed in this stratagem, he did not, however, relin quish the hope of reducing the king to the condition of a captive ; but summon in\" his followers to meet in the fields near St. Giles', he entertained the resolution of attacking the city by surprise, and of making * Walsingham, p. 426. t Walsingham, p. 427.

On this occasion Henry, who had received notice of the plan contemplated by the insurgents, had recourse to the most prudent means for defeating it. Shutting the gates, he pre vented all intercourse between the Lollards within and those without ; and proceeding at midnight with a strong body of troops to the spot at which Cobham's rural con tingents were instructed to assemble, he found only some fourscore men instead of the twenty-five thousand insurgents, who, according to rumour, were to meet in the meadows of St. Giles', under the command of Sir John. The handful who had assem bled, however, had arms in their hands, and were therefore taken into custody. Detachments of troops were then sent along the several roads leading to the alleged place of rendezvous, but the only assemblage of any consequence was at Harengay Park, where a considerable number of Lollards were taken prisoners.* strong reason to believe that their characters have been unjustly maligned, and their de- signs misstated and exaggerated, by the fears and the malice of their enemies. They were treated with merciless severity by the king and the Parliament. On the 13th of January, 1413, thirty of them were executed in St. Giles' Fields, being drawn and hanged as traitors, and then burned as heretics. Sir Roger Acton, a friend of Oldcastle, was taken, drawn, and hanged on the 10th of February. But Sir John himself made his escape ; and though immense rewards were offered for his apprehension, no man could be found to betray him, so greatly was he beloved. About four years after, however, he emerged from his place of concealment in Wales, and showed himself in the neigh- bourhood of London. In attempting to regain his former hiding-place he was captured after a gallant resistance, on the borders of Wales, and executed in St. Giles' Fields as a traitor and a heretic. He died with great courage, and was revered by the Lollards as a saint and a martyr to the cause of truth.* When brought to trial, it appeared that, whatever the number of the insurgents might amount to, few were in the secret of the conspiracy, the great mass having been content to follow their leaders with the most implicit confidence. It is impossible at this distant period, and in the absence of all exculpatory evidence, to ascertain the pre cise objects which had heated the imagina tion of Oldcastle and had drawn him into a scheme not less dangerous than impracticable. The Commons in their address assert that the Lollards had sought to destroy \" the Christian faith, the king, the spiritual and temporal estates, and all manner of policy and law ;\" and Henry, in a proclamation which he thought it expedient to issue, declares that they meant to assassinate him, his brothers, and several peers, to confiscate the possessions of the church, to secularize the religious orders, to divide the realm into confederated districts, and to nominate Sir John president of the commonwealth. Unfortunately the Lollards have had no historian to tell their story ; but there is The stigma of heresy attached to the memory of this gallant old soldier and reformer contributed not a little to diminish the influence of the party of which he had been the head ; for though the people were eager to obtain the reform of what they esteemed abuses, they were not yet prepared to impugn the doctrines of the church, nor to pronounce her decisions fallacious. Even the Parliament, which already viewed with an unfriendly eye the ecclesiastical patrimony, was firmly opposed to all innovation in point of principle. It enacted, not only that judges and magis trates should arrest all persons suspected of Lollardism, but also that whosoever was convicted, besides suffering capital punish ment, should forfeit his lands and goods to the king. It was likewise provided that the chancellor, treasurer, sheriffs, justices of the peace, and all the chief magistrates in every city and borough, should take an * Walsingham, p 429. * Ibid. p. 431."], [387, "a.d. 1413-1415.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 349 oath to use their utmost endeavours to effect the extirpation of heresy.* selves as a prey to the cupidity of statesmen, who are tempted to relieve the burden of public taxation at the expense of bodies whose usefulness has generally failed to keep pace with the increase of their wealth. These severe laws were meant to protect evangelical truth, without any regard to the interests of the clergy as the owners of certain rents and lands. A distinction, indeed, was already made between the church and churchmen ; and thus while every encroachment on the revenue of the latter was deemed just and even patriotic, a degree of tenderness was felt for the national creed, not easy to be reconciled with the indifference manifested for the professional persons by whom it was taught and defended. The same Parliament which awarded the most cruel penalties against the disciples of Wycliffe, recommended to the king to supply his wants from the riches of ecclesi astics, following in this respect the example of their predecessors in the former reign ; and Henry, who had no small difficulty in raising the ways and means for prosecuting the war in France, did not conceal from the priesthood that he looked to them for a liberal contribution. Finding themselves pressed at once by the sovereign and the legislature, the prelates suggested the ap propriation to secular uses of the income belonging to those priories which had been attached to the larger abbeys in Normandy, when that province acknowledged subjection to the English crown. f The quiet which prevailed at home, dis turbed only by slight dissensions in theo logical opinions, enabled the new sovereign to turn his attention to the affairs of France. The imbecility of Charles VI. had occa sioned in that country tbe most miserable distractions, which were not a little increased by the ambition of certain nobles, who, either from proximity of blood or the extent of their possessions, thought themselves entitled to assume the direction of public measures. The competition for power be tween the adherents of Orleans and Bur gundy was decided by treachery and murder; both sides entered into secret negotiations with Henry, who determined not to lose so good an opportunity of re-demanding for the English the advantages secured to them by the treaty of Bretigny ; and accordingly, in April, 1415, he announced to his great council at Westminster his firm resolution of making a \" voyage in his own proper per son, by the grace of God, to recover his inheritance.\" But perhaps the motives which carried Henry V. into the field were less connected with the love of foreign dominion than with the desire of domestic tranquillity. His father, on his death-bed, enjoined him not to allow his people to remain too long at peace, which, he remarked, was ever apt to breed commotions in England. On the contrary, he recommended that they should be employed in frequent expeditions beyond sea, in which the prince might acquire honour, and the nobility, by sharing his dangers, might attach themselves to his per son, and, above all, the restless spirits, by finding suitable occupation, might be less disposed to disturb his government.* Such counsel accorded too well with the natural bent of the young king's temper to incur any hazard of neglect. Before, how- These facts show clearly that the argu ments employed by the successors of Wyc liffe, although derided by courts of justice and the doctors of universities, had made a considerable impression on the minds ofthe people, and even on those who represented their interests in the House of Commons. No mode of reform has ever been more popular than that which assails the privi leges of corporations, whether clerical or civil, and which promises to derive from their funds an equivalent for general taxa tion ; and hence, in proportion as such bodies augment their riches, they excite the envy of the people and expose them- * Rot.

The French were willing to cement peace by bestowing the hand of their Princess Catherine on the king of England, with a por tion of eight hundred thousand crowns, and the restitution of Aquitaine as it had been possessed by the Black Prince. But Henry V. demanded far more ample concessions. He refused to listen to any conditions short of those which had been comprised in the treaty of Bretigny, together with the dis charge of the arrears of sixteen hundred thousand crowns, still due for the ransom of King John, and the hand of the king's daughter, with a marriage portion of two millions of crowns. Henry was in the vigour of manhood, newly possessed of power, brave, enterprising, and ambitious. The recent unquiet state of England made it politic to find employment for spirits which might else renew civd trouble ; and the still con tinued distractions of France gave reasonable hope of conquest. While his ambassadors, therefore, were entertained with shows and tournaments* in Paris, he was actively preparing at home the materials of real warfare. proposed for the accomplishment of this end involved the assent and co-operation of others who probably had not been informed of their intentions, especially the Percys of Northumberland and some Scottish barons, who were expected to join in proclaiming the earl of March as king of England, in case Richard II. were really dead. Cam bridge, Scrope, and Grey were condemned and punished as traitors, with much less regard to the forms of justice than was due to so important an occasion.* After suppressing this conspiracy, Henry V. left the shores of England, and entered the mouth of the Seine with a fleet of sixteen hundred vessels conveying twenty four thousand archers and six thousand men-at-arms. Having landed his troops and stores without resistance or interrup tion, he issued a proclamation forbidding, under the penalty of death, the plunder or ill treatment of the people. And it is admitted by the French contemporary historians that Henry enforced the uniform good treatment of the inhabitants of the districts through which he passed, even when his troops were suffering the most dreadful privations. Harfleur, which he first invested, an important mercantile town on the right bank of the river, defended itself vigorously for about five weeks. But the dauphin, who had promised relief to the garrison, was unable to fulfil his engage ment ; and after their gates had been demolished and their walls undermined, the citizens were compelled to surrender. The English, however, had suffered greatly during the short siege ; they were straitened for pro visions ; more than two thousand men had fallen victims to a dysentery produced by too copious indulgence in the tempting fruits to which they were unaccustomed, and which the season furnished in abund ance ; and the usual casualties of war had contributed to diminish their numbers. But a return to England after the single It was while the king was employed in collecting an armament for his meditated descent into France, that tidings reached his ears of the only conspiracy which disturbed his reign. As it was immediately quashed, without having extended beyond the original promoters, it is now very difficult to assign the motives or to discover the object. It is usually traced to the earl of Cambridge, second son of the late duke of York, who, having married Anne, sister to the young Mortimer, necessarily felt his interest in the family of March much augmented. Accord ingly, the earl consulted Lord Scrope (a noble who enjoyed the complete confidence of the king) and Sir Thomas Grey about the propriety of recovering the crown for the legitimate heir ofthe monarchy.

This preliminary operation was dangerous, for he had to march seventy leagues through a hostile country, and watched by a superior army. himself from a position of extreme peril. The constable, having thus been foiled in his attempt to maintain this line of defence fell back from the Somme, and marched along the Calais road as far as St. Pol. Henry followed by the same road on which the con stable fell back, to the villages of Ruisseau ville and Agincourt. On the night of the 24th the head-quarters of the English were fixed in the little village of Maisoncelles, about three bowshots from the plain of Agincourt, before which the constable had pitched his camp. The duke of Aquitaine had been peremptorily forbidden by the king from taking the field, and a similar prohibition had been sent by the duke of Burgundy to his only son, the count de Charolois. Nevertheless, we are assured that the French were fully one hundred and fifty thousand strong* \u2014 a prodigious exaggeration, even if we include the vast train of useless followers who, during those times, hung upon the movements and encumbered the operations of an army. Their fighting men may perhaps be calcu lated to have a little exceeded a third of the number above stated, and to have been more than three times as many as the English, half of whose original force had perished before Harfleur, and in the subsequent march. Having tarried about fifteen days in Harfleur, where he offered a solemn thanks giving for his success, walking bare-legged and bare-footed to the parochial church of St. Martin,* Henry, on the 6th of October, commenced his bold and hazardous move ment at the head of an army, which was now reduced to nine thousand men.f A powerful army under the king and the dauphin lay at Rouen ; another, commanded by the constable of France, was posted in front of the invaders in Picardy, and addi tional troops were pouring in from every side. In their march through Normandy the English met with little resistance, but numerous detachments ofthe enemy watched his movements and cut off stragglers, and his soldiers suffered severely from fatigue and the want of proper food. On the 12th of October they reached the memorable ford of Blanche-tache, at which Edward III. had crossed the Somme, and extricated his army from a nearly similar difficulty, but it was too strongly guarded to be forced. Toul de Remy also was occupied by the enemy ; so also was Ponteau de Mer, and various other fords up the river, which Henry tried in succession; but between Betencourt and Vayenne, near St. Quentin, at length effected a passage of the river (October 19) at a spot which had been neglected, and thus extricated After a smart skirmish with a reinforce ment, which, in joining the constable, had fallen in with the English outposts, the night was passed by each host in preparation for the approaching combat. A cold and heavy rain dispirited the soldiers on both sides, and it was remarked as an evil omen in the French camp, that scarcely any of their horses neighed during the many hours of darkness. f The English, fatigued by long marches, scantily provisioned, and badly quartered, awaited the morrow in silence, fully resolved to sell their lives dearly, but looking forward to almost certain death. Most of them were employed in acts ofdevotion, in confessing, or in receiving the Eucharist. * Monstrelet, vol. iv. c. 29. t Sir H. Nicolas says that not more than nine thousand fighting men could have left Haifleur, but there is a strong probability that tbe force did not much exceed six thousand. * Monstrelet, vol. iv. c. 30. f Monstrelet, vol. iv. c. 30.

The causes of the victory of the English at Agincourt are not so palpable as those which occasioned the similar terminations at Crecy and at Poictiers, although they are generally resolved into the presumption of the French; but the French, in truth, appear to have been much less confident in their superiority of numbers on the last occasion, than on either of those which preceded, and it is probable, in consequence, that they exercised greater precaution. The chief defect in their generalship appears to have been in the choice of ground, which lay for the most part among fresh-sown, ploughed fields in a clayey soil, inclosed by copses, and which, therefore, presented two consider able obstacles to the free man\u0153uvring of the numerous heavy-armed cavalry which formed their principal strength. Their army, as usual, was distributed into three grand divisions. The constable himself commanded the van, gallantly supported by the dukes of Orleans and of Bourbon, the Marechal Boucicaut, and many others of the chief nobility. He was followed by about eight thousand men-at-arms, four thousand archers, and fifteen hundred cross-bowmen ; on his right were eight hundred men at-arms ; on his left, nearly twice that number destined to attack the English flanks. The main battalion, equally strong with the van, was placed under the orders of the dukes of Bar and of Alencon ; and both these were supported by a powerful reserve. \" When they were all drawn up, it was a grand sight to view, and they were, on a hasty survey, estimated to be more than six times the number of English. Some, however, the wisest of them, had their fears, and dreaded the event of an open battle.\"* inactivity, dislodged from Maisoncelles. Sir Thomas Erpingham, a knight grown gray with age and honour, marshalled the line, arraying the archers in front, the men-at arms behind, two wings similarly consti tuted, and the horses, with the baggage, in the rear. The archers in addition to their usual weapons carried each a long stake sharpened at both ends, the upper end being tipped with iron, which they were directed to fix obliquely in the ground before them, so as to afford a protection against the enemy's cavalry. These dispositions having been made, Henry, mounted on a small gray horse, rode along the lines of each division, wearing a helmet of polished steel, sur mounted with a crown of gold set with sparkling gems. As he rode from rank to rank he addressed a few words to his men, reminding them of the glorious victories gained by their ancestors against equally superior numbers. He assured them that England should never have to pay a ransom for him, for he had determined to conquer or die on the field. He called to their recollection the horrible cruelties perpetrated on their countrymen who had been taken prisoners at Soissons \u2014 an allusion which had a wonderful effect \u2014 and informed them that the French had sworn to cut off three fingers of the right hands of the archers to unfit them for handling the bow. \" We have not come,\" he said, \" into our king dom of France like mortal enemies ; we have not burnt towns and villages ; we have not outraged women and maidens, like our adversaries at Soissons. They are full of sin, and have no fear of God.\" As Henry passed one of the divisions he heard a gallant officer, named Walter Hungerford, expressing a wish that some of the brave knights and archers living at home were with them in the field. \" No,\" exclaimed the king, \"I would not have a single man more. If God gives us the victory, the fewer we are the more honour ; and if we lose, the less will be the loss to our country. But we will not lose ; fight as you were wont to do, and before night Either this diffidence, or a want of com bination among the leaders, prevented the French, notwithstanding their overwhelming numerical advantage, from commencing the attack. It was ten in the morning, and they still sat under their banners taking refresh ment, when the English, surprised at their * Monstrelet, vol. iv. c. 31."], [391, "A.D. 1415.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 353 the pride of our numberless enemies shall be humbled to the dust.\"* archers,* disordered the French van ; and although they stooped to avoid being hit upon their vizors, numbers were killed or severely wounded by the English bowmen. Those troops were accoutred for light service, being for the most part without defensive armour, dressed only in jackets, with their hair loose, and hatchets or swords hanging to their girdles ; some, indeed, were entirely bare-headed, and their chief reliance against a charge of cavalry was placed in the stockade of sharpened stakes, planted before them in the ground. As they closed, the French, distressed by their previous volley, gave way. Many of them had already fallen, and the wing of eight hun dred men-at-arms was reduced to seven score before it could come into action. The wounded horses, rendered unmanageable by pain, increased the confusion, and that portion of the van which was not trampled down became panic-stricken and fled. The archers pressed the advantage which they had gained, and throwing down their bows, fought lustily with swords, hatchets, mallets, and bill-hooks, slaying all before them. Antoine, duke of Brabant (brother of the duke of Burgundy), who had but recently arrived in the camp, attempted a gallant charge between the wreck of the van and the second division; but he was instantly overthrown and killed, with the whole of his company. Meanwhile there wras an entire want of combination and unity of action among the French leaders. \" The constable,\" says Barante, \" was, by right of his office, the commander-in-chief of the French army; but there were with him so many princes who had all wills of their own, that it was not easy for him to obtain obedience. The duke of Orleans, the count of Nevers, and other brave but rash nobles, were eacer to attack the English at once, but the constable insisted that they should wait the arrival of fresh reinforcements under the duke of Brittany and the Marshal de Soigny; and he even sent two envoys to the English camp to offer Henry a free passage if he would restore Harfleur, together with the prisoners he had made, and resign his pretensions to the crown of France. The English king, however, undismayed by the formidable array of the enemies who barred his way, would only negotiate on the same terms as he had offered in his own capital. Seeing that the French would not begin the action, Henry resolved to attack them. He despatched two hundred archers with orders to make a secret circuit, by which, without being perceived, they might post themselves on the left flank of the French, to act as opportunity offered. Another detachment was sent to lie in ambush in their rear, where, when the battle began, they were to create an alarm by setting fire to a barn and a house at Hesdin. It was about the hour of noon when the king gave the order \u2014 \" Bowmen, advance !\" On this Sir Thomas Erpingham, the commander of the archers, threw up his truncheon, crying out, \" Nestrocque,\" and dismounted as the king and others had done. At that signal the English line, to the very great astonishment of the French, set up a loud shout and advanced with repeated huzzas, occasionally stopping to recover breath. Meantime a cloud of arrows, shot to the utmost possible height by the The main battalion of the French, how ever, closed up and renewed the contest, though the weight of their armour made them sink knee-deep in the newly-ploughed field. Henry now brought up his men-at arms, and restored the ranks of the bowmen, which had been disordered by their charge on the broken array of the French knights. The struggle for a time was exceedingly fierce, and the king himself was in immediate danger. His brother, the duke of Clarence, * Monstrelet says by at least thirteen thousand archers. A MS., of which Mr. Turner has made great use in his account of Henry's expedition (Sloane, MSS. 1770), reduces the number of archers with whom Henry broke up from Harfleur to five thousand. \u2014 History of England during the Middle Ages, v. ii. p. 399. * Monstrelet. 45"], [392, "354 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1415. was wounded and thrown down, and would have been killed but for the prompt inter position of the king himself. He was next assailed by a band of eighteen knights, waving the banner of the lord of Crecy, one of whom struck the king so violent a blow with his battle-axe that Henry staggered and fell on his knees. But his men instantly closed around him, and slew the whole of his assailants. enemies, although scattered over the field, might have rallied at any turn of fortune ; and had the battle been renewed, its tide might have changed. Under the belief that fresh reinforcements had arrived, and that he was about to be surrounded, ignorant of the precise nature and force of the assailants, and without other means of counteracting the great peril by which he was menaced, Henry adopted a course for the justification of which we must lay aside all remembrance of the more civilized usages which have mitigated the ferocity of war in these later times, and must transfer ourselves altogether to the semi-barbarous age to which the occurrence belongs. The prisoners, who nearly equalled their captors in number, would inevitably have profited by any confusion which promised deliver ance; and to preserve himself from being thus overpowered, the king issued an order that they should be put to the sword. As soon, however, as he discovered his mistake, and that no real danger was to be appre hended from this source, Henry gave orders to stop the carnage, and to look after the wounded. The duke of Alencon, who had broken valiantly through the English line, had fought his way to the post which Henry then occupied. As the French prince approached his royal antagonist, he struck down and wounded the duke of York ; and when the king rushed forward to raise and assist his uncle, Alencon dealt a furious blow upon the royal helmet, and sheared away part of the crown by which it was ornamented. The press of enemies, however, by whom he was surrounded deprived him of all hope unless from surrender; and while he was declaring his name and rank, and present ing his gauntlet in token of submission to Henry, who had stretched out his hand to receive it, he fell pierced with innumerable wounds from the bystanders. The fall of the duke ended the battle, for his followers immediately took to flight; and the third division, a reserve of the French army which had never drawn sword, terrified by the defeat of the other divisions, abandoned the field and fled.* About six hundred men-at-arms who remained unbroken in the French line attempted a final charge, but all of them were killed or taken prisoners. While the enemy was flying before him in all direc tions, like dust before the wind, Henry, who was making the circuit of the plain. asked the herald, Mountjoye, the French king-at-arms, to whom he adjudged the victory ? Mountjoye answered, Doubtless, to the English. \" It is not we\" replied the king, \" who have made this great slaughter, but the Omnipotent God; and, as we believe, for a punishment of the sins of the French.\" He then inquired the name of a castle which he saw near at hand, and on being informed that it was called Agincourt, \" Well then,\" he added, \" since all battles should bear the name of the fortress nearest to the spot upon which they are fought, this battle shall henceforth bear the ever-durable name of Agincourt.\" Meantime, during the very heat of combat, when the battle, although manifestly in clining in favour of the English, might still eventually have proved adverse, it was announced to the king that his rear had been attacked and plundered. A valuable booty, indeed, had been carried off from the baggage by some men-at-arms and peasants who found it undefended; and we are told of a precious sword set with diamonds which formed part of Henry's loss, and which was afterwards presented by one of the marauders to the count of Charolois. The moment was in finitely dangerous to the English, for their * Monstrelet, v. iv. c. 32."], [393, "a.d. 1415-1416.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 355 The English remained upon the field till nightfall, satisfied with their great and un expected success, and discreetly forbearing pursuit. They then retired to their former quarters at Maisoncelles ; and when they had quitted their station, \"several of the French, half-dead and wounded, crawled away into an adjoining wood or some villages, as well as they could, where many expired.\" Those who were unable to escape were put to death or made prisoners on the following morning, when the conquerors returned to the field in their onward march. Upwards of ten thousand French had fallen in the battle, and of these, the chronicler assures us, it is supposed that all but sixteen hundred were gentlemen. Amongst the slain were the Constable D'Albret, tbe duke of Bar and two of his brothers, and the duke of Alencon, the duke of Brabant and the count of Nevers, brothers to the duke of Burgundy (all of them near relatives to the king), and one hundred and twenty bannerets.* No reckoning was made of the many dead bodies removed by friends for honourable interment elsewhere, nor of the wounded \" who died in hospitals, towns, villages, and even in the adjacent woods, whose number must have been very great.\" But the count of Charolois, who was sorely distressed by the loss of his uncles, ordered a hucre square, measuring seventy-five feet in each front, to be traced out on the field of battle. Within this space three trenches twelve feet in width were excavated, for the reception of five thousand eight hundred bodies, \"by an account kept,\" and this Aceldama was afterwards inclosed and con secrated. the earl of Suffolk. Passing over the scene of his victory on the morning which followed it, Henry proceeded on his march to Calais, whence, after having refreshed his exhausted army, he sailed triumphantly to Dover. He judged rightly that he had achieved enough on the plain of Agincourt to satisfy his glory. At this period the Emperor Sigismund arrived in England. He had undertaken this toilsome journey with the benevolent view of extinguishing the schism which had so long troubled and disgraced the Papal See. During the contest between the rival popes, the court of France and the house of Lancaster took opposite sides \u2014 a position not likely to be changed by the success of the latter in the battle of Agin court. The king of the Romans, desirous to promote unanimity of views on a question so essential to the welfare of the church, resolved to visit both kingdoms in person, and to reconcile the two monarchs in their feelings of allegiance as sons of the same holy mother. His success at Paris enabled him to cross the Channel ; and Henry en deavoured by the most magnificent prepa rations for his reception to convince his guest that he had the command of very extensive resources. He issued a royal proclamation, requiring all knights and esquires to attend their sovereign in the capital ; and he assembled at Calais a fleet of three hundred ships to convey the emperor and his retinue, amounting to a thousand horsemen, to the English shore, whence he was escorted with equal parade to London.* Tbe missionary labours of Sigismund were not without effect. He prevailed upon the pope, John NXIII., to call the Council of Constance, by which the contending pontiffs were either deposed or induced to resign, and the Cardinal Colonna was unani mously chosen to fill the chair thereby rendered vacant. To give greater weight to this election, six persons from each of tbe nations of Italy, Germany, England, France, About fifteen hundred prisoners were conveyed to the English quarters, and some of the most illustrious leaders, the dukes of Orleans and of Bourbon, and the Marechal Boucicaut, were comprised in that number. The loss of the conquerors was estimated at sixteen hundred men, and we do not hear of any names of distinction among them, excepting those of the duke of York and * Rymer vol. ix. p. 339. * Monstrelet, vol. iv. c. 32."], [394, "356 HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The dauphin, who was the son-in-law of the duke of Burgundy, died after a few days' illness, and a report was immediately spread that he had been poisoned by the Armagnacs. The latter held posses sion of the capital, which they ruled with great severity, while the duke and his par tizans ravaged the country up to the very gates of the city. According to a French chronicler one might have ridden a whole day in the country, near Paris, without seeing a farm-house which had not been burnt or pillaged either by the Bourguignons, or by the troops of Lombards, Germans, Savoyards, and other mercenaries, who had been hired by one or other of the factions, and finding themselves paid by neither, preyed upon the miserable peasantry and farmers. At the beginning of 1417 the new dauphin, John, suddenly fell sick and died, and the duke of Burgundy openly charged his enemies with the murder, by poison, of the luckless prince. The extravagance, dissipation, and licentiousness of the queen had long been notorious ; but she somehow at this time gave offence to the powerful count of Armagnac, who instigated her idiotic husband to give orders for the arrest of her paramour, the Sire de Bois-Bourden. He was put to the torture, and at last thrown into the Seine, sewed up in a leather bag which bore this inscription, \" Let pass the justice of the king.\" Isabella herself was seized a few days after and con veyed a prisoner to Tours, and her treasure was appropriated by the count of Armagnac and her son the Dauphin Charles. She had previously been the implacable enemy of the duke of Burgundy, but now her recent wrongs effaced her enmity on account of old injuries, and she found means to open a correspondence with the duke, in order to be avenged on the count and the dauphin. The position of the Armagnac leader became exceedingly critical, and his adversaries increased daily, both in numbers and in During the visit of Sigismund to Eng land the French, who had begun to recover from the effects of their sanguinary defeat at Agincourt, commenced the siege of Harfleur \u2014 Henry's recent conquest \u2014 both by land and water. The garrison were few in number and suffering from sickness, but reinforcements were sent from England under the duke of Bedford, the king's brother. On the 14th of August the duke approached the mouth of the Seine, where he found the French fleet lying, reinforced by some great carracks from Genoa, and several galleys and other large high-decked vessels from Spain. Next morning the allied fleet imprudently quitted their advan tageous position, and sailed out to attack the English. The battle was long, fierce, and bloody. In the end the English gained a complete victory. Most of their enemy's vessels were either taken or sunk, and the land forces immediately raised the siege and fled. A few weeks after this signal success King Henry, accompanied by his guests Sigismund and William of Bavaria, crossed to Calais, and held a kind of secret con gress, which was attended by the duke of Burgundy, John Sans-peur, as he was termed, who from this time forward began to incline towards the English. Henry then returned to England to make prepara tions for a new invasion of France on an extensive scale, which, it was confidently expected, would result in the permanent conquest of the country. His preparations were not completed until the following autumn (1417), when he once more landed in France. Meanwhile that unhappy country was torn by the fiercest intestine feuds. The Burgundians, or Bourguignons, and the * On this occasion the English nation was represented by the bishops of London, Bath, Lichfield, and Norwich, the dean of York, and the abbot of St. Mary's in the same city.

He had with him the finest and best-equipped army that England had ever sent against her old enemy. It consisted of sixteen thousand men-at-arms, about an equal number of archers, along with a body of sappers and miners and artificers of all kinds, and was provided with a train of artillery and military engines. Tonque, Auvillers, Vil lers, and Caen were taken after a short resistance. Bayeux surrendered without a blow, and L'Aigle. Lisieux, Falaise, and other towns and castles, speedily submitted to his arms. On the approach of winter Henry repaired to winter quarters, having prudently resolved not to march into the interior of the country until he bad reduced the fortresses in Normandy. The French court, distracted and humbled, sent to implore peace ; but Henry would accede to their request only on condition that he should receive the hand of the Princess Catherine, the king's daughter, and should be immediately declared regent of the king dom, and successor to the throne upon tbe death of Charles. the conqueror, and to his appeals to the traditions of their ancient glory under their common ancestors; but Henry, to his credit, inflicted no vengeance on them for the obstinate resistance which they offered to his arms. On the contrary, he did what in him lay to conciliate them by just and popular measures, and by the abolition of illegal exactions, and of the odious tax upon salt, which their own government had imposed. Meanwhile the civd war continued to rage fiercely in other parts ofthe country. Queen Isabella regained her liberty by the assist ance of the duke of Burgundy, whom she appointed governor general of the kingdom ; and most of the towns, except those which were in possession of the English, declared for her and the duke. In many places the people rose against the tax-gatherers ap pointed by the Armagnacs, and put them to death. On the other hand, the count, with his captains Barbazan and Tannegui du Chatel, issued from Paris, and took several castles and towns from the Bur gundians, giving little or no quarter to the garrisons. The other party retaliated by killing their prisoners, and nothing was seen on all sides but rapine and murder. At length an effort was made by some persons about the king and dauphin to put an end to this frightful state of anarchy and bloodshed. A proposal was made for a general reconciliation, and envoys ap pointed by the two factions met at a village called La Tombe, near Montereau, and discussed the terms of peace. The cardinals Ursini and St. Mark, who had been de spatched by the new pope, Martin V., to act as mediators, arrived at this juncture, and strove earnestly to bring about a reconcilia tion. A treaty was agreed to by the nego tiators, which met with the approbation of the chief citizens of Paris, but was rejected by the count, on the ground that its effect would have been to place the whole power of the government in the hands of the duke of Burgundy and of the queen. D'Annag nac, in consequence, returned to the capital In the following spring (1418) the Eng lish army was reinforced by a detachment of several thousand men, including a con siderable number of Irish, and was thus enabled to carry on several sieges at the same time. Cherbourg on the coast, and Damfront in the interior, fell into their bands; and advancing to the left bank of the Seine, Henry made himself master of the whole lower part of that river from Louviers to the sea. The town of Louviers was then besieged and taken. Pont de l'Arche next opened its gates, and by the month of July the invaders were masters of the whole of Lower Normandy. The people, and especially the citizens of the towns, though abandoned by the court and even by their own barons, made a brave but unavailing struggle to maintain the independence of their country. They re fused to listen to the liberal promises of"], [396, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1418. 358 by their commander, surrendered on the promise of personal safety. with a great increase of unpopularity.* His proscriptions and his grievous imposts had greatly exasperated the people, and nothing prevented the outbreak of an insurrection but the terror of three thousand Gascons, who were quartered in the city. The exiled butchers, on the downfall of their adversaries, now returned to their ancient quarters; and burning for revenge on those who had banished them from the city, they practised various artifices, in order to rouse the popular fury against them. Every night the tocsin was sounded, and a report was propagated that the Armagnacs were at the gate with a powerful force to rescue the prisoners, and to massacre all the Burgundians in Paris \u2014 men, women, and children. When these alarms were proved to be false, it was confidently asserted that LTsle-Adam and his officers, instead of intending to bring the chief culprits to justice, had already been bribed into for bearance, and were only temporizing until an opportunity should occur for their release. On the night of the 12th of June the cry ran through Paris that the enemy were at the gates. A band of the lowest and most ferocious of the rabble assembled before the Hotel de Ville, and having been excited by an inflammatory harangue from a painter named Lambert, attempted to force the doors of the prison. LTsle-Adam threw himself before them with his soldiers, and endeavoured to pacify the ferocious mob. But they had now increased to forty or fifty thousand men, armed with mallets, hatchets, and maees, and were deaf to all appeals for justice or mercy. \" Away with your justice and reason,\" they cried; \"the Armagnacs are dogs ; they have ruined the kingdom of France, and sold it to the English. They have even prepared flags of the king of England to plant on the walls of Paris.\" The Burgundian leader was not disposed to encounter danger in resisting the blind fury of the rabble. He therefore withdrew his men, leaving the prisoners to the mercy of the bloodthirsty populace. The tower of the palace soon yielded to their violence, and among the miserable victims who were first dragged into its court and torn in pieces were an officer named Maureguon, the Chancellor Henri de Maule, and the In spite of the vigilance of Tannegui du Chatel the provost, and the cruelties per petrated by his troops, a conspiracy was secretly organized and successfully carried out. One of the gates of Paris was opened in the dead of night (28th May) to a small detachment of Burgundians, who were eagerly supported by the citizens as soon as they had penetrated into the streets. L'lsle-Adam, their commander, hastened to secure the person of the king, whom he paraded on horseback to and fro through tbe city, \" to make it appear to the ignorant that they had his sovereign's approbation for all that they were doing. \"f The Count D' Armagnac, roused by the tumult, dis guised himself, and sought concealment in the house of a mason ; but his hiding-place was discovered, and he was dragged to prison amid the execrations of the populace. Tannegui du Chatel had just sufficient time to snatch the dauphin from his bed, and hastily wrapping him in the coverlet, to carry him off to the Bastile, where he was afterwards joined by such of his partizans as had been equally fortunate in their escapes On the 11th of June Tannegui du Chatel made a sortie from the Bastile in the hope of recovering possession of the city ; but the populace fell upon him fiercely from all sides, and assailed him from their windows and house-tops, so that in the end the indomitable Breton was driven back to his stronghold with the loss of four hundred men. Despairing of the recovery of Paris, and thinking the Bastile no longer a place of safety, he carried the dauphin to the town of Bourges, leaving the fortress to its fate. Its little garrison, thus abandoned * Monstrelet, vol. v. c. 1. t See Appendix to Juvenal des Ursins.

The Armagnacs, finding a new leader in the heir apparent to the throne, had assumed the name of \"Dauphinois ;\" and between them and the duke of Burgundy, as well as be tween both parties and the English, a short suspension of arms was arranged as pre liminary to a more definite negotiation. The duke of Burgundy as representative of the king, who was incapacitated by a return of his disorder, held some confer- From the Hotel de Ville the mob repaired to the prisons of St. Eloi and of the Chatelet. At the latter they massacred the bishops of Coutances, of Senlis, of Bayeux, and of Evreux, two presidents of the Parliament, and several members of its different cham bers. No regard either to sex or age was shown by the murderous ruffians. In one instance, when some defence was attempted, the dungeons were fired, and their inmates were either suffocated or caught upon the points of spears as they leaped from the blazing roofs. The massacre lasted from four in the morning till ten on the follow ing day, and the number of the slain amounted to nearly three thousand. * ences with Henry V. near Meulan ; but after several meetings, conducted with a very rigid and scrupulous attention to form, the parties separated with mutual dissatisfaction. The reconciliation between Burgundy and the dauphin advanced with more seeming cordiality. The duke, in an interview at Pouilly, engaged to acknowledge the prince as the first personage in the realm after the king ; the prince treated the duke as his most faithful cousin and counsellor. They swore eternal friendship, with an oblivion of all past quarrels and differences, and con cluded a peace, the principal object of which was \" to resent the damnable enterprise of the English, the ancient enemies of the king, and of all Frenchmen.\" The queen and the duke of Burgundy made their triumphant entry into Paris on the 14th of July, and passed through streets literally wet with blood. In the middle of August the horrors of the massacre were renewed, and three hundred additional prisoners were murdered by the populace. The duke, however, now that his own chief enemies had been put to death, found it necessary to repress this ferocious spirit in order to preserve his own power ; and by a dexterous man\u0153uvre he contrived to seize and put to death a number of the leaders of the murderers, and to restore comparative order in the capital. The king of England meanwhile listened to the offers made by both factions, and amused both by negotia- tions, but all the time steadily pursued his scheme of conquest. Rouen, after a siege which lasted six months, and a most heroic resistance, was compelled to surrender almost at discretion. The fall of the capital of Normandy carried dismay into every quarter But the dauphin was surrounded by all that remained of the Armagnac faction \u2014 men trained to hatred of the very name of Burgundy, who had vowed revenge for the murder of the duke of Orleans, and whose nearest relatives had fallen in the late Parisian massacre. It was not possible that resent ment so deeply rooted could on a sudden be changed into sincere and cordial amity; and a deed of blood was meditated by them, which has seldom been exceeded in treachery. The Dauphin Charles was now approach ing his seventeenth year ; his intellect was narrow, and his temper fickle. To what extent he was implicated in the foul plot of his Armagnac retainers cannot be fully known, but it is not easy to acquit him of at least a criminal knowledge of their design. * Daru, Hist, de Bretagne, vol. ii. p. 248 ; Juvenal des Ursins, p. 350."], [398, "360 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1419-1420. Chiefly by tbe persuasion of his mistress, the lady of Geac, whom the conspirators had found means to gain over to their interests, the duke of Burgundy was reluctantly in duced to hold a second conference with the dauphin. The bridge at Montereau, where the Yonne meets the Seine, was selected as At the first announcement of this savage and treacherous murder, Philip, count of Charolois, the only son of John the Fearless, hastened from Ghent, and devoting himself to vengeance for this foul crime, determined to exclude the dauphin from the succession, and rather to transfer the crown to the brows of a foreign conqueror than to permit it to rest on those of his father's murderer. the place of meeting (10th September). In the centre of the bridge a barrier was fixed, and the approach on either side was so con structed as to admit the entrance of but a few attendants. Many of the old and faith ful servants of the duke endeavoured to dissuade their master from agreeing to this interview, seeing that the dauphin was wholly surrounded by his deadliest enemies. But John the Fearless declared that it was his duty to adventure his person for so great a blessing as that of peace. \" Whatever may happen,\" said he, \" I wish for peace ; if they kill me, I die a martyr.\" When he was about to mount his horse to keep his appointment, several of his servants tried to dissuade him ; and his family astrologer told him that if he went he would never return. But John Sans-peur vaulted into the saddle, and rode to Montereau, accompanied by an escort of four hundred men. When the princes met, they renewed their oath of mutual friendship. The place of meeting was a sort of gallery in the middle of the bridge, with a narrow door on either side. \" Here is what I trust in,\" said the duke, laying his hands on the shoulder of Tan negui du Chatel, who formed one of the dauphin's retinue. It was this very baron who first raised his hand against the duke, as he bared his head and bent his knee to Charles. He was speedily despatched by tbe bystanders, and one or two of his suite, who attempted to defend their master, shared his fate. The body of the murdered prince was sadly disfigured with wounds ; and the broad and deep cut on the head, which he received from the axe of Du Chatel, was afterwards called the door through which the English found their way into the heart of France.* A sort of family council ofthe Burgundian party was held, at which it was resolved to seek a close alliance with the king of Eng land. A similar step bad already been taken by the dauphin, but Henry saw clearly that it was for his interest to close with the offer made by the new duke of Burgundy. The preliminaries of peace were signed imme diately, and a formal treaty was soon after concluded, in which it was stipulated that Henry should receive the hand of the Prin cess Catherine, and that he should succeed to the throne of France on the death of the reigning sovereign. Even during the life of that prince, all virtual power was transferred to the English monarch as regent, who was to administer the government with no other restriction than the advice of a council and a pledge that he would maintain the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris and the privileges of the several orders of the state. The two crowns, when once united in Henry's pos session, were to remain so, indissolubly, to his successors, whether from Catherine or from any other stock ; but each kingdom was to enjoy its own national laws and usages. The subscribing parties bound themselves never to treat with Charles, \" the self-styled dauphin of Vienne,\" unless by common consent, and with the advice of the states-general ; and they assigned as their reason for this determination, \" the horrible and enormous crimes and offences which he had perpetrated.\"* A contract, formed at the point of the sword, and with a sovereign whose mind had long been a prey to insanity, could not have been held binding beyond the first * Juvenal des Ursins, p. 371. * Monstrelet, vol. v. c. 39."], [399, "A.d. 1420-1431.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 361 moment at which the power of breaking it returned. Besides, the union of two such kingdoms under one sceptre would soon have proved equally disadvantageous to both, as the one or the other must have been reduced to the condition of a province, and governed by a deputy. Nor could Henry have secured a firm basis for his power until he had crushed some of the best families in France, whose lineage, he could not be ignorant, was higher than his own, more especially those of Orleans, Alencon, Bre tagne, and Bourbon, all of wdiom stood nearer to the crown than the descendants of John of Gaunt. his coronation was celebrated with unprece dented magnificence. Before his departure \"a bed of justice\" had been held, at which the assassins of the late duke of Burgundy were declared guilty of high treason, and therefore incapable of inheritance. In the absence of Henry, the English met with a severe defeat by the Daupbinois at Bauges, in Anjou. The French were aided by some five thousand Scotch auxi liaries, and were commanded by John Stewart, earl of Buchan, high constable of France. They attacked the English in detail, while crossing the river Cananon by a narrow bridge, and defeated them with great slaughter. Thomas, duke of Clarence* (a brother of the king, who had been left in chief command), tbe earl of Kyme, and the Lord Roos, with nearly three thousand men, were slain in the combat. This reverse, and an intimation of general dis content, induced Henry to recross the Channel early in the summer. The chief events of the succeeding campaign were a battle won, after a most obstinate resistance, by the duke of Burgundy at Mons-en- Vimeu, which deprived the dauphin of all Picardyjf and the tedious and ultimately successful investment of Meaux, which occu pied the king of England till late in the following spring. The dauphin, who during that siege had retired into Languedoc, joined an army of twenty thousand men, which menaced the town of Cone, but was com pelled to give way before the confederates. This was the last triumph in which Henry V. shared. Impatient to take part in a battle which he expected would be fought for the relief of Cone, he repaired to the duke of Burgundy's camp, although an at tack of dysentery obliged him to use a litter as his conveyance. The fatigue increased his disorder, and after a few days' confine ment to bed in the castle of Vincennes, he expired with great calmness in the thirty- No apprehensions, however, seem to have been entertained at the time respecting the stability of the treaty and the permanence of the union of the crowns. The treaty was signed at Troves in the month of April, 1420, by the imbecile Charles, under the direction ofthe queen and the duke of Burgundy; and at the end of the same month it was accepted, without the slightest opposition, by the Par liament, the Chamber of Accounts, the university, the chapter, the provost, the municipality, and all the corporate bodies of Paris. In the month of May Henry marched to Troyes with a splendid retinue and a detachment of his army amounting to seven thousand men. On the 20th he was affianced to the Princess Catherine in the church of St. Peter, in the presence of the king and queen of France, and a great body of the peers and prelates of the kingdom. On the following day the treaty was ratified with marked eagerness and apparent cordiality, and oaths of fidelity were taken to Henry as regent ; and on the 2nd of June he received the hand of the princess in the church of St. John at Troyes. Two days after the consummation of his marriage, he proceeded with his bride and the duke of Burgundy to the siege and easy conquest of Sens; Montereau next yielded, and Melun after a longer defence. In the course of December the two kings made their entry into Paris, and Henry soon afterwards returned with his queen to England, where * The duke was nnhorsed by Sir John Swinton, of Swinton, who distinguished him by a coronet, set with pre cious stones, which he wore around his helmet.

The funeral of the deceased king was per formed in St. Denis with great pomp, although without the attendance of any prince of the blood ; and when the herald had invoked God's mercy for his soul, according to the customary form, he finished by proclaiming the accession of the English prince. \" May God grant long life to Henry, by the grace of God king of France and of England, our sovereign lord !\" which cry he again repeated. The sergeants-at-arms and ushers then returned their maces, and shouted together, \" Long live the king ! long live the king I\" * fourth year of his age, and tenth of his reign (31st August, 1422). Shortly before his death he called his relations and confidential friends around his bed; confided to their loyalty the care of his infant son, whom Catherine had recently born, and who was regarded as the heir of both monarchies; and gave instructions for the prosecution of the war, as well as for the management of affairs at home. To bis brother, the duke of Bedford, was com mitted the perilous regency of France, in case the office should be declined by the duke of Burgundy, the diligent culti vation of whose friendship formed the burden of often-reiterated advice to the nobles who surrounded his deathbed. The remains of the deceased conqueror were conveyed with extraordinary pomp to Eng land. More than ten weeks were consumed in the progress from Vincennes to London ; the body was then consigned to its resting place in Westminster Abbey, with greater expense and magnificence than had been exhibited in the funeral of any king of England for two hundred years past ; \" and even now,\" adds the chronicler, \" as much honour and reverence is daily paid to his tomb as if he were a saint in paradise.\" The name of Henry V. stands conspi cuous on the roll of English sovereigns, especially of those who have been distin guished for brilliant conquests and success ful ambition. But he had many fine qualities besides those of a mere warrior and con queror. His treatment ofthe French people after the battle of Agincourt, and the arrangements which he made for the govern ment of the conquered provinces, prove that he was a statesman of consummate skill. It must be admitted, however, that he was severe and unrelenting, and even cruel on some occasions ; and his persecution of the Lollards is a great and ineffaceable blot on his character. Charles VI. outlived his son-in-law but a few weeks, when a quartan fever termi nated his miserable life and most disastrous reign. He had worn the crown forty-two years out of the fifty-four which he had attained. France, however, gained little by this deliverance from the rule of an imbe cile king, for her throne was still to be the subject of dispute between the supporters of an infant prince yet in his cradle and those of a disinherited heir of ripe age, but sullied with the imputation of perfidy and murder. As Henry's time was generally occupied in war, he had little leisure to devote to the arts of peace and the duties of legislation ; but so far as his opportunities extended, he showed himself the steady friend of justice, and also of such liberty as his people were pre pared to enjoy. He intrusted to Parliament greater powers than they were disposed on all occasions to exercise ; and, in return for their liberal grants, he was willing to confer privileges upon them to the full extent of their desires. His early death, too, endeared him to the affections of his subjects; and, accordingly, few sovereigns have descended into the tomb followed by more abundant love and admiration than Henry V. At the death of Charles VI. the English o were in actual possession of the Isle of France, parts of Maine and Anjou, nearly the whole of Champagne, Picardy, and Normandy, Guienne, and Gascony. Their alliance with the duke of Burgundy gave them the resources of his French provinces * .Monstrelet, vol. vi. c. 1."], [401, "A.d. 1422.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 363 the alarm bells were rung, and the labourers fled into the towns; even the very cattle, it is said, had learned a sort of instinct which taught them to take to flight. Meanwhile, theft and robbery were the only occupation of the many houseless wretches who could find no other means of subsistence. Sir John Fortescue, who attended the young king in one of his visits to Normandy, remarks that, compared to England, all the country through which he travelled was a desert ; the peasantry had forsaken their abodes ; the aspect of nature had become wild; and even the richest portions of the territory had been relinquished to savage beasts and the fowls of the air.* Henry VI. \u2014 a.d. 1422-1471 The heir of the great monarch whose premature death we have just recorded, succeeded to the possession of a throne which bad pretensions to a more extensive sovereignty than any other in Europe at the same period. A few years more of the warlike talent and vigorous administration which distinguished the government of Henry V., would have completed the con quest of France, and probably have given rise to a new dynasty of kings in that powerful country. But the infant who inherited his sceptre was doomed to witness a miserable reverse ; to see the English expelled from the land which, during several generations, they had occupied as friends or as masters; and to feel the crown pass from his own head to that of a rival prince, who had defied him in the field of battle. It has been already stated that Henry V. on his deathbed recommended to the care of his brothers the education and govern ment of his infant son ; intending that the duke of Bedford should continue to direct the affairs of France, and that Gloucester should charge himself with the regency at home. To provide for the emergency to which the demise of the king had given rise, certain peers, spiritual and temporal, assembled at Westminster, issued commis sions in the name of Henry VI. to the judges and sheriffs, to continue the exercise of their respectives offices until a Parliament should be holdcn and a regular administra tion established. The first step taken by the legislature was to appoint the duke of Gloucester \" protector of the realm and church of England;\" imagining that, under that title, they were conferring a less dan gerous authority than might be assumed by a prince of the blood if invested with the prerogatives of a regent. A council of state was nominated consisting of twenty mem bers, of which the duke of Bedford was president, or, in his absence, the lord pro tector of the kingdom. Grants were made for the ordinary wants of the crown, and duties were imposed or continued, that the sources of revenue might not be allowed to dry up.f At the accession of Henry VI., who was proclaimed king of both countries, all tbe provinces of France situated towards the west and north were held in his name ; even the capital acknowledged his title ; and only the central and more southern districts adhered to the cause of the dauphin, who by the death of his father soon afterwards became Charles VII. The indecision, however, which usually marks the begin- ning of a royal minority, was favourable to the latter prince, who could not without shame and sorrow see the finest parts of his dominions in the hands of strangers, whose claims, in fact, extended to the whole as the rightful owners. The long protracted strife, too, of which their native land had been the theatre, had reduced the people to the utmost wretchedness. Northward of the Loire the country had become one vast solitude; the fields were deserted, and no men were to be found except in forests or strongholds; even the cities were rather garrisons for soldiers than dwelling-places for the inhabitants. The cultivation of the soil was abandoned except around the walls, or under the ram parts, or within sight of the sentinel in his tower. As soon as an enemy was discovered \u2022 Barante, p. 204.

[a.d. 1422-1423 In order to put an end to the friendly intercourse between Charles VII. and the duke of Albany, the regent of Scotland, who saw with pleasure the ardour with which his countrymen engaged to serve against the English, it was now resolved to liberate James, wdio had been nineteen years a captive, and to permit him to return home. Considering that he was seized in time of peace, and while he was yet a child, a greater degree of generosity might have been expected, than was exhibited by the demand of a sum of money as a compensa tion for the expenses incurred during his detention, in name of education, board, and clothing.* Eager to recover his liberty, the youthful monarch did not hesitate to accept the terms, however hard or unjust. Before his departure, he married Jane, a daughter of the earl of Somerset \u2014 a lady of rare accomplishments, and to whom his affections had been long directed ; upon which occasion the protector, with the consent ofthe council, remitted a part of the sum which the prince had stipulated to pay for his freedom, but which his subjects were too poor or too indignant ever to advance. were few qualities likely to attract esteem. Deficient in energy rather than in intellect, he weakly abandoned himself to favouritism, and at a season which especially demanded the superintendence of a single dominant mind, he was contented to act at the plea sure and under the guidance of others. Unable to organize an army of regular native troops sufficient in numbers to keep the field against the English, Charles col lected around him a herd of needy adven turers, tempted by the hope of immediate spoil, or by the promise of exorbitant future reward. Part of this mercenary force was composed of Lombards and Spaniards; but the great body consisted of Scottish aux iliaries who belonged to a higher class, and produced considerable impression on the for tune of the war. They were led, as we have already mentioned, by the earl of Buchan, and by Archibald, earl of Douglas (the cele brated Tyneman or Loseman), who received a yet more solid recompense than had been bestowed upon his countrymen, for a sub sidiary force of six thousand men which he had furnished. In spite of strong opposition expressed by the ancient nobles, who con sidered their order tarnished by the admis sion of \"a barbarian\" to share its honours, Douglas was created Duke of Touraine. France was now desolated by a war of partizanship; the face of the country was covered by independent bands supporting themselves on pillage, and adopting the names of the chief belligerents principally as an excuse for freebooting. By the people at large, indeed, it was impossible that attachment could be entertained for either claimant. Strong national prejudice and a sense of wounded pride must have induced them to regard the yoke of foreign conquest, and submission to an infant king, with a not unwarrantable reluctance, which neither the wisdom nor the equity displayed by the duke of Bedford in his regency was sufficient to dispel. But in the personal character of Charles, even if the murder of the duke of Burgundy could have been forgotten, there In his first military efforts, however, the new king was eminently unsuccessful. His constable was defeated and taken prisoner, after the loss of an eye, at Crevant on the Yonne, and many of his chief officers shared his fate. Monstrelet thus describes this disaster: \u2014 \"The English and Burgundians won the day and the field ; the greater part of the Scots, amounting to three thousand, who were in the front ranks, were either killed or taken.\" * Next year the remnant of the Scottish auxiliaries bore the brunt of the battle of Verneuil (August 17, 1424). \" This,\" says Dr. Burton, \"is one of the many battles in which defeat has been attributed to mis understandings and mistakes among allies; for there were men of three nations on * Rymer, vol. x. pp. 293, 290.

Wherever the blame lay, the penalty was paid by the Scots, of whom all but a few lay dead where they fought. It has been said that their fate was of their own seek ing; for, on meeting face to face with their mortal enemies of England, they sent Bed ford a message that they would neither spare nor be spared \u2014 neither give nor take quarter. Buchan, the high constable, and Douglas, the duke of Touraine, were found among the dead. They had not given their fives an utterly vain sacrifice to the cause of their adoption. Though Verneuil is counted among the English victories, it had no resemblance to the sweeping triumphs of Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. It wyas so tough an affair, and was so near to the defeat of Bedford and Salisbury, that they became really alarmed about the stability of the supremacy of the house of Lancaster in France.\" * produced irreparable mischief to his country by their short-lived affection. The duchess, inadequately defended and neglected in her application for assistance, was compelled to cede the administration of her provinces to the duke of Burgundy and declare him her heir, on the assignment of a pension. On her death, in 1436, her territories passed undisputed into the possession of the duke. Bedford, who was readily acknowledged as regent ofthe English territories in France, conducted matters with great prudence, though he could not fail to perceive that no degree of wisdom or energy would long avert the fate with which his power in those provinces was menaced. In the second year of the new reign, certain differences had broken out in the government at home, which required his presence for their adjust ment. The bishop of Winchester, grand uncle of the king, was intrusted with the person and education of the royal boy ; but being a prelate whose ambition was at least equal to his distinguished talents, he aspired to act a leading part in the management of public affairs, His nephew, the protector, unwilling to sacrifice his judgment to the will of an imperious churchman, opposed him with no small resolution and acrimony ; and, at length, their private quarrels were carried so far that Parliament found it expe dient to interpose, and to bind both of them to abstain from violating the public peace. But the parties who owned these powerful men as their leaders still ardently pursued their separate objects, and threw the nation into great trouble. The losses in France increased daily ; province after province revolted or was subdued ; many of the prin cipal towns were taken, or surrendered by fraud ; the spirit of the soldiers had evapo rated in the presence of an enemy whom they were wont to contemn ; and, in the meantime, the violence of faction in the councils ofthe country prevented all recourse to the proper means for remedying such evils. The popularity of Gloucester, and his near relation to the sovereign, gave him advantages in the contest with his more This disaster appeared likely to reduce Charles to extremity, when a seasonable dissension among his enemies averted the menaced ruin. Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, a younger brother of the duke of Bedford and uncle to the infant king, espoused Jacqueline, heiress of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Friesland, and embarked a considerable force for the Netherlands in order to establish his marital claim on these provinces. He was opposed, however, by the duke of Burgundy, who embraced the cause of his kinsman the duke of Brabant, from whom Jacqueline had recently been divorced. The wise interference of Bedford, who foresaw the ruin of the English cause in the alienation of so important an ally as the duke of Bur gundy, proved unavailing, and through the rashness of Gloucester a bitter war was commenced in Hainault. But the fickle Gloucester in a very short time returned to England, leaving Jacqueline in the Nether lands ; and in the attractions of his mistress, Eleanor Cobham, he forgot his ambitious views on his wife's inheritance, after having * The Scot Abroad, vol i. p. 4 1."], [404, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. a.d. 1427-1428 366 wily antagonist ; but the warmth of his temper, which knew no restraint, often carried him to sacrifice all he had gained, and to expose his interests to a formidable opposition,* any immediate apprehension of the deser- tion of his great ally the duke of Burgundy, determined to renew with vigour the mili- tary operations against Charles which had for some time been suspended. Six thousand of the best troops which England could furnish had disembarked at Calais, under the command of Montagu, the gallant earl of Salisbury; and these, when united with the forces of Lords Scales and Talbot, and of the duke of Suffolk, were marched to the Loire, preparatory to the siege of Orleans. This city commanded the passage of the Loire, and was the key to the southern pro- vinces. Both from its size and its situation, it was the most important stronghold which yet remained in the possession of the French king. The English as well as the French felt that here the last struggle must be made for national independence, and every effort was made to put the city into a state of defence. Salisbury lost many weeks in reducing Rambouillet, Pithiviers, Jargeau, Sully, and other small towns in the neigh- bourhood, so that it was not till the 12th of October that he invested the city. The Sire de Gaucourt, a brave and skilful officer, and assisted by two of the principal captains of the age, Pothon de Xaintrailles and Dunois, an illegitimate son of the late duke of Orleans (a young hero who two years before had defeated the English at Mon targis), made every preparation for a re solute defence. The garrison consisted of about sixteen hundred soldiers, among whom were counted many distinguished knights. The inhabitants, too, who were determined to defend the place to the last extremity, had provided themselves with all sorts of warlike instruments, had exercised themselves in the use of arms, and had voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount. Though untrained to war, they exhibited proofs of valour and devotion which no troops, however choicely disci plined, could surpass. They cheerfully consented that the suburb on the southern bank of the river should be razed to the ground; and the vineyards, trees, and gar- Meanwhile, France continued a prey to continual feuds and factions. Arthur, count of Richemont, brother of the duke of Brit tany, who had been appointed to the vacant office of constable, was indignant at the conduct of the king's ignoble favourites, and resolved to rid the court of them by the most atrocious measures. The chief of these was the Sire de Giac, who with his wife was deeply implicated in the murder of the duke of Burgundy at Montereau. The con stable seized him by night in his bed, and delivered him over to George de la Tre mouille, who caused him to be thrown into the river at Dun-le-Roi, with a large stone tied to his neck. Camus de Beaulieu, who succeeded to the dangerous post of chief favourite, was stabbed in open day by some men employed by the constable and the marshal of Boussac. Richemont then recom mended to the king George de la Tremouille, whom he supposed to be entirely devoted to his interest; but he soon discovered that the new minion, who obtained complete ascendancy over the king, was disposed to look exclusively to his own ends. Enraged at this defection, the constable formed a league against La Tremouille, and sought to destroy him. Charles on this passed a sen tence of banishment against the constable, who thereupon, in conjunction with several princes of the blood, took up arms against the king. In these circumstances no pro gress was made in expelling the invaders, who threatened to carry their arms beyond the Loire. The success of his arms in Hol land, and the submission of the Countess Jacqueline, conciliated the duke of Bur gundy, who now again became friendly to the English, and promised to send them a reinforcement of troops to assist in the reduction of the country beyond the Loire.

Battle of Herrings,\" because herrings and other salt fish formed a principal part of the provisions which Sir John was conveying to the English army.* The first assault of the English was directed on a strong tower which defended the approach to the bridge on the southern bank of the Loire. This bulwark was carried after a stubborn resistance. The besiegers then directed their attack against two towers which had been built, one on each side the passage, some way forward upon the bridge. These were stormed by Sir William Gladsdale, one of the most experienced officers in the English army, who waded with his men through the river, and drove out the defenders. A few days after this important success, the earl of Salisbury while surveying the walls from this spot, called the Tournelles, was wounded in the face by a splinter broken from the casement by a cannon ball, and died after a week. His successor, William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, pressed the siege vigor ously; and much encouragement was derived from the total rout of tbe French, almost in the moment of victory, when they had nearly intercepted a convoy of provisions destined for the camp. The battle took place (12th February, 1429) near to the village of Rouvrai, between Genville and Orleans. Sir John Fastolfe. who commanded the convoy, having learned that an army of French and Scots, greatly superior in numbers, occupied the road before him, formed a square with his carts and waggons, leaving only the openings in which he posted his archers, the men-at-arms drawn up behind to support them. In this advantageous position he waited the attack of the enemy. The brunt of the conflict fell upon the Scots, the main body of the French never having charged at all. After a fierce struggle, Fastolfe gained a complete victory. Six hundred of his antagonists, nearly all Scots, were left upon the field, along with their leader, the constable of Scotland, and his son Sir William Stewart. The sires of Rochecourt, d'Albret, and other French lords, shared their fate. This battle was called \"the The siege of Orleans had by this time been converted into a blockade. The city was gradually surrounded with forts or \" bastilles,\" which to a large extent shut out reinforcements and supplies of provisions, and reduced the garrison and the citizens to great straits. Famine now stared the Orlcanois in the face, and the news of the defeat of their friends in the \" Battle of Herrings\" filled them with despair. Little help was to be expected from the easy, indolent, pleasure-loving monarch who then claimed, rather than occupied, the throne of France. At the news of the shameful disaster which had befallen his arms, he was recommended by his courtiers to leave Orleans to its fate, and to retire with the remains of his forces into the provinces of Dauphine or Langucdoc. Happily for his country and for himself, be was diverted from a step so pregnant with ruin and disgrace, according to some authorities, by the remon strance of his high-minded queen, Mary of Anjou ; as others say, by the taunts of his mistress, Agnes Sorel.f Both, perhaps, may have contributed their share to fortify his sinking resolution ; but it was to a woman yet more remarkable than either of them that he was ultimately indebted for the security of his crown. While the king was still hesitating as to the course which he should adopt, de spatches arrived at Chinon from the Sieur Baudricourt, lord of Vaucoulcurs in Cham pagne, requesting an audience for a peasant girl, who affirmed that she had important communications for the royal ear. Joan d'Arc was a native of the hamlet of Dom remy, the daughter of poor but respectable parents, and at the time at which she first attracted notice had just completed her six teenth year.

It has always kindly guarded me, and I understand very well what it announces.\" from legend in the great mass of particulars recorded of her history ; but it is plain that a very glowing imagination had been early excited, both by the political distresses of her country, and by the romantic tradi tions with which her own neighbourhood abounded. All France was divided by faction : the inhabitants of Domremy espoused the royal cause; those of a vil lage adjoining were staunch English and Burgundians. Even children shared these sentiments of their elders, and Joan had often witnessed the boyish conflicts in which her brothers engaged for the maintenance of their party. Dim hopes, also, might visit her fancy from the recollection of a prophecy current in her district, that France was one day to be delivered by a virgin from the borders of Lorraine. She had been in the habit, moreover, of resorting to a favourite spot, near her house, which superstition represented as a haunt of the fairies; and while wreathing nosegays and flowers under the Lady's-tree in the Bois Chesun, unconsciously to herself she might imbibe or encourage a taste for supernatural agency. The \" voices \" which she heard most frequently were those of St. Catherine and St. Margaret, and they warned her that she was a chosen instrument by which the siege of Orleans should be raised, and the king should celebrate his coronation at Rheims. When she had found means of communi cating with Baudricourt, and of requesting his assistance to forward her design, he treated the application with ridicule. Her importunity at length wrung from the stern old warrior a reluctant consent to write and refer the question of her journey to the decision of the king himself. She seems to have made little or no impression on the mind of Baudricourt, but her piety, sim plicity, and earnestness converted several other persons in the town of Vaucouleurs to a belief in her pretensions. One of these, a gentleman named Jean de Novelempont, and surnamed de Metz, afterwards deposed on oath to these transactions. \" Child,\" said he, as he met her in the street, \" what are you doing here? Must we not submit to seeing the king expelled his kingdom, and to ourselves becoming English.\" \" I am come here,\" said the maid, \"to ask of the sire de Baudricourt to send me before the dauphin: he has no care for me or for words of mine; and yet it is needful that before mid-Lent I should stand in the dau phin's presence, should I even in reaching him wear through my feet, and have to crawl upon my knees. For no one upon this earth, neither king nor duke, nor daughter of the king of Scots,* no one but myself, is appointed to recover this realm of France. Yet I should more willingly remain to spin by the side of my poor mother, for war seems no work for me. But go I must, because the Lord my master so wills it.\" \"And who is the Lord your master?\" said de Metz. \" The king ofheaven,\" she replied. Upon a disposition naturally pensive and affectionate, religion operated deeply as her mind expanded to its contemplation ; and she became remarkable for attention to all offices of devotion. A peculiarity of phy sical temperament no doubt contributed, when her childhood ceased, to disorder a fancy which had never encountered discip line or restraint. Her own answers to the interrogatories proposed by her judges at a later season afford the simplest and most certain account of her pretensions. \" At the age of thirteen,\" she said, \" I had a voice of God to assist me to govern myself. It came at noon, in summer, in my father's garden. I had not fasted the day before. I heard it on my right hand, towards the church. I was greatly frightened. I rarely hear it without seeing a great brilliancy on the side it comes from. I thought it came from heaven. When I had heard it three times, I knew that it was the * There was pending at this time a negotiation for a mar riage between the dauphin Louis, son of Charles VII., and the daughter of the king of Scots, who promised to send fresh succours."], [407, "a.d. 1429.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 369 De Metz declared that he was convinced by her tone of enthusiasm, and promised on the faith of a gentleman that he would con duct her to the king. His friend Bertrand de Poulangi also became a believer in Joan's mission; and Baudricourt at last, yielding rather to the force of public opinion than to his own conviction, gave permission to De Metz and De Poulangi to conduct the maid to Charles. at once selected and addressed him with becoming reverence, bending her knee and explaining the object of her application. If it be true that after the conversation which ensued when he took her apart, he declared that she had proved the reality of her divine mission by reminding him of a fact known only to God and to himself, we for the first time detect an appearance of artifice; in which, however, it by no means follows that Joan was implicated.* Cooler heads might have perceived that it was possible to give an advantageous direction to her enthusiasm, and accordingly they might have undertaken the delicate task of secretly ministering to its pilotages Joan set forth from Vaucouleurs on the 13th of February, 1429, the day after the \" Battle of Herrings \" was fought, with an escort of six persons. Her journey through a wide tract of hostile country was not only laborious but dangerous, exposed as she was to fall in every moment with wandering parties of the enemy, or to ford deep rivers, and to thread extensive forests, in order to avoid them. Joan, however, happily sur mounted all these dangers, and having reached the village of St. Catherine de Fier bois, a few leagues from Chinon, where Charles then held his court, here she halted, and sent a message to the king to announce her arrival and her object. This suspicion is confirmed by the great pains which were evidently taken to noise abroad her appearance and designs. Some time was necessarily demanded before full preparation for the relief of Orleans could be completed ; and during that interval re ports were diligently circulated that an aid more than human was about to succour the besieged city. The hopes of the garrison were elevated by the prospect of assistance which they readily believed to be divine ; and on the other hand, no little terror was excited among their enemies by a prevalent opinion that the powers of darkness had banded together for their destruction. To the operation of these conflicting sentiments, no doubt, many of the succeeding events are to be attributed. Charles, after a slight demur, granted the requested audience, and it is far from improbable that the sole object of the care less prince (who had already been told by the brave La Hire that \"no one could trifle away a kingdom more gaily\") was to amuse himself with the embarrassment of his rustic suitor. More than three hundred knights were assembled by torchlight in the ban queting-had into which she was led, and the king, far less richly attired than many of his courtiers, had designedly mingled in their ranks in order that he might remain undistin\"-uished. But he miscalculated the o powers of the m'nd with which he had to deal. Joan's loyalty was a passion, and her imagination had not dwelt so long and so earnestly upon a mere phantom. By pictures, by the impress upon his coinage, or by verbal description, she had acquired intimate acquaintance with the features of Charles ; and greatly to the astonishment both of himself and of the bystanders she After the ecclesiastics had assured them selves of her orthodoxy, and the noble matrons ofthe court had attested her claims to maiden purity (preliminaries thought necessary in order to clear her from the im putation of Satanic influence), she received authority to proceed to Orleans. As she wore male attire, the king presented her with a suit of armour ; and having been * Charles afterwards revealed this secret to the sire de Boissy, one of his favourites. Joan, it appears, had said to him these words \u2014 \" I tell you on behalf of God, that you arc the true and real heir of France.\" The king, it seems, when alone in his oratory a little time before, had prayed that if he was indeed the true heir of the kingdom, heaven would defend him. f Hist, of England during the Middle Ages, vol. ii. p. 538. 47"], [408, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

A sudden change of wind, however, prevented the flotilla from remounting the stream, and the prestige of Joan was very materially increased by the necessity thus induced of resorting to the original design of crossing the Loire and of marching up its right bank to the city gates. It is obvious from this account that Suffolk had altogether neglected blockade by water, and that even on land his posts were so widely separated or so carelessly sentinelled that they might be penetrated without de tection. early accustomed to horseback, she was a fearless rider. She would have no sword but one marked with five crosses, which she was said to have miraculously discovered in a tomb behind the high altar in the church of St. Catherine at Fierbois. Her standard was white, dotted with the fleurs-de-lis of France, which was framed under express direction of her \"voices.\" It represented the Saviour seated in judgment, and was blazoned with the words \" Jhesus Maria.\" Amid all these investigations and prepar ations two months passed away. Charles himself had evidently no confidence in the mission of Joan, but the mass of the people firmly believed that she had been divinely raised up to effect the deliverance of France. A convoy of provisions was collected at Blois ; and when Joan repaired thither about the middle of April, accompanied by the mareschal de Boussac, the admiral de Culant, La Hire, and other valiant captains, men flocked from all quarters to obtain a sight of the inspired maiden, and buckled on their arms anew for the cause of France. Nearly six thousand men were thus assem bled; and the appearance of Joan as she made her entry into Blois (mounted on a snow-white steed and in complete armour, but her head uncovered), her tall and grace ful figure, and the skill with which she rode her palfrey and poised her lance, excited the utmost enthusiasm among the specta tors. She immediately set about reforming the morals of the soldiers; she expelled all the camp-followers, and made the men-at arms confess their sins and take the sacra ment. Preceded by her holy banner borne aloft by her confessor, Father Pasquerel, and accompanied by all the priests of Blois, she walked evening and morning through the town, chanting hymns, and calling sin ners to repentance. At a late hour on the night of the 29th of April, Joan made her entry into Orleans, accompanied by La Hire and two hundred lances, amid thunder and lightning, and a raging storm. The citizens, roused almost from the depths of despair, pressed around their deliverer with loud acclamations, and eagerly strove to touch her armour, her holy standard, or the white charger which she rode. Late as was the hour, she re paired first to the cathedral, where \" Te Deum\" was chanted by torchlight. She then repaired to the house of a lady of high character, which she had chosen for her dwelling. A splendid banquet had been prepared for her, but she refused to partake of it, and made her repast upon a piece of bread dipped in wine and water. The presence of Joan in Orleans in creased the strong feeling of confidence which the report of her approach had gene rated. The dignity of her person, the stead fastness of her courage, the purity of her manners, the fervour of her devotion, her abstemiousness, her mixture of gentleness and of command, alike tended to elevate her above the ordinary human standard, and to create a persuasion in the besieged that they were visited by a holy messenger, who had the power of working miracles in their be half. On the fourth day after her arrival the new convoy came in sight by way of The convoy which Joan was intrusted to escort from Blois to Orleans proceeded con trary to her wishes, and even without her knowledge, but at the suggestion of the more tried military experience of Dunois, along the left bank of the Loire.

The English kept within their lines, and made no attempt to hinder its standing on end!'\" Riding at full speed through the streets, she reached the scene of conflict to find that the French had been progress ; and the long line of waggons, flocks, and herds, entered the city un molested. repulsed. She instantly resolved to head a fresh attack in person, and waving her white banner aloft, she called to those around to That same afternoon a detachment of the garrison and citizens, elated by their suc- cess, made a sally against one of the English bastilles. Joan, after bringing in the con- voy, had retired to rest, and no intimation ofthe fight had been sent her by the chiefs. We will give the story in the words of M. de Barante, as compiled from the depo- sitions of D'Aulon, her esquire, and of Father Pasquerel, her chaplain: \u2014 \"The day had been a weary one ; Joan threw her- self on her bed and tried to sleep, but she was disturbed in mind. All of a sudden she called out to the sire d'Aulon, her esquire, ' My council tells me to march against the English, but I no not know whether it should be against their bastille or against this Fascot (Fastolf). You must arm me.' The sire d'Aulon began accord- ingly to put on her armour. During this time she heard a great noise in the street, the cry being that the enemy were at that very moment inflicting great hurt upon the French. ' My God,' she exclaimed, ' the blood of our people is flowing ! Why was I not wakened sooner? Oh, that was ill done ! My arms ! my arms ! my horse ! ' Leaving behind her esquire, who had not yet clad himself in armour, she hastened down stairs, and she found her page loiter- ing before the door. ' You wicked boy,' she cried, ' why did you not come to tell me that the blood of France is being shed? Quick, quick ! my horse !' Her horse was brought ; she desired that her banner which she had left in the house might be reached out to her from the window; and without further delay she set forth, hastening towards the Porte Bourgogne, from wdience the din of battle seemed to come. When she had nearly reached it, she beheld carried by her . one of the townsmen grievously wounded, i 'Alas,' said she, ' never have I seen the s blood of Frenchmen flow without my hair follow her. After a desperate struggle, which lasted three hours, the bastille called St. Loup was stormed, and in spite of the remonstrances of the Maid, nearly the whole of the defenders were put to the sword. Two days later, 6th May, the French leaders, accompanied by the Maid, attacked the Bastille des Augustins, on the southern shore. The conflict was very severe, and at one period the assailants were put to flight. Joan was borne along by the fugi- tives, but at last succeeded in rallying them, and waving aloft her banner, led them back to the attack. The English, terrified at the sight of the sorceress, as they deemed her, and her magical banner, retreated and sought shelter behind their bulwarks. The French, strengthened by fresh reinforce- ments, made another assault on the fort, which was successful : the garrison were put to the sword, and the bastille set in flames. Only a single fort now remained, on the opposite shore, in the hands of the English. It was named the Bastille des Tournelles, and was the strongest of all \u2014 confronting the broken bridge on the one side, and on the other defended by a formidable bulwark and a deep ditch filled with water from the Loire. Above all, it was garrisoned by Sir William Gladsdale and his bravest troops. The governor of Orleans, the sire de Gau- court, and the other French captains, wished to postpone their attack on this formidable stronghold until they should receive further reinforcements, but Joan insisted upon an immediate assault. \" You have been to your council,\" she said, \"and I have been to mine. Be assured that tbe council of the Lord will hold good, and that the council of man will perish.\" The governor with some soldiers stationed himself before the gate through which Joan would have to"], [410, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1429. 372 pass, and refused to unbar it. But they were compelled to yield to her persistency and the vehemence of the people, who threatened to tear Gaucourt to pieces. Find ing the attack inevitable, the French lead ers determined to take part in it, and along with Joan crossed the Loire in boats to attack the Tournelles on the opposite side. Notwithstanding the fury of the assault, Gladsdale and his men, who were the flower of the English army, made a desperate, and for a time an effective resistance. They poured upon the French a close and well sustained discharge both from bows and sire-arms, and overthrew with hatchets, pikes, and mallets, the scaling ladders placed against the ramparts. The conflict, which began at ten in the morning, had now lasted till noon, when the Maid, seeing that the soldiers had become disheartened at the failure of their efforts, seized a scaling ladder, and planting it against the wall, began to ascend. At that critical moment she was wounded in the neck by an arrow, and fell back into the fosse. She was immediately carried to the rear, and a few natural tears were wrung from her by intense bodily suffering and mental emotion. But enthu siasm soon resumed the ascendancy. After a short repose she plucked the arrow from the wound with her own hands, staunched the blood, and after some moments passed in silent prayer, hastened back to the assault. The troops, who had suspended the conflict during her absence, and had been greatly discouraged by her wound, renewed the attack with fresh ardour. The English, on the other hand, were astounded at the sudden appearance of one whom they had seen struck down, as they believed, mortally wounded. A superstitious panic spread, and some of them even supposed that they saw the forms of the archangel Michael, and of Aiguan the patron saint of Orleans, riding on white horses, and fight ing on the side of the French, At this crisis the danger and the terror of the bewildered garrison were increased, by an attack made by a party of the citizens from the broken bridge on the other side of the fort. Their indomitable chief resolved to withdraw from the outer bulwarks, and to concentrate his force within the towers themselves. But at the moment when he was crossing the drawbridge, a cannon ball from the French batteries broke it asunder, and Gladsdale and his best soldiers perished in the stream. The fort was then captured without further resistance, and the remnant of the garrison, two hundred in number, yielded themselves prisoners of war. The loss of the besiegers in these several engagements had been numerically severe ; and with the few and dispirited troops who now remained to them, the conquest of Orleans, which but a fortnight before had appeared certain, was now utterly hopeless. Veterans whom no peril of human combat could appal quailed before \"this creature in the form of a woman,\" and refused an unequal encounter \"with the disciple and limb of the fiend that used false enchant ment and sorcery.\" On the morning after the loss of the Toumelles (8th May), the English army broke up, abandoned their lines, set fire to the remaining forts, the fruit of many months' toilsome exertions, and dispersed themselves through the neigh bouring garrisons. The first part of Joan's ministry was thus executed, and she refused to engage in pursuit of the enemy, who retired in perfect order, with their colours flying (May 8, 1429). The Maid of Orleans, as she was now honourably termed, had thus fulfilled, in the short space of seven days, the first part of her promise, the raising of the siege of Orleans ; but the second part of her extra ordinary enterprise, the crowning of the king at Rheims, remained yet to be accom plished within a few days. She appeared before Charles at Tours to report in person her marvellous success, and to entreat him to trust still further to her guidance, and enable her to complete her mission. Her very words have been recorded in a chron icle, written, probably, the same year: \u2014 \" When Joan, the maid, was before the"], [411, "a.d. 1429.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 373 king, she kneeled down and clasped him by the feet, saying, ' Gentle dauphin, come and receive your noble crown at Rheims; I am greatly pressed that you should go there; do not doubt that you will there be worthily crowned as you ought.' It happened then that the king in his own thoughts, and also three or four of the chief men and captains around him, deemed it would be right, if not displeasing to the said Joan, to inquire what her voices had said to her. She saw their thoughts, and said, ' In the name of God, I know right well what you think, and desire to ask me, of the voice which I beard speak touching your being crowned, and I will ted you truly. I had set myself to prayer, as I am wont to do, and I was complaining because I was not believed in what I had said, and then I heard the voice declare, \" Daughter, go forward ; I will be thy helper, go !\" and when that voice comes to me, I feel so joyful as is wondrous to tell!' And while speaking these words, she raised her eyes towards heaven with every sign of gladness and exultation.\" from Selles to go to Romorantin, three leagues forward on the enemy's side, having with her the mareschal de Boussac and much folk, both men in arms and of the commonalty. There I saw her on horse back, clad all in blank armour save her head, with a small axe in her hand, and mounted on a great black charger, who, at the door of her dwelling, was prancing and rearing, and would not allow her to mount; upon which she said, ' Take him to the cross which stands before the church near to the road.' And after this she mounted without further hinderance, for the horse grew as quiet as though he had been bound. And then she turned towards the church-door, which was nigh, and said in a clear woman's voice, ' Ye priests and churchmen, do ye make procession and prayers to God.' She then pursued her journey, saying, ' Go for ward, go forward !' Her banner was folded and borne by a well-favoured page ; her small axe was in her hand, and a brother of hers, who has joined her eight days since, was in her company, also clad in blank armour.\"* There is another original document de scribing the maid's appearance at this time : a letter from a young officer, Guy, Sire de Laval, to his mother and grandmother at home. It begins in an old-fashioned form \u2014 \"My very redoubtable ladies and mothers;\" and, after some detads of his journey, pro ceeds to the following effect: \u2014 \"On the Sunday, then, I set out with the king to go to Selles, in Berry, four leagues from St. A*guan ; and the king caused the Maid, who before this was at Selles, to come forth and meet him The aforesaid Maid appeared fully armed on all points, save only her head, and held her lance in her hand, and she gave a hearty welcome to my brother and me. After we had dismounted at SeUes, 1 went to her dwelling to see her, upon which she ordered wine to be brought in, and told me that right soon she would have me to drink wine at Paris. Both in seeing and in hearing, she seems altogether a being from heaven. This same Monday, about the time of vespers, she set out again Charles, however, either from lingering distrust in the powers of the Maid, or from his habitual indolence, did not at once yield to her entreaties. It was considered neces sary, in the first instance, to reduce the other strongholds which the English still held upon the Loire. Jargeau, into which the earl of Suffolk himself had retired, was taken by assault, and the greater part of the garrison put to the sword, in spite of Joan's earnest entreaties that their lives should be spared. The garrisons of Beaugency and Mehun, intimidated by the fate of Jargeau, surrendered without resistance; and Talbot, on whom the chief command had now devolved, retreated with all speed towards the Seine. Tbe French army was strengthened at this juncture by the accession of a body of troops under Arthur de Richemont, the con stable of France. His coming was forbidden by the king, and was vehemently opposed by the faction of La Tremouille, who dreaded * Collection des Memoires, vol. viii p 225."], [412, "374 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. [a.d. 1429. a revival of his ascendancy. The first im pulse of Joan was to treat the disgraced noble as a rebel, and she proposed to punish his disobedience to the royal will by an appeal to arms ; but the other generals, who justly appreciated the skill and valour of their ancient comrade, and who earnestly desired union with him, persuaded her to mediate with the king. The words of Riche mont on his first interview with the female warrior are remarkable, as evincing both his plainness of speech and also the impression which, in common with others of his own station, he had received of the extraordinary person whom he was addressing. \"Joan,\" said this rough soldier, little seeking to disguise his mistrust, \" I am informed that you have been wishing to fight with me. I know not whether you are sent from God ; but if you are so, I fear you not at all, for God knows my thoughts. If, on the other hand, you are sent from the devil, I fear you still less.\" This freedom of speech, however, by no means prevented amicable intercourse and cordial co-operation against the enemy. The combined force overtook the English army near Patay, on the 18 th of June. So awe-struck were they at the thought of the supernatural powTer arrayed against them, that they gave way at once. Even the brave Fastolfe fled at the first fire; the Lords Talbot and Scales were taken prisoners, and two thousand two hundred of the vanquished were slain. This was the first pitched battle which had been gained by the French during eight years. La Tremouille, having succeeded in pre venting the constable from accompanying the king, no longer objected to the request, urged on aU hands, that he would make an attempt on Rheims in order to celebrate his coronation. Charles accordingly crossed the Loire at the head of twelve thousand men. without resistance. On the following day the coronation was performed with the cus- tomary rights, and such pomp as the hasti- ness of preparation allowed. The Maid of Orleans stood with her banner near the altar, and when the ceremony was ended she knelt to the king ; and having declared that her ministry was at an end, and that her pur poses were fully accomplished, she solicited permission \" to return to her father and mother, that she might tend their flocks and cattle, and fulfil her accustomed duties.\" Even if this wish were really expressed (concerning which there appears to be some doubt), it was not likely that it should be gratified by those to whom her services had hitherto proved so valuable, and who thought to derive from them still further advantage. But granting that the words were spoken, the Maid of Orleans was not less true a prophetess in announcing the close of her mission, than she had proved at first in declaring its triumphant progress ; and her decline after the ceremony at Rheims is per- haps more wonderful than her earlier glory. It seemed as if her former enthusiasm were extinct, and that she ceased to conquer from the moment at which she believed that she fought with only an arm of flesh. As Charles moved onward upon Paris, the duke of Bedford made a demonstration to intercept his march. The two armies confronted each other at Sends, but parted without an engagement. The king advanced to St. Denis, and in an assault on the Porte St. Honore, Joan wTas severely wounded and repulsed. It was her first unsuccessful enterprise, and it was believed to have been prognosticated to her a few days before its occurrence by the breaking of the conse crated sword which had been the companion of her victories. But fable has perhaps more closely enveloped her during her reverse than in her season of exaltation ; and the omens which fancy invented or accommodated to her fall are almost with- out end. The neutrality of Auxerre was respected ; Troyes made some show of resistance, but in the end capitulated ; Chalons followed its example ; and on the evening of the eighteenth day's march, Rheims itself, the great object of the expedition, was entered Charles, to whose tastes the perils and fatigues of the camp were little adapted,"], [413, "a.d. 1429.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 375 was easily persuaded by La Tremouille to return to the indolence of Chin on, and disgust and coldness were naturally excited by his abandonment of his partizans. The duke of Burgundy, who had been wavering, listened to the entreaties of a sister wdiose hand he had bestowed upon Bedford ; and perceiving how small reliance was to be placed tipon the stability of the king, accepted the Regency which his brother-in law offered to resign in his favour, and took possession of Paris. The duke of Bedford \u2014 after an interview in which many strong protestations of friendship were inter changed, and the concertment of a junction in the fodowing campaign \u2014 passed into Normandy, the government of which pro vince he had reserved to himself. drove back the assailants. In the retreat the Maid herself maintained the post of honour, and was the last of the rear-guard. With her usual intrepidity, she repeatedly faced about and checked the pursuers. Her friends, however, more eager to save themselves than to rescue her, pressed hur riedly through the half-closed town-gate, leaving Joan surrounded by enemies. An archer from Picardy coming up from behind, seized her by her coat of crimson velvet, and pulled her from her horse. She strug gled to rise again, and had reached the outer fosse, when she was overpowered and taken prisoner by Lionel, a bastard of Vendome, and a soldier in the company of John of Luxemburg. Strong suspicions were entertained at the time that the French officers, and especially Guillaume de Flavy, the governor of Com piegne, had, from envy of her renown, knowingly and willingly exposed the Maid to danger. He was a brave soldier, but notoriously harsh and cruel, and was afterwards murdered by bis own wife, who, on her trial, pleaded and proved that Flavy had resolved to betray Joan to the enemy; and the validity of her defence, strange to say, was admitted by the judges. \" The Maiden \" kept the field during part of the winter, and in the spring she was early in arms ; but she was no longer supported either by conviction of her own invincibility, or by a well-disciplined army which might assist in giving that conviction effect. Her last success, not earned with- out very considerable difficulty, was gained near Lacquy. The French king, disgusted with the fatigues and hardships of war, had returned to his old habits of self-indulgence and pleasure ; and so far from taking the command of his army in person, he did not even send to it one of the princes of the blood, or of the great lords of his court. Joan therefore found herself associated only with brutal adventurers, ill provided either with money or with stores of war, and un- willing to submit to any discipline.* Not many days afterwards, she threw herself into the fortress of Compiegne, which was at that time besieged by the duke of Bur- gundy at the head of a powerful army. On the evening of her arrival (24th May), she headed the garrison in a sally on the side of the bridge across the Oise. She sur prised one of the positions of the enemy, and inflicted on them a considerable loss. But the whole Burgundian host hastened to the spot, and after a fierce struggle The news of Joan's captivity excited great joy among the English and the Bur gundians, and \" Te Deum \" was celebrated at Paris by order of the duke of Bedford, in token of general thanksgiving. The Maid, who had been sold by her captor to John of Luxemburg, was claimed by Friar Martin, vicar-general of the grand inquisitor of France, in order that she might be tried by the \" Holy Inquisition \" for the crimes of heresy and witchcraft. But John of Lux emburg, without heeding Friar Martin's demand, sent Joan to his strong castle in Picardy, where she was treated with human ity, though closely guarded. The claim of the inquisitor was enforced by the uni versity of Paris and Pierre Cauchon (in whose diocese it was alleged she had been taken), bishop of Beauvais, who was a zeal ous partizan of the English.

The revelation which she had avowed was declared to be false, and proceeding from evil spirits and devils ; her visions were improbable, lying, and presumptuous ; her adoption of male attire was a transgression of the divine law and of canonical ordinances ; she was superstitious, a sorceress of the devil, a blasphemer of God and of his saints, a schismatic, and guilty of many errors against the faith of Jesus Christ.* Under these circumstances she was charitably admon ished to retract, with assurances that if she persevered she would expose her body to death and her soul to eternal torment. having been transferred in succession to the prisons of Beaurevoir, Arras, and Le Crotoy, at the mouth of the Somme, was ultimately, after four months' captivity, sold to the bishop by John of Luxemburg, for the sum of ten thousand livres. The demand was made in the name of Henry VI. as king of France, one part of whose pre rogative was the power of transferring to his own custody any enemy of the crown who might happen to be in the power of one of his subjects, on the payment of ten thousand livres. After two ineffectual attempts to escape she was delivered to the English, and committed, under close guard, to a dungeon at Rouen. A process was commenced against her for sorcery, and the most unworthy artifices were employed to procure her conviction. A priest of the name of Nicolas l'Oiseleur was introduced to her cell, as a fellow-prisoner suffer ing in the cause of Charles VII.; and it was hoped that when he had gained her confidence the false traitor might entangle her by betraying the secrets of confession. But the base stratagem was unsuccessful. Joan, indeed, had not a thought which she wished to conceal. When asked if she believed herself to be in a state of grace ? she replied that it was a difficult question ; adding, after a short pause, \" If I am not so, may God vouchsafe to admit me ; if I am so, may he preserve me in it.\" Either terror or importunity prevailed, and she at length consented to affix her mark (she could neither read nor write) to an abjuration which admitted that her com munications with saints and angels were altogether illusive. She was then led out to the burial-ground of Saint Oilers, wdiich had been dressed with scaffoldings for the purpose, and in which she listened to a sermon, to the recapitulation of her offences, and to her final sentence. \" We have con demned you,\" pronounced the bishop of Beauvais, \" to perpetual seclusion, in which, nourished by the bread of grief and by the water of bitterness, you may weep over your sins, and forbear from repeating them.\" The enemies of Joan had never intended that her life should be spared ; they merely hoped, by a pretended lenity, to palliate the guilt of her murder, or more effectually to blacken her memory. Of the subsequent occurrences in her prison it is manifestly impossible that any but those admitted within its walls can speak with accuracy; but horrible tales were whispered ofthe fraud and violence employed to procure her desired relapse. In a few days it was announced that she had resumed her former dress, that she pretended to have been visited afresh by St. Catherine and by St. Margaret, who had blamed During fifteen days of close and subtle interrogation before the bishop of Beauvais, Lemaitre, the vicar ofthe grand inquisitor, and nearly one hundred other lawyers or divines, though every artifice was employed to entrap, every threat to overawe her, not one answer was obtained from this simple and unlettered peasant girl which could tend to her crimination.

Her ashes were carefully gathered and thrown into the Seine, in order to prevent their appli cation to superstitious purposes. \" Such was the end of Joan of Arc \u2014 in her death the martyr, as in her life the champion, of her country.\" On Wednesday, May 15, she was carried at nine in the morning, arrayed in her female attire, to the old market-place of Rouen. The bishop of Beauvais declared that she was rejected from the church, and in delivering her to civil jurisdiction urged the customary exhortation, that she should be treated with gentleness and humanity as regarded both life and limb. The bailli of the city under stood this advice in the sense which it was intended to bear, and avoided excommuni cation by leading her instantly to the stake. At the market-place she found the wood ready piled, and the cardinal of Winchester, with the bishop of Beauvais and a number of priests and officers, awaiting her arrival. At the sight of the stake she shuddered and wept, but by degrees regained her self possession. A short sermon was delivered by a monk, who reproached Joan with her backsliding, and ended with these words \u2014 \" Go in peace, the church can no longer defend thee.\" The ill-fated Maid then knelt down and prayed aloud fervidly. She asked for a cross, but there was none at hand, and a messenger was sent to bring one from a neighbouring church. Mean whde an English soldier, breaking his staff asunder, formed a cross, which Joan de voutly clasped to her heart. But the other soldiers murmured at this delay; and one more brutal than his fellows exclaimed to the confessor who was administering the last consolations to the unhappy woman \u2014 \" How now, priest, do you mean to make us dine here?\" Their fierce impatience was at length gratified. Clothed in the infernal dress of the Inquisition, Joan was bound to the stake, and on her head was fixed a black cap with the inscription, \" Heretic, Relapsed Apostate, Idolator.\" The flames were lighted almost before the confessor could withdraw, and the sufferer, as the Of the part borne by the English in this most piteous tragedy we are far from seeking to offer any palliation. It is deeply and indelibly disgraceful. But it may be urged, not to extenuate but to account for their vindictiveness, that they were freshly smart ing under very severe losses ; and that they, doubtless, believed that which they had been sedulously taught, that Jeanne was an agent of hell. It may not be advisable to inquire further in what proportion they considered themselves to be avenging God's injuries in their own. But it should not be forgotten that the worst wrongs of the heroic maiden were inflicted by the hands of her own countrymen. Her most inveter ate enemy, the bishop of Beauvais, was a Frenchman ; so was his colleague, the vicar general ofthe Inquisition; so were both the cruel Canon Estivet, the public advocate, and the perfidious l'Oiseleur \u2014 the judges, the accuser, and the spy.* But above all, where is to be found a plea in behalf of the ungrateful and unfeeling prince whom Joan had saved from ruin ? who, if he suspected that her powers were more than natural, must have attributed them to heavenly agency; and who, having profited by them to the utmost, neglected, abandoned, and forgot her.t Not a trace exists of any negotiation in her favour, of any offer of ransom, of any menace of reprisal. So great was the poverty to which her family was reduced, that twenty years after her death the bur gesses of Orleans allowed the mother of the heroine who had delivered them three livres per month \" to support life,\" to keep body * Joan of Arc, by Earl Stanhope, p. 48. f Sismondi, vol. xiii. p. 194. 44"], [416, "378 HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

It was at length determined that a general congress should be convened at Arras, in which two car- dinal legates should preside ; each of the belligerents should be represented by his ambassadors ; and the leading European powers should be invited to participate. It was premised that honourable offers of peace should be tendered by Charles, with an understanding that if they were declined by Henry, the duke of Burgundy would abandon his alliance. The opening of these states-general of Christendom (to adopt the expressive language of Sismondi)* took place in the abbey of St. Vaast, on the 5th of August, 1435, and never perhaps was gathered together a more gorgeous assembly of diplomatists. The train of the English embassy consisted of two hundred knights ; nearly five hundred horsemen accompanied that of France ; the duke of Burgundy was escorted by his own archers clad in rich uniform; deputies attended from the uni- versity of Paris, from many other of the chief cities in the kingdom, and from the provinces of Flanders ; the emperor and the kings of Castile, Arragon, Portugal, Navarre, Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Poland, and Denmark, sent accredited envoys ; throngs of civilians and of canonists were prepared for the resolution of disputed questions ; noble ladies added their attraction to the brilliant scene ; and when the gay com pany rode abroad they were preceded \" by trumpets and clarions sounding most melo diously, and by numerous kings-at-arms, heralds, and pursuivants, dressed in their tabards, with the armorial blazonings of the different princes who had met at Arras.\"f In order to diminish the unfavourable excitement which had been produced by the coronation of Charles, the duke of Bed ford resolved to celebrate that of Henry also; and as Rheims was not to be ap proached, Paris was fixed upon as the theatre. The young king accordingly was escorted from Rouen (in which city he had held his court for nearly two years) by a powerful body-guard ; and after a recep tion attended with much pageantry, in his French capital, he was crowned in N6tre Dame by his uncle, the cardinal of Win chester. Much offence was taken by the bishop of Paris at this invasion of his ancient privdege; and the studious observ ance of English ceremonies with which the solemn rite was performed, tended far more to increase the growing disaffection than to conciliate the attachment of the conquered people. The death of the duchess of Bedford, and the re-marriage within a few months of the duke to Jacquetta of Luxemburg, without the approbation or even the privity of his brother-in-law, naturally weakened the pri vate bond which hitherto had cemented their friendship. Burgundy could not but perceive that the gratification of revenge for his father's murder had placed him in a false position towards his own countrymen; and that, however much the heat of the civil conflict for awhile might have dis guised the truth, the part which he had taken was esteemed unnatural by many of the leading nobles, and began to displease even his immediate partizans. The debates were conducted with much heat; and the cardinal of Winchester, who was chief English representative, perceived from the outset that the duke of Burgundy was lost as an ally. The basis upon which the English wished to negotiate was the treaty of Troyes; in other words, the sur render of the whole kingdom by Charles to It would be tedious to recount the numer ous petty enterprises and isolated military operations during the following year, which occasioned misery to France without ad vancing the interests of either of the great contending parties. All parties were ex hausted, and all equally desired peace, though they were far from being prepared * Vol. xiii. p. 431. f Monstrelet, vol. vii c. 80, 81."], [417, "A.d. 1443.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 379 Henry.

The duke of York, father to Edward I V, was appointed to succeed him as regent ; but the defection of Bur gundy clouded all the prospects which were entertained as arising from his popular qualities. The English were still in pos session of many fine provinces, and had garrisons in some of the principal towns; and yet it no longer remained doubtful that \u2014 so soon as Charles could command the resources of his extensive dominions \u2014 the invaders would be compelled to relinquish every part of their conquests which did not communicate directly with the sea.* The departure ofthe English ambassadors was the signal for reconediation between Charles and the duke of Burgundy, and the concessions to which the former submitted attest the high value at which he rated his purchase. In the outset, the king declared the assassination at Montereau to have been wicked, traitorous, and iniquitous, but that it had been perpetrated at a time at which he was very young, had little knowledge, and inconsiderately did not prevent it. He undertook to punish all those who should be convicted of privity to the murder, and to found and to endow certain religious edifices for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. After the grant of numerous payments, immunities, and territorial aug mentations, the king relieved his vassal, during the life of both the contracting parties, from all personal homage ; and a general amnesty was proclaimed for injuries committed on either side, with a special exception relating to the death of Sans Peur. The signature of this treaty was hailed with unbounded joy ; the legates administered the Eucharist to the principal negotiators, and absolved the chief Bur gundian lords from their oath of alliance with the English. \" Here am I,\" bluntly exclaimed one of them, De Lannoy, when he knelt to swear allegiance to Charles, \"who have heretofore taken oaths for the preservation of peace five times during this war, not one of which has been observed. But I now make promise to God that this shall be kept on my part, and that I will not in any way infringe it.\"* The news of the duke of Burgundy's secession caused great indignation in Eng land, and the messengers whom he sent to announce the step he had taken were ill received by the court. The cardinal of Winchester, the duke of Gloucester, and several others, left the council \" abruptly, much confused and vexed, and having col lected in small knots they abused each other as well as the duke of Burgundy; and no one who was well bred was sparing of the grossest abuse against the duke of Bur gundy and his country.\"! It required, indeed, little sagacity to perceive that he could not long continue neutral, and that the transition would be rapid from sus pended friendship to open enmity. By the following spring the duke of Burgundy announced to his vassals at Ghent that he was under the necessity of declaring war against England. Within little more than a month from that declaration his troops assisted the constable LTsle - Adam and Dunois in the recovery of Paris, from which city, its governor, Lord Willoughby, was compelled to withdraw to Rouen.

Bolingbroke, the duke's chaplain, was condemned as an accomplice of the duchess, and drawn and quartered at Tyburn ; and Margery Jourdayn, a reputed witch, on the same pretence was burnt in Smithfield. The duke himself was after wards arrested and committed to prison (February, 1447), where he was found dead in his bed, not without suspicion that his uncle, the prelate, as well as the duke of Suffolk, and perhaps the queen herself, were privy to his murder. indeed, seemed as though he were careless of his remaining possessions in France, and the predominant faction in his councils were strongly inclined to peace, at whatever price it might be purchased. William de la Pole, a favourite, whom Henry afterwards created marquis and then duke of Suffolk, was in structed to negotiate on almost any terms, and a prospective free pardon was granted him by the king for every condition to which he might assent, even if it were dis advantageous to the crown. Suffolk accord ingly agreed to a truce for twenty-two months, and further arranged a matrimonial alliance for the king, now in his 24th year, to which much future disaster must be attributed. Rene of Anjou, the father of the new queen, notwithstanding the many dignities appended to his name, was perhaps the poorest of the French princes ; and this titular king of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusa lem, count of Provence, duke of Anjou, Lorraine, and Bar, and brother of the queen regent of France, was unable to give a portion with his daughter Margaret. Yet more, when he consented to bestow her hand on the king of England, it was under a condition, which Suffolk concealed at the time, that the provinces of Anjou and Maine should be transferred to him. \u2022 The conflict of parties, which the king could neither direct nor overawe, so much distracted the affairs of his government that no adequate effort was made to check the progress of the French arms. Charles had industriously availed himself of the truce subsisting between the two countries, which, though short, enabled him to assemble his forces, to repair his fortifications, and to supply his castles with ammunition and stores. The activity of Dunois, too, and his great ability as a general, gave so powerful an efficacy to the plans of his sovereign, that in a brief space of time the English were compelled to withdraw from the various districts of France, some of which they had possessed nearly three centuries.* Margaret was handsome and high-spirited, and noted for her ability and decision of character; but her pride, vindictiveness, and love of arbitrary power contributed not a little to bring heavy calamities both on the royal family and on the country. The duke of Gloucester was desirous that the choice should have fallen on a lady of the house of Armagnac; but not having influ ence to realize his wishes, he soon felt himself oppressed by the greater power of his rival, who derived considerable accession of strength from the talents and ambition of the young queen. His duchess was suddenly arrested and accused of treason, \"for that she by sorcery and enchantment intended to destroy the king to the intent to advance and to promote her husband to the crown.\" She was condemned to do public penance An ineffectual attempt was made to nego tiate peace with England, in a conference held at Gravelines between the duchess of Burgundy, on the one side, and the cardinal of Winchester, on the other. Although the English fought with indomitable courage and gained various successes, yet Charles, while carefully evading battle with the enemy, succeeded in capturing Pontoise, in spite of the most resolute struggle of Clifford for its defence, and of Talbot for its relief. After successive prolongations of the truce with England, hostilities were renewed in the spring of 1448 ; but in the crowd of events which mark the war, we look in vain * Monstrelet, vol iii. p 21.

When the bastard of Orleans invaded Normandy, the decline of the English fortune was most rapid. Rouen opened its gates to the king in person ; and on the surrender of its castle a few days afterwards, by the duke of Somerset, the veteran Talbot became a host age,* among other knights, for the fulfilment of the capitulation. Harfleur was added to the French conquests before the close of this year, and in the ensuing campaign an English force under Sir Thomas Kyriel left four thousand dead, after a most valiant resistance, at Fourmigny. The English were defeated by the arrival of an entirely fresh force under the Constable Richemont, after they had beaten back the count de Clermont, and had captured from him two culverins. \" From the account of the heralds, priests, and credible persons, three thousand seven hundred and seventy-three were slain, and buried in fourteen deep trenches on the spot.\"f The conquest of Normandy was completed by the subsequent fads of Caen, Falaise, and Cherbourg; and the increasing domestic troubles of England rendered Guienne a yet more easy prey to Dunois in the year following. Even Bor deaux, so important to commercial interests, was suffered to capitulate without an effort in her defence. \" Thus,\" as the old chroni cler says, \" by the grace of God was the whole of Guienne and Normandy reduced to* the obedience of the king of France, and all the possessions the English had in that realm, excepting the town of Calais, which still remains in their hands. But God grant that it may soon share a similar fate ! and thus will the saying be accomplished, ' Obedience is better than sacrifice.' \"J restoration of tbe legitimate branch of the royal family. He was the son of Anne Mortimer, who was descended from Philippa, the only daughter of the duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III. ; and, conse quently, he stood in the order of succession before the king actually on tbe throne, who was sprung from John of Gaunt, a younger son of the monarch just named. Richard had many partizane among the nobles, who were not less disgusted with the imbecility which disgraced the crown, than with the proceedings of the faction who surrounded the queen and dictated the chief measures of government. As Suffolk was understood to be his principal adviser, the enmity which that nobleman's great power had long before excited now sought its gratification by impeaching him of treason. But his accus ers did not succeed in carrying conviction to the minds of his judges, with regard to the capital offence which they imputed to him. Nevertheless, as he pleaded guilty to certain misdemeanors, he was banished by Henry beyond the seas. But the vessel in which he embarked was brought to between Dover and Calais by a man-of-war, on board of which he was carried, and after three days executed as a traitor. This occurrence was traced by popular suspicion to the intrigues of the duke of York, who in the meanwhile was employed as governor of Ireland, at a convenient distance from home. The same feeling was still further increased by the insur rection of Jack Cade, a native of that country, who, assuming the name of John Mortimer, stood forth as the avenger of public rights, and drew around him not fewer than twenty thousand men. A small force sent against him under the command of an experienced officer was defeated at Sevenoaks ; upon which the conqueror advanced to Blackheath and took possession of London. The citizens, who at first received Cade very favourably, were soon offended by the repeated acts of violence committed by his followers, and at length took arms in order to check their ravages The weakness of the king, whose under standing displayed no tokens of ever arriving at manly vigour, secretly encouraged the hopes of Richard, duke of York, that the nation would soon be ready to assent to the * Monstrelet. vol. ix c. 13. t Ibid., vol. ix. c. 18.

A repulse, sustained by the insurgents, destroyed their confidence in a leader whose power was never exercised except to do mischief; and a price being set upon his head, he was put to death by a gentleman of Sussex, who had suffered from his violence. Such events, of no great importance in themselves, rose to consider able magnitude when viewed through the medium of their supposed connection with the schemes ofthe house of York.* the reins of government could no longer be left in his hands without providing him with suitable aid and advice. The duke of York was named by Parliament lord pro tector of the realm, being thereby invested with only a certain pre-eminence in the council, as well, perhaps, as with the command of the army in case of disturbance or invasion ; but still holding his office at the pleasure of the king, who could at any time annul the appointment and resume the full exercise of his prerogative.* The country at large, however, began to partake the sentiments of the malcontents with respect to the weakness and injustice ofthe government as directed by the queen's friends. The Parliament, which met in November, was loud in its complaints of abuses, and prolific in expedients for re medying the evils which seemed to oppress the nation. It was moved by one of the members, that as the king had no children, the duke of York should be declared heir apparent \u2014 a motion which was not strongly supported, and was allowed to drop. But Richard, who had returned from Ireland, resolved to appeal to the sword, so soon as his adherents were prepared to bring his claims to that form of arbitration ; and, repairing to the borders of Wales, he called around him the retainers of his family on the estates of Mortimer, who flocked to his standard with great alacrity. With his mouth full of the most loyal protestations he advanced towards London, expecting a cordial reception from the inhabitants ; but disappointed of support in that quarter, he listened to terms, and finally made his peace with Henry ,f Richard, however, was not disposed to resign the authority with which he was thus clothed, but either doubting the recovery of his master, or fearing the craft of his antagonist the duke of Somerset, he answered the summons to resign by appearing in the field at the head of an army. Roused by this intelligence, Henry, whose health had unquestionably improved, left London with such troops as were at hand, and advanced to St. Alban's, where, to his amazement, he beheld the banners of the Yorkists displayed as a token of their resolution to dispute his progress. A conflict ensued \u2014 the forerunner of many a bloody struggle \u2014 in which he was taken prisoner, after being slightly wounded in the neck, and suffering the loss of his noble friends, Somerset, Northumberland, and Clifford, who fell in his defence. The victor affected sorrow for the blood which had been shed, and renewed in the most glowing terms the assurances of his fealty and attachment to his sovereign, who, on his part, was either convinced that Richard had his interests at heart, or sound it convenient to appear satisfied with his professions of duty. The duke was recalled to the head of the council as protector; accepting the office, this second time, on condition that it should not, as before, be \" revocable at the single will of the king, but by the king in Parliament, with the advice and assent of the lords spiritual and temporal.\" It was, however, provided, that the protectorate, if still necessary, should be conferred on the The royal cause received some support from the success which at first accompanied the attempt of Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, to recover Guienne for the English crown, as well as from the birth of a prince of Wales, which took place in the autumn of this year.

The duke of York now openly advanced his title as the true heir to the crown, and urged Parliament to confer it upon him without delay. No doubt could be enter tained as to the abstract right ; but as the Lancastrian branch of the royal family had enjoyed the throne for three generations, and as Henry had done nothing to justify a forfeiture, it was at length resolved that the latter should continue to possess the sovereign power during his natural life, and that Richard should succeed to it at his death. But this compromise, though agreed to by both parties, did not give entire satisfaction to either. The queen, indignant at the injury inflicted on her son, engaged the nobles who had hitherto supported her husband to take up arms on behalf of his child. The earl of Northumberland, accord ingly, with the Lords Dacre, Clifford, and Nevil, assembled an army at York, and were soon joined by the duke of Somerset and the earl of Devon. The hostile bodies met at Wakefield, where, after a bloody encoun ter, Richard was slain, Salisbury was taken and instantly beheaded, and the young Lord Rutland was stabbed to the heart by the vindictive Clifford, who overtook him in the retreat t (30th December, 1460). As might have been expected, however, the reconciliation between the two parties, which the king and Richard represented was neither cordial nor lasting. No sooner did the former recover some degree of mental vigour than he spurned the ascend ancy claimed by the duke and insisted on his retirement; while the latter, pene trating the motives of those who acted in the shades of the court, and who aimed at the accomplishment of their objects by stimulating the jealousy of the monarch, resolved to secure for his adherents a continuance in the advantageous position which they then occupied. Several years had passed in mutual recrimination, and in those secret intrigues which usually precede the explosions of civil war. At length, in the month of September, 1459, a hostile collision took place on Bloreheath, in Staffordshire, in which the royalists were defeated with considerable loss ; but when the king in person, appearing at the head of sixty thousand men, professed his readi ness to listen to the complaints of the insurgents, and to accede to their just demands, the spirit of loyalty revived among their ranks, their affection for the gentle Henry returned, and many of them passed over to his standard.! Edward, earl of March, now succeeded to the claims of his father, and to the command of the troops which fought for the house of York ; and from this epoch, it has been remarked that the war assumed a new character and displayed a ferocious spirit hitherto unknown during the progress of this unhappy strife. Hearing of the loss at Wakefield, Edward hurried from Gloucester with such force as he could raise, with the view of interposing a barrier between the victors and the city of London. His march was closely pursued by a body of royalists, who followed the standard of the earl of Pembroke and Sir Owen Tudor. Edward dreading that he might have to combat two The first fruits of this bloodless victory appeared in a resolution to charge with treason the principal leaders of the opposite fiction. In a Parliament convened at Coventry, an act of attainder was passed against the duke of York and his wife, their chddren, the earls of March and Rutland, the earl of Salisbury and his son, Lord Warwick, the famous \"king-maker.\" Such severities, little suited to the inclination of the peaceful sovereign, drove the Yorkists to the re-adoption of violent measures. They once more led an army into the field, defeated the royal troops at Northampton, made the king again prisoner, and compelled the queen * Wyrcest, p. 481. Whetham. p. 479. t Rot.

This success was not a little tarnished by the cruelties which followed ; for still burning with resentment for the murder of his brother and the execution of some of his dearest friends in Yorkshire, he commanded that Sir Owen, the husband of Queen Cathe rine, and seven other commanders who had fallen into his hands, should be decapitated at Hereford f (1st February, 1461). recourse to plunder and rapine. Edward, who was not disheartened by the repulse inflicted on his general, Lord Warwick, pushed forward to attack the royalists, or to scatter them by tbe terror of his approach. Henry, to whom the shedding of blood, whether in the field or on the scaffold, never failed to occasion the most poignant distress, resolved to fall back into the northern counties, and to wait the issue of events at a distance from the seat of govern- ment. The young duke of York did not pursue him. Aware that the contest could not be decided in the remote parts of the kingdom, where hostilities might be pro- tracted year after year without any material advantage on either side, he determined to enter the city, now become friendly to his interests, and to solicit the crown which belonged to his lineage. This bold measure succeeded. The people of London, struck with his martial appearance, so superior to the pusillanimous manner and feminine aspect of the king, listened with attention to the address which was made on his behalf, and signified their concur- rence with the loudest acclamations. In a great council which was held on the following day (March 2), it was resolved that, by joining the army, Henry had vio- lated the conditions stipulated by Parlia- ment, and had forfeited the crown to the son of Richard, late duke of York. Two days later Edward rode in procession to Westminster Hall, where, ascending the throne, he explained to a numerous audi- ence the rights of his family to the sceptre of Henry III. His speech was frequently interrupted by shouts of \" Long live King Edward !\" and he was immediately pro claimed by the heralds in the usual style throughout the whole city.* In this manner terminated the reign of Henry VI., who, at his accession, was acknowledged king of France and England, but who wanted talents and ambition to realize his brilliant prospects. Meantime Margaret, with the army under the command of Northumberland, was pro ceeding by hasty marches towards the capital. The earl of Warwick had taken post at St. Alban's, the scene of a former conflict between the same parties, and had succeeded in driving back the advanced guard of the royalists, who had penetrated to the centre of the town. Next day (Feb ruary 17), however, the battle was renewed in circumstances more favourable to the Lan castrians, who not only recovered the loss which they sustained in their attempt to force a passage through the streets, but completely worsted their opponents and compelled them to have recourse to an ignominious flight. Henry and his queen met once more, and through her influence the weak and facile monarch was easily induced to declare that the late award to which he had assented was forced upon him, and that he no longer held himself bound by the hard conditions dic tated by the duke of York. He concluded by issuing orders for the apprehension of Edward, whom he described in his proclama tion as the \" late earl of March,\" and whose succession, even to the title possessed by his father, he determined not to recognize. t. But the king wanted energy to act upon his own decisions. instead of entering London with the conquerors of Wakefield and St. Alban's, he allowed them to remain idle in the vicinity ; and the troops, who were not supplied with a regular allowance of food, provoked the inhabitants by having * Wyrcest, p. 486. t Rot.

The different fortunes which attended the two sovereigns who, at this period, laid claim to the English crown, may be traced with some degree of certainty to the difference in their characters. The son of the hero of Agincourt was inactive, mild, and humane, a stranger to all the stronger passions which were driven back in confusion. The earl, dreading the effects of a repulse in presence of an army ready to engage, rode up to Ed ward, and shooting his own horse through tbe head, as a signal that there was to be no retreat from the field into which they were about to enter, called aloud, \" Sire, God have mercy on the souls of those who for love of you have sacrificed their lives in this enterprise. Yet let him flee who is disposed to flee ; but by this cross,\" and as he spoke he kissed the hilt of his sword, \" I will stand by him who will stand by me ! \" A pro clamation was accordingly issued, giving to every one full liberty to retire ; but threat ening the severest punishment to those who should show the smallest symptoms of cow ardice in the approaching battle. influence the affairs of mankind and agi- tate the councils of nations ; Edward, on the other hand, was bold, indefatigable, and enterprising. Devoted to pleasure, he yet did not sacrifice to its indulgence tbe higher duties of a king or of a commander ; and, though not quite twenty years of age, he withdrew from the applause of the capital, in order to finish the war by dispersing or defeating the army which stdl adhered to the cause of his rival. Margaret, whose name had little weight in Kent and Essex, had deemed it the wiser course to retire into the north, where her friends were still numerous, rather than to remain in the neighbourhood of London, where the marauding disposition of her followers had created much disgust and enmity. Edward resolved to bring her troops to battle before the country at large could shake off the impression produced by his last successes ; and with this view he despatched Lord Fitzwaiter to seize the passage over the Aire, at Ferrybridge, that the main body of his troops might advance without interruption. The value of this post gave rise to a severe skirmish, in which the Yorkists, after sustaining some loss, The 30th day of March, 1461, is remark able in the history of the civil war for the bloody contest which took place at Towton between the armies of York and Lancaster, amounting to forty thousand and sixty thousand respectively. The conflict had raged ten hours with unabated fury before either could be compelled to give ground. At length, when the earl of Northumber land and Lord Clifford, the principal leaders of Henry's troops, were slain, and twenty thousand private men were laid prostrate on the field, victory declared in favour of Edward.

The king and queen, upon learning the extent of their loss, made the best of their way across the borders, and sound a tem porary asylum at the court of James.* But though she obtained possession of the castles of Alnwick, Bamborough, and Dun stanburgh, on the approach of the earl of Warwick with twenty thousand men she was compelled to return on board ship and put to sea; when the winds, as if in alliance with the dominant party, dashed her small fleet upon the rocks near Holy Island, and reduced her to the necessity of again trust ing herself and son to the fidelity of her oppressed adherents (November, 1462). While wandering from place to place in search of safety or escape, she was plundered by a band of robbers, who stripped her of her money, jewels, and everything else that appeared valuable ; when, dreading still more frightful violence, she watched an opportunity, during their quarrel about the spoil, to dart with her boy into the depths ofthe forest which surrounded them. After wandering some time, spent with hunger and fatigue, she saw a man advancing with a drawn sword in his hand; and having too much reason to conclude that he was one of the same profession with the others, she formed the resolution of throwing herself upon his generosity. Approaching him, she said, \"Here, friend, I commit to your care the safety of your king's son;\" an address which instantly raised all the feelings of loyalty in his breast, and bound him to the interests of the royal youth. He conducted her to a place of security, whence she made her escape beyond seas.* Upon his return to London, Edward celebrated his coronation, which was per formed at Westminster in the month of June, 1461. In a Parliament which met in November, the judicial acts, creations of nobility, and most other public proceedings in the reigns of Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI., \"late, in fact but not of right, kings of England,\" were confirmed ; but with certain exceptions, the grants made by those sovereigns were revoked. Then followed an alarming display of legal re venge, in the form of a bill of attainder, directed against almost every distinguished person who had espoused the cause of the house of Lancaster ; all of whom were adjudged to suffer the penalties of treason, the loss of their honours, the forfeiture of their estates, and an ignominious death. This list included the defeated monarch, his queen, their son, together with twelve nobles, and about a hundred and forty knights, priests, and esquires.f Margaret, who was the last to despair of the fortunes of her family, made the great est exertions in France and Scotland to raise forces in order to meet her enemy in the field once more. Louis XL, who, in the preceding year had succeeded his father, Charles VII., bestowed on her twenty thou sand crowns, and Peter de Breze, seneschal of Normandy, raised two thousand men for her cause. But her endeavours, though at tended with some measure of success, were quite unavailing against the overwhelm ing numbers with which she had to contend. She landed on the coast of Northumberland, where she was joined by some of the Lancas trian exiles and a band of Scottish borderers. The Lancastrians, though frequently thwarted in their attempts to check the cur rent by which their affairs were depressed, did not yet relinquish hope. Collecting their scattered bands in the north of Eng land, where the root of their strength still kept hold of the soil, they resolved to make another appeal to the fortune of war, under the auspices of Somerset, Percy, and Sir Ralph Gray, who had deserted the Yorkist and joined the Lancastrian faction. But Montague, brother to the earl of Warwick, the warden of the Eastern Marches, who had watched their movements, attacked a * Habington, p. 432. Grafton, p. 656. Hall, sol. 187.

Henry, who was present at this action, escaped by the speed of his horse ; but some of his attendants were recognized by the peculiar livery with which they were decorated, and by the royal helmet which one of them bore. A cap of estate, gar nished with two rich crowns, was in a few days presented to Edward at York, as part of the spod torn from the person of his rival. The fugitive prince himself made his way to the borders, where the doubtful jurisdiction, and the wild life of the inhab itants, afforded great facilities for conceal ment. For about twelve months he eluded the search of his enemies and the vigilance ofthe government; nor was it until he was betrayed by a monk, who had succeeded in detecting his haunts, that he was appre hended by the retainers of Sir James Harrington, as he sat at meat in Wadding ton hall. After his capture he was sent to London, and thrown into the Tower by command of the king, who, though he freely spilled the blood of the Lancastrians without restraint or compunction, spared the life of his cousin, whose talents or am bition could never excite alarm. But he nevertheless gave his consent to the inflic tion of indignities upon the fallen monarch, which to minds of a certain temperament would have proved more terrible than death. At Islington he was met by the earl of Warwick, who, by proclamation, forbade every one to show him the smallest respect. His feet were then tied to the stirrups as those of a prisoner ofthe lowest order; and after being led thrice round the pillory, he was conducted to the Tower, in which he was doomed to linger several years.* Edward seemed now securely seated on the throne of England, and the destruction of his most powerful enemies, the capture of Henry, the flight of tbe queen, and the treaties he had concluded with Scotland, France, Burgundy, and other continental powers, seemed to guarantee the perma nence of his authority; but a sudden passion for a beautiful woman brought about his expulsion, for a time, from the throne and the kingdom. Happening one day to pay a visit to Jacqueta, formerly duchess of Bedford, now the wife of Sir Richard Woodville, he met with Elizabeth her daughter, the widow of Sir John Gray\u2014 one of the Lancastrian chiefs who had been slain in the second battle of St. Albans. The young widow, who was both beautiful and accomplished, threw herself at the feet ofthe sovereign, and implored him to reverse the attainder of Sir John, and to restore his forfeited estates to his helpless children. Edward was so favourably impressed by the beauty and the eloquent pleadings of the lady, that he not only granted her request, but contracted a private marriage with her, on the 1st of May, 1464. The union was kept secret for some months ; but at length, on the 29th of September, Edward summoned a great council of the prelates and lay lords to meet in the royal abbey of Reading, and Elizabeth was intro duced to the august assembly as queen, by the duke of Clarence and the earl of War wick, who must have concealed for a time the feelings of dissatisfaction with which they regarded the match. On the 26th of May following, the new queen was crowned at Westminster with unusual pomp. The powerful family of the Nevills, to whom Edward undoubtedly owed his crown, had up to this time monopolized the larger share of the honours and emoluments of the gov ernment. The earl of Warwick was the commander-in-chief both of the sea and land forces, and was besides warden of the AVest Marches, chamberlain, and governor of Calais.

A battle took place at Banbury between the northern boors and an army of Welsh under the earl of Pembroke, the result of which was partial defeat on both sides, and the execution of the two commanders by the hands of their respective enemies. This barbarous practice of putting to death such generals as were taken in the field was begun by Lord Mon tague, who ordered Robert Hulderne, the chief of the rebel forces, to undergo the punishment of a traitor ; and this miserable example was so far extended as to com prehend the earl of Pembroke himself, the earl of Devonshire, Sir Henry Nevill, and at length the earl of Rivers and his son, near relations of the king.* Hedgely Moor and Hexham, had received a gift of the forfeited estates of the Percys, and was made warden of the East Marches; whilst the youngest brother was created chancellor, and subsequently archbishop of York. But now titles and estates were showered with lavish profusion on the rela tions and connections of the new queen. Her father was created Earl of Rivers \"; her brother was made Lord Scales; her sisters were respectively married to the duke of Buckingham, the earl of Kent, and the earl of Huntingdon, young men who were raised to those dignities chiefly on account of their wives;* and the heiress of the duke of Exeter, whose hand Warwick had solicited for his own nephew, was contracted to Sir Thomas Gray, Elizabeth's son by her former husband. It is difficult to ascertain whether War wick was concerned in the various risings which took place about this period. A commotion excited by Sir Robert Wellis has been ascribed to his influence, and is even supposed to have formed part of his design for the expulsion of Edward from the throne. Edward, however, was so little suspicious of his former friend, that he employed him in raising forces for the support of the royal cause ; and it was not until the earl and the duke of Clarence were found encouraging the complaints of the people in the disaffected counties, that the king took such steps as compelled them to seek refuge in France. Louis XI. was not only ready to grant them an asylum, but also to avail himself of their resentment against the English throne, the strength of which he had long dreaded, more especially as connected with the pretensions inherited from Henry V. A meeting took place in June, 1470, in the chfiteau of Amboise, between the dethroned Queen Margaret and Prince Edward her son, on the one side, and their old enemy the earl of War wick and King Louis, on the other, when, in spite of their long-cherished enmity and mutual wrongs, they entered into a treaty against their common enemy. The Warwick, in order to strengthen his hands against this marked ascendancy go rapidly acquired by the queen's kindred, formed an alliance with the duke of Clar ence, brother of Edward, to whom he gave his eldest daughter in marriage. In this manner a foundation was laid for the exist ence of a faction hostile to the government, the members of which, although they might not entertain any views directly incompat ible with the stability of the throne, were constantly exposed to the influence of motives which, in a moment, might carry them beyond the bounds of their allegiance, and perhaps to actual rebellion. An incident accordingly soon occurred, which stirred the elements of disaffection into activity, and disturbed the kingdom. The occupiers of land in a certain district of Yorkshire, burdened with a tax on their produce for the support of an hospital, refused to pay it; and upon being pressed or threatened with the pains of law they flew to arms, having increased their num bers to about fifteen thousand. This in surrection, which was at first treated with contempt, gradually acquired importance, as well from the multitude who engaged in * Hall, sol. 193. Habington, p. 437. Holinshed, p. 667.

It was no less surprising,\" continues the chronicler, \"that he should delude the duke of Clar ence, brother to the king whom he opposed, who ought in reason to have dreaded and endeavoured to prevent the restoration of the house of Lancaster; but affairs of this nice nature are to be managed with great craft and artifice, and not without.\" Burgundy equipped a small fleet, he landed on the 16th of March at Ravenspur, in \"i orkshire. In the neighbourhood of Coven try he was joined by his brother, the duke of Clarence, who once more changed sides at the head of a powerful force. Advancing by rapid marches towards London, Edward met with a cordial reception from the citizens, to the greater part of whom the adminis tration of Warwick had not proved accept able. That noblemen, though now deserted by Clarence and other members of his own family, scorned to listen to the terms pro posed to him by the head of the house of York, and made immediate preparations to meet him in the field of battle. Edward, accordingly, whose late dangers had taught him the value of despatch, lost no time in forwarding his levies, and after a few days proceeded from the capital with an army, much more formidable, indeed, for its spirit than for its numbers. The hostile bodies met on the 14th of April at Barnet, where a decisive conflict took place, which ter minated to the complete advantage of the Yorkists.* \"Both sides sought on foot, and the king's vanguard suffered extremely in the action ; the earl's main battle advanced against his, and so near that the king himself was engaged in person and behaved himself as bravely as any officer in the army. The earl of Warwick's custom was never to fight on foot; but now at the importunity of his brother, tbe marquis of Montague (who was a person of great courage), he fought on soot, and sent away his horses. The conclusion of all was, that the earl, the marquis of Montague, and several other brave officers, were killed, for the slaughter was very great ; King Edward having resolved at his departure from Flanders to call out no more to spare the common soldiers and kill only the gentlemen, as he had formerly done ; for he had conceived a mortal hatred against the commons of England for having At this epoch the most important events succeeded each other with astonishing rapidity, without any such apparent con nection as enables the historian to establish among them the relation of cause and effect. Warwick landed in England (3rd September, 1470), and in eleven days made himself master of the country ; compelling Edward to flee for his life, replacing the imbecile Henry on a throne the obligations of which he knew not how to discharge, and reserving, of course, the real power in his own hands. The usual process of reversals and attainders followed this renewed accession ; every statute passed during the reign of the abdicated monarch was repealed ; he himself was declared a usurper ; and all his adherents, among whom was his younger brother Richard, duke of Gloucester, were denounced as traitors. Edward, meanwhile, had taken refuge in Holland, and had narrowly escaped being captured on his voyage by the Easter lings, who were then at war both with the English and French.

This battle was bravely fought, for on the king's side there were killed fifteen hundred men.* wick proved the ruin of the party of which he was the head and mainstay. Queen Margaret arrived from the Conti- nent with a detachment of French troops on the very day on which her new friends were defeated at Barnet. The intelligence struck her with dismay, and she seemed for a moment inclined to retire from a conflict which threatened to overwhelm the partizans of her husband under a heavier load of suffering than they had endured heretofore. But her natural spirit, aided by encourage- ment from the duke of Somerset, the earl of Pembroke, and other trusty leaders, induced her again to hazard her cause under the banners of Lancaster. Directing her course towards Wales, she attempted to pass the Severn at Gloucester, with the view of joining a powerful reinforcement which awaited her approach on the Marches ; and had not the bridge been fortified by the inhabitants, who took part with her enemies, she might have found means of protracting the war till her adherents in the north could have assembled their followers. Advancing to Tewkesbury, she learned that Edward, at the head of a superior army, had already taken up a position which could not be passed without risking an engage ment. The commanders, glowing with resentment and an eager desire for victory, drew out their lines, and met one another with the utmost fury. Fortune again smiled on Edward; the Lancastrians were defeated with great slaughter. The earl of Devon shire and Lord Wenlock were left dead on the ground; while the duke of Somerset and about twenty other persons of distinction were dragged from a church in Tewkesbury where they had taken refuge, and were in stantly beheaded. Margaret and her son were taken prisoners. The latter, when carried into the presence of Edward, was asked by him, how he had dared to enter the realm as an invader ? The youth re plied, that he had come to assert his father's right, and his own just inheritance. The king, giving way to ungovernable rage, brutally struck the prince on the face with The renowned \" King - maker,\" whose career terminated on the fatal field of Bar net, was undoubtedly the most powerful nobleman of his day in England. In addition to his extended connections and vast possessions, the \" stout earl \" greatly increased his influence by his eminent per sonal qualities \u2014 his courage and military renown ; his general talent, frankness, and affability ; and his boundless hospitality. He kept open house wherever he resided, and thirty thousand persons are said to have been entertained daily at his various mansions. \" When he came to London,\" says Stowe, \" he held such a house that six oxen were often eaten at a breakfast, and every tavern was full of his meat.\" The alliances, honours, and estates at this period of the Nevill family, of which the great earl, though not the chief, was the most illustrious member, have never been equalled by any English house. The head of the family was the earl of Westmoreland, lord of Raby. The three uncles of the earl of Warwick were barons \u2014 Fauconberg, Aber gavenny, and Latimer; one of his brothers was the marquis of Montague ; another was the archbishop of York ; his uncle, Richard duke of York, was the father of King Edward; while the Talbot's, Beauchamps, Percys, Scropes, and other great families, were connected with the house by marriage. A duke, a marquis, six earls, six barons, two queens, a princess of Wales, seven duchesses, a marchioness, fourteen count esses, twenty baronesses, two lord high chancellors, two archbishops of York, two bishops, besides ambassadors, speakers of the House of Commons, and other dignitaries, sprang from the grand old stem of the Nevills of Raby.f It need be no matter of suiprise that the fall of the earl of War- * Philippe de Comines. f Drummond's Illustrious Families of Great Britain."], [429, "a.d. 1471-1474.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 391 his gauntlet \u2014 an act of violence which was taken by the attendants as a signal for putting him to death.

The king of England, immedi ately after his disembarkation, despatched a herald to notify his presence, and to assert a formal claim to the crown of France. Notwithstanding the insulting tenor of his message, the envoy was received with marked courtesy, and not dismissed till his good-will had been gained by sumptuous presents. On his return he was instructed to represent that a war between England and France would be equally detrimental to the interests of both kingdoms, and that the duke of Burgundy and the constable of St. Pol had promised aid which they were unwilling and indeed unable to afford. The former, as was plain, was at that moment greatly perplexed by reverses which he had endured in Switzerland; and the latter, who was altogether disengaged, had not attempted any movement since Edward's arrival.* As if it had been fixed in the counsels of Providence that the house of Lancaster should become extinct, Henry, who had been a second time committed to the Tower by his victorious rival, closed his life soon after the fatal encounter at Tewkesbury. It was commonly believed at the time, and probably with truth, that he was murdered; and the odium of this crime has usually been attached to the memory of the duke of Gloucester, who has, whether justly or not, incurred the ban of historians, as a person capable of the most atrocious deeds. Mar garet, the high-spirited relict of that unfor tunate and singularly weak monarch, was detained in honourable captivity until, in 1475, she was ransomed by her kinsman, Louis of France, by the payment of fifty thousand crowns \u2014 an event which she survived about seven years. f The king of England could not fail to admit that these representations were just, and every hour's experience increased his conviction that little reliance was to be placed upon Burgundy, who had already visited and had hastily quitted his camp. St. Pol, as the moment of action arrived, halted irresolutely between the two parties ; and when the English approached St. Quentin, instead of giving the promised admission, he turned his cannon against their march.f Edward retired to Peronne, loudly accusing both his allies of treachery, and readily acquiesced in the preliminaries of a treaty which Louis was as prompt to offer. Having thus succeeded in completely crushing the Lancastrian party, Edward now turned his attention to continental affairs ; and in 1474 he entered into an alliance with the dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, the rivals of the French king. Relying on their aid, he demanded from Louis the immediate surrender of his crown, and collected an army of sixteen or eighteen thousand men to enforce his claims. Misled by false intelligence from the constable St. Pol, Louis prepared to resist a landing in Normandy, while Edward leisurely trans- The conditions were discussed at Amiens, where Louis took great pains to ingratiate himself with tbe English. He sent Edward a present of three hundred waggons laden with the choicest wines, and he ordered two huge tables to be profusely spread with dainties at the gates ofthe city (not omitting all provocatives to drinking), to which every comer was welcomed by some gentlemen of distinction, who were appointed to preside. * Hall, sol. 219-221.

[a.d. 1475. 392 cessions in order to purchase a treaty with his rival. He agreed that he would pay down immediately seventy-two thou sand crowns ; that the dauphin should marry Edward's eldest daughter, receiving Guienne as an appanage ; or that, in lieu of the revenues of that province an annuity of fifty thousand crowns should be paid during the ensuing nine years. Louis was utterly indifferent to the claims of either national or personal honour, but some of the more chivalrous of his nobles were indignant at the arrogance with which the English re ceived the money as tribute. The French man might have retorted with some justice that sixteen thousand crowns had been dis tributed among Edward's chief ministers as bribes.* This entertainment lasted during three or four days, and water, it is said, was the only supply wanting to the board.* The progress of the treaty was regarded with mutual jealousy by the duke of Burgundy and the constable; the former, returning to Edward's camp, held an angry interview with his wavering ally; the latter, pursuing his usual tortuous course, claimed merit with Louis by asserting that he had occasioned this breach. The king, how ever, was not so easily to be deceived, and he turned the representations of St. Pol against himself by a most unprincely strata gem. When the constable's messenger arrived, De Coutay, a retainer strongly attached to the duke of Burgundy, and at that time a prisoner on parole, happened to be in the royal apartment, and Louis ordered him to retire with Comines behind a large folding screen, which formed part of the furniture. The king then artfully encour aged De Creville, the envoy of St. Pol, to relate all the particulars of a conversation which his master had held with the duke The treaty was ratified at a personal interview which took place at Picquigny, on a bridge constructed for the purpose over the river Somme ; and Comines, who was present, has left an interesting account of the ceremony. A strong bar rier of trellis work, \" such as is fixed in a lion's cage,\" divided the bridge half-way. The princes were able to shake hands, but at the especial desire of Louis no wicket was inserted in it through which any passage could be made. To such a wicket, as he assured Comines, all the evil (or, as he gently characterized a long civil war arising out of a perfidious murder, all the \" inconvenience \") which occurred at Montereau was to be attributed. t Large bodies of armed men were stationed on the opposite banks of the river, but the attend ants who ascended the bridge with each monarch were limited to a dozen persons. After mutual salutations Louis said, \" My cousin, you are most welcome. There is not a man in the world whom I so much wished to see as yourself, and God be praised that we have met together for so good a purpose.\" Edward replied appro priately, and in right good French. The chancellor of England then joined in the conversation, and repeated an old prophecy of Burgundy. The agent, thinking to gratify Louis, and thus to advance his employer's interest, was by no means back ward in his narrative; and heightening the details by a successful mimicry of the duke's impetuous manner, he stamped with his foot, swore by St. George, called the king of England the bastard brat of an archer, and was lavish of similarly abusive language. The king laughed immoderately at the recital, and by pretending that he was beginning to grow deaf, and therefore that he heard but imperfectly, he persuaded De Creville, who was nothing loth, to repeat his buf foonery. De Coutay listened with indigna tion to this mockery of the prince whom he served, and by a report which he subse quently made to the duke of Burgundy of the licence which the constable permitted his followers to use, greatly increased the hatred which Charles already cherished against him.f Louis was by no means sparing in con- * Philippe de Comines, c. 74. f Id. c. 75. * Philippe de Comines c. 75-80. f Ibid."], [431, "A.d. 1475-1478.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 393 (\" a thing with which the English are always provided,\" says Comines) that Pic quigny should some day witness a great peace between France and England. The treaty was then read and approved ; each of tbe kings placing one hand upon a missal, the other upon a fragment of the true cross, swore to observe its conditions faithfully. When the two kings had sworn, \" our king,\" continues Comines, \" who had always words at command, told the Eng lish king in a jocose way, that he should be right glad to see him at Paris, and that if he would come and divert him self with the gay ladies there he would assign for his confessor the cardinal of Bourbon, who he knew would grant him easy absolution. The king of England was much pleased with this raillery, and made his majesty several smart repartees ; for he knew that the cardinal was a gay man with the ladies, and a boon companion.\" After a few words spoken in secret, the lords being sent to a distance, the contracting sove reigns shook hands through the grating, and took leave of each other. While rid ing back to Amiens, Louis expressed to Comines his uneasiness that Edward had seemed so willing to accept his invitation to Paris. \" He is a very handsome prince,\" he said, \" and a warm admirer of the ladies.

The youngest, Lady Anne, who had been betrothed to the son of Henry VI., was courted by Richard of Gloucester, who was desirous to share the immense fortune of which she was one of the heiresses. Clarence, who had suffered by the resumption of certain estates originally belonging to the crown, was not disposed to tolerate the meditated encroachment of his younger relative. He accordingly withdrew from court and studi ously rejected Edward's offered civilities, as proceeding from a show of affection which had no place in the heart, or as meant to cover designs which aimed at his interests as a prince of the blood. This alienation was further increased by a disappointment brought upon him by the king himself. His wife Isabella died in 1476, of poison administered by one of her female attend ants, who was condemned and executed for the crime. About the same time Charles the Rash, duke of Burgundy, was killed at the battle of Nanci, and Clarence immedi ately offered himself as a suitor to his only daughter, Mary, the heiress of his immense estates. Edward could not conceal the jealousy which the former conduct of his brother had occasioned; and apprehensive that the possession of a powerful dukedom might revive his ambitious feelings, he boldly refused his concurrence in the proposed union. Clarence could not conceal his in dignation, and his unguarded expressions and threats of vengeance were duly reported to the court. He was first of all attacked through his friends ; and one Stacey, a priest in his service, and Thomas Burdett, a gentleman of his household to whom he was much attached, were convicted and executed on a charge of witchcraft. Clarence con demned the haste or partiality of the judges, and thereby exposed himself to the fatal accusation that he had impeded the course of justice and insulted its principal ministers.

Albany on his part promised to do homage to Edward for his crown ; to renounce the ancient alliance with France ; to give up to England certain border districts, along with the town of Berwick and the castle of Lochmaben; and to marry one of the daugh ters of Edward as soon as he could make himself \" clear of other women,\" for he had two wives already. A number of the Scot tish nobles, headed by the earl of Angus and Lord Gray, gave their adherence to the treasonable paction of Albany with the English monarch, and consented to act as commissioners to carry out. its provisions. The Scottish king, James III., wholly una ware of his danger from the intrigues of these base traitors, assembled a powerful army at midsummer of 1482, and directed its march towards the border to repel the invasion of the English forces, which, under the command of Gloucester accompanied by Albany, were now on their march. But while James lay encamped at Lauder, his nobles, headed by the earl of Angus (sur named after this event \"Archibald Bell the Cat),\" seized the royal favourites and hanged them on the bridge at Lauder, and then retreated, carrying the king himself a pris oner to the castle of Edinburgh. The road to the capital was thus left open to the enemy, who had meanwhile obtained posses sion of the fortress of Berwick, which ever afterwards remained in the hands of the English. Gloucester and Albany reached Edinburgh, in the month of July, without opposition. But their presence in the capital made the better portion of the con federate nobles sensible of the folly as well as wickedness of their conduct; and the archbishop of St. Andrews, the bishop of Dunkeld, Lord Evandale, the chancellor, and the earl of Argyle, separated themselves from the cause of Albany and his associates, and assembled in considerable force at Haddington, in order to. maintain the rights throne the king and disinherit the king's children ; and other accusations equally monstrous and absurd. In spite of his vehe ment denial of every charge brought against him, Clarence was found guilty, and con demned to death on the 7th of February ( 1478 ) . Sentence was pronounced on him by the duke of Buckingham, who acted as high steward for the occasion; and he was com mitted to the Tower, where he was found dead after the lapse of about ten days. The common belies was that his brothers had secretly caused him to be drowned in a butt of malmsey wine.* In 1480 Edward's life of ease and plea sure and dissipation was disturbed by a war with Scotland \u2014 the result partly of the intrigues of the French king, and partly of the conduct of the English monarch himself. He had some time before betrothed his youngest daughter to the prince royal of Scotland, and had promised that her dowry of twenty thousand marks should be paid by annual instalments; but he now ceased to remit these instalments as they became due, and had returned an evasive answer when requested to fulfil the other provisions of the treaty between the two kingdoms. The cordiality between the two governments being thus shaken, hostilities soon broke out on the borders, and the earl of Angus crossed the marches and ravaged Northum berland. Edward, on the other hand, sent a powerful army under his brother, the duke of Gloucester, to invade Scotland (1481), while an English fleet at the same time appeared in the Firth of Forth ; but nothing of any importance was accomplished either by sea or land. In the following year the duke of Albany, the brother of the Scottish king and the leader of a party of malcontent nobles, returned from a short exile in France, and offered his services to the English monarch. Edward gladly welcomed the ambitious trai tor who laid claim to the Scottish crown, and concluded a treaty with him at Fother- * Rot. Parl. vol. vi. p. 173-195. Hist. Croyland, p. 502.

Through their intervention a os age, succeeded him on the throne under the title of Edward V.* reconciliation was effected between the kino and his brother, who was pardoned and restored to his estates and honours on his return to his allegiance. The English forces on this retired to their own country ; and it was agreed that the proposed alliance between the daughter of Edward and the eldest son of the Scottish king should be broken off, and that the sum which had been advanced as part of the dowry of the princess should be repaid. In less than six months Albany was again conspiring ao-ainst his brother, and opened a fresh negotiation with the English king, who promised to send him a body of three thousand archers to assist him in his treasonable designs on the Scottish throne. But the plot was dis covered, and Albany, who \u2014 apprehensive no doubt of the consequences of his intrigues \u2014 had fled into England, was summoned to answer for his treasonable practices. Having failed to appear, he and his principal accomplices were declared guilty of treason, and their possessions and honours were forfeited to the crown. Edward IV. was the handsomest man of his day, and he was possessed both of personal bravery and of considerable mental endowments ; but he was grossly licentious, fond of ease and pleasure, and had recourse to the meanest shifts in order to find money for his wasteful debaucheries. His reign is memorable for the introduction of the art of printing into England, Edward V. \u2014 a.d. 1483. The irregularities of the reign just closed led to much suffering and agitation imme diately after the decease of the king. His unequal marriage, by raising to power a number of individuals who properly be longed to an inferior station, excited great discontent among the more ancient nobility, the natural expectants of place and emolu ment under a monarchy which they had so materially contributed to support. The queen and her relations, thus inevitably exposed to envy and resentment, soon found arrayed against them a formidable party; of which the leaders were the duke of Buck ingham and Lord Hastings the chamberlain, together with Howard and Stanley, who were actuated by similar motives. Edward IV. had foreseen the evils likely to arise from this opposition among persons possessing so much weight in the country, and whose sentiments could not fail to influence its gov ernment; and accordingly, before he died, he exerted himself to the utmost to pro duce a reconciliation. He recommended, at the same time, that during the minority of his son the regency should be intrusted to the duke of Gloucester, who by rank dissimula tion had contrived to conceal from him the foulest parts of his character. Both factions paid their court to Richard, as being destined for a certain space to wield the sceptre of England in the name of his nephew; while he, on the other hand, who needed the aid of each, lent a ready ear to their respective proposals and solicitations. His ulterior By the treaty of Picquigny Louis had engaged that his son, the dauphin, should marry the eldest daughter of Edward as soon as she was of age. She was now in her sixteenth year, but the crafty French monarch, utterly regardless of his promise, thought it more advantageous for his interests that his son should marry the daughter of Maximilian, who, in right of his wife, succeeded the duke of Burgundy. Enraged at finding himself thus duped and insulted, Edward vowed that he would punish the old knave, and carry such a war into his kingdom as France had not yet seen.* But his health undermined by dis sipation, possibly also by chagrin, rapidly gave way, and he died aster an illness of a few weeks, on the 9th of April, 1483, in the twenty-first year of his reign and the fifty-second of his age, leaving two sons, the eldest of whom, not more than twelve years \u2022 Hist.

Lincoln chancellor in the room of the archbichop of York, and assigned the office of protector to the duke of Gloucester. The formality of declaring Gloucester pro- tector of the realm was hardly completed before he avowed among his adherents the intention of seizing upon the crown. He represented to Buckingham and Hastings that the severities which they had already practised upon the friends of the queen must render her a mortal and irreconcilable enemy ; and that, therefore, for their own sakes, they ought now to assist him in completing his undertaking by transferring the sceptre to a hand which would always be raised in their defence.* When Edward expired, in London, the duke of Gloucester was on the Scottish borders at the head of an army devoted to his service. Upon receiving the news of his brother's death he hastened southwards, and so arranged matters that he arrived at the town of Northampton on the same day (April 22nd) that the young king his nephew, travelling from Ludlow castle reached Stony Stratford, only ten miles distant, under the conduct of his maternal uncle, Earl Rivers. Here Gloucester was joined by the duke of Buckingham, who had already been plotting in his behalf and brought with him a retinue of three hundred horse. Having arranged their plans, the two dukes proceeded next day to Stony Stratford, where Gloucester on some frivolous pretext commanded Lord Rivers, as well as Sir Richard Gray, one ofthe queen's sons, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, a member of her house hold, to be arrested, and the whole party to be sent as prisoners to the stronghold at Pomfret, while the young king remained a prisoner in the hands of his uncle. This violent measure alarmed the queen so much that she fled with her daughters and the young duke of York into the sanctuary of Westminster, whence she was induced to return, not without great difficulty. She was, however, prevailed upon to commit her second son to the guardianship of his uncle, who, under the pretext of securing him from danger, placed him in the Tower; where he soon gave to him, as the com panion of his sorrows, his only brother the king.* These arguments gained the unscrupulous Buckingham, who for a season became the ready tool of the protector's ambition. But Hastings, who was attached to the children of Edward, would not listen to the base pro posal of setting them aside, and far less of removing them by murder. He himself was, therefore, doomed to lose his life,t and the unscrupulous Gloucester resolved to carry into execution with all speed his determination to put out of the way all who seemed likely to oppose his designs upon the crown. On the 13th of June he sud denly entered the Tower, and took his seat at the council table. The scene which followed has been minutely described by Sir Thomas More, and immortalized by Shakspeare. The protector presented him self about nine in the morning, says More, \"in a very merry humour.\" After some conversation with the lords he said to the bishop of Ely, \" My lord, you have very good strawberries in your garden in Holborn ; I request you let us have a mess of them.\" \" Gladly, my lord (quoth he) ; would to God I had some better thing ready to your pleasure as that ! \" and therewithal in all haste he sent his servants for a mess of strawberries.

After the lapse of an hour, he returned \" with a wonderful and an an- gry countenance,\" and fiercely accused his brother's widow and her friends, with his mistress, \" Shore's wife,\" of having wasted his body by \" their sorcery and witchcraft,\" and compassed his destruction. In proof of this strange assertion he plucked up his doublet sleeve to his elbow, upon his left arm, when the arm was seen to be withered and small, \" as it was never other.\" It was evident to all the mem- bers of the council that the protector was merely seeking a pretext for a quarrel with some one, and they all remained silent except Hastings, who said, \"Certainly, my lord, if they have so heinously done, they be worthy heinous punishment.\" \" What ! (quoth the protector) thou servest me, I ween, with ifs and with ands? I tell thee they have so done, and that I will make good on thy body, traitor ! And therewith,\" continues the chronicler, \"as in a great anger, he clapped his fist upon the board a great rap. At which token one cried treason, without the chamber. Therewith a door clapped, and in came there rushing men in harness, as many as the chamber might hold. And now the protector said to the Lord Hastings, ' I arrest thee, traitor.' 'What? me, my lord' (quoth he)! 'Yes, thee! traitor' (quoth the protector). An- other let fly at the Lord Stanley, which shrunk at the stroke and fell under the table, or else his head had been cleft to the teeth ; for as shortly as he shrunk, yet ran the blood about his ears. Then were they quickly bestowed in diverse chambers, except the lord chamberlain (Hastings), whom the protector bade speed and shrive him apace, 'for by St. Paul (quoth he), I will not to dinner till I see thy head off.'\" The unfortunate nobleman was instantly seized by the body of armed men who had rushed into the council-chamber at the signal given by Richard ; they hurried him to the green beside the Tower chapel, stretched his I neck over a log of wood which happened to lie there, and struck off his head. Lord Stanley, the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Ely, were at the same time arrested and shut up in separate cells in the Tower. On the same day on which these proceedings took place in London, the Earl Rivers, Lord Gray, Sir Thomas Vaughan, and Sir Richard Hawse, were put to death at Ponte fract castle, without any form of trial. Earl Rivers, who was thus foully murdered, was an accomplished man, the friend of literary men, and the patron of Caxton the first English printer. The celebrated Jane Shore \u2014 the best known and best beloved of the late king's numerous mistresses \u2014 was brought before the ecclesiastical court, and condemned to do public penance for her sins. Clothed only in her kirtle, barefooted, and carrying a lighted taper in her hand, she was compelled to walk through the crowded streets of the city on a Sunday, for the purpose of fixing public attention upon the immoralities of the late king, and inducing the people to look with a favourable eye on the protector as a reformer of morals. This scene was followed by a sermon preached at St. Paul's Cross, to a great crowd of people, by Dr. Shaw \u2014 a very popular preacher of the day. He boldly denied the legitimacy of the young princes in the Tower, and even of their father himself. The arguments of the doc- tor were founded on an assertion made by Richard, for the purpose of giving a certain air of plausibility to his claim, that the late king, before he espoused the Lady Elizabeth Gray, had contracted a private marriage with Eleanor Boteler, daughter of the earl of Shrewsbury, and consequently that the issue by the second union could not bo legiti- mate. He had even the baseness to allow his partizans to maintain that, owing to the infidelities of his own mother when duchess of York, his two brothers, Edward IV. and the duke of Clarence, were spurious, and not, in reality, the children of their reputed father. It is unnecessary to mention that he made no attempt to adduce any proof in"], [436, "[a.d. 1483. 398 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. support of these calumnies ; his purpose being fully served when he found that the sentiments of the nation were thereby divided, and that doubts were now enter tained where none had formerly existed. Richard III. \u2014 a.d. 1483-1485 It was on the 26th of June, 1483, little more than ten weeks after the death of Edward IV., that Richard ascended the throne. This event was soon followed by the murder of the two princes in the Tower, who, after being suffocated \u2014 under the direction of Sir James Tyrrel, master of the horse to Richard \u2014 by two ruffians named Miles Forest and John Dighton, were buried \" at the soot of the stairs, deep in the ground, under a heap of stones.\"* Nothing at this stage appeared wanting but the choice or consent of the people, to complete the pretensions of Richard to the throne of England. To supply this defect, he instructed an obsequious lord mayor how to call forth the acclamations of the multitude whom he had assembled in the city with that view ; and no sooner had a few boys exclaimed, \" God save King Richard,\" than the voice of the nation was said to have declared itself in favour of Gloucester as their true and lawful sovereign. A depu tation of the citizens, headed by Shaw the mayor, and accompanied by the duke of Buckingham and many lords and gentle men, then waited upon the protector at Baynard castle, where he resided, to inform him that the people called upon him to ascend the throne. Affecting a reluctance which he did not feel, the usurper at last seemed to hesitate whether he should accept the crown, the desire for which had stirred up every bad passion in his heart ; and while in the very act of stretching forth his hand to grasp it, he recommended loyalty towards his nephew, a feeling which he declared he was himself resolved to cherish. At this moment the duke of Buckingham, who had likewise his part to act in this miserable scene of hypocrisy and bloodshed, stepped forward and pre sented an address in the name of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commoners of this realm of England, setting forth the illegitimacy of Edward's children by Eliza beth Woodville, in consequence of his prior marriage to Eleanor Boteler, and inviting Richard to the crown as his by right of birth, and by lawful election of the three estates of the land. On this the protector, after a little affected hesitation, professed his willingness to comply with the wishes of the people, and the brief nominal reign of Edward V. terminated without a struggle. But the wily tyrant soon discovered that he who ascends to power by the sacrifice of humanity on his own part, and by employing as instruments the wild passions of revenge, avarice, and envy in the minds of others, enjoys neither security nor re spect. His knowledge of the selfish motives through which the co-operation of bad men is obtained, filled his spirit with apprehen sion lest the evil arts which he himself had suggested or approved should now be turned against his own person or government ; and hence the first fears which disturbed his reign respected Buckingham, to whose intrigues and extensive influence he owed the accomplishment of his most ambitious scheme. The causes from which the dis content of this powerful but unprincipled nobleman originated, cannot now be ascer tained with any degree of exactness. It has, indeed, been conjectured that Richard did not gratify to the full extent his inordinate appetite for wealth ; or that, dreading his restless temper, the king had betrayed symptoms of jealousy and alarm, the effects of which were justly regarded by the duke as full of danger to his life and fortune. It has been conjectured that the murder of the two innocent youths in the Tower, which could not fail to alienate from the usurper every sensitive heart, may have cooled the affections of Buckingham ; * but there is clear evidence that the duke had engaged to put him self at the head of an insurrection before * More, p. 67 t Dugdale, vol. i. p. 168."], [437, "A.D. 1483.] HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 399 the murder of the princes was known ; so that his alienation from the monarch, to whose rise he had so largely contributed, must have proceeded from some other cause. Henry V. Edmund, already created Earl of Richmond, had by this wife one son, who was baptized by the name of Henry, and became the heir of his titles and fortune. It is true that Somerset had proceeded from the house of Lancaster through a spurious channel ; but care was taken to remedy this defect in his blood by an Act of Parliament, which restored him to legitimacy, and saved all the rights which might happen to accrue to his children as cadets of the royal family. Hence it is manifest that the young earl was now invested with all the claims which belonged to the Lancastrian branch of tbe Plantagenets ; a circumstance which rendered his union with Elizabeth extremely desirable to all the lovers of peace, who saw in it a satisfactory termination of the sanguinary contest between the two Roses, and the establishment of an indisputable line of succession.* As to the right of the Princess Elizabeth to the throne there could be no question, except on the ground assumed by Richard, that the marriage between her father and Elizabeth Woodville was invalid, owing to the previous contract already mentioned. But that he was not serious in this objec tion appears manifest from the attempt which he made to procure for himself the hand of his niece after the death of his queen ; being certain that, had he suc ceeded in this matrimonial project, he would have removed from the field his most for midable rival by merging Elizabeth's claim in his own. Nothing, perhaps, could set in a stronger light the fascinating powers of Richard, than the fact that he prevailed upon the widow of Edward IV., though he had murdered her brother and three of her sons, to consent to the union of her daughter with the man whom, of all others, she had the greatest reason to hate and sus pect. His conquest of the Lady Anne, so soon after he had aided in the assassination of her youthful husband Prince Edward, the son of Henry VI., is selected by our great national poet as the triumph of a vigorous intedect over the impotent rage of a feeble mind. But Richard had assuredly still more reason to boast of his eloquence and his mastery over a woman's heart, when he obtained the consent of the queen dowager to place her eldest daughter beside him on a throne stained with the blood of nearly all her family.* A connection between Henry Tudor and Buckingham had been previously formed by the marriage of Margaret, the mother of the earl, with Sir Henry Stafford, uncle to the duke. The same lady afterwards became the wife of Lord Stanley; but as she bore no children to either of these husbands, the young Richmond continued to be the sole heir of her wealth and pretensions. The death of Henry VI., and the murder of his son Prince Edward, gave a new importance to the prospects which opened upon the Tudors ; turning the eyes of all the Lancas trians to their family, as the only remaining branch of an illustrious stock which they were unwilling to see so near extinction. Edward IV., who saw not the real danger with which his children were threatened, allowed his mind to be oppressed with apprehension in regard to the troubles which might arise after his decease from the title of the earl of Richmond, if supported by the adherents of the Red Rose. With this view he endeavoured to obtain posses sion of his person by applying to the duke of Brittany, into whose dominions he had been carried, either to deliver him up to an The earl of Richmond was a descendant of the renowned John of Gaunt by the female line.

At a later period he expressed a desire to have him sent over, in order that he might be united in marriage to Elizabeth \u2014 a project which, whether seriously entertained or not by the crafty monarch, if it had been really executed, would perhaps have anticipated the advantages of Bosworth-field, and have prevented the bloodshed which disgraced the administration of Richard. of five thousand men, partly English and partly foreigners, whom he had embarked on board a small squadron destined for the invasion of his native country; but, as the wind was unfavourable, he did not reach the coast until the efforts of his friends had proved entirely unavailing. When the fate of Buckingham was made known to him, he resolved to return to his asylum in Brittany, and there to wait the arrival of a more propitious season for disputing the throne with his warlike rival. The hatred and suspicion which were everywhere directed against the protector gave great encouragement to the plans of his enemies. The duke of Buckingham, who took the lead, found himself ably seconded by the bishop of Ely and others, who, from their detestation of the tyrant, were eager to place the government on a different basis. The queen-dowager, too, consented to suppress her opposition to the Lancastrians and to afford assistance to Henry, in the capacity of her future son-in law and king. But the vigilance of Richard could not be so easily deceived as to make him remain ignorant of the schemes which were formed against his throne. Assembling a small number of troops, under pretence of watching the Scottish border, he invited Buckingham to appear at head-quarters, where his counsel and services might be required. But the duke, aware of the real intention which dictated this order, retired into Wales, and instantly began to levy forces, as the prelude to a general insurrec tion. His designs, however, were thwarted by the inclemency of the weather, which rendered the rivers impassable. His troops, struck with superstition or exhausted by want and fatigue, deserted from him ; and at length he was betrayed, by one of his servants named Banister, into the hands of the king, who immediately commanded him to be executed at Salisbury as a traitor.* The disappointment sustained by his enemies conferred upon Richard additional strength and security. Penetrating their motives, as well as the plan which they intended to pursue, he determined to counteract their proceedings by tearing from their hands the instruments which they were meditating to employ against him. It was at this crisis that he proposed to marry the daughter of his brother, after removing all obstacles by procuring, as was thought, the death of his wife, and by ap plying for a papal dispensation to authorize the union of two persons so nearly related. Meantime, he induced Parliament to recog nize his title as the lawful sovereign of England, and to grant him a liberal supply of money for carrying on the affairs of government. His son, too, then a boy not exceeding twelve years of age, was created Prince of Wales, and acknowledged as the true heir to the crown* During this interval the earl of Richmond found his party daily increasing in number as well as confidence, and a stronger desire entertained by the exiles who crowded to his court to precipitate the usurper from the throne. Doubting the ability or the in clination of the duke of Brittany to protect him from the machinations of Richard, he repaired to Charles VIII., who had now suc ceeded his father, Louis XL, and solicited his countenance and aid. The politics of the new king were favourable to any enter- This disaster defeated for a time the attempt to place Henry of Richmond on the throne.

In the month of August, accord ingly, Henry sailed from Harfleur, accom panied by two thousand men, and landed at Milford Haven, in Wales, where he knew his friends could assemble with the least fear of opposition from the arms of Richard. morning the two armies encountered to the south of that town, in the midst of a spacious plain nearly surrounded by hills. \"There,'' in the words of a contemporary chronicler, \"was fought a sharp battle, and sharper should it have been if the king's party had been fast to him ; but many, towards the field, refused him and rode on to the other party, and some stood hovering afar off till they saw to which party the victory should fall.\"* Conspicuous among these was Lord Stanley, who had married the mother of the earl of Richmond, and was naturally an object of suspicion to Richard. He had raised a large body of troops, but had hitherto, under various pre tences, evaded the orders of the king to join the royal army. On the other hand, though secretly inclined towards Henry, he was afraid to declare in his favour; Lord Stanley, his son, being kept a close prisoner by Richard as a hostage for the loyalty of the Stanleys. The duke of Norfolk, who led the royal van, began the battle by a fierce attack upon the advanced guard of the enemy, which was commanded by the old earl of Oxford \u2014 the famous Lancas trian leader ; but though he made a great impression, he was not supported by the other divisions ofthe army. At this critical moment Lord Stanley declared for Rich mond, and directed his troops against the post which tbe usurper occupied. Richard, whose presence of mind never forsook him, now perceived that his only chance of success depended upon the death or capture of his competitor ; and putting spurs to his horse, he galloped into the midst of the enemy, and made a desjDerate attempt to cut his way to the spot where Henry stood. So furious was his onset that for a brief space he bore down all opposition, killed Sir William Brandon (Henry's stand ard bearer) and Sir John Cheney, wounded several others, and had nearly reached the earl of Richmond himself, when a whole host of enemies closed upon him and dis patched him with many wounds. His bat- Some months before this occurrence, the king had directed writs to be issued to all sheriffs, informing them that certain persons had conspired with the duke of Brittany to invade England. He mentioned by name Jasper and Henry Tudor, the earl of Oxford, and Sir John Woodville, adding that the greater part of the rebels were \" open murderers, adulterers, and extor tioners.\" He further asserted that the exiles had chosen Henry Tudor to be their chief, who already usurped the royal estate of England, whereunto he had no interest, title, or colour, being descended of bastard blood on both sides* But Richard did not trust to proclama tions alone. Though deserted by most of his friends, he took the field with his usual courage and despatch, and prepared to meet the invader. He raised his standard at Nottingham, where the earl of Northumber land repaired to it at the head of a strong body of his hardy northern retainers. At Leicester the usurper was joined by the duke of Norfolk, Lord Lovel, and Sir Richard Brackenbury, who brought up tbe levies from Hampshire, London, and the eastern counties. Meanwhile Henry, who had landed at Milford Haven on the 7th of August, with about four thousand men, crossed the Severn and marched towards the centre of the kingdom. On the 21st he moved from Tamworth to Atherstone, where he was joined by numerous deserters from the royal army. On the same day Richard marched from Leicester, and en camped at Bos worth.

The duke of Norfolk, Lord Ferrers, Sir Richard Ratclifte, Sir Robert Brackenbury, and a few other knights with about three thousand men, shared tbe fate of their master; the remainder sought safety in a rapid flight. The body of the king, which was found among a heap of slain, covered with blood, was conveyed to Leicester with out any marks of honour, and interred in the church of the Greyfriars in that town. private letters still preserved in collections, it is certain that the nobles interested them selves deeply in the return of members to the Lower House; not, however, on all occasions, because they wished to guide their deliberations, but rather because the right of sitting in Parliament was so little valued that many counties and boroughs must have continued unrepresented, if knights and citizens had not been encour aged to assume that duty. It is true there are also abundant proofs, that both the king and the great vassals of the crown interfered in elections to an extent which would now be considered as quite inconsistent with liberty and independence ; whence an infer ence may be drawn that the voice of the Commons had already acquired a consider able importance in the decision of all matters which respected finance, taxation, and com merce. The arts too, and the elements of general improvement, began to expand them selves, even amid the disasters and alarm which are inseparable from a civil war. The towns had experienced the benefits of a free trade ; the peasantry in many parts had risen into yeomen, and were enjoying all the comforts and respectability which belong to that order of society; and even the lowest classes were no longer strangers to the blessings of personal freedom. These circumstances called for the praise and con gratulation of two distinguished writers who flourished in that age \u2014 Philippe de Corn mines and Sir John Fortescue. The issue of this memorable fight ap peared in the settlement of all those disputes respecting the right to govern the kingdom, which had distracted the nation from the period at which Henry IV. ascended the throne; the pretensions of the two great families which sprung from Edward III. being harmonized by the union of their legal representatives in the persons of Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, and Elizabeth Plantagenet, daughter of Edward IV. During the period now specified, from 1399 to 1485, the progress of liberty was constant, though slow, and better established, perhaps, in the statute-book than in the actual administration of affairs. Henry IV., who was opposed by a large proportion of the nobility, threw himself upon the com mons for support, and, in return for their countenance and aid, was ever ready to extend their privileges in Parliament, and to liberate their franchise from the undue influence of the aristocracy.

Yet in dealing with so necessary a feature in the narration, there is some difficulty in assigning their just importance to such periods and events as have most conduced to the material grandeur of the kingdom, without encumbering space with details that belong rather to the Chroni- cs cler than to the historian, presenting as they do, not the history of commerce properly so called, but rather the crude mass of materials and of the mariners from Sidon and Tyre, who resorted to the Scilly Islands for tin, have relation to occurrences so remote as to be included in the mythical period of our annals; while the voyages of the Gauls, bent upon exchanging their dyed cloth and other continental commodities for the bronze and iron, the cattle and the pelts of Britain, must be classed among matters that pertain to arch\u00e6ological and antiquarian research. The presence of the Roman legions, who were the principal consumers, infused little or no abiding influence among people who probably possessed neither sea-going ships to export the corn and other produce of their own soil, nor coined money to purchase the commodities of other countries: and the pearls and oysters of these islands, in whatever esteem they may have been held at Rome, were but insignificant means wherewith to form the nucleus of a trade with the Italy of other times. from wdrich history has to be digested. We can no more exalt the rude barter of the Britons, or the industry of this country in the early ages, to the dignity of trade, than we could give the character of a philo sophical theory to the disconnected phe nomena ofthe earth's surface, before geology had collated and organized them into a branch of natural science. The Anglo-Saxons, devoted to agricul ture, remained indifferent to trade, and it was not until the Danes introduced the knowledge of navigation that trading vessels from the English havens brought commercial life into British waters. Intercourse with British trade, strictly considered, may be regarded as belonging to our own cen tury, and more especially to the portion of it which we may call our own times.

II remoter countries followed, encouraged by the solicitude of King Alfred; and later, in the reign of Athelstane, every merchant who should have thrice crossed the sea with his own cargo in his own ship was entitled to claim the rank of a Thane. were comparatively neglected. The English had little to export for which a demand existed abroad; and the commodities which we find incidentally mentioned as being introduced from other countries were chiefly articles of luxury \u2014 such as silks, furs, and jewels, wine, oil, and ivory. On these dues and customs were still levied, as they had been from the time of the Romans, both on account of the king, and of the feudal lords ofthe seaports. Under such auspices the activity of mer chants received its first stimulus ; and the chroniclers of the Norman Conquest dwell with interest on the number of foreign ships which they found frequenting the Thames and the ports on the southern coast, as well as on the wealth and substance possessed by the traders in the great towns. Intercourse was then carried on between the Cinque Ports and France, and an active interchange subsisted between Bristol and the opposite shores of Ireland. In the beginning of the twelfth century a colony of Flemings, encouraged by Henry I., introduced the art of weaving woollen cloth into England ; and this, with the ex ception of working in metals, was probably the first manufacture extensively encouraged in these islands. The colony was increased under succeeding kings, and the industry seems to have flourished. But these efforts were not sustained. During the reigns of the later Anglo-Saxon kings the power and influence of the clergy had so increased, that at the death of Edward the Confessor more than one-third of all the lands of England was supposed to be in their hands. The appropriation of so large a portion of the soil to the uses of the church was of itself prejudicial to the gene ral interests of the people ; but the teaching of the clergy still further militated against the material advancement of the nation. The age was one of pilgrimages and pen ances, and those who performed them, comprising no inconsiderable part of the community, were exposed to the waste not merely of time and money, but of health and of life itself. In the eleventh century originated the Crusades, which for upwards of two cen turies afterwards were the occasion of a continuous though uncertain communication with the East, not only introducing to the English some knowledge of the productions of Asia, but tending to familiarize them with those of the intermediate European nations traversed on the outward and homeward march of those extraordinary expeditions. To the crusaders Europe was indebted for the knowledge of the silkworm and the method of rearing it; and in process of time the introduction of raw silk from Italy added another to the nascent industries of the British Islands. Exeter, Winchester, and Gloucester were enriched in the twelfth The defeat of Harold and the accession of the Norman Conqueror were attended with consequences most unfavourable to the improvement of the internal condition of the kingdom; and from the reign of William I. to that of Henry III., civil strife and foreign wars so enfeebled the energies of the people, that trade and its attendant pursuits century by the favour in which they were held for their wines, made from grapes grown in the respective localities. But this branch of trade has long since disappeared, partly, it is said, from changes in the climate of these islands, but much more probably from the ascertained superiority of wines"], [443, "BRITISH COMMERCE. III imported from France and the Spanish peninsula. Lynn, Norwich, Lincoln, York, Whitby, and other places on the eastern coast, enjoyed, from their vicinity to the German Ocean, an active and lucrative intercourse with the opposite ports in Flan ders and the Low Countries. It is true that at different times, and more especially towards the end of the eighteenth century, considerable progress was made both in home and foreign commerce; but it was not until after the close of the great European wars consequent on the French Revolution, that the laws affecting trade were discussed in this country in a calm and philosophic spirit. And these discus sions, as they proceeded, served for the first time to disclose to the nation the prodigious strength of its commercial powers when liberated from the overgrowth of parasitic interests encouraged by the unwholesome influences of past legislation. In an historical view of British trade, the interest attaching to these remote times arises mainly from their disclosure of the germs and sources of the various industries from whose subsequent development sprung the wealth and commercial pre-eminence of the empire. And yet, down to a very recent period, the history of that development is less a relation of the spontaneous increase and expansion of the commerce of England, than an exposure ofthe perpetually recurring difficulties imposed by the policy of succes sive kings and local authorities. But in defiance of ad obstacles the mercantile spirit of the nation, reliant on its own strength, rose buoyant and elastic, retaining its hardy growth notwithstanding the discouragement of unjust and unwise enactments. The long period of peace which now occurred permitting attention to be given to scientific and industrial pursuits, tended materially to the advancement of trade. When the storm of national animosity engendered by long hostilities had spent its force, and a calm came upon the country, thoughtful minds were found to point out the folly of the obstructive laws and regtdations, discouraging to the foreigner undoubtedly, but inflicting a double injury upon the English people, by inducing a spirit of retaliation abroad, and thus con ducing to conditions detrimental alike to the agent and the object. For six hundred years, from the thir teenth to the nineteenth century, the course of legislation in England, while ostensibly designed for the promotion of native manu factures, was practically calculated for their discouragement. At home the authority oT the crown was exercised in the issue of charters and letters patent on behalf of monopolies, and where freedom was permitted its main result was only the exposure of a larger area for taxation ; while in our intercourse with other countries, the interests of international commerce were subordinated to the exigencies of political relations, and the right of admitting or contracting importations was not unfre quently used almost as a munition of war, to coerce or conciliate refractory powers on the Continent. Looking at the subject broadly, the his tory of British trade appears to divide itself into two periods : the first, when even under the most favourable circumstances a vicious system of legislation made free exchange on a large scale impossible; the second, when the beneficial results of the removal of burdens thus imposed by injudicious legisla tion had been made manifest. It is expedient, therefore, to treat it accordingly: in the first place, narrating concisely the salient facts illustrative of the progress of British trade from an early age to the close of the late restrictive system; and in the second,"], [444, "BRITISH COMMERCE. IV pointing out the advantages which have resulted from the revisal of that policy, and the inauguration of absolute freedom in commerce and exchange. products of our manufacturing industry in exchange. European governments, as regarded trade, had with rare exceptions maintained a \" system of isolation,\" with greater or less modification. This system consisted in the establishment of privileged manufactories, of monopolies, and of protective customs' tariffs. It took growth about the middle ofthe seventeenth century; and, conforma bly to the views of the economists of those days, aimed at forcing national industry to the acquirement of money: the leading principle being that the productive power of each state was to be as far as possible sufficient to supply the home demand\u2014 to buy nothing abroad, but to sell all it could, and in return to be paid in gold. Taking a view of the state of affairs about half a century ago, the time when the first glimmerings of the free-trade policy made their appearance, it will be found that the general aspect of commercial under takings, not only in England but throughout Europe, was then gloomy in the extreme, with a tendency in favour of the belief that the tide of civilization was ebbing from the Old World and setting towards the New. The truth, however, was, that so far as Eng land was concerned, she had then fairly started in her career as a manufacturing nation, and consequently had drawn the larger portion of the wealth of the country from agricultural pursuits to those of manu facturing industry. But at the same time, though a signal improvement had taken place in the mode of living at home, demand ing a far larger amount of national pro ductions than formerly, and though the population had vastly increased, the manu facturing powers of England were still in excess of the home demand, while no sufficient outlet presented itself abroad The majority of the foreign markets were closed against English products by obstruc tive tariffs and vexatious fiscal regulations. Moreover, as regards the food of the people, the increase of population, a source of pros perity in itself, was fast overtaking the capabilities of the soil, limited as it is in its geographical extent, to yield the necessary supply. Notwithstanding every improve ment in agricultural processes, it became evident that England would have to look elsewhere for the prime necessity of existence. But here again, though foreign nations were found ready enough to send us grain and cattle, they were unwilling to take the Even under this system, bad as it was, some progress was made in Great Britain; for nature is more powerful than govern ments, and commerce rose, though by slow degrees, in spite of all prohibitions and restrictions. But its combined effect, pre dominant as it was throughout Europe, tended in the long run to prevent any extensive foreign trade ; and England was now beginning to realize the injurious consequences resulting from its adoption. Her manufacturing powers had become prodigiously expanded by the giant force of steam, and such was the increase of her production that, without the discovery of further outlets, it threatened to become a source of danger. Impatience at restriction was further excited by the new facilities for transport created by railroad communication, with its attendant advantages of security and punctuality, as well as of economy and speed. Irrespective of the teachings of education, the promptings of commercial instinct arrayed the working man, as well as the employer, against a system so unwise in its conception, and so detrimental in its"], [445, "BRITISH COMMERCE V results. Almost without the conscious process of argument men came instinctively to the conclusion that as individual talents were ordained for universal advantage, so the gifts of Providence to nations were designed, not for particular countries, but for mankind. Once awakened to this con viction, the former theory of isolation was condemned as a theory of selfishness, un sound in its conception and unattainable in its aim. The flame thus kindled, slowly but surely throughout the kingdom, led almost every manufacturing interest to coalesce in one earnest appeal to the British legislature to inaugurate the reign of free exchange and unfettered trade; the firm conviction being, that the change, once inaugurated and commenced by Great Britain, would in process of time induce the governments of every enlightened nation in the world to emulate the generous example. while that from another was refused equal privileges; some exports were subjected to duty, and some imports were exempted. In short, the whole tariff regulations be trayed a want of system and uniformity, or of adherence to any fixed principle of taxation. It remained for Sir. R. Peel to initiate, in 1842, the new free-trade system, based exclusively on the requirements of finance and revenue, and ignoring absolutely the doctrines of monopoly and protection. All duties which tended to check trade without benefiting the state were abolished. Raw materials employed in manufactures or as necessaries of life were exempted from duty. The system, moreover, provided for unre stricted intercourse with foreign countries, and for the abolition of all differential duties and advantages enjoyed by excepted nations. The corn laws, and the laws which im posed restrictions on navigation, underwent in turn a similar searching revision; and other restrictive measures originally imposed for the exclusive benefit of a class, shared the fate of other obnoxious regulations and were buried among things of the past. The alteration from one system to the other, although progressive, was slow. During twenty years from 1820, things remained in a transition state. It is true that from time to time tariff modifications were effected, and that duties on many commodities were advantageously reduced. But these changes were of such a contra dictory character that it became evident that the legislature had been guided by no definite or confident principle. Thus, while in one year the duty on some articles was reduced, in the year following it was sub jected to an increase. On luxuries the tax was at one time diminished, while almost simultaneously on some of the necessaries of life it was unwisely augmented. The produce from one colony was savoured, That which it is competent for us now to record within the compass available for this section of British history is, in the first instance, the main features of the antiquated system as it endured previous to the advent of free trade ; in the second, the results that have as yet been realized in England since the introduction of more enlightened prin ciples; and lastly, the influence which the conduct of England exerted in inducing the other states of Europe to pursue a similar line of policy."], [446, "CHAPTER I.

But apart from the unfavourable influences of disaffection and revolt at home, the aspect of society abroad was little favourable to the encouragement of international trade. The growth of manufactures in all countries is more or less determined by the growth of civilization, and by the progress of society from rudeness \u2022and simplicity to luxury and refinement. It was not until the close of the thirteenth century that this advance became distinctly appreciable in England; and even then, so consistently injudicious was the course of legislation, that the sumptuary laws, and the restraints which they imposed upon the comforts of life and the elegance of apparel, are evidence at once of the greater diffusion of wealth and the unwise policy which pre judiced trade by imposing unsound restric tions upon its development. Added to this was the insecurity of movable property, and the consequent difficulty attending its accumulation, the want of roads and the means for the transmission of merchandise ; Emerging from the obscurity of the remoter ages of British commerce, and approaching the periods of more historic accuracy, the events connected with trade, few as they are, will be found chiefly remarkable as dlustrating the discouragements already alluded to, entailed by the apathy or error of those in authority, and the hurtful and oppressive enactments under which their more active policy was pursued. The tendency of the times in this gloomy era amounted to an interdiction of progress. To the revolts and insurrections consequent upon the division of the lands of England among the followers of the Conqueror, suc ceeded wars and expeditions by which his successors were forced to defend the crown against the aspiring designs of their Norman kinsmen; and in the absence of any first principle to regulate the succession, the demise of the king was the signal for intes tine commotions and exhausting civil strife. The prolonged jealousy between the crown and the church was in itself a chronic cause of obstruction to social development; and concurrently with this, the exciting episode of the Crusades served for more than two centuries to divert the ordinary pursuits of life. The extended dominion concentrated"], [447, "BRITISH COMMERCE VII the risk of plunder by robbers being aggra vated by the certain extortion of the feudal proprietors within whose reach it might chance to fall. the general commerce of Europe. The internal trade was carried on chiefly at fairs, which in those days were of great import ance. It does not fall within the scope of these remarks to point out the bearing of imposts and duties levied from time to time, without any fixed object in view other than that of obtaining money for the public exchequer; and indeed it woidd not be easy to do so, owing to the frequent changes which occurred in the system of taxation. It may be noted, however, that the internal duties on the sale of all kinds of goods were very heavy, and greatly impeded trade ; whilst the laws regulating the food and clothing of the poorer classes of the popula tion no less contributed to check production and confine the energies of manufacturers. It was not until the reign of Henry III. that the country could be considered in a fit state for commercial undertakings. A land mainly covered by forests and marshes, and with very little means of commun ication, afforded few opportunities to the inhabitants, as far as commerce was con cerned, beyond the rearing of sheep and cattle. Wool and hides consequently formed the staple articles of their trade or exchange with other countries.* Scattered notices of the nature and amount of trade at different epochs may indeed be found interwoven with the narratives of historians, but the authorities for such statements are usually obscure, and there is no reason for believing that the officers employed in those days for collecting the king's revenue, cared for anything beyond the rigid exaction of the imposts allowed by law. Many enactments affecting foreign com merce were passed, as the country assumed an independent character. But the majority proved great impediments to trade. It was the policy ofthe legislature to induce foreign merchants to import the commodities of their respective countries, and export those of England. With this view many statutes were passed for the encouragement of mer chant strangers settled in London and the chief towns, by forming them into companies with exclusive privileges. Of these com panies, the most ancient was that of the German merchants of the Steel-yard, who had long been rich and flourishing, chiefly through connection with the famous confed eracy of the Hanse Towns. The merchants ofthe Staple formed also a commercial union of considerable importance, both from the number of its members and the extent of its transactions. The objects of this com pany were two-fold: \u2014 First, to buy and collect the staple commodities of the king dom, which were wool, wool-fells, leather, lead, and tin, and convey them to certain towns called the Staple Towns, that the As a natural consequence of the large supply of the staple, the manufacture of woollen goods formed the most important domestic industry of those times; but its permanent establishment in the country may be said to date from the immigration of the Flemings, to which reference has already been made. Independently of their activity, however, a large quantity of Eng lish wool was exported to Flanders, and returned in a manufactured shape. Until the reign of Henry VII. there are very few records bearing upon the develop ment of commerce. The foreign trade was chiefly in the hands ofthe foreign merchants, principally Italians, who enjoyed a monopoly \u2014 in later times shared by the Dutch \u2014 of * The export trade in tin from Cornwall, which had been carried on from remotest antiquity, was confined to that par ticular district."], [448, "BRITISH COMMERCE VIII king's customs might be securely collected, and that foreigners might know where to find such commodities in abundance; and secondly, to export these staple wares, re ceiving in return goods, coin, or bullion. Natives as well as foreigners might be employed in the first object, but foreigners only in the second. Merchants of the Staple were exempt from the jurisdiction of the ordinary magistrates, and subjected only to the authority of the mayor and constables of the staple, chosen annually in each of the staple towns, and empowered to adjudicate all disputes by the law of merchants, not by the common law. The staple towns for England, Wales, and Ireland, were (27 Edward III. c. 24) Newcastle-upon-Tyne, York, Lincoln, Norwich, Westminster, Can terbury, Chichester, Winchester, Exeter, Bristol, Caermarthen, Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and Drogheda. number of guilds and incorporated trades bear witness to the progress of national industry at this time ; though we may well conceive that the exclusive privileges granted to most of these associations proved disad vantageous to the bulk of the population, and tended eventually to retard the progress of the country. Burnet states that in the year 1552 trade had arrived at an unexampled point of prosperity. The increased mag nificence of courts had led to an augmen tation in the consumption of costly articles ; cloth being mentioned as receiving a par ticular impetus. The discovery of the Indies caused a quicker circulation of wealth. The merchants of Antwerp and Hamburg, through the fortunate situation of those cities, had the chief trade of the world; and the English began to look upon these Easterlings with envy. Our exportations and importations were conducted for the most part in their shipping. All markets were in their hands, so that commodities of foreign growth were vended by them in England, at the same time that they bought up the products of the kingdom ; and these products had increased, not only in staple, but in manufacture. Thus our own wool, which had been formerly wrought at Ant werp, was now made into cloth in England, the Steel-yard men having leave to carry it away. At first they shipped not above eight cloths in a year, after that a hundred, then a thousand, then six thousand: but this last year there were shipped in their name forty-four thousand cloths ; the whole amount taken by competing interests being only eleven hundred. The accession of Henry VII. was favour able to trade in the first place by bringing peace; and the rule of that monarch was distinguished by many beneficial changes in commercial conditions. The introduction of navigation laws to a certain extent took the carrying trade of the country out of the hands of the Dutch shipowners, while the discovery of the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope paved the way to the destruction of the monopoly long enjoyed by the Italians of supplying Europe with the produce of the East, and gave an impetus to the general trade of Europe, in which England was not slow to participate. Commercial treaties were also entered into at this time, the most important being that concluded between England and Burgundy in 1496. A main purpose of these treaties was to restrain the piratical spirit of mariner adventurers, who could seldom withstand the temptation of preying upon weaker vessels than their own. The increasing The result of this great prosperity obtained by the Steel-yard company led the merchant adventurers to institute a complaint against these foreign traders ; and the government siding with the merchants, the charter of the company was dissolved."], [449, "BRITISH COMMERCE. IX The increased demand for cloth, which was stdl manufactured chiefly in the Nether lands, created a greater opening for English wool, and at an enhanced price; and the rage for sheep farming, which had given the main direction to industry, continued during the reign of Edward VI. as throughout that of his predecessor \u2014 but the result, though lucrative enough to landholders, was most injurious to rural labour. ments were founded on the coast of North America. They were first made in the hopes of finding gold ; and although this expecta tion was not realized, the intercourse between these settlements and the mother country tended greatly to increase the efficiency of the commercial marine, as well as to foster trade. The year 1651 saw the celebrated Act of Navigation, which was renewed by Charles II. Its objects were, first, to secure to Eng land and her colonies the exclusive import trade from Asia, Africa, and America, and, secondly, to allow to European nations no importation, except of their own products and in their own vessels. It was a fruit of the rising exertions of states to monopolize all commerce to themselves; but affected almost exclusively the Dutch, who then enjoyed nearly the whole of the carrying trade of Europe. In the reign of Elizabeth the trade of England received a great impulse, owing to the influx of numerous French and Flemish families, who fled before the religious perse cutions then carried on in their own lands. To these refugees the silk and woollen industries of the country were indebted for the many improvements then made in the processes of manufacture. And the great conflict between Spain and England, cul minating in the defeat of the Armada, by rousing the energies of the nation against the Catholic power, laid the foundation of England's future greatness by directing those energies to the attainment of rnari time superiority. In the seventeenth century several new manufactures were established in the sub ordinate branches of industry, as in iron, brass, silk, hats, glass, paper, &c., though the era of manufacturing prosperity was nearly a century later, when by mechanical discoveries the foundation was laid for the growth of the great staple manufactures in cotton, linen, and wool. The use of coal for fuel, and the establishment of the post office at this time, were two steps in an onward direction. The English, in the reign of Elizabeth, became active and successful competitors with the Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish in the great branches of general commerce. Having been trained by a long and con siderable traffic with their neighbours, they were naturally prepared for bolder specula tion and enterprise, and soon extended their projects to the most distant regions of the world. An endeavour to improve the roads of the country was made in 1663 by the erection of turnpikes, at which tolls were levied for the necessary repair of the thoroughfares. It does not appear that turnpike roads were generally available for travelling, or for the conveyance of merchandise, for nearly a hundred years after the above date; the communications being still in a very bad condition, and a great part of the internal trade was carried on with pack-horses. With the progress of this remote com merce the spirit of monopoly revived in England, and the principal branches of foreign trade were conferred on privileged companies. The old East India Company received its charter in this reign, in the year 1600. During this period, also, British settlc- b VOL. II."], [450, "BRITISH COMMERCE. X The trade of the country continued to increase, both during the reign of George II. and that of George III., up to the period of the American war. The years 1772-73 were marked by large commercial fadures caused by a long course of over-trading, the effect of which told upon exports for a considerable period. It was in the early part of the reign of George III. that James Watt inaugurated his wonderful improve ments in the application of steam-power; and shortly after we find James Hargreaves inventing the spinning-jenny, which was the first of a series of mechanical improve ments in the cotton manufacture. By these discoveries a great impulse was given to manufacturing operations, resulting in a vast augmentation of individual and national wealth, and the population at this period became much increased. On the restoration of Charles II., that monarch established a Council of Trade for keeping a control over the whole commerce ofthe nation; and he afterwards instituted a Board of Trade and Plantations, which was remodelled by William III. This board was abolished afterwards in 1782, and a new council for the affairs of trade was appointed. The following statement by Sir W. Petty, of the relative importance of the merchant shipping of the leading European states in 1690, shows to what a commercial position England had advanced by that time.

In 1699 the official value of imports into England was \u00a35,290,000 sterling, and of exports from England \u00a35,667,000. A table will be found on page 12 giving the amount of trade in decennial periods from this date. The export trade of the country was sensibly affected by the American war, but on the restoration of peace commerce revived with increased energy. A treaty of commerce with France was concluded in 1787; but though productive of much good on both sides, it was doomed to but a brief existence. An allusion has been made above to the attempt to improve the highways of the country, with a view of facilitating the transport of goods and passengers. The next step in the way of improved communi cation occurred in the eighteenth century, when the construction of canals commenced on a large scale, proving of great public utility, as well as a source of wealth to their proprietors. In the reign of George I. acts were passed for abolishing the export duties on most articles of native produce, with the exception of alum, coals, lead, and tin; and several raw materials used in dyeing were admitted free of duty. In the year 1720 the memorable South Sea Scheme diverted the nation from the sober pursuits of industry to projects of an imaginary description. Thus came the first of those monetary crises, which subsequent events show to be of almost periodical occurrence, but which, however disastrous in their consequences, never impose any lasting check on speculative avidity. The vast territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, and the commencement of a better system of colonial government, not only afforded a wide field for adventurous individuals, but threw open many new and extensive markets for British products."], [451, "BRITISH COMMERCE, XI In the year 1793 began the long series of wars with Napoleon and his allies, which, with the short interval of peace after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, continued until the final overthrow of Napoleon at Waterloo, in 1815. processes of the country, and the general prosperity that had been enjoyed by several branches of industry during the war, many of the legitimate sources of wealth were paralyzed. There came, in consequence, a general derangement in commercial affairs, and trade remained in a stationary position for many years. This unprosperous state of business was followed by a great mercantile crisis, in 1825\u201426, giving a severe shock to commercial progress, and long weighing upon the energies and industry of the country. During the greater part of these wars the progress of commerce was much retarded. The celebrated decrees of Berlin and Milan, intended by Napoleon to prohibit all deal ings between England and the Continent, and thus destroy her trade and the source from wdiich he imagined she procured the means of carrying on the war, did not effectually answer their desired end. The system of a continental blockade was found to be impracticable. Nevertheless, the diffi culties placed in the way of transport, the consequent risks involved, and the closing of the ports of the United States at that time to English goods, greatly limited the markets for the disposal of British manufactures; and a general rise of prices was the consequence. On the other hand, during the continuance of the war a large demand for stores and clothing was created ; but this demand, as is usuady the case, gave rise to great speculation, and many of the ordinary branches of trade were neglected in order to prosecute those exceptional ones called forth by the war. The return of peace brought these speculations to a close, but opened the way for others more dis astrous. On the fall of the French emperor the markets abroad were glutted with Eng lish goods, which, it is stated, were sold on terms so low as scarcely to defray insurance and shipping charges. In Holland the markets had been so overstocked that Eng lish manufactures were actually cheaper there than in England. Notwithstanding so many drawbacks to prosperity, the fruits of the advancement in education, which had marked the early part of the century, began to appear. In Eng land and Wales the number of scholars in day schools had increased from 674,833 in 1818, to 1,276,947 in 1833; and in Sunday schools, from 477,225 to 1,548,890.

The introduction of railroads and of steam vessels supplied this want, and, moreover, directed the attention of manu facturers and merchants to those artificial barriers which had been erected by the governments of past ages, both at home and abroad, in the form of duties and restrictions upon the exchange of national productions. had become a matter of necessity, both for the purpose of improving the revenue and developing the industry of the country ; but it was not until the year 1842 that any decided measures were taken in this direc tion. In that year it was announced in the speech from the throne at the opening of Parliament, that measures affecting the com merce and corn laws of the country would be brought forward for consideration. These measures constituted the first steps in the new commercial system of England, and will, with the subsequent acts of the legislature in the same direction, be noticed more fully hereafter. Their eyes being thus opened, the manu facturers began to petition the legislature to amend the laws which imposed such restrictions in this country; but nothing worthy of remark appears to have been done in this direction until the year 1822, at which date a series of fiscal reforms were commenced, which, though of no great importance, were still steps in advance. But the time had not yet arrived for any decided measures of commercial reform, nor was any ministry of that day strong enough to undertake them. In the nine years suc ceeding 1826 a revival of trade occurred, and the declared value of British exports increased from thirty-one and a half millions to fifty-three millions. But at the end of that time, in 1836, trade was pushed to its maximum limit, and great speculation, both in imports and exports, led again to com mercial failures and consequent commercial depression.

In attempting to trace the early growth of our free-trade policy, it will suffice for our present purpose to draw attention to the leading public acts that bear more immedi ately upon the subject. The defects of the mercantile system were ably pointed out by many contemporary writers, but by none were its fallacies more completely exposed than by Adam Smith in his \" Wealth of Nations.\" The fodowing passage from that work shows in the clearest manner how completely his mind had grasped the whole question. In summing up his remarks on the subject, he says that \" con sumption is the sole end and purpose of production, and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly self evident, that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it. But in the mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object of industry and commerce.\" the good seed sown by that great political economist would fail to take root in the public mind. The country was then at war; and although it cannot be said that battles are always unfavourable to books, it is certain that the time when we are fighting our neighbours is not that in which we are most likely to reform ourselves. But no sooner did peace return, and the inhabitants of the country resume their wonted avoca tions, than indications of a sounder know ledge of commercial legislation became apparent. Within sive years ofthe termina tion of the great European wars we find (in 1820) a committee of the leading merchants of London petitioning Parlia ment in the following terms : \u2014 \" That foreign commerce is eminently conducive to the wealth and prosperity of the country, by enabling it to import the commodities for the production of which the soil, climate, capital, and industry of other countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which its own situation is better adapted. \" That freedom from restraint is calculated to give the utmost extension to foreign trade, and the best direction to the capital and industry of the country. In short, while the mercantile system provided for the benefit of the few, i.e., the producers or manufacturers, the free-trade policy provides for the benefit of the many, i.e., the consumers, including, of course, the producers in that capacity. \" That the maxim of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest, which regulates every merchant in his individual dealings, is strictly applicable as the best rule for the trade of the whole nation. Between the days of Adam Smith and the introduction of free trade were many eventful years; but it was not likely that"], [454, "BRITISH COMMERCE. XIV \" That a policy founded on those principles would render the commerce of the world an interchange of mutual advantages, and diffuse and increase wealth and enjoyments among the inhabitants of each state. few are of any ultimate benefit to the classes in whose favour they were originally insti tuted, and none to the extent of the loss occasioned by them to other classes. \" That, among the other evils of the restrictive or protective system, not the least is, that the artificial protection of one branch of industry or source of production against foreign competition, is set up as a ground of claim by other branches for similar protection; so that if the reasoning upon which restrictive or prohibitory regu lations are founded were followed out consistently, it would not stop short of excluding us from all foreign commerce whatsoever; and the same train of argument, which, with corresponding prohibitions and protective duties, should exclude us from foreign trade, might be brought forward to justify the re-enactment of restrictions upon the interchange of productions (unconnected with public revenue) among the kingdoms composing the Union, or among the counties of the same kingdom. \" That, unfortunately, a policy the very reverse of this has been, and is, more or less, adopted and acted upon by the govern ment of this and of every other country, each trying to exclude the productions of other countries, with the specious and well meant design of encouraging its own pro ductions ; thus inflicting on the bulk of its subjects, who are consumers, the necessity of submitting to privations in the quantity or quality of commodities ; and thus render ing what ought to be the source of mutual benefit and of harmony among states, a constantly recurring occasion of jealousy and hostility. \" That the prevailing prejudices in savour of the protective or restrictive system may be traced to the erroneous supposition that every importation of foreign commodities occasions a diminution or discouragement of our own productions to the same extent : whereas it may be clearly shown, that although the particular description of pro duction which could not stand against unrestrained foreign competition would be discouraged, yet as no importation could be continued for any length of time without a corresponding exportation, direct or in direct, there would be an encouragement, for the purpose of that exportation, of some other production to which our situation might be better suited; thus affording at least an equal, and probably a greater, and certainly a more beneficial employment, to our own capital and labour. \" That an investigation of the effects of the restrictive system, at this time, is peculiarly called for, as it may, in the opinion of the petitioners, lead to a strong presumption that the distress which now so generally prevails is considerably aggravated by the system ; and that some relief may be obtained by the earliest practicable removal of such of the restraints as may be shown to be most injurious to the capital and industry of the community, and to be attended with no compensating benefit to the public revenue. \" That a declaration against the anti commercial principles of our restrictive system is of the more importance at the present juncture, inasmuch as in several instances of recent occurrence, the merchants and manufacturers in foreign states have assailed their respective governments with \" That of the numerous protective and prohibitory duties of our commercial code, it may be proved that, while all operate as a heavy tax on the community at large, very"], [455, "BRITISH COMMERCE XV applications for further protection or pro hibitory duties and regulations, urging the authority and example of this country, against which they are almost exclusively directed, as a sanction for the policy of such measures. And certainly, if the reasoning upon which our restrictions have been defended is worth anything, it will apply in behalf of the regulations of foreign states against us. They insist upon our superiority in capital and machinery, as we do upon their comparative exemption from taxation, and with equal foundation. \" That in thus declaring, as your peti tioners do, their conviction of the impolicy and injustice of the restrictive system, and in desiring every practicable relaxation of it, they have in view only such parts of it as are not connected, or are only subordinately so, with the public revenue. As long as the necessity for the present amount of revenue subsists, your petitioners cannot expect so important a branch of it as the customs to be given up, nor to be materially diminished, unless some substitute, less objectionable, be suggested. But it is against every restrictive regulation of trade, not essential to the revenue, against all duties merely protective from foreign competition, and against the excess of such duties as are partly for the purpose of the revenue and partly for that of protection, that the prayer of the present petition is respectfully sub mitted to Parliament.\" \" That nothing would more tend to cotmteract the commercial hostility of foreign states than the adoption of a more enlight ened and more conediatory policy on the part of this country. \" That, although as a matter of mere diplomacy, it may sometimes answer to hold out the removal of particular prohibitions or high duties as depending upon corresponding concessions of other states in our favour, it does not follow that we should maintain our restrictions in cases where the desired con cessions on their part cannot be obtained. Our restrictions would not be less prejudicial to our own capital and industry because other governments persisted in preserving im politic regulations. This remarkable petition may be viewed as the call to arms, preparatory to the coming conflict between the interests of the manu facturers and producers, and those of the consumers or masses ofthe population. The philosophical writings of Adam Smith were not regarded by the monopolists with much apprehension, owing in some degree, per haps, to the condition of political affairs at the time of their issue ; but the petition of the London merchants, embodying the views of the most practical body of a most practical people, was naturally viewed with deep feelings of alarm by those interested in the maintenance of the commercial system of the day. \" That, upon the whole, the most liberal jsvould prove the most politic course on such occasions. \" That, independent of the direct benefit to be derived by this country on every occasion of such concession or relaxation, a great incidental object would be gained by the recognition of a sound principle or standard to which all subsequent arrange ments might be referred, and by the salu tary influence which a promulgation of such just views by the legislature, and by the nation at large, could not fail to have on the policy of other states. Although little immediate benefit resulted from this first attack upon the legislature, it soon became evident that the views held by the London merchants were, to a certain extent, becoming those of the Government. In 1822 Mr. Wallace, then president ofthe Board of Trade, introduced measures into"], [456, "BRITISH COMMERCE. XVI Parliament of a decided liberal tendency. Various obsolete statutes relating to com merce were repealed, and treaties of reci procity were established with most foreign nations, the object being to permit the importation and exportation of goods in foreign vessels on payment of the same duties as were chargeable when imported in British vessels, provided that such nations should not levy discriminating duties upon goods imported into those countries in British vessels; and further, to levy upon the vessels of such nations, when frequenting British ports, the same tonnage duties as were chargeable on British vessels. ment by which they were to be accom plished.\" During the ten years that elapsed between the settlement of the reform question in 1832, and the introduction of the first free trade measures of Sir R. Peel, many import ant changes in the customs tariff were effected by Mr. Poulet Thompson, afterwards Lord Sydenham. That gentleman, however, though fully comprehending and appre ciating the free-trade principle in all its bearings, was restrained from putting into practice what he clearly saw was for the commercial welfare of the nation, by the dissimilar views entertained by most of his colleagues, as well as by the majority ofthe members of both Houses of Parliament. In the year 1824 further modifications were introduced, consisting of a revision of the duties on silk; and the following year saw the removal of the prohibition placed upon the importation of foreign manufac tures, and an import duty of 30 per cent., ad valorem, established in its stead. It was also during this period that there arose a cause which, in its ultimate effects, perhaps more than any other, contributed to the introduction of a change in the commercial policy of the country. Owing to the restrictive duties imposed on the importations of food, the nation, in seasons of deficient harvests and other times of scarcity, was heavily taxed to procure food; and the dearness of bread proved a subject of great discontent among the labouring classes. The impolicy of the corn laws, and the strong conviction of the impover ishing effects of the landlords' monopoly, led at last to a combination on the part of the people, resulting eventually in the decisive legislation of 1846. Some years now elapsed without any further steps being made in the path of commercial reform; but reform of another kind, indirectly connected with commercial freedom, now came to pass, namely, the reform of the representation in 1832. The manufacturing and commercial classes, hav ing little confidence in the sympathy of the legislature as then constituted, expected much from its reformation, and struggled hard in many ways to attain their end. \" Free trade, peace, non-intervention, re trenchment, full religious liberty, abolition of slavery, wide constituencies, municipal elections, protection to the voter, parlia ments more frequently accountable to the people,\" were the objects sought to be attained. Such are the words of a leader in the Anti-Corn Law League, and the speaker added \u2014 \" These always kept in view, an earnest and effective effort was made for the Reform bill as the instru- Manchester, which had made such im mense strides in the perfection of the cotton manufacture, took the lead in that great popular movement which, in the course of a few years, forced upon the legislature the necessity of a fundamental change in the traditional policy of the nation. As in the case of the Reform bill, so in that of free trade, the desired results were only ob tained by unceasing external pressure upon"], [457, "BRITISH COMMERCE XVII Parliament. Few persons, possibly not even the projectors of the movement themselves, could have dared to hope for the results which followed the establishment of the Anti-Corn Law Association in 1838. Ori ginally projected by a small body of earnest men in Manchester, its ranks gradually swelled until it became the famous \" League,\" with members in almost every town in the kingdom, having all banded together for a common cause, the abolition of the corn laws. By lectures, by pamphlets, by advo cates in Parliament, and by every possible form of discussion, the Anti-Corn Law League succeeded in thoroughly arousing the attention of the country; and though aiming chiefly at the destruction of the corn laws, it completed the exposure of the fal lacious principles upon which the entire commerce of the country was conducted, and thus became another pioneer of Free Trade. standing many shortcomings, however, the measures introduced in the year 1842 must be regarded as the foundation upon which the new commercial system was to rest. It is true that as regarded the duties on corn, Sir Robert Peel's proposal, which was merely for some modifications in the application of the \" sliding scale,\" by reducing the maxi mum of the duty instead of abolishing it altogether, fell short of the desires of the League. But it was fortunate for the country that it did so, or the subsequent important part taken by the League in holding the legislature to the line of policy thus intro duced would have been lost to the nation. On the other hand, the revision of the customs tariff was accepted with gratification by the great body of enlightened manufac turers, not, indeed, as a final measure, but as the turning point in the history of their fortunes. The broad principles laid down by Sir Robert Peel in proposing the changes in the tariff were \u2014 the abolition of all imposts which tended to check trade without bene fiting the revenue, and the reduction or repeal of all duties on raw materials em ployed in manufactures or as necessaries of life. Irrespective of the advantages to be derived from the adoption of such changes, the establishment of a fixed principle of taxation was of the utmost value to the mercantile and commercial classes generally. Beyond the reduction of duty on several articles, including those of food, and the permission to import sheep, cattle, and fresh beef and pork, which had hitherto been prohibited, there was no grand change or simplification of the tariff. It is difficult at the present moment to appreciate the changes then made. But of one fact they were a clear indication, and that was the most important fact of all \u2014 the renunciation of the former system of protection. Many seasons of deep distress, consequent upon the condition ofthe national industries, occurred during this period. Almost every branch of trade was depressed. Bad har vests, bankruptcies, want of employment, low wages, starvation, and an annually decreasing revenue, ominously pointed to the unsatisfactory condition of the country. Such signs were not to be mistaken, and the legislature, listening at last to the warn ing voice of the country, instituted inquiries into the evds which it was the mission of the League to unfold. But though several attempts were made in Parliament to deal with the difficulties that arose, it was not until the year 1842 that a minister of sufficient boldness was found to undertake the task of remodelling the commercial system of the country; and even Sir Robert Peel, in his first efforts, could not be persuaded to forsake entirely the old paths of protection. Notwith- c VOL. II."], [458, "BRITISH COMMERCE XVIII A breach in the wall once made, stone after stone came away. But Parliament turned very reluctantly from its old ways. It could with difficulty be persuaded to give up the habit of fostering privileged classes and occupations, and was either unable or unwilling to consider trade from a con sumer's point of view. To what extent this feeling was shared, even by Sir Robert Peel, may be inferred from a reply made in 1844 to a resolution in the House of Com mons, expressing an opinion that England ought not to postpone the remission of her import duties with a view to negotiations for reciprocity. Upon that occasion Sir Robert stated that the government had reserved many articles from immediate re duction, in the hope that ere long they might attain that which they considered just and beneficial to all, namely, increased facilities for British exports in return. \" At the same time,\" he remarked, \" I am bound to say that it is for our interest to buy cheap, whether other countries will buy cheap or no. We have a right to exhaust all means to induce them to do justice; but if they per severe in refusing, the penalty is on us if we do not buy in the cheapest market. I feel certain that the example of England, adopted at a time of commercial and financial difficulty \u2014 our determination to pursue our path in the right course \u2014 will operate on foreign nations; but if we find that our example is not followed, if we find that instead of reducing the duties on our manu factures they resort to the impolicy of increasing them, still this ought not, in my opinion, to operate as a discouragement to us to act on those principles which we believe to be sound, those principles which will not only be immediately profitable to us, but the example of which will ultimately insure the general application of them, which will confer reciprocal benefit on ourselves and on all those who are wise enough to follow it.\" Here there are indications of a perfect knowledge of what was the right course to be taken, but at the same time signs of considerable timidity in venturing to pursue it. The interval between the tariff reductions, in 1842 and 1845, was filled up with stormy debates both in and out of Parliament, on the subject of further progress; and within this period another cause arose to urge the unwilling ministry along the new path they had dared to tread. In the midst of so many other troubles suddenly came the disease in the potato, which was the cause of great distress, especially in Ireland; and it became necessary for the government to take measures to relieve the sufferings of a starving population. So great, however, was the disinclination of some of the minis ters then in power to make any further concessions on the corn duties, that the cabinet tendered its resignation, and was subsequently, after the failure of the Whig party to form a government, succeeded by a new ministry under the direction of Sir Robert Peel. The partial success which attended the labours of the Corn Law League in 1842, induced them at this period to redouble their efforts to obtain an entire abolition of the duty on corn, and during the three following years its members availed them selves of every means to accomplish their purpose. Dunkley, in his history of Free Trade, says that \"the attitude of the Anti-Corn Law League at this moment was more menacing than it had been at any former period ; and its menace was of just such a character as the minister could most fully appreciate, one of calm, self-conscious, moral power. Its pacific resolves, studiously con fined within the spirit, as well as the letter"], [459, "BRITISH COMMERCE XIX of the laws, and backed by the growino- enthusiasm and unanimity of the people, were more terrific to justice than a million of armed men. With inimitable tact and heroic patience, the free traders determined to fight the battle out by the slow but sure methods provided by the Constitution. They had wealth enough for any purpose; the Constitution recognized wealth as a valid title to political power; they would therefore purchase freeholds, and master the county constituencies. In 1844 they had raised \u00a3100,000 for carrying on the agitation, and at the moment when Sir Robert Peel resumed office, a fund of a quarter of a mfllion was in progress, towards which \u00a360,000 were contributed at a single meet- ing in Manchester. Whde the lapse of time seemed to recruit rather than to exhaust the financial power of the League, it also multiplied its weapons in the sphere of logic. Unanswerable experiments had now proved the expediency of free trade. As far as it had been tried, its result had undeniably been to extend our commerce and promote the general interests of the country. We see here the true, and at the same time the most legitimate source, to which the altered measures of government may be ascribed. Referring to the Irish famine, Sir Robert Peel said, \" I will not giVe to that cause too much weight, I will not withhold the homage which is due to reason and truth, by denying that my opinions on the subject of protection have undergone a change. My opinions have been modified by the experience of the last three years. I have had an opportunity of comparing the results of the principle which has been followed during those years, namely, the gradual removal of protection from domestic industry. I have had an opportunity of comparing periods of abun dance and comparatively low prices, with periods of scarcity and high prices, and I am led to the conclusion that the grounds of public policy on which protection has been defended are not tenable; at least I cannot defend them.\" The close of the address from which this passage is taken, presents us with a noble instance of inde pendence in a statesman, and was peculiarly appropriate to the circumstances which then surrounded the illustrious convert to free trade: \u2014 \" Wide honour and a sense of public duty require it, I do not shrink from office. I am ready to incur its responsi bilities, to bear its sacrifices, to confront its honourable perils; but I wdl not maintain it with limited power and shackled author ity. I will not stand at the helm during the tempestuous night, if that helm is not allowed freely to traverse. I will not undertake to direct the course of the vessel by observations taken in 1842.\" Having thus stated his conviction in the soundness of free-trade principles, Sir Robert Peel declared at the opening of Parliament in 1846, that he wished to extend them to all branches of commerce; and with this view he proposed, in carrying out further modifications in the tariff, to admit pro visions of all kinds free. As regarded corn, he proposed to subject it to a low sliding scale for three years, and afterwards to admit it at a nominal rate of duty. On manufactures he proposed to reduce the duties by one-half, with the exception of the coarser kinds, which were to be admitted duty free. On the passing of this measure the labours of the Corn Law League were at an end; but the part they took in forcing the attention of the legislature to the unsoundness and injustice of the old pro tective policy can never be forgotten; and it is not too much to affirm that the great changes brought about by Sir Robert Peel"], [460, "BRITISH COMMERCE XX were mainly owing to the unceasing efforts ofthe League. As regards corn, the duty was, in 1869, entirely abolished. The measures above alluded to were the last effected by Sir Robert Peel; but so firmly had the principle of free trade taken root in the nation, that the course of future ministries was confined to following in the same direction. Famine still remained in the land, and the Whig ministry that suc ceeded Sir Robert Peel proposed a short suspension of the corn and navigation laws as a means of alleviating the national calamity. The suspension of these enact ments gave the free-trade party an oppor tunity for obtaining a committee upon the subject; the result was their final repeal in 1849. With the abolition of the navigation laws protection may be said to have been driven from the land. In 1853 a further simplification of the tariff was made, and many articles still slightly taxed were made free of duty. Subsequent legislation was chiefly directed to the regulation of the duties on those articles on which imposts are still levied for fiscal purposes, with the exception of the alterations effected in the year 1860, in connection with the treaty of commerce with France. In that year, besides reducing the duties on wine, the govern ment abolished all the remaining imposts on articles of clothing, on machinery, on hard ware, on silks, and on many miscellaneous articles; and in 1865 the timber duties were also swept away, in connection with the treaty of commerce between England and Austria. Intimately connected with the free-trade reforms carried on during the period under review, may be mentioned the repeal of the excise duties on bricks, glass, soap, paper, and hops \u2014 remissions which have immensely contributed to the comfort and welfare of the people. The institution of the penny post, and the abolition of the stamp duty on newspapers, taken in connection with the repeal of the paper duty, were fitting accom paniments to the enlightened policy of free trade. In concurrence with, and even in advance of, the work of legislation, the activity ofthe scientific and industrious classes ofthe people contributed in no small degree to render the continuation of the protective system a matter of difficulty. The discovery of the motive power of steam, and its applica tion to purposes of locomotion by land and by sea, as well as to manufacturing processes, must be considered greatly instrumental in effecting the change which has been made in the commercial policy of the country. By means of this mighty agent the power of production and distribution is so rapidly augmented, that the old methods of trade have become incompatible with its extended use; and the scientific discoveries that were made towards perfecting the various manu facturing processes of the country, added to an increased degree of education among the working classes, has given an impetus to enlightened legislation in accordance with the spirit of the age. The throwing open of the coasting trade of the country in 1854 completed the system of free navigation in the kingdom. It is obvious, however, that the commerce of this country could never have attained its actual enormous development, unless to the greatest conceivable enterprise on the part of merchants had been added the most liberal disposition on the part of the crown to give every possible facility foi the rapid The British tariff, as it now stands, is therefore brought within a very limited compass, and the customs revenue is now almost entirely derived from duties on sugar, tea, spirits, wine, tobacco, and coffee."], [461, "BRITISH COMMERCE.

The general conclusions which may be drawn from these figures are : that during seven and twenty years of protection the value of imports increased only by thirty five millions sterling, against one hundred and eight millions during three and twenty years of a liberal commercial policy ; during the same time the total exports advanced only sixty -three millions in the former period, whilst they rose to two hundred and twenty- three millions in the latter. The values just quoted are those termed \" official,\" and must be taken rather as a measure of quantity than of value. As regards the produce of the kingdom ex ported, a \" real \" valuation has existed throughout both periods, obtained from the declarations of exporting merchants ; and the figures in the third column of the above table, derived from this source, indicate in a still more striking manner than those in the two preceding columns the extraordi nary progress of trade under the new com mercial system. We now proceed to notice separately the effects of the new commercial system upon the two branches of the commerce and in dustry of the country. Firstly, that of the external trade, which consists in the ex change of national and other products with foreign states, and with the colonial posses sions ofthe kingdom. The prejudicial action of the protective system upon the foreign trade of the country has already been pointed out, and it remains but to indicate the opposite effects of the system of free exchange. But before entering into this part of the subject the reader may be assisted in apjDre ciating the importance of the change that has taken place, by a view of the com mercial transactions of the kingdom under the respective systems of protection and free trade as presented to our notice by the official statistics, and shown in a condensed form in the following tables : \u2014 It will be seen that, during seven and twenty years of protection, from 1815 to 1842, notwithstanding the great advantages enjoyed by producers in the shape of numer ous discoveries ; in the application of steam as a motive power for factory purposes ; of superior processes in manipulating and finishing manufactures ; of discoveries in chemistry as bearing upon dyeing and Average of Total Imports.

Indeed, if allow ance were made for the fall in prices in goods, resulting partly from the improve ments in manufacture and partly from a decline in the cost of the raw materials, a decline rather than an advance would mark the transactions of the period. This fact is more clearly shown as regards exports by the proportion per head of population having declined from an aver age of \u00a32 6s. in the three years 1815\u2014 16\u201417 to \u00a31 17s. in the three years 1840-41-42. The results of the second period, from 1843 to 1866, are very different in all branches of trade. The \" official\" value of imports increased by one hundred and eight millions; that of the exports by two hundred and twenty-three millions; and the \"real\" value of British exports alone by one hundred and fourteen millions. In the year 1854 a new system of ascer taining the value of imports and of foreign and colonial exports was introduced; and from that date, although but about the middle of the period in which free trade has been in operation in this country, we are able to arrive at a more correct view of the extent of the commercial dealings of the kingdom with foreign states. The subjoined table for the period from 1854 to 1866 illustrates the progress of the foreign trade of the country in all its branches. The total values are given in millions of pounds sterling : \u2014 REAL VALUE OF THE TOTAL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF MERCHANDISE INTO AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM, WITH PROPORTION THEREOF PER HEAD OF THE POPULATION. The amount of progress indicated by the above table is sufficient of itself to prove the soundness of the free-trade policy; but striking as the progress has been, it would have appeared still greater had the means existed for instituting a comparison of the several branches of the foreign trade of the country for the years preceding 1854. In the single instance of the value of the native productions and manufactures exported from the kingdom are we able to show the pro gress made since 1842. The average value of British exports in the three years 1840 1-2 was fifty millions sterling, or \u00a3l 17s. per head of the population.

Commercial crises, wars, short harvests, and speculative manias, are still recurring contingencies; but the country has borne up against them far more successfully under free trade than she did under protection. After making allowance for all accidental circumstances, however, it is shown by the foregoing facts that while under the old restrictive commercial policy, which was in force from 1815 to 1842, little or no progress was made in extending the sale of British produce abroad, the free-trade policy, which has regulated the commercial transactions of the country since 1842, has caused this important branch of trade to increase by more than two hundred per cent. The value of British exports was un doubtedly to a great extent augmented in 1816 and 1817 by the return of peace, which caused an extensive export to all the conti nental markets, to such an extent, indeed, that a disastrous panic ensued from the over trading of those years. But, on the other hand, it could scarcely have been expected that so little progress as is here indicated should have taken place during more than twenty years of peace up to 1842. With such evidence before us it is not difficult to perceive that the half measures which were adopted by various successive ministers, up to the time of Sir Robert Peel's admin istration, were powerless to effect any great amelioration in the condition of either manufacturers or operatives. Trade flagged, and oscillated between advancement and retrogression, but never substantially improved. Another proof of the vast expansion of the foreign and colonial trade ofthe country, may be found in the returns of the ship ping employed in transporting merchandise from and to our shores. The subjoined table gives the total tonnage thus employed prior and subsequent to the year 1842: \u2014 No sooner, however, had the commercial policy of the country been changed than a new life was infused into all branches of production. Factories increased ; old mills were restored and set in operation; manu facturers realized a profit; and operatives gained better wages and more steady em ployment. Instead of a decline, there was an annual increase in the exports of the native productions of the kingdom ; and these results were gained through a series of bad as well as of good seasons : for it must not be forgotten that the diseases of commerce, if they may be so termed, have A recent parliamentary return of the gross amount of property and profits assessed to property and income tax also exhibits in a striking manner the development of the resources of Great Britain under the free trade policy.

But to return to the statistics of the external trade of the kingdom, what has been the development of the two branches of the foreign trade since 1842 ? We have seen that up to that date this all-import ant source of wealth was steadily though gradually disappearing, and that its decline was viewed with great concern by the pro ducers and manufacturers of the country; that up to that date legislation had not only proved ineffectual to bring about an improvement in the condition of the oper ative classes, but had, on the contrary, reduced them to a most pitiable state. We have now to look on a brighter picture, as portrayed in the following facts: \u2014 The total value of British produce ex ported in 1842 and 1866 to foreign countries and to British colonies, was as follows : \u2014 To Foreign To British Countries.

As the means of obtaining the value of imports for the period from 1842 to 1866 do not exist, we must, in default, have recourse to the value of exports, in order to form an indicator which will mark the effect of repealing import duties upon the development of national industries; and in this manner we find that each reduction of the import tariff was almost immediately followed by an increased amount of British exports. The declared value of British exports in each year from 1840 to 1866, was as follows : \u2014 Value in Years. millions of rounds Sterling. 1840, 51,000,000 1841, 51,000,000 1842, 47,000,000 1843, 52,000,000 1844, ... . 68,000,000 1845, 60,000,000 1846, 58,000,000* 1847 59,000,000* 1848, 53,000,000* 1849, 63,000,000 1850, 71,000,000 1851, 74,000,000 1852, 78,000,000 1853 99,000,000 1854, 97,000,000s 1855 95,000,000s 1856 116,000,000 1857, 122,000,000 1858, 116,000,000-t 1859, 130,000,000 1860 136,000,000 186l' 125,000,000\u00a7 1862, 124,000,000\u00a7 1863, 146,000,000 1864 160,000,000 1865^ 166,000,000 1866, 189,000,000 * Years of potato famine and Chartist revolutionary move- ment. f Russian war.

The development of the export trade has, indeed, far exceeded the expectations of the most enthusiastic of the early adherents to the free-trade policy. To those who twenty years ago watched the gradual improvement of the trade of the country, as it became lightened of its burdens and restrictions, an annual increase of a few millions sterling was a source of the greatest satisfaction ; but the idea of our exports trebling in amount in so short a time could scarcely have entered into their calculations. It was generally believed, when our exports had reached the enormous sum of one hundred millions sterling, that the country had arrived at the extreme limit of production; and yet year after year that amount has been annually exceeded, until, in the year 1866, it attained the sum of one hundred and eighty-nine millions. In the face of the general expansion of commerce in Europe, owing to the spread of free trade among our neighbours, it is impossible to assign a limit to the extent of our dealings with other countries. The probability is, that having exchanged so largely with them under protection, we shall continue to do so to a still greater degree as the obstacles in our way are removed.

Throughout the whole of the above period the United States has been our best customer, having increased its custom from no less than seven to twenty-eight millions sterling since 1841. The exports to the Hanse Towns stand next in importance, but do not show so large an increase. The extension of our exports to France is owing to the operation of the treaty of commerce negotiated in 1860. The most superficial glance at the above table will afford an idea of the vastly extended trade of this country with almost every nation of the world. It is true that towards the close of the period under review, a great part of the increase of trade between this country and many of the European states is owing to those states having recognized and adopted a more liberal system of commercial policy; but as the steps which they have taken in the path of progress can be ascribed only to our example, the extended dealings with the countries in question may be fairly included among the results of the free-trade policy of Great Britain.

The trade with California has been stated in connection with that ofthe United States. The dimensions which our commerce with all these states has attained, is due to the vast proportions in which their native products are consumed in this kingdom, owing to the policy which permits, with very few exceptions, their free importation. DECLARED VALUE OF BRITISH EXPORTS TO PRINCIPAL BRITISH COLONIES. \" A nation of manufacturers,\" as Mr. Dunkley observes in his work already re ferred to, \"can only subsist as they sell their produce, and they can sell their pro duce only as they sell it cheap. But the ability to sell their produce cheaply implies a cheap command of the raw material and of the workman's food.\" * Included with China \u2014 see Former Table. With such convincing proofs before us, it is impossible not to acknowledge that the free-trade system has fully answered all the ends it proposed, and that its adoption has conferred an amount of prosperity upon this country altogether without a parallel in its history. That both of these ends have been ac complished may be inferred from the facts already cited, relating to the expansion of the export trade of the country; but it may be interesting to show how the result has been brought about. The figures for single years wotdd not, as a general rule, be the most accurate standards for comparison, but those which we have selected, belonging as they do to a period of continual advancement, may be considered sufficiently indicative of the suc cess that has attended the repeal of import duties upon the articles under consideration. In addition to the rapid growth of our Australian colonies, the discovery of gold in California and the opening of Chinese and Japanese ports to English ships have been the means of extending our commerce in the basin ofthe Pacific Ocean ; and besides furnishing new markets, have led to an extension of our trade with the old. The following are the quantities of articles of food, &c, and of raw materials of manu facture, imported into the United Kingdom in each ofthe years 1842 and 1866 : \u2014 In 1842 China, including Hong-Kong, took less than one mdlion sterling in the shape of British produce from Great Britain. In 1866 Great Britain exported more than seven millions' worth of goods to China. In 1842 our trade with Japan was simply nil; in 1866 it was valued at nearly one million and a half sterling.

The production of flax and wool has undoubtedly increased to a great extent. The second question may be easily answered. We find that the total popula tion of the kingdom in 1842 was twenty seven millions, and in 1866 nearly thirty millions, showing an increase of only eleven per cent. \u2014 an increase bearing no propor tion to that of the quantities of food, &c, imported during the period. Let us take, for example, the imports of com and flour as shown below : \u2014 imports OF food, &C.\u2014 continued. IMPORTS OF RAW MATERIALS. It is clear from these facts that the in creased consumption of foreign corn and grain was out of all proportion to the increase in the population. We must therefore turn to the third question, and ascertain whether the increased importations are not due to the improved condition of the population. That such is the fact we have abundant proofs, but a few will suffice for the present purpose. Among the main signs of a people's pros perity must be counted the consumption of articles which, if not luxuries, are some thing beyond the necessaries of life. In 1841 the average consumption of tea per head of the population was only one and a half lb. ; in 1866 it reached three and a half lbs. In 1841 the average consumption of sugar was seventeen lbs. per head; in 1866 it increased to thirty-eight and a half lbs. per head. The total amount received, paid, and On comparing the importations of the two years above given, it becomes evident that some great change in the condition of the country must have taken place during the interval. With regard to the nature of the change, three questions will naturally arise. 1st. Did the country cease to produce the articles quoted? 2nd. Did the population rapidly increase ? 3rd. Was the condition of the population very sensibly improved ? With regard to the first question we have no data, as far as farm produce is concerned, from which to form a conclusion.

The two conditions neces sary to the success of English manufacturers, namely, cheap raw materials for manufac ture, and cheap food for operatives, are both secured to their fullest extent by the free-trade policy; and the consequence is that we have been able to set all rivalry at defiance. The question, however, now arises, After having secured employment to the manufac turers, and consequently to the operatives, has free trade had any effect in extending the sale of the increased produce of the country? or in other words, has it enabled the British producer to compete more sue- 1866: \u2014 * Including post-office savings banks.

That operatives and manufacturers have both benefited incalculably by free trade is \u2022beyond a doubt. But there is another point connected with the abolition of the import duties which deserves notice. It was ad- mitted, even by the supporters of monopoly, that a cheap supply of raw materials was wanted for the welfare of the manufacturing industry of the country. Their objection was to the policy of admitting foreign manufactured goods to compete with Eng- lish goods in English markets. To what extent the foreigner has been able to com- pete in the English markets under free trade, will be seen by the following table of the 1S41. 1866.\" imount received, . imount paid, Capital, \u00a3 5,694,000 5,487,000 24,474,000 \u00a3 11,794,000 13,627,000 44,503,000"], [470, "BRITISH COMMERCE XXX cessfully with his foreign rivals in their own markets? This question has already been answered in the tables relative to the con dition of our export trade during the two periods from 1815 to 1842, and from 1843 to 1866. While our export trade made no progress under the first period \u2014 when pro tective duties on imports were levied \u2014 it increased by two hundred per cent, during the second period, under free importation. declared VALUE \u2014 continued. It is not difficult to explain how this great change has come to pass, since it is evident that the large supplies of food and raw mate rial imported into the country must be paid for in one shape or another. By increasing importations, therefore, exportations are aug mented, and a double profit secured to the country. The increased exchange between England and foreign states since 1860, is due in part to the steps taken by France, and subsequently by other continental states, towards a liberal policy ; thus enabling mer chants and manufacturers to extend their dealings. A reference to these changes will be made hereafter. Besides the above, many new branches of trade have been created, making a total value of \u00a3188,913,000 exported in 1866, against \u00a347,000,000 exported in 1842. Extension of indirect commerce has also resulted from the abolition of duties on imported articles. Owing to the peculiar geographical situation of England, and to the extensive means of communication she possesses with every part of the world, she is eminently fitted to form a general store house from which other nations not possess ing the same advantages might draw supplies. Under a system of protective duties and vexatious restrictions it was impossible to carry on this branch of trade to any great extent; but when the operations of merchants were unfettered a vast extension took place. The real value of foreign and colonial mer chandise exported from the United Kingdom to foreign countries was not ascertained until the year 1854, but the progress made since that time will sufficiently show the import ance of this trade, and the rapidity of its Some idea of the extent of the develop ment which the principal branches of native industry have made under free trade, may be formed from the following comparison of the value of the principal articles of native production exported in the years 1842 and 1866:\u2014 DECLARED VALUE. growth : \u2014 Real Value of Foreign and Colonial Merchandise Exported. 1854> 18,636,366 186e. 49,988,146 In 1865 it was even still higher than in 1866, amounting to \u00a352,995,851. 1842. 186G. \".inen yarn, 11 Manufactures, Machinery, Metals : Iron and steel, \" Copper and brass, \" Lead, \" Tin and tin plates, *)il, seed, 'aper (except hangings), .

BRITISH TONNAGE ENTERED AND CLEARED WITH CARGOES ONLY. The above shows an increased employment to the extent of over thirteen million tons in 1866, as compared with that engaged in 1842. This vast increase is due to the amount of steam tonnage which has been added to the commercial marine during the past five and twenty years, the employment of which affords so much assistance to merchants in the speedy and reliable delivery of their goods in foreign ports. In connection with this extension of trade, we must not omit to notice the effect of the repeal of the navigation laws upon the pros perity of that important class of the popu lation which is engaged in bringing to our shores the supplies of food and raw material necessary for the comfort and welfare of the people, and in conveying the finished pro ducts of our industry to other countries. The amount of steam tonnage belonging to the kingdom in 1842 was 108,000 tons, as compared with 875,000 tons in the year 1866. As in all similar instances, the predicted ruin of the shipping interests upon the withdrawal of protection has not been veri fied, as will be sufficiently apparent by the fodowing facts: \u2014 A system of unrestricted intercourse without cheap means of communication would be but of little avail. By a happy accident, concurrently with the birth of the new policy, came the introduction of steam communication upon land and water, giving free scope to the aroused energies of the nation. By the introduction of this means of transit every place obtained a wider market for its productions, and a wider field whence to draw its supplies. The change also effected a considerable saving in the expense of conveying both goods and persons, the difference being of course available for employment in other ways. TONNAGE OF VESSELS BRITISH-BUILT AND REGISTERED IX THE UNITED KINGDOM. It is evident from the above figures that English ships have found better employment under free trade than under protection, or the shipbuilding trade would have exhibited a decline instead of a steady increase; but a further proof of this is afforded by the amount of tonnage employed in the foreign trade of the country : \u2014 In 1845 the total number of miles of railway open for traffic was 2264; in 1865 there were 13,289 miles in operation. The total amount of capital paid up for railways in the United Kingdom, inclusive of loans, &c, to the end of 1865, amounted to no less a sum than \u00a3455,478,000 sterling. Such 1842. 1866.

The older means of internal communica tion, such as the canal and coasting trade traffic, have not been displaced by the modern iron-way, but, on the contrary, have greatly benefited by the increased com mercial activity of the country. The establishment of the penny postage in 1840, supplemented, too, in recent years by the electric telegraph, was an appropriate forerunner ofthe institution of free exchange. On the introduction ofthe measure in 1840 the number of chargeable letters increased from seventy-six millions to one hundred and sixty-nine millions. In 1865 the number of letters delivered by the post office reached the sum of no less than seven hundred and twenty millions. A very important question still remains to be answered. At what cost to the revenue has this wonderful expansion of trade been made? The following table will perhaps best answer the question : \u2014 * War taxes imposed on tea and sugar.

It remains now to notice the effect of free exchange upon the domestic industries of the country. upon the superior force possessed by the country, in the shape of the then newly invented steam machinery for manufacturing processes, as well as in the vast supplies of metals and coal for its fabrication and work ing, and upon the unlimited means of com munication with foreign states which it then enjoyed through possessing the sovereignty of the seas, England sought to supply not only her own markets and those of her colonial dependencies, but ad foreign states, with every description of manufactured goods. Natural gifts have been so wisely distri buted amongst the different nations of the world, that each state may be said to pro duce something required by the others ; and this mutual dependence extends in propor tion as civilization advances. In olden times the trade between nations was limited to the simple exchange of the products of each state; but in prosecuting this exchange the attention of the more intelligent adven turers of European states became attracted to the rude methods employed in many countries of preparing and manufacturing the native products of the soil; and urged forward by the desire of gain, they com menced importing the raw products of those states and re-selling them in the shape of finished goods, and thus created a new branch of national industry. In order to accomplish these objects the newly-discovered machinery, which was*., regarded as the mainspring of the new enterprise, was strictly withheld from exportation, and even guarded from foreign eyes at home. The importation of manu factured goods was also prohibited ; and government undertook, by special regula tions, imposts, and restrictions, to balance and adjust the new with the old manufac turing interests of the country. And not forgetful of themselves, our rulers sought a a reward by imposing heavy import duties upon the raw materials which were drawn from abroad for the use of the newly-pro jected industries ; and these duties, coupled with the high protective imposts on corn, completed whatever was wanting to perfect the commercial policy upon which we had entered. It has been stated by Sir R. Phillips that \" the career of England in the experiment of manufacturing foreign products com menced about the year 1790, when some success in the invention of secret machinery led to statesmen's dreams that ' we might manufacture for all the world,' and by the sale of our fabrics command the wealth and natural productions of all nations.\" In accordance with the spirit of the age, this commerce, when commenced, was based entirely upon a selfish policy.

Broadly stated, the foreign commerce of the kingdom consists of importations of food and raw materials, and of exportations of half and wholly finished goods. extended to goods manufactured from native products, continued in force, as we have seen, with more or less strictness, up to 1842. For many years antecedent it was discovered by men of sense and judgment to be a policy of loss instead of gain. Annoyed by the restrictive legislation of this country, the governments of foreign states retaliated by placing more or less prohibitory duties upon our manufactured goods, producing others for their own consumption, and in this man ner reducing the outlets of English trade. On the other hand, a rapidly increasing population was springing up in England, requiring more food than the natural capa bilities of the soil could supply, and the vast accumulated power of machinery was want ing the means of profitable employment. The final results of the monopoly system were found to be stagnation of trade, with the necessary absence of the means of em ploying capital and labour, and dear food or starvation for the poorer classes of the community. We now proceed briefly to notice the effects of free trade upon the leading branches of industry upon which the country depends for the power of purchasing, not only many necessaries, but also many luxuries of life. The most important branch of native in dustry is that ofthe cotton trade ; and though we are entirely dependent upon foreign coun tries for the raw material, its rise and progress form perhaps the most extraordinary page in the annals of human industry. In order fully to appreciate the rapid development of this trade it may be useful to quote the follow ing sketch of its growth up to the year 1842, from Porter's \" The Progress ofthe Nation :\" \" In the year 1800 the quantity of cotton imported for use into the United Kingdom was fifty-six million lbs., having been only thirty-one and a half million lbs. in 1790, and eighteen million lbs. in 1785. The total value of manufactured cotton goods exported in 1800 was \u00a35,406,000, having been \u00a31,662,000 in 1790. At the earliest of these two dates Sir Richard Arkwright's inventions had very recently been thrown open to the public by the setting aside of his patent in the Court of King's Bench. The first steam engine constructed for a cotton mill was made by Mr. Watt, in 1785, and put to use at Papplewick, in Nottingham shire : it was four years later that the application of steam power to the same pur pose was first made in Manchester. In the year 1800 the number of such engines in , These facts, as well as those relating to the successive steps by which monopoly was exchanged for free trade, have, in another shape, been noticed in the previous section. They are repeated here in order to form a sort of starting point from which to trace the effects of free trade upon the progress of the leading national industries. The resources of the United Kingdom consist now, as for the greater part of a cen tury, of raw materials, manufactured goods derived from native products, and manufac tured goods derived from foreign products. Of these productions a large portion is re quired to supply the needs of the population at home ; the remainder being used to pur chase articles from abroad, such as corn, meat, tea, sugar, and raw materials for manufacture. In the absence of industrial records, no means exist of tracing the extent of the"], [475, "BRITISH COMMERCE XXXV that town had increased to thirty-two. This increase shows that a great impulse had been given to the manufacture, which already was considered to be a thing of great national importance. If, however, we measure its amount at that time in comparison with that which it has since received, the cotton trade of 1800 dwindles into comparative insigni ficance. At that time the application of the improved machinery was confined to the production of yarn ; for although Dr. Cart wright's power-loom was invented as early as 1787, the first practical application of his machine was not made until 1801, when a weaving factory was erected by Mr. Monteith at Pollokshaws, near Glasgow, and furnished with two hundred self-acting looms. Nor was it until after several years had elapsed that the imperfections and difficulties attend ant upon this new speculation were overcome, and that this interesting invention was ren dered a profitable instrument in the hands of that enterprising gentleman.\" that during the period in question the Eng lish cotton manufacturers made but small progress in their dealings with foreign nations, as compared with the results since obtained. The exports of cottons returned only \u00a321,674,000 in 1842, compared with \u00a320,620,000 in 1815. While the supply of the raw material augmented at the rate of four hundred and fifteen per cent., the increased quantities of exports, as measured by the official value of goods sent out of the country, only show an advance of two hundred and ten per cent. Owing, however, to the cheapness of cotton goods, and to the generally improved condition of the English population, the cotton manufacturers for a certain time found a market for their pro ductions at home. This outlet, however, was of limited extent, and as subsequent events tended to prove, insufficient for the successful encouragement and extension of the industry. The time arrived when it was found that either new foreign markets must be secured, or that the trade must be im mensely impeded in its progress. The progress of this manufacture between the years 1801 and 1814 was to some extent arrested by the wars which depressed other branches of industry. The return of peace brought an advance, which was steadily maintained until 1840, as is shown by the following statements of the imports of raw material and real value of manufactured goods exported: \u2014 It was at this critical moment that the free-trade policy was inaugurated by Sir Robert Peel. The total repeal of the im port duty on raw cotton was not only fol lowed by an enormous supply of the staple, but the value of cottons exported increased in even greater proportion. The following figures will illustrate the general progress in the cotton industry under free trade : \u2014 Bearing in mind the many economical processes introduced into the manufacture, Striking as these results appear, they as well as the decline in the price ofthe raw become the more remarkable when it is material which took place between 1815 and remembered that, towards the close of the 1842, it is clear from the figures above cited Raw Cotton taken for Consumption.

In consequence of the civil war which broke out in the United States, the supplies from America, which had hitherto formed about eighty per cent, of the entire supply, suddenly declined from one thousand one hundred and fifteen million lbs. in 1860 to six million lbs. in 1863. It is most probable that such a calamity under the old protective system would have been attended with still greater losses to England than actually occurred. But as it was, in consequence of the non-existence of restric tions, demand was followed by supply with marvellous rapidity. The total imports of raw cotton into the United Kingdom \u2014 proof of the natural power of supply to meet demand when unfettered by legislative re strictions : \u2014 Having noticed these exceptional circum stances, so unfavourable to the development of the cotton industry, let us examine what progress has actually been made in the face of all these difficulties, under free trade. There are no returns of the number of spindles employed in cotton factories in 1842. In 1850 twenty-one. millions were at work, and in 1860 about thirty-two mil lions. The number of power-looms was increased from about one hundred and ten thousand in 1842 to four hundred thousand in 1860. In 1842 the number of persons engaged in cotton factories may be taken at about two hundred and sixty thousand \u2014 one hundred and thirteen thousand males, and one hundred and forty-seven thousand females. In 1860 the numbers returned were one hundred and eighty-two thousand males and two hundred and sixty-nine thousand females, or an increase of sixty one per cent, of males and one hundred and eighty-three per cent, of females.

The im portations from Brazil during the same period increased fourfold, or from seventeen mdlion lbs. in 1860 to sixty-eight million lbs. in 1866. Numerous other countries, including the distant Empires of China and Japan, also came to the rescue, and had the American supply been longer with held, would probably have contributed still larger amounts. Although the cotton industry has greatly revived from the depression which it has lately undergone, it has hardly yet reached its former extent. Mr. Bazlcy, in an inter esting pamphlet issued during the time of the cotton crisis, gives the following sum mary of the position attained by this great branch of national industry : \u2014 \" The last year of full occupation for the cotton trade was in 1860: the extent ofthe trade and of its resources at that time may be referred to The subjoined table of importations in the years 1860 and 1866 afford a convincing Quantities of Raw Cotton Imported. 1860.

Factories had been built with astonishing rapidity, and filled with the greatest celerity with the most unproved spinning and weaving machinery, and the power of consuming cotton and of convert ing it into manufactures seemed almost to have attained its culminating extent. Ap proximately, the spinning spindles existing in the trade were thirty -two millions. Looms had relatively increased. Bleach works, printworks, dyeworks, engineering and machine -making establishments, had been vastly extended. Hamlets and villages had become small towns, and manufacturino plants were in their most enlarged and productive state. These fixed investments, including land and water rights, might amount in value to not less than sixty million pounds sterling, and to work all these concerns and their ramifications twenty midions more would be needed, making the mere productive capital eighty mdlions; to which must be added the value of mercantile and consumers' stocks in home and foreign markets, of cotton, of all auxiliary materials, and of bankers' capital devoted to this manufacturing and mercantile business, showing a further necessary capital of one hundred and twenty millions \u2014 making the whole gross capital employed in it two hundred million pounds sterling. Depend ing upon the industry associated with this large capital \u2014 including, with the workers in power factories, the handloom weavers, the printers, the bleachers, the dyers, the engineers and machine-makers, the working builders of mills and of dwellings, the card makers, the lace-makers, the hosiers, and the tradesmen supplying their wants \u2014 a population of about sive millions of men, women, and children may be reckoned for the whole of these classes in Great Britain One os the best tests of the effects of the free-trade policy on the cotton industry is afforded by the quantity and value of goods exported.

Such, briefly stated, have been the effects of commercial legislation upon the cotton industry. Under the protective policy, it became at length apparent that no attainable amount of mechanical skill, no economy, however rigid, could cope successfully with the obstacles involved in such a system of restriction. There was a largely-increasing population, and a growing impatience every where manifested itself, leading to the conviction that the protective system was and Ireland.\" In Hi illions. In M illions.

This prohibition was founded upon the belief that the long-staple or combing-wool of England is superior for some manufac- turing purposes to that of any other country, and that by keeping the raw material at home we should secure to ourselves the exclusive manufacture of certain fabrics. The mistaken policy of this selfish system has been rendered fully apparent since its abandonment. No sooner were the French manufacturers able to procure the combing- wool of England than they set their ingenuity at work to profit fully by the concession, and produced new stuffs from English wool, superior to any that we had produced in this country. Thus stimulated, our manufacturers also applied themselves to the discovery of superior processes, and in the course of a very few years have produced merinos and other stuffs in every respect equal to the fabrics of France. By this means our stuff manufacture has received an important impetus. In the five years from 1820 to 1824, while the prohibition to export English wool was still in force, the annual average shipments of that description of woollen goods amounted to 1,064,000 pieces. In the five years following, during which the removal of the restriction occurred, the average annual export of such goods amounted to 1,228,000 pieces. In the years 1840 to 1844 it reached 2,128,000 pieces, being exactly double the quantity exported during the last five years in which the prohibition existed. Brighter days arrived. The commercial policy of the nation was changed. Unre stricted imports of the raw material for the machines and of food for the workpeople led to increased production for both home and foreign markets ; and with the exception of the crisis consequent upon the civil war in America \u2014 which might have occurred under the old system with worse results \u2014 the records of the cotton manufacture under free trade show an uninterrupted course of advancement. The subjoined table exhibits the vast importance of the cotton trade in providing this country with the means of paying for goods imported from abroad, the extent being about one-third of the whole value. Next in importance to the cotton manu- facture stand the woollen and worsted industries of the kingdom. The woollen industry, it need scarcely be stated, is the oldest existing in the country, and has always been the object of much care and concern under every form of government from the earliest times. Con fining our remarks, however, to the position which it has occupied during the present century, let us ascertain what has been the relative progress in the woollen and worsted trades under the two commercial systems of legislation that have been in force during the period. The raw material employed in both the woollen and worsted branches is obtained partly from home and partly from foreign supplies. The produce of wool in the United Kingdom in the year 1828 was esti mated at about one hundred and forty-five million lbs.

A great demand has arisen of late years for fancy woollens, and the discovery of aniline has enabled manufacturers to meet the demand in a variety of new colours and patterns.

The linen manufacture, until its place was usurped by that of cotton, stood next in rank to the woollen industry of the country. It has been carried on for many generations in different localities.

It was suggested in Parliament in 1698 that the public advantage would be promoted were the woollen manufacture of the sister kincr dom discouraged and the linen manufacture assisted in its stead ; and this suggestion, instigated no doubt by the English woollen manufacturers, who were jealous of Irish progress in this particular, was carried into effect. recent years, the extent of land sown with flax in Ireland (the division of the kingdom in which it is principally cultivated) varies considerably from year to year. There arc no means of ascertaining the actual area under flax until 1847. It was estimated that in 1810 one hundred thousand acres were sown with flax in Ireland. If this statement be correct a great decline in the cultivation must have taken place; as in 1847 and 1849 only fifty-eight and sixty thousand acres, respectively, were under this crop. A great impetus to the growth of flax was given by the stoppage of the supply of raw cotton from America during the civil wTar, the high prices which linens commanded for some years acting as a strong encouragement to cultivators. The following table will show the extent of the increase : \u2014 During the past twenty years the manu facture of yarn and tissues has also been prosecuted in Yorkshire and Lancashire, where, owing to the use of steam-power, a great advance has been made. Another very important branch of the trade at Dun dee, combined with the manufacture of jute, which was introduced into that place about the year 1830, has greatly progressed since the introduction of free trade, as well as the other branches of the linen industry located in Scotland.

Flax being a more expensive material to work than cotton, its manufactures necessarily receded from com petition with more favourable conditions; and it is to this circumstance, perhaps, that we may attribute the reluctance of the linen manufacturers, more especially in Ireland, to substitute machine for hand labour. On the other hand, it must be remembered that a great deal of attention has been directed during the past fifteen years towards improve ments in the processes employed for steeping and preparing flax, with the view of elimi nating the gum in the fibre, the presence of which renders it difficult to spin. We have no means of tracing the increase of machinery, consequent upon the cotton famine, in the Scotch and English branches ofthe linen industry. But it is known that both branches very largely extended their operations, and many of the unemployed cotton factory hands found occupation in the linen factories of Barnsley and South Yorkshire. The following table shows the progress of the English and Scotch linen trades up to 1860: \u2014 The sudden calamity which fell upon the cotton industry in 1861 and subsequent years, reacted in a marvellous manner upon the linen trade, more especially as regards the Irish branch ; completing in a few years the work which, though advancing, would not perhaps, but for this exceptional cause, have been accomplished for a long time to come. In every district spindles and looms were multiplied, and new mills arose with remarkable rapidity. The number of power looms in Irish flax factories increased from The number of spindles in operation in 1835 is not stated. Great progress in the production of linen yarns has taken place during the last few years. \" Ten years ago,\" says Dr. Watts, in his \" History of the Cotton Famine,\" \" nine or ten leas per spindle per week of number 30's yarn was considered good work, but in 1865 eighteen leas ofthe same number were produced.\" It is to be hoped that the linen industry, which has thus been established upon a Lbs.

XLIII sound footing, will continue to enjoy the amount of prosperity which may be said to have been forced upon it by the occurrence of the cotton famine. prohibition, however, raw and thrown silk were highly taxed upon importation; a policy wdiich necessarily increased the sell ing price of the manufactured article, and thus, in addition to limiting its sale, induced a large clandestine introduction of silks from abroad, where manufacturers were able to produce at a much cheaper rate. Closely connected with the linen manu facture is the jute trade of Dundee, which has made great advances of recent years. The manufacture of jute was first introduced into Scotland about the year 1830. It is estimated that in 1865 no less than seventy two thousand tons of this fibre were employed in Dundee, engaging sixty factories, con taining one hundred thousand spindles and five thousand power-looms. The result of this system was to teach English manufacturers to rely rather upon custom-house regulations than upon their own skill and ingenuity for the disposal of their goods ; and routine usurping the place of invention, but little progress was made in the trade. When fluctuations arose, and in general periods of commercial difficulty, the manufacturers were loud in their com plaints to government against the losses they sustained by smuggling \u2014 a practice which the government was powerless to prevent. Thus the energies of the producers became paralyzed, and notwithstanding the progress made in branches of industry less favoured by legislative restrictions, and the superiority of almost every other class of machinery, the deadening effect of monopoly was so complete that the silk manufacture in Eng land, in 1825, was far inferior in appliances and means to those existing in the silk trades of France and Germany. The silk industry ofthe United Kingdom, like the cotton industry, is entirely depen dent upon foreign sources for the supply of the raw material. Though of less mag nitude than the other textile industries of the country, it has, especially of late years, attained considerable importance. Owing to many causes, the manufacture of silk is the most fluctuating in character of all the textde industries of the country ; the natural consequence being that the history of the trade in England shows a continued altern ation of prosperity and distress. It must, however, be admitted, that the greater part of the evfls from which the manufacture has suffered is due to the mistaken system of commercial legislation, which not only acted as an obstruction to a cheap and sufficient supply ofthe raw material, but also debarred the trade from its only source of progress \u2014 a healthy competition with foreign pro ducers. A glance at the condition of the commerce during the present century wdl fully bear out these statements. In the year 1824 an important change took place in the regulations affecting silk, leading to a considerable increase in the trade. The high import duty of 5*. 6t7. per lb. on raw silk was reduced to 3\u00c6; and that on thrown silk from 14s. 8d. to 7s. 6d.; and these were again subsequently reduced to Id. on raw silk, and to 3s. 6d. on thrown silk. The prohibition to import foreign manufactured silks was' also repealed, and an ad valorem duty of thirty per cent, placed upon them instead. Under the protective system, up to 1826, a great boon, at first sight, was conferred upon our silk manufacturers, in the shape of a complete monopoly of the home market foreign made silks being strictly shut out from these shores. As a set-off against this These changes may be said to have placed silk in a position midway between protection"], [484, "BRITISH COMMERCE. XLIV upon the removal of legislative restrictions, between the years 1820 and 1866, is indi cated by the following figures: \u2014 and free trade ; for while the manufac turer was permitted to obtain the raw material at a nominal rate of duty, the consumer of the foreign goods was made to pay a heavy penalty for his preference. The gain to manufacturers from this half measure was very great, as will be seen by a comparison of the quantities of raw silk obtained before and subsequent to the re duction ofthe duty: \u2014 \u25a0 Average Annual Amount of Raw, Waste, and Thrown Silk Imported. Lbs. Ten years preceding reduction of duty, . 1,882,000 Ten years following reduction of duty, . 3,678,000 The admission of foreign silks into the English markets, even at the high duty of thirty per cent, ad valorem, was nevertheless viewed with great apprehension and alarm by the majority of the silk manufacturers of the country, and many persons experi enced in the trade anticipated certain ruin to the English industry. But the fact was the other way. The effect of opening the market was found to be, that instead of usurping the place of native productions, the admission of foreign goods merely caused a decline in price, while it stimu lated the home production to such a degree that a considerable expansion of both trades was the result. As regards the supply of the raw material, each reduction of duty has been attended with increased importations. Another fact is also apparent\u2014that the foreign throwster has been entirely beaten in competition with the native throwster. It will be observed that there is a serious falling off in the supplies of raw silk since 1860, the cause being a disease which appeared in the silk-worm. This deficiency has not only been experi enced in England, but has caused great distress among the manufacturers in France. Combined with this misfortune, another cause has contributed to depress the trade during recent years. This is the change in the fashion which has substituted other trimmings to articles of dress in the place of ribbons. Setting these exceptional cir cumstances aside, it is evident that the position of the silk manufacturer has been greatly improved by free trade. But because in certain instances a depression happened to follow the abolition of import duties, the English silk manufacturers, who as a class have always dreaded foreign competition, generally assigned it to that cause. In 1845 the duties upon the importation of raw and thrown silk were abolished. But although considerable reductions in the import duties on manufactured silks were made from time to time, during the inauguration of the liberal commercial policy, free trade in silks was not fully established until 1860, when, by the com mercial treaty with France, the remaining duties upon the importation of the manu facture were swept away from the customs tariff.

Not only have our silk manufacturers been able to produce many descriptions of goods which formerly were entirely supplied by foreign producers, but they have also largely increased the sale of their productions abroad; and there is no reason to doubt, if our silk manufacturers would continue to employ the same means as are adopted by producers in every other trade, viz., improved machinery, skilled labour, and adaptation of their products to the wants of the day, that the English silk industry, under freedom of trade, would in many branches successfully compete with that of any other nation in the world. products. The general results have been increased returns to the manufacturers, better wages to the operatives, and a super ior class of product at a lower price to the consumer. The invention of the steam engine could scarcely have occurred in any country pos sessing greater means of profiting by such a discovery than England. Furnished by nature with immense supplies of coal and iron, stored, as it were, in the same locali ties, the materials necessary for the con struction and working of machinery may be found in almost every direction ; and it was owing to the happy circumstance of the discovery of these articles in such close proximity, that England was able to advance certain branches of her national industries even under restrictive legislation. It is impossible, within the limited space of this article, to trace the effects of free trade upon every manufacture in the king- dom. Closely connected with the four great textile industries above alluded to, are those of hosiery, under-clothing, and machine lace, each in itself of very large extent, besides numerous other smaller trades, all of which are dependent upon the four raw materials of cotton, wool, flax, and silk. Of these it may be stated generally that in every branch vast improvements have taken place during the past twenty 'years, resulting almost entirely from the unfettering of trade, and the admission of competition. In order to compete success- fully with the foreign producer, native manufacturers have been compelled to im- prove their machinery with the view to procure increased production, and conse- quently to lower the selling price of their goods; while, on the other hand, with the object of meeting the demands of a gener- ally improved taste both at home and abroad, they have been obliged to direct especial attention to the style and design of their It was not, however, until manufactures and trade were unshackled from the bondage of protection that the full benefits of the marvellous agency of steam were secured to the country. The change having been made, and fairly in course of extension, it was found that the causes which led to an increase in the foreign trade were also the means of exten sively developing the natural resources of the country, more especially those derived from the products of the mines. As mills and factories multiplied, machinery was multiplied also ; and to make and work the latter both iron and coal were in increased demand. With the extension of trade came also the extension of means of communica tion, and more iron and coal were wanted for railroads and steam ships. A vastly increased production of the common metals also became necessary to supply the demands of numerous branches of trade created by the increased home con sumption of different wares, as well as by the larger commercial dealings with foreign"], [486, "BRITISH COMMERCE.

The interference of the law became at last so intolerable to the trade that a committee of inquiry, in 1825, reported that manufacturers must either discontinue production, or produce at a loss. Modifications of duty followed this announcement; but until the decisive mea sure of repeal in 1845, very little progress was possible. The following table showing the quantities of glass retained for home consumption at the beginning of the century and at the period of the abolition of the duties, shows the paralyzing effect of past legislation upon this branch of native in dustry : \u2014 Years. Home Production. Imports. Few industries suffered more under the protective system than that of glass. Not only was this production \u2014 so important in many ways to domestic comfort \u2014 taxed to a vexatious extent, but the processes of the manufacture were so trammelled by regula tions necessary for the collection of the duty, that progress was next to impossible. The conditions enjoined by Act of Parlia ment with regard to the process of fabrica tion and the character ofthe article produced, %ven to such minutia as its thickness and weight, in addition to the pressure of the tax, were especially oppressive in a manu facture which depends for its success on the application of scientific principles to the various combinations employed. The primary intention of the excise laws was to secure the due payment of the tax; but they likewise assisted one branch of the industry at the expense of another. Thus a severe restriction was imposed upon the bottle and crown-glass trade, the object being to pro mote the use of flint glass, which is prepared Upon the removal of the duties there was a great fall in price, and an enormously increased consumption was the result.

Great as has been the progress in many branches of this manufacture during the past five and twenty years, there can be no doubt that a more general introduction of machinery in many of its processes would tend to still further development. and bottles. We find, however, that the value of glass and glass wares exported from the United Kingdom rose from \u00a3417,000 in 1840, to \u00a3801,000 in 1866. The home consumption has immensely increased, more particularly that of \"pressed\" glass, which is to a great extent made by ma chinery, and produced at such a low price that almost the poorest of the population may be supplied with elegant articles of domestic use, which a few years ago were only within the reach of the wealthy classes. Of the increase of the glass trade gener ally there are no records, but it is known to have been very great during the last fifteen years. The manufacture of chemical products constitutes one of the leading occupations of the population, and may be regarded as important, not only in forming an inde pendent trade of considerable extent, but also in its connection with the various industrial processes in which \"chemicals\" are so largel y employed. Its most important branch is that of alkali, and it is to the abolition of the excise duty on salt that this preparation owes its great development and perfection. The two greatest improvements derived from alkali during the last few years have been the increased production of caustic soda and bleaching powder, which are ex tensively used by paper-makers in utilizing esparto grass to serve as a substitute for rags. In addition to alkali of all descrip tions, numerous other important chemical products are made available to supply the wants created by the increased prosperity of our home manufactures. A very consider able increase in the quantity of alkali and soda exported from the United Kingdom, has taken place during the past ten years. In 1856 only one million four hundred and five thousand cwts. were exported, against two millions nine hundred and ninety-eight thousand in 1866. One great improvement consequent upon the repeal of the glass duties, has been the production of sheet and plate glass of greatly increased dimensions. This fact is not only visible in the ordinary dwellings and shops of the country, but is illustrated in a strik ing manner by the construction of such buildings as the Crystal Palace and the roofs ofthe vast railway stations ofthe metropolis. Indeed, had the glass duties existed in 1851, the beautiful idea ofthe Exhibition building of that year \u2014 which may be said to have added a new order to architecture \u2014 could never have been carried out, and would probably never have been conceived. The earthenware industry of the country, which may be considered as a staple trade, does not appear to have suffered directly from the hardships of legislative interfer ence. On the contrary, since the intro duction of free trade its progress has been much more rapid than formerly, and the manufacture, which was chiefly confined to Staffordshire (whose productions have long enjoyed a world-wide renown), has spread to many other districts of the country. Not only are the wants of thirty millions"], [489, "BRITISH COMMERCE. XLIX Since the repeal of the paper duty in 1861 no direct means exist of testing the increase of the manufacture in the kingdom ; but the introduction of a cheap press in the shape of penny newspapers, and the vast increase of cheap periodicals since that event \u2014 taken in conjunction with the increased importations of raw materials for paper makine \u2014 form sufficient evidence of the benefits that have accrued to this important branch of industry by its exemption from taxation. The abolition of the stamp duty on newspapers, and the increased facdities afforded by the Post-office for the transmis sion of newspaper packets, as well as of letters, at low rates of postage, have also induced a largely increased consumption of paper. Great improvements have been made in the machinery as well as in the chemical processes employed in this manufacture ; and by these means a large quantity of material that was formerly regarded as useless, is now worked up into common papers.

So long as protective or prohibitory duties existed abroad, any very great expansion of trade was therefore almost impossible. In vain might England buy of her neighbours, if the heavy taxes imposed upon her produce in foreign countries remained to exclude it from being freely sold in those neighbouring markets in exchange for what she bought. The only disadvantage, therefore, attending the adoption of free trade in England, while other states refused to follow the same course, related to the extension of the channels for the disposal of the surplus pro duction of the kingdom, so vastly needed owing to the immense stimulus given to all branches of native industry by the introduc tion of the new system. Having briefly traced the effects of free trade upon the external and internal trade of this country, and bearing in mind that England was the first to adopt a liberal com mercial policy, it remains but to inquire how far the example of England has been fodowed by other states, and to what extent she has benefited by such co-operation as they have accorded. The complete establishment of free trade in the United Kingdom realized only in part the hopes and wishes of the advocates of the system. Their object was, not only to witness the acceptation and adoption of the new policy by their own country, but also to see it generally extended. The establishment of commercial freedom in England, although productive of immense good, must always have remained a one sided advantage so long as other nations adopted a protective policy ; for the simple reason that although England derived great benefits by admitting raw materials, food, and manufactured articles free of duty, she could not dispose of her products in a corresponding degree so long as the price of those goods was artificially maintained abroad by the imposition of exorbitant im port duties. The position amounted simply to this \u2014 that while consumption was unlim- In spite of all efforts, and in spite of the force of example, it was long before any of the continental states began to assimilate their customs tariffs and trade laws to those of England. The annual accounts of the success that had attended the introduction ofthe liberal policy in this country, produced but little effect upon the governing bodies among our neighbours. During the period extending from the year 1842 to 1860"], [491, "BRITISH COMMERCE LI changes were made in the customs tariffs of several countries of Europe, some exhibiting a tendency to relaxation, and others to more exclusive treatment. But with the excep tion, perhaps, of the establishment of the Dutch tariff upon a liberal basis, the import duties levied by the leading governments of Europe, as well as by the United States of America, were generally so heavy as greatly to contract trade in the aggregate, and to prohibit it altogether in many special branches. although foreign countries profited so littlo by a protective policy, they could not easily be brought to believe that the new system would confer any greater advantages upon them. England had for so long given them nothing, that they now mistrusted her gifts. The treaty between England and France m 1860 thus became of great importance. It was the means by which the English system was extended to the Continent. It is with the results of this treaty, and with those of other treaties which have arisen out of it, that we now have to deal. And it is not too much to say that the benefits which have accrued, both to this country and to the nations which have followed her lead, are the direct consequences of the new commercial policy commenced by England in 1842. It was not until the year 1860 that the patience and long-suffering of England were rewarded by the ratification of a treaty of commerce with France, brought about by the good offices of Richard Cobden with the Emperor Napoleon III. This treaty, which was lightly regarded at the time, paved the way for the destruction of the monopoly system throughout the continent of Europe. It may be interesting, however, before referring especially to the French treaty, to inquire how it was that so many years were spent in reconciling our more immediate continental neighbour to the fact that her commercial progress depended upon the assimilation of her customs tariff to our own. In this respect France but occupied a posi tion common to all the states of Europe. Before the dawn of the dark age of protec tion in this country, a treaty of commerce of a very liberal nature had been concluded between England and France ; but its exist ence was terminated by the occurrence of war in 1793, and from that date until 1860 no common agreement upon the subject could be arrived at between the two coun tries. The treaties of reciprocity into which England was driven in 1823 contributed practicady but to secure protective duties upon slightly easier terms. There is ample evidence to prove that the unsoundness of the protective system was fully understood by many enlightened men on the Continent, and especially in France, long before Sir Robert Peel introduced his first free-trade measures to the British Par liament ; and that the effects of the reduc tions of duties in our tariff in 1824 and 1831 had not been overlooked by the advocates of a liberal commercial policy. Unfortunately, the friends of that policy had little power or influence, and the French government (between whom and the manufacturers there existed a strong tic) was led to attribute England's success to causes apart from the operation of the new system. The unwillingness of European states to make any concessions in their import tariffs favourable to this country arose, it must be admitted, from the mistaken policy which England had pursued from the termination ofthe great war in 1815 until the change in her commercial system commenced in 1842. Nations, like men, are prone to follow bad examples ; and the selfish principle so long maintained by Great Britain was faithfully followed by every continental state. And"], [492, "LII BRITISH COMMERCE The inability of foreign producers to com pete with English producers upon equal terms was attributed to a variety of circum stances. The peculiar geographical situa tion of England; its extensive sea-coast and numerous ports, affording every advan tage to shipping; the industrial and com mercial habits of its population, forced in a great measure by the insufficiency of the natural powers of the country to supply the main necessaries of life; the vast supplies of coal and iron, the two most essential elements in all manufacturing industry; the large amount of accumulated capital in the country in mills, factories, and machinery; the extent of its merchant navy; the facili ties of internal communication \u2014 all these were among the arguments advanced. In the face of such assertions not only the French but all foreign governments appear to have felt themselves powerless to act ; and they probably comforted themselves with the assurance, not uncommon with some Euro pean governments in the present day, that free trade can be arrived at only through a period of protection, and that the time had not arrived when the one system could be safely abandoned for the other. the purpose of supporting a comparatively small number of native manufacturers or producers. But though so little commercial progress, in an international point of view, was made on the Continent up to 1860, at least one very important measure was enacted, namely, the institution of the \" Zollverein,\" or union of German customs; which, though not productive of an immediate expansion of the foreign trade, was greatly instrumental in developing the natural resources of all of the leading states of Germany. By this institution a large number of the northern and central German states were admitted to the privileges of free trade among themselves. It may appear strange that the benefits which the German states derived from free trade amongst themselves, should not have induced them to extend the same treatment to exchanges with foreign nations ; and the only reasonable explanation is that before mentioned, namely, the predominating desire to secure every advantage to themselves, upon the selfish principle practised by England. Among the causes which led to more liberal ideas, the International Exhibition of 1851 must hold a prominent place. This had a great, though not immediate effect, in bring- ing about the desired change in the com- mercial policy of France, and had an indirect effect through that country upon several European states. Between the English Ex- hibition of 1851 and the French Exhibition of 1855 numerous reductions of duty were made in the tariff of France ; but it was still evident that the government of that country had not the power to effect any radical reforms in her commercial system. The timid policy pursued during this period was continued up to 1859, when negotiations were commenced between Mr. Cobden and the Emperor, which resulted in the treaty of commerce of 1860. The chief features of The great impediment to progress seems thus to have arisen from the fear of English competition, to which foreign nations, rather than engage in a struggle, seemed to prefer yielding at once. The natural consequence was the entire exclusion from continental markets of many articles of British produce, while others were admitted only at a high rate of duty, which, together with costs of transport and expenses, precluded their sale at a lower price than would leave a margin of thirty to one hundred per cent, profit to the continental producers of similar goods. The general effect of this course of legis lation was to tax consumers in their own states in a most exorbitant manner, for"], [493, "BRITISH COMMERCE.

The power of the French ironmasters was such as to enable them to obtain a special article, secur ing a specific duty on bar iron of seven francs per hundred kilogrammes until 1864, and of six francs subsequent to that date, in lieu of a rate deduced according to the general scope of the treaty from the average current mar ket price of the metal in England. It is unnecessary to add, that the duties on bar iron form the standard by which all other iron duties are calculated. before the test of experience in her case. It may here be asked what have been the results of the change adopted by France in 1860? \" It was loudly and constantly urged by the French protectionists, that the treaty of commerce between Great Britain and France in 1860 would, by inundating the French markets with British manufactures, effect the destruction of some of the national industries of France.\" In this respect the French protectionists only followed the course which had been pursued by men of the same way of thinking in England for many years previously, the fears entertained by both classes being equally groundless. The following statistics of the develop ment of French commerce since 1859, taken from the returns published by the French government, afford conclusive evidence of the great gain which France has derived from her new policy: \u2014 The value of the French treaty must not, however, be estimated by the benefits which it conferred upon the exchange between England and France alone. It was con ceived with a far wider purpose in view, inasmuch as the French government hoped to employ the reduced tariff conceded to England as a means of obtaining corre sponding reductions in the tariffs of all the other leading European states, and thus to effect a general reduction in the scale of import duties levied in Europe. The question of export duties was not touched upon in the negotiation with Eng land ; but in 1861, in the treaty between France and Belgium, France abolished all export duties with the single exception of those upon rags and pulp for paper-making, which she retained with the sole view of forcing other states to abolish their export duties on similar articles on condition that France took a corresponding step. The example of England in shaping her commercial policy in accordance with the doctrines of free trade had hitherto pro duced little effect upon continental govern ments ; but the example of France was all-powerful, and no sooner had England converted France than France began to convert her neighbours, and this even Exclusive of specie and bullion.

The imports for consumption form but a part of the total imports into France ; a large quantity of goods being bought on account of other continental mar kets, or passing in transit. The develop ment of this branch of trade, under the new commercial systems has been greater even than the other. Whilst the value of IMPORTS FOR CONSUMPTION. goods imported into France for consump tion, between 1861 and 1866, increased by 351,200,000 francs, or at the rate of fifteen per cent, increase, the increased value of goods imported for re-export amounted in the same period to no less than 408,500,000, or at the rate of sixty-four per cent. increase. This extraordinary increase in the sup ply of raw materials for manufacture is the chief advantage gained by France from the reduction of the duties. The above facts are especially interesting as illustrative of the soundness of the English system. Native producers, viewed as an entire class, have, it is clearly shown, nothing to fear but every thing to hope from free trade. That this conclusion is justified will be seen by the development in the export trade of France during the period under consideration : \u2014 The above results prove in the most complete manner that the successful opera tion of free trade in England is not due to any exceptional circumstances, but that, on the contrary, similar results will follow wherever a similar policy is pursued. The recognition of this fact in France has at length been made in a most satisfactory way, by the decision of the French Parliament in the recent debate (1868) on the effects of the treaty of commerce of 1860 upon French industry. The wisdom of legislating for the consumer is now beginning to be under stood in France, as well as in England ; and though doubtless many attempts will yet be made in the former, as they were in the latter state, long after the introduction of free trade, to prevent the complete adoption of the new system, we entertain little doubt that the cause of the consumer will ultimately achieve as complete a victory over the producer in France as it has in England.

The following table represents the value of the trade between the two countries, according to the returns published by the British Board of Trade : \u2014 \u25a0 the effects of the French legislation above referred to upon the two branches of Eng lish export trade: \u2014 From these figures we perceive that in less than eight years our export trade to France has been nearly trebled, and in the same period we have drawn more than twice as much from that country in the shape of imports. It is, however, an important fact that France has not only become a greater trader with this country since concluding the treaty of 1860, but has also become a greater consumer of our national and colo- nial productions. We have no means of ascertaining from the English trade returns what proportion of the goods annually exported from England to France remain - for consumption in that country ; but on this point we can obtain a general estimate from the French returns. According to the French statistics the value of goods imported from the United Kingdom for consumption in France increased from \u00a311,000,000 in 1859 to nearly \u00a325,500,000 in 1866. The annexed figures show the progressive increase in the intervening years : 1859, \u00a311,128,000* 1860 12,332,000* 1861, 17,524,000* 1862 21,028,000* 1863, 23,704,000* 1864, 22,688,000 1865, 23,988,000 1866, 25,492,000 * These figures include the importations from the British colonies in the Mediterranean, which were not separated until the year 1864. Large importations of raw silk from the East reach France by this route. The value of imports above given includes costs of freight, &c, to this country. The value of exports is that of the value of the goods at British ports of shipment, and exclusive of costs of freight to French ports. These figures must, we think, afford conclusive evidence of the great benefits which England has derived from the treaty. It must be borne in mind that the lowest rates of duty fixed by that instrument did not come into operation until October, 1864, from which date, it will be observed, a fresh impetus to the trade between the two countries took place. Independently of the reduction of the import duties provided for by the treaty, and which chiefly related to those on half and wholly manufactured goods of British origin, the French government, during the years 1860 and 1861, either entirely abol ished or reduced to a merely nominal rate the duties imposed on the leading raw materials employed in textile manufac tures, thereby creating a fresh outlet for the produce of many of our colonial pos sessions.

A reference to the revolution created in the wine trade in this country by the reduction in the rate of import duty in 1860 scarcely belongs to this place; but an allusion to the effect of that reduction upon the importations of wine from France may not be considered inappropriate. chief means of enabling England to tide over one of the most severe struggles that she has had to encounter in recent times. Looking at the treaty of commerce between England and France from a French point of view, we may consider it merely the first step in a scheme devised for procuring a general re- duction of import tariffs throughout Europe. England had already thrown open her ports to the goods of all comers ; and therefore, as foreigners had nothing more to gain from her, they could not see the policy of follow- ing her example, for the especial advantage, as they imagined, of English producers. France was, however, in a very different position. Her ports were closed against the goods of most nations, and she would consent to open them only upon the condition that other states made fresh concessions in her savour. The treaty rates, as conceded to England, were framed so as to form the basis of all subsequent negotiations. IMPORTS OF FRENCH WINES. We have indicated briefly the operation of the partial adoption of free trade in France, and must now trace the effects of the recognition of that system by France upon the policy of other continental states. Had the French treaty been productive of no other advantage to this country, the means which it provided for absorbing so large a portion of British manufactures at a time of the deepest distress, would of itself be sufficient to mark it as an act of the highest importance to our interests. But for the relief thus afforded, the cotton famine would not only have caused the utter ruin of the majority of the class engaged in the cotton manufacture in England, but its disastrous effects would have spread still more widely among the great body of the population engaged in commercial and manu facturing pursuits, leading inevitably to a serious decline in the general trade of the country as well as in the public revenue. The increased commerce with France, owing to the operation of the new treaty, was the We must not omit to mention, as an ex ception to the work of France, the enactment of the treaty of commerce between England and Turkey in 1860, by which very moder ate duties were imposed. The results of this arrangement have been highly favour able to both countries. The treaty between France and Belgium, concluded in 1861, was the first negotiated by the former country under her new com mercial system. All the reductions of duty, and trading privileges generally, accorded in 1860 by France to England, were ex tended to her continental neighbour, who also made considerable modifications in her customs tariff. In 1862, by virtue of a treaty between England and Belgium, British goods were admitted into Belgium at the reduced rates established by the treaty with France. Several further reductions have been adopted in the Belgian tariff, partly in connection with treaties of com- Years. Quantities.

Relatively to the population, Belgium exported about \u00a33 sterling worth of goods per head in 1858 against \u00a35 worth in 1866. That country has therefore materially gained by adopting a liberal commercial policy. But as she has found larger markets for her own productions, so has she become a larger consumer of the productions of foreigners, and England has participated in this branch of her trade. In 1860 the declared value of British exports to Belgium amounted to \u00a31,600,000 sterling; in 1866 they had almost doubled in amount. The re-exports of foreign and colonial mer chandise from England to Belgium also increased in about the same proportion. The effects of the alterations in the Bel gian tariff upon the general commerce of Belgium, as well as upon the interchange of goods between Belgium and England, are shown in the following statistics : \u2014 IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF MERCHANDISE INTO AND FROM BELGIUM. About the same time that Belgium was concluding a treaty of commerce with this country, a revised Dutch tariff was established in pursuance of the liberal policy long fol lowed by that country. The Dutch, who have, in modern times, always been far in advance of all other continental states as regards customs regulations, were doubtless anxious that their credit in this respect should be maintained; and they therefore, irrespective of all treaty obligations, pro ceeded to perfect the policy which they had so long upheld. The new duties which were fixed upon many articles of British produce, in common with those of other states, amounted to five per cent, ad val orem. Amongst the goods liable to this rate were : \u2014 agricultural implements, candles, carpets, chinawares, copperwares, earthen wares, glass and glasswares, hats, ironwares, manufactures (textile, including hosiery and haberdashery) of cotton, of flax and hemp, of silk, of wool ; mercery, millinery, paper, parasols and umbrellas ; while yarns were admitted at three per cent, ad valorem. IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF MERCHANDISE INTO AND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM AND TO BELGIUM. From the first of these tables it is apparent that the Belgian producers have, like those of England and France, been considerable gainers by the reductions made in the im port duties. In the face of increased imports, the value of Belgian produce exported shows an annually augmenting amount.

LXI policy on more enlightened principles, there can be but little doubt that, despite all difficulties, her commercial statistics, instead of recording at the present time a declining trade with her foreign competitors, would have chronicled an amount of success quite equal to that obtained in the other European states, which have had the wisdom to take a bolder course. the Hanse Towns, exhibit in a strong degree the advantages resulting both to the Zoll verein and to England, from the adoption of a more liberal customs tariff in the former state. The conversion of Austria to the advanced system of commercial legislation, forms a peculiar exception to the manner in which the other states of Europe embraced free trade. The conversion, instead of being effected by the agency of France, was pro cured through the instrumentality of Eng land. As far back as the year 1865, a treaty of commerce was concluded between the United Kingdom and Austria, by which the latter state agreed not to levy import duties on British goods exceeding twenty-five per cent, ad valorem, from 1st January, 1867, and twenty per cent, from 1st January, 1870. As in the case ofthe French treaty, the above ad valorem limits were to be con verted into specific rates of duty by a mixed commission. The tariff of the Zollverein was also re modelled in 1862, on the occasion of the treaty between France and the German Union ; but England did not participate in the consequent reductions until 1865. It is not possible to trace the effects of the new tariff upon the general trade of the Union, inasmuch as there are no records of the value of goods subject to customs duties. The disturbed state of Germany during the years 1866 and 1867, arising from the war between Prussia and Austria, and from the generaUy depressed condition of trade since the commercial crisis of 1866, has been anything but favourable to commercial pro gress. There can be little doubt, however, that the energies of the north German states will be actively engaged, now that peace and confidence have, presumably, been restored. Owing to the war with Prussia, in 1866, and to the many internal difficulties which have existed since that time, the provisions of the treaty were not carried into effect until the 1st July, 1868. Since concluding the treaty with England, Austria has also entered into like arrange ments with France, Italy, and Prussia, and the result of these negotiations has led to very considerable tariff concessions on the part of Austria \u2014 concessions which will place the Austrian customs tariff, in most respects, on a par with those in force in the leading European states. As regards commercial relations between Eno-land and the Zodverein, we are in a position to trace them only to the extent of the trade which is carried on directly between the United Kingdom and Prussia. The Board of Trade returns for 1867 show a marked improvement in this branch of German transactions. In 1860 the declared value of British exports to Prussia amounted to \u00a31,884,000; in 1867 they reached the sum of \u00a32,879,000 \u2014 showing an increase of one million sterling. A movement is now on foot in North Germany, the object of which is to obtain a considerable simplification of the existing Zollverein tariff, and with many chances of success. Should this enterprise succeed, it will scarcely be possible for Austria long to withstand the example set by Germany.

In accordance with this policy a Report on the subject of Tariff Reform was presented to the Emperor in July, 1867. In that document we are told that the measures hitherto taken by the imperial government have had the effect of constantly developing native industry, but that, at the same time, they have not pro- duced an increased revenue to the public exchequer. It is declared that Russian industry still requires a considerable amount of protection, and consequently that as large a customs revenue as is raised in other states of Europe where domestic manufac- tures are firmly established cannot be obtained; but it is still considered that an increased revenue may be derived from customs duties by lowering the import tariff to such an extent as will protect native industries while preventing contraband trade. To remedy existing defects, the report proposes to assimilate the rates of duty by sea and by land; to reduce the rates of duty on articles which are now chiefly smuggled into the empire ; to amend the tariff classification to the extent which is found necessary for the guidance of merchants and importers, who are now liable to heavy fines and penalties in consequence of erro neous declarations; and to amalgamate the additional and special duties with those of the ordinary tariff rates ; abolishing them in those instances where the latter are con sidered to afford sufficient protection to the branches of industry which they are estab lished to protect. In 1865 the tariffs of Sweden and Norway were also reduced, in connection with the treaty of commerce between those states and France. Switzerland, the Papal states, and Portugal, have likewise made considerable alterations in their customs tariffs by arrange ments with the French government, who have been the prime movers in the progress of commercial legislation on the Continent since 1860. England has, indeed, been admitted to the enjoyment of all the con cessions made by the respective countries, with the exception of the recent reductions in Portugal; but she has obtained them only through the instrumentality of French legislation. In fine, such has been the spread of liberal commercial principles in Europe, that protection may be said to possess but two strongholds, which are to be found in Russia and Spain; but even in these two states signs of a decay in the old selfish policy are daily becoming manifest. In Spain, the Revolutionary power, which has now gained the ascendancy, has already evinced a desire of reducing the customs duties; but the realization of this object will, of course, very much depend upon the ultimate form which the government of Spain may take. No country in Europe presents so wide a field for the devolopment of free trade as Russia. Possessed of large terri- es tories, with extensive natural resources and an abundant population, she requires nothing but a more enlightened system of commercial policy to improve her condition to an indefi nite extent. Aroused by the annual loss to the revenue (an immediate effect of the exorbitant import tariff lately in force) from contraband trade, the government is at the present moment engaged in seeking how Mr. Michel, in a recent report upon the commercial relations between England and Russia, observes that while in all other countries in Europe there is a decided and well rewarded tendency to draw tighter the"], [503, "BRITISH COMMERCE lxiii bonds of international dependence in matters of commerce, the Russian system seeks divergence and isolation, to the ultimate destruction of foreign trade, which can exist only in the form of an interchange of com- modities. The policy of impeding foreign importation is, however, so contrary to all natural laws, and to all individual and public interests, that in the opposition which it indirectly encounters its object is entirely defeated. The Russian prohibitive tariff exists only on paper: the advantages which it offers to illicit importation are so great that the introduction of foreign commodities is, indeed, but little hindered. Russia im- ports secretly about the same quantity of foreign manufactures that she might pur- chase openly of honest traders, to the pal- pable advantage of international intercourse and of her own export trade. The tariff of Russia takes the trade in foreign productions out of the hands of the merchant and the capitalist, and places it in those of the Hebrew and Polish contrabandist. The result is that British and other foreign merchandise enters Russia, through Prussia, on payment of a premium of about thirty-five per cent., calculated on existing tariff rates, charged by houses regularly established for the transport and insurance of contraband coods. The extent of this contraband trade 'may be estimated from the accounts of the extensive seizures annually made by the Russian officials, but which, of course, form a comparatively smad part of the whole amount of illegal transactions. dustries by excluding foreign competition. The proofs of the complete failure of this system, in all other states, have not yet been clearly understood nor apprecated at St. Petersburg, as the new tariff recently published affords, unfortunately, ample evidence. Reviewing the progress of free trade on the Continent since 1860, it must be admitted that \u2014 if allowance be made for the many adverse circumstances that have arisen to check its course, and notwithstanding that protection still holds its sway in one or two countries \u2014 a very satisfactory advance is marked by the introduction of the respective measures above noticed in the majority of the European states, tending towards a recognition of the advantages of the new commercial policy. Commencing with the French treaty, we have witnessed the rapid spread of liberal commercial princi ples throughout almost every country of the Continent except Spain and Russia; and if we reflect upon the slow growth of free trade in England, the rapidity of the change brought about on the Continent will assume an increased value. In the New World but little progress in free trade is visible. The United States, emerging from a disastrous civil war, continues to support a most exorbit ant tariff, to the detriment of the con sumers within her own territory. It is satisfactory to find, however, that our trade with America has regained the pro portions which it had reached before the internal troubles of that country. The declared value of British exports to the United States during the past two years, 1866 and 1867, has exceeded that of the exports in 1860; and this has been accom plished in the face of great commercial depression in this country. Though the condition of America is not at the pre- Unless some great change be introduced it is scarcely possible, therefore, that foreign nations will be able materially to extend their commercial dealings with Russia.

A wide field for improvement, as regards the reduction of duties and simplification of classification of tariffed articles, exists in the customs tariffs of all the states of South America. The frequent recurrence of civil strife and disorder in that part of the world must always remain a strong impediment to progress. Unlike the colonial possessions of European countries, but slender ties, if We cannot close our remarks upon the growth of free trade abroad without a painful allusion to the fact, that in some of our colonial possessions a strong tendency is shown towards the establishment of the policy which has so signally failed, as well in the mother country as in all other foreign states where it has been pursued."], [505, ""], [506, ""], [507, ""], [508, ""], [509, ""], [510, ""]]
