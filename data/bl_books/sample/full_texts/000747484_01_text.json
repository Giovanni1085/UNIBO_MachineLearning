The native Irish song-writers of the period embraced in this volume have left compositions having an interest to their countrymen, beyond that evoked by their peculiar and undoubted merit. The following is a selection from their writings, and is confined to authors of undoubted Celtic descent. Biographical notices, necessarily brief and condensed, of the principal writers from whom selections have been made are included in the volume. The arrangement of the songs into Love Songs, Convivial Songs, and Patriotic Songs, will be found advantageous to the reader. The collection contains songs of various degrees of merit, but, while the majority are fairly worth repro ducing, some specimens not altogether of the highest order are included. The names of a few of the authors have not an Irish sound, but I have assured myself that these are but Anglicised forms of Celtic cognomens. I have included no living author in this present series.

THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. That Ireland possessed a literature of its own in very remote ages, and that in it poetry, as then understood, occupied a foremost place, are facts which have been abundantly proved. Hardiman, Walker, and Miss Brooke \u2014 names well known in connection with the literature of the early poetry of the nation \u2014 have done much by researches and translations towards enabling us to form an estimate of these ancient singers, and to encourage us to believe that, in spite of the hyperbole and weary itera tion and commonplace which mark many of their effu sions, they were somewhat more and better than mere rhapsodists and extemporisers. Hardiman gives examples of compositions of a date about 1000 B.C. \u2014 compositions which he can praise. Yet, however much at fault the chronology may be, and however ordinary the composi tions may be, there is satisfactory evidence that in most ancient times the chief bards of the nation, called Ollamhs, held a position inferior only to the king. Walker's book on the subject points out that, in com-"], [16, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 2 pliance with a law that each class should distinguish it self by a certain number of coloured stripes on their garments, these Ollamhs wore the greatest, next after the regal, number; and that this law is supposed to be anterior to the time of the Druids, a race by the way now being debated out of any real existence. The person of an Ollamh was sacred \u2014 more sacred even than royalty ; for kings were killed and plotted against, but the Ollamhs lived unmolested, seared, and worshipped. At some subsequent period of Irish history, the bardic functions were divided and distributed amongst four classes : the chief bards (Fileas) \u2022 the law-makers and law-givers (Brehons) ; the historians and genealogists (Seanachies) ; and the instrumental musicians (Orfidigh). The duties of the chief bard were honourable, and his recompense was substantial. Each king or chief had a principal poet, and a score or so of inferior poets. The chief poet was the confidant and trusty counsellor of his prince ; he cheered his master's drinking hours with feast-songs, he soothed his repose with love-stories, he animated him and his warriors on the field of battle with his war-songs : ' marching,' remarks Walker, ' at the head of the army, arrayed in white flowing robes, harps glittering (sic) in their hands, and their persons surrounded with instrumental musicians.' The rewards for these distinguished and imposing services were grants of castles and lands\u2014of which Mr. Joyce finds evidence in the present names of places, \u2014 gifts of valuable personal adornment, and the highest consideration and intimate friendship of royalty. The illustrious monarch Ollamh Fodhla \u2014 the King Alfred of Irish history \u2014 who insti tuted the Great National Convention, founded, it is said, seminaries for poetry and learning at Tara, the historic"], [17, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 3 hill whose very name is suggestive, being ' so-called from Tea-mur, the wall of music and melody.' All of these Tara bards were doubtless great in their day, but are not now worth a serious thought ; and we fear, notwithstanding Mr. Hardiman and Mr. Walker, that to the nineteenth century, the Irish bards and poets of the first are altogether an uninteresting race very much of the Windbag type. There are, of course, some strokes of nature \u2014 some simple sentiment \u2014 some heart felt sorrows expressed here and there ; but the chaff is in abundance, the wheat-grains occasional and sparse. Ossian or Oisin is said to have lived about 250 \u2014 300 A.D., and though nothing authentic of his survives, MacPherson's forgeries are perhaps fairly illustrative of what Ossian may have written, and they may be reason ably regarded as representative of the best bardic work of the time. And what is Ossian as we have him ? Grattan acknowledged that the Ossianic poems are cal culated to inspire ' valour, wisdom, and virtue ;' but the opinion was in response to a dedication of the Baron de Harold's composition of so-called Ossianic fragments. But one cannot to-day read MacPherson's Ossian \u2014 we never tried the Baron's\u2014 from cover to cover ; tumid, stilted, bombastic, \u2014 insipidities and absurdities abound on every page, and the passages worth reading can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Miss Brooke dis covered in an anonymous chant of this period (circa a.d. 300), a work of one Fergus, an ' Ode to Gaul, the Son of Morni,' and found it full of excellences ; but even in Miss Brooke's stirring and sympathetic transla tion there is nothing remarkably brilliant. In another, by the same author, assumedly a 'War Ode to Osgur, the Son of Oisin,' she finds a sentence which elicits 1 \u2014 2"], [18, "4 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. from her the following comment : ' It is impossible that the utmost stretch of human imagination and genius could start an image of greater sublimity than this ' ! This wonderful image which drove the talented translator into ecstasies is as follows : ' As the proud wave on whose broad back The storm its burden heaves,' etc. And she further says, 'Had Fergus never given any further proof of his talents than what is exhibited in the ode now before us, this stanza alone would have been sufficient to have rendered his name immortal' Im mortality was cheaply earned in Miss Brooke's opinion. It is to be regretted that the general tone of comment by Irish exponents on Irish subjects is one of enthusias tic gush. Enthusiasm has done much for the world, and it is a quality always admirable and oftentimes ap propriate. But the indiscriminate ecstasy that fondles and gushes over a subject, not because of its abstract worth or intrinsic merit, but because it is Irish and old \u2014 is a species of enthusiasm that tends to defeat the object it would advance. It invites hostile criticism, and is open wide to it. Walker even lets his enthusiasm run riot till one is not impressed or converted, but amused into a smile. For example, in reference to Carolan, he writes : ' The spot on which his cabin stood will be visited at a future day with as much true devotion by the lovers of natural music, as Stratford-on-Avon and Binfield are by the admirers of Shakespeare and Pope.' This is too extreme : it is altogether out of proportion to Carolan's place in song, high as it is, or to his merits, great as they are, to compare him to Shakespeare and Pope. If Walker's or Miss Brooke's judgment is so extravagant on these points, critics will say that it is not"], [19, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 5 to be relied on at all \u2014 they will be esteemed as blind guides whom it were a vanity to follow. In the translations accessible to us of sundry Odes and Laments, attributed, with sufficient evidence, to the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries, there is sometimes some thing to be admired, though very little worth remember ing. The scope and standard of the bards' abilities continued almost unvaried \u2014 perhaps indeed they de teriorated \u2014 until the Danish incursions, and the con sequent ravages, burnings, and slaughterings ruined the peaceful pursuit of the ' arts of peace,' and poetry lan guished and poets fell from their high estate. About the time of the English invasion, there seem to have been three or four notable poets ; but after that, the profession was apparently entirely neglected. Giraldus Cambrensis discovered no poets, but even his hostile soul admired the native Irish music. ' The skill of the Irish in music,' he wrote, ' is incomparably superior to that of any other nation. For their modulations are not slow and morose, as in the instruments of Britain, to which we are habituated ; but the sounds are rapid and precipitate, yet sweet and pleasing .... Such agreeable swiftness, such unequal parity, such discordant concord .... so delicately pleasing, so softly soothing, that it is manifest the perfection of their art lies in concealing art' From this almost unwilling testimony we may assume that if the spirit and art of Poetry were moribund, those of Music were in full vitality and vigour. The minstrelsy did not then \u2014 nor for centuries later \u2014 lapse into desuetude. ' Musica peritissime,' says Higden of it in the thirteenth century. Bacon heard the Irish harp and praised it : its music was 'melting' to him. Evelyn said it was"], [20, "6 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. superior ' to whatever speaks with strings.' Fuller, in his ' Holy War,' has a kindly word to say of it. It was but natural that this minstrelsy and consummate playing on the harp should resuscitate the art of Poetry. Music and Poetry are mutual handmaidens \u2014 and so, after a blank lapse of a couple of centuries, we find bards and bardism reviving. The O'Dalys are the most conspicuous of the race ; one Donough More O'Daly, Abbot of Boyle about 1230, was called the Irish Ovid. His brother, Carrol O'Daly, was, it is asserted, the author of the music and words of the beautiful and un surpassed melody, ' Eileen-a-roon.' The history of this composition is a romance in itself- the lyric is of the tenderest, and the melody so affected Handel that he said he would rather have created that simple air than be the author of the most elaborate composition he had published. Carrol O'Daly deserves immortality far better than Miss Brooke's friend, the ancient Fergus. It was, however, but a brief revival of bardism. The perpetual internecine struggles extinguished again the poetic spirit. The bards also had used their position to stir up strife and encourage feuds and factions : they be came political agitators under the guise of musicians. They were proscribed ; and by the statute of Kilkenny (Edward III.) it was made penal to shelter one of them. They \u2014 such as they were \u2014 led a fugitive life, and sunk to a very low level : became village satirists or perambu lating versifiers ; lost their natural power and place \u2014 the very poetry was harassed out of them. Edmund Spenser, in his ' View of the State of Ireland,' advocated their abolition. He had, it is true, 'caused divers of their poems to be translated unto me, and surely they savoured of sweet wit and good invention ...."], [21, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 7 sprinkled with some pretty flowers of their natural device which gave grace and comeliness unto them.' But, notwithstanding, he found that they ' seldom choose the sayings and doings of good men for the argument of their poems ; but whomsoever they found lawless in life, most dangerous and desperate in his disobedience, him they set up and glorify, and make an example to the young men to follow.' Hence, argued the gentle Spenser, it were expedient the race of bards should be extermi nated. The race, however, though proscribed, lingered on, and were represented by men of varying ability in each succeeding century. Some translations from the songs of the better-known of these in later times are given herein, but, with few conspicuous exceptions, there is nothing very brilliant or remarkable in the poems, odes, and songs of the transition period \u2014 that is, the period when the English language was superseding the native. The old system of hereditary hardship was maintained down to the Elizabethan wars \u2014 a system which, though sanctioned and hallowed by antiquity, was, from a poetic point of view, open to the objection that the divine afflatus is not hereditary, and that a very eloquent bard and poet might be the ancestor of a race of most un poetic and altogether worthless bards. The bardic pro ductions of this long transition period run in one trite groove : denunciation of invaders and settlers \u2014 Crom well and his men \u2014 and attachment to the Young Pre tender and hope of his restoration. In fact, the songs of this time are political in a great measure, and with political minstrelsy the ancient race of hereditary bards in Ireland happily became extinct. And a new and better style of composition \u2014 more true to nature, more"], [22, "8 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. simple, more homely \u2014 is to be found in the humble poets who, amongst a nation of voiceless singers, found voice for the hopes, and joys, and loves that lay round their hearts. The spirit and tone of the songs of these later writers are peculiar to Ireland, and are characteristic of the race. Before, however, we endeavour to explain the peculiarities of this branch of Irish literature, and briefly consider the condition of Irish poetry at this period, we shall inquire what the bards have done for Irish literature. To the bards, no matter how poorly we esteem them now, the credit is due of having nurtured and perpetuated the poetic instincts of the Irish race. For nearly a thou sand years they were a power in the land second only to the kings and chiefs. They elevated their patron chiefs into heroes ; invented for them elaborate genealogies to show a descent from royal and remote ancestors ; manu factured history and magnified tradition ; and preached a standard of excellence toward which all should strive. They composed and sung their martial songs to incite the warriors to battle, and to assure them of immortal renown when they 'fell fighting fearful odds, for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods.' They made heroes of men and gods of heroes. The eulogiums on kings and heroes were, in Ireland as in ancient Greece, cast into a verse shape by the bards \u2014 as were the laws of the country and the actions of the great men. These versifying records or monodies or historical cadences were recited or sung, and though they were very unpoetic, they satisfied the ear of a people who, dwelling in a pastoral country, had not only the leisure to learn and to sing, but also an artless and frank spirit fitted to admire heroes, and a nature suited for the appreciation of the"], [23, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 9 simple dignity of the warlike odes chanted to them. The war-songs and all the compositions are rather ordinary, judging by a nineteenth-century standard ; but they were designed for no more than to animate the vulgar, and were only of an ephemeral character. They were composed for a sympathetic audience with whom military ardour, glory and fame were summits of ambition, and as such they served their aim ; but as poems, the writers of them never shook themselves free of exaggera tion or emancipated themselves from myth. Magnified exploits of mythical ancestors were considered by the bards as creating the noblest emulation to heroism and bravery. But however stirring they may have been as incentives to uphold the renown of ancient intrepid heroism, they are so abundant in trivialities and absurdities as to be tiresome to the last degree. But though the bards perpetuated the poetic instincts of the nation, and kept alive and intensified the fervour of national feeling which still is strong in the Celtic character, it cannot be said that they or their works have had any effect whatsoever on the later poetic literature of the country. Indeed, notwithstanding Hardiman and Walker and Miss Brooke, it is a small loss, and one little to be regretted, that the majority of their ' poems ' have gone irrevocably and irretrievably down the stream of Time into the great ocean of Oblivion. The so-called historical poems of which they were the fathers, were no more than metrical records, which to judge from the remains were mere prose of a very ordinary, not to say bald, character. This seems somewhat anomalous in a nation that had earned a reputation for an epigrammatic style and that was early renowned for its poetic powers, and in a race to which so unfriendly a critic as Mommsen"], [24, "10 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. allows a most decided talent for poetry. Yet, though the annals of the country are full of events which could have supplied all the elements for historical epics, full of dramatic action, of love and war, of feasting and mourn ing, of fidelity and treachery, of moving incidents of all descriptions, still the bardic literature is singularly deficient in this respect. Later song-writers have indeed caught the spirit of some of the early historical incidents ; but whether it is because of the want of the power of sus tained effort, or from some other cause, these events are subjects for songs only \u2014 are condensed into a few verses, whereas they are large and wide enough for an epic or a drama. In regard to immortalising the salient episodes of the history of the land, a Maclise has served us better even than a Moore. The bards and their works are altogether disappointing, and they possess no human interest to any of this generation, except antiquaries and the like \u2014 not even to the most patriotic Place the work of the best of the early bards in comparison with such early poetry as that of the entire book of Job, and see how insignificant and jejune the literary remains of these royally-honoured poets are. They themselves, high as their estate was and great the honours paid to them, were unable to maintain a pre-eminence and dignity which were primarily based on their poetic powers. They became degraded and even hateful occasionally. Old Keating in his wonderful 'History of Ireland' says once of them, while yet they were an institution : ' These professors were become very chargeable to the inhabitants, and being of a covetous disposition were a grievance insupportable to the people ; and upon account of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by these versifiers from the indulgence of former"], [25, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 11 kings, a third part of the whole kingdom passed under the notion of poets, and professed themselves regular members of that society : for it was a plausible cover to idleness and ease, it being ordained by law that they should be supported by other men's labours, and billeted upon the people throughout the island from All Hallow tide till May.' It was worth one's while to be a poet in Ireland in those days. On the whole, then, it is perhaps best that the works of these ' professors ' are to a large extent lost, and themselves forgotten. What of theirs we have, does not make us desirous for more. The copious, bold, and expressive language of old Ireland was admirably adapted for poetry \u2014 was even in itself a poetry \u2014 and it was used for inflated nothings, and not for undying words. The country's literature owes little to the bards, and to them the song-writers owe nothing what soever. Bardism proper \u2014 that is, when the bard held his office by hereditary right, and was of the chief's household \u2014 in its decline produced a poor literature. It had lost its eloquence, its fire was quenched; there was little of heroism in it \u2014 it had reached a very low estate. As an illustration of the latest bardic effusions, and as an argu ment for our confining ourselves to the songs and song writers, to the exclusion of the bards, we will give a specimen of the poetry of Bard Teige MacDaire Mac- Brody, one who was in his day (circa 1570 \u2014 1640) an eminent person in his profession. He was chief bard to Donough O'Brien, fourth Earl of Thomond, from whom, after the ancient custom, he held as his appanage the castle and lands of Dunogan in Clare. To him is due the ' Contention of the Bards,' which is a series of so called poems, the sequel of a debate between him and"], [26, "12 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Bard O'Clery, on a subject of vital interest then, we sup pose, but of none now, except to the arch\u00e6ologian and historian. He \u2014 determined to elevate the house of O'Brien, whom he served, above the tribes descended from the great Niall of the Nine Hostages, to wit, the O'Neills, O'Donnells, etc. \u2014 ' attacked the works of Torna Eigeas, the last of the heathen bards.' The method of vindication may seem to us peculiar, but O'Clery, the hereditary bard of the disparaged septs, took up the battle on behalf of Torna. MacDaire replied and O'Clery rejoined ; and soon, in genuine Irish fashion, the fray became general, and almost all the bards within the four seas of Ireland got into the poetic scrimmage. The contest ran to seed \u2014 wore itself out, leaving no conclusion or judgment on Torna to solve the anxious perplexity of future ages. We may mention that MacDaire perished, in his old age, rather ingloriously for an hereditary bard who had been counsellor to the kingly O'Brien. He was flung over a precipice during the Cromwellian wars by one who, with brutal and unpoetic malice, accompanied the murderous act with a cruel taunt, 'Go say your verses now, my little man ;' a sad fate truly. In his capacity as Laureate to Thomond he was in duty bound to greet his chieftain upon election with a bardic poem \u2014 that is, one full of the praise and glory of the chiefs ancestors, and with some advice, half didactic and half flattering, to rule so as to maintain that glory undimmed and undiminished. From one of these odes the following lines are selected as a sample of the poetry of the latest hereditary bards, the remnants of an institution that had flourished with various degrees of pride and honour for its thousand years. Having pointed out the responsibilities of king ship and the power of a king for good and ill (though"], [27, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 13 Thomond was not a king) ; having inculcated pious exer cises and daily prayers 'to Him whom glory veils above the skies ;' having assured O'Brien that from God alone redress for anxious cares was to be sought ; having animadverted on the immorality and scandal of corrupt and unjust judgments, and the advantage and honour of ' pious decisions ;' having given instruction (hardly needed) on the chiefs bearing and conduct in war, Mac- Daire MacBrody goes on to say : ' Though numerous precepts still I could unfold For thy sure guidance, yet will I withhold, Reserved my further counsel \u2014 for imprest Be this just maxim deep upon thy breast, Instruction briefly given is the best. I will not, till my footsteps you pursue, Praise thy fair limbs, or frame of fulgent hue ; Nor round, strong knee, and limbs well formed and fair Nor tapering active foot, alert as air ; Nor liberal soul, majestic, great and good, Prompt, fearless, brave, impetuous as the flood, Undaunted, firm, with native valour fired, For prowess, might, and steadiness admired ; Facetious \u2014 mild as zephyr's gentle flow \u2014 Nor ever furious but against the foe. Yet will I praise \u2014 nor will my voice alone Be raised to celebrate thy great renown. If thou fulfil the purport of my lays From lettered source derived of wisdom's ways, The glorious sun shall spread thy praises round, And feathered songsters warble the sweet sound ; Each element beneath high heaven's expanse, Earth, water, air, will in full choir advance To sing in strain sublime that ne'er will die, Thy beaming sprightly animated eye.' This must have been a peculiar eye indeed that required the sun, and the birds, with earth, water, and air, in full chorus, to sing it. He goes on : ' The hum of bees will murmur o'er the woods, And sportive trouts will wanton through the floods ; And e'en the sea-calves their deep tones will raise At once with me, to celebrate thy praise.'"], [28, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 14 On the occasion of this ode it is to be presumed that the bard was in too solemn a frame to joke, but it is difficult to suppress a smile at his hope that the sea calves will join him in a bass chorus in praise of his master and patron. MacDaire was in parts of this ode practical enough, and he is pious all throughout. But is it not sorry stuff? Is it not as unpoetic an ode as ever bard or no bard sung? Its wisdom is most heavy and commonplace \u2014 its tediousness is superlative and intoler able, though with ingenuous candour he confesses that ' Instruction briefly given is the best.' Could it be imagined that this style of thing could have stimulated an O'Brien or anyone else to the extent the fond bard hoped? There is much of this at hand in Irish bardic literature of those days. This is a mere instance, and is inserted here as a warning to latter-day readers to avoid the bards, and as an argument for leaving them buried in the centuries with their Odes and ' Contentions ' heaped high and solid above them. There are however, happily, interesting compositions in the records of the country's literature, but it is not to the hereditary bards we look for them. There are songs sprinkled over a period of about four hundred years which are not commonplace or tedious, maudlin or in tolerable, and most of which are as fresh and full of interest to-day as when they were sung. The song-com posers began to write in English between two and three centuries ago ; but there are many written before this time in the native language, which have been translated during the present century ; and of these songs, original and in translations, of dead Celtic Irish singers, the best lie between the years embraced in this volume, 1600 \u2014 1S70. It has been remarked that the tone and spirit of"], [29, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 15 these songs are peculiar to Ireland, and are characteristic of the Celtic race; and it is worth a brief while to examine the peculiar and exceptional traits, and show what con dition, poetically, Ireland was in at this period. Though there have been some true poets of Irish descent and birth, there has not been one great one. There is not in the entire literature of the country a great epic like the '\u00c6neid ' or the ' Divina Commedia,' a great tragedy like ' Hamlet ' or 'Lear;' not even an ethic poem. The reasons for these facts are not difficult to determine. One of the characteristics of the Celt is an incapacity for sustained effort and continuous application \u2014 two elements essential to the production of a great work of either description. The conditions of existence in Ireland in the earlier years of what we may call its modern literature have been adverse to the fostering of those qualities which make for a great poet or great dramatist, even had the disposition of the race rendered it capable of striving and attaining to such eminences : legislative oppression and repression from abroad ; perpetual crusades of spoliation and extermination ; increasing and incurable turmoil, turbulence, and bloodshed ; *an education, if it did exist, of the most meagre, narrow, and restricted description, stunted by prohibitions and insane enact ments \u2014 all contributed to the annihilation of a poetic spirit and the quenching of a poetic fire. Yet, under all these difficult conditions, the spirit survived though it languished, and the fire did not die though it paled. The Celtic nature, prone to that melancholy which is the true root of pure sentiment, found solace throughout in poetic outpourings of a pathetic patriotism. The nation cherished a love of their country for its natural beauty, for the kindly hospitality of its children, for the tenderness"], [30, "16 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. of its domestic relations, for its simple homely legends, for its ancient clannish fidelities, for its old sweet melodies, for its faith-full pious deeds. The melancholy spirit found food in the contemplation of its ruined abbeys and churches, consecrated by the pious memories of countless ages, yet transformed by the ravages of Time and the brutal profanity of war into dreary howling Golgothas. This love of country is a chief trait of Irish songs. Love itself \u2014 human love for the Kathleens and Brideens, the ' colleens ' and ' Gal machrees,' frequently humorous, always tender and true \u2014 is the foremost characteristic, as it should be, amongst a people of whom Grattan said, 'Their genius is affection.' The jovial rollicking qualities of the race are displayed in drinking and feast songs ; and then the Irish poetry, properly so called, of the period we have chosen, is exhausted. No epics with a trace of the fire of Homer, of the grandeur of Dante, of the majesty of Milton, are to be found ; no descriptive poems like 'Childe Harold ;' no satires like the Dunciad. The Irish poets were song-writers, and were poets of the human passions. That all might appreciate they sung in songs that all could learn, to the old melodies that all could sing, and had sung from their childhood. Cynicism, satire, and sarcasm are almost entirely absent. These are complex arts, and the Irish song-writers had mastered only the elementary arts of simplicity and fidelity to nature. Thus the songs go straight to the heart, in a homely fashion, with a kindly tenderness. Their stock subject was poor, oppressed Erin, so love able, withal her robes of sorrow and mourning ; to her they never forgot to manifest and declare their fidelity, as they do to her dark-eyed maidens and her brave sons. The love of country is not of the heroic and warlike, but"], [31, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 17 of the pathetic and sentimental type ; and therefore the songs are chiefly marked by a melancholy repining re trospectiveness, which hugs past glories and cherishes the renown and remembrance of past greatness and happiness. The future is not a subject for song so much as the past ; and when the poet does project himself into the future, he but lights it up with a faint and faltering ray of hope. As Fate had brought Erin down from her high estate, and caused her to sit in the dust, discrowned amongst the nations, begirt in sackcloth, so in Fate was reposed the hope and trust of regeneration, and of a return to the bright happiness of the old legendary life. The independent energy and aggressive boldness essential to a patriotism of action had been crushed out of the Irish soul by harassing, cruel oppression, and the feelings that should have culminated in action found vent in dispiriting but sweet lamentations. Perhaps the ' melan choly ocean ' was the causa causans of this sinking under oppression ; but the people sunk, broken-spirited. There are no heroic songs with the warlike ring of arms to awaken, as in old days, the sons of the oppressed to deeds of prowess ; and if there were, they would have been sung in vain. A Davis in later years, and no Celtic Irish poet, awoke the martial lyre from its long sleep. The love of country is with the song-writers like a human endearment, an affection that is for ever casting ' longing, lingering looks behind' into the past days when their kings were conquerors, and Malachi wore the collar of gold that he won from the proud invader. The patriotism may be a poor patriotism, but from its very helplessness and fidelity it deserves more than mere esteem or praise. Patriotism was proscribed, but love was left to them ; and so the rebellious hopings and dark 2"], [32, "18 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. complainings are woven round the name of a loved one. Thus we have the personification of Ireland under the name of a woman, and the inculcation of nationality under the guise of a love-song, \u2014 a frequent device of the song-writers. The singers will idealise and magnify the glory of the past, and ruminate and realise it in its exaggeration, and sit down in the dust and weep. The dark and doleful side is always upturned, as in hard truth it well may be. What Davis said of the music applies to the patriotic songs also \u2014 ' they are too full of tears.' The regrets are admittedly futile, the longings admittedly vain ; and although bitter, almost savage, hatred of the devastator Saxon is unforgotten, it still is impotent It is but clanking the iron that has entered into the soul ; it is but furious fuming against the irresistible and irre mediable. There is no sharpening of spears and brighten ing of swords ; no incitement to a grand tempest-rush to freedom or death. The anger is confined to lamentations and imprecations. The spirit may be willing, but the flesh is weak. Yet it is to be observed that there is no inculcation of treachery ; no counselling to conspire in deceit. Broken and wounded, helpless and inert, they in their songs raged and sighed, dreamed dreams ' that did not wait for sleep.' The Celtic race, as far as Ireland was concerned, was now in hard reality 'one of the beaten nations of the earth.' This patriotism, such as it is, was and is the paramount sentiment in the Irish breast. It dominates over the religious sentiment. Thus it is with Emmet, Fitzgerald, Tone, Grattan, Smith O'Brien, Butt, Mr. Parnell, and others ; though they belonged to an alien and hated creed, nevertheless the masses rose with almost one accord to flock to their standard, because upon it was inscribed, vaguely but"], [33, "THE IRISH EARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 19 comprehensive!}', the one word 'Ireland.' This word was at once a confession of doctrine and an appeal, to which even religion itself was subordinate. The people did not pause to consider who it was assumed the patriotic apostleship : the stripling or the veteran, the wise or wild, the novice or the adept, the Celt or the settler \u2014 of the old faith or the alien creed \u2014 it was im material. They were fain to follow anyone who, qualified or unqualified, proclaimed himself a leader, and stood forth with a project, practicable or impracticable, to clothe with some reality the intangible and cloudlike sentiment which was ever supreme within them. This sentimental fidelity is the ruling characteristic of the Celtic Irish. The love-songs and songs of the affections were during this period what they ever were in Irish literature, full of simplicity, tenderness, and elegance, full of the true language of the true heart. Even in bardic times these were frequently of unusual excellence. The turgid bom bast and preposterous exaggeration of the odes and war songs were absent from the love-songs. Then, as in later times, these were marked by a peculiar, tender melan choly, a genuine pathos, a suppressed humour, that we seek in vain in the love-songs of other nations. In them virtue is extolled, as valour is extolled in the war-songs: the poets deal with the human passions which were their everyday observations ; they wrote of true feelings which many should experience and all could comprehend ; and their excellence lies in the fact that truth and nature were the well-springs of their muse. There is no striving after effect, no adherence to fashion-codes, no hypocrisies. There is no mawkish sentimentality. All is of the heart, hearty, and of the home, homely. They are the best 2 \u2014 2"], [34, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 20 portion of the country's literature. They are the charm of Irish poetry. They ' dwell in reality,' and thus, accord ing to Mr. Carlyle, contain the essence of permanence. There is nothing foreign or impossible in them, nothing untrue to nature or humanity. The 'boys' are the same, and the ' colleens ' the same in the nineteenth century as they were in the seventeenth. Those songs written a few centuries ago are as fresh and as real as those written to day. They are full of goodness and beauty, are bright and abiding. The ineffable tenderness, the gentle re proachings, or the irresistible coaxings ; the utter freedom from immodesty or indecorum ; the familiar but respect ful sentiment ; the sympathetic melodies \u2014 these and the eternal qualities of truth and reality will preserve them to literature and humanity as long as the sun and moon endure. The convivial songs differ from others of a similar description, in that though they are wholly in praise of the bowl, not for any sentimentality, but because it affords the very material delight of getting drunk, they are never coarse or indecent. If it be true that the songs of a people are the truest indication and surest test of the nature and disposition of the people, the songs of Ireland will demonstrate that the Irish were a convivial race, with hearts always susceptible to the tender passion, and minds ever full of a love of country and hatred of the invader. But the conviviality is never half-hearted \u2014 no sentiment of depression or disappointment can attach to the bottle. The festal songs are full of enjoyment of the present, and \u2014 undisturbed by care or thought of the morrow \u2014 they insist on joviality. Reckless, hilarious profusion is enforced \u2014 no stint, no half measures, no approach to temperance is tolerated. But the drink is indulged in,"], [35, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 21 not for base motives, but because it is good, it makes friendship stronger and life altogether pleasanter ; not for brutal gluttony, but because it exhilarates and cheers. Comical excuses for excess are ever ready, but the grosser motives and the consequences of over-indulgence are never dwelt on. Though, therefore, from a political point of view the Celtic nations may have, in a critic's words, ' proved them selves useless,' from a poetical point of view the Irish branch of the race is by no means so. The qualities that endowed them with a poetic disposition, the extreme susceptibility, the impetuosity and fervour, the vividness of fancy and sympathetic imagination, rendered them in capable of being great poets, for these qualities were over-compensated by a want of perseverance, the inca pacity to maintain a steady self-reliance, the unenduring nature of their impressions and resolutions, the lack of industry, the tendency to melancholy inaction. Thus we have sweet airs, but no oratorios ; thrilling lyrics, but no epic : tender songs, but few dramas. The assertion, therefore, that the Irish were at all times a poetic nation is but half true. They were poetical in that they possessed the deep poetic glow ; that is to say, the mental ingredients that go to make a poet. But they possessed it mostly in silence, and sought not for the lesser glory of poetic fame. Poets, in the sense of creators or seers, they were not. In vain we seek dis tinctive periods with distinguishing characteristics in their poetic literature. The Celtic mind in its songs and poetry, as in most things, has ever been conservative. The poetry of to-day has the same features, the same methods of thought, is urged by the same influences that"], [36, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 22 marked it in days gone by. It has also, at all events in later times, a fugitive, half-furtive tone about it. It has not by a new departure shaped or influenced the coming literature, however much it had an influence in maintain ing the character and traits of the people. The poets and song-writers of the period we have chosen \u2014 which in another country and under other conditions would have been a Renaissance period \u2014 were, for the most part, obscure persons, of whom little is recorded and little known. Of many of them, of the place and time of birth, of the mode of life, of the manner and date of death \u2014 absolutely nothing is known of a certainty ; much is conjectural, much apocryphal. The materials for the construction of their biographies are either non-existent or of the scantiest. The singers emerge from obscurity, sing their songs \u2014 one or more of which by chance, or be cause of real merit, are snatched from oblivion \u2014 and pass on into the eternities, unwept, unhonoured, and unsung. Many may have deserved immortality, but they never at tained it; they may have followed after Fame, but they never, in their lifetime, overtook her. But with all these disadvan tages, notwithstanding all the oppression and hunting-down of which they were the victims, though they themselves are wrapt in gloom and darkness, the songs shine out brightly. These heart-outpourings were a consolation and a solace to them and their little world in their affliction ; and because of their artlessness and naturalness they have not lost their power to please the generations that come after them. They have none of the melodious luscious ness of a Swinburne, none of the etherialism of a Shelley, none of the dignity of a Tennyson, none of the majesty of a Byron, but they have a sweetness and tender elo quence, a coyness and a pathos, a pureness and un-"], [37, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 23 affectedness, a light-hearted sentimentality, which are not found so constantly, or not found at all, in the songs of other peoples. The songs, whether of love, or patriotic, or convivial, come from the heart, appeal to the heart, and dwell in the heart ; they are intensely human. It is because of these qualities, rather than because of literary merit, that they are ever fresh and that they deserve to be known, remembered and sung by the sons of the people for whom they first were sung. The deficiency in literary merit is easily accounted for. Not only is it to be remembered that there were no facilities or means of literary education, but, even if there had been, the majority of these poets made their songs for their own time and their own people. The chief aim was to gain and maintain a contemporary popularity and fame, and not a fame amongst posterity. The preservation of many of their compositions is accidental, and due, not to the composer's industry and care, but to the care of friends and admirers and to tradition. The songs may remain, but, as we have said, the writers are mere shadows, nonentities to us. Their names are strange and unfamiliar ; their lives are deep in the dark. They are obscurities on the whole, and on the whole they did not rise to a high literary level. Because of these circumstances, and because of the entire paucity of poets who might be esteemed as great poets, we find a Thomas Moore unduly magnified and belauded until he is made to seem as great as his poet contemporaries. We also find that compilers and col lectors of Irish literature claim as Irish writers numbers who have no title whatsoever to be so regarded. The exigencies of an editor perhaps compel him to this course; for Celtic-Irish literature cannot provide a very brilliant"], [38, "24 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. collection of writings, and therefore Anglo-Irish writers, and writers who were in no sense Irish or part Irish, are pressed into the service. Perhaps it is a pardonable vanity to claim such as Irish, and to make boast of them ; it is hero-worship, though of a distorted and selfish de scription. Thus we find Swift and Sterne, Congreve and Farquhar, ' Cooper Hill Denham ' and Steele, and a multitude of minor literati, set down in our collections of Irish authors. For this there is no other reason than that the mothers of these happened to be on Irish soil when they gave birth to them. These names may be surrendered with reluctance, but Ireland has no claim on them. Goldsmith, Davis, Lover, Lever, and numerous others, are not Celtic-Irish, but Anglo-Irish; and they and their songs will form a second series of this work. This volume deals only with song-writers of the Celtic-Irish race ; for we are satisfied that their songs, be they for gotten or famous, are sufficiently interesting to be col lected, sufficiently meritorious and characteristic to be read and studied, sufficiently gay and humorous to be re membered, and sufficiently melodious, pure, tender, and pathetic to touch the hearts and affections of all readers, even in this commercial and ' costermonger age.' There are a few considerations to be noted in regard to those whose biographies are here briefly given. With the exception of the Sheridan family, all the Celtic-Irish song writers are of immediately humble birth. We say ' im mediately humble,' for possibly they were all descendants of ancestors who, in remote mythical ages, or even later, were kings, or chiefs, or hereditary bards. But in Irish poet biographies there are no Surreys, or Buckhursts, or Byrons, or Swinburnes \u2014 no aristocratic writers, in fact. From the peasant class, or a social grade but one degree above it,"], [39, "THE IRISH BARDS AND SONG-WRITERS. 25 Irish song-writers are taken. Nor is this to be wondered at, when it is remembered that the Irish nobles and chiefs, before they were plundered, exiled, or extermi nated, filled their days with sterner pursuits than the study and fosterage of polite literature. As long as bards were an institution, it was their office to make and recite poetry ; and harpers were in permanent service to play and sing. The extinction of bardism was simul taneous with the extinction of the Irish aristocracy. There was not either a middle class in Ireland. After the Elizabethan settlement the native Irish were, on the whole, reduced to a condition of serfdom, were made ' hewers of wood and drawers of water ;' in fact, the Irish nation became, between Elizabeth and Cromwell, a nation of peasants. Their own language was proscribed, and the conditions attached to learning the English language were intolerable to them. The wonder, therefore, is, not that these singers should have been peasants, but that there were any singers at all : and having sung, that they should have sung so well and truly. In the ancient days the bards were of the kin of princes, were rewarded with lands and castles, were circled with privileges, were re garded with a sacred awe. But in the later days those who made songs enjoyed no privileges, but struggled through countless difficulties, and emancipated them selves from disheartening drawbacks ; they received no rewards, were humble and poor. Of the song-writers whose lives are briefly recorded in this volume, the majority were directly the sons of peasants, or a little better ; which fact considering, and considering also the wretched means for a fugitive and, at best, elementary education which were alone accessible to them, the productions of these Irish song-writers are marvellous for their poetic"], [40, "26 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. power, their purity, and truth. The long neglect in which they have been held is a proof of the truth of Johnson's opinion \u2014 ' Slow rises worth by poverty depressed.' There is another consideration that will force itself upon any who take the trouble of perusing the biographies, such as they are, of these singers. That is, the uniform sadness, unhappiness, and wretchedness of the lives of almost all of them. We are oppressed with the feeling that the times were always out of joint with them. Most of them died young, after a life-struggle of penury and hardship, counting death, doubtless, as ' kind Nature's signal for retreat' Many of them could not shake off the demon of intemperance. In disease and poverty, ill in mind and body, the majority of them existed ; with out honour in their own country ; their talents unrecog nised and unrewarded. There is not over the mortal remains of several of them even a stone to mark who rests beneath. Posthumous fame is no consolation to those who, in their life-time, struggled and hungered ; but if they have left to their country songs that give pleasure, and that show them to have been something above the common herd, their country might preserve their names, make familiar their songs, and endeavour to bestow on them a little fame, faltering and feeble though it be."], [41, "THE CELTIC IRISH SONG-WRITERS, 1600 \u2014 1S70. Biographical and Critical, KEATING. Geoffry Keating is in these days better remembered as an historian than as a poet, though, to do him justice, his poetry is somewhat more readable than his ' History of Ireland.' Both are patriotic ; but whereas in the songs transcribed in this volume we discover the usual subjects, the usual tone of lamentation, the usual sorrowful love for the motherland \u2014 characteristics fully intelligible and ap preciable \u2014 in the ' History of Ireland ' each page is full of absurd traditions, impossible legends, preposterous chro nologies, ridiculous genealogies, ludicrous miracles, extra ordinary wars.

But in his poetry he is human and rational. His epitaph records that he was ' a poet, a prophet, and a priest,' from which it would appear that his fame as an historian was left for later ages to discover. Very little is known of his earlier years. It is generally accepted that he was born at Tybrud, or Tubbrid, near Clogheen. in the county Tipperary, some time about 1570. In his youth he was sent to Spain, and, at the college of Salamanca, studied for the priest hood for twenty-three years. He was, on his return in 1 6 10, appointed priest of his native parish of Tybrud. He was a man of varied attainments, and, as a divine, was distinguished for his fervent zeal, his blameless life, and his fervid eloquence. That he must have been benevolent, amiable, and tolerant, is made manifest by the recorded circumstance that the Protestants of the neigh bourhood contributed towards the expenses of the building of his church ; and that he was a fearless pastor is proven by the event that drove him into exile, a fugitive and a recluse. In discharge of his sacred functions he excom municated, some say, others say he merely preached against, a lady, 'a gentleman's wife,' who was believed to be too familiar with the Lord-President of Munster. In all times, but especially in those times in Ireland, the re compence of such temerity as this act of excommunicating the favourite of the ruler of the province, was persecution, and thus Keating's life was endangered to such a degree, that, to avoid apprehension and punishment, he fled from his parish and hid himself in the glen of Aherlow, which lies between the town of Tipperary and the Galtee Moun tains. There his ' History ' was begun, and perhaps his poems and songs written ; and there he remained till 1633, the year that Sir George Carew, the offended Lord-"], [43, "KEATING. 29 President, had been recalled to England. He returned to Tybrud, and, with one Father Eugene Duhy as coad jutor, he there spent the remainder of his useful and laborious life. There he died, in 1644, and there, over the porch of the church that he built, and where he and Duhy ministered, in rather eccentric lettering, is the following inscription : ' Ora.te, prOAebq. P.

MACWARD. Of Owen MacWard, or Owen Roe MacBhaird, nothing is known beyond that he was the bard of the O'Donnells, and was the descendant of a long line of bards, attached from a remote period to that sept* He fled with O'Donnell and O'Neil, the Earls of Tyrowen and Tyr connell, from Ireland in 1607, and his chief poem is his ' Lament ' for them, at their decease. They died and were buried in Rome, and the elegy was addressed to Nuala, the sister of O'Donnell of Tyrconnell. It is a poem entirely charged with the national spirit and senti ment of the time \u2014 a record of the great deeds of the noble princes, a wail of grief for poor Erin, a pathetic appeal to God to ' sustain us in these doleful days, and render light the chain that binds our fallen land.' We give the translation of this noble ode, by Mangan, and it will be readily conceded that it is a poem that merits the encomiums passed on it by modem critics. It is a mournful song of triumph, a proud, heroic elegy, soaked through and through with the languishment of a hopeless hope, an utter and incurable grief for the ' hapless fate ' of Ireland. Entirely spirit-broken, there is no whisper of revenge, no anticipation of recovery. The only consolation he can offer to the bereaved Nuala is painfully hopeless : ' Thou daughter of O'Donnell ! dry Thine overflowing eyes, and turn Thy heart aside ; For Adam's race is born to die, And sternly the sepulchral urn Mocks human pride.' * MacBhaird means the Son of the Bard, and has been Anglicised into MacWard and Ward."], [45, "MACWARD \u2014 O'DUGAN. 31 This is no sentimentalism, no unreal woe, assumed for effect ; it is the drops wrung from a crushed and broken heart, an utterly sad and hopeless grief.

Maurice O'Dugan, or Dugan, is remembered because he wrote ' The Coolin,' setting the words to an air ' the finest in the whole circle of Irish music,' which, like almost all the Irish melodies, dates from such a remote period that the composer is unknown ; and which is familiar to everyone in this nineteenth century. O'Dugan, it is asserted, upon what evidence we know not, was de scended, like Ward, from a race of hereditary bards (there was a John O'Dugan, chief bard of The O'Kelly in Connaught, who wrote a topograpical poem, and died about 1370); but of himself and his other writings nothing is known except that they were and are not He appears to have lived near historic Benburb, sometime about 1640, but where and whence he came, and when and whither he departed, are in the blackest darkness."], [46, "32 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. In this respect he is not worse than many of his fellows, than many greater than he. But his love-song, 'The Coolin,' has rescued his name from the gloom, and should preserve it DUFFET. Thomas Duffet was a writer of burlesques and of songs. Of his half-dozen dramatic burlesques, it is acknowledged that they were favourably received and somewhat suc cessful in his own day, though no one except readers of extinct literature know or care about them now. He burlesqued Dryden and Shadwell, and others of minor note \u2014 presumption which was attended with general de nunciation. ' Mr. Duffet,' say his biographers, ' stood more indebted to the great names of those authors whose works he attempted to burlesque and ridicule, than to any merit of his own.' But the originals, like the burlesques, are little thought of now ; and a Renaissance, when Dryden and Settle and Shadwell will as dramatists be too great and high to be burlesqued, has yet to dawn. What ever his abilities and powers of ridicule may have been, his talent for song-writing will at all times be acknow ledged. ' Come all you pale Lovers,' and ' Since C\u0153lia's my Foe,' are excellent in their way, and, like all he wrote, bear evidence of the influence of the English literature of the time, and are without the distinguishing spirit of Celtic poetry. Of his birth or death nothing is known. All that is recorded of him is that he was an Irishman who originally owned a milliner's shop in the New Ex change, London, and subsequently devoted his talents to literature. Possibly he was a Duffy in his native land, who in London Anglicised his name and forgot his country, as others have done. He is generally supposed"], [47, "DUFFET \u2014 O'NAGHTEN. 33 to have lived about 1650 \u2014 1700, but his biographers were so zealous to extinguish him for his daring in ridiculing the then literary gods, that they refused to honour him with a record of his birth or parentage. O'NAGHTEN. John O'Naghten, or O'Neachtan, holds, according to Hardiman in his ' Irish Minstrelsy,' ' the same rank in Irish literature that Young, the author of \"Night Thoughts,\" occupies in English. With equal genius and learning the Irish bard's compositions are more equal (sic) and correct, and his style less diffuse, than those of the favoured English author.' Hardiman had more mate rials for forming a judgment than we have, for he had in his possession a copious treatise in Irish, by the bard, on geography, 'extending to nearly five hundred closely written pages, and containing many interesting particu lars ;' and also O'Naghten's ' Collection of Curious Annals of Ireland, from a.d. 1167 to the beginning of the seven teenth century.' But from the remains of O'Naghten's works now accessible to the English reader \u2014 from his ' Maggy Laidir ' and his ' Lament on Queen Mary ' (D'Este), we think a more complimentary judgment might, without injustice, be passed on the poet Of his ' Maggy Laidir,' Hardiman says : ' This inimitable description of an Irish feast was written in the seventeenth century by John O'Neachtan, and is now printed from a transcript made in the year 1706 . . .In point of composition, \" Maggy Laidir \" is superior to \" O'Rorke's Feast,\" so humorously translated by Dean Swift. Here the chairman only speaks through out. His first toast is old Ireland, under the name of \"Maggy Laidir \" ; then the beauteous daughters of Erin ; the.ancient families of the four provinces, Leinster, Munster, Ulster, and Connaught ; the clergy who have been always dear to the Irish ; and finally he wishes disappointment to the foes, and success to the friends of the 3"], [48, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 34 country. After these libations he becomes a little gay, and must have music. He calls on the harpers to strike up. Finally a quarrel, more Thracian, ensues, which our elevated chairman, in the true Irish style of commanding peace, orders to be quelled by knocking down the combatants ; and he concludes by alluding to his noble ancestry and kindred to enforce his claim to respect and obedience. The air, as well as the words of \"Maggy Laidir,\" though long naturalised in North Britain, is Irish The name signifies, in the original, strong or powerful Maggy, and by it was meant Ireland, also designated by our bards under the names of Granua Weale, Roisin Dubh, Sheelah na Guira, etc. By an easy change the adjective \"laidir,\" strong, was converted into Lauder, the patronymic of a Scotch family, and the air was employed to celebrate a famous courtesan of Crail.' As usual, of the personal history of the bard, next to nothing has been ascertained. He lived in the later part of the seventeenth century, and was a native of Meath. These two facts exhaust his biography. He was an in dustrious collector and compiler, and is supposed to have died young. CAROLAN. The name of Turlough O'Carolan, ' the last of the Irish bards,' stands out pre-eminent in the annals of Irish song as that of a man the record of whose life is worth read ing ; as a composer whose music is fresh, vigorous, and appropriate to to-day ; and as a songster whose love poems and drinking-songs command as great a pleasure and satisfaction now as they did nearly two centuries ago, when, a blind itinerant harper, he roamed from place to place, delighting and enthralling the high and low, the rich and poor, with his own songs, sung to his own music, played by himself on his Irish harp. Pathetic and humorous, sad and facetious, melancholy and rollicking \u2014 a Celtic genius \u2014 he sang himself through a long life, enjoying the friendship, hospitality, and protection of the great ; and drank himself out of it, having practised what"], [49, "CAROLAN. 35 he preached, and manifested, in word and deed, a faithful love for the native and national drink. Carolan, though his father was a cottier and his mother the daughter of a peasant, was descended from an ancient family of Meath, in which county there is a place still called Carolan's Town, a partial evidence that the family was once of some importance \u2014 were at all events of a better class than peasantry. He was born, according to some biographers, at Nobber, in the county Westmeath ; but the better opinion is that his birthplace was the village of Baile-nusah, since Anglicised to Newtown, in the same county. He was born about the year 1670, and, as a lad, attended the school at Cruisetown, in county Longford; when and where he formed the acquaintance of Miss Bridget Cruise, and fell in love with her after the manner of a boy. Bridget Cruise, and his love and re membrance of her, ran through his harp-strings all his life. When sixteen or eighteen years of age, he lost his sight through an attack of small-pox, and remained utterly blind ' My eyes,' said he, on his affliction, ' are trans planted to my ears.' About the same time his father moved to Carrick-on-Shannon, and possibly entered into the service of the MacDermott Roe, because we find that Madame MacDermott, attracted by the lad's intelligence, undertook Turlough's education, procured his instruction in English as well as Irish, and had him taught the harp. The old music of his country set his genius in a flame, and ' suddenly, in his twenty-second year, he resolved to become a harper.' ' He became,' says Hardiman, ' a minstrel through accident, and continued it more through choice than necessity.' During his tutelage at Alderford, MacDermott Roe's residence, he developed into an accomplished harpist ; his playing and singing were the 3\u20142"], [50, "36 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. pleasure of his patroness and the delight of her visitors ; and when his sudden resolve to live the life of an itinerant bard was announced, Madame MacDermott provided him with horses for his journeyings and with a boy attendant to carry his harp. Equipped also with genius and reputation, he went forth after the fashion of his antetypes, on a round of visits to the neighbouring Irish gentry, to whom he was already known, and by whom he was already esteemed and appreciated. He did not play for hire ; he was received as a friend and honoured as a welcome guest at the houses he visited in his itinerary ; and, in return for the profuse hospitality of the time and country, he played his own music and sang his own songs of love and of drink, to those who were in sympathy with music, who knew what love and drink were \u2014 and enjoyed all three. ' 'Twas his in their mirth to entrance the throng, Or soothe the lone heart of sorrow,' as an eminent rival brother bard sang of him. In his peregrinations, either impelled by a pardon able vanity to return as a person of some fame and honour to the place where as a youth he moved an insigni ficant school-lad, or attracted by her upon whose beauty, while yet light dwelt in his eyes, he had looked lovingly, he journeyed to Cruisetown in Longford, and visited his child-love, Bridget Cruise. Judging by his poems, it must have been love rather than vanity that directed his steps thither. She, like himself, could sing to her harp playing. In fervid song and earnest prose he spoke his love, but was rejected. To her he says now or subse quently : ' Look on those eyes whence sleep hath flown,'"], [51, "CAROLAN. 37 and whence light had flown too. Poor eyes, punished by Providence, they might be spared punishment by her whose indifference drove sleep from them ! ' My hopes, my thoughts, my destiny, All dwell, all rest, sweet girl, on thee.' And again, with blessings on his lips for her, he says ' Life is not life without thee.' He wandered away, and then, in truth, gave his whole heart and soul to his minstrelsy. He did not die, how ever, and though Bridget Cruise was always a fond memory with him, he found solace for the bitterness of his disappointment in dying poetically for others. For one, Peggy Browne, said to be an ancestress of the Sligo family, he is in equal love-throes, his heart-misery is equally ruinous and intense. ' Oh, dark are my days doomed to be While my heart bleeds in silence and sorrow for thee ; In the green spring of life to the grave I go down, Oh, shield me, and save me, my loved Peggy Browne !' But Peggy was as obdurate to the amorous blind bard as Bridget ; and yet he did not die \u2014 and other girls exercise as potent a charm over him. But he pours out his songs and his ' liquor of life,' and at length marries Mary Maguire, a well-descended lady whom he loves tenderly in spite of her wilfulness, haughtiness, and ex travagance ; gave up his wandering life for her ; built a house at Mosshill, and became what is now described as a gentleman-farmer; lived gaily, and begot a numerous progeny ; and, having spent all his possessions in lavish and promiscuous hospitality, thriftlessness, and extrava gance, he lapsed into poverty, and took again to his harp and his wanderings. His wife remained at Mosshill"], [52, "38 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. with the offspring until her death in 1733 ; an event that cast him into a profound melancholy, which beset him during the few years he survived her. The Lament, or Elegy, which he composed upon her death is sorrow ful and pathetic in the extreme \u2014 even in a translation, which cannot be made to convey the pathos and plain tiveness of the original Irish. His after-life proves the sincerity of his grief. 'Alone I'll wander, and alone endure, Till death restore me to my dear one's side And ceaseless anguish shall her loss deplore, Till age and sorrow join me to the dead.' He continued to roam from castle to castle, and having in 1738, five years after the death of his wife, visited Alderford, the home of his early patrons, he fell ill from excessive drinking and died there. He was buried amongst the MacDermotts, and his grave was in after years rifled, and his skull, which was carried away, found its way into the museum of Sir John Caldwell, of Castle Caldwell, in Fermanagh. His harp is now in the pos session of The O'Conor Don \u2014 another, said also to have been his, is in the Royal Irish Academy \u2014 and the large chair, in which he was wont to sit at Alderford and play and sing and drink, still occupies its old position unre moved. He left six daughters and one son, who was subsequently a teacher of the harp in London. There is a rough but sincere elegy on Carolan by one McCabe, a contemporary and friend, ' a wit but no poet' Hearing that Carolan was at the MacDermott's, McCabe made haste to visit him, not having seen him for some years ; and having arrived at Alderford, in passing through the churchyard, he accosted a peasant, and inquired after Carolan. The man replied by point-"], [53, "CAROLAN. 39 ing to his grave. McCabe, shocked and overwhelmed, tottered to the mound and wept forth his sorrow. He wrote the following elegy, detailing the circumstances, a tribute sad and sincere to the old blind bard : ' I came, with friendship's face, to glad my heart, But sad and sorrowful my steps depart : In my friend's stead a spot of earth was shown, And on his grave my woe-struck eyes were thrown. No more to their distracted sight remained But the cold clay that all they loved contained ; And there his last and narrow bed was made, And the drear tombstone for its covering laid. Alas 1 for this my aged heart is wrung, Grief chokes my voice, and trembles on my tongue ; Lonely and desolate I mourn the dead, The friend with whom my every comfort fled ! There is no anguish can with this compare ; No pains, diseases, suffering, or despair, Like that I feel, while such a loss I mourn, My heart's companion from its fondness torn. Oh, insupportable, distracting grief ! Woe, that through life can never hope relief ! Sweet-singing harp \u2014 thy melody is o'er ! Sweet friendship's voice \u2014 I hear thy sound no more .' My bliss, my wealth of poetry is fled, And every joy, with him I loved, is dead. Alas ! what wonder (while my heart drops blood Upon the woes that drain its vital flood) If maddening grief no longer can be borne, And frenzy sill the breast with anguish torn !' A memorial tablet has been erected in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, to Carolan's memory, on which is the following inscription, underneath a bas-relief represent ing in marble the old man playing on his harp : ' By the desire of Lady Morgan. to the memory of CAROLAN, The Last of the Irish Bards. Obiit a.d. mdccxxxviii. ; \u00c6tatis Su\u00e6 An. lxviii.' The scanty remnants of the life-work of Carolan, as a"], [54, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 40 poet and composer, which remain to us, extort a regret that so much, and possibly the best, of his songs and poems, and of his music, should be lost. His love songs, born of a passion strong and sincere for the time, even if fleeting, and his monody on his wife's death, prove him to have been a true poet. His ' Ode to Whisky ' will immortalise him as a humourist of the true Celtic type ; while his musical compositions, of which a representative one is that to which the song ' Bumper Squire Jones ' is written and sung, will con vince that he was entitled to the praise bestowed on him ' il genio vero delta musica.' Goldsmith, capable to esti mate and appreciate, was unstinted in his praise ; he says that of all the bards Ireland had produced, ' the last and the greatest was Carolan the blind. His songs in general may be compared to those of Pindar, as they have frequently the same flight of imagination.' The few examples of his genius which are extant are the survivals of over two hundred songs \u2014 all of which, ex cept one, were written in his native language, and sung to his own minstrelsy. He himself, too, is more than a shadow on the page of Time ; he is a reality, and there is something to record in a biographical notice. His lowly birth ; his school ; the patronage, interest, and encouragement of Madame MacDermott ; his blindness ; his harpings ; his pious pilgrimage to Patrick's Purgatory ; his marriage ; his convivial and extravagant hospitality ; his house and home ; his bankruptcy ; his dear Mary's death \u2014 are all facts that we grasp and realise in this genius's life. Through all appears a heart large with a love for the girls and the whisky, which could extrude all doleful patriotic repinings. The two ruling passions of his life \u2014 the passion for"], [55, "CAROLAN \u2014 CONCANEN. 41 Music and the passion for Whisky \u2014 were, perhaps, at their strongest in his death. He was always a magni ficent drinker. He composed his music with a bottle and cup at his elbow. He would drink ' whole pints of usquebaugh ' at a sitting. Not long before his death his physician frighted him into sobriety ; but the abstinence produced a melancholy, to relieve which he returned to the bottle. But his ' Liquor of Life ' was a liquor of death to him. When on his deathbed, with a knowledge of the near approach of the end, he called for his harp, and crowned a life of song with a wild and touching 'Farewell to Music,' which, it is said, drew tears from the listeners. It is further narrated by Goldsmith that in his last moments he called for a bowl of usquebaugh, or whisky \u2014 essayed to drink and failed ; but he kissed the bowl lovingly, saying, ' It is hard that two such good old friends should part without a kiss,' and fell back and ex pired A death-scene thoroughly characteristic ! A sub ject for a painting ! Somehow, notwithstanding the drunkenness (which was the only fault of this genial genius), one must like the old man, and leave him with kindly feelings, with perhaps a tender regret. He was an Irishman of the traditional type, who for his age and country, and with his opportunities, deserves to be re garded as a star in Irish literature, and to be seated in no mean seat amongst the immortals. CONCANEN. Of Matthew Concanen's parentage, of the time or place of his birth, of his earlier years, absolutely nothing is known. It is conjectured that he was of the province of Connaught; and as he afterwards became Attorney-"], [56, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 42 General of Jamaica, it is apparent that he was educated for the law and called to the Bar. It is certain that he was an Irishman of Irish descent. The name means, we are told, ' the head of a hound ' \u2014 a nickname which became a surname. He went to London early in life, and lived by political writings which appeared in the London Journal, the British Journal, and the Spcculatist ; he wrote against Pope and Pope's friend Bolingbroke not only in journalistic papers, but published a pamphlet, ' A Supplement to the Profound,' in which he vilified the poet, retailing all the malicious gossip concerning him, and imputing to him conduct most dishonourable and disgraceful. For his latter adventures in literature he was installed in a niche in the ' Dunciad,' and ' damned to everlasting fame.' Amongst those who entered on the 'Dunciad' diving contest where the reward was to be obtained by him who ' the most in love of dirt excelled,' and ' who flings most filth and wide pollutes the stream,' Concanen, ' author of several dull and dead scurrilities,' had a pro minent place and a fair chance of a prize : ' True to the bottom, see Concanen creep, A cold, long-winded native of the deep.' His abilities as a political writer obtained for him, from the Duke of Newcastle, the Attorney-Generalship of Jamaica, whither he went in 1731 ; and for seventeen years he discharged the duties of the office with credit and integrity. Here he realised a large fortune, upon which it was his intention to live out his days in his native country. To this end he returned from Jamaica and arrived in London, en route to Ireland, in January, 1749, where after a few weeks' illness he died of con sumption on the 22nd of January, 1749."], [57, "CONCANEN \u2014 MACDONNELL. 43 The immortality conferred on him by the ' Dunciad,' and by Warburton's letter upon him, would never have been his on account of his own political and dramatic writings. Some of his songs, however, have the elements of popularity in them, and deserve to be reprinted. His play of 'Wexford AVells ' can still be read, and his ballad-opera 'The Jovial Crew,' adapted from Broome's play, enjoyed a considerable success in his day. When he was still a very young man, apparently, he wrote a large number of songs, of various degrees of merit, which were published in 1724, with poems by others, in a volume entitled ' Miscellaneous Poems by Several Hands.' He is humorous and satirical, witty and boisterous, with little pathos, and less grace. He is hardly Celtic in the quality of his attributes, but worse songs than his are unforgotten. MACDONNELL. Hardiman pronounces John MacDonnell, called Claragh, as a poet to be the equal of Pope \u2014 a verdict as unjust and derogatory to MacDonnell as it well could be. Pope was at best a cold-blooded philosopher, moralist, and satirist in verse ; MacDonnell was full of the pathos and fancy and fire of impetuous poetic genius. In him all the dis tinguishing characteristics of the Celtic genius abound. He loves his ' Old Erin ' with melancholy, passionate affection, because Fate has oppressed her, and she is beautifuL He says : ' The very waves that kiss the caves Clap their huge hands in glee, That they should guard so fair a sward As Erin by the sea. ' He was a Jacobite, not so much because the Pretender"], [58, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 44 claimed or deserved his homage, but rather because the Pretender and himself were objects of the relentless hate of the common persecutor : a common sorrow begot sympathy. Thus his lament for ' My Hero ! my C\u00e6sar ! my Chevalier!' though it represents in rich hyperbole a whole nation's grief for the ' youth of their love,' the keynote of the lament is 'that he should be banished by a rightless foe.' In the Pretender there were some faint hopes of a possible freedom. He was against the right less foe, and so were all the children of ' Old Erin by the sea.' With him they were ready to make common cause against the common oppressor; partly from an exaggerated idea of his prowess as a military leader and his personal lovableness, but chiefly because in him lay the sole hope of Erin's return to a state of happiness and content, such as she enjoyed ere her warlike sons betrayed her, when she knew not the yoke of the foreign tyrant An ardent Jacobite, a bard inspiring a dispirited race in whom the down-trodden fire of rebellion was ever ready to blaze out, he was an object for exceptional suppression by the English, and had frequently to fly for his life, and roam amongst his native mountains. He was born near Charleville, in the county Cork, in 1 69 1, and he died in 1754, and was buried in the churchyard of Ballyslough, near where he was born. He was known as MacDonnell Claragh (because, according to some, this was the name of his ancestor's homestead, but rather from the broad cast of his features, for which peculiarity ' claragh ' is the Irish expression), and he is, after Carolan, one of the most eminent names amongst the later Irish minstrels. He commenced a translation into Irish of Homer's ' Iliad,' but did not live to finish it ; he amassed materials for a ' History of Ireland,' and"], [59, "MACDONNELL \u2014 CUNNINGHAM. 45 began the work, but never completed it ; he was ' a man of great erudition, and a profound Irish antiquarian.' He was most popular throughout Munster, and to this day is not forgotten there. He was the last, or one of the last, who maintained the ancient practice of holding Bardic Conventions. He sung more than patriotic wails and Jacobite laments. He looked back at what his country was in old days, and saw what she was in his day, and his heart took fire, and he cried out for the sword, and called on his countrymen to ' unite in valorous fight for the land that gave them birth.' But their spirit is cold, and they have not in their veins the blood of their fathers, who 'were men.' And so MacDonnell Claragh, with the language and fervour of a poet, and the soul of a warrior, would fain have made a stroke for Freedom with the ' soldier lad,' young James, with his depressed and degraded fellow-bondsmen, with anyone, under any conditions \u2014 but all in vain ; and him self, hunted and oppressed, goes down to the grave with his works unfinished, his hopes unfulfilled CUNNINGHAM. John Cunningham is one of the many whom Fame has treated hardly, and rewarded niggardly. His epitaph records that 'his works will remain a monument for ages ' \u2014a prediction as yet unfulfilled, though his ballads, it is said, are even at present, after a lapse of more than a century, sung in the streets of Dublin, and his name is never heard as the author. A farce, written while he still was in his teens, gave Garrick matter for the ' Lying Valet ;' but the ' Lying Valet ' is remembered, and Cunningham and his ' Love in a Mist ' are forgotten. A"], [60, "46 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Cowley in precocity, a Shenstone in style, he enjoyed a fair reputation during his brief lifetime, and had a more successful career, in all its vicissitudes, than many of his contemporaries. Dr. Johnson praised him : ' Although Cunningham cannot be admitted to a very high rank among poets, he may be allowed to possess a considerable share of genius. His poems have peculiar sweetness and elegance ; his sentiments are generally natural ; his language simple, and appropriate to his subject' This was said of his volume of ' Pastoral Poems,' in the composition of which he was a disciple and imitator of Shenstone. His 'Day: a Pastoral,' is in every respect excellent, and is one of the best poems of that description in the English language. But notwithstanding contemporary praise and appreciation, his name is to-day strange \u2014 almost unknown. John Cunningham was the son of a Dublin wine merchant, and was born in that city in 1729. He wrote verses and ballads at twelve years of age which found refuge in 'Poets' Corners' in the newspapers, and eventu ally sunk to street-singers \u2014 presumably their fit desti nation. At seventeen he wrote ' Love in a Mist \u2022' a farce which was not unsuccessful in Dublin. At twenty he was a strolling player, and made a name in the English provinces. At thirty-four he retired from the stage, settled in Newcastle-on-Tyne, wrote his ' Pastorals ' and ' Poems;' and after a long and painful illness died in 1773. He rewarded the kindness of the Newcastle folk, with whom as a player he had been ever a favourite, by immortalising the beer manufactured in the town ; and, although the versification betrays his nationality \u2014 rhyming ' placed ' with ' feast,' and ' diseases ' with ' raises ' \u2014 his song, ' Newcastle Beer,' is, of its kind, a good drinking-"], [61, "CUNNINGHAM \u2014 KANE O'HARA. 47 song, full of jollity and humour, and without a touch of coarseness. The ' Holiday Gown ; or, I'd Wed if I were not too Young,' is a song of surpassing excellence ; and these two compositions alone entitle Cunningham to no mean place in Irish anthology. KANE O'HARA Kane O'Hara is, in the biographical notices, said to have been a younger son of a gentleman whose children moved in the fashionable circles of Dublin, in the middle of the last century. So little, however is known of his parentage and early life that the date of his birth is variously assigned to any year between 1715 and 1733. That he died on the 17th June, 1782, is an ascertained fact, and that during his lifetime he enjoyed a great and deserved popularity, and earned a fame which lasted long after his death, are matters of history. He made his reputation by his burlesques\u2014 to which he exclusively devoted himself \u2014 and his knowledge of music, the vivacity of his style, the humour of his songs, situations and dialogues, insured in almost every instance an immediate success and popularity to his writings. His ' Tom Thumb ' was produced at Covent Garden in 1780. It is based on Fielding's ' Tom Thumb,' of which work it is recorded of Dean Swift that he never laughed but twice in his life, once at a trick performed by a conjurer, and once at the scene where Tom Thumb kills the ghost To have caused the great grim Dean to laugh is a super lative tribute to Fielding's mirth-moving qualities, and yet it is generally allowed that O'Hara's version excels Fielding's, in humour as in every other respect His fust burlesque, the well-known ' Midas,' is unquestionably"], [62, "48 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. almost, if not altogether, his best. It was meant to throw ridicule on the Italian operas, and was produced in the old Dublin Theatre in Crow Street in January, 1764 ; was reproduced in Covent Garden in the following month in a condensed form, and was repeated nine times during the season \u2014 no small distinction in those days. In 1773 ' The Golden Pippin ' was brought out, also at Covent Garden Theatre, and the success that attended its pro duction was considerably enhanced by the acting and singing of Nan Catley. In 1775 the 'Two Misers' was performed; and in 1777, at the Haymarket Theatre, ' April Day ' was produced. Of Kane O'Hara's personal history some meagre particulars have been preserved. His conversation, as is the case with many witty and humorous writers, gave no indi cation of the wit and humour of his burlesques. Indeed, he is generally spoken of as dull and tiresome in the manner and style of his talk. He was a remarkably tall man \u2014 ' cruel tall ' in the words of a contemporary joke \u2014 ' with the appearance of an old fop with spectacles and an antiquated wig.' He lived and probably died in Molesworth Street, Dublin, and it was through his in fluence and exertions the Musical Academy of Ireland, of which he became vice-president, was founded in 1758. MAGRATH. The usual uncertainty and haziness envelops the life of Andrew Magrath, the last Irish poet who wTOte in his native language. Hardiman in his ' Minstrelsy,' in language of doubtful eulogy, says : ' As a poet he not only excelled the mob of English gentlemen who wrote with ease, but also many of those whom Dr. Johnson has designated"], [63, "MAGRATH. 49 English poets. His habits and writings closely resembled those of Prior. Like him, Magrath delighted in mean company. His life was irregular, negligent, and sensual. He has tried all styles from the grotesque to the solemn, and has not so failed in any as to incur derision or disgrace.' He was a prolific writer of songs 'of a jovial, amatory, and political nature ;' and in Munster, more especially in his own county of Limerick, he was known in his lifetime and is even still remembered, because of his wit and eccentricity, by an Irish nickname which means ' Mixture of Drollery,' or 'Merry-dealer.' He was a friend of con temporary poetasters. He was born in Limerick ' by the banks of the Maig ' sometime about 1720 \u2014 1725, and was alive in 1790 ; but he seems to have melted, mist-like, out of the world, for the time and circumstances of his death \u2014 beyond that it is traditionally said he died at the house of one O'Donnell, near Kilmallock, and to him bequeathed his voluminous and versatile manuscripts \u2014 are known no better than the time of his birth. He seems to have be come a kind of schoolmaster occasionally, and to have been a drunkard and licentiate always. He was migratory in his habits, ' a roving blade ' who lampooned and ridiculed those obnoxious to him with a free spirit, and had to rove further to escape the vengeance he invoked. He was a sot amongst sots, but always seems to have been esteemed as a personage even by the most degraded ; and notwithstanding his mode of life he lived to a ripe old age, 'an eccentric genius, but true poet.' He was buried in Kilmallock churchyard, near which it is said he breathed his last ; but we are informed there is no stone to mark his grave, and no inscription therefore to supply us with the dates of his birth and death. 4"], [64, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 50 DERMODY. Thomas Dermody is one of the most remarkable figures in Irish literature. With a brilliant and extraordinary genius, and all the mental qualities to make a great and wonderful writer, he led a life of such utter depravity, and died so young and so miserable, that the mind alter nates between feelings of loathing at the degraded tastes and bestial life, and of compassion on him for the splendid abilities and the many accomplishments wrecked and misapplied. Of him, Raymond, his biographer, wrote: ' His poetical powers may be said to have been intuitive, for some of his best pieces were composed before he had reached twelve years of age. His language was nervous, polished, and fluent. His wonderful classical knowledge, added to a memory uncommonly powerful and compre hensive, furnished him with allusions that were appropriate, combinations that were pleasing, and sentiments that were dignified. He had an inquisitive mind, but could never resist the temptations which offered to seduce him from his studies. No one ever wrote with greater facility; his mind was stored with such a fund of observation, such an accumulation of knowledge gathered from science and from nature, that his thoughts, when wanted, rushed upon him like a torrent, and he could compose with the rapidity with which another could transcribe. There is scarcely a style of composition in which he did not in some degree excel. The descriptive, the ludicrous, the didactic, the sublime, each, when occasion required, he treated with skill, with acute remark, imposing humour, profound reflection, and lofty magnificence.' And on the whole, this is not an exaggerated description of Dermody's"], [65, "DERMODY. 51 character as a poet, though it may seem so. ' With sense to know the right and choose the wrong,' he dragged on a life in which mean beggary and dissipation alternated with literary work marked by much beauty, learning, humour, pathos and genius \u2014 and at the early age of twenty-seven, disgraced, dishonoured, but yet immorta lised, he was buried in Lewisham graveyard. In the entire record of literary genius we find no such character as Dermody. Some one has called him the Chatterton of Ireland \u2014 a comparison surely not to Chat terton's advantage. It can scarcely be credited \u2014 would have scarcely been credited by Mr. Shandy, who made researches into the history of precociousness, and quoted some peculiar examples thereof \u2014 that this Dermody was as an infant an accomplished wine-bibber, a deliberate drunkard. It is said he inherited this taste from his father, a schoolmaster in Ennis ; but hereditary theories will not sufficiently explain the recorded fact that at the age of ten Dermody was a confirmed and seasoned whisky-drinker. He was born in 1775 at Ennis, the son of a school master there, who afterwards moved to Galway ; and we read that in 1785 he abandoned or pretended to aban don the bottle \u2014 a temporary awakening and repentance caused by the death of an elder brother. We are more surprised at this than to hear that at this age he had written much, for Cowley and Pope and others are stand ing examples of juvenile powers. Soon after the death of this elder brother, Dermody, animated by the ' History of Tom Jones ' to a life of adventure, secretly started for Dublin with two shillings in his pocket, and there com menced a career full of vicissitude, but more full of wretchedness and sickening depravity. No youth of his 4\u20142"], [66, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 52 class ever had such opportunities ; no one abused such opportunities as he did. Had he led a life of industry, rectitude, and sobriety, his name might to-day have been that of the National Poet of Ireland \u2014 a far greater than Moore. As it was, though rescued time after time out of the mire, he always turned again to it, till at length disgusted Patronage and exhausted Friendship cast him adrift to die in the gutter he loved. When he arrived in Dublin, yet a mere child, he spent his time hovering around bookstalls. The owner of such a stall, fearful of a theft, and watching the boy, discovered him one day, not thieving, but reading a Greek author ; whereupon he employed the furtive student to teach his son ' the classics.' The engagement was cut short by Dermody's drunkenness. The bookseller compassion ately procured him a new employment, which was soon lost through the same cause. He managed to make friends with several gentlemen studying at Trinity Col lege, who befriended him, to be imposed on by him. Mr. Owenson, the actor, Lady Morgan's father, took an interest in him and introduced him to a Dr. Young, who volunteered to advance his studies and support him. But studies were neglected, and Dermody, possessed of his old devil, dismissed to destitution once more. But Fortune befriended the prodigy. A clergyman \u2014 a Mr. Austen, rector of Maynooth \u2014 noticed him, took him to his house, raised a subscription amongst his friends for the maintenance and education of the young genius. But to no avail; Dermody, after repeated offences, was again expelled. Mr. Owenson for the second time obtained for him a patron \u2014 a Mr. Atkinson, on whose advice and recommen dation the Dowager Countess of Moira adopted the boy-"], [67, "DERMODY. 53 poet, sending him to the Rev. Mr. Boyd, of Killeigh, under whom, at her expense, he was to be perfected in his studies. Here for a time he was steady and made progress in learning. He added knowledge of French and Italian to his acquaintance with the dead languages ; he delighted Lady Moira, who was proud of her protege ; but the old habit again conquered him, and again he is out on the world, not entirely friendless, for Lady Moira is ready with her purse for his destitution. He wrote afterwards of her the lines commencing : ' Ah ! deeds of tenderness to earth unknown, Felt by her keener sense and heaven alone.' But her forbearance is soon exhausted, and, sunk to the lowest depths of debauchery and wretchedness, friendless and destitute, he tries to gain a living by writing political pamphlets. He would walk sixteen miles to solicit a subscriber's name, and, disappointed and penniless, pledge his very shoe-buckles for a drink. This was in 1793, when he was eighteen years of age. Pamphlets and politics did not pay, and he essayed a new and facile composition, begging letters. At this point of his career he was saved from death by starvation by Mr. Attorney- General Wolfe (afterwards the ill-fated Chief Justice Lord Kilwarden), who placed him in Trinity College, under taking to pay the expenses of his education and contri bute thirty pounds a year towards his maintenance. Another splendid opportunity thrown away ! The next we hear of Dermody is serving as a private soldier \u2014 somewhat reformed, for he is promoted to be a sergeant. He goes to England with his regiment, gains Lord Moira's favour, and by it obtains a lieutenancy of some kind While a soldier, and when in his nineteenth"], [68, "54 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. year, he wrote a poem called ' The Retrospect' He retired from the army on half-pay ; and the next scene is a relapse to the old vicious course, and Dermody starv ing in a cobbler's garret He is rescued this time by Mr. Raymond, afterwards his biographer, who induces him to collect his poems and to have them published. This is done ; the collection is dedicated to the Lady Moira whose patronage and protection he thrice for feited ; it is a success, and on its proceeds he lives respectable for a while \u2014 for a little while. Back he sinks to debauchery and misery. But he has made a name as a poet and satirist, and Laureate Pye procures for him money-grants from the Benevolent Royal Literary Fund. These minister not to his mind, but to his vices ; his constitution is broken down, and to retrieve wasted and lost health he is advised to seek change of air.' Another volume is issued, full of merit and power, but no patron age is present to secure purchasers. Friends are all alienated ; and neglected, in utter poverty and friendless ness, he finds refuge in a hovel in a purlieu of Sydenham. Raymond discovers him and again succours him ; but he is past succour, and after lingering for a day or two he dies, aged twenty-seven years and six months. His life was ot such persistent depravity that it is repulsive; his character was ufiredeemed by a single virtue ; yet when we turn to his poetry we must feel regret that such noble talents were unfosteied, were stained with vice and soaked in drink. The song ' The Sensitive Linnet,' written before he was ten years of age, is worthy of the Elizabethan age. His ' Contentment in Adversity ' is full of humour : ' In a cold empty garret contented I sit, With no spark to warm me but sparks of old wit."], [69, "DERMODY. 55 Here's a health then to Fate, and to Fortune her daughter (Misfortune I mean), though I'm sorry 'tis water ; Yet water itself, sirs, may toast such a madam, For 'twas wine, beer, and rum, in the fair days of Adam. So why may not I, then, imagine it claret ? For his taste was as fine as his son's in a garret.' What can be finer or purer than those lines in ' Patron age,' where he speaks of the consolations he discerns through the sable shroud of sorrow which wraps him ? Friendship solaces him : ' And fair Devotion, brightly fleeting by, Unbars new portals to a purer sky ; Whence seraphs, leaning from th' angelic quire, Invite to sweep a more immortal lyre.' We have alluded to the comparison which some one has instituted between Dermody and Chatterton. There is one similitude that will occur to everyone. Chatterton's ' Farewell to Bristol ' is suggested by Dermody 's ' Fare well to Ireland' Chatterton wrote : ' Farewell Bristolia's dingy piles of brick, Lovers of mammon, worshippers of trick ; You scorned the boy that gave you antique lays, And gave him in reward some empty praise.' And so on in this strain. Chatterton's contempt and wrath were perhaps due to a real cause. Dermody's 'Farewell to Ireland,' written in 1794, is masterly in invective, but is a monument of ingratitude and callous ness. We may quote it here, as it cannot find place in the subsequent pages ; it will show what a versatile genius the boy was dowered with, and justify our regrets at his misspent, wretched, brief life : ' Rank nurse of nonsense, on whose thankless coast The base weed thrives, the nobler bloom is lost ; Parent of pride and poverty, where dwell Dulness and brogue and calumny \u2014 farewell.

Oh, raise thy pale, thy drooping sons around ; Exalt the poor, the lordly proud oppress, Thy tyrants humble, but thy soldiers bless, Worn by long toil, as if foredoom'd by fate To glut some pampered reprobate of state ; Thy artists cherish, bid the mighty soul Of wisdom range beyond cold want's control ; And haply when some native gem you see Unknown, unfriended, lost \u2014 oh, think on me !' LYSAGHT. The man who wrote such songs as ' The Sprig of Shille lagh ' and ' Kitty of Coleraine,' and that one addressed to Henry Grattan, ' The Gallant Man who led the Van of Irish Volunteers,' to say nothing of countless others which charmed and delighted at the time, but which are now lost or dispersed or without their father's name, would be sure of being remembered, even had he no further title to fame. But ' Pleasant Ned Lysaght,' as he was known by his contemporaries, was a well-known barrister, an accom plished wit, a notable bon viva?it, an uncorrupted poli tician in days when corruption, naked and not ashamed, swayed the politics of Irishmen.* He was the son of John Lysaght, of the county Clare, and descended from an ancient Irish family, an offshoot of the royal house of O'Brien.

He was born on 21st December, 1763, and was educated in Cashel, at a Catholic school, though he was a Protestant, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1779, where he graduated B.A in 1782. He afterwards was at Oxford, where he graduated M.A. in 1784, and he was called to the English Bar at the Middle Temple, and to the Irish Bar, in the year 1798 \u2014 being then thirty-five years of age. His intention was to live and practise in England, but he had to leave that country owing to monetary difficulties. He therefore returned to Ireland, and attained to a very successful practice at the Bar, from which he retired on being appointed a Divisional Police Magistrate of Dublin, in 1809. He died in 1810, and the best evidence of his worth and popularity is in the fact that the members of his profession, the judges and barristers of Ireland, con tributed over ,-\u00a32,500 to a fund for his widow and children. Lysaght was a bright particular star in the midst of a literary constellation. The Munster Bar, with which he went circuit, was in his time ' the most brilliant, eloquent, and gifted body of barristers that any circuit has ever assembled together j and in a company composed of such men as Curran, O'Connell, Deane Grady, Keller, Quin, McCarthy, etc., Lysaght occupied a pre-eminent position. Mr. Owen Madden, in his 'Revelations of Ireland,' speaking from a personal acquaintance with him, says : ' A man of more varied talents it was impossible to meet In his personal character he was a thorough Irishman \u2014 brave, brilliant, witty, eloquent, and devil may-care.' His bravery was shown in his attitude in respect to the Volunteer movement, and his vigorous"], [72, "58 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. opposition to the proposed Act of Union. His brilliance and wit were the talk of his contemporaries. His eloquence was notable amongst an eloquent bar. His devil-may-careness is seen in the many anecdotes pre served of him. He is the reputed author of the ' Rakes of Mallow,' and, whether he wrote it or not, he was worthy to be the author : Spending faster than it comes, Beating waiters, bailiffs, duns, Bacchus' true-begotten sons, Live the Rakes of Mallow.' He was, Mr. Owen Madden tells us, ' a very decided rake.' People esteemed it a privilege to be in his com pany, and yet he lived in constant fear of arrest for debt. ' He used only to skulk out at night ; he lived in Trinity College in order to be out of the reach of bailiffs and duns.' ' He was short in stature, with a very long nose ;' and withal preferred his bottle and his pleasure, his jokes and his songs, to his briefs and law-books. ' Poetry and pistols, wine and women,' were, in his own words, all he lived for. He earned a happy name, ' Pleasant Ned Lysaght,' and left a happy memory amongst his friends and acquaintances ; but life was never a serious matter with him. He was acting as second, on one occasion, to Deane Grady, in a duel between the latter and Counsellor O'Maher. O'Maher's second, during the preliminaries, drew Lysaght's attention to the fact that his pistol was cocked. ' Take care, Mr. Lysaght, your pistol is cocked.' ' Well, then,' says Pleasant Ned, ' cock yours, and let me take a slap at you, as we are idle.' He married, and Sir Jonah Barrington records that he discovered his father-in-law, whom he believed to be a wealthy Jew, to be only a bankrupt Christian ; yet the"], [73, "LYSAGHT \u2014 SHERIDAN. 59 disappointment had little or no effect ; his exuberant spirits, his irrepressible gaiety and wit, were superior to greater misfortunes. In his private life he was irre proachable \u2014 ' a nobly-spent life,' says Madden ; and there is throughout his songs a healthy tone of feeling and lofty sentiment that, notwithstanding his debts and difficulties, and dodges and devil-may-careness, show that he was a pure-minded and good man. SHERIDAN. The concluding lines of Byron's rather heavy monody on the death of Sheridan, ' Nature made but one such man, And broke the die in moulding Sheridan,' convey a true idea of the estimation in which the great Irishman was held by his contemporaries, and in which he will ever be held \u2014 for another Sheridan is as impos sible as another Shakespeare. To our thinking he was far and away the greatest Irishman whose name is on the roll of Irish literature ; not the greatest song-writer, but greatest in the combination of brilliant qualities, varied accomplishments, extraordinary characteristics. A wonderful genius ; his life is itself a comedy, his death a pitiable tragedy. He wrote ' The Rivals ' ; he delivered the Begum oration ; he said more witty things than would have sufficed to give a reputation to a dozen men. The boon companion of princes of the blood ; the cynosure of London society, to which his presence was life and laughter; the applauded of the populace, the schools, and the senate, he yet was drunk in the gutters one day, in the spunging-house another, and again sleeping-off the"], [74, "60 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. previous night's debauch to rise at midday to booze and gamble with Fox. He died heart-broken and harassed, neglected and forsaken by those whom he was wont to delight. He enjoyed political offices, and was a privy councillor ; his life was a succession of intellectual triumphs, one of which would suffice for an immortality ; and side by side with these we find a life of dissipation, debts, difficulties, duns, through which his extraordinary wit, his powers for raillery and persuasion, carried him almost unharmed. A human anomaly; profligate and profuse, yet he never had a shilling of his own; lazy, careless, and indolent \u2014 he was offered by a pub lisher if he would write out for the press the Begum speech, accepted the terms, but never performed the easy task, though at the time a thousand pence would have been a sum of consequence to him \u2014 yet at times industrious, careful, and energetic. The dialogues in his plays were altered and polished and elaborated with scrupulous care, and his great orations were prepared for days beforehand. Nevertheless, in almost every incident of his life he seems to have acted on the principle that what could be done to-morrow should never be done to-day. The Begum speech was the crowning effort of his genius. Pitt, Burke, and Fox, themselves Parliamentary orators of the highest distinc tion, adjudged it to be the most splendid speech ever delivered to mankind. Pitt said ' that it surpassed all the eloquence of ancient or modern times, and possessed all that genius and art could furnish to agitate and con trol the human mind ;' Burke declared it to be ' the most astonishing effort of eloquence, argument, and wit united, of which there was any record or tradition ;' and Fox said, ' all that he had ever heard or read when com-"], [75, "61 SHERIDAN. pared with it dwindled into nothing, and vanished like vapour before the sun.' As to his wit, Fox pronounced him to be 'the wittiest man he had ever known.' His wit was great even in his cups. The Wilberforce anec dote is superb. He was found drunk in the channel, and when asked by the watchman where he lived and what was his name, he in a whispered hiccup replied : ' Wilberforce.' \u2014 Wilberforce drunk and incapable in the gutter ! ' Sherry all over,' says Byron. ' The Rivals ' was written in two months, and though the first representation was a failure, the play, when pruned and improved, was a conspicuous success. ' The School for Scandal ' was an immediate and pronounced success, and is even a greater favourite now than it was in his own day. ' The Critic ' is the best of his plays and the best play of its kind \u2014 a success in a line where others had failed Of his comedies, however, Macaulay \u2014 who declared the Begum speech to be 'the finest which had been delivered within the memory of man ' \u2014 recorded his opinion that Sheridan was not the equal of Wycherley, and that ' no writers have injured the comedy of England so much as Congreve and Sheridan,' and supports it by arguments to be found in his ' Essay on Machiavelli.' But though the wit and humour of 'The Rivals' is artificial and laboured, and the plot meagre, and the characters, excepting Sir Anthony Absolute, dis appointing and unnatural, yet it is to be borne in mind that it holds the stage at present, and shows no decline in public favour. Dr. Johnson, between whom and Sheridan's father there was ill-feeling sufficient to cause a rupture in an old friendship, said that ' the man who has written the two best comedies of his age is surely a considerable"], [76, "62 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. man ' \u2014 no weak praise from Johnson. Byron's commen dation is superlative likewise : ' He has written the best comedy, the best drama, the best farce, and the best address ; and, to crown all, delivered the very best ora tion ever conceived or heard in this country.' He softened the hearts of hostile attorneys and averted ruinous suits. He was a huge and notorious fraud in money matters, yet he was idolised and his unprincipled conduct condoned. He could joke with and at the Prince Regent and the Duke of York, and charm Madame de Stael. Contrast all this with his tears when declaring 'he never knew what it was to have a shilling of his own,' and his ' passionate weeping ' at the profanation his person suffered in the spunging-house in Tooke's Court, near Chancery Lane, and with that wretched, saddest, and most pathetic last letter of his to Rogers, written when the bailiffs were in possession a few days before his death: 'I am absolutely undone and broken-hearted. They are going to put the carpets out of the windows and break into the room and take me.' The laughter and admiration that are evoked by his life-story are turned into the utmost pity by the record of his death.

Dies at the house of Mr. Peter Moore, in Great George's Street, Westminster (his own residence, 17, Saville Place, being in the hands of bailiffs), and buried in the Abbey. This is a succinct relation of the incidents of Sheri dan's life, to which we need add little beyond drawing attention to the early development of his genius. He was but twenty-three when ' The Rivals ' was written, and twenty-six when ' The School for Scandal ' was produced. He absolutely died in penury and misery. Writs and executions thick as autumn leaves in Vallombrosa showered upon him, and with bailiffs in the house and a sheriff's officer arresting him on his death-bed, and threatening to carry him to the spunging-house, blankets and all, he learned that a public appeal on his behalf had been made in the Morning Post, and heard the too late inquiries of dukes and earls at his door. He was borne to his grave by the highest nobility, he who a week before was at the mercy of a brutal sheriffs officer. Thomas Moore wrote the following noble and just lines on the sad and disgraceful circumstances attending poor Sheridan's death and burial : ' Oh ! it sickens the heart to see bosoms so hollow, And friendship so false in the great and high born ; To think what a long line of titles may follow The relics of him who died friend^oss and lorn. How proud they can press to the funeral array Of him who they shunned in his sickness and sorrow ; How bailiffs may seize his last blanket to-day, Whose pall shall beheld up by nobles to-morrow.' 5"], [80, "66 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Sheridan was a remarkable instance of hereditary genius. His father, Thomas Sheridan (who was born at Quilca, in Cavan, in 1721, the descendant of the sept of O'Sheridan of Cavan), was the author of the well-known ' Dictionary,' and of the ' Life of Swift,' whose collected works he edited. He was an M.A. of Trinity College, Dublin ; took to the stage, making his first appearance at the theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin ; taught elocution ; became manager of Drury Lane ; obtained a pension of ,\u00a3200 a year from Lord Bute. He married Frances, the authoress of ' Sidney Biddulph' \u2014 a novel much admired by Dr. Johnson \u2014 and other less known works. Thomas Sheridan was the son of Dr. Thomas Sheridan, who for feited his appointment of Vice-regal Chaplain by preach ing on the day of the anniversary of the succession of the House of Hanover from the text ' Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.' He once had a great school in Dublin ; was the intimate friend of Dean Swift ; was slovenly, indigent, cheerful, good-natured, improvident ; a punster, and a fiddler \u2014 a parson and schoolmaster by turns \u2014 a joker and fiddler always. He died in great poverty in Dublin, in 1738. The descendants of Richard Brinsley Sheridan \u2014 two of whom, Lady Dufferin and Hon. Mrs. Norton, we refer to subsequently \u2014 are living proofs of hereditary genius. Sheridan's songs are full of beauty and tenderness, of gaiety and clan. Some of them are unsurpassed in lyric literature. The celebrated song \u2014 in ' The School for Scandal ' \u2014 ' Here's to the Maiden of Bashful Fifteen,' is evidently suggested by and framed on the song ' A Health to the Nut-brown Lass,' in Suckling's play of 'The Goblins.' But all he touched he adorned in a manner solely his own. ' He ran through each mode of"], [81, "SHERIDAN. 67 the lyre, and was master of all.' A just and delicate estimate of his genius will be found in Hazlitt ; his songs speak for themselves. There is one episode in Sheridan's life which his biographers overlook \u2014 his nomination as joint candidate with Mr. Colclough, of Tintern Abbey, for the represen tation of the county Wexford, at the general election of 1808. The facts of that contest, the mortal duel be tween Colclough and Alcock the rival candidate, are to be found in Barrington's 'Sketches.' Needless to say that Colclough being killed, Sheridan was not elected One final word : whatever the opinions may be of Sheridan's character, founded on his imprudence, ex travagance, embarrassments, and unprincipledness, there can be but one opinion of his magnificent genius, and of the works that he has left as the perpetual delight of every generation. Yet Ireland has never done anything for his memory \u2014 no statue in a street, not even a tablet in a church. During his lifetime Ireland did something for him. ' My old friend,' said Dr. Johnson, speaking of him, ' had been honoured with extraordinary attention in his own country by having had an exception made in his favour in an Irish Act of Parliament concerning Insolvent Debtors. Thus to be singled out by the Legislature as an object of public consideration and kindness is a proof of no common merit.' We will not dispute the attention, the consideration and kindness thus once shown him by his countrymen : we will merely observe that public money is yearly spent in Ireland on objects and projects far less creditable and honourable than that of erecting a public memorial to the greatest and most versatile Irishman of his day \u2014 the man of e \u2014 1"], [82, "68 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. most varied, brilliant, and manifold gifts which Ireland has yet produced. MILLIKEN. Richard Alfred Milliken, attorney-at-law, painter and musician \u2014 from all of which pursuits he derived neither profit nor fame \u2014 wrote ' The Groves of Blarney,' and brought to himself renown. The genesis of this celebrated and popular song is worth recording. At a gathering at a country seat, Castlehyde, in county Cork, an ambitious production of a local ' poet ' \u2014 one of those strolling versifiers and ballad-singers who were peculiar to Ireland a century or so ago \u2014 was read and talked over after dinner. It was absurd in its expressions, confused in its ideas, and floundering in its facts ; and Milliken under took to write a song equal to it or excelling it in absurdity ; and he wrote the famous ' Groves of Blarney.' He was a genial, jovial soul. Lysaght was ' Pleasant Ned Lysaght' with his companions: Milliken was ' Honest Dick Milliken.' He was born in 1767 at Castle Martyr, in Cork ; was an attorney, and tried to practise, but the business was not congenial, and so he spent his life in rhyming and painting and playing music, and de lighting the social circles of Cork. He tried blank verse with indifferent success, and edited a monthly journal \u2014 \u25a0 The Casket \u2014 which disappeared in the troubles of 179S. He died the 16th of December, 1815, was buried at Douglas, near Cork, and was justly lamented as one of the many brilliant men that Cork has contributed to the wit and literature of the kingdom."], [83, "69 CURRAN. CURRAN. Curran is remembered as the greatest forensic orator of a day when eloquent advocates were more plentiful than at present ; and as a great wit, amongst great wits, rather Chan as a song-writer. He was Master of the Rolls in Ireland, but was no lawyer ; he was a conspicuous member of the Irish Parliament, but no statesman. He was the most brilliant ornament in Irish society, the most popular man at the Irish Bar ; a fearless advocate, a true patriot ; and his last years were overclouded with domestic sorrow ; his great genius drooped into a melan choly, and, hopeless and depressed, he saw his beloved Ireland ' like a bastinadoed elephant kneeling to receive the paltry rider.' Before he was forty years of age he was offered a judgeship and a peerage if he would take the Government side in the Regency Debate in the Irish Parliament, but resolutely refused to sell himself, his principles, and his honour. Throughout his life he was honest and uncorruptible amongst the corrupt and dis honest, and his last speech in Parliament, in 1797, was devoted to an endeavour to effect some reform in the Administration, and to stay the flood of venality, intrigue, and jobbery that so soon debauched the Irish Legis lature. His speeches at the Bar are familiar to most readers ; his jokes and witticisms are daily recounted, as fresh at present as when they were uttered. We have already quoted Byron's opinion of Sheridan; his opinion of Curran is likewise superlative in its laudation : ' Curran's the man who struck me most. Such imagination ! There never was anything like it that ever I saw or heard of. His published life, his published speeches, give you no idea of the man \u2014 none at all He was wonderful"], [84, "IRISH SONGS AND SONC-WRITERS. 70 even to me, who had seen many remarkable men of the time. The riches of his Irish imagination were exhaust less. I heard him speak more poetry than I have ever seen written. I saw him presented to Madame de Stael, and they were both so ugly that I could not help wondering how the best intellects of France and Ireland could have taken up respectively such residences.' ' His imagination was infinite, his fancy boundless, his wit in defatigable,' says one who had a long and close intimacy with him, ' and his person was mean and decrepit, very slight, very shapeless \u2014 spindle limbs, a shambling gait, one hand imperfect, and a face yellow and furrowed, rather\" flat, and thoroughly ordinary ; yet,' continues the writer, Sir Jonah Barrington, ' I never was so happy in the company of any man as in Curran 's for many years.' Personal defects amounting to deformity were no de preciation to the meteoric eloquence and marvellous wit. The flat yellow face was redeemed by his wondrous dark lustrous eyes. But it is not as a master of eloquence or wit \u2014 as barrister or politician \u2014 that he here finds a place, but as a song-writer. He was not much of a poet, though his eloquence was all poetic, and though he wrote a most tender song, ' Let us be merry before we go ' \u2014 ' The Deserter's Meditation,' as he styled it \u2014 one that gave Byron the cue for one of his best songs. He once asked Godwin what he thought of a certain jury-speech, not a brilliant one, he had made at the Carlow Assizes, and Godwin said, ' I never did hear anything so bad as your prose, Curran, except your poetry ;' a harsh mis judgment of both. He was not a splendid success in every species of literary and intellectual labour he en gaged in: his songs are not extraordinarily good, but they"], [85, "CURRAN. 71 are good ; and the same can be said of his music, for he was also a musician. We shall be as succinct as possible in our biography of this great man. The Currans, we are told, were, in the old semi-legendary history of Ireland, ' eminent as poets and men of learning. They filled the positions of bards and historians in Leitrim, and poets in Breffni.' His father was ' seneschal of the Manor Court ' (a species of town-bailiff) of Newmarket, a small village now, of 1,000 inhabitants, in the county Cork ; and here John Philpot Curran was born on the 24th July, 1750. He was educated out of charity by the rector of the town (who discerned in the lad a mental capacity and power beyond the ordinary youth), and was subsequently sent to a school under a foundation of Lady Elizabeth Villiers (T709), in Midleton, a town not far distant He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1769, with the intention of entering the Church. His college career was rather dis tinguished \u2014 he obtained his scholarship in 1770 \u2014 and in 1773, the intention to join the Church having been re linquished, he was admitted at the Middle Temple ; and, while a student there, married his cousin, a Miss Creagh. ' Stuttering Jack Curran '\u2014 * Orator Mum' \u2014 these were the nicknames bestowed upon him, and prove that he had many natural difficulties to overcome before he could earn fame. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1775, and though in his earlier years at the profession his abilities were unacknowledged and unrecompensed, chiefly be cause he had had no opportunity of displaying them, yet, having once been heard, he rapidly earned the reputation that grew with each succeeding year of practice. His progress is exhibited by his changes of residence : Redmond's Hill, Fade Street, St. Andrew Street, Ely"], [86, "72 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Place (now No. 4), and 80, Stephen's Green, were his successive dwellings. He rapidly also became popular in society, and a favourite amongst the members of his own profession. He was one of the 'Order of St. Patrick,' or ' The Monks of the Screw,' whose charter song he wrote. This was a convivial and intellectual club which met weekly, on Saturdays, at a house in Kevin Street, Dublin, when Curran lived in Redmond's Hill ; and subsequently at his country house at Rath farnham, when he was ' Prior ' of the ' Monks.' The club, or ' society,' was composed of the brilliant men at the Bar and in Parliament, and came to an end in 1795. Curran was returned to the Irish Parliament as member for Kilbeggan in 1783, Flood being his colleague in the representation of that village borough ; and he joined the opposition, his politics being the liberalism of Grattan. He was also (1786 \u2014 1797) M.P. for Rath cormac, another village borough. He retired from Parliament in May, 1797. His greatest fame was earned by his defence of those charged with complicity in the rebellion of 1798. Of his speech on behalf of Hamilton Rowan, Lord Brougham said it was ' the greatest speech of an advocate in an cient or modern times.' His undaunted advocacy of the rebels led, on one occasion, to Lord Carleton, the Chief Justice, threatening to deprive him of his silk gown. He was appointed Master of the Rolls in Ire land, and made a Privy Councillor by Pitt, in 1806, and from that time he seems to have declined mentally and physically. He contested Newry for a seat in the Im perial Parliament in 1812, and was defeated by two votes ; and in the following year he resigned the Master ship of the Rolls, and went into retirement on a pension."], [87, "CURRAN. 73 Most of his time while he held the judicial office, and after his retirement, was spent in travelling, in the en deavour to regain his old vigour of mind and body, and to shake off the melancholy and depression that were overwhelming him.

In St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, there is, surmounted by a life-like bust by C.

A rough Irish-speaking poor country lad who rose to be the welcome guest of princes ; a wit whose presence charged the atmosphere with gaiety, and in whose train followed laughter loud and hearty, wearing out a weary life in peevish, dismal melancholy.

Contrast this episode with that where we see an enthusiastic populace cheering him to the echo, carrying him in triumph to his home, because he was the dauntless champion of freedom, the eloquent advocate of the op pressed. His great intellect overcame great obstacles. He was at the outset without influential friends, and a poor man \u2014 the only furniture of his rooms was his offspring ; \u2014 he was endowed with a contemptible personal appear ance, a stuttering tongue, an enfeebling nervousness, yet he was the greatest and most successful and most popular orator at the Irish Bar, in the early days of the century when the Irish Bar was renowned for its eloquence. A feeling of sadness at the decline of a great spirit, somewhat similar to that evoked by a consideration of the final scene of Sheridan's life, is present also in regard to the final days of Curran. How brilliant and celebrated he was in the Senate and at the Bar, for his wit and elo quence, is well known. Courted and flattered he was, like Sheridan, in his heyday while he could amuse ; and yet he died in obscurity, broken down by domestic sorrows, wretched from the depression of settled melancholy \u2014 ' he burst into tears and hung down his head ' upon an allu sion to Irish politics a few days before his death; \u2014 the eloquence was turned to prosiness, the wit to grossness, the ready repartee and flashing sarcasm to the drowsy inanities of hopeless imbecility \u2014 forgotten \u2014 neglected ! Yet his talents and pure patriotism were alike splendid, and alike creditable to Ireland, and he is fully deserving of Byron's eulogistic sentence \u2014 ' the best intellect of Ireland ' of his time."], [89, "CALLANAN. 75 CALLANAN. Like most of the Irish song-writers, Jeremiah (or James) Joseph Callanan was sprung from the people, and like many of them, he died while still a very young man. Callanan was a poet, and his brief life was yet long enough to earn a fame for his name. He was born in Cork in 1795, and of his early years nothing is known. Of obscure birth, he grew in obscurity, and at the age of nineteen entered the Maynooth Seminary, with the inten- tion of becoming a priest. After a residence here for about two years, he discovered the Church was not his vocation, and in 18 16 he went to Dublin, where he managed, through the charitable kindness of a friend, id enter Trinity College. While pursuing his course here, he gained the Vice-Chancellor's prizes for poems on 'Alexander the Great,' and ' The Accession of George IV.' His intentions during his collegiate career as re- gards a profession oscillated between the Bar and medicine, but he seems now, as throughout his life, to have been the victim of a restlessness and indecision which found an easy prey in his sensitive and nervous organisation. He left Trinity College after a two years' connection, and made his way to Cork. But he found neither parents nor relations nor friends here, and in a fit of dejection he enlisted in the 18th Royal Irish, as the only means open to him to gain a living. He was bought out of the service by some friends in time to prevent his sailing for Malta with his regiment He next lived in Millstreet, a little town in Cork county, as tutor in the family of a Mr. McCarthy. This employment was soon relinquished, for in 1822 he is back in Cork writing verses, and doing nothing more than write verses, for his"], [90, "76 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. livelihood. In the following year he obtained a master ship in the school of the celebrated Dr. Maginn, in Marl borough Street in that city. The young doctor discerned and fostered Callanan's talents, and obtained space in the pages of Blackwood's Magazine for some of his trans lations from the Irish. But the demon of unrest and indecision was ever with him, and he became dissatisfied with Dr. Maginn and with the drudgery of his ushership, and gave up his post after a few months, and took to wandering through the south of Ireland with the ostensible object of collecting materials in the shape of old Irish legends and songs for future literary labours. In this object he was somewhat successful, and his translations are full of beauty, music, and power. He took up his abode on the Island or Islet of Inchidoney, at the mouth of Clonakilty Bay, and here he lived a simple and frugal life, and mused his fill. Here he wrote ' The Recluse of Inchidoney, a Spenserian poem full of a tender simplicity which characterises all his descriptions of nature. Here he wrote his best-known poem, ' Gougane Barra ' \u2014 ' the best of all minor Irish poems,' according to one critic. He continued writing and roving in this fashion till 1S29, when his health (he was of a naturally delicate constitution) became affected, and the medical advice to try a southern climate disposed him to again become a tutor \u2014 this time in an Irish family in Lisbon. The mild and sunny clime of Portugal benefited him for a brief while, but the remedy had been too long deferred. After a residence there of only a few months, he set his foot on a ship to reach Ireland to die in his native land ; but he was too prostrate to undergo the sea-journey. He disembarked, and died on the foreign shore, on the 19th September, 1S29, aged thirty-four."], [91, "CALLANAN \u2014 KENNEY. 77 His place amongst the Irish poets is high and sure. He is the Irish poet of nature, ever in close and sweet communion with the sea and sky, the verdure, the streams and hills \u2014 all the works of God's hands ! He is full of grace and feeling, of unaffected piety, of unobtrusive virtue, of love of country \u2014 and over all there is a shadow of melancholy, of something unsatisfied, which gives a sorrowful, but not altogether joyless, tinge to his writing. There is no pettiness or frivolity in him. He is a purified and healthy Childe Harold. He has the tenderness without the gaiety, the sigh without the smile, the tear without the fun, of Irish poetry. Romantic and delicate, his poems are with him a means of regaining his old simplicity of mind and life, when ' With soul unsullied, and with heart unseared, Before he mingled with the herd of men,' he was 'sweetly lured on to virtue's shrine,' by a contem plation of the glories of that God of Nature to whose service he surrendered the last and best years of his brief life. KENNEY. The creator of ' Jeremy Diddler,' even if he had never written anything but 'Raising the Wind,' would have been sure of being remembered James Kenney, besides giving the world the great ' Jeremy Diddler,' with half a dozen plays, wrote long didactic poems and sparkling songs. According to a critique written immediately on his death, ' he was, as a farce-writer, one of the happiest and most popular artists of his time. He was a cultivated gentleman, moving in the best literary society, and will be gratefully remembered for his kindness to aspirants in"], [92, "78 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. dramatic authorship.' Notwithstanding that his writings enjoyed such a favour and popularity in his lifetime, and that he obtained large remunerations from time to time for them, he drifted into penury in his old age, and the voluntary benefit at Drury Lane, which was organised on his behalf, was of no avail to the veteran, for he died, it is said, on the morning of the performance, the rst August, 1849. Of Kenney's youth, little or nothing is known. He was born in the county Limerick, in 1780, of respectable parents, and removed at an early age to London, where the chief part of his after-life was spent. Though the University Magazine, in an obituary notice, said all his pieces were ' eminently attractive,' Byron's opinion was anything but favourable : ' While Kenney's World \u2014 ah ! where is Kenney's wit ? \u2014 Tires the sad gallery, lulls the restless pit.' Kenney suffered from a painful nervous affection, which gave such an eccentricity to his movements and appear ance that he was sometimes taken for an escaped lunatic MOORE. Thomas Moore, ' the poet of all circles, and the idol of his own,' is signally and unapproachedly the song-writer of Irish song-writers. A modern critic, himself a poet and an Irishman, has spoken of Moore as the ' tomtit amongst poets.' This is not the place to enquire at length into the justice or injustice of this judgment; nor is this the place to write a critical and exegetical essay on his merits and demerits as a poet. Briefly and perfunc torily we shall refer to his productions, prose and poetic; but whatever may now be the opinions of critics, however"], [93, "MOORE. 79 he may stand in the estimation of this age, when fashion so frequently decides merit and confers applause, there can be no question of this, that, as a song-writer, Moore will never decline from the supreme position he occupies amongst Irish authors. In his national songs, sung all the world over, to-day as half a century ago, to the ' Irish Melodies,' his fame may safely rest confident of immor tality. Thomas Moore, like the majority of the Irish song writers, was sprung from a humble origin. His father, John Moore, was a small tradesman, a grocer or such \u2014 it is said the business was established with the fortune he obtained with his wife, Miss Anastasia Codd \u2014 and the illustrious poet was born on the 28th May, 1779, at his shop in Aungier Street, Dublin. The house is at the corner of Little Longford Street, is now occupied by a publican, and has a little bust set in a niche in the wall, and a tablet with an inscrutable inscription, to mark the birth place of the national poet of Ireland. True, there is another memorial in his native city. In the most public thoroughfare there is a statue, which is the jest of the burlesques, the ridicule of tourists, the shame of the citizens. Moore would be more honoured by the removal and annihilation of that wretched memorial. As a boy, he was educated at the schools of Mr. Malone and the celebrated Samuel Whyte, in Grafton Street, Dublin, where Richard Brinsley Sheridan had been his predecessor ; and at sixteen years of age entered Trinity College, that had been opened in the previous year, 1794, to members of the faith to which Moore belonged. But even before his matriculation, while he was but fourteen years old, he had contributed verses to a Dublin journal called Anthologia Hibernica. The afflatus was upon him"], [94, "80 IRISH SONGS AND SONG WRITERS. early, and while in college he translated the Odes of Anacreon, in order to win a college prize, which, how ever, he did not win. He was an assiduous student, languages being his forte, and he cultivated with much success his natural talent for music. He was a member of the College Historical Society, where Emmet and Arthur O'Connor were prominent orators, and his friend ship for these almost involved him in the revolutionary proceedings of 1798. He left Trinity College and Ireland for London when he was twenty, and was entered on 28th May, 1798, at the Middle Temple, as Sheridan was before him, with the intention of being called to the Bar. Under the patronage of Lord Moira, who converted his father from a spirit dealer into a barrack-master and customs officer, he in 1800 published by subscription his ' Odes of Anacreon,' dedicated by permission, and through Lord Moira's kindly influence, to the Prince Regent. Elated with their success, he abandoned the law, resolved to live on his poetry. This first publication under such auspices was the means of introducing him to the fashionable society of London, and he charmed it with his personal accomplishments, and became what is called its darling. In 1802 he published the 'Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little,' \u2014 a play on his name and on his insignifi cant stature. It was because of this volume that Byron in his ' English Bards,' etc., 'grieved to condemn,' called Moore ' the melodious advocate of lust'\u2014 a rather strong description of a production which, though immoral and licentious, could hardly corrupt. Like many such pro ductions, it was openly condemned and widely read. The next incident in his life was an unfortunate one. His steadfast patron Lord Moira, at Lady Donegall's"], [95, "MOORE. 81 request, obtained for him in 1S03 the appointment to a Government post in Bermuda, whither he went, arriving there in January, 1804, and whence he returned very soon, finding the post uncongenial and the climate un healthy, and having committed his duties to a deputy. This subordinate embezzled large sums of the Govern ment moneys, for which Moore was responsible. The defalcations, amounting to about .\u00a36,000, were brought to light in 18 1 8, and Lord Lansdowne, his friend, paid the amount, and Moore repaid it from the proceeds of his literary labours. Soon after his return to England, in 1806, he published his 'Odes and Epistles.' These were so severely criticised in the Edinburgh Review \u2014 he was called a ' licentious versifier ' and ' poetical propagator of immorality ' \u2014 that he challenged Jeffrey. The celebrated Chalk Farm duel was arranged, the police interfered, the ' bloodless pistol ' was discovered, and \u2014 a comedy in real life \u2014 the combatants embraced and became friends. The incident was ridiculed by Byron, whom, therefore, Moore challenged with bloodthirsty pugnacity, hardly in keeping with his character; the result of the second challenge, though by different means, was also lifelong friendship between the two. In 1807 the 'Irish Melodies' were projected. In 181 1 he married Bessie Dykes, a young Irish actress, by whom he had three children, all of whom died in his lifetime. In 181 3 he wrote the 'Twopenny Post Bag,' which ran through fourteen editions in one year. The ambition to emulate his con temporary poets, to produce a poem, and not to rely for fame on short fugitive pieces, love-lyrics and political squibs, now possessed him, and in 181 7 ' Lalla Rookh' appeared Longman paid 3,000 guineas for it; the whole country joined in a chorus, a very tumult of applause. 6"], [96, "82 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Moore was the most popular man of the time. The world of fashion had cast off their former idol, Byron, and with exaggerated praise and superlative demonstration taken Moore to their hearts. In 1818 'The Fudge Family ' appeared. In this year also he visited Ireland, and was hailed with great enthusiasm as the National Baxd. He subsequently wrote ' The Loves of the Angels,' ' The Epicurean,' biographies of Byron, Sheri dan, and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, a ' History of Ire land,' and other works. In 18 19 he made a continental tour with Lord John Russell, who afterwards wrote his 'Life and Memoirs,' and who conferred (in 1835) a pension of \u00a3300 a year upon him. In 1832 he was solicited to stand for the Parliamentary representation of Limerick, as an O'Connellite, but declined. He died on the 25th January, r852, having for three years previously been, like his contemporaries Scott and Southey, almost an imbecile by reason of softening of the brain ; and the brilliant triumphs of a life of glory are darkened by this closing scene of sad infirmity. He was buried in Brom ham Churchyard, near Sloperton Cottage, where he lived ; there also on 4th September, 1865, his wife was laid beside him, and to their memory a beautiful window is in the church. Moore's versatility and his superiority in some, and his proficiency in the majority, of his literary undertakings have gained for him a high place not only in Irish, but in English literature. He was a translator, a musician, a song-writer, a poet, a satirist, a biographer, an historian, a prose story-teller. His prose story is languid and vague ; his ' History of Ireland ' is not now read. Of his biographies, that of Byron will always be of interest, not because of the biographer's art, but because of the"], [97, "83 MOORE. subject and the extracts from his letters and journals. Of another of his biographies the Prince Regent said that he had been guilty of a criminal offence in attempting the life of Sheridan. As regards his love-poems, their merits and demerits are alike great and striking. Perfect rhythm, unexcelled harmony, happiness of phrase, fidelity of description, felicity of epigram, are adorned with a luxuriance that overpowers, a languor and perfumery that is meritricious and artificial, an intensity that is strained. a feeling that is unreal, a gorgeousness that is tiresome and monotonous. Tenderness and sprightly fancy, picturesqueness and vivacity, exquisite finish and delicious gracefulness, lcse much of their beauty and power to charm because of the ever-present conviction that all is artificial and unreal \u2014 tinselled and spangled and bright only with a lime-light glare which soon dazzles and wearies. In his ' Translations,' the simplicity of the original is concealed or distorted by the clothings and embellishments of the copyist It is as a satirist and song-writer Moore will be best remembered ' The Fudge Family in Paris,' as a social and political sketch, is unsurpassed for humour, irony, and brilliancy. But as an Irish national song-writer, Moore's immortality is, as we have said, certain and secure. Though he is far and away inferior in robust feeling, healthy intensity, and vigorous and profound sensibility to Burns, he approaches nearly to Beranger. Though in the 'Melodies' the loftiness and dignity is sometimes sacrificed to a conceit or a stroke of wit, on the whole they are irreproachable and of the highest ex cellence. The melody is exquisite and faultless, the language clear and vigorous, tender and even majestic, the pathos is natural and true, the patriotism is purified 6\u20142"], [98, "84 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 'They are worth all the epics that ever were written) says Byron. To these songs his country is partially in debted for the early granting of Catholic Emancipation. The whole English-speaking world will for ever lie under an obligation to this son of the Aungier Street grocer for the sweetest and most singable lyrics in our literature. They were prompted by an enlightened and liberal patriot ism, and of them and of him Shelley well said that he was the sweetest lyric of Ierne's saddest song, and ' Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.' He was, as a husband and a son, irreproachable and estimable. He allowed his parents \u00a3100 a year when he was poor himself, and \" never omitted to write twice a week to his mother.\" His wife idolised him, as he idolised her, but even her loving solace could not relieve the bitterness occasioned by the loss of all his children in his lifetime. With many whose biographies are here briefly recorded \u2014 Sheridan, Curran, and others \u2014 the closing scenes of their lives are a strong and sad contrast to the brilliancy and triumphs of their literary and social careers. Moore is no exception. Though he did not, like Swift, expire ' a driveller and a show,' his life-light perished in pitiable imbecility. Nothing can be sadder than that picture of him weeping over one of his own melodies, which hear ing, he did not recognise. It was an altogether mournful and dismal termination to the darling of society, who in his heyday fascinated and enraptured that world of fashion which he so 'dearly loved.' GRIFFIN.

The man who at twenty-two years of age wrote 'Gisippus,' and at twenty three wrote 'The Collegians,' 'the most perfect Irish novel,' was no common person. What he might have been under other circumstances and other conditions is one of those problems which inevitably suggests itself in the perusal of his life. He did great things in a short, laborious, distracted life. He should have done the greatest had he lived on to the threescore years and ten, and had he passed his days in calmness, affluence, and contentment. As it was, his life was marked into successive stages of hope and disappoint ment, penury and feverish drudgery, success with its attendant praises, and desponding morbid religious ness. He was born at Limerick on 10th December, 1803, the ninth son of a county Limerick farmer, who after wards tried brewing as a trade ; was intended for the medical profession, but preferred to spend his time in dreaming and poetising. At an early age he wrote a drama, afterwards in later years, perhaps wisely, destroyed by him, and his ' first appearance in public ' was in the columns of a local newspaper. His ambition was cabined and cribbed in ' sweet Adare,' where he lived with his uncle after the removal of his parents to Pennsylvania ; and before he was twenty years old he betook himself to London with his boyish tragedy in his pocket and his heart full of high hopes. His tragedy was not accepted, and he found it a struggle to eke out his daily bread as a newspaper hack He toiled on in distress the greatest ; ' without food for three days ' was not a solitary episode in his life. He wrote poems for the magazines and articles for The Fashion News, and completed ' Gi-"], [100, "86 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. sippus,' another tragedy, which was 'written on little slips of paper in coffee-houses.' In 1827, worn out with the tedious and anxious bread struggle in London, where John Banim was his only friend, he returned to his kin in Ireland, and within a few months produced his ' Hallowtide Tales ' and ' Tales of the Munster Festivals.' The novel of 'The Collegians' was published in 1828 on his return to London, and fame and fortune now smiled hopefully upon him. Never theless he relinquished literature for a while, and at the London University entered upon the study of the law. This was soon abandoned in its turn for story-writing again, and then a despondency, which had been inter mittent for some years, settled upon him. A religious gloom overshadowed him ; melancholy anticipations of an early death \u2014 a ' strange feeling ' that he had in the days of his childhood \u2014 oppressed him ; he imagined he discovered that the well-merited fame that had crowned him was a delusion, a mockery, a vanity. The publishers had 'cheated him abominably.' Two guineas was his payment for translating a volume and a half of Prevost's works. He in his melancholy regarded his works as almost pernicious productions, and he destroyed his MSS. And then, ' tired,' as he wrote, ' of a stupid, lonely, wasting, desponding, caterpillar-kind of existence,' he retired from the world, its labours and rewards, its cares and glories, and became one of the Society of Christian Brothers, a body whose aim is to devote their unselfish lives to the education of the poor. In 1838 he joined their monastery in Dublin, to enter upon a severe and laborious ordeal ; from which, how ever, he derived happiness, we read. In 1839 he was transferred to the Cork establishment. The rigid vigils,"], [101, "87 GRIFFIN\u2014 MANGAN. the constant fasts, the consuming soul-anxiety wore him away. He contracted a fever, and died at the North Monastery on 12th June, 1S40. His resting-place in the cemetery of that institution is marked by a plain slab with the inscription, ' Brother Gerald Griffin.' The best of his many beautiful songs is perhaps ' Gille Machree ;' and the following verse from one of his poems, written in his earlier years on the occasion of his sister's death, will afford a fitting insight into the mysterious working of his mind and a proof of his high poetic power : ' If in that land where Hope can cheat no more \u2014 Lavish in promise, laggard in fulfilling \u2014 Where fearless love on every bosom siealing, And boundless knowledge brighten all the shore ; If in that land, when life's old toils are done, And my heart lies as motionless as thine, I still might hope to press that hand in mine, My unoffending \u2014 my offended one ! I would not mourn the health that flies my cheek, I would not mourn my disappointed years, My vain heart mocked and worldly hopes o'erthrov.n But long to meet thee in that land of rest \u2014 \u25a0 Nor deem it joy to breathe in careless ears, A tale of blighted hopes as mournful as thine own.

But he was a humble lowly Irishman, who moped through his sober hours, who associated and dissipated with the human dregs of Dublin, who had as much prudence and common sense as the ostrich, who shrank from publicity and avoided notoriety \u25a0 \u2014 a bookworm, a dreamer, and a drunkard"], [102, "88 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. Like Moore, James Clarence Mangan was the son of a grocer. His father had come to Dublin from the county Limerick, from Shanagolden, had married a Dublin girl, and had set up a little struggling grocery business in Fishamble Street, where James Clarence was born, in 1803. The lad went to a school in a quadrangle off Werburgh Street, called Derby Square \u2014 a place once respectable, but then, as now, of the dingiest, dismallest dreariness. He left school early, and became an office boy in a scrivener's, or attorney's \u2014 an experience he ever afterwards referred to with loathing and horror\u2014 and it is said that out of his paltry wages he maintained a mother and sister and brother. His life, however, about this period is a blank ; he was swamped in misery and poverty, from which he never emerged In r830 he was contri buting translations, from the German and Irish, to a local periodical. He knew not a word of Irish, and, if he had any knowledge of German, how or where he acquired it is a mystery. About this time he became known to Dr. Petrie and Dr. Todd, and was by the latter, who was librarian to the Dublin University, employed to compile a new edition of a catalogue of the college library. From 1S33 he was a constant contributor of translations and quasi-translations to the Penny Journal, published in Dublin, and to the University Magazine, then edited by Isaac Butt. In 1842 he gave his talents to the newly established Nation newspaper, and in 1847 transferred them to the United Irishman. Though not ostensibly one of the band of men who, as Young Irelanders, sought to ' redeem, regenerate, and disenthrall ' their country, he was with them in so far that their sentiments were his, their aims were his hopes, and his pen was employed in their seivice. Amongst the literary young men connected"], [103, "89 MANGAN. with the ' '48 movement,' he had many friends ; but he was not sympathetic or reciprocal \u2014 he was one that scarcely showed that he accepted or appreciated friendly advances. Thus no one seems to have taken much trouble about him ; no one knew whence he came or whither he went. He was ghostly, solitary, silent, and mysterious \u2014 a man with no intimates. Somehow, in the month of June, 1S49, it became known to Mr. O'Daly, a bookseller in Dublin, who had heard of and befriended him, that he was in a wretched condition, grievously ill, in an obscure house in Bride Street, an obscure portion of the city. O'Daly found him, weakened with opium eating and disease, dying of starvation ; had him moved to a hospital, where, after lingering a few days, the un fortunate poet died on the 20th June, 1849. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, where, amongst the abun dant grass, his humble grave is hidden away. It is hard, having read Mangan's poems, to reconcile one's self to the belief that it was the wretched dilapi dated figure that glided through his forty-six years of poverty and drink to the disease and starvation that ter minated his life, who conceived and wrote them. With his old, shapeless, weather-stained cloak round his odd, shapeless figure ; with his long white silken hair un kempt ; with his marble, deathly features, and his great blue eyes abstractedly looking into time or eternity ; shrinking, rather than walking, through the streets \u2014 as such he is still remembered by many. He was to be seen perched on a ladder in the College library, poring over a book for hours, unmoved ; he was to be found before the magistrate, fresh from the police-cells, whither he had been brought drunk and helpless from the gutters. He found relief from his earthly miseries in whisky and"], [104, "90 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. opium ; and despairing and uncomplaining, gentle and affectionate, starving himself to give bread to his women kind, in quiet, speechless obscurity, he wasted the soul within him. There is one ballad written by him on himself \u2014 ' The Nameless One.' It is altogether unlike his other writings. It is a corollary and a supplement to the biography built on the few facts to be ascertained concerning him. It is a cry, a shriek almost, of passionate despair, of utter hopelessness. It is a glance into the soul of him, and a view of the devils tearing to pieces his heart. A few verses of this saddening production will suffice : ' Roll forth, my song, like the rushing river, That sweeps along to the mighty sea ; God will inspire me, while I deliver My soul of thee. * * * * ' And tell how trampled, derided, hated, And worn by weakness, disease, and wrong, lie fled for shelter to God, who mated His soul with song. 'Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love, With spirit shipwrecked, and young hopes blasted, He still, still strove. 'And he fell far through that pit abysmal, The gulf and grave of Maginn and Burns, And pawned his soul for the devil's dismal Stock of returns. ' But yet redeemed it in days of darkness, And shapes and signs of the final wrath, When death, in hideous and ghastly starkness, Stood in his path. * * * * ' And tell how now, amid wreck and sorrow, And want, and sickness, and houseless nights, He bides in calmness the silent morrow, That no ray lights.'"], [105, "MANGAN \u2014 'FATHER PROUT.' 91 But Mangan, as seen in his works, was quite a different mortal. His translations from the German, though not strictly literal, never miss or mar the sentiment, and the language and rhythm are perfect. His pathos is simple and unconstrained ; but, when he attempts humour, it is either buffoonery or the unreal laughter of the clown through his mask. We could quote whole songs from his 'Anthologies,' which, in language and natural melodiousness, far excel the renderings of the same songs by Lord Lytton, Brooks, and others. Notwith standing his mode of life, he was scrupulously pure, even prudish, in his versions and translations. His Irish pieces are well known in his own country, and all he wrote is worthy to be known by all readers of poetry, for they are manifestly the productions of a poet and scholar of refined taste and wide culture. 'FATHER PROUT' The Reverend Francis Sylvester Mahony \u2014 or Father Frank Mahony, as his friends called him ; or Father Prout, as he is known to readers \u2014 is another of the names great in Irish literature which Cork can claim as her own. Of his clerical calling it is enough to say that during his life he did not undertake a cure of souls, and that his later years were clouded by an ever-present remorse at his having obtruded himself into a sacred calling for which he had no vocation. If he had been a lesser man his unclerical life would have entailed on him obloquy, reprehension, censure, from the Catholic Irish people ; but, notwithstanding his unreverend life, not withstanding his contempt for O'Connell, he was regarded with affection by his countrymen ; and his townsmen,"], [106, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 92 ever ready to appreciate and applaud literary ability, were proud of him living, and we hope are proud of him dead. The late Archbishop of Tuam, Dr. MacHale, many years ago reproved one who in his hearing disparaged the unpriestly priest, by saying that ' the Irishman who wrote Father Prout's papers was an honour to his country.' Father Prout did more than this. He sang 'The Bells of Shandon,' a song that everyone has heard; and it is in the fitness of things that, after a wayward, wandering, erratic life, he sleeps near where he was born, beneath the shadow of Shandon Church, beside the bells he made famous. ' Father Frank ' was a member of an old and respected Cork family. He was descended, of course, from the first who, in the mythical times, bore the family name (which, we are told, means in Irish ' a calf of the plain '), through the kings O'Mahony, and so forth. But his im mediate forefathers were of the middle class, and he himself was designed for the priesthood. He was born in 1 804 or 1 805, was educated at France and at Rome, took orders, and became a tutor at Clongowes College. He, however, soon discovered that for neither teaching nor preaching was he adapted, and he resigned \u2014 in effect \u2014 his orders, and embraced literature as his profession. He was a principal writer for J-raser's and Bentley's \u2014 the two chief magazines of the day; and subsequently, in 1846, he became Roman correspondent of the Daily News, of which his friend Charles Dickens was editor. In 1858 he became Paris correspondent of the Globe, and remained so till his death, which occurred in Paris on the iSth of May, 1S66. 'The Reliques of Father Prout,' and 'The Final"], [107, "* FATHER PROUT.' 93 Reliques,' have been read by everyone, and the scholar ship, wit, humour, and pathos with which they abound have been admired, laughed at, and remembered. His knowledge of numerous languages, his extraordinary powers of versifying in foreign tongues, dead and living, his wonderful versatility, always excite and will continue to excite admiration and applause. He was in all respects an extraordinary character. ' He belonged,' says one biographer, ' to a race of mortals now quite gone out of existence, like the elk and wolf-dog.' His personal appearance was remarkable : ' a short, spare man, stooping as he went, with his right arm clasped in the left hand behind him \u2014 a sharp face with piercing grey eyes that looked vacantly upward, a mock ing lip, a close-shaven face, an ecclesiastical garb of slovenly appearance.' He was altogether a Bohemian and a profound scholar, brimful of wit, of sarcasm, of comedy. ' The Bells of Shandon ' was written when he was quite young, a student at the Irish College in Rome. It is said that the opening lines are still to be seen in a room there, scrawled on the wall just above where his bed used to be. At Clongowes, he had in his class John Sheehan, afterwards a well-known contributor to Bcntley's under the name of ' The Irish Whisky Drinker.' He had also among his pupils Frank Stack Murphy (afterwards a serjeant-at-law), in conjunction with whom some of the translations into Greek were made and pub lished. His connection with Frascr's brought him into com panionship with Thackeray, Coleridge, Carlyle, Southey, Lockhart, Dr. Maginn (also a Cork man), Maclise (another Cork man), and others, then and since notable."], [108, "IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. 94 He hated O'Connell, and wrote for the Times a bitter sarcasm on him \u2014 ' The Lay of Lazarus.' Everywhere a wit, nowhere a cleric, always hilarious \u2014 his slovenly, shabby, mendicant garments could not preclude the idea that the bright eyes and ' roguish mouth ' and sudden solitary laugh were traits of an un common individual. He was classed with Hood and Thackeray into the triumvirate of English humourists by a French critic, and his most recent biographer says, justly, of his works : ' They are as exhilarating as the first runnings of a well-filled wine-press, the grapes heaped together in which have been ripened by laughing suns and grown in classic vineyards.' BANIM. John Banim wrote the song or ballad called 'Soggarth Aroon,' and Lord Jeffrey, in a letter, confessed that of the volume of ' Irish Ballad Poetry ' published by Duffy, of all the ' most pathetic and most spirited pieces,' he was 'most struck by \"Soggarth Aroon,\" ' after the two first stanzas. Banim is, however, best known as a novelist ; his 'Tales of the O'Hara Family,' written in conjunction with his brother Michael, his ' Boyne Water,' and other prose works, earned for him the distinction of being once described as Ireland's greatest novelist. He was born on the 3rd of April, 1798, in Kilkenny, where his father was a small shopkeeper, and he mani fested at a very early age a tendency to authorship. We are told he composed and wrote a fairy tale when six years old, and at ten wrote ' poems '! The author, how ever, gave place to the artist, and at eighteen he established himself in Kilkenny, and commenced life with this pro-"], [109, "BANIM. 95 session. A romantic and tragic incident terminated his art-career, and at twenty years of age he moved to Dublin, where he procured a precarious subsistence by fugitive contributions to periodicals. He wrote a poem, ' The Celt's Paradise' ; and plays, ' The Jest' and 'Damon and Pythias,' which were, through Mr. Lalor Sheil's patronage and influence, brought out at Covent Garden. ' The Tales of the O'Hara Family,' the work which is best known, was next published. He married early and settled in London, and met with some success ; so that he could, as we have already mentioned, befriend poor Gerald Griffin in his struggles there. But ill-health and domestic sorrow broke him down, and a charitable sub scription was organised to enable him to visit the Conti nent. The change was of small benefit; in 1835 'he returned to Ireland a complete wreck,' after the burial in France of his only son ; and on his way to his native Kilkenny he was detained at Dublin, where he was ac corded a benefit at the Theatre Royal, at which he was received with every demonstration of honour. He ob tained, on Lord Carlisle's recommendation, a pension of from the Civil List and an allowance for his daughter's education. He died on 1st August, r842, at Kilkenny, aged forty-four, and was buried in the grave yard of St. John's there. John Banim has been called the ' Scott of Ireland,' not alone because his novels were founded on national themes, but because he was a palpable imitator of Scott's style. He is sometimes tiresome in his descriptions, and he fails to represent the higher social classes; but his portrayal of the Irish peasantry has never been equalled. He dwells in his novels too much on the horrible ; the worst and darkest human passions are too ready to his"], [110, "96 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. imagination, but they are the works of a man of genius, and were recognised as such when they were published. As a dramatist, his ' Damon and Pythias ' is celebrated ; and as a song-writer, ' Soggarth Aroon ' and the few others we quote will prove him to be not the least of the tribe. KEEGAN. John Keegan was the son of a peasant in the Queen's County, and was born about 1809. What his method of teaching himself was, or what opportunities of learning he possessed beyond the local hedge-school, are to be conjectured ; but he seems to have somehow acquired a considerable amount of knowledge, of a plain but service able character. He was, while yet a young man, a well known writer of ballads for the Nation newspaper, and a contributor of sketches and tales to an Irish journal called Dolman's Magazine ; and these, with his songs \u2014 which are marked by pathetic simplicity, tenderness, and purity, and show a remarkable insight of the feelings and affections of his class \u2014 were written in the intervals of his peasant labours. He died in 1849, 'happy,' says Mr. Hayes, ' to die amongst the people whose privations he shared, and the hard realities of whose daily life he illus trated by his prose writings and songs. He was a poor man who wrote for bread \u2014 a \"peasant poet.\" ' FRASER.

Considering that throughout his life he worked at his trade diligently, that he was a martyr to ill-health, that he was in straitened circum stances, his writings are numerous, and manifest a power and culture which are remarkable. Had he been affluent, with time to cultivate his talents and tastes, he would have been one of the foremost of Irish verse-writers. He is best at descriptive poetry, and shows a sympa thetic appreciation of rural nature. The songs in which he celebrates the localities familiar to his childhood are marked by a quiet, but vivid beauty. His political verses are powerful and enthusiastic, but generous and tolerant, and his lines on the death of Thomas Davis are of a high order of excellence. He was held in affectionate esteem by his literary acquaintances, led a retired and blameless life \u2014 a noble and simple piety is apparent in his writings \u2014 and he died in 1849, in Dublin, at the age of forty. His poems were collected and published after his death. WALSH. ' Poor Walsh ! he has a family of young children, he seems broken in health and spirits ; ruin has been on his tracks for years, and I think has him in the wind at last. There are more contented galley-slaves moiling at Spike than the schoolmaster. Perhaps the man really does envy me, and most assuredly I do not envy him.' These are the words written by John Mitchell in his Jail sournal, upon an interview he had when a political prisoner in Spike Island, with Edward Walsh, the author of many ' sweet songs and of some very musical transla tions from Irish ballads.' and the schoolmaster of the 7"], [112, "98 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. juvenile convicts in penal servitude on Spike Island \u2022A tall, gentlemanlike person, in black but rather over worn clothes,' with tears in his eyes on the occasion of this interview, Mitchell describes him. 'He stooped down and kissed my hands, and said I was the man in Ireland most to be envied.' Soon after this episode Walsh was promoted to the schoolmastership of the Cork Workhouse, and after a short interval further promoted to where the inexorable ruin could not overtake him, and where he could rest, for ever released from the moiling worse than that of the convict galley-slave. The sickening drudgery at which death found him was the only means of livelihood given to a man who left two volumes of translations from Irish poetry, who was himself a not insignificant poet, was an accomplished scholar in the Irish language and literature, ' and a man of pure heart and sterling sentiment' Edward Walsh's father was a small farmer in the county Cork who had eloped with a girl much above him in social status. He relinquished farming owing to pecuniary straits and enlisted in the militia, and was quartered with his regiment in Londonderry in 1805, when his son was born. When the corps was disbanded the father returned to Cork, and here Edward was edu cated. His education must have been beyond the average of his class, for he received an appointment as a private tutor while still a young man. He subsequently kept a school in Millstreet, in the county Cork, whence in 1837 he removed to pursue the same occupation in Toureen, in county Waterford. He diligently and re solutely devoted himself to the study of his native language, and perfected the knowledge obtained from books by constant intercourse with the Irish-speaking"], [113, "WALSH. 99 peasants. He translated the Irish songs and poems accessible to him, and began to publish them in various magazines while at Toureen. These were of such merit, so literal, idiomatic, and characteristic, and withal so melodious, that they attracted the attention, amongst others, of the present Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, and through his friendship and interest Walsh was appointed sub-editor of the Dublin Monitor. For some unassigned reason he resigned this post, which, from the advantages it offered \u2014 time for literary labour and opportunities for his special study \u2014 should have been of superlative value to him. He then published a collection of his own poems and his translations under the title of ' Jacobite Relics of Ireland ;' and next he is engaged at the dreary and, to him, degrading task of instructing the juvenile convict criminals at Spike Island. Thence to the Cork Workhouse School, whereon the 6th April, 1850, he died, aged forty-five. He was, we are told, ' A shy, sensitive creature,' and the man who wrote his songs spent the best part of his life teaching rogues and paupers their ' Reading made easy' It is a biographical record of singular sad ness and inappropriateness. No wonder he was ' broken in health and spirits,' and that ' ruin had him in the wind at last,' when Mitchell saw him in his wretched office at the convict depot Mr. Hayes says of his writings : ' His contributions to Irish literature have been both considerable and credit able ; there is a singular beauty and fascinating melody in his verse which cheers and charms the ear and heart. His translations preserve all the peculiarities of the old tongue, which he knew and spoke with graceful fluency.'

LADY DUFFERIN. It is no exageration to say that Lady Dufferin as a song writer has not been surpassed by any Irish author, ancient or modern. She is a conspicuous example of the trans mission of genius from generation to generation. In her family it has been hereditary. She not only inherited it, but transmitted it. Her son, the present Earl of Dufferin, is a worthy descendant of an illustrious ancestor. The authoress of the song ' I'm sitting on the stile, Mary,' was Helen Selina Blackwood, and though she was at her death the Countess of Gifford, she is best known as Lady Dufferin. She was the eldest daughter of Thomas Sheridan, who was son of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, a brief biography of whom has already appeared in these pages. She was born in 1807, and her earlier years were spent at Hampton Court Palace, where her mother resided after the death of Thomas Sheridan. She, in common with her two sisters, was a noted beauty, and she married on 6th July, 1825, the Honourable Price Blackwood, afterwards Lord Dufferin, an Irish nobleman, and her only son, born in 1826, is the present Earl of Dufferin, well-known in the diplomatic and literary world. While still very young she, in conjunction with her sister Caroline, afterwards the Hon. Mrs. Norton, pub lished 'The Dandies' Rout,' which was written and illustrated by the two girls. Her husband died in 1841, and in 1862 Lady Dufferin married the Earl of Gifford, eldest son of the Marquis"], [115, "LADY DUFFERIN \u2014 MRS.

If she had written nothing but ' The Irish Emigrant,' ' I'm sitting on the stile, Mary,' her fame as a poet had been established. This, and all her songs and ballads, were prompted not by the ambition for fame, but because of a kindly, hearty, and warm sympathy with the best qualities of the people to which she belonged, and amongst whom she dwelt She has entered into the ways and thoughts of the Irish, and penetrated into their heart of hearts. The pathos of ' The Emigrant,' and the humour of ' Terence's Farewell ' and ' Katie's Letter,' are alike entirely Irish. Most, if not all, of her songs were published anonymously, and no collection of them has yet appeared, an injustice to her memory and a loss to Irish literature. Lady Dufferin was also a composer ; she wrote the music for her own song ' Sweet Kilkenny Town :' and she was the author of a prose work, 'The Honourable Impulsia Gushington,' a humorous and light satire on the ways and doings of nineteenth-century fashion. This was written to relieve the weariness and depression of a long sickness of ' a beloved friend' But it is on her Irish songs her brightest fame rests, and it will remain undimmed as long as songs are sung. MRS. NORTON. Mrs. Norton was sister to Lady Dufferin, and had also a large share of the Sheridan heritage of intellectual power ; but the life-history of the two is strangely diverse. Helen Selina Sheridan had a happy uneventful life. Caroline Sheridan's was indeed eventful, but calamitous and unhappy."], [116, "IRISH SONGS AND' SONG-WRITERS. 102 In 1827, on 30th July, she was married to the Hon. George C. Norton, a brother of the third Lord Grantley \u2014 a barrister, and afterwards Recorder of Guildford. She was vivacious, genial, intellectual, enthusiastic : he was a rake who ill-treated her \u2014 conceited, without brains \u2014 poor, without industry \u2014 a very ordinary personage altogether, but the very reverse of what Caroline Sheridan's husband should be. The husband-drone, shameful and shame less, compelled her to write to earn money for him \u2014 compelled her to solicit for him an appointment from Lord Melbourne. Her acquaintance with Lord Mel bourne, thus originated, was the cause of one of the most unfortunate and the most notorious episodes in her varied life. He had an unsympathetic wife (as Lady Caroline Lamb she is best known), and Mrs. Norton had a contemptible husband ; but both had high intellectual tastes and accomplishments, and their dispositions were alike genial and amiable, but vivacious and brilliant. Lord Melbourne granted her request, and appointed her husband a police-magistrate in London. But he was utterly unfit by manner and capacity for such a post ; he was quarrelsome and ignorant, and neglected his duty. He was in pecuniary difficulties, and sought loans from Lord Melbourne ; and, being refused, he revenged him self by instituting an action for divorce, making the minister co-respondent, and claiming from him ,\u00a310,000 damages. The suit was scouted out of court ; the jury found for the defendants without leaving the box, and Mrs. Norton separated finally from her paltry consort.

She wrote novels and tales, a tragedy called ' The Martyr,' and filled up her literary life with numerous and am bitious poems. Her later writings are didactic, and aimed at effecting some social reforms ; some of them are full of references to her own unhappy life. She was one of the most brilliant ornaments of London society before she retired into seclusion. She everywhere commanded the pity and sympathy which should arise in her behalf wherever her husband was known. She occupied and deserved a con spicuous place in contemporary literature ; and though there is a staginess about her style, and though she fails in that in which Lady Dufferin excels \u2014 the subtle power to be en rapport with the heart's best sympathies \u2014 yet she has in her poems, and in her songs, maintained with credit the Sheridan mental heritage which devolved upon her. M'GEE. Thomas Darcy M'Gee was, with Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, the only one of all the young Irishmen im plicated in the futile movement of 1848 whose after career gave exercise for a display of the abilities which were, in their own country, unhappily misdirected into Ihe channel of revolution in their youth. The tragic termination of M'Gee's life \u2014 his assassination while at the height of his fame and popularity in Canada \u2014 is still fresh in the public mind. His maturer years had taught him the folly of his youth. In the Government of Canada"], [118, "104 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. he attained to ministerial office; he went over to loyalty; he denounced with eloquent vehemence the aims and ways of those who still adhered to the insurrectionary ideas which ruled his own early years ; he poured power ful contempt and derision on the Fenian organisation, and he thus aroused the vengeance of that body against him, and on the night of the 7th April, 1868, he was murdered. He was a native of the county Monaghan, and was born on the 13th April, 1825 ; the son of an official in the Irish Coastguard Service, by a Miss Morgan, daughter of a Dublin bookseller. In 1842 he emigrated to America, and having attracted some notice by a speech made by him there, on the occasion of the celebration of the Year of the American Independence, he was employed on the literary staff of the Boston Pilot \u2014 an influential journal \u2014 of which he became editor in 1844, before he had attained his twentieth year. His public speeches, marked by fire and eloquence, carried his name to Ireland; andO'Connell described one of them as an inspired utterance by an exiled Irish boy. He returned to Ireland, and joined the staff of the Freeman's Journal, and became editor of it. But his political opinions were, at that time, far in advance of the then moderate and cautious Freeman, and he therefore went over to the Nation, the newspaper then under the editorship of Gavan Duffy. He entered heartily into the political spirit enunciated so ably by this journal, and he became its sub-editor, and so con tinued till its suppression in 1848. His ability and energy procured him the secretaryship of the ' Young Ireland Confederation.' He was employed as a public orator throughout Ireland, and despatched to Scotland to awaken public feeling in favour of the movement. He"], [119, "m'gee. 105 was arrested because of a wild speech on its behalf made in Wicklow, but was released after a brief incarceration ; and when the resort to arms took place in 1848, he was in Scotland, promoting the objects of the confederation. He was immediately nominated for arrest, and a reward \u00b0f offered for his apprehension. Yet he returned to Ireland to see his newly-married wife ; and, under the protection of a high ecclesiastic, he contrived, in the dis guise of a clergyman, to make good his escape to Phila delphia, where he landed on the roth October. He established a journal, the Nation, in New York, and devoted its pages to blaming the Irish priesthood for the failure of the Young Ireland Movement. He soon abandoned the New York Nation, and started the American Celt in Boston. Up to this period the senti ments of the revolutionist still animated him ; but now they toned down, and he seems to have regarded them as a blunder. In 1858, still a young man, he left the States and settled in Montreal ; was elected to the Canadian Parlia ment, where his eloquence and administrative ability soon made him a conspicuous member of the Legislature. In 1862 he became President of the Executive Committee, and subsequently obtained the portfolio of the Minister of Agriculture. During his official career he wrote his 'History of Ireland' In 1865 he was in Ireland as representative from Canada at the Dublin Exhibition ; and during his sojourn, while on a visit to his father, in the county Wexford, delivered a philippic against the then widespread Fenian organisation, and descanted upon the degraded lives led by the Irish in the United States. In 1867 he revisited Europe, this time as the Dominion representative at the Paris Exposition, and, on his return,"], [120, "106 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. promoted the beneficent scheme of consolidation of the Canadian Colonies. He was publicly entertained in Montreal, on St. Patrick's Day, 1868, in consideration of liis services to the State ; and a few weeks later, on the 7th April, almost immediately after a brilliant speech in the Parliament, he was assassinated. Thus was he re warded for having forsaken the paths of revolution, for having recanted so openly and reviled so consistently and furiously his old political creeds ; for having, in season and out of season, with tongue and pen, persistently opposed and denounced the Fenian organisation. As a parliamentary orator his eloquence was of a high order, and as a politician he possessed many statesman like attributes. As a literary man he was throughout his life industrious, and his writings are not of an ephemeral character. He wrote a ' History of Ireland,' sundry works in connection with the Irish settlers in America, and the ' Lives of Irish Writers.' His poems fill a volume; and his songs, most of which belong to his earlier life, are national in their tone \u2014 impulsive, ardent, enthusiastic \u2014 are full of life and dignity, and marked by an undoubted sincerity. ' His poetry,' wrote Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, who knew him well, ' touches me like the breath of spring, and revives the buoyancy and chivalry of youth.' WILLIAMS. Richard Dalton Williams was the son of a Tipperary farmer who lived at Grenanstown, at the foot of the Devil's Bit Mountains. Hayes says he was born there ; others say he was born in Dublin ; but of the place and of the time there is doubt. It is believed he was born"], [121, "WILLIAMS. 107 about the year 1822. He was educated at Tullabeg School, and went thence to Carlow College, which he left to become a medical student in Dublin. He was a con tributor to the Nation, was involved in the 1848 move ment, and, after John Mitchell's conviction and the suppression of the United Irishman paper, Williams assisted O'Doherty in establishing the Irish Tribune, a journal of the same character. It was speedily sup pressed \u2014 before its sixth number \u2014 and O'Doherty was tried for sedition, convicted, and transported to Australia. Williams escaped, the jury in his case acquitting him, or disagreeing. He now resumed his medical studies, and received a diploma from the Edinburgh University. Armed with this he emigrated to America, in 1850. He practised at his profession in New Orleans for some time, but with indifferent success. He became Professor of Belles Lettres in Spring Hill College \u2014 an educational institution at Mobile, in Alabama. He did not long con tinue at this work, but moved to Louisiana, to again practise medicine at Thibodeaux. Here, on 5th July, 1862, he fell a victim to consumption, a disease which had afflicted him since his youth. He died in utter poverty and loneliness, and his burial-place was marked by a piece of board for a monument, until some Irish- American soldiers, passing through the locality, heard of and saw the grave, and they raised over his ashes a fitting and enduring memorial. Williams was one of the ablest of the young men who in those troubled times of 1848 gathered together and raised aloft a new standard to eclipse O'Connell. His first poem which appeared in the Nation newspaper \u2014 the organ of the Young Irelanders \u2014 was ' The Munster War-Song,' and was written while he was at Carlow"], [122, "108 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. College, still in his teens. He wrote much while in Dublin, and embellished all he wrote with a playful wit, a grotesque humour, an affectionate sympathy \u2014 all lit up by a wide and varied knowledge and a cultivated in telligence. His verses on 'The Dying Girl' were written after a visit to one of the Dublin hospitals. His ' Song of the Irish American Regiments ' was written in America, when he was fired to enthusiasm by the outbreak of the Civil War. 'Tears lie in him and a consuming fire,' wrote a kindly, friendly critic. ' There is in him the gentleness and trembling pity of a woman, and the deep earnestness and passionate ardour of the hero.' And he died an exile, struggling vainly for bread, weighed down into his grave by relentless disease, aggravated by poverty bordering on starvation. He is to be numbered amongst the unfortunates in Irish literature who saw no good in their own days \u2014 a humorous man withal throughout, who did not end his days in peace. CASEY. In Ireland during the century the literature of rebellion has been prolific in songs, many of which, especially those of 1848, are of more than average merit. The Fenian conspiracy of 1866 was almost exclusively con fined to the proletariat, and was conspicuous, in com parison with previous revolutionary movements, for its utter literary deficiency. There are one or two still living who were connected with it, and whose songs will be preserved ; but of those who are dead there was but one \u2014 John Keegan Casey \u2014 who as a song-writer deserves to be remembered. When but twenty years of age he col-"], [123, "CASEY 109 lected and published those effusions which he had con tributed to various journals, and the volume was a success. In 1869, when twenty-three years old, he published another book of poems, ' The Rising of the Moon,' the contents of which were of the ultra-national type. The London Review in commenting on this volume said, ' Treason is put in a fascinating, tolerant, and in telligent shape, and no Saxon could feel over-vexed at being railed at so eloquently in his own language.' This was written of the work of a peasant's son, who died when twenty-three and a half years of age ; who had seen the inside of a prison as a rebel ; and whose love-songs are even preferable to his rebel-songs. He was born in 1846 at Mount Dalton, in the county Westmeath, where his father was a peasant-farmer; he had a taste for learning, and few opportunities for gratify ing it He tried a shopboy's life, but abandoned it for literature and sedition. As a lad, before he was sixteen, he was a contributor to the Nation 'Poet's Corner,' and under the nom de plume of ' Leo,' wrote frequently and welL The literary ability of all his songs, and the tender simplicity of his love-songs, are very remarkable in one such as he.

And when he stowed away his ' bag,' Cross-barred with green and yellow, I thought and said, ' In Ireland's ground There's not so fine a fellow.' And Fineen Burke, and Shaun Magee, And Eily, Kate, and Mary, Rushed in, with panting haste, to see And welcome Caoch O'Leary. Oh, God be with those happy times ! Oh, God be with my childhood !

And how I wept when he said, ' Farewell, And think of Caoch O'Leary !' And seasons came and went, and still Old Caoch was not forgotten, Although we thought him dead and gone, And in the cold grave rotten ; And often, when I walked and talked With Eily, Kate, and Mary, We thought of childhood's rosy hours, And spoke of Caoch O'Leary. Well, twenty summers had gone past, And June's red sun was sinking, When I, a man, sat by my door, Of twenty sad things thinking. A little dog came up the way, His gait was slow and weary, And at his tail a lame man limped \u2014 'Twas ' Pinch ' and Caoch O'Leary 1 Old Caoch, but oh, how wobegone !

'Yes, yes,' I said ; \u2014 the wanderer wept As if his heart was breaking. 'And where, a vie ?na chree,'* he sobbed, ' Is all the merry-making I found here twenty years ago ?'

And soon the old man stopt speaking, And rage, which had not gone by, From under his brows, came breaking Up into his enemy's eye ;"], [342, "328 IRISH SONGS AND SONG-WRITERS. And now his limbs were not shaking, But his clench'd hands his bosom cross'd, And he looked a fierce wish to be taking Revenge for the boy he had lost ! But the old man he looked around him, And thought of the place he was in, And thought of the promise which bound him, And thought that revenge was sin \u2014 And then, crying tears, like a woman, ' Your hand !' he said \u2014 ' ay, that hand ! And I do forgive you, foeman, For the sake of our bleeding land !' John Banim, AILLEEN. 'Tis not for love of gold I go, 'Tis not for love of fame ; Though fortune should her smile bestow, And I may win a name, Ailleen, And I may win a name. And yet it is for gold I go, And yet it is for fame, That they may deck another brow, And bless another name, Ailleen, And bless another name."], [343, "AILLEEN. 329 For this, but this, I go \u2014 for this I lose thy love awhile ; And all the soft and quiet bliss Of thy young, faithful smile, Ailleen, Of thy young, faithful smile. And I go to brave a world I hate, And woo it o'er and o'er, And tempt a wave, and try a fate Upon a stranger shore, Ailleen, Upon a stranger shore. Oh, when the bays are all my own, I know a heart will care ! Oh, when the gold is wooed and won, I know a brow shall wear, Ailleen, I know a brow shall wear ! And when with both returned again, My native land to see, I know a smile will meet me there, And a hand will welcome me, Ailleen, And a hand will welcome me ! John Banim."], [344, "INDEX.
