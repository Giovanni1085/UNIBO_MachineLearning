THE following crude pages, amidst the multipli city of more important engagements, were originally thrown together in much haste, for the exclusive pur pose of amusing the Author's own pupils, in their lei sure moments, and their friends during the vacations: and as he conceives it is no minor duty of a preceptor to shew the young people entrusted to his care how to blend utility with amusement, or rather that amuse ment and utility should be inseparable, he has endea voured to give those Essays such a turn and modifica tion, as may, in some degree, direct the young Tyro's attention to those subjects which ought principally to engage it, and at the same time facilitate the address, nduce a just notion of morals and manners, and strengthen the memory. b"], [16, "VI The Author has committed his efforts to the press, not from the vain presumption, that they can endure the scrutiny, or are worthy the notice of Criticism, but to spare the time and fatigue of writing out reite rated copies for recitation. However, should any gentleman of the Author's profession consider them worthy of an introduction into his school, he will certainly be at liberty, now they are before the Public, to do so; and the Author will be gratified in having contributed his tiny trifle towards the assistance of that respectable and laborious class of the community, and to the benefit of that sa cred deposit, for the best interests of which they are so seriously responsible. A slight alteration in some of the pieces, by way of change of initial or appellation, and a grammatical particle or two, will adapt them to general and perpe tual use. It will be immediately perceived, that irony is the prominent characteristic of these recitations, by which"], [17, "VII an effective instrument is put into the hand of the youth, who unconsciously becomes his own discipli narian. A magical mirror is presented before him, in which he discovers himself as he is, with the absur dities of his childish notions, and the extravagancies of youthful importunities. A word, perhaps, may be necessary, in reference to the structure of the piece, entitled \" Strictures,\" &c. It assumes something of the semblance of the dra matic, but it is in semblance only. It will be readily seen by the judicious eye, that almost every definite feature of the drama is wanting, and that a simple dialogue may as legitimately be termed theatrical as the piece in question; it being nothing more than a Colloquy, supported by several individuals. The subject and conduct of their conference reject all comment as well as apology from the Author. That which is right needs no apology, and that which is wrong no apology can either justify or palliate. Before the only competent tribunal, namely, a can- b2"], [18, "VIII did aud enlightened Public, the pert Lilliputian, ac cording to his merits or demerits, must stand or fall. and to the decision of that tribunal, he will feel it his duty to bow with cheerful acquiescence, \u2014 or, thankful acknowledgments.

I must protest, I'd rather be excused ; \u2014 But Ladies' wishes ne'er may be refused : Courage recovers when the fair invite ; We breathe new energies and fresh delight.

Those smiles suspended, dismal night pervades, And throws our whole horizon into shades: B"], [20, "2 A night whose horrors make the stoutest start, \u2014 And strikes a terror thro' the boldest heart !

Apollo's lyre warbles a soft assent, And vibrates every chord of \u2014 \" Heart's Content.\" The Loves and Graces lend a listening ear, And wonder what new song this is they hear. Forth from their flowery grots they gather round, ln mute amazement, catch the fleeting sound. Descending on an Iris, Fancy flies, As all her varied forms the mimic tries : While young Imagination wildly waves Her magic sceptre o'er the youth she loves. Tenacious Memory mingles with the throng, Humbly soliciting a sober song. The airy Goddesses assenting smile, And their wild frenzied notes suspend awhile.

Some of the brightest sons of Genius here Love learning as their favourite atmosphere ; Who spurn the stigma of a blockhead's name, And stand fair candidates for lettered fame.

Mark this, ye lawless boys, Who love the name of looby, \u2014 Who scorn all other joys, But such as please a booby !

Who would not join our happy dynasty. \" Aye, aye,\" some flogging pedagogue would say, \" You little rogues, were you under my sway, \" I'd teach you how to have your will and way; \" I'd cane and flog you nineteen times a day.\" You might do so, kind sir, but Mr. R.

What ! ten long lines at once in this thick block ! Oh no ! there never can be room for such a stock. Besides, what use in all this rhetoric stuff; Surely, each child by nature knows enough. I've passed by Billingsgate, and seen the wenches there, Foam, stamp, and bellow, chatter, bounce, and swear In strains of stormy eloquence beyond compare. And pray, who taught these orators their rules? Think ye they ever learned their arts in schools. \u2014 Ah, Sir !

They could not bear to see their darling weep, But beg you to excuse the child, \u2014 and let him go to sleep. But, if the rhetoric of tears will not avail, Ah ! let me hope sound argument will prevail, To banish from your school such useless arts As boys think useless, and which grieve their hearts. Surely, good sense and reason make it plain, \u2014 Children should nothing learn that gives them pain. I need not, Sir, instruct yon in these things, That boys should hg.ve their will and way, like Indian Kings. What trouble it would spare you, what bustle, and what fuss, To sit supinely at your desk, and leave the whole to us. If studies were neglected, for mischief, sport, and noise, You'd say, \"all must be quite correct that please my play- ful boys.\" Trust me, good Sir, that nothing is more true, Preceptors should not govern as they do : C2"], [34, "16 Boys should be governors, make laws, and rule, And manage all the\u2014 -mischief of the school. Schoolmasters nothing rightly can discern : They think that school 's the place where boys should learn ! Why, yes ; and so they should learn \u2014 what they please, But nothing that would interrupt their ease. Now, if you'll give me leave, Sir, I'll just shew How wrong your system is, all thro' and thro' : First, in the morn, the moment we're down stairs, Brush hair, wash teeth, read Bible, go to prayers \u2014 A pretty plan, indeed, thus to begin the day \u2014 We 'd rather have a right good game at play.

Instead of which, long lessons next take place, Sad harbingers of many a rueful face. These tasks got thro', the breakfast bell now sounds, And bread and milk heals all our morning wounds.

I do, most dotingly; and therefore, to give full evidence that my affection is worthy of the name, I have, from his infancy, given free scope to indulgence, and allowed his generous nature unlimited license.

My friendship could allow of no better construc tion ; and, as to the second part of your charge against me, of inflicting a wound on human nature, I plead innocent in toto. The wound, my good friend, was there long before. You and I came into the world smarting under its incurable rankling, and indented with its disgraceful scars. Sir W. No preaching, my good friend, \u2014 no preaching, for God's sake : we have quite enough of that from our worthy rector, once a week. Pray leave the puritan behind, when you honour me with your company. Mr. C. I would, for \" God's sake,\" your sake, and your son's sake, either preach, pray, or hold my peace, if, by any means, I could convince you of your error in judgment, or save your ill-biassed son from ultimate ruin. .Sir W.

I am truly happy, my lord, to learn how well you approve your son's school ; and that you are satisfied with his progress in the more elegant branches of literature. But a common school, my Lord, I conceive, should be the receptacle of common people only, who should not blend with nobility. Lord M. Prejudice, prejudice alone, believe me. General. Can you, my Lord, substantiate your assertion ? Lord M. Most readily, General. General. I am impatient to hear it. Lord M. Well, General, what constitutes education, but that which falls under the three following heads, viz. Sci ence, Virtue, and Behaviour ? General. True, my Lord; but how is such a consumma-"], [98, "80 tion to be attained in a mere plebeian establishment; or, indeed, any where, but in public schools, such as E**n, R***y, H****w, W*********r, and the rest. Lady M. I much fear, General, that there is but a scanty modicum of virtue to be gleaned at any of the public schools. General. I am happy to find that Lady Mannerly acknow ledges that there are some gleanings, which at least implies, that there is at some seasons a harvest. Lady M. The scythe of your wit, General, is too keen in retort. Perhaps my expression might have borne a posi tive and negative construction. General. It was not my part, Madam, to apply your pri vate construction, you know ; \u2014 Was it, my Lord ? Lord M. Oh, no, no, no! You are right, General, in availing yourself of every finesse, in your professional skill in tactics : particularly when you are upon the defensive. Lady M. My dear Lord, I have interrupted your friendly discussion. \u2014 General, I must ask your pardon: pray pro ceed. Lord M. I believe the General challenged me to shew, how virtue and solid education, gentlemanly behaviour, and so forth, can be acquired any where but in public schools. General. A challenge, my Lord, in which I confidently anticipate an easy victory."], [99, "81 Lord M. I will undermine that confidence, by hinting my suspicions, whether those grand principles in question may not be found any where sooner than at public schools. General. You are severe, my Lord, \u2014 you are extremely severe. Lord M. I would neither be severe nor unjust, in my re marks upon those institutions. I would not detract from that celebrity which they have legitimately acquired ; for I myself received a part of my education in one of them. General. Then I am sure, Sir, your gratitude will induce you to speak favourably of them. Lord M. My regard for truth and morality will compel me to discriminate between the good and evil ; and to develop the predominant average of the one over the other. General. Aye, aye, my Lord ! but you forget the old adage, \" that the truth should not always be spoken.\" Lady M. 0, General ! \u2014 What, what, staggering already ! Is this the first symptom of your anticipated victory ? General. Madam, you are too hard upon me. I did not include you in the challenge. When three are engaged in a conflict, it cannot be termed a duel, you know. Lady M. He, He ! \u2014 Pardon me, good Sir ! \u2014 Do pray go on : there is certainly no need of my assistance ! Lord M. As I just now observed, Sir, I should be sorry"], [100, "82 that any of my observations should unjustly detract from any of their well-earned celebrity ; but I must insist upon it, from my own personal experience, and the knowledge I have ac quired of those schools, that morality finds no temple, virtue no shrine, in either of them. General. V/orse and worse. Lord M. Still worse, Sir. I am warranted to affirm, that vice is the goddess of the whole group, from which her adorers issue, spreading unlimited her baleful contagion into the remotest precincts of the general community. General. 0, my good Lord ! \u2014 You are zealous, you are \u2014 Lord M. Profane, you perhaps might say; but truth, Ge neral, never was indebted to prejudice or custom, and is too dignified to retire abashed at the insolent nod of their arro gated power. General. My lord, you will make but very few proselytes, I presume. Lord M. That has nothing to do with the question. I am not contending for mere victory, nor am I in quest of disci ples, but my aim is to exhibit simple and incontrovertible facts. General. You are a firm combatant. I am prepared for the next shot, my Lord. \u2014 Come, have at me ! Lord M. I then must repeat, that the vices which are im-"], [101, "83 bibed, the contagion of bad example, the danger of contract ing profligate habits, the impudence and familiarity, the dar ing hardihood which obtain in those schools, (I must forbear naming particulars,) absolutely overwhelm the feeble strug gles, (if any struggles there be,) of expiring virtue. General. You will not surely, my lord, go so far as to say that no kind of benefit results from those celebrated institu tions ! Lord M. By no means ; learning should have her seat there \u2014 I might say her throne ; and the masters might dignify and adorn it ; but the radical errors lie in the arrangements and economy of those institutions \u2014 are alike common to all ; and the comparative benefit derived is absorbed in the pre ponderating mass of evil. General. These are strong allegations, Lord M. You could, by your own personal recollection, confirm those allegations, were you not so biassed by public prejudice. Lady M. I very much disapprove of their mode of disci pline: there I understand the pupils are treated more like malefactors than gentlemen. Lord M.

General. O ! they take care not to hurt the delinquents much, who don't mind it; they just make a wry face or two, and then go laughing to their desks. Lord M. If it be not an instrument of terror why use it at all? General. What are you to do then if you banish the rod? Lord M. Let the masters attend more assiduously to the formation of their pupils' habits and to their mental progress, if they wish to supersede castigation. I am persuaded, that it is the negligence and foolish adherence to old rules and customs, and the wish to spare trouble and forethought, which oblige the heads of our academical establishments to use the argumentum ad podicem in preference to the argumentum ad judicium."], [103, "85 Lady M. I have, I think, heard you say, that a great master of rhetoric, and a Roman teacher, in an oration still extant, explodes the practice of flogging. Lord M. Quintillian, \u2014 certainly, \u2014 aye, one of his obser vations is well deserving the attention of our knights of the rod, who make such havoc with that vile instrument: \u2014 \" De nique cum parvulum verberibus coegeris, quid juveni faicias, cui nee adhiberi potest hie metus, et majora discenda sunt.\" Lady M.

Well, my lord, I believe I must concede the flogging system to you, because I did not coidially like the exercise of the cauterizing instrument myself, when at school. But what further objections can you urge against our seats of literature ? Lord M. That things act by contraries there.

Hey, my Lord ! you have drawn me out of my depth there ; I do not understand you. i"], [104, "86 Lord M. My meaning is simply, that the most useful prin ciples of education are slighted, if not wholly neglected, for studies of less practical utility. The English language and English literature, elocution, arithmetic, and, indeed, every other home study and scientific branch of knowledge, are despised as plebeian intruders into classical schools. General. Lord Mannerly is himself too good a classic, I'm sure, to run down the literature of Greece and Rome. You do yourself an injustice, my Lord. Lord M. I neither depreciate my own share of classical acquirement, nor do I, in the least, undervalue ancient lite rature. \u2014 What I insist upon is, that we should study things rather than sounds \u2014 science rather than mere words. What are the objects of a language, what is the utility of words ? Is not a language a vehicle by which we are conveyed to an acquaintance1 with things.

If that is an axiom, why, then, how is it that the enlightened conductors of our public seminaries cultivate sound and forget the thing, \u2014 urge on the splendid vehicle, regardless of the treasure it contains.

Madam, you do me too much honour. I shall study to repay you. Lord M. Well, my dear friend, as you, at this moment, are so desirous to hear plain English, in preference to sound ing metaphor and extrinsic ornament, how comes it to pass that you are allied with public prejudice to leave the English language to limp along in the rear of literature, neglected and discarded. Lady M. O, O, General ! I am sorry for you. That was a terrible knock, poor gentleman ! Lord M. What, allow me to ask, is the end and object of books ? \u2014 Are they not a medium through which we acquire a right judgment of things, rather than words ; through which a thousand lessons may be presented to our notice ? Let them, therefore, be used to form the principles and manners of our youth, and not merely to teach the sounds of dead languages. Let the licentious authors and sentiments, both is"], [106, "88 Greek and Latin, be banished and expunged from your favo rite schools. Lady M. I have heard many gentlemen say, that they im bibed the first taint of gaiety and corruption from certain passages in some of the classic authors. I must confess, 1 should be very sorry were our dear boy to have such danger ous excitements thrown in his way in his elementary pro gress, more especially by his preceptor. Lord M. O ! it is notorious, (and our friend is as deeply versed in the fact as I am,) that the productions of Anacreon, Aristophanes, Horace, and Juvenal, contain matter which it is shameful for an adult to allow himself to read ; and yet these are the books which are not only tolerated, but encou raged in these celebrated schools. Lady M. Nothing surely but a mistaken pride of having it known to have been educated in those modish seminaries, could induce any one to countenance them, under their per nicious arrangements. You will excuse me, General ; I have no idea of any thing like personality; for I have not the ho nour of knowing where you acquired your juvenile advan tages. [General bows.] Lord M. O, I declare, I blush at the bare recollection of passages which I have read in my boyhood. These execra-"], [107, "89 ble pages, which are open to boys \" in statu puplllari,\" the authors of which kept within no limits. General. You have, my Lord, forgotten Sancho's proverb, \" the truth should not all be spoken.\" Lady M. What ! shrinking again, most puissant knight ! Lord M. Nothing was too filthy, too monstrous, for them to dilate upon ; no mysteries too sacred to investigate, no thing unforbidden which they did not transgress. Those au thors gave names to what ought to have been nameless, ex istence to worse than bestial abominations, and excused or recommended the vilest practices to which fallen humanity can surrender itself. Lady M. These, then, are the sages which are the ho noured guides of our youth. What: is it because \" there is no prophet in Israel;\" no Christian author to be found, ade quate to inform and adorn the juvenile mind ; but we must be beholden to Pagans and Pagan depravity? \u2014 Must we sharpen the edge of our wit, and give point to our literary weapons, at the forges of these degenerated Philistines ! General. A truce, my Lord, a truce in one moment, un less this fair formidable retire from the fight. Upon my ho nour, it is unfair. Lord M. General, you must acknowledge these are la mentable facts. 13"], [108, "90 General. I know there is a great deal of stuff in those au thors, which might as well never have been handed down to posterity; but you will allow, that much beautiful writing, many exquisite touches of nature, and some of the finest poetical effusions, would be lost, if these books were entirely banished from great schools. Lord M. Then let only such editions be brought into use, from which the exceptionable passages shall be entirely ex punged. Were the matter to come to a question, I would say, rather commit every vestige of Horace, Juvenal, Ana creon, and the rest of these shameful writers, to the flames, than leave it in the power of boys to pore over lines and sen tences, which cannot fail to contaminate their susceptible minds. Were you at the head of one of these institutions, would you sacrifice the virtue and innocence of the pupils confided to your care, for the sake of making them adepts in classical knowledge ? . Lady M. It certainly is no minor evil. Lord M. O, its magnitude is infinite. It ought to be a national concern; the government should commence a severe scrutiny, and ascertain whether the books which are used at those schools do not tend towards vitiating the minds of youth, more than any thing else that can be named ; and, if some higher authority do not institute a census, and expunge cer-"], [109, "91 tain passages for ever from classical authors, then the Society for the Suppression of Vice should do its duty. General. What could it do in such a case ? Lord M. Prosecute every printer who suffers his types to be polluted by imprinting words which modesty cannot bear to acknowledge as forming part of the language of human beings. General. Who can tell where this meddling society, (per haps not one of them acquainted with more than his English accidence,) might choose to stop in their curtailments. Lord M. Their sense of moral rectitude and common de cency is no less acute, by their being unlettered ; but, in the name of all that is dear and sacred to man, let those books be cleansed from their impurities, or never let the eyes of a school-boy gaze upon their polluting pages. General. But are there not, my Lord, advantages sufficient to counterbalance this tremendous catalogue of evils. Lord M. If there were, I would have withheld my censure, and have conceded to you, General, on the commencement of our conference. jGeneral. What, none, none at all! \u2014 You are severe, in' deed. Lord M. During the three years I passed within the walls of ******, I derived but little improvement in any branch"], [110, "92 of education, except in construing. But how could I learn, where the sine qud non is prosody and making Latin verses. During my whole time there, I cannot recollect many in stances of the head master making use of any part of the lesson of the day to inculcate a precept, to recommend a duty, or to convey moral instruction. If the sentences were properly construed, the derivations correctly stated, and a few mythological and chronological questions accurately an swered, then Dr. appeared to think that we had per formed our tasks, and he his, with all due exactness. Lady M. It seems, then, that polite literature and the elegant authors find no place where Pagan mythology erects her standard. Lord M. I had no encouragement to pursue the belles let tres, for neither my master nor my private tutor gave me credit for my information in such literature as had nothing to do with the classics and Latin verse; and the knowledge which I had acquired and brought with me from those plebeian schools, which my good friend so sarcastically under rates, I had no opportunity of farther pursuing or bringing into play. General. My Lord, you will, at length, I fear, redu.ce the standard of public acquirement to little more than a non entity. If neither polite literature nor morals were to be"], [111, "93 attained there, whence did Lord Mannerly derive the liberal stock for which he is so eminent. Lord. M. Not at ******, my friend. We had no Milton for a master to invite us to Holy Writ, to traverse the fields of Gospel promise, or to chant the sacred song of Sion. \u2014 No; this most requisite and most sacred branch of education is as little cultivated as if it were totally extraneous, for I es teem the formal and merely ceremonious respect which is paid to devotion more detrimental to its interests than if \"it \u25a0were totally omitted, and is thus little better than a solecism. Lady M. I think you mentioned Milton as a master. Did you mean literally ? Was Milton ever a school-master ? Lord M. 0 yes, certainly he was: \"Milton,\" says his biographer, \" was careful to instruct his scholars in religion.\" The diligence with which Milton laboured in his seminary, and the care with which he watched over the mental pro gress of his scholars, would be well worthy the imitation of the masters at ******. General. Well, my Lord, the result of this contest, it is pretty evident, will be, that you will leave our ancient seats of -learning without a particle of sheer merit, and no warrant for their proverbial celebrity whatever. Lord M. My dear friend, this is a subject of too serious importance for me to treat with levity, or to suffer prejudice,"], [112, "94 timidity, or false delicacy, to extort from me any unworthy concessions.

Your batteries have opened many dan gerous breaches, and you show no respect at all for those almost sacred citadels. Lord M. I will presently grant you a truce, General, but you must permit me to say, that had an impartial umpire stood by, he would have been able to gather from the matter in question, that my animadversions were candid, and would also have perceived, that would the heads of those public seminaries condescend to a few changes in the general plan, I should be decidedly in favour of them. General. No one certainly, who is in the least acquainted with your Lordship's erudition, will for a moment question your classical taste. Lord M. The degree of attainment I have warrants me to affirm, that there is something so captivating in elegant and classical knowledge, that I am sure it would be more readily and more cheerfully attained, if, in the first place, the means of communicating it were less harsh and compulsatory, and, secondly, if the subjects were divested of their poisonous particles, and confined absolutely to those classic authors, who blend moral chastity with elegance."], [113, "95 General. Well, my Lord, you have maintained a pretty good fire in this sharp contest. I will not say you have so involved me in sparks and smoke as to deprive me of the power of seeing how to take due aim, and to make your compliment reciprocal. Lord M. Before we hang up our battered armour, we must settle a little matter on the other side of the subject in dispute. Lady M. You mean, I suppose, the common academies. Lord M. Certainly. General. I hope, my Lord, you do not imagine you can find materials to defend them with the same zeal and facility as you opposed the higher schools. Lord M. My aim at least shall be fair and honest, and summary as fair. General. I stand prepared. Lord M. The charges I have urged against public schools are either fabricated or founded in fact. If the latter, (which I am warranted to affirm,) then the inference is, that, under their existing arrangements and economy, they are not only unsuitable receptacles for youth of the higher orders of the community, but are totally unfit for youth of any rank what ever.

[General mournfully shakes his head.] Lord M. Do not insult a falling foe, my love. However, I must still fairly and firmly push on the contest. General. O, I fear not the result ; yet, at least, our rigid censor will find no walls, no system, no masters, good enough \u2014 none competent to instruct our sons. Lord M. Pardon me, General ; I have found one for my own children, the system altogether of which, I humbly con ceive, obviates all I have been deprecating, and embraces all that is requisite to form the Christian, the scholar, and the gentleman. General. You are fortunate, my Lord. Lord M. Not exclusively so ; for, valuable as 1 have rea son to believe the school now in question is, I have sufficient reason to believe, that there are many of equal merit. It is true they bear no Alma Mater title ; are supported by no ancient prejudice, sanctioned by no national splendour. No; they have no title but that of gentleman, no support but their school labours, no marks of dignity but their Christian principles and scholastic abilities, no recommendation but what they do and what they produce, and no sanction but the discerning."], [115, "97 General. Halt there ! my lord, halt ! The mode of fight we have adopted is unequal; there is a sort of weapon which is altogether foreign to a soldier and to which I am altogether unaccustomed ; I mean that puzzling instrument of oratory, vulgarly called the tongue ; could I manage it with equal dex terity with you, my lord, I do still think that my cause might come off with as much triumphant eclat as your's. Lord M. If you think so, general, get a proxy, get a proxy ; I'll engage him in your stead; don't suffer a good cause to be lost for the want of a suitable weapon and competent skill. General. The first volunteer I meet with shall try the issue \u2014 ad interim I beg to be favoured with an outline of the positive advantages to be derived at those seminaries which are so fortunate as to engage the sanction of my noble friend. Lord M. Not my sanction alone, but the sanction and sup port of thousands, of some of the most enlightened characters in Europe, and indeed of every individual who has good sense enough to think for himself, courage enough to meet the blind dogmas of prejudice, and dignity enough to despise the vulgar pride, which little minds feel in having been educated at a public school. General. It is a pride, however, my lord, which there are few people but would be proud to have it in their power to display. K"], [116, "98 Lord M. That's a clean hit, General, but more brilliant than solid, for the fact of its being in itself a petty pride has lost none of its force by the point of your wit ; your retort, therefore, is like a painted feather in the shape of a sword, the thrust of which tickles indeed, but cannot wound. General. O, my lord, that weapon of yours ! \u2014 but, pray proceed. Lord M. The outline you require of the advantages to be found in many of the private academies may be sketched with out much difficulty. Besides the domestic comforts and local privileges, which, in general, are of a superior nature, the sys tem of education includes the classics morally conducted \u2014 The French and Italian Languages, Geography, Astronomy, Ma thematics, Arithmetic, Book-keeping, Commercial Transac tions, and though last not least, the English language and Elocution. General. The conductors of those establishments have a warm eulogist in your lordship. Lord M. Truth and gratitude prompt the eulogy as a debt due to unassuming and transcendent merit. Lady M. I cannot forbear saying, I think that education, morals, and manners, would be down to an alarming ebb, were it not for these parent sources. Lord As. Yes, much as these common schools are con-"], [117, "99 temned, and parsimoniously, (not to say more) as the labours and services of their worthy conductors are remunerated, facts themselves will prove that the sun of science, arts, and com merce \u2014 Religion, morals, and behaviour, from their humble sphere alone, beams forth its benign emanations and happy influences into every rank of society. General. I admire earnestness in any cause \u2014 it evinces principle at least, and decision of character. Lord M. I would avoid over heated and besotted enthusi asm as well as every degree of exaggeration. General. At least you cannot be suspected of lukewarmness in your cause. Lord M. My worthy Sir, lukewarmness is engendered by indecision ; indecision is the offspring of ignorance, and igno rance of sloth. I cannot conceive how indifference can exist where a thing is well considered and thoroughly digested. General. You have, my lord, given pretty decided evidences that you have thought this question deserving your considera tion. Lord M. A subject of such vitality commands it.
