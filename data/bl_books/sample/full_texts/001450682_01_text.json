The Author"], [13, "7 \\ rapid sketch ou the actual disastrous civil war; the way the Carlisle carry it, and the possible, moral and efec- live means to stop the progresses of the enemy. When in 1823 liberal principles were crushed in Spain by an impious faction, the constant ene mies of all public happyness, but who rather than to her own personal efforts and courage , owed her triumph to the armed cooperation of a hun dred thousand French bayonets which rushed into this unfortunate country, it was to be presumed that, when once masters ofthe direction of public affairs and disposers of so many vacant places, they would maintain in continual oppression and unmerciful persecution , all those who led by feelings of eternal justice and rational freedom, had shown intentions to see their country happy and content. Seven years attended with the most violent vexations, during which all kind of outrages that"], [14, "8 perversity can suggest were practised, could not but occasion the ruin of thousands and thousands of families. But July i83o appeared, and in the barricades of Paris we saw fighting for universal principles. Despotism received its mortal blow, and though new crimes still marked its dieying empire , yet liberal Spain .begun to breath more freely, seeing the term of her sufferings approach. Suddenly his Majesty was seriously taken ill. An enormous crime is committed. Thinking the king died, they proclamed his brother Don Carlos as the monarch of Spain ! Men who acted so rashly while his Majesty still lived, what could it be expected they would do after the king had really departed this life, being timely prepared with a force not less than 3oo,ooo well armed and equiped royalists, with a center of operations established in, and directed, from the Basque pro vinces and Navarra ? This , the recent facts will give solution to. King Ferdinand VII died on the evening of the 29th of September i833. The eagerness shown by the carlist party as soon as the melancoly news reached Bilboa (it was on the 2d of October next) gave us the signal of what would be the end of so much effervescence. Next day the horrid crime"], [15, "9 was perpetrated , and the idol of their passions Don Carlos Maria Isidro de Borbon proclamed as king of Spain and Lord of Biscay ! ! Bilboa , the sound part of this handsome town had to witness during 54 gloomy days, scenes of horror. Car nage, robbery, fraud and outrages of every des cription were committed on undefended, peaceful citizens! Such were the first steps that distin guished the mild and prosperous reign of Don Carlos! It not being my intention to give the recital of the important events occurred during these 32 months back, as facts are recently displayed, I will limit to describe the character of the follo wers of Don Carlos party, the criminal , coward , villainous and wicked manner how they carry on this fatal struggle , with the only means that in my opinion , I consider most adaptable to stop the progresses, of our enemies. Men who never ought to have ranked in so ciety, but who unluckily for her welfare , reached the helm through so many atrocities, such people must necessarely have been assisted by all. those classes having as much , or rather more interest in the overthrown of liberal principles. Priests and monks without moral feelings, of profligate"], [16, "10 habits, have therefore, associated themselves to their plans of iniquity. What has been indeed , and what is still their conduct and language in such terrible circums tances, good God!! a disgrace to the class they belong to! \u2014 suggestions from the confessional, treating opinions wholly unconnected with chris tian faith \u2014 turning the minds of thousands of families' rendered for ever miserable and unhappy \u2014 calling off the labourers of the fields to be their spies, to serve as telegraphs night and day over the summets of hills and mountains there watching all the movements and directions taker by our faithful troops \u2014 wretched and immoral beings , they have succeded in profiting of the ignorance and good will of so many fools to ex cite them to be the assassins of hundreds and hundreds slain , with unexemplary ferocity \u2014 women and men , old and young, and in many instances children, are the cruel assistants of so many barbarities, as they are told that by so doing, they serve the cause of God! ! Alas, is it possible that crimes of this magnitude should be committed in the name and for the support of religion !\u2014 But how little do the stupid leaders f>f so many wretches know, that the effects of"], [17, "11 their conduct are rather to bring into hatred and contempt that very religion they insult when as suming to defend ! \u2014 It is a fact also that the obscure followers of Don Carlos' cause in these revolted provinces are surrounded by men taking the tone of statesmen , who combine all the ba seness of hipocresy with the fixed purpose of continuing every profitable abuse , and of sus taining every lucrative oppression; and this as sertion is so far of being contradicted that, I ven ture to say, a peasant would give more credit to the grocest and most ridicule history of any of these ignorant sycophants, and will repulse the very words of the gospel , should they be pro nounced by cristino lips. The partizans of Don Carlos and leaders of this unhappy war are , therefore , a compound of igno rance, fanaticism, want, misery and distress, of all that is disgusting aud depraved, thieves, va grants, robbers and murderers, wicked and des parate individuals \u2014 But the supporters of queen Elizabeth's throne, are the lovers of true and le gal liberty, of rational and humane laws, the enlightened part of the nation, all the powerful classes, nobility, industry and commerce, the whole aided by- the simpathies of civilized world."], [18, "12 The only or principal means employed by the Carlists to annoy our faithful troops consist in their surprizes and ambuscades, which they exe cute with the greatest facility, being masters of the good dispositions of the inhabitants, the lo calities, the numerous woods and bushes, which are their natural intrenchments \u2014 they know no thing about fighting in open field, in a noble, ge nerous manner, as this only appertains to brave and gallant men. Among the Carlists such tack tics are unknown \u2014 indeed they find themselves perhaps very well off with such plan of campaign as they decimate our brave without mercy, and often they cannot defend themselves against their perfidy. How could we then put a stop to the progress of so great inhumanity? Alas! keen and hard as it may appear, there is nothing but retaliation. \u2014 All that philantropic sentiments could suggest, has been hitherto employed to win the hearts of these ungrateful creatures , but in vain : it is time they should know what we are capable of, and that justice is to be done them\u2014 they should know at once, that they can by no means prosper without being first submitted to our authority. The greatest importance should be attached to"], [19, "13 the free and expeditive maintenance ol the river of Bilboa and all the seaports on the coast, and we see with heart-feeling satisfaction that this part has been taken into consideration. Indeed Bilbos, the emporium of commerce in the North of Spain, could never be safe nor happy and pros perous , if the greatest and most exquisite exer tions were not directed to such an interesting point. It would be urgent to enforce, without the least regard or consideration whatsoever, the so often repeated orders issued by our civil and military authorities all over the country, or at least to all the cantons surrounding Bilboa and the principal towns, that under the shortest time possible they are to cut down or destroy all woods , thickets , bushes, hedges and walls at a distance of 800 feet on both sides of the high ways, roads, by-ways and principal defiles round their respeclive limits \u2014 that it being an uncontradicted fact that the Carlists are supplied from Bilbos and other chief towns of every necessaries, such as tobaco, salt, oil, brandy, linen, as silso ammunitions, it would be convenient to the good success of the queen's cause, that the exportation of every such articles should be prohibited while the present circunis-"], [20, "14 tances, except what may be directed for the use of people living within fortified places and where queen's orders are obeyed; though the long chain of the Pyrennees Mountains will allways be an insurmontable obstacle to our greatest endea vours, as long as we do not keep possession of our fronliere, in order to prevent their receiving any kind of stores from that quarter. All kind of subsistences the enemy may make use of, ought to be taken all over the country, and as the greatest respect is owed to the right of property, it should be kept within the fortified pla ces after due note is taken to account for the va lue. By these means and the most active persecu tion, we could soon get rid of the monsters that have devasted and dishonoured four of the hap piest provinces of Spain."], [21, "15 Geographical description of Biscat and Hie principal towns and villages\u2014 customs and manners of the inha- bitants.

E. on th^ side of Durango. The principal rivers are the Nerva or Ybaizabal wich waters Bilboa ; the Cadagua or Salcedon and the river of Durango, a particular description of wich I consider of great interest for military ope rations : Nerva, also called Nervion or Ybayzaral, com posed of two Basque names Ibai or Ibaya wich means river , and zabal or zabala , large \" large river\" \u2014 it takes its source with those two very large streams called Berriz and Abadiano : the former sprouts under the name of Cengoitia from the northen part of that chain of mountains call ed Sierra de Oiz , passes on the left of Berriz ,"], [23, "17 and in the small village of Olabe it is joined by an other stream descending by Zaldica down the mountains of Mallavia, Santa Marina and Lasuen \u2014 Lower below, it takes an other one from the same mountain of Oiz traversing the left of the parishes of San Miguel and San Juan de Garay until it joins the stream of Abadiano. This last admits all the little streams descending the moun tains oiCampanzar, Udala, and Besaide; passes, both , upon the right of Elorrio and the left of Echevarria, running by Arrazola, Axpe, Marzana, Apata Monasterio , and Urquiola, through the de file of Acharte, to the left of Abadiano. Thus both rivers run to the right of Durango and joining a little below the river of same name, as also an other stream called Duna and Yturrigaray, leaves Yurreta upon the right and runs in the direction of Berna (an iron foundry) taking near it the stream of Orobio; descends Muniqueta mountains, the declivity of Oiz on the left of Ochano , and leaving upon the night Zubiaur de Zornoza, where an other stream proceeds from the Bizcar qui mountains , comes to Lemona, forming around tour in a southerly direction and in the shape of a horse-shoe. \u2014 Close to Lemona it is again joined by the small river of Dima, leaves Bedia on the \u25a0t"], [24, "18 right and taking at Urgoitia the streams descend ing the mountains of Gumucio and Arechavalaga, passes through the right of Galdacano to admit lo wer down the river of Ceberio, passing Basauri 3 miles distant of Bilboa. Hence the Nerva, gathe ring all these small rivers and streams , leaving Echevarri to the right, crosses Abando, Deusto, or Olaveaga , Zorroza , the actual quaranteene ground and Luchana and here receives the Cadagua or Sal cedon river. \u2014 On the opposite bank is an other branch running to Asua underneath Puente de Luchana (Luchana bridge), and all at once drop into the occean at Portugalete, leaving the parish of Lejona on the right bank and Baracaldo on the left, so forming in front of the church of this last village, the peninsula called el Desierto, a delight ful seat lately occupied by a few monks of the Carmelitan order and now converted in a strong fortified place garrisonned by British and Spanish forces. The Nervion at last is also joined here by an other branch of sea called Galindo. Nervion or otherwise called Rio de Orduha (Or dufia river) takes its source at a short distance of this city, on the summet of the lofty mountains called Sierra or Peha de Orduha, from two springs named Ureta, in a seat the natives call Neivina or"], [25, "19 Nerviha : these streams falling down a height of near a mile, cross in a south to northly direction through the villages of Delica, Artomaha and Aloria. Passing near Tartanga, enters the county of Ayala by the villages of Saracho , Amurrio and Luyando, admiting the river Yzoria near the bridge of Marquijana. Pursues its course through the valley of Llodio up to the bridge of Areta (Puente de Areta) where it enters the territory of Biscay joined by the rivers of Orozco and Ce verio a little higher up after Miravalles. All them drop into the Nerva or Ybaizabal. It is abun dant in fish, among which the most delicate are the lojnas, trouts and eels. Cadagua or Salcedon : is that branch stretching as far as Luchana or old quaranteene ground for vessels bound to Bilboa. It takes its source in the mountains of Burgos , steering its course down Mena, Balmaseda, Zalla, Guenes, Sodupe, Cabex, La Quadra, and the parish of Alonsotegui. Mundaca-River : takes its source in the moun tains of Oiz, Gaztiburua and Bizcarqui, from the former of which spring out tvvo streams. One of these descends to the left of the parish of Men data : thither close to the foundry of Orozoaga , it joins that rurintng down Gaztiburua, and both"], [26, "> ( \u25a0*\u25a0) steering to the right of Arrazua , fall into the foun dry of Ajanguiz. \u2014 The other stream called Ma seta, leaves the village of Ybarruri on the right, and at a short distance to the left near the defile and farm named Oca (caserio de Oca), it is joined by that stream which through Gorocica, descends Bizcarqui, admiting a couple more from the same mountain a lower down at Ugarte de Muxica, and crosses through the middle of Ajanguiz and Guernica. \u2014 Leaves both the parish of Forua on the left hand , distance 3oo paces , and Cortezubi on the right, distance of i5o. Admits an other small river formed of various springs at Cantaza buru de Navarniz, running at last down the foun dry of Homa. \u2014 At a distance of nearly one mile of this last place , it is joined by an other stream bursting at Hereho, and steering down the parish of Gautiquiz de Arleaga. \u2014 From Cortezubi the Mundaca - river runs down Murueta, and leaving Busturia , at a 3/4 of a mile hence, receives an other small river formed of various springs from the mounts ofRigoitia and Arrieta, \u2014 descends to Pe dernales on the high road, so forming two little islands, the one named Isld de Pedernales, and the other Chacharramendi or Montenegro ( Black- Hill), whence proceeding at a short distance on"], [27, "21 the left , we find the sea-port of Mundaca ; the course of this river is about 35 miles. Lequeitio-RiveR : has its source north of Oiz mounlain. \u2014 At a distance of 4 miles it leaves Guerricaiz, and at 6oo paces further down, the parish of Munitivar right hand, crosses by Aules tia de Murelaga, and descending through several narrow passages down to Guizaburuaga which parish stands to the left, meets at Amoroto wilh a second stream, when at last both drop into the occean, and at a distance of 3oo paces the sea-port of Lequeitio is situated on the left bank. \u2014 Its course is from 1 8 to 20 miles. Oivdarroa-River : source in the eastern part of Oiz-mountain \u2014 formed of several streams flowing down Cenarruza , Bolivar and Guerena, until it joins the vecinity of Yruzubieta : hence flows down to Marquina, admitingon the left an other stream which descends the heights of Urco, Maax, Urcarregui and 'A rranoate : they all join at Eche varria across Jemein or Semein to the left, and Marquina on the right hand, so that this last town is situated on the confluence ofthe Ondarroa-river \u2014 steers its course near Berriatua, through the ve cinity of Renteria, down to the sea-port of Ondar roa on the left bank, a length of nearly 22 miles."], [28, "22 Durango-River s takes its source in the moun tains of Yguengana and Urquiola, whence descen ding ri\u00b0bt hand to Maharia , Yzurza and left, of Durango, joins lower down at Yurrela with the Nerva or Ybaizabal. There are besides , several torrents, falls, and smaller streams paying their tribut to the principal rivers, so as to form di verse roads or harbours namely those of Zomor rostro, Plencia, Ea, Elanchove, Baquio and Ar menza. The Coast of Biscay is generally very rough in winter season. The only port for vessels to take shelter at, being Bermeo , for besides the good ness of its entrance and anchoring ground , it has an other excellent road east of Cape Macki chaco, where ships of war may lay with all pos sible comfort and security. It would be a very difficult task for our cruizers to keep the sea du ring the stormy season , if Bermeo was to be left ungarrisonned. All the rivers and streams of Biscay move about 700 mills to grind wheat and Indian-corn ; there are besides upwards of 200 foundries; part of them being at present destroyed, owed to the di sasters of this calamitous civil war. In regular times they manufacture upwards of 100 thousand"], [29, "23 quiutales (called quintal macho of i52 liv.) of wrought iron, out of that abundant and good quality ore from Zomorrostro. The land produces wheat, Indian-corn, ches nuts, walnuts and all sorts of excellent fruits and grapes : of these last they make what the natives tall chacoli, which is a light and tolerably good taste wine , not sufficient for home consumption. Wherefore a great quantity of claret wine is in regular times imported from La Bioja (province of Castilla), say about 3oo thousand cantaras every year corresponding to about nooo hogsheads, but this large supply is levelled now by the cata lonian wine (vino carlon) which Bilboa merchants import from Barcelona and Tarragona. Agriculture in Biscay is brought to a very high pitch of perfection. The inhabitants, if left un molested by perfidous suggestions , are extremely laborious, as the ground all over the country is cultivated up to the very summets of mountains. The peasant women are very strong, robuste and of manly manners; they help their husbands and families in all hardships and labours, living in the most honest and comfortable manner. Bis- cay was , perhaps , one of the happiest provinces of Spain before this unfortunate revolution broke"], [30, "24 out, as ever since great change has occurred in their morals. Not long ago the biscayan peasantry was generous, hospitalary, honest, religious and a truly affectionate friend to all strangers and fellow countrymen. Now, the crafty navery of malicious priests and monks , followed by a set of ignorant , frenetick partizans of Don Carlos , have entirely changed the simplicity of their man ners by making them cruels, tricherous, assassins and robbers. They kill and plunder their fellow creatures with unexemplary coolness and perfidy. All that part of the land which is not cultivated is almost covered with thick woods of oaks, beech, elms, chusnuts, wallnut-trees and thick bushes, and that which is not employed as building ma terial, is reduced into charcoal, the only fuel made use of in Biscay for domestic and manufac turing purposes. These woods are also abundant in game of every description. The inhabitants of the sea-coast are usefully employed in the fishery line which is abundantly rich and of excellent quality, but what may be termed the head point of it and constitutes the welfare of thousands of families, is the fishing of tunny, tonger, merluch ( merluza ) and vesugo which is pickled and imported into Castilla by"], [31, "25 arneros (muleteers). The Sardinia is caught in abundance. There are besides other kind of fish, namely the luvinas and mubles, a sort of sea-trouts, turbot '(rodavallo) , mackrels (chicharros) , ois ters, lobsters, crabs, shrinks, and other sorts of testaceous. The chief sea-fishing port is Bermeo. Next are Mundaca, Ea, Elanchove, Lequeitio and Ondarroa. Commerce and navigation are very assidously carried on by the Biscayans. Bilboa is the gene ral entrepot for all the province, the center of internal activity and external enterprise. The number of merchant vessels belonging to Biscay and built in her own ports may be brought to upwards of 600 of all tunnages, and that of ships inwards and outwards Bilboa, about 1200, receiving and discharging in the course of the year not less than 25a thousand packages of different sizes. The principal instruments ofthe natives are the alboque a horn-pipe, the tambor and whistle or tamboril and silvo with whosp harmony sounds they dance their favourite aurrescu and azescu ( a sort of rigodon), the fandango and arin arin , a very quick and active dance. The government of Biscay is of the republi-"], [32, "26 can form. The Biscayans are still in possession of their privileges called \" Fueros de Vizcaya \" magna charta or bill of rights framed in i34a when they assembled at Guernica under the pre sidency of their natural lords, Don Juan Nunes and Dona Maria Nunes de Haro. On this very spot the country assembles every two years to de mand her governors an strict account concerning the manegement of public affairs. Here , and under the old tree of Guernica where now stands a beautiful free stone building serving as session hall, many a kings were forced to appear in or der to confirm and swear on ascending the throne, the maintenance ofthe fueros. Their privileges and immunities consist chiefly in the enjoyment of certain exemptions, namely \" that Biscayans would not pay other taxes but those that were granted to their primitive lords , such as a canon or quit rent imposed upon certain houses as a token of dominion; certain duties on wrought iron, a right of patronage and tithes on several churches ; that they will enjoy the right of nobility throughout the kingdom by only proving their being born in Biscay; that they will not be tried for any civil or criminal cause but by a chief justice of Biscay sitting at Valladolid as"], [33, "27 their special court. \u2014 If sentenced to death they have the right of not being hanged, but to be strangled ( agarrotados ) , though it appears this would answer to the same purpose. Laws orders or ordinances issued by the kings government cannot be enforced through out Biscay, if they do not obtain first of all, the con sent or execuatur of the country, which is termed , \" pase del Sehorio. \" The corregidor or Lordmair is the high autho rity of the province, being the delegate of the king. No other funcionaries are. admitted, but a post master and a judge of contraband (fuez de contrabandos) who watches for the exchequer. No farming for account of the king nor duties lo be paid on imports and exports of any kind of goods and merchandize; nevertheless, Biscay can not admit any such goods or merchandize as are, or may be prohibited by Royal tarif all through out Spain. The principal lines for custom houses on the frontieres are Vitoria, Orduna and Balmaseda. The Biscayans could never be recruited for the king's army, but voluntarily pay a certain sum of money as a kind of amends. However they con tribute to the sea service, being reckonned the best sailors in the navv."], [34, "28 The arms of Biscay or schield represent a tree with two wolves one upon the other.
