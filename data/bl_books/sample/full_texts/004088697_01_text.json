Whose strain is but the whining of some beggar Suing for alms beneath our window. Now The sequel of the tale, whose eloquence Beguiles the sun to loiter on his way. Fer. Thus passed the years without a cloud, save one. Childless, alas ! was still Sir Gilles de Barbe ; No son had he to carry on his line, Nor hope of one, his lady waxing old. One day, he called her to the eastern turret, From whence she staggered forth, breathless and pale. From that hour peaked and pined away. Some said She had inhaled a poisonous vapour there, Or seen some horrid sight ; but others said Her malady was but a broken heart, For words that he had spoken of divorce Betwixt them twain ! Suffice, the lady died. Within a month, Sir Gilles brought home a dame Buxom and fair, his newly wedded spouse ; And for a year the cloud seemed passed away. One year ! the lady brought a daughter forth. The knight swore long and loud, but still no help. A puling girl, when boys were so much wanted ! Another year, no promise of an heir \u2014 And now the cloud loomed darker than before. One eve, one summer eve, the sun not set, The lady to the eastern tower must wend, And ne'er came forth again. Upon the morn,"], [113, "ANNE BOLEYN. 101 Was at its base found dead. By some 'twas thought, Gazing from the high lattice at the sun, Dazzled she fell.

One month, and the knight brought a new spouse home, A meek and lovely damsel. In a year The gentle lady on her couch lay dead ; But no dark cloud above the castle rested ! A boy was worth the price she paid \u2014 her life ! So deemed the knight, as with high pomp and state The youthful lady to her rest was borne. The heir crowed on his nurse's knee \u2014 Sir Gilles Went forth to woo and win another bride. King. What, take a fourth ? a second Solomon But that we doubt his wisdom on this score. Three were enow for any man o' conscience. We interrupt the tale, a pleasant one. Marry, we yet may learn how Gilles de Barbe Contrived to help himself to a fifth mate.

But the young heir crowed on his nurse's knee, And men hoped that the cloud had passed for aye ! One night \u2014 'twas but three months since she was wed \u2014 The lady to the eastern tower was called. She came not \u2014 she had fled, in convent cell Had found sure refuge ; none knew why. Sir Gilles Was forced to sue the Church to grant divorce, Ere he brought home a young and beauteous lady In place of her, his disobedient spouse, Who would not quit the cloister for his bed, And so perchance her life preserve \u2014 some thought. The bride was blithesome, gay, and debonair ; Loved mirth and jollity, toyed with the pages. Askance Sir Gilles looked on the wanton game. The more she toyed, the darker grew the cloud ! 'Twas noon ; the knight was in the eastern tower, Whither the lady went. 'Twas thought he called her. The day was sultry, a storm i' the air. The crash of thunder shook the battlements, And with it blent, and yet above it rose, A fearful cry, as of lost soul in pain ! Without the threshold of the eastern tower, The lady on the floor was lifeless found ; Around her slender throat a strange blue mark, As if some fiendish hand had grasped her there. They buried her out of sanctuary, Like thing accurst \u2014 and the cloud passed away."], [115, "ANNE BOLEYN. 103 Brief was the wooing next, speedy the nuptials. In a short week Sir Gilles brought home a spouse, Widow of knight who fell in Palestine. She was a goodly lady and devout \u2014 Would bring, 'twas hoped, a blessing on the house. But day by day the cloud waxed dark and darker, Till it o'erspread the castle with its gloom. Some whispered 'twas a sign the time drew nigh The knight's soul would be forfeit to the bond ; Yet day by day went by, and each alike. 'Twas night, some minutes wanting to the hour When evil spirits have power o'er the earth, The hour, Sir Gilles with laugh and jest had bidden The lady meet him in the eastern tower. The cloud grew black as midnight without stars ! The lady to the gruesome tryst had gone, The holy book clutched in her hand, a charm Hung round her neck, relic of martyred saint. Who saw her pass noted her cheek was blanched, But not with fear, her step as firm as aye. Scarce had the eastern door closed on her, when A long loud peal of thunder rocked the castle. The tower from top to base was rent in twain. The body of the knight was never found ; Whether it lay beneath the ponderous ruins, Or, as some held, the demon claimed his own, Body and soul, at the appointed time, The knight failing to render in his toils"], [116, "104 ANNE BOLEYN. As many victims as the bond required, To loose Sir Gilles from the dread penalty \u2014 None knew, nor e'er have known. The lady spake not Of aught that she had seen or heard that night. The young heir from that moment peaked and pined ; He crowed no more upon his nurse's knee \u2014 And the dark cloud for ever passed away. Castle and lands the lady, with her hand And heart, bestowed upon a worthy knight. The pair lived happy ; dying, left then wealth Unto the Church \u2014 may Heaven assoil their souls ! So ends the story of Sir Gilles de Barbe ; The peasants call him still \" Barbe Bleu,\" in proof That he had won and lost so many wives. King. Gramercy for the tale \u2014 a pleasant one, Albe't the knight proved but a fool at last, To be outwitted thus. Why, God a' mercy !
