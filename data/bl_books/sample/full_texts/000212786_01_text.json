It is with great diffidence that the following volume, the first of a series upon the history of Massachusetts, is sub mitted to the public. So deeply is the author impressed with the importance of the subject upon which he has essayed to write, and so fully is he aware that to do it justice requires talents of the highest order, he has trembled, at times, for the consequences of his own temerity in engaging in such an undertaking. It is believed, however, that a work like the present is very much needed, and, if authentic in its details, will prove acceptable. Massachusetts has a history of which she may well be proud ; and whoever shall succeed in per fectly delineating that history, will render a valuable service to the State. If this sketch falls short of what some other might furnish, no one wiU more sincerely rejoice than the author in the appearance of a better ; but until such shall appear, it is hoped the present will not prove wholly unworthy of attention. The historian, in our day, can lay little claim to originality in his labors. It is not his province to create facts, but to take those already furnished him, drawn from the best sources, printed and manuscript, contemporary with the events of which they treat. If, in these respects, the present work"], [12, "VI INTRODUCTION. shall be found to contain such an abstract, faithful in its char acter and reliable in its details, the highest ambition of the anthor will be attained. The acknowledgements of the author are due those gentle met who have so kindly encouraged his labors, and to the societies which have granted him free access to their historical treasures. Particularly would he express his indebtedness to Messrs. Charles Deane, John Dean, Samuel G. Drake, Frederick Kidder, and J. Wingate Thornton, Esquires, for the loan of rare books and manuscripts relating to the early history of the State; to the Faculty of Harvard College, the Massachusetts, and New England Historical Societies, and the Boston Athe n\u00e6um, for access to their libraries and manuscripts ; and to the Honorable Ephraim M. Wright, Secretary of State, and the Clerks of his office, for access to the Archives of the Com monwealth. Such as the work is, with all its imperfections, it is sent forth in the hope that it may fill a place in the literature of our Commonwealth which has been for some time vacant ; and if the public derive that pleasure from its perusal which its preparation has afforded the author, he will feel amply repaid for his labor."], [13, "CONTENTS.

EARLY VOYAGES. DISCOVERY OP MASSACHUSETTS. The discovery of America is due to the courage of chap. Christopher Columbus. The existence of this country may have been known to the civilized world before his day, 1492 several of the Northern Nations of Europe claiming to have visited its shores so early as the eleventh century ; but by him conjecture was converted into certainty. Previ ously, profound ignorance prevailed concerning the Western Regions of the mighty Atlantic. Its vast expanse was viewed by many with superstitious dread. No mariner had penetrated deeply into its bosom. Cautiously skirting its coasts, and feeling their way along from point to point, few had ventured to lose sight of land, and the boldest and most daring regarded its obscurity as a gulf into which conjecture could not reach, and which it was madness in any one to attempt to fathom. The voyage of Columbus broke the charm of this spell, and the news of his discovery of a World in the West, struck Europe with an electric thrill. In every court the tidings were received with singular joy; the glowing de scriptions of the productions and wealth of that World caused fancy to revel in visions of affluence ; and an enthu-"], [20, "2 JOHN AND SEBASTIAN CABOT. CHAP. I. siasm, of which the counterpart has been seen in our own day, awakened by the discoveries in California and Aus tralia, pervaded all classes of society, and gave a fresh impulse to maritime adventure. The honor of initiating the discovery of America is by common consent conceded to Spain ; but this honor was not long destined to be exclusively enjoyed by that nation. England was at peace with all the world ; the civil wars of the rival houses of York and Lancaster had drawn to a close ; the application of Bartholomew Columbus had been favorably received by Henry VII. ; and a concurrence of circumstances favored the growth of the commerce of that nation, and the extension of her then but infant fame. The policy of Henry, though never signally liberal, was wise enough to encourage enterprise so far as others bore the expense ; and the marts of his Kingdom were thronged with adventurers from sunnier climes, familiar with the perils of the ocean, who were ready, even upon slight encouragement, to run great risks in the hope of great gains. Among these was John Cabot, with his sons Lewis, Sancius and Sebastian, \u2014 the last of whom was a native 'of England, being born in Bristol, in 1477. ' Both father and son are said to have been skilled in the nautical sciences;2 and the latter especially \u2014 the youthful Sebastian \u2014 whose genius is unquestionable, was filled with a daring enthusiasm and a restless desire to immortalize his name, by connecting it with some achievement akin to that which had thrown such luster upon the name of his contemporary, the Genoese voyager.3 Communicating to 1 Eden's Decades, sol. 255, ed. 1555, or 267, ed. 1577 ; Stow's Chron., 480, ed. 1631. from the fact of his having already made more than one voyage. 3 It is intimated bv 'AVhitelock, Memorials, 191, that there had been some communication between Cabot and the brother of Columbus, rela tive_ to the discoveries in the AVest Indies j but of this we find no proof. 2 Mr. Biddle, in his excellent Me moir of Cabot, 45, seems to doubt the skill of the father ; but he was evi dently familiar with maritime life,"], [21, "FIRST PATENT TO THE CABOTS. 3 the King the project of discovering a new way to India by chap. sailing to the Northwest, this project, as promising renown if successfully executed, and as competing with the illus trious discovery of Columbus, was immediately approved ; and a commission, characteristic of the thriftiness of the monarch, was issued1 to Cabot and his sons, authorizing Mar. 5 them to \" Sail to all parts, countries, and seas of the East, of the West, and of the North, under our ban ners and ensigns, with five ships of what burden or quan tity soever they be, and as many mariners or men as they will have with them in the said ships, upon their own proper costs and charges, to seek out, discover, and find whatsoever isles, countries, regions, or provinces of the heathen and infidels, whatsoever they be, and in what part of the world soever they be, which before this time have been unknown to all Christians.\" Power was likewise given to set up the Royal banner \" in every village, town,' castle, isle, or main land, by them newly found,\" and to subdue, occupy, and possess the same as vassals of the English Crown ; and it was further stipulated in this \" most ancient American state paper of England,\"8 that the patentees should be strictly bound to land at the port of Bristol on their return, and pay to the King one-fifth of the profit of their enterprise ; and the exclusive privilege of resort and traffic was secured to, and vested in them and their assigns, unconditionally and unlimitedly.3 In virtue of this commission, about a year after its grant1 May, 1 197. 1 Rvmer's F\u0153d., 12. 595; Hak- luyt, 3. 25, 26 ; Hazard, 1. 9. - Chalmers, Polit.

Besides, Sebastian himself was too young to have had the sole charge of such an expedition \u2014 being yet a minor \u2014 and the pres- ence of the father would seem to have been necessary, if for no other purpose than to sanction his author ity, and aid him with his counsel. 2 Smith, Gen.

The King's subjects, male and female, were permitted to accompany them as planters; to the patentees powers of government were granted ; and they were authorized to frame laws, and enforce their execution.1 One voyage at least seems to have been made under this grant, when the holders, dissatisfied with its provisions, surrendered it to the King ; and late in the ensuing year a second patent was issued to Ashehurste, Gunsolus, and Francis Fernandus, with Hugh Elliott, whose name does not appear in the first ; 2 but it is only from fragmentary and incidental allusions that we learn that any use was made of this patent;3 and for more than half a century. we have accounts of but few voyages on the part of the English for discovery in the New World,4 though the claims of the crown were still maintained.5 While Spain and England were thus augmenting their fame by brilliant achievements in the career of adventure, Portugal and France were provoked to follow. The Por tuguese, upon the first discovery of America, claimed the country by virtue of a bull from Eugene IV.;6 but by a second and later bull, from Alexander VI.,7 the right to the soil within certain limits was vested in Ferdinand and Isabella, and Portugal was prohibited from encroaching upon these bounds ; but dissatisfied with the edict of par tition, and breaking over the prohibition, private adven turers fitted out voyages, and Gaspar de Cortereal made discoveries at Newfoundland and Labrador.8 1 Biddle's Mem., 222, 306-14. 2 Rymer's F\u0153dera, 13. 37 ; Led iard, 1. 91 ; Biddle's Mem., 224. 8 See Biddle's Mem., 226, 230, notes. 6 Stat. at Large, 2 and 3 Ed.

France, however, paid little attention to Papal restric- chap. tions ; and that nation, prompt to seek her own aggran- dizement, and envious of the fame which her neighbors were enjoying, sent vessels and prosecuted discoveries over twenty degrees of latitude on the Atlantic seaboard, of which the most prominent were made by Verrazani, and 1524-5. Cartier.1 But fifty years after the discovery of America 1:31-19 by Columbus, the only Colonies permanently planted in the New World, were those in the West Indies, and in South America. The harsher climate of the North, coupled with the perils and dangers besetting a wilderness region clad with snow nearly one-half the year, proved effectual dis couragements to all who aspired to be founders of Colo nies. Avarice could reap no golden harvest from the ice bergs of the frigid zone. Commerce found no fragrant spices or luscious fruits to tempt the luxurious. No \" Groves, whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm, Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind, Hung amiable,\" adorned the coast. Only the hardier and more frugal gained a comfortable subsistence from the fisheries at the Banks.' Hence, while the sunny South was the theater of exciting events, the more frigid North remained, except in the fishing season, the same region of desolation and barbarism as when first visited by Cabot in 1497. During the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary, although some progress was made in navigation and commerce, little, comparatively, was done by the English to promote the discovery or settlement of America ; nor was it until after the accession of Elizabeth, \" The Restorer America was made in 1504.

France, too, who had never relinquished her attempts at settlement, continued her voyages, and upon the banks of the St. Lawrence, and in the region of Canada, had commenced a lucrative trade in furs ; and the sails of her vessels, engaged in the fisheries, whitened the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador. But after the lapse of another half-century, and one hundred years from the discovery of Cabot, all knowledge of the interior and its geography and resources was exceedingly limited; the best charts extant were but rude sketches of the coasts and harbors ; few had been bold enough to penetrate a land clothed with gloomy for ests, and filled with warlike savages ; and in all New Eng land, and the country to the North towards the pole, not a white family was settled, not a white child had been born.2 1 Sir Humphrey Gilbert was the author of the celebrated \" Discourse to prove a passage to the North- west\" to India, published in 1576; and in 1578, he received a patent for discovering and possessing lands in America; but his voyages ended disastrously, though discoveries were made and possession was taken in customary form, of lands afterwards covered bv the claims of the French.

By neither the English nor the French had permanent settlements been made in New England, or to the North. But the thirst for discovery was now fully enkindled ; the idea of colonization was more seriously entertained ; and England, having humbled Spain, van quished her Armada, and - established her supremacy as Mistress of the Seas, was eager still farther to demon strate her prowess by conquering the physical obstacles which had hitherto thwarted her success ; and drawing out of past failures lessons of wisdom for the guidance of the future, her plans were conceived more maturely, and executed more skilfully. France, likewise, had powerful motives to prompt the continuance of her efforts. Unwill ing to acknowledge her maritime inferiority to any other nation, and anxious to maintain her claims to the region over which her flag had so often floated, she was not to be outdone in voyages of discovery, or attempts at colonization. Hence the opening of the seventeenth century witnessed a succession of voyages on the part of both nations, attended with results of a more determinate character. The first English voyage resulted in the discovery of Massachusetts.1 One year wanting two days before Queen Elizabeth 16Q2. died,2 Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold, an experienced navi gator, who is said to have already crossed the Atlantic by the usual route of the Canaries and the West Indies, set out to sail to America by a Westerly course, which, as he conceived, would not only be more direct, but which would shorten the distance several hundred leagues.

It is worthy of notice that this ordinance neither incor porated nor conferred powers of government upon the mer chants of Holland, but vested in them simply a monopoly of trade ; the charter expired in 1618 ; the West India Company was not incorporated until 1621 \u2014 a year after the settlement of Plymouth;\u2014 the territory of New Nether land was not formally erected into a Province until 1623 ; nor was any permanent agricultural colony established within its limits until that year. It should also be noticed, that the territory embraced in the charter of 1614 was claimed by England, and was included in the patent to the Virginia Company ; the settlements of the Dutch were ever regarded as intrusions ; the controversies growing out of these claims disturbed for a long time the peace of the colonies ; nor were they permanently adjusted until after the reduction of New Netherland in 1664. A new era in the annals of New England begins with the voyages of Capt. John Smith. This remarkable man, a native of Willoughby, in Lincolnshire, although but thirty-five years of age, had acquired a world-wide reputation by his extraordinary adventures, begun in boyhood and continued for the space of \" near twice nine years.\" He had been a traveller in Europe, Asia, and Africa ; a soldier in Austria, battling with the Turks, and knighted for his services by Sigismund Bathori ; a slave at Constantinople, and indebted for his deliverance to \" the lady Tragabigzanda ; \" and, crossing to the New World to acquire new laurels, he had been a voyager to South Virginia, and President of the Colonial Council of that Plantation.1 Furnished, principally at the charge of four private gentlemen,2 with an outfit of two vessels, and a company 1 See his own account, in his Gen.

At the opening of the sixteenth century all Christian Europe, with but slight exceptions, was under the dominion of the Church of Rome. The Pope was the recognized head of that Church, and the fountain of all power, both temporal and spiritual. Kings reigned by his decree ; subjects bowed to bis behests. The keys of heaven and hell were in his hands. He was the vicegerent of Christ ; omnipotent in his sphere ; impeccable \u2014 infallible \u2014 a God upon earth. The Supremacy of the Pope few dared question. At tempts had been made to renounce his dominion, but the offenders were speedily reduced to submission, or atoned for their contumacy by the loss of their lives. It was more than high treason to deny his authority ; \u2014 it was heresy \u2014 blasphemy \u2014 an unpardonable sin. Hence his sway was undisputed.

The govern ment, indeed, had successfully resisted a few of her en croachments ; and individual minds had emancipated them selves from her thraldom, and denounced her as \"Baby lon,\" \" the Mother of Harlots.\" Yet when Luther kindled the fires of the Reformation, Henry VIII., the reigning monarch, was a dutiful and obedient child of the Church ; and no sooner did he hear of the apostasy of the Saxon monk, than he zealously denounced him as the chief of heretics, wrote in defense of the Seven Sacraments, and was rewarded for his championship with the flattering title of \" Defender of the Faith.\"1 In twenty years from the day on which Luther burned the bull of Leo before the gates of Wittenberg, his views had spread with electric speed ; the Augsburg Confession had been published ; Protestantism had assumed its dis tinctive position ; and in Saxony and most of the German principalities, in Sweden and Denmark, Hungary and Bohe mia, Poland and the Netherlands, France and Spain, and in Switzerland and England, the reformation had secretly or openly gained foothold, and the assumptions of Rome had been publicly spurned.2 Erasmus had leveled the shafts of his wit against the flagrant abuses of the Church, the corruptions of her priesthood, and the brutishness of the monastic orders; Calvin, Melancthon, Zuingle, Petri, Bucer \u0152colampadius, Peter Martyr, and Bullinger, early and warmly enlisted in the cause of reform ; and a host of determined and indomitable opponents of the supreme and unlimited authority of the Pope sprung into existence, hurl ing back the thunders fulminated from the Vatican, tram- gurnet, 1. 51, 282; 3. 26-7, 258; Echard, 640; Parl.

Hence he never departed widely from the creed of his childhood, and died in the Romish rather than in the Protestant communion. ' Yet something had been gained: \u2014 the power of the Pontiff was broken, and an impulse was given to the spirit of inquiry which the mon arch and the clergy strove in vain to resist. 2 But there was a Pope now in England as well as in Italy, and there was a Catholic Church in the British dominions as well as at Rome. Upon the accession of Edward VI., the son of Henry and the Lady Jane Seymour, who had been educated by Pro testants, and who was distinguished for his precocity, a disposition was evinced on the part of the wisest teachers of the new theology to advance farther than had been done in the preceding reign, and several changes were introduced favorable to the reformation. Yet, although the power was largely in the hands of the clergy, and more progress might have been easily made, it will hardly be doubted by those best acquainted with the history of the reformation at this period, that what was accomplished was not the result of a comprehensive view and calm investigation of all the doctrines and practices which had long been established, but the triumph rather of a specific policy, in discarding certain articles and forms which were condemned as well by the more moderate as by the more zealous opponents of Catholicism. It was during this reign that the public prayers were revised, translated into English, and a liturgy prepared. It was during this reign that the forty-two articles of 1 Burnet, Pref. vol. 1. 40 ; Hal- lam, 56 ; Bancroft, U.

The views of these champions spread into England ; and, as the hierarchy was incorporated with the civil policy of the kingdom, prelates and peers, bishops and barons, com posed the national legislature ; the subordinate ranks of ecclesiastics were continued ; the vestments of the clergy, and a large number of rites, sanctioned by custom and invested with the charms of immemorial antiquity, were retained ; and so essential were these considered to the maintenance of the power of the church, and its influence over the masses of the people, that, though admitted to be extrinsic appendages, it was insisted that it would be unwise hastily to abolish them, and impolitic to do so with out carefid deliberation. 1550. Hooper set the example of opposition to these rites by refusing to be consecrated in the episcopal vestments, nor could Cranmer and Ridley shake his purpose ; but after nine months contumacy and a \" seasonable imprisonment,\" he was induced so far to forego his scruples as to submit to be attired in them when ordained, and on public occa sions, but at other times he was permitted to follow his own judgment. In his reluctant compliance, however, he was not alone, though the Adiaphorists seem to have been the most numerous party. Yet though Bucer and Peter Martyr, then in England, expressed their dissatisfaction at seeing these habits retained, and Calvin and Bullinger wrote from Switzerland in the same strain, and the Helvetic divines generally applauded his consistency, upon the whole submission to the popular demand was advised, and thus for a season the dispute terminated, only to burst out anew and with increased violence a few years later.1 'Btanet, 2, 242-5, 264; 3. 299-307 ; Lingard, 7. 75-7 ; Neal 1 51- Grahame, 1. 127. \u00b0 ' ' 1- 0L'"], [57, "ACCESSION OF MARY. 39 CHAP II. 1553 to 15\u00a3S. It should be observed in passing, that this opposition to vestments was not, as has been asserted, a \" senseless scruple.\" It was because such vestments were the badges of Popery, uncountenanced by Scripture or the usage of the first centuries, that they were so strongly condemned. It was because they were regarded as inimical to spiritu ality, and as symbolizing with superstition \u2014 a mystical signification being affixed to them by the Romish Church \u2014 that they were abhorred and repudiated. And, while the English Church, animated with the desire of confirming her own power, conciliating her adversaries, and reconciling the people to the renunciation of the Pope, steered a middle course, tolerating and retaining many of the ancient habits and customs, those who were radically and irreconcilably hostile to every vestige of Catholicism, suspected that church \u2014 and not wholly without reason \u2014 of a Janus-faced policy ; \u2014 of temporizing, to seduce the adherents of the old religion, and to retain their hold upon the affections of the people ; \u2014 and hence the bitterness and the unstinted virulence of their censures of both churches as corrupt and anti-christian. But the bright star of Protestantism was suddenly eclipsed. Edward unfortunately expired at the early age of sixteen ; and Mary, the daughter of Henry and Catherine of Arra gon, who next ascended the throne, was educated a Catho lic, and possessed the bigotry and pride which she inher ited from her mother. The Reformation, therefore, had no charms for her. Not only did she subvert what had been done by her father and her half brother, re-establishing Catholicism with its pageantry and creed, but at the insti gation of Bonner, the fierce winds of persecution were let loose upon the favorers of Protestantism, the fires of Smith field were kindled, and eminent divines and hundreds of the laity perished at the stake, while hundreds more, fortu nate enough to escape, found at Frankfort, Geneva, Basil"], [58, "40 THE TROUBLES AT FRANKFORT. chap, and Zurich, an asylum from the violence which was raging H.

Surrounded by the influence of Calvin and his associates, those who were anxious for more purity of worship, and who recog nized, though imperfectly, the distinguishing principle of Protestantism, \u2014 the right of private judgment to every human soul, \u2014 labored to free themselves wholly from unscriptural ceremonies ; while the friends of the Anglican Church clung to its policy and supported its practices.3 The former, by permission, had settled at Frankfort ; and though the liturgy was used in their church, the responses were omitted ; the litany, the surplice, and other things were dispensed with ; and in the sacraments, those parts were rejected which were deemed superstitious and super fluous. * lose. Scarcely had this church been established a year, ere Dr. Cox, the former tutor of Edward VI., came to Frank fort, broke through the rules which had been adopted, and caused the litany to be used, and the responses to be made.

Fox, the martyrologist, with his associates, retired to Basil ; Whittingham, and Knox, the Scottish Reformer, settled at Geneva ; and Cox and his adherents remained at Frankfort. Time, the calmer of the passions of men, alone softened the asperities of this unhappy schism ; and before leaving the country to return to their native land, a reconciliation was prepared by concessions to the Puritans ; the churches passed letters of mutual love, promised to forget the dif ferences which had divided them, and agreed to unite in forwarding the reformation, and in procuring the abolish ment of offensive ceremonies : \u2014 pledges which were after wards partially redeemed.2 Upon the accession of Elizabeth the exiles returned, and those who had hid in the houses of their friends emerged from their concealment and ventured once more to appear. But the constitution of her Majesty's Council, and the arbi trary course early adopted by the Queen, and resolutely adhered to throughout her reign, soon satisfied the Puritans that there was very little hope of a farther reformation in religious affairs, and that the chief aim of her Majesty and her able advisers, was to build up more firmly her own power through the aid of the Church, whose interests were identified with the interests of the Crown. Instead, there fore, of resuming the work begun in her half-brother's reign, and carrying it on to its full fruition, as many of the clergy hoped she would do, she seemed well contented to leave things as he had left them, and to make no changes calcu- 1564.

As a natural consequence, persecution ensued. The Puritans were a sect ; this made them a faction. Opposition, so far from destroying, served only to radicate their principles and increase their power. In all classes of society their followers were found, though most numerous among the tradesmen in the towns, and the small proprietors and protestant gentry in the country ; and long before the close of their reign they began to return a majority of the House of Commons.4 The position of the parties to this contest \u2014 both of whom were probably equally sincere \u2014 was not eminently calculated to beget feeUngs of urbanity ; and coarse pleas- 1 Burnet, 2. 582 ; Whitelock, 226. 2 Prince, 231 ; Kallam, 109. 3 Stat. at Large, 13 Eliz., c. 12. 4 Robertson, Kb. 10. \u00a7 7, 8 ; Per sons, 242, 244, in Hallam, 116 ; Ma cauly, 1. 57."], [61, "43 THE BITTER SPIRIT OF CONTROVERSY. antry and bitter invective perpetually exasperated the vio- chap. lence of controversy. If Martin Mar Prelate \u2014 that \u2022^~^> vizored knight \u2014 is censured for his ribaldry, and for the profanity of his wit, the churchlings who replied to him were 1581' guilty of similar excesses. Theological gladiators have never been fastidious in their choice of epithets, and the ruder the jest or the more trenchant the sarcasm, the more pleasure such sallies have usually excited. On neither side was there a superabundance of courtesy or charity. It was an age of insane religious intolerance ; the vocabu lary of vituperation was utterly exhausted ; and the spirit of detraction exulted in affixing the stigma of disgrace upon those it denounced as heretics and apostates. Both sides were faulty, and, so far as an intemperate zeal is concerned, one is as amenable to censure as the other. If the Puritans, to wash their skirts, cast the odium of their sins upon their opponents of the English Church, they, in their turn, will cast the odium of their sins upon the old Church of Rome. The leaven of error was by no means purged out from the most advanced Protestant minds, nor even at the present day has it disappeared from all. We blame, therefore, the Puritans as well as the Anglican Church ; and the best atonement which can be made for such excesses, is for Christians of the present day to lay aside bitterness and malignant invective, and display, in their dealings with each other, and in their sectarian con troversies, more of that charity which is the chief of the graces, and the purest ornament of the character of the Christian. It must not be forgotten, however, in defining the position of Puritanism in the reign of Elizabeth, that the contro versies which convulsed the kingdom, and threatened almost to banish from the world the gentleness of the gospel, were not wholly confined to the tippet and the surpUce, the square cap and the liturgy. The Puritans were the har-"], [62, "44 AIMS OF THE PURITANS. chap, bingers of a political as well as of a moral revolution. v\u2014^-~> They aimed not only to restore Christianity to its primitive simplicity, purging vhe church of the corruptions of ages, 1581 ' but they aimed also to overthrow the idea, then the main pillar of the prerogatives of royalty, that we should obey men rather than God. Doubtless the ultimate tendency of their views was to republicanism rather than to monarchy. They would yield, in religion, nothing arbitrarily to the temporal sovereign. It was their motto that, in church matters, God's word was the guide. And though they can not be properly accused of open disloyalty, it must at the same time be acknowledged that their loyalty did not extend so far as to approbate the doctrine of passive obedience. And because the Church and the State were considered one and inseparable, and the unity of the former was deemed the safety of the latter, non-conformity was persecuted on the plea of necessity. This is the true secret of the oppo sition of the English Church to Puritanism and Independ ency. This Church, like that of Rome, had virtually assumed its own infallibility. It had driven down the stakes which were never more to be removed. It had interwoven the hierarchy with the whole temporal constitu tion of the realm. It had built up a system midway between Puritanism and the despotism of the Catholic Church. And the test of loyalty was undeviating conformity to the canons of the Church, and implicit obedience to the mandates of the Crown. The Church was yet in its infancy, surrounded by subtile foes. The State was trembling upon the verge of revolution. And the instinct of self-preservation prompted persecution of all who refused to put forth their hands to aid in supporting the ark of the Lord and the supremacy of the Crown.1 1 The language of the Queen, in her Speech at proroguing the Par- liament, in 1585, confirms the state- ment of the text.

England, \u2014 and that it was who will deny? \u2014 it was the^J^ natural result of such a policy to beget, on the part of the l^ Puritans, an attachment equally strong to the peculiarities of 1581, their rebgious system ; and upon their removal to America, the same principle of self-defense prompted the caution which was used in laying the foundations of their infant commonwealth, to guard it with jealous watchfulness against the aggressions and encroachments of Episcopacy, which they had learned to mistrust, and to build up a community exclusively of their own faith, as in England non-conformity was neither tolerated ,nor allowed. In England, Puritans could not enjoy the full privileges of Churchmen, because of their non-conformity. They were as sincere in their dis sent from that Church, as the Church was sincere in its own professions and practices. And the same reasoning which condemns the policy of the Puritans, condemns with equal severity the policy of the Anglican Church. We say not that either was right, absolutely and fully ; but we do say that, in our estimation, Puritanism, notwithstanding its errors and its early excesses, contained the seminal princi ples of true religious toleration ; and that, as experience enlightened the judgment of the professors of that faith, and as circumstances sanctioned the adoption of a more liberal policy, measures were promptly taken to initiate so desirable a reform, and the world is now reaping the fruits of Puritan iconoclasm and asceticism. But to return to the history of Puritanism, in England. For several years following the accession of Elizabeth, and especially while the attention of the Queen was particularly turned to the suppression of Popery, in which she was essentially aided by the Puritans, there was no extensive secession from the National Church. Yet before all fears of the Romish ascendancy were removed by the death of Queen Mary, the laws against non-conformity were zealously"], [64, "46 RISE OF SEPARATISM.

A new sect then made its appearance, at first called Brownists, from Robert Brown, its earliest advocate, who had been a preacher in the dio cese of Norwich, and who was descended from an ancient and respectable family in Rutlandshire. He was educated at Corpus Christi, Cambridge ; was a schoolmaster in South wark; then a lecturer at Islington ; and finally a preacher, inveighing against the ceremonies and discipline of the Establishment, and asserting the highly democratic and peculiarly unpalatable doctrine of the independency and complete jurisdiction of every church in its own affairs.5 From his subsequent apostasy, his followers very properly refused to be called by his name, and were known as Sepa- 1 Parl.

We must now pass to the history of the church of the Pilgrims. So early as 1592, a church was gathered at 1592. London, of which Francis Johnson was chosen pastor, and John Greenwood became the teacher ; but this church being broken up by the authorities, and its teacher imprisoned, the pastor, with a portion of his flock, escaped to Holland, and settled at Amsterdam, where for many years they con tinued to abide.2 A few years later another church was gathered, \" to the north of the Trent,\" in a rural district \" near the joining borders of Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire.\" This was the church of the Pilgrims, which, though first established at Gainsborough, was afterwards formed into two bodies, and the junior ordinarily met for public worship at the house of William Brewster, well known as the Elder of the church at Plymouth.

' The location of this church, and the history of its patron, have been involved for years in more or less obscurity ; but recently, through the successful researches of the Rev. Joseph Hunter, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and an Assistant Keeper of Her Majesty's Records, many new facts have been brought to light, whose im portance we cannot too highly appreciate. It may now be considered as satisfactorily proved, that the Church of the Pilgrims was first gathered at Gainsborough, and after wards at Scrooby, in that part of Nottingham known as \"the Hundred of Basset-Lawe,\" a mile and a half south of the market town of Bawtry, on the borders of York, and only a short distance from the verge of Lincolnshire.

Situated near the high road from York to London, it was, on that account, a convenient resting place for the Archbishops of York in their journeys to the metropolis ; and lying near the celebrated Hatfield Chace, it was, on that account, a favorite resort for the enjoyment of field-sports. It was the frequent residence of Ap.

That at Scrooby, though it seems to have been second in point of time, is first in importance in the history of the Pilgrims ; for here the choice and noble spirits who planted New England learned the lessons of truth and liberty. Here, under the faithful ministrations of their excellent teachers, they were nourished and strengthened to that vigorous fortitude and manly endurance, which braved all dangers and conquered all obstacles. Here, breathing the air of spiritual freedom, they acquired that courage which enabled them to sacrifice home and its charms, and expatriate themselves to distant lands, rather than abandon their principles, or yield to what they regarded as an unrighteous encroachment upon their ecclesiastical privileges.3 It will be noticed that Mr. Robinson appears upon the ieo3. stage at about the date of the accession of James I., the greatest pedant that ever sat upon the English throne.

But alas! the \"Scotch mist\" was soon dis pelled ! James was a dissembler. It was the failing of his life that his word was no bond.

They could not in peace return to England. It was dangerous to remain in the land of their exile. Whither then should they go ? Where should an asylum for their children be reared?

It was granted the dangers were great, but not invincible ; for although there were many of them Ukely, yet they were not certain. Some of the things they feared might never befal them ; others, by providence, care, and the use of good means, might in a great measure be prevented ; and all of them, through the help of God, by fortitude and patience might either be borne or overcome.\" 2 Whither should they turn their steps ?

Was it criminal to seek a pleasant abode ? But as an offset to its advantages, its \" grievous diseases \" and \" noisome impediments \" were vividly portrayed ; and it was urged that, should they settle there and prosper, the \"jealous Spaniard\" might displace and expel them, as he had already the French from their settlements in Florida ; and this the sooner, as there would be none to protect them, and their own strength was inadequate to cope with so powerful an adversary.

Accordingly other agents were sent,2 to procure a patent, Fst>., and to negotiate with such merchants as had expressed a s willingness to aid them with funds.3 On reaching England, these agents found a division existing in the Virginia Com pany, growing out of difficulties between Sir Thomas Smith and Sir Edwin Sandys ; and disagreeable intelligence had been received from Virginia of disturbances in the colony which had there been established.

The nature of these proposals has never transpired, nor is the original patent \u2014 the first which the Pilgrims received \u2014 known to be in existence.

Upon the reception of the patent and the accompanying proposals, as every enterprise of the Pilgrims began from God, a day of fasting and prayer was appointed to seek divine guidance ; and Mr. Robinson, whose services were ever appropriate, discoursed to his flock from the words in l.Sam. Samuel: \"And David's men said unto him, See, we be 23 : 3, 4. afrai,j nere jn Judah : how much more if we come to Kei- lah, against the host of the Philistines.\" Next followed a discussion \" as to how many and who should go first.\" All were ready and anxious to embark; but funds were wanting to defray their expenses.

If the Lord \" frowned \" upon their proceedings, the first emigrants were to re turn ; but if He prospered and favored them, they were to \"remember and help over the ancient and poor.\" As the emigrants proved the minority, it was agreed that the pastor should remain in Holland, and that Mr. Brew ster, the Elder, should accompany those who were to 1 Mr. Cushman.

Each party was to be an absolute Church in itself ; and as any went or came, they were to be admitted to fel lowship without further testimonies. Thus the Church at Plymouth was the first in New England established upon the basis of Independent Congregationalism.1 Early the next spring Mr. Weston visited Leyden to conclude the arrangements for \" shipping and money ;\" and Messrs. Carver and Cushman returned with him to England to \" receive the money and provide for the voyage.\" The latter was to tarry in London, and the former was to pro ceed to Southampton; Mr. Christopher Martin, of Billerrica, in Essex, was to join them; and from the \"county of Essex came several others, as also from London and other places.\"2 Pending these negotiations, the property of those who were to embark was sold, and the proceeds were added to the common fund, with which vessels, provisions, and other necessaries were to be obtained. But Mr. Weston already half repented his engagements, and more inter ested in trade than in religion, he informed his associates that \"sundry honorable lords and worthy gentlemen\" were treating for a patent for New England, distinct from the Virginia patent, and advised them to alter their plans, and ally with the new Company. At the same time their agents sent word that u some of those who should have gone, fell off, and would not go ; other merchants and friends that professed to adventure their money, withdrew, and pre tended many excuses ; some disliking they went not to Guiana ; others would do nothing unless they went to Vir ginia ; and many who were most relied on, refused to adventure if they went thither.\" Such discouragements would have disheartened men of a 'less sanguine tempera ment, and for a time the Pilgrims were \" driven to great 2 Bradford, in Prince, 66. 1 Bradford, in Prince, 66 ; Cot ton's Way, 16 ; Winslow, in Chron.

The Pilgrims were poor, and their funds were limited. They had no alternative, therefore, but to asso ciate with others ; and, as often happens in such cases, wealth took advantage of their impoverished condition. By their instructions, the terms on which their agents were to engage with the adventurers were definitely fixed, and no alteration was to be made without consultation. But time was precious ; the business was urgent ; it had already been delayed so long that many were impatient ; and to satisfy the Merchants, who drove their bargain sharply and shrewdly, some changes were made, and by ten tight articles the emigrants were bound to them for the term of seven years.2 At the end of this period, by the original compact, the houses and improved lands were to belong wholly to the planters ; and each colonist, having a family to support, was to be allowed two days in each week to labor for their benefit. The last is a liberty enjoyed by \"even a Vallachian serf, or a Spanish slave;\"3 and the refusal of the Merchants to grant so reasonable a request caused great complaint ; but Mr. Cushman answered per emptorily that, unless they had consented to the change, \" the whole design would have fallen to the ground ; and necessity having no law, they were constrained to be silent.\"4 As it was, it threatened a seven years' check to the pecuniary prosperity of the colony ; but as it did not interfere with their civil or religious rights, it was sub mitted to with the less reluctance, though never acceptable. \u2022^K'lLo w a -,<>\u00ab - Hubbard, 48-9 ; Hazard, 1. 87- 91; Plym.

Knowing that but a portion of the church were preparing to embark for America, and that all would be glad to emigrate in a body, overtures were made to Mr. Robinson as pastor, that if he and his flock, and their friends in England, would embark under the auspices of the Lords States General, themselves should be transported to America free of expense, and cattle should be furnished for their subsistence on their arrival. These are the \" liberal offers \" alluded to in general terms by early Pil grim writers, and which are uniformly represented as hav ing originated with the Dutch,1 though recently it has been suggested, and even asserted, that the overtures came from the Pilgrims themselves. 2 But there is an inherent improb ability in this last representation, arising from the fact that much time had been spent in procuring a patent in England, and in negotiating with the Adventurers for the requisite funds ; and an avowed object with the Pilgrims in leaving Holland was to preserve their nationality. They had no motive, therefore, to originate such a proposition, 1 See Bradford, in Chron. Pil. 42, and Winslow, in ibid., 385. But the clearest reference we have seen to these offers, is in the Petition of Plymouth, presented to James H., May 30, 1688, in Vol. 7, Mather, MSS.: \" We have humbly suppli- cated,\" says this Document, \"for the confirmation of these lands unto us, whose predecessors out of that in nate loyalty engraven on their hearts to their natural prince, could not bear to think of settling themselves and their posterity under a foreign state, notwithstanding any offers made to them,\" &c. 2 Broadhead's New York, 123-6. 7"], [92, "PETITION OF THE DUTCH MERCHANTS REJECTED. 74 CHAP.

This concession was enough for the merchants to act upon. \" They saw at once that so many families going in a body to New Netherland could hardly fail to form a successful colony.\" But the political part of the question they were unable to decide. \" They were ready to expend their capital in carrying the emigrants to New Netherland, and in supplying them with necessaries ; but they had no authority to promise that the Dutch government would afford to the colonists special protection after their arrival there.\" \" They therefore determined to apply directly to the general government at the Hague.\" The Prince of Orange was then in the zenith of his power ; and to him, as stadtholder, the merchants repaired with a memorial, professedly in the name of the \" English preacher at Leyden,\" praying that \" the aforesaid preacher and 400 families may be taken under the protection of the United Provinces, and that two ships of war may be sent to secure, provisionally, the said lands to this government, since such lands may be of great importance whenever the West India Company shall be organized.\" The stadtholder was too wary a politician to approbate immediately so sweeping a proposal, and referred it to the States General. For two months it was before this body, where it was several times discussed ; and finally, after repeated deliberations, it was resolved \" peremptorily to reject the prayer of the memorialists.\" Nor can we doubt the wisdom of the policy which prompted this decision. It was well known in Holland that the English claimed the territory of New Netherland. The Dutch had hitherto been tolerated in settling there, because they had not openly interfered with the trade of the English. But should they"], [93, "THE SPEEDWELL AND TnE MAYFLOWER. 75 CHAP III. 1CS0. now send over a body of English emigrants, under the tri colored flag, designed to found a colony for the benefit of the Batavian republic, the prudent foresaw that a collision would be inevitable, and might result disastrously to the interests of their nation. Mr. Robinson and his associates, though exiles, were Englishmen, and would be held as such in Holland or in America. Hence, had the Pilgrims emigrated under the auspices of the Dutch, and had James I., demanded of them the allegiance of subjects, they would have been compelled to submit, or the nation which backed them would have been forced into a war. There was wis dom, therefore, in the policy which rejected the memorial of the merchants. In consequence of the disaffection of Mr. Weston, there were complaints of his delay in providing the necessary shipping; but at last the \"Speedwell,\" of sixty tons \u2014 miserable misnomer \u2014 was purchased in Holland for the use of the emigrants ; and the Mayflower, of one hundred and eighty tons \u2014 whose name is immortal \u2014 was chartered in England, and was fitting for their reception.1 The cost of the outfit, including a trading stock of \u00a31,700, was but \u00a32,400: \u2014 about $12,000 of the currency of the United States ! It marks the poverty of the Pilgrims that their own funds were inadequate to meet such a disbursement ; and it marks the narrowness of the Adventurers that they doled the sum so grudgingly, and exacted such securities for their personal indemnity. There were some generous hearts among the members of this company, \u2014 true and tried friends of the exiles in their troubles ; but many of them were illiberal and selfish, and had very little sympathy with the principles of their partners.2 1 Capt.

The particulars of this voyage \u2014 more memorable by far than the famed expedition of the Argonauts, and paralleled, if at all, only by the voyage of Columbus \u2014 are few and scanty. Though fair winds wafted the bark onward for a season, contrary winds and fierce storms were soon encoun tered, by which she was \" shrewdly shaken,\" and her \" upper works made very leaky.\" One of the main beams of the midships was also \" bowed and cracked,\" but a passenger having brought with him \" a large iron screw,\" the beam was replaced, and carefully fastened, and the vessel continued on. During this storm, John Howland, \" a stout young man,\" was, by a \" heel of the ship thrown into the sea, but catching by the halliards, which hung overboard, he kept his hold, and was saved.\" \" A pro fane and proud young seaman,\" also, \" stout and able of body, who had despised the poor-people in their sickness, telling them he hoped to help cast half of them overboard before they came to their journey's end, and to make merry with what they had, was smitten with a grievous disease, of which he died in a desperate manner, and was himself the first thrown overboard, to the astonishment of all his fellows.\" One other death occurred, \u2014 that of William Button, a servant to Dr. Fuller ; and there was one birth, in the family of Stephen Hopkins, of a son, christened \" Oceanus,\" who died shortly after the landing. The ship being leaky, and the passengers closely stowed, their clothes were constantly wet. This added much to the discomfort of the voyage, and laid the foundation for a portion of the mortality which prevailed the first winter. l \" Land ho ! \" This welcome cry was not heard until two months had elapsed, and the sandy cliffs of Cape Cod were the first points which greeted the eyes of the exiles.

Facts prove that the Dutch were contem plating the permanent settlement of New Netherland, and the early Pilgrim writers assert that overtures were made to the Leyden church by the merchants of Holland to join them in that movement; and when the petition to the States General presented by those merchants was finally rejected, and the Mayflower commenced her voyage intending to proceed to the Hudson, is it improbable that steps may have been taken to frustrate their intention, and that arrangements may even have been made with the captain of that vessel, by Dutch agents in England, to alter her course, and land the emigrants farther to the North ? We are aware that one2 to whose judgment we have usually deferred has said, that, had the intelligence been early it would have been more certain. But every student of history knows that late intelligence is often more reliable and authentic than early ; and if it be asked, from what source did Morton obtain his information? \u2014 we can only suggest that, up to 1664, New Netherland remained under the dominion of the Dutch, and the history of that colony was in a great measure secret to the English. But several of the prominent settlers of Plymouth had ere this removed to Manhattan, \u2014 as Isaac Allerton, and Thomas Willet, \u2014 and after the reduction of the country and its subjection to England, from these persons the late and certain intel ligence may have been received, or from access to docu ments which were before kept private.3 1 Moulton, and Brodhead, in their Hist's. of N.

It is described by Maj. Grahame, as \" one vj^ of the finest harbors for ships of war on the whole Atlantic ie2st coast. The width and freedom from obstructions of every kind, at its entrance, and the extent of sea-room upon the land side, make it accessible to vessels of the largest class in almost all winds.

But these advantages were wanting ; and though our fathers considered it an \" extraordinary blessing of God \" in di recting their course for these parts, which they were at first inclined to consider \"one of the most pleasant, most healthful, and most fruitful parts of the world,\" longer acquaintance and better information abundantly satisfied them of the insuperable obstacles to agricultural productive ness and commercial importance.2 The Pilgrims were now ready to pass to the shore. But before taking this step, as the spot where they lay was without the bounds of their patent, and as signs of insub ordination had appeared among their servants, an associa tion was deemed necessary, and an agreement to \" combine in one body and to submit to such government and gov ernors as should by common cousent\" be selected and chosen.

But the truth chap. seems to be that, although the form of government adopted by the emigrants is republican in its character, and remark- 162\u00b0 ably liberal, at the same time its founders acknowledged suitable allegiance-to England, and regarded themselves as connected with the land of their nativity by political and social ties, both endearing and enduring. Left to them selves in a wilderness land, apart from all foreign aid, and thrown upon their own resources, with none to help or advise, they adopted that course which commended itself to their calm judgment as the simplest and best ; and if, under such circumstances, their compact was democratic, it seems chiefly to intimate that self-government is naturally attractive to the mind, and is spontaneously resorted to in emergencies like the present. It is as unwise to flatter our ancestors by ascribing to them motives different from those which themselves professed, as it is unjust to prefer charges against them to which they are not obnoxious. They were honest, sincere, and God-fearing men ; humble in their circumstances, and guided by their own judgment; but endowed with no singular prophetic vision, and claiming no preternatural political sagacity. They could penetrate the future no farther than to confide in the justice of God and the power of truth. The latter they knew must ulti mately prevail, for the former was pledged to secure its triumph. x The first care of the exiles, having established their pro visional government, was to provide for their shelter.

Although history is silent respecting the early events of the lives of a majority of the Pilgrims, we have reason to think that but few of this band had been regularly trained to the profession of arms, and Standish is the only one who is certainly known to have served as a soldier. Thrown, therefore, upon the inhospitable shores of New England, and surrounded by savages whose enmity they feared, the experience of the first winter impressed them with the necessity of speedy military organization ; and before spring dawned, a meeting was held to consult upon measures of defense, and Standish was chosen Captain, and entrusted with \"authority of command in] affairs.\" In the midst of their deliberations, two savages appeared upon a neighbor ing eminence, \u2014 the advance guard of a greater body, the clamor of whose voices was heard by those sent to parley with them. x Four days after the ordnance of the colony was mounted ; and March being ushered in with warm winds from the south, and the pleasant singing of birds in the woods, about the middle of that month a second military council was convened, and a second aboriginal interruption occurred. A single savage, armed with his bow, marched boldly to their rendezvous, and in broken English bade them, \" Wel come ! \" This was Samoset, the \" Sagamore of Moratig- 1 Chron.

But soon this last link connecting them with the Old World was broken ; for early in April, this frail bark, the precious memorial of their wanderings and suf- ferings, weighed her anchor, hoisted her sails, and, skirting the harbor towards the Gurnet, while the lone Pilgrims crowded the strand watching the lessening speck, gradu- ally vanished from sight, leaving them amidst the solitude of nature, shorn of half their strength, to encounter the mysterious perils of the future ! To the honor of these men let it ever be remembered, that not one of their number fainted for weakness, or turned back faltering to the home of his childhood ; but, with a loftiness of purpose which was ever theirs, and consecrating themselves anew to the work in which they had engaged, all resolutely remained, determined to abide the direction of God, and calmly to follow the leadings of His hand until summoned from earth to their heavenly home. The very day following the departure of the Mayflower one more, and the head of the band, received his summons ! Suddenly seized while at work in the field, and deprived of his senses in a few short hours, the spirit of Carver returned to the Giver, and the Pilgrims were bereft of their Gov ernor and friend !

Upon this, Tokamahamon was sent to ascertain the truth of the report, and Tisquan tum and Hobomok following him, and being discovered by Corbitant, he beset the house in which they were lodged, and took Tisquantum prisoner ; but Hobomok broke from his grasp, and escaped to Plymouth.

But just as he was about to be delivered into their hands/ a boat was espied, which crossed before the town, and disappeared behind a headland ; and the Governor availing himself of this incident to justify delay, the mes sengers, \" mad with rage,\" departed \" in great heat,\" and Tisquantum escaped.1 It was towards the last of May when these events May, occurred, and the provisions of the colonists were entirely 16 % spent. Hence the appearance of the boat excited fears and hopes : \u2014 fears lest it should prove to belong to an ene my ; hopes that it would prove to belong to their friends. On reaching the shore, it was found to be a shallop from the Sparrow, a fishing vessel then at Damarin's Cove, near Mon hegan, sent out by Messrs. Weston and Beauchamp, and bringing six or seven passengers, but no provisions. By a letter from Mr. Weston, they learned that he had wholly Jan. 17. withdrawn from the Adventurers, and was purposing to establish a plantation of his own.2 As it was of the utmost importance that supplies should be obtained, on the return of this shallop Mr. Edward Winslow was sent to visit the vessels at Monhegan for aid ; and by several of the captains he was gratuitously furnished with a sufficiency of bread to allow each person four ounces i Bradford, in Prince, 118 ; Wins low, in Chron.

Scarcely, how ever, had the new colonists arrived at \" Old Spain,\"2 ere the Indians complained of them for stealing, and other abuses. The Charity, at her departure in October, left them provisions enough for the winter had they been prop erly husbanded ; but wastefulness and extravagance soon reduced them to want. They were compelled, therefore, to resort to Plymouth for aid, and proposed forming a part nership to trade for corn, \u2014 offering the use of the Swan in procuring supplies. This proposition, as the Pilgrims themselves were in want, was cheerfully accepted ; and the chief places to which their attention was turned were \" to the southward of Cape Cod.\" Before anything decisive was accomplished, however, their agent, Mr. Richard Green, the brother-in-law of Wes ton, died at Plymouth ; and Standish, who had twice started on a voyage to the South, was both times driven back by the wind, and was now sick of a violent fever. Thus the prosecution of the voyage devolved on Gov Bradford ; and taking with him Tisquantum, he went to Monamoycke, now Chatham, where eight hogsheads of corn and beans were obtained.

Governor Bradford, questioning the messenger, and finding the Indians were scantily supplied as well as Weston's men, wrote Sanders to dissuade him from violence, and exhorted him to live upon ground nuts and clams as the people of Plymouth were doing.

To one cause of this distress we have already alluded \u2014 the extravagance of Weston's men, who wasted their sub stance in riotous living. Another was the clause in their compact, by which all that was raised in the colony was placed in a common stock. This wretched arrangement \u2014 entered into from necessity and not from choice \u2014 was never satisfactory. The indolent, sure of a living, would labor only when compelled to ; the willing were discour aged by the severity of their toils. To remedy this evil, a change of policy was introduced, and to each person was alloted, for one year, one acre of ground for his personal benefit, only requiring that a portion of the crop should be deposited at harvest in the common treasury, for the main tenance of government and the support of the gospel. In April planting commenced, and the weather held favorable until the last of May. Pleased with the now order of things, cheerfulness and industry prevailed. There was a stimulus to exertion in the hope of individual benefit. Even the women and children labored in the field ; more corn than ever was planted ; and more life and zeal were displayed.1 But, though favorable weather forwarded their plants in the earliest of the season, from the third week in May a drought set in, and for six weeks no rain fell, so that the ground was completely parched, and the plants, \" both blade and stalk, hung the head and changed the color,\" and were \"judged utterly dead.\" To add to their distress, they learned of the repulse of a supply, sent by Mr. Pierce, who had now obtained his surreptitious patent, and it was feared that the vessel was wrecked on the coast. At once, therefore, God seemed to have forsaken them. The most resolute faltered, and general despondency pre vailed.

This was John Ljford, an Episcopal minister, who seems to have been sent hither by a portion of the Adven turers adverse to the views of the colonists, to whose coming Mr. Cushman and Mr. Winslow were forced to consent to prevent a rupture ; and as his advent was the beginning of the series of difficulties which resulted in the dissolution of the connection with the Adventurers, it may be well to glance for a moment at the condition of the colony at this period. i62i.

In the spring of 1624. 1624, the population had increased to one hundred and eighty souls, and the number of dwelling houses was thirty two.

The consequences of the controversy with Lyford were much more important than might be inferred from its cause. The dissatisfaction among the Adventurers, which had for some time been increasing, rose to its height ; a rupture occurred ; and two-thirds of the members withdrew at once, leaving the colony to shift for itself. A portion of the blame of this rupture is charged, even by the friends of Apr. 7 the Pilgrims, to their mismanagement. From a letter, writ- 1624, ten some months before the breach occurred, we learn that there were complaints of \" slothfulness \" and \" weakness,\" and a lack of sufficient diligence to increase the stock of the company. But this lack of diligence was the natural result of the terms of the original compact ; and it was to remedy this evil that, in 1623, one acre was granted to each person to cultivate for his own benefit ; and in 1624 this grant was made permanent. By this new arrangement, fresh zeal was infused into the desponding, and, had it gone on uninterruptedly until the end of seven years, the com mon stock would doubtless have been largely increased, without detriment to the Merchants, and greatly to the benefit and encouragement of their associates. 1 Hubbard, 93, 102, 106,107. * Hubbard, 102.

Probably there was blame on both sides. The connection of the merchants with the colonists was more mercenary than moral ; and the connection of the colonists with the merchants was involuntary and profitless. It was one of those cases in which misunderstandings are sure to arise, and from which recriminations inevitably result.1 The breach having taken place, there was no disposition on either side to attempt a reconciliation.

Eight of the principal men hired the trade of the colony for the period of six years, for which, with the vessels and merchandize on hand, they assumed debts to the amount of \u00a32400, and agreed to furnish \u00a350 worth of goods annually to the planters, and to sell corn for 6s. per bushel; and, at the end of this time, the trade was to be restored free of charge. In accordance with this arrangement, Mr. Allerton was once more sent to England, taking with him such furs as had been collected ; and he was empowered to bargain with the Adventurers, deliver the bonds, and receive their con veyance. He was also instructed to obtain, if possible, a \" patent for the Kennebec,\" and to interest friends to join with the eight undertakers, for the discharge of the debts of the colony, and the removal of their Leyden friends. Succeeding in his mission, he returned the following spring, having paid the first installment of \u00a3200, and enlisted Messrs. Shirley, Beauchamp, Andrews, and Hatherly, in the trading adventure. He brought, likewise, a patent for the Kennebec, but so ill-bounded that it was necessary the next year to have it enlarged ; and an attempt was then made to obtain a new patent for Plymouth itself. Thus the partnership with the Adventurers was dissolved, and the colonists had made safe provisions for the payment of their debts, the prosecution of trade, and the reception of their brethren still resident in Holland. Cheerfulness, animation and industry prevailed ; and strong hopes were entertained that the clouds, which had so long lowered upon their pros pects, were forever chased away, and that the period of their suffering and struggles was over.1 Cotemporary with these events, a memorable episode in 1 Bradford's Letter Book, in 1 M.

Wollaston, not far from the residence of the late President Adams. Among his companions was Thomas Morton, a lawyer, who seems to have first visited America in 1622, and who may have been of Weston's company, which settled at Wessagusset.2 No mention is made of a patent to Wollaston, nor is it stated from what place his colony came. It was probably a private enterprise, undertaken upon his own responsi bility, or he may have been connected with Gorges, the proprietary of those parts. After being seated here a year, Wollaston himself left for Virginia, taking with him part of his servants, and wrote Mr. Rasdall, his partner, to come with another part, appointing Mr. Filcher or Fitcher as his agent, until he or Rasdall should return. No sooner was Rasdall gone, than Morton, the chief actor in the ensuing drama, and, at the best, a man of ques tionable principles, plied the servants with liquor, and excited them to depose Filcher, and set up for themselves. Falling in with his plans, the former agent was driven out, and compelled to seek his bread among his neighbors, and a scene of licentiousness and debauchery commenced, such as these western wilds had never before witnessed. The name of the place was changed to Merry Mount ; a May Pole was erected, \"with revels and merriment after the old English custom ; \" and a course of dissipation ensued until the stock of the colony was consumed.

It may be that the Puritans were too \"rigid\" in condemning such practices, and it may be that their \" morality \" was sterner than that of their co temporaries ; but it will reflect little honor upon the Church of England to sanction the proceedings of Morton, or to ascribe to jealousy and hatred of Episcopacy, that which is too evidently chargeable to the hero of Merry Mount. In addition to his other malpractices, he began to inveigle servants away, and to sell arms to the natives ; and, having taught the latter the use of these weapons, he employed them to hunt for him, and purchased their peltry. With their usual facility and aptness to learn, the savages in a short time became expert marksmen, and passionately devoted themselves to hunting and the chase. Their bows and arrows were cast aside as worthless ; and they would buy muskets at any price, if it was possible to obtain them. They were taught, likewise, the use of the pistol and rapier, and the art of moulding balls and repairing defective arms> so that they became formidable antagonists ; and, by their superior cunning, agility in racing, and quickness of sight, they were more than a match for a majority of the colonists. Stimulated by success, \u2014 having sold upwards of twenty guns, and one hundred pounds of powder and ball, \u2014 Mor ton sent to England for fresh supplies. But the English, in their scattered settlements, meeting these savages in the woods thus armed, and fearing the evils that might ensue, were alarmed ; and, aware that the mischief would spread unless speedily checked, and might become incurable, a meeting of the chief planters was held, and they agreed to solicit the people of Plymouth to join with them to stop Morton's career. The reply of the Pilgrims was, that \" they had no authority to do any thing ; but seeing it tended to the utter ruin of the whole country, they would join with them against so public a mischief.\" An embassy was accordingly sent to admonish Morton of"], [162, "144 THE SETTLEMENT AT MOUNT WALLASTON BROKEN UP. chap, the offense he was giving, and to warn him to desist, as his conduct was contrary to the laws of England ; but the mes- senger was received with oaths and curses. \"Proclama- tions,\" said Morton, \"are no laws, and enforce no penalties. The King is dead, and his displeasure dies with him. I shall trade with the natives despite of your protests.\" Upon this, Capt. Standish was sent with eight or nine men to arrest him ; and on arriving at Merry Mount, Morton armed his companions, heated them with liquor, and putting powder and balls on the table, barred the door. Standish summoned him to surrender ; but he scoffed at, and defied him. At length, fearing his house might be forced, he came out, with a great show of courage, as if to an assault ; but Standish, fixing that eye upon him before which many a savage had quailed, stepped resolutely up, seized his musket, and dispersing the more turbulent, with Morton as his pris oner he returned to Plymouth.

It was the desire of the people to procure a Charter, if possible, and it is said their views were so far seconded, that the Lord Keeper was instructed to give orders to the Lord So licitor to draw one up in their favor ; but, through the jeal ousy of some of the Massachusetts Colonists,1 and the opposition of others,2 their object was defeated, and no Charter was obtained.

The progress of settlement was far less rapid here than in the Massachusettss Colony. The Pil grims were poor, and belonged to the laboring classes. Not blessed with wealth, they were unable to extend their operations with flattering facility. But their poverty was no crime, however great its disadvantages. It fostered a spirit of humility, and was, at the same time, favorable to the development of industry and prudence. Quietly and noiselessly they pursued their way, asserting their rights with dignity and calmness, yet fearlessly and firmly main taining and defending them.

The author is the fortunate possessor of one of these rari ties. We shall have occasion hereafter to speak farther of the legislation of the colony, in the continuance of our sketch. As we look back upon the career of the Pilgrims, traced in their annals, we are impressed with the magnitude and the importance of their mission. With no outward pomp, with no gorgeous ceremonies, with no popular applause, with no acclamation of multitudes, was the foundation of their humble settlement laid. Favored by no royal protec tion did they prosecute their enterprise. For all that was achieved the honor is theirs. And of them may it be truly said, that they laid the corner stone of our beloved Commonwealth, and were instruments, in the hand of God, of initiating that work, which has scattered broad cast over the surface of our country the seeds of great princi ples, destined, by their development, to confer upon us still greater blessings, and to multiply the fruits which have already abounded, from their unwearied and unmurmuring labors and struggles."], [167, "CHAP. VI. 624. to 1626. CHAPTER VI. THE MASSACHUSETTS COLONY. In the preceding pages, we have sketched the history of the Plymouth, the primitive Colony of our State, from its inception to its peaceful and permanent establishment ; and we are now prepared to turn our attention to a similar view of the Massachusetts Colony, which, though subse quent in its origin, and several years the junior, soon took the lead upon the theater of action, and, owing to the superior advantages attending its advent, was more rapid in its growth, and more prosperous in its enterprises. In one respect, both colonies sprung from the same source, religious persecution having ushered them into life, and a desire to rear an asylum, a refuge for the oppressed, dis senting from the views and policy of the Anglican Church, being the groundwork or foundation upon which they were built. But, though both were the offspring of religious persecution, in other respects there was a striking and an inherent distinction in the views, the rank, the talents and the resources of the two ; a distinction which, as it marked their beginnings, so it influenced, moulded, and determined their destiny. The Pilgrims were Separatists, having openly withdrawn from the communion of the National Church. Few of them had been reared in opulence or luxury. Few had enjoyed extensive opportunities for literary culture. Early inured to hardship and toil, unaccustomed to the ease and the refine ments of wealth, simple in their habits, and moderate in 13*"], [168, "150 CHARACTER OF THE COLONISTS. ohap. their desires, they were eminently fitted as pioneers to New England, preparing the wilderness for the possession and !^4- occupancy of succeeding generations. Men of unwavering ,m faith and of exemplary morals, with a profound reverence for God and his word, they were \"the servants of pos terity,\" \" instruments to break the ice for others,\" and, though cast into the shade by the success of the second Colony, they are entitled to the honor which springs from true worth, and their magnanimous spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion, will ever endear their memories to all capable of appreciating their virtues and comprehending their ex cellencies. The Massachusetts Colonists were Puritans, connected with the National Church, though not fully conforming to its service and ritual. Their ministers were men of stand ing and influence. Receiving a finished education at the leading universities, their talents, which were conspicuous, were acceptably exercised until their zeal for reform and opposition to ceremonies induced the censure of the bishops and expulsion from their parishes. Of the laity, many were well versed in public affairs, possessed fortunes, accu mulated or inherited, and lived in the enjoyment of the external comforts which wealth can command. A few moved in the higher circles of society, bore titles of no bility, and were genuine representatives of the conventional dignity of the mother country. Able of themselves abund antly to furnish both followers and funds, and exempted from the necessity of depending upon others, they could easily equip, not one bark but a fleet, and send, not one hundred but many hundreds, to inhabit the territory selected for their residence. More fortunate than the Pilgrims, who acted worthily their part, their fortune and rank enabled them to obtain what was wanting to the former a charter from the crown, with privileges greater than could be derived from a subordinate patent. Hence the"], [169, "CHARLES THE FIRST AND ARCHBISHOP LAUD 151 history of the second Colony, though not destitute of inci- chap. dents of hardship and suffering, is of a stamp very different vj^ from that of the first. Its enterprises were prosecuted with vigor and success. Its superior advantages gave it an immediate ascendancy. It stretched out its arms, scat tered abroad its means, became the patron of the arts and the sciences, founded seminaries of learning, reared flour ishing villages, engaged in commerce, established manufac tures, and, taking the lead both in secular and in spiritual affairs, attained to such power and strength that its name became identified with the name of the State. The colony at Plymouth was commenced during the reign of James I., who ascended the throne in 1603, and died in 1603. 1625. On the accession of Charles I., who inherited his 1020. father's political theories, the government of the National Church, not yet divested of its persecuting spirit, was entrusted to men of arbitrary principles and papistical pro clivities. Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, too lenient to subserve the rigorous views of the Court, was suspended from his office, and the notorious Laud,1 zealous to promote uniformity in religion, became the head of the Church, and the instrument to forward the purposes of the King. From this period, the Monarch surrendered himself to the per versities of his humor, and, with StrafTord and Laud as his temporal and spiritual advisers, both in the civil and in the ecclesiastical administration of the realm, a system of insolent invasion of every right most valued by freemen and revered by Protestants was deliberately pursued, with a stubborn ness and cruelty which finally exhausted the patience of the people. Three-fourths of the clergy were at this time Calvinists ; but Charles and Laud having sympathy with the Arminians, an edict was issued prohibiting the promul gation of the former tenets under the severest penalties ; 1 See Burnet's character of Laud, Hist Own Times, 1. 49."], [170, "152 THE STAR CHAMBER AND THE HIGH COMMISSION. chap, the Star Chamber and the High Commission, fit engines vj^w-of despotism, were brought into requisition, and distin- guished themselves by a course of such wantonness and barbarity, that the latter, especially, was stigmatized as the Protestant Inquisition. Fines, imprisonment, banishment and the pillory, were the most lenient punishments inflicted by its judges. Its victims were not infrequently condemned to excoriation by the lash of the executioner, the incision of their nostrils, and the excision of their ears, and in this mutilated condition were brutally exhibited as monuments of the \" justice of the sovereign, and the piety of the pre lates.\" 1 1627-8. In civil affairs, the two favorite projects of Charles were, the recovery of the Palatinates from the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria, and the establishment of arbitrary power in his own dominion. To effect the latter, many members of Parliament, then the citadel of Protestantism, were imprisoned for opposing his measures ; and the resolution of the King to trample upon the national legislature, and his open approval of the infamous sentiment advanced by one of the clergy, that his royal command in the impo sition of loans and taxes obliged the conscience of the sub ject under pain of eternal damnation, alarmed the fears of the thoughtful, and induced apprehensions of the increase of the persecuting spirit which raged in the Church. Nat urally, the question arose, whither should they flee ? France, externally embroiled with Austria and England, was inter nally convulsed by a contest of intense acrimony between Protestants and Catholics. A puissant Protestant league of Holland, Sweden, Saxony and Denmark, waged inter necine war with the Emperor of Germany.

The whole political horizon chap. was shrouded in gloom, and the prospect of a refuge on any part of the continent was dark and forbidding.1 The tendency of these commotions in Church and State, was to call attention more earnestly to the colonization of America ; and especially the Puritans, the objects of mo narchical vengeance and prelatical rage, turned their eyes hitherwards with eager desire to secure a retreat from the storms of violence which threatened to engulph them in irretrievable ruin. The success of the Plymouth Colony had decided the question of the possibility of supporting a settlement upon these shores ; and the hope that here would be none to disturb them in the exercise of their rights, was a powerful inducement to encounter the perils of the ocean, and the miseries of the land, for the tranquil and peaceable enjoyment of these rights.2 We have elsewhere referred to the establishment of a colony at Cape Anne, in 1624, by the Dorchester Company, 1624. of which Roger Conant was appointed Governor.

To the emigrants and their posterity were conceded all the rights of natural born subjects, on taking the Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance, which was empowered to be administered rather than expressly enjoined 1 \u2014 and the right of enacting laws not contrary to the laws of the realm. Full and absolute power was likewise given \" to correct, punish, pardon, govern, and rule \" the inhabitants of the colony, and to repel invaders as occasion required.

It is admitted that the Charter says not a word upon the subject of religious toler ation. It contains no clause directly alluding to this matter. And it is also, perhaps, true, that the King had no power to granJ such liberty, as it would have been contrary to the statutes of the Anglican Church.2 But, while the charter does not, nor was it necessary that it should, expressly concede the right of freedom in religious worship, which is the inalienable birthright of man, independent of prince or any other potentate, it does not, except by implication, withhold or deny that right. Charles knew perfectly well that the grantees were non-conformists. He knew that they did not seek this charter to transport the National Church unaltered to America.3 He knew that they expected some license in religious affairs. Now it is a maxim of English law, and the dictate of common sense and universal equity, that in all cases, where the import of a compact is doubtful, the bias of presumptive construction ought to incline against the pretensions of the party whose office it was to speak, and who had the power to clear every ambi- > Hist U.

In legisla ting for other colonies, the formal establishment of the Church of England, to prevent innovations, was expressly enjoined ; 2 and why was not a similar clause inserted in this charter, unless the king was willing to connive at the conduct of the Puritans ? As this course was not taken, the inference seems just, that it was at least with his consent that the prohibition was omitted, and this pretermission, although it may not have legalized dissent, gave the emi grants virtually all the license they required.

Mr. Bright accompanied these settlers, and officiated as their minister ; but remained not over a year, nor was any church formed until some time afterwards.3 Thus at two prominent places, Salem and Charles town, were settlements commenced by the Massachusetts Company. Mr. Higginson, on his arrival at Salem, found but \" about half a score houses built,\" and one more stately edifice, occupied by Mr. Endicott, though other build ings were doubtless erected by fall, and shelters of some kind were provided for all the emigrants.4 At Charles town were but a few \" wigwams,\" the \" palisaded house \" of Walford, and the \" Great House \" built by Mr. Graves. 1 Dudley's Letter, 12, ed. 1696, or the same as in Force, and Chron.

We are aware that the conduct of Mr. Endicott has been severely censured by many writers,1 and some of the Company in England seem to have trembled for its consequences, and in their letters advised more moderation and prudence.2 If, however, it is admitted that, upon the broad grounds of Christian toleration, the course of the Puritans can hardly be justified, is it not equally true that the same verdict must be passed upon the course of the English Church ? It should be borne in mind, that the Puri tans only copied the example set them at home ; and, as they came here to enjoy their own faith, in their own way, they regarded the intrusion of the Common Prayer worship among them, as in England their presence was regarded by the National Church, and adopted the same course to rid themselves of its encroachments, as had been adopted there 1 As Chalmers, Robertson, Coit, Haliburton, &c.

In the summer of 1629, the Massachusetts Company and the Massachusetts Colony, were virtually distinct bodies, the latter subordinate to the former, and dependent upon it for support. The Charter of Charles I., gave vitality to the Company. That Charter was at first resident in Eng land, and there its powers were principally exercised. But it seems to have been the intention of part at least of the grantees, and the most influential part, in procuring this instrument, to make it the basis of a civil government in America. Gentlemen of distinguished family and ample estate were connected with the Company. Some of these had already sent servants to New England. And, intending to hazard their persons as well as to employ their fortunes in erecting a Commonwealth on these shores, they were aware of the disadvantages inseparable from the residence of the chief legislative authority in England, and were reluctant to embark unless these difficulties were obviated, and the custody of the Charter was committed to the emi grants. It was their desire to identify the Company and the Colony ; to make both one ; that the latter might no longer look abroad for its privileges, but act within itself, and exercise, on the place, all the powers claimed by the former. As yet, the views of these gentlemen seem not to have been openly avowed ; but as Mr. Cradock, the Governor of the Company, was doubtless acquainted with the same, and may have himself had thoughts of removing hither, at one"], [193, "TRANSFER OF THE CHARTER. 175 CHAP.

By leaving the charter in England, \" it would necessarily have followed that all the measures of the corporation would have been taken with final reference to the interests of the undertakers at home. It would have been a company to be enriched, and not a people to be governed.\" 2 Hence the proposition was calculated to awaken great interest; and the surprise which it caused led to an earnest debate. But, as a matter which could not be hastily decided, its immediate decision was not pressed, and the members were desired \" privately to consider it,\" and to \" present their reasons in writing pro et contra, at the next court,\" that the Company might \" come to a final resolution ; \" and in the meantime they were requested to \" carry the business secretly, that the same might not be divulged.\" 3 The transaction here brought to our notice is unique, and unparalleled in the annals of English colonization ; and, as it is one upon which serious charges, affecting the integrity of the Company, have ever since been based, it merits a full and careful discussion.

One thing, chap. however, is certain : \u2014 the step was not taken without legal s^v^ advice, and probably the best which could then be obtain- 1629' ed ; 1 so that, if it be admitted, judging from the stand point of English jurisprudence, that the proceeding was irregular, the Company is exonerated from having clandes tinely and fraudently accomplished it ; and in an age of unconstiutional acts, when the example was set by royalty itself, the sons justitia, subjects may well be excused for seeking their own interests, especially when their conduct was quite as reasonable as that of their rulers. But there are other and broader points from which this measure may be viewed. It is generally admitted that the principles which governed both James and Charles in granting patents and charters, were vague and obscure. The corporations created by the crown were strictly royal corporations ; the lands which were conveyed belonged to the royal domain ; and the prerogatives of the king were vast and undefined.2 Both father and son, therefore, stood upon their prerogative ; nor was it until \" the civil wars and the Restoration had decided the nature of the English constitution, had marked out and fixed the various powers of each component part of it, that the nation gave to her provinces permanent systems, analagous to her own.\"3 Hence, under the old regime, the grantees, as they were authorized by the wording of their charter, interpreted that instrument \" most favorably on the behalf and for the benefit and behoof of the Governor and Company and their successsors.\" They contended that their chartsr cre ated a corporation of, but not necessarily within England ; that the powers of government which it granted were full 'Chron.

Their correctness, in some respects, we are aware has been questioned ; in others it has been admitted.2 And though these views were probably more democratic than were acceptable to Charles T., they were sanctioned by the Long Parliament,3 nor did the colonists hesitate to avow them to Charles II.4 And such being their views, they did not look upon their corporation solely as a trading corporation, \" under the narrow construction of the com mon law, but as affording the means of founding a broad political government, subject to the crown of England, but yet enjoying many exclusive privileges.\" 5 \" Other plantations,\" say they, \" have been undertaken at the charge of others in England, and the planters have their 1 Winthrop's Journal, 2. 341, 345, 347, 348, 351, 352, 354, 360-3, 365-6 ; Hutch.

Independent of these considerations, however, still broader grounds may be taken in justification of the course of the Company. It seems virtually to have been the maxim of those days, that \" All a man sailed by or saw was his own ; \" and this maxim was held, among all the nations of Europe, \" a just and sufficient foundation, on which to rest their respective claims to the American continent. It received a universal acquiescence, if not a ready approbation, and became the basis of European polity, and regulated the exercise of the rights of sovereignty and settlement in all the Cis-Atlantic Plantations.\" 3 And yet, not only did the colonists deny the correctness of this maxim,3 but the Eng lish nation itself, in the reign of Elizabeth, questioned its validity;4 in the House of Commons, in 1621, a similar position was taken ; 5 and eminent writers upon Interna- 1 Winthrop, 2. 366-7. 2 Story on the Const., 1. 4 ; Thur- loe's State Papers, 5, 81, in Hazard, 1. 602; Chalmers, Ann., 676-7; Wheaton's R., 8. 574-88, and El.

Again: \u2014 It was held as an axiom then, that \" an Eng lishman could not divest himself of the character of subject ; he could not say, I will be no longer an Englishman; whithersoever he emigrated, he still owed allegiance to the crown and obedience to the laws of his country ; because the weakness of his childhood had been protected by them.\"2 But, referring again to writers upon International Law, Vattel and others affirm that, \" If the sovereign, or the greater part of the nation, will allow but one religion ni the state, those who believe and profess another religion have a right to withdraw, and to take with them their fami lies and effects. For, they cannot be supposed to have subjected themselves to the authority of men, in affairs of conscience.\"3 In the light of this position, it may be contended that the Puritans, as debarred liberty of conscience by the hierarchy and the crown, had an undoubted right to withdraw from the realm ; and, as the territory of Massachusetts was then a \" vacuum domicilium,\" occupied by the aborigines alone, they had a right to settle here, especially with the consent of the natives.

However questionable the claim based upon the fortuitous circum stance of prior discovery, as it accorded with the conven tional usage of the age, that claim was allowed, and there fore could not be slighted without bringing the emigrants into open collision with the crown, which might have resulted in their expulsion from the country by an armed force, as the Dutch were afterwards compelled to relinquish their settlement at New Netherlands. Hence a charter was deemed necessary to foreclose these evils ; and hence one reason why that instrument was deemed of such value, \u2014 because, under its sanction, their right to the soil, was legalized and established.1 That charter, however, could not deprive the colonists of their natural rights, for these were inalienably theirs. In the estimation of the grantees, it chiefly constituted a connecting link between them and their native land, guaranteeing the encouragement and protection of their Prince ; and, as it further conferred full powers of government, it was accepted and cherished through weal and through woe. With the Puritans, the idea extensively prevailed, not only among the masses, but among some of the nobility and principal commoners of the realm, that those who left England, and emigrated to America, were at full liberty to establish such government as they chose ; and, like the primitive Greek colonies, \" to form a new state, as fully, to all intents and purposes, as if they had been in a state of nature, and were making their first entrance into civil ized society.\"2 They looked upon their plantations abroad, as scions from the parent stock, transplanted to a new 1 Chalmers, Ann., 677 ; Belknap's N.

The leaders in the Puritan ranks were expe rienced statesmen, and skilful diplomatists. The discipline of persecution had developed their minds, and strengthened their purposes. With the theology and politics of their day they were familiarly conversant ; and, uniting prudence with firmness, zeal with energy, and resolution with cour age, they were looking forward to a higher freedom, both civil and religious, than had been hitherto enjoyed in the land of their birth. This freedom, in its broadest form, may have been imperfectly shadowed forth to their minds ; but it was sufficiently understood to render its possession an object of earnest desire and ardent pursuit. It was in accordance with these views that the present step was taken. The Charter was their own. It had been obtained at great cost, and was designed for their benefit. There was no provision in the instrument itself prohibiting its removal to America. Its integrity was not destroyed thereby. And the most that can be said of the movement, viewing it aside from its political consequences, is, that it transferred the place of holding the meetings of the Com pany from London to Boston.1 Before the meeting at which this transfer was agreed to, some \" General Considerations for the Plantation in New England,\" were drawn up and circulated ;2 and at Cambridge, an agreement was subscribed by twelve gen tlemen, to the effect that if, \" before the last of September, the government and patent of the plantation were legally transferred, to remain with the emigrants, they, with such of their families as were to go with them, would, by the Bancroft, U.

New England.\" 1 J^ The transfer of the charter, therefore, was, in one sense, a 1629' foregone conclusion. It must either be consented to by the Company, or many of its most influential members would withdraw from it their patronage. Accordingly, when theAug.28; court convened, the question of transfer, by the erection of hands, was emphatically, and with but little opposition, decided in the affirmative.2 Yet, to answer the ends of the law, and to obviate the technical objection that the charter created a corporation within the realm, a portion of the members of the Company, who purposed to remain in Eng land, were organized into a board of trade ; and with them was left the management of all affairs relating to the inte rests of the Company, so far as it was connected with the source from which the charter was derived. 3 As this transfer was to blend into one the Company and the Colony, which had before been distinct ; and as Mr. Cradock had been hitherto Governor of the Company, and Mr. Endicott the Governor or Superintendent of the Colony, and the charter contemplated but one person as the head of the Company, and its chief executive magistrate, a new choice of officers was judged to be necessary, and a meeting was held for that purpose. 4 Oet. 20.

The government of the Massachusetts Colony, for the first four years following the transfer of the Charter, was committed to the hands of the excellent Winthrop, than whom, perhaps, no one better qualified for the office could well have been selected. But the wisest and best find that life is not all sunshine, and that popular favor is often inconstant. Among the hundreds who had emigrated to America, there were not wanting some of a factious temper, with whom liberty might easily degenerate into licentious ness. Nor were there wanting ambitious minds, eager for political preferment, and anxious to hear their own names \" Swell the trump of future fame.\" In the management of such a body of men, exulting in their escape from the oppressions of the mother country, and luxuriating in the sense of newly acquired freedom, it would not be strange if some errors were committed, or if those prejudices were awakened, which are easily induced by conceived assumption of authority in magistrates, or conceived encroachments upon civil and spiritual rights. Such assumptions were supposed to have been made ; and, attributing to Mr. Winthrop a desire to perpetuate his incumbency of the office he held, the freemen, full three hundred and forty in number,1 resolved to make their power felt in electing a new Governor. 1 Not three hundred and eighty, as in Bancroft, 1. 364.

We would by no means be under stood as asserting that he was perfect. He was a man, and had doubtless the failings of a man. Yet the gravity of his deportment, the calm and contemplative composure of his countenance, the complete control which he had gained over his passions, with his deep penetration, and his intui tive discernment of the characters and purposes of others, by even Clarendon are noted as extraordinary qualities, rendering him, if not the superior, at least the equal of Hampden ; 2 and his profound theological attainments, the purity of his mind, his easy and graceful eloquence, and the brilliance of his genius, won for him the warmest eulo giums of the gifted Milton, who is lavish of his encomiums upon the young champion of liberty. 3 Dark dissimulation was no attribute of his nature. 4 Whatever of enthusiasm he possessed, it was tinged with no fanaticism, stained with no hypocrisy; nor did it precipitate him into injudicious measures, or sanguinary excesses ; but added new luster to his acquired abilities, new powers to his natural sagacity ; 1 Neal's N.

It was a period of intense and vio lent excitement. Popular controversies had preceded his arrival ; and to the pressure of external aggressions, were added internal commotions of by no means a trifling nature.

Some of the principal persons, jealous of the enthu siasm with which he , was received, and of his intervention to heal the distractions of the Commonwealth,1 looked upon him with coldness and mistrust. And, \" more for things than persons, spirit than forms,\" and owning and cherishing goodness everywhere, the liberality of his heart, which refused to be tied down to all the formalities of the age, was little in unison with the cynical moroseness of a por tion of the clergy. Hence the day on which he was in vested with the purple of magistracy, saw a formidable opposition organized against him, determined to embar rass his government at every step ; and so well did his antagonists succeed in involving himself personally in diffi culties, and his most intimate friends in hopeless and inex tricable confusion, that his administration was brief and stormy; and, by the trials he encountered, he was painfully convinced of his mistake in accepting an office, which, under other and more favorable auspices, there can be no doubt he would have filled as acceptably and as successfully as either of his predecessors.2 The first open opposition to his views, was occasioned by an incident in keeping with the times, and illustra tive of the principles and policy of the colonists. Mr. Endicott had, some time before, cut the red cross from the flag at Salem, as a \" relic of Popery insufferable in a Puri tan community;\"3 and although his conduct was censured as \"rash and uncharitable,\" that censure, we apprehend, was quite as much dictated by his sympathy for Roger Williams, who was abjured as a heretic as by the conviction of his judges of the criminality of the act ; for not long 1 Winthrop, 1. 211-14. 2 See the admirable Memoir of Vane, by Rev.

VIII \"warily\" expressed their doubts of the lawfulness of the s^^, use of the cross in an ensign ; l and although some of the people \"stood stiff\" to retain the emblem, it was pro posed to change it to the \"red and white rose;\"2 and finally colors were appointed for every company, in which the cross was left out, and the King's arms were inserted Feb. i, in the flag on Castle Island. 3 Three months later the St. Patrick, a vessel belonging May 10, to Sir Thomas Wentworth, lord-deputy of Ireland, and afterwards Earl of Strafford, arrived ; and on approaching the Castle was boarded by the Lieutenant of the fort, and compelled to strike her flag. Of this act her commander complained as \" a great injury,\" and an apology was offered.4 Two weeks later one Miller, or Millerd, the May 31, master's mate of the Hector, because the King's colors were not displayed at the fort, denounced the colonists as \" traitors and rebels ; \" and being arrested and convicted, he was committed to prison ; but a tumult arising among his crew, he was released the next day on the recognizance of the Captain, and the day after, in the presence of the masters of the fifteen vessels then in port, he acknowledged his offense, and was discharged.5 Suspicious, however, that this submission was dictated by policy rather than by principle, and that his complaints might be renewed in England, and the affair become troublesome, Governor Vane desired the advice of the Captains respecting the omission of the flag ; and in a friendly spirit they replied, that it might be best to have the colors displayed, so that, 1 Winthrop, 1. 179, 183, 186. 2 Winthrop, 1. 490.

Two of the captains, however, offered the loan of their suits ; and though \" fully persuaded that the use of the cross in an ensign was idolatrous,\" a portion of the magis trates inclined to accept this offer ; and taking the colors, the Governor promised that they should be immediately set up. But a consultation being held over night with \" the ministers,\" of whom Mr. Cotton alone seems to have agreed with Mr. Vane, the next day Mr. Winthrop protested against placing the colors on the fort ; but, seconded by Mr. Dudley and Mr. Cotton, the Governor adhered to his original determination, and the colors were displayed.1 The controversy with Mrs. Hutchinson will be noticed hereafter. The part taken in this controversy by Mr. Vane, joined to other causes of dissatisfaction, so far excit ed the opposition of his associates, that before the expira tion of the year he was inclined to throw up his office and return home ; but by the persuasion of his friends he was dissuaded from taking that step, and remained at his post.2 May, The annual election in the following year took place in the midst of difficulties.

In the many important events which transpired dur ing this period, Mr. Winthrop bore his part with fidelity and discretion. In his participation in the controversies of the day, it is but just to remark that he seems to have been actuated not so much by bigotry, or a love of persecution, as by a conviction of duty. He regretted the harshness with which Roger Williams was treated ; and though a zealous opponent of Mrs. Hutchinson, and the enthusiastic Gorton, as he advanced in life his spirit became more cath olic, and he lamented the errors of the past ; so that when urged by Mr. Dudley to sign an order for the banishment of 1 Savage, on Winthrop, 1. 262 ; Mass.Rec's., 1. 188; Hubbard, 258-9.

The Plymouth people, in their trade with the Dutch, had learned of the existence of the beautiful Connecticut, known as the Fresh River, and it had been commended to them as a \" fine place for habita tion and trade;\" but their hands being then full, no use was made of this knowledge until some time after, when a company of Indians, driven out by the Pequots, visited Plymouth, and solicited a party to be sent to \" set up a trading house;\" and their circumstances permitting, they \" began to send that way,\" to discover the country, and to \" trade with the natives.\" The same Indians visited Bos ton to ask help from the Massachusetts Colony ; but, suspi cious of their intentions, their proposals were declined. Nearly two years later, a trading pinnace from Plymouth put in at Manhattan, and learning that the Dutch purposed erecting a fort \" twenty leagues up the \" Connecticut, Mr. Winslow and Governor Bradford journeyed to Boston to obtain aid to defeat this project ; but the people of the Bay, through jealousy or some other cause, refused to interfere.1 The messengers, on receiving this answer, intimated their intention to proceed on their own responsibility ; and return ing to Plymouth, a party was sent, under William Holmes, to take possession of the country, and erect suitable build ings. Here they were met by the Dutch, who had already purchased land of the natives and thrown up a slight entrenchment at Hartford, and commanded to withdraw ; but taking no notice of this command, they pushed on, and at the mouth of Little's river laid the foundation of Wind sor, fortifying their house with a strong palisade.

Mason, the main body of the fugitives was pursued. These fled to a swamp, which was surrounded ; nearly two hundred \" old men, women and children \" were taken pria- 1 Mass.

The magistrates of the colony at first discredited these reports ; but not knowing how much foundation they might have, it was deemed prudent to \"strengthen the watches in all the towns,\" and Capt.

At the meeting of this court, orders for the more strict observance of military Sep. s. discipline were passed ; and it was concluded to send two messengers to Miantonomo, to inform him of the rumors which were circulating, and to desire satisfaction.2 These messengers were courteously received ; rational answers were returned to all their propositions ; and the chieftain promised personally to visit Boston. On his arrival, an interview was held ; and the Governor acting as spokesman, in \"all his answers \" the Indian prince was \" very deliberate, and showed good understand ing in the principles of justice and equity, and ingenuity withal.\" His first demand was to be confronted with his accusers ; but this demand was refused, on the plea that his accusers were not known ; the reports were only general ; and they had preferred to give him a hearing before fully crediting the same. \" If you did not credit the reports,\" was his reply, \" why did you disarm the Indians ? \" \" For our security,\" was the answer.

Nearly two days were spent in this discussion ; but in conclusion, he \" accommodated himself to the satisfaction of the court, and was dismissed with presents.\" It was but a few days, however, before fresh tidings came from Connecticut, asserting the intention of the people there to commence a war ; but a new meeting of the mag istrates being held, letters were forwarded to dissuade them from their purpose ; and gradually the fears of the people subsided, and quiet was restored.1 In the following year, a war broke out between Uncas, the Mohegan chief, and Sequasson of Connecticut. Mian tonomo took the part of the latter, complained of the conduct of Uncas to the colonial magistrates, and requested permission to redress the wrongs of his confederate, which was granted. Raising an army of a thousand warriors, he attacked Uncas, whose men numbered but three or four hundred ; but with such ill-success that he was defeated and taken prisoner. The news of his capture reaching Providence, Gorton, of Warwick, demanded his release ; but taking his prisoner to Hartford, Uncas left him with the magistrates until his fate could be decided. At the meeting of the commissioners of the United Colo nies at Boston, his case came up for discussion. The magistrates were in a dilemma. It was their unanimous opinion that it would not be safe to liberate him, yet they had not sufficient grounds to condemn him to death. In this emergency, to shift the responsibility from their own shoulders, the advice of the clergy was asked, and ':all agreed that he ought to be put to death.\" He was accord- 1 Winthrop, 2. 95-102."], [251, "233 DEATH OF MIANTONOMO. ingly delivered up to Uncas ; two Englishmen were sent to chap. see that he was executed ; and as soon as the Mohegan y^-v-w sachem reached his own jurisdiction, at a given signal the * \" chieftain was attacked from behind, and with a blow from a tomahawk was killed ! x If by the \" pleading of an advocate \"2 and the \" opinion of a judge,\"3 the course of the commissioners and the clergy is unqualifiedly condemned, we should hardly have looked for an apology from a reputable divine.4 Policy may have prompted this step, but was it in accordance with Christianity? Well might the people of Rhode Island mourn the fate of Miantonomo, and drop a tear on his ashes, for he and Canonicus were the best aboriginal friends and benefactors their colony ever knew.5 Nor need we be surprised that the death of the chief enkindled the resent ment of his tribe, and that difficulties with the Narragan sets were often occurring. Yet such was the power of the English, and such was the weakness of the Indians, that the latter were generally subdued ; nor was it until after the lapse of thirty years, that any signal disturbance spread terror throughout all the settlements. There was peace for a generation, won by the sword. We cannot, however, forbear remarking, in closing this narrative of the earlier Indian wars, that, had the conduct of our fathers been less retaliatory, we should perhaps have been spared the necessity of reflecting upon the correctness of their policy ; nor would the pages of history have been stained with the sickening details of heads, scalps, hands and feet, as trophies of conquest.

The religious controversies in which the colony was early involved will form the subject of the present chapter ; and an acquaintance with these is highly necessary to a clear understanding of the history of those times. The Puritans came to these shores to establish a community of their own. Dissenting chiefly from the ritual and disci- pline of the Anglican Church, they designed to erect a church of a different description ; and, to protect themselves from aggression from whatever source it might spring, they resolved to exclude from their communion all who did not sympathize with their views, and who would not pledge themselves fully to their support. In this respect they imitated the conduct of the Church from which they had withdrawn ; and precisely for the same reasons that dis- senters were not tolerated in the bosom of the Episcopal Church, were they shut out from the privileges of the churches of Massachusetts. Puritans as well as Episco- palians assumed their own infallibility ; and, as Church and State were one and inseparable in Old England, they were bound together in New England ; and the purity of the former was deemed indispensable to the safety of the latter. This policy was resolutely adhered to ; and the laws which sanctioned it were as inflexible as the laws of the Medes and Persians. The correctness of such a policy may well be questioned ; but it was a policy which our fathers were in a measure compelled to adopt, in order to prevent the overthrow of their community. Nor was it long before they were called upon practically to apply it"], [254, "236 ROGER WILLIAMS. CHAP. IX. Feb. 9, 1030-1. Apr 12, 1031. While Europe and America were shrouded in the dark ness of religious intolerance, he who was to aid in showing a \" more excellent way \" had already entered the lists of theological warfare, and was ready to offer himself a sacri fice for the world's benefit. This was Roger Williams, who, from the alembic of his own soul, had evolved the sublime principle of liberty of conscience. Within six months after the settlement of Boston, he arrived in the Lyon, accompanied by his wife, the companion of his trials. An exile from England like most of the emigrants, he fled to these shores for freedom and repose. The poverty of his circumstances requiring early employment, he received a call to settle at Salem, as an assistant to Mr. Skelton, in the place of Mr. Higginson, recently deceased. This call was the commencement of a series of difficulties, which led to his banishment from the colony, and his removal to Rhode Island. Looking upon \" every national church as of a vicious constitution,\" the Church of England in particular was, in his estimation, so corrupt as to demand of all a renuncia tion of its communion ; and holding that \" the doctrine of persecution for cause of conscience\" was a \"Bloudy Tenent,\" \" most evidently and lamentably contrary to the doctrine of Christ Jesus,\" and that \" the power of the magistrate extended only to the bodies, and goods, and outward estates of men,\" he boldly demanded that the ecclesiastical should be wholly divorced from the civil power, and that the church and the magistracy should each be confined to its appropriate sphere.1 As these opinions, however excellent in themselves, were subversive of the policy of the Puritan as well as of the Episcopal Church, a letter was written to the brethren at Salem, requesting them to forbear to proceed in his settlement ; but the very day this letter was written 1 Cotton's Way, 72; Tenet Washed, 166; Reply, 26, 40, 61, 64, 77."], [255, "237 HIS SETTLEMENT AT PLYMOUTH AND AT SALEM. the church received him as her teacher ; and at the ensuing chap annual court he was admitted freeman.1 Before summer closed, his connection with this church11^18' was dissolved, and he removed to Plymouth. Here, as a Separatist, he was respectfully received, and as a preacher, his services were so acceptable that Governor Bradford says : \" I still bless God, and am thankful to him for even his sharpest admonitions, so far as they agreed with truth.\"2 For about two years he remained with this people, when the church at Salem, whose affection was undiminished, invited him to return. Elder Brewster, \" fearing his con tinuance might cause divisions,\" favored his dismission ;3 and, as he was sure of finding sympathy in his former abode, the call was accepted, and some of the Plymouth A]n^'t' church accompanied him to his home.4 Previous to his arrival, the ministers in the Bay had commenced a series of semi-monthly meetings, for debate ; and Mr. Skelton, doubtful of the tendency of these meet ings, was joined by Mr. Williams in opposing them.5 The latter had also written a treatise, questioning the right of the colonists to the lands they possessed, on the plea that they held them by a grant from the king rather than by purchase from the natives ; and that it was their duty to renounce the patent. For these \" errors and presump tions,\" order was given that \" he should be convented to Dec. 27. the next court to be censured ; \" and a letter was written to Mr. Endicott, wishing him to \" deal with Mr. Williams to retract the same.\" This letter was submissively received ; the reply of the accused was accompanied with the offer of his \" book or any part of it to be burnt ; \" and at the next court \" he appeared penitent, and gave satisfaction of lss&fc 1 Winthrop, 1. 63. \"Bradford, in Prince, 377, ed. 1826. 8 Cotton's Reply, 4; Morton's Mem. 4 Morton's Mem., 78; Hubbard, 203-4; Backus, 1. 56; Knowles, 52-3; Elton, 21.

To this demand no attention was paid, and he was duly inducted into the duties of his office. This \"great contempt of authority \" was an unpardonable sin ; the church was severely punished ; and, as he was supposed to have insti gated Mr. Endicott to cut the cross from the colonial flag, and to advocate the wearing of veils by women in church, these heresies, with the renewed charge of \" teaching pub licly against the king's patent,\" and terming \" the churches of England anti-christian,\" caused a summons to be issued for his appearance at the next court.2 By the following spring, other charges were preferred. An oath of fidelity had some time before been drawn up by the magistrates, to be administered to all non-freemen over sixteen years of age, to \" discover how the people stood affected to the public safety ; \" but Mr. Williams, esteeming \" an oath for confirmation of office to be peculiar to Christ, and that oaths, being a worship of God, it was not meet for unregenerate persons to take them into their mouths,\" he protested against their administration by the magistrates as unlawful, being a \" prostitution of the Holy name of the Most High to every unclean lip,\" and \" many millions of times taking that name in vain ; \" and being \" heard before 1 WTinthrop, 1. 145-7 ; Cotton's Tenet Washed, 4, 26; Reply, 27-8, 54; Williams's Reply, 276-7. 2 Winthrop, 1. 149, 164, 175, 180, 195; Cotton's Reply, 4, 29, 55 ; Hubbard, 164-5, 204-5 ; 1 M- H.

No one will say it was because he lacked ministerial abilities that he was compelled, with a heavy heart, to part from all dear to him, and plunge into the wilderness, where, \" sorely tost for one fourteen weeks, in a bitter winter season, not knowing what bread or bed did mean,\" he cast himself upon the hospitality of the sons of the forest !

Forgetting the advice of the poet, \" Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit,\" in her assemblies, unbridled license was given to that unruly member, the tongue ; and the minds of the people being highly excited, a feeble spark sufficed to kindle a formidable conflagration, and the flames of theological war fare burst out in many of the churches with such fury, that they threatened to consume all charity and forbearance.1 The opinions of Mrs. Hutchinson, which produced this heat, divested of the technicalities which have involved them in so much mystery, seem to have been as follows : As great stress was laid by the clergy upon the external evidences of sanctification or piety, gravity of deportment, precision of manners, formality of speech, peculiarity of dress, and other illusive signs of holiness, were held in such high estimation, that all destitute of these signs, however irreproachable in life or amiable in conduct, were consid ered unworthy to be called \" the children of God.\" Mrs. Hutchinson, in opposition to these notions, maintained that outward signs of discipleship might be displayed by a hyp ocrite, and hence that \" sanctification,\" which embraced these signs, was not infallible evidence of \"justification,\" or true Christian discipleship. The clergy also, who were believers in the personality of the Holy Ghost, denied for the most part His union with the regenerate in any sense ; but Mrs. Hutchinson, understanding this phrase to include an embodiment of spiritual graces or gifts, maintained that, in the true Christian, these graces and the Spirit had their 1 Pref.

The .ministers, perhaps with cause, suspected that Mrs. Hutchinson' s depreciations of external sanctity were insti gated, to some extent, by a satirical design, and that she purposed to reflect upon their own austerity;2 and when once it became a prevalent opinion that such was her design, the gall of bitterness entered their hearts ; new pungency was given to the sallies of her wit ; and her discourses were the more keenly relished by the discerning, who saw at whom her piercing shafts were adroitly leveled. \" Now,\" say her accusers in doleful terms, \" Now the faithful ministers of Christ must have dung cast on their faces, and be no better than legal preachers, Baal's priests, Popish factors, Scribes, Pharisees, and opposers of Christ himself.

The number of her friends, however, made this a matter requir ing delicate management ; for Governor Vane, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Wheelwright, were not to be despised as adver saries. Their first step, therefore, was to endeavor to counteract the influence of Governor Vane ; and at a con vention of elders and magistrates, called to \" advise about pacifying these differences,\" Mr. Dudley desired all to be \" free and open,\" and an animated and somewhat exciting discussion ensued. Mr. Peter, as the organ of the clergy, expressed their regret that Mr. Vane should be jealous of their meetings, and seek to restrain their liberty ; and plainly told him that, \" before he came, the churches were in peace.\" With equal spirit the Governor rejoined : \"The light of the gospel brings a sword, and the children of the bond-woman will persecute those of the free-woman.\" Mr. Wilson, the pastor of the Boston church, joined in the discussion, and made a \" sad speech,\" bewailing the condi tion of the churches, and the danger of separation if these things continued.

Mr. Wheelwright was accused of \"inveighing against all that walked in a covenant of works,\" and as \"stirring up the people with much bitterness and vehemency.\" His sermon was produced in support of this charge, and he justified it ; and though it still exists in manuscript,1 and few at the present day would probably regard it as a particularly exceptionable production, he was adjudged \" guilty of sedition and contempt.\" Governor Vane and others dissented from this verdict; but their protest was rejected. The Boston church also tendered a petition in his behalf ; and the court, finding the matter a serious one, deemed it prudent to \" defer sentence till the next court;\" and he was commended to the care of the Boston church, and enjoined to appear at the time appointed.2 Thus proceedings were instituted against the three prin cipal friends of Mrs. Hutchinson.

All, who had adhered to Mr. Wheelwright or Mrs. Hutchinson, or signed petitions or remonstrances in their favor, and who refused to acknowledge their fault, were disarmed ; the powder and arms of the country were removed to Roxbury for safety ; divers military officers were censured for being \" favorers of familistical persons and opinions ; \" a law was passed to punish by fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement or banishment, any who should \" defame any court, or any of its sentences ; \" and the proceedings of the General Court upon this whole affair, with the reasons, were sent to England to be pub lished, \" to the end that our godly friends might not be dis couraged from coming to us.\"2 ferred to is that usually quoted as Welde's Short Story, though it would appear from the statements of Cotton, Way, 56-8, and Baillie, Dissuasive, 57, 64, that only the Preface was written by Mr. Welde, and that the body of the work was from another hand. 1 Cotton's Way, 84-6 ; Winthrop, 1. 307-8, 309-11, 318, 322; 2. 18, 46-8 ; Johnson, in 2 M.

His idiosyncrasies were mysticism and enthusiasm ; and, conceiving himself inferior to no one in abilities or conse quence, he was usually in the attitude of opposition and defiance. Yet we are unwilling to admit that he possessed naturally a malevolent spirit, or that his character was radically and wholly corrupt. In either respect, it is quite probable, he was as good as the average of his accusers.

The civil history of every country is profoundly inter esting, as a development of the progress of mind in the \u25a0 sublime science of government ; and State and National laws are criteria of that progress, discovering, to the phi losophic observer, the different steps by which, as virtue and intelligence increase, communities advance to higher and still higher degrees of freedom and improvement. Especially has the jurisprudence of the Massachusetts Com monwealth peculiar claims upon our attention, as unfolding the principles and policy of the founders of that Common wealth. The Charter of Charles I. was the cherished pal ladium of their rights ; its broad seal was the sanction of the authority which was exercised ; and it was the intention of the grantees, under its provisions, to frame their laws, so far as practicable, in harmony with the laws of the land of their birth. With the Puritans, however, religion was the basis of civil as well as of ecclesiastical government. \" The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King,\" was practically their motto ; 1 and, planting them selves upon the position that, \" when a commonwealth hath liberty to mould his own frame, the Scripture hath given full direction for the ordering of the same, and that in such sort as may best maintain the euexia of the church,\" they \" fashioned the hangings to the house, and not the house to the hangings,\" and held that it was \" better the common- i 1 M.

By the terms of their charter, the lands they held were deemed exclusively their own ; and they claimed the right to receive or exclude strangers at their own discretion. \"If we here be a corporation,\" said they, \"established by free consent ; if the place of our cohabitation be our own ; then no man hath right to come in to us without our con sent.\" Hence, intending to build up an exclusively Puri- Sept. 7, tan community, one of their earliest acts was, to provide that no person should plant at any place within the limits of the patent, without leave from the Governor and Assist- 1 Cotton's Way, 27, and Letter, in Hutchinson, 1. 437; Johnson, in 2 M.

The second soon followed. As no terms of admission to the Company were prescribed by the charter, the colonists held in their own hands the key to their asylum ; and it was accordingly ordered, \" to the end the body of the com mons may be preserved of honest and good men, that, for the time to come, no man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body politic, but such as are members of some of the churches of the same.\" This was indeed a singular law, copied by the New Haven Colony, and virtually for a time by that at Rhode Island ; 4 and it continued substan tially in force until 1692, being repealed in appearance only after the restoration of Charles II.5 It was con demned by Roger Williams, in his controversy with the magistrates ; 6 and Episcopalians complained that, under its operations, liberty was jeopardized, and justice defeated.' 1 Mass.

And if it is regarded solely as a measure for the promotion ' \u2014 **-> of piety, there can be no doubt that it must be pronounced 1 1\" an unfortunate mistake; for piety cannot be promoted by making it the basis of civil or political distinctions. But we apprehend the true reason of this law has been generally overlooked. It was more a political regulation than a sectarian scruple. Not to bestow honors or privileges on piety was it passed, but to guard liberty, \u2014 to prevent encroachments upon their infant commonwealth. 1 The Puritans of Massachusetts recognized no rights founded upon Asiatic or European notions of indelible hereditary excellence ; no distinctions based exclusively upon talent or wealth ; yet necessarily, for a time, they were compelled to adopt the policy which excluded them from the Anglican Church, and erected a commonwealth of chosen people in covenant with God, in which the humblest freeholder, if sound in faith, possessed a power as great, in the election of magistrates and the enactment of laws, as a peer of the realm, or the proudest lord spiritual in the land of their birth. It may possibly be true that there were evils connected with this policy. It vested undue power in the clergy and the church. It established a practical oligarchy of select religious votaries. It debarred from the exercise of the elective franchise all, however honest, who were unwilling to conform to the standard of colonial orthodoxy. But at the same time, we doubt whether, in an age of so general exclusiveness, when all large bodies of Christians were more or less intolerant, and each was struggling for the ascendancy, and for temporal dominion, and only isolated, individual minds, were acting on a broader plane ; we doubt whether 'a different policy could have been safely adopted, without subjecting the colonists to what they 4 Cotton, in Hutchinson, 1. 437 ; Davenport, in Bacon's Disc., 33."], [289, "271 OATH OF ALLEGIANCE. would have regarded as the greatest of all evils, \u2014 the chap. intrusion of a body of men inimical to their views, whose -_~^ aim would have been to subvert their church and destroy their government. One other law remained to be enacted to complete their circumvallation. \" Upon intelligence of some Episcopal and malignant practices against the country,\" an oath was framed, to be administered to every male resident Apr. 1 1634. twenty years old and upwards, not a freeman, acknowl edging subjection to the colonial government, and promising obedience and conformity to the same. The design of this law is obvious. It was to secure the allegiance of all not entitled to the immunities of citizenship.1 Three laws like the foregoing, would probably be now regarded as eminently restrictive, exclusive and oppressive. But it must not be inferred from this that they were never of any service. On the contrary, to our minds, the course of the Puritans was at least as wise as that of the English Church. It was not a retaliatory, but a defensive policy which was adopted here ; and the laws being necessarily temporary, as the colony grew in strength and wisdom, and as its own circumstances, and the circumstances of the English Church changed, they were abrogated in course.2 The frame of the government of the colony was fixed by the charter. By its terms, the principal officers were to be chosen directly by the freemen ; but, as no rule was given how they should be elected, it was ruled that the Oct. is, freemen should choose the Assistants, and the Assistants from among themselves the Governor and Deputy.3 This change, however, which established an elective aristocracy, with no limitation of the tenure of office, was too anti- 1 Mass.

A few years later, it was provided that a 163G' portion of the magistrates should be chosen for life ; but this arrangement awakened jealousy, and was soon aban doned.1 The substitution of delegates to represent the freemen, was an early and an important change, completing and con solidating the power of the commonwealth.

For many years the contro versy continued ; the authority of the assistants being main tained, \" not by prodigies, or other arts, used by the people of Rome,\" but sometimes by a wise delay, and sometimes by a \"judicious sermon ;\" until finally, a compromise divi- ded the court into two branches, and gave to each a nega tive upon the other.1 This conflict of political opinion is worthy of notice. It is a remarkable feature in the history of our State, that, from the outset of its career, the two necessary elements of a popular government have ever been prominent ; and, from the freedom with which they have been exercised, are we doubtless to attribute the perfection and stability of our present institutions. Conservatism alone tends to arro gance and despotism. Radicalism alone tends to anarchy and ruin. The happy admixture of the two, is the foun dation of that system of checks and balances, which, while it prevents the perpetuation of obsolete laws, guards against the enactment of those which are cruder, and which expe rience may prove to be injurious or Utopian. Previous to 1635, the colony had no body of laws regu larly framed. But the increase of the population leading to apprehension of danger from the want of positive May 6, statutes, four of the magistrates were deputed, to make a draught in \"resemblance to a Magna Charta,\" which, being allowed by the ministers and the general court, were 'Legislative Papers, vol. 1. sol. 3; Winthrop, 1. 168-9 ; Mass.

It was six years, chap. however, before this code was completed, when a body of one hundred laws, principally compiled by the Rev. Na- thaniel Ward, of Ipswich, was established, which was called \" The Body of Liberties.\" These laws were revised at different periods, and were collected and published in 1648, 1660, 1672, and at other times.1 Much ridicule has been cast upon the colonists for the adoption of these laws, and it has been asserted that they are a \" literal transcript of the laws of Moses.\" But even if this is admitted, such predilection for the Mosaic polity was not confined to Massachusetts, nor was it peculiar to the Puritans. The Presbyterians of Scotland, asserted the obligation of the judicial laws of the Pentateuch, at least in criminal cases, and deduced therefrom the duty of execu ting idolators, adulterers, witches, and Sabbath breakers. Nay, even before their days, passages as strong as any in Puritan writings might be quoted from the writings of the early reformers.2 Hence, if it is admitted that the legisla tion of the colony was based upon the Mosaic polity, the Puritans were not alone in favoring that polity. Nor is it surprising that the settlers of Massachusetts should have been attracted by the legislation of the Hebrew Common wealth. The statutes of Moses were given to a nation emigrating from the bondage of Egypt to the Canaan of promise. They were designed for a free people, subject only to God. And their purpose was to preserve, in purity and simplicity, the worship of the Most High. Our fathers, therefore, might naturally be drawn to these laws, by their reverence for God, and the coincidence between their situa tion and that of the Jews. It is not, however, true, that the Mosaic polity was the ' Winthrop, and the Mass. Rec's. Also Hutch. Coll.; Force, vol. 3, Tract 9; 3 M. H.

On the con- 164i trary, its Body of Liberties, taken as a whole, may fear- lessly challenge comparison with the cotemporary legislation of England or any other land. Such a comparison was long ago instituted;2 and, from its perusal, no one can doubt that our fathers were familiar with Magna Charta, and that the \" Fundamentals \" of Massachusetts were not regarded as conflicting with the same. And well might they say, in 1646, in repelling the charge of arbitrary gov- ernment, illimited oaths, unjust taxes, illegal commitments, and others of a like nature : \" Let them produce any col- ony or Commonwealth in the world, where more hath been done in sixteen years. Let them show where hath been more care and strife to prevent all arbitrariness, and to bring all judgments to a certain rule, so far as may be.\" Indeed, they had no reason to be ashamed of their laws ; nor had they any reason to fear a comparison with the laws even of England. Let a few instances suffice to illustrate this statement. In the \" judicials \" of Mr. Cotton, nineteen offenses are capital ; in the \" Body of Liberties,\" twelve ; while in Eng land, at the same time, one hundred and fifty offenses were punishable with death. Ample protection was thrown around the life, honor, liberty and property of every citizen. Extra judicial oaths were abolished. Impressment for wars without the colonies was prohibited. No monopolies, save patents on new inventions, were to be granted. All lands and heritages, were to be free from fines, and licenses upon alienations, and from heriots, wardships, liveries, pri mer-seizins, year day, waste, escheat, forfeitures, and the whole train of feudal exactions customary upon the death of parents or ancestors : \u2014 yet the disposition of property, 1 Hutch.

Hereditary claims being v^^_, rejected, the laws of primogeniture and entail were so far 1641 modified, that the eldest son was only entitled to a double portion of the paternal estate, and the other sons, if the father died intestate, drew equal portions, after setting off the portion of the eldest. The rights of the widow were respected, and relief was afforded in case of neglect ; and daughters inherited as copartners in default of male issue. The shield of the law was thrown around orphans ; and the liberties of servants and foreigners were carefully defined. People of other Christian nations, professing the true Christian religion, and fleeing to the colony from the ty ranny and oppression of their persecutors, or from famine or war, were to be entertained and succored, \" according to that power and prudence God shall give us.\" Spoliation of the property of shipwrecked mariners was prohibited, and a refuge was provided for the sufferers. Bond-slavery, villanage, and captive vassalage, were permitted only in the case of \" lawful captives taken in just war, and such strangers as willingly sell themselves, or are sold to us.\" Yet even such were u to have all the liberties and christian usages which the law of God established in Israel required.\" The detestable practice of wife whipping was prohibited ; though \" chastisement \" might be administered by the au thority of the court, where just cause for correction existed. Torture, too, the peine forte et dure of the English law, was prohibited, except in capital cases, after conviction, for the discovery of confederates ; and even then, it was \" not to be barbarous or inhuman.\" But, though the statutes say : \" for bodily punishments, we allow amongst us none that are inhuman, cruel, or barbarous,\" cropping the ears, slitting the nose, branding the cheek, and whipping at the cart's tail were permitted, though such inflictions, if cotem porary history is to be credited, were less frequent here 24"], [296, "278 MORALITY OF THE PEOPLE.

In no country, we may truly say, was the moral condition of the people higher than in New England. Even Lechford, an Episcopalian, and no friend to the civil or ecclesiastical government of the colony, frankly says : \" Profane swearing, drunkenness, and beg gars are but rare in the compass of this patent.\"1 The Inspectors, in their Official report to Charles II., in 1673, say : \" The worst cottages of New England are lofted ; there are no beggars, and not three persons are put to death annually for theft.\"2 \"The air of New England,\" says Vincent, in closing his account of the Pequot War, \" and the diet, equal if not excelling that of Old England : besides, their honor of marriage, and careful preventing and punishing of furtive congression, giveth them and us no small hope of their future puissance and multitude of subjects.

But the dragon's teeth were sown, and a harvest of enemies was the speedy result. The stern discipline of Endicott, in expelling the Brownes, awakened, not unnaturally, suspicions that the new commu nity was not to be the sanctioned home of- Episcopacy.

But it was easily proved, in the case of the chief offenders, that punishment was not in flicted upon them because they were of the Episcopal Church, but because they were insubordinate to the colonial government; and Charles had discretion enough to see where the truth lay.

It will be obvious to all who carefully investigate the history of the transactions described in this chapter, that, at a very early period, the success of the Massachusetts Colony awakened the jealousy of all who had failed in establishing similar settlements on these shores ; and that advantage was artfully taken of the policy of the govern ment, and the disaffection of a few insubordinate and un principled men, to circulate extravagant and ill-founded reports, representing the people as rebels and traitors ; and, as the English nation itself was convulsed by the con test which had been long pending between Puritanism and Episcopacy, and the arbitrary measures of a tyrannical prince had exasperated the people, and aroused to resist ance the friends of freedom, the mind of his Majesty and his principal councillors was easily poisoned against the colony, and no pains were spared, by one means or another, to accomplish its overthrow, and its utter subversion. There is no evidence, we think, that the people of Massa chusetts had resolved systematically to renounce all alle giance to England. Their views of allegiance, it is true, differed materially from tnose which generally obtained. But within their charter, and in accordance with its terms, .and in harmony with those natural rights which were inalienably theirs, they cheerfully acknowledged depend ance on the parent State ; as Englishmen, they were proud of their nation and its honor ; and if different views after wards prevailed, or if their feelings became less cordial, and were gradually alienated and estranged, it is to be attributed more to the mistaken and persecuting policy which by ill-advice was adopted towards them, than to any inherent spirit of rebellion, or opposition or enmity to England and its government."], [313, "REFLECTIONS UPON THE DIFFICULTIES WITH ENGLAND. 295 CHAP.

And, in the midst of such arbitrary proceedings as were then grinding the nation into the dust, and which excited the abhorrence of all true patriots, ought it not rather to be spoken to the praise of the first settlers of Massachusetts, that the men who came here, under a Charter from the King, to which was appended that broad Seal regarded at home with an almost superstitious venera tion, steadily resisted his unrighteous attempts to curtail their liberties, defeated the machinations of their persever ing adversaries, and succeeded, in despite of all opposition, in spreading abroad throughout the whole land those dis tinguishing principles, which are the bulwark of the Eng lish Constitution, and which are the pride and the glory of the Constitution of the United States ?

The idea of this Confederacy seems to have originated with the colony of Plymouth, during the Pequot war. That colony, when solicited to furnish men and means for the war, objected on the ground that their Massachusetts brethren had refused to aid them in their difficulties with the French ; and in a conference at Boston, between the May 12> ' 1637. agents of Plymouth and the agents of Massachusetts, to promote harmony of action, proposals were made for an alliance, offensive and defensive, in all cases of future occurrence. x Nearly at the same time, similar proposals Apr. 1. were made by Massachusetts to the Hartford colony ; but the latter, jealous it should seem of their prosperous pre decessors, signified their unpreparedness to enter upon such negotiations, \" in regard of their engagements to attend the answer of the gentlemen of Saybrook about the same matter.\"2 A few months later, however, some of the magistrates and ministers of the colony being at Boston, to attend the Synod, a day was \"appointed to agree upon Aug. 30 ' Winthrop, 1. 261. 2 Winthrop, 1. 259."], [316, "298 SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW HAVEN COLONY.

John Davenport, Rev. Samuel Eaton, and others, gentlemen of respectability, influence and talent, a few of whom went thither in the fall of 1637, and were followed by the rest the ensuing spring, who landed at \" Red Hill,\" and, under the shadow of a spreading oak, laid the foundation of New Haven. Here they purchased land of the natives ; the little settlement thrived apace ; and continued under a plantation covenant about fourteen months, when a more systematic constitution was adopted, similar to that of Massachusetts. 2 We have elsewhere noticed the settlement of Hartford, Wethersfield, Windsor, and Springfield.3 As Massachu setts claimed jurisdiction over those of her inhabitants who had removed to Connecticut, and as the bounds between the colonies were not definitely fixed, in conjunction with Mr. John Winthrop, Jr., the agent of the English grantees, a commission was issued to Ludlow, Pynchon, Steele, and others, for the government of these plantations for one year ;4 but the settlers, impatient of external control, and satisfied that most, if not all of them, were without the limits of the Bay, established an independent government at the end of this year,5 and subsequently entered into a ' Winthrop, 1. 283-4. \u25a0 Winthrop, 1. 283, 311-12, 484 6; Hubbard, 262-3, 317-19; John son, in 2 M.

These Articles, thus altered, were sent to the General Court at Newtown; but June? the Court, disliking the alterations, declined accepting them ; and the delegates from Connecticut waiving any intention of intermeddling with the settlers in Massachusetts, the Court, thinking Springfield was within its limits, inclined to assume jurisdiction over that place, and inserted an article, so bounding the colonies as to include that plantation. This displeased the Connecticut people ; and it being re ported that they \" went on to exercise authority at Aga wam,\" the Governor wrote them to \" forbear until the line was laid out.\" To this letter a \" harsh reply \" was re turned, declining to \" treat further until they heard from the gentlemen at Saybrook,\" and owing to these miscar riages, the union was not effected.2 In the following spring, Mr. Haynes, the Governor of May? the Hartford Colony, and the Rev.

There were others, however, interested in these negotiations ; and Mr. Fenwick, of Say- Oct., brook, who had been written to, says : \" If there be any- thing between you and the towns above about bounds, what- soever is concluded without us here, I shall account invalid, and must protest against it.\" This checked further pro ceedings, nor until 1642, do we again find references to a Confederacy in which Connecticut is distinctly named.1 Of the progress of settlement in New Hampshire, we need only remark, that, after the death of Capt. John Ma son, the principal proprietary of those parts, the planta tions which had been erected were left to shift for them selves, his widow's attorney, Mr. Francis Norton, finding the expense of their maintenance to exceed the profits.2 Besides the settlements at Dover, Portsmouth, and Exeter, 1636. another was commenced at Winnicumet, or Hampton, where a house, known as the \" Bound House,\" was built, which was intended as a mark of possession rather than of bmits with the Massachusetts colony;3 and, though the agent of Mason's estate objected to these proceedings, it was not until many years after that these objections were seriously of litigiously urged.4 The difficulties at Piscataqua, growing out of the miscon duct of Burdet, Knollys, Underhill, and others, more prop erly belong to the history of New Hampshire, and may therefore be omitted here.5 Pending these difficulties, the 1639. inhabitants of Dover, aware of their own weakness, offered 1 Winthrop, 1. 360, 368; Hutch.

With this encouragement commissioners were appointed ; but, as the articles they brought were disliked, a conditional treaty was concluded, to the effect that \"they should be as Ips wich and Salem, and have courts there;\" and this was ratified under the seal of Massachusetts, with the under standing that, \" if the people did not assent to it, they might be at liberty.\" \"Those of Exeter\" sent similar propositions, but \" not liking the agreement with those of Dover,\" they declined proceeding further.1 The people of Dover and Portsmouth at this time had no power of government delegated from the Crown, but had combined themselves into bodies politic, like their neighbors at Exeter ; and in 1640, four distinct governments, includ ing one at Kittery, were formed on the branches of the Piscataqua ; but, being all voluntary agreements, liable to be broken or dissolved upon the first popular ferment, there could be no surety of their continuance, and no sta bility in their management. The distractions in England, which convulsed the whole nation, cut off all hope of the attention of royalty ; and the conflicting opinions of the settlements themselves, precluded the formation of a gen eral government which could afford a prospect of permanent utility.2 Hence the more judicious inclined to incorporate with the Massachusetts Colony ; and, as the bounds of the lat ter Colony extended northward to three miles north of every part of the Merrimac, and these bounds were yet intact, no accurate survey of the country having been made, and if pressed would include the whole of New Hampshire, and a 'Winthrop, 1. 384-5; 2. 32; Mass.

The North West line of Scituate was the colony line ; and 1633. the court at Plymouth, having granted to four gentlemen, usually called \" Merchant Adventurers,\" a large tract called \"the Conihasset Grant,\" Hingham, which then includ ed Cohasset, claimed part of the marshes on the East side of the \" Conihasset Gulph.\" This claim was resisted ; and commissioners were appointed from year to year for the adjustment of the difficulties ; but the question remained an open one even after the Confederacy was formed, nor was it until subsequent to the restoration of Charles n., that the line was amicably adjusted. 2 1 Mass.

French, to whom, by the treaty of St. Germains, the right to New France had been resigned, and who had established their settlements to the North of New England, had bought the Scottish settlement of Sir William Alexander, near Cape Sable, and that Cardinal Richelieu had sent companies of settlers, including priests and Jesuits, and that more were to follow. Alarmed by these tidings, a meeting was held at Boston, at which the ministers and captains were invited to be present, to advise what should be done should the French prove \" ill-neighbors ; \" and it was agreed, forthwith to finish the fort at Boston, to erect another at Nantasket, and to commence a plantation at Ipswich, to bar their entrance should they make a descent upon the coast. 2 In the fall, La Tour, the governor to the East of the Nov. 1 fist0 St. Croix, who had procured grants from the King of France, and who was determined to obtain possession of as much of the country as possible, visited Machias, where a trading house had been erected, and, laying claim to the place, two of the residents were killed, and the other three, with goods to the value of .\u00a3400, or \u00a3500, were taken and carried off.

The Plymouth people had, for some years, possessed a patent of lands at Kennebec, and had erected a trading house for the im provement of their grant ; and about this time, one Hocking, or Hoskins, came, in a pinnace belonging to Lord Say and Lord Brook, to interfere with their trade ; but two of the magistrates of Plymouth being present, of whom John Alden was one, they forbade his passage. Yet he went up the river, and a collision occurred, in which he killed one of his assailants, and was instantly shot himself in return. At the next court at Boston, upon the complaint of a kinsman of Hocking, Mr. Alden was arrested, and bound over with sureties to answer for the alleged murder. Upon this messengers were sent from Plymouth, to confer with the magistrates and ministers of Massachusetts ; and meet ing at Boston, after some discussion it was agreed, that the right of Plymouth to regulate the trade at Kennebec was good ; yet the death of Hocking was deemed \" in some sort a breach of the sixth commandment ; \" but, as it was partly an act of self-defense, it was on the whole adjudged to be \" excusable homicide ; \" and, after some further nego tiations with Capt. Wiggin, of Piscataqua, the affair was amicably settled, and Mr. Alden was discharged.2 'Winthrop, 1.117-18,139,184 2. 151-2, 219 ; Hubbard, 163 Hutchinson, 1. 33, 121; William son's Me., 1. 247-50. - Winthrop, 1. 156, 162-3, 166, 174; Mass.

But the enemy heard of the enterprise, and were found so strongly entrenched that no impression could be made upon them. Immediately, application was made to Massachusetts for aid. That colony was willing to grant this request, if the Plymouth people would bear all the expense ; but the latter refused to deal in the matter \" otherwise than as a common cause of the whole country,\" and \" all was deferred to fur ther counsel.\"1 It was partly in consequence of these French difficulties, ics4. that Mr. Winslow was sent to England, to petition the Council for aid to withstand their encroachments ; but negotiations were continued by Massachusetts, fearful for her own safety, and in the fall of 1636, a letter was ic3& received from D'Aulney, in which he proposed to claim no farther than Pemaquid, until he received further orders.2 At the death of Razilla, D'Aulney and La Tour, the great rival chiefs at the East, both claimed the command of Acadia, and made war upon each other ; and Mons.

The community was greatly divided in opinion relative to the propriety of aiding him ; fears were ex pressed that \" store of blood would be spilled in Boston ; \" and a discussion ensued, characteristic of the age, and well fortified with passages and precedents from the Old Testa ment ; but eventually, he was permitted to hire four vessels at his own risk, and, taking a few volunteers into his pay, he set sail, being instructed to parley before proceeding to extremeties. 3 Subsequently, a letter was written to D'Aulney, excul pating the colony, on the ground that neither Christianity nor humanity would permit them to reject the petition of La Tour, and affirming, that the volunteers who aided him 1 Winthrop, 2. 51.

There was, doubtless, a deep policy in thus play ing off these rival chieftains one against the other, to pre vent them from invading the colony ; but the interference of Massachusetts was unquestionably a violation of the neutrality which should have prevailed, and might have resulted disastrously ; for D'Aulney immediately went to France for aid, and was expected to return the next sum mer with a large force. Fortunately, a messenger was sent by him on his arrival, with proposals of peace ; and after some negotiation, a league was effected, and La Tour was left to the management of his own affairs. x The condition of the colonies at this period, in point of prosperity, is worthy a passing glance. The distresses of the first winter have been already alluded to ; and such was the scarcity, with the dearness of provisions in Eng land, that every bushel of wheat meal cost 14s. sterling, and peas were 11s., and beans 16s. per bushel.2 The emi grants, besides materials for their buildings, tools for their husbandry, and clothing for their families, brought with them neat cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry ; but to have lived upon these would have been injurious to their future interests, as upon their increase they were to depend for the supply of coming years. Their principal food, there fore, was Indian corn, which, before mills were erected, was prepared for domestic use by pounding it in mortars of wood or of stone.3 But the perils of the first winter were the severest they encountered; and, although there were ' For more ample details, see Mass.

New England, it is true, was not a terrestrial paradise, yielding, like Eden, \" every tree pleasant to the sight and good for food ; \" nor was it destitute of poisonous insects, venemous reptiles, and savage beasts ; yet was it far from being a wilderness of rocks, sands, and salt marshes, as its nia ligners represented it. Its air was salubrious, and its waters were pure ; and, notwithstanding the severity of its winters, and the frequency of its storms, with the attend ant sufferings, the skies of summer were fair and bright, and the tints of its autumnal scenery unsurpassed any where. Its soil lacked the fertility of the alluvions of the West, or the spontaneous exuberance of tropical climes, yet it amply rewarded industrious labor. Fuel was abund ant. Fish could be obtained whenever desired. And game, in the season of it, haunted the woods. It was a pleasant abode for cheerfulness and content ; and, as a majority of the planters were frugal and moral, all had bread enough to eat and to spare. Before 1643, there were supposed to be a thousand acres of land planted, for orchards and gardens ; fifteen thou sand other acres were under general tillage ; the number of neat cattle was estimated at twelve thousand ; and the number of sheep at three thousand. Many hundred labor ers, who \" had not enough to bring them over,\" and who hired themselves out for the payment of their passage, were now worth their scores, and some even hundreds of pounds, carefully invested in lands and stock.

New buildings, some v^w/ even of brick, sprung up in every quarter of Boston ; markets were erected ; wharves stretched into the harbor ; native and foreign vessels were sent to the West Indies, and to the Madeira Islands, and returned laden with sugar, oranges, wine, cotton, tobacco, and bullion ; and these, with the furs, and the products of the fisheries at the Cape and at the Banks, including morse teeth and oil, procured in trips further to the North, were sent to England to pay for the manufactured goods needed for their wants. The resources of the country were rapidly developed. The vast forests which clothed its surface, were converted into masts, planks, boards, staves, shingles, and hoops, all which were of value in commercial change.1 Before 1650, 1650. glass works were commenced ;2 and iron foundries were established, at Lynn and Braintree, in the Massachusetts Colony, and at Raynham, in Plymouth.3 Mills were likewise erected, and ship yards established ; and some slight pro gress was made in the manufacture of linen and cotton cloth.4 The facilities for domestic manufactures were ample and available. Wool was becoming plenty ; flax and hemp could be easily raised ; large quantities of hides had been imported ; and water privileges were to be found within the limits of nearly every town. But the farmers deemed it more for their profit to exchange cattle and corn for clothing ; 5 and, as the yeomanry were the body of the 1 Danforth, in his Almanack for 1648, has the following rude lines relating to the early commerce of the colony: \" Wh\"'' P\u00b0rk' biSke'' Masts, p'rpe-staves, fish should store both '\";\"\"!L'\"\"r'- , k . ., Which fetch in wines, cloths, sweets and good tobac \u2014 O be contented then, ye cannot lack.\" 2 Mass.

J Nor were the interests of education forgotten or over looked. Scarcely had the settlers of Massachusetts emerged from the struggles which they encountered upon their arri val in this country, ere their solicitude to secure for their posterity benefits similar to those which themselves had enjoyed in the land of their birth, led to measures for the erection of a seminary, which should enlarge into a College, and eventually into an University, competing with the most famed institutions of the Old World.2 A large proportion of the clergy of New England, and some of the laity, were men of a liberal education, and were graduates of the time honored Universities of England. The materials of great ness were already theirs, for they brought with them to these shores, in addition to their libraries, minds richly stored with the treasures of learning. But without the perpetuation of this learning, it must die with its possses sors. Its diffusion could be secured by instruction alone. Hence, no sooner were churches erected, than school-houses sprung up, \"Fast by the oracles of God.\" Learning and religion were united by indissoluble bonds, and intelligence and virtue were the consequent fruit. o^-28' Six years after the settlement of Boston, and in the autumn of the last of those years, the General Court, with 'Winthrop, 2. 21,26,37. 2 New England's First Fruits, ed. 1643, p .9, et seq."], [329, "311 HARVARD COLLEGE. a liberality which for ages will memorize its wisdom, voted chap. the sum of .\u00a3400, equal to a year's rate of the whole vj^ colony, towards the erection of a \" public school or col lege,\" of which \u00a3200 was to be paid the next year, and the balance when the work was finished.

One half his whole property, and his entire library, was the amount of this bequest : a sum greater than that appropriated by the Court f and, though larger bequests have since been received, the benefaction was so timely, and the sum so generous, that the name of the legator was at once con ferred upon the College, and it still owns him as its princi pal and earliest founder.3 The \" school \" which this donation assisted in starting, was at first under the superintendence of Mr. Nathaniel Eaton, who had charge of the funds and buildings, as well as of the pupils ; but his scandalous conduct, and the com plaint of \" short commons,\" through the parsimony of his wife, soon led to his dismission, and his departure from the Colony.4 In 1638, the regular course of academic instruc- less.

The institution thus started, was fostered by all favorable to its interests, and the clergy and the laity vied with each other in con- tributing to its funds. The Commissioners of the United Colonies lent to it their influence ; liberal patronage was received from abroad ; and before the grant of the Prov- ince Charter, in 1692, the office of President had been held by a succession of distinguished men ; a large number of students had graduated from its halls ; and the institution itself had materially contributed to the prosperity of the colony, and to the promotion of its highest and most per manent interests.3 The grammar school at Cambridge, established at a very early period, and nearly coeval with the settlement of that town, under the charge of famed \" Master Corlet,\" taught the preparatory branches, a certain degree of acquaintance with which was necessary for admission to the college ; Watertown, Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, and other towns, from their humble temples of learning, contributed their quota of scholars ; from the colony of 1 For their names, see the Cata- logues, and comp.

Poverty prevented many from giving their children the highest advantages ; but comparatively few could be found whose instruction had been wholly overlooked. The literary attainments of the age, it is true, were not extensive ; yet there was no idle waste of superfluous energy here.

Yet were there not wanting a few restless minds ; a few J^, who sought for fairer climes and richer fields. And there *?? were others abroad to foster this spirit, and to flatter the 1643. hopes of those who desponded. Some, who had been bene- factors of the colony, were projecting new settlements in the region of the tropics, and among the Bahamas. Lord Say and Seal was the prominent patron of this enterprise ; and Mr. Humphrey, one of the Assistants, was persuaded to enlist in the design, by proffers of high offices, which are tempting to ambitious minds. A plan of government was formed, supremely aristocratical,with hereditary magistrates, and orders of nobility ; but as this was repugnant to the repubbcanism of the Puritans, it was subsequently changed, and assimilated more to that of Massachusetts. Mr. Win throp, the Governor of Massachusetts, was not very friendly to this scheme. New England was his chosen home, en deared to him by his sacrifices and labors on its behalf. And it grieved him to think there were any, who would withdraw from it their support and encouragement, or transfer their affections to another and more dangerous clime.1 The principal town of the new colony was called Providence ; thither a large number of families were sent ; and favorable reports were spread of the ease and plenty which they were bountifully enjoying ; but ere long, this \" thriving town \" was \" taken by the Spaniards, and the lords lost all their care and cost, to the value of above \u00a360,000.\" 2 This disaster checked further emigration ; and, though many returned to England to participate in the stirring events which were there transpiring, the majority of the colonists contentedly remained, and applied them selves with fresh ardor to the upbuilding of their com monwealth, and to those schemes of industry which prom ' Winthrop, 2. 104-5. 2 Winthrop, 1. 399,401; 2. 15 16, 31, 39, 40; Hubbard, 376-9."], [333, "REVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF THE COLONY. 315 CHAP XI. 163ft to 1U4.3. ised to be of permanent utility and value. How eventful had been their history from the period of their landing on these shores ! Less than a quarter of a century had elapsed from the settlement of Plymouth, and but little more than half that number of years from the settlement of Boston. Connecticut was in its infancy, its eldest colony being but eight years old, and its youngest but five. With some of the savage tribes which besprinkled the country, they had engaged in a deadly and exterminating strife ; and the friendship of the rest was fickle and inconstant. Plots for their overthrow, and rumors of hostilities, were daily ma turing and reaching their ears. Our fathers felt painfully their insecurity and danger, and that they rested upon the verge of a slumbering volcano, whose streams of desolation might at any time overleap the feeble barriers which restrained them, and pour a desolating tide of lava over the country. Nor was their situation much better with respect to the French and the Dutch. At the East and at the West, their enemies were subtle, and would rejoice at their downfall. The settlers of New England were comparatively but a handful. But the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Encompassed by dangers, and con scious of their weakness, what more natural, in the hour of peril, distant as they were from the land of their birth, and dependent upon God and their own right hands for their preservation and support, than that they should seek to weave a four-fold cord, not easily broken: \u2014 to combine in a Confederacy for mutual aid ?

And what was the amount of their debt to the mother country ? They had a charter : but it was paid for. They had governments: and little thanks to those who would have prevented it if they could ! Little thanks to the ene- mies who sought to curtail their privileges, and deprive them of their rights. The conduct of Charles shows with what feelings he regarded the exiles. What battles had he fought for them ? What aid had he furnished, to deliver them from their enemies ? His acts towards the colonies had been eminently aggressive, oppressive, and ruinous : \u2014 for can we otherwise characterize his Orders in Council ? \u2014 his restrictions upon emigration ? \u2014 his attempts to destroy even the feeble tenure of the charter ? What, I again ask, had England done for the colonies ? Not even had she treated them with \" contemptuous neglect,\" as has been asserted. All that had been achieved, had been achieved in despite of the opposition of foes.

None were to be admitted to it but those of their own faith, sympathizing with their views, and subscribing to their creed.

The colony at Portsmouth, too, must likewise repent of its sins, or come under the jurisdiction of Plymouth, to be received into communion. And as for Gorton and his followers, they were reprobates of the worst stamp, in the estimation of the churches of the day.

If there were personal ends to be answered, where have not human actions been more or less tainted with the spirit of selfish ness ? Instead, then, of condemning the colonists for what they left undone, let us see what they sought, and what they accomplished by this Confederated Union. The Preamble to the Articles of Confederation, is a state ment of the motives which prompted its formation : \u2014 \" We all came into these parts of America with one and the same end and aim, viz : to advance the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to enjoy the liberties of the gospel in purity with peace : and whereas, by our settling, by the wise providence of God, we are further dispersed upon the seacoast and rivers than was at first intended, so that we cannot, according to our desire, with convenience commu nicate in one government and jurisdiction ; and whereas we live encompassed with people of several nations and strange languages, which hereafter may prove injurious to us or our posterity ; and forasmuch as the natives have formerly committed sundry insolences and outrages upon several plantations of the English, and have of late com bined themselves against us, and seeing by reason of the sad distractions in England, (which they have heard of,) and by which they know we are hindered both from that humble way of seeking advice, and reaping those comfort able fruits of protection, which at other times we might well expect ; we therefore do conceive it our bounden duty, without delay, to enter into a present consociation among ourselves, for mutual help and strength in all future con cernment, that, as in nation and religion, so in other respects, we be and continue one, according to the true tenor and meaning of the ensuing articles.\" These Articles are twelve in number. The first fixes the name : \" The United Colonies of New England.\" The"], [337, "THE CONFEDERACY. 319 second is a declaration of a firm and perpetual league of chap. yi friendship, offensive and defensive, for preserving and prop- v^v^, agating the truth and liberties of the gospel, and for their IG43 own mutual safety and welfare. The third is an assertion of the right of jurisdiction of each colony within its own limits, and confines \"the Confederacy to the four colonies forming it, unless otherwise agreed. The fourth states the rule to be followed in the apportionment of expenses upon the colonies, for the maintenance of war, by an assessment upon all males between the ages of sixteen and sixty. The fifth prescribes the course to be pursued by each colony in case of an invasion of its territory, to secure the aid of the rest ; and the quotas of men to be sent to their relief. The sixth gives to each colony power to elect two commis sioners, fully authorized to act in its behalf; six of the eight agreeing upon any measure, the same to be binding ; otherwise, the propositions to be referred to the courts of the colonies, and concluded by their consent. The meetings to be held annually and alternately in the colonies on the first Thursday in September. The seventh provides for the election of a president of the board. The eighth pro vides for the passage of general orders, and the rendition of fugitive servants and criminals. The ninth debars either colony from engaging in war, unless compelled to, without the consent of the rest. The tenth provides for calling extraordinary meetings. The eleventh proffers redress for grievances in the breach of these articles. And the twelfth is a ratification and confirmation of the whole. These measures were initiated May 19, 1643, and ratified on the 7th of the following September.1 Such was the New England Confederacy of 1643, the model and prototype of the North American Confederacy of 1774. That it was an assumption of sovereignty, is too 'Winthrop, 2. 119-27; Morton's Hazard, vol. 2; Plym. Col.

MASSACHUSETTS AND THE COMMONWEALTH. For three years previous to, and for seventeen years chap. following the Confederacy of 1643, the theatre of exciting -^^^ events was transferred, in a great measure, from the New 1^3 World to the Old ; yet these events exerted a powerful 16s6 influence upon the fortunes of New England, strengthening and developing that deep love of freedom which constitutes the charm of our national history. The price of liberty is said to be eternal vigilance ; this liberty had been tasted here ; and the boon was too precious to be cast lightly aside. It is no disparagement to our ancestors, it is rather to their honor, that they earnestly sought to secure this blessing, and to transmit it as an invaluable inheritance to their posterity. Freedom is the inalienable birthright of man. Dear is it to all, for it is God's gracious gift. And especially when based upon the gospel of Christ, when it breathes the air of spiritual life, and guides the soul onward to everything noble, is it the proudest and most elevating prerogative of our race. Such was the character of free dom in New England. Progressively unfolding with the advancement of truth, it encountered at first the usual ob stacles. It partook of the infirmities incident to humanity. It was blended with harshness, bigotry and intolerance.

Liberty in England existed but in name ; and to its revival, that nation is largely indebted to the efforts of the Puritans. It has long been the fashion to deride this sect, and to brand it as an embodiment of cant and hypocrisy. Few have comprehended the importance of its mission ; fewer have awarded it its- just meed of praise. It is so easy to misjudge ; it is so easy to join in the sneer against principles which are despised and contemned, that the spirit which animated the body of the Puritans has been undervalued, and lost sight of, by those whose prejudices incline them to speak lightly of every thing not according with their own views and opinions. Hence, even in our own day, Doctors of \"the Church\" have entered the lists to shiver a lance in the crusade against \" Puritanism,\" and grave Tory Judges have sullied the purity of the ermine of justice, by repeating stale slanders, and retailing their wares as genuine and new. Magnum contumelies reme dium, negligentia. The revolution in England, which hurled from his throne and sent to the scaffold Charles the First and his wretched advisers, was an event which might have been prophesied years before it transpired. The monarch who tramples upon the necks of his subjects must expect retribution, unless the spirit of freedom is crushed out and annihilated. Tyranny weaves the web of its own destiny, and, when caught in the meshes, it struggles in vain to escape from its prison. Such was the experience of the ill-fated Charles ; and those who had suffered the most from his cruelty, were the instruments to accomplish his ruin and death. its*M0. From the dissolution of the Parliament of 1629, to the assembling of the Long Parliament, in 1640, the nation was ruled, in civil affairs, by the tyranny of Charles and his Ministers of State, and in ecclesiastical affairs, by the ty- ranny of Laud and the prelates of the Church.

The nobility, however, by birth and by station, were the advocates of royalty, and the friends of conservatism. The Presbyterians were favorable to a limited monarchy, if complaisant to their creed. The Puri tans alone were the harbingers of republicanism. The three parties combined, proved a powerful opposition, which Commenced a series of important reforms, broke up the High Commission Court, abolished the Star Chamber, sent Laud to the Tower, Strafford to the scaffold, and Finch into exile. But when these ends were attained, the nobility were satisfied ; and, fearing that innovation, if pushed too far, might terminate in anarchy, they inclined to retrace their steps, and to compromise with the King, listening too favorably to his protestations of fidelity to the interests of his subjects. The Presbyterians and Puritans were earnest to continue the work which had been begun, and to rectify abuses which had long been a subject of grievance and complaint. Contending for equality against privilege, and for freedom against prerogative, the assumptions of royalty they were determined to restrain ; the liberties of the people they were anxious to enlarge ; the corruptions of the church they were resolved to remove ; and, resenting an act of the grossest injustice, an invasion of the rights and privileges of Parliament, the Monarch became a fugi tive and an exile from London.

The latter, for a season, struggled against difficulties, lacking disci- plined troops ; but when Cromwell enlisted, and his extra 1644. ordinary genius was bent to remodel the army, a change was soon visible : the Ironsides were invincible : Charles was made prisoner : Parliament was purged : the Presbyte rians were routed : the Puritans gained the ascendency : their chief became the arbiter of the destinies of the na 1649-50. tion : the Monarch was beheaded : and England was de- creed a Commonwealth. But revolution stopped not here. The victorious troops were turned againt the Common wealth, still loyal to liberty ; and Cromwell, by a fatal mis take, pushed rashly on his schemes of personal aggrandize- ment, until he was declared Lord Protector, and pompously May 12, enthroned as the head of the State. In a twelvemonth more he was numbered with the dead. Richard, his son, was subdued by faction. Mark shared the same fate.

And it was probably from some of these that letters were received, advising that persons should be sent Mar. is, to solicit for the colonies, and giving hope that their requests would be favorably entertained. But too prudent were the statesmen of New England to subject themselves voluntarily to external control. \"If we put ourselves under their protection,\" they argued, \" we must be subject to their laws, in which, though they may intend our good, it may be prejudicial to us.\" Hence the flattering invitation was respectfully declined, though agents were sent \u2014 Mr. Hibbins, Mr. Welde, and Mr. Peter \u2014 to \" mediate ease in Aue. 3, customs and excise,\" and to obtain supplies for the benefit of learning.2 Shortly after, by visitors in England, a petition was pre ferred \" for redress of that restraint which had been put upon ships and passengers ;\" and an order was passed, \" that the colonies should enjoy all their liberties according to their patent:\" \u2014 \" whereby,\" adds Winthrop, \" our patent, which had been condemned, and called in upon an erro neous judgment, in a quo warranto, was implicitly revived and confirmed.\"3 At the end of a year, Mr. Hibbins, one of the agents, Sep., the use of the poor, the trans portati\u00b0n of poor children, the use of tb<; College, the advancement of learning, the enlargement of the library, and the conversion of the Indians, with the disposition of these funds, and a personal vindication from certain false charges, &c.

It is probable that this commission was principally designed to apply to the West Indies ; but, as its terms included all the colonies, all were under its control, and protections and patents were granted, and sub-commissions issued for the furtherance of its objects.* 1 Mass.

Stagg, authorizing him to take all vessels, inward or outward bound, from Bristol, Barnstable, and Dartmouth, in hostility against the King and Parliament, and to visit all ships, in any port or creek, seizing and confiscating those which refused peaceably to submit. In the harbor between Boston and Charlestown, there lay a small Bristol Jun. 23, ship, laden with fish for Bilboa ; and this vessel was visited by Capt. Stagg, who produced his commission, and demanded its surrender within half an hour. The news of this act spread like wild-fire through the town, and before the half hour expired, Windmill, now Copp's Hill, was thronged with spectators to see the issue, among whom were some interested in the ship, especially a Bristol merchant, who \" began to gather a company, and to raise a tumult,\" for which he was arrested, and committed until the excitement was over.1 As there was to be a Court soon at Salem, thither Capt. Stagg was cited to appear; but the ministers, thoroughly aroused, began publicly from their pulpits to condemn his proceedings, and to exhort the magistrates to \"maintain the liberties of the people,\" which were violated by this act. Some were in favor of forcing the commissioner to restore the ship ; but the majority being of a different judgment, he was permitted to retain it. The grounds taken in this discussion are worthy of notice. \" This,\" said they, \" can be no precedent to bar us from opposing any commission truly dangerous to our liberties ; for it is the motto of the present powers, that salus populi is suprema lex.

As in the army of Xeno- phon, so in Massachusetts, boundless liberty of speech was indulged ; and the magistrates and the clergy, the civil and spiritual Xenophons, were as earnest as any. Political discourses were frequently delivered ; and at every annual Court, one of the ministers was appointed to preach an \" Election Sermon.\" The power of the clergy was every where felt, and seldom was any affair of importance under taken without their advice.

Mr. Nathaniel Ward, of Ipswich, the framer of the \" Body of Liberties,\" and the author of that singular work, the \" Simple Cobler of Agawam,\" a republican of great energy, and fearless in the expression of his opinions, 1641. delivered a sermon, \" grounding his propositions upon the old Roman and Grecian governments,\" and advising the people to \" keep all their magistrates in an equal rank.\" He also opposed the practice, then common, of giving pri vate advice in suits at law. \" But,\" said the magistrates, with no little warmth, \" are we to be tied down to old Roman and Grecian precedents ? If God makes men wiser than their neighbors, and if these times have the advantage of former times, in experience and observation, can we not, by these helps, frame better than heathen laws ? Be sides, to make all magistrates equal, is against the practice of Israel, where some were rulers of thousands, and some of but tens. And if magistrates may not give private advice, we must have lawyers to plead in our courts ; and of this dreaded fraternity we are now happily clear. If magistrates may not grant original processes, for what pur pose are they entrusted with power ? By noticing cases before they are brought to court, difficulties may be often ended without charge or trouble. Such pre-knowledge, also, saves time in arguing cases. It is allowed in crim inal, and why not in civil suits ?

One of these related to the appointment of the Court preachers. At first, such appointments were made by the assistants ; but when the house of deputies was established, they claimed the appoint ing power.2 It was by the freemen that Mr. Ward was chosen, in 1641, and Mr. Rogers, in 1643. These, there fore, represented the democracy of the country, as the preachers chosen by the assistants represented the aristoc racy. In 1645, the contest was brought to an issue. At the preceding October Court, Mr. Norton, of Ipswich, was chosen by the deputies to preach at the next election ; but two months before the election, the magistrates met, and chose Mr. Norris, of Salem. Here were two chosen : which should officiate ? It was put to the vote, and the deputies triumphed. The choice fell upon Mr. Norton, and Mr. Norris was rejected. The magistrates were cha grined at this defeat, and expressed their fears that, by submitting to such decisions, countneance would be given to unjust usurpations. \" Out of court,\" said they, \" the deputies have no power.

A commission was drawn up by the deputies, authorizing seven of the magistrates, and three of the dep- uties, with Mr. Ward, of Ipswich, to \" order all affairs of the Commonwealth in the vacancy of the general court.\" This proposition was repelled as dangerous, tending to subvert the foundations of the government ; and the depu- ties were desired to \" consider of a way how this danger might be avoided and the liberties of the freemen preserved inviolable.\" A conference was held. The exceptions of the magistrates were, that the creation of general officers was reserved to the courts of election ; that four of the magistrates were omitted in the commission ; and that the commission itself was contrary to the patent. In reply, precedents were urged, in the appointment of councils of war, and other similar departures from the charter ; and it was contended, that the assistants had no power but what was given them by the court. The magistrates denied the validity of these precedents, and urged, that the patent had been varied from only in non-essentials ; and that the fact of the election of governor and assistants implied authority to govern at all times,* otherwise, in the vacancy of the, courts, there was no power to order, dispose, or punish, in cases where there was no positive law. 1 Mass.

A difficulty within the colony was the precursor of the most serious of these complaints, and revived the old strug gle between the magistrates and the freemen. An election of military officers had taken place at Hingham ; but the people, dissatisfied with the officer sent up for confirmation, made a new choice. The magistrates, taking the part of the rejected candidate, were involved in a dispute with the friends of the second, at the head of whom was Mr. Hobart, the pastor of the church at Hingham, who was apprehended for his alleged insubordination.

The principal persons connected with this controversy were, William Vassall, of Scituate, a prominent member of the church in that town, and an original member of the Massachusetts Company ; Dr. Robert Child, of Hingham, a physician from Padua, and a gentleman of respectable scientific attainments, notwithstanding he was suspected as a \" Jesuit ; \" and Mr. Samuel Maverick, a zealous Episco palian, who occupied Noddle's Island before the settlement of Boston. The movement began in Plymouth, by a propo sition for a \" full and free tolerance of religion to all men that would preserve the civil peace and submit unto govern ment ; and there was no limitation or exception against Turk, Jew, Papist, Arian, Socinian, Nicolaitan, Familist, or any other.\" \" You would have admired,\" wrote Wins low, \" to have seen how sweet this carrion relished to the palate of most of the deputies.\" Knowing, as we do, the views of the Pilgrims, is it sur prising that such a proposition alarmed the thoughtful, and was esteemed dangerous above all others to the peace of the1 churches ?

For the magistrates of Massachusetts, vigilant to preserve the purity of the churches, and to suppress every attempt to open a breach in the walls of their spiritual Zion, took prompt and decided action in the premises ; and a declara tion was set forth, in reply to the petition, in which its charges were examined with freedom, if not with cogency. As an efficient agent would be needed in England to answer these charges, should they reach Parliament, and the charges of Gorton, who had already crossed the Atlan tic, Mr. Edward Winslow, of Plymouth, was chosen for that purpose -,1 and, as the matter was one of \" great con cernment,\" the elders were called in, Mr. Hobart only being excluded, and the doors being closed, a discussion ensued, embracing the relation of the colonies to England. \" By the charter,\" it was decided, \" full and absolute power is conferred upon the Company.

The proclamation rela tive to Virginia, asserted, in general terms, the power of appointing Governors and Commissioners to be placed in all the English colonies, without exception ; and by Mr. Winslow, their agent in England, they were informed, that it was the pleasure of Parliament the patent of Massachu setts should be returned, and a new one taken out, under which courts were to be held, and warrants issued. With this request the people were indisposed to comply ; and, too wary to hazard the liberties so dearly purchased, a petition was drawn up, pleading the cause of the colony with great unction, setting forth its allegiance, and express ing the hope that, under the new government, things might not go worse with them than under that of the King, and that their charter might not be recalled, as they desired no better. This remonstrance was successful ; the measure was dropped, and the charter of Charles continued in force. Parliament was not \" foiled \" by the colony. Its request was deemed reasonable ; and there was no disposition to invade forcibly its liberties. We have evidence of this in the course of Cromwell. After his success in the \" Emerald Isle,\" conceiving the project of introducing Puritanism into Ireland, an invita tion was extended to the people of Massachusetts to remove thither, and settle. But they were too strongly attached to the land of their adoption, and to its government, \" the happiest and wisest this day in the world,\" readily to desert it. Hence the well-meant proposal of the Lord Protector was respectfully declined. 2 With their letter in reply to his request, the Petition to Parliament was sent, and his intervention was solicited, to avert the sad consequences apprehended from the recal of the Charter ; and though we have no positive evidence that he interposed directly in 'Hutchinson, 1.

The former established its council of war ; 5 and the latter, to make its bullion available, and to protect itself against a fraudu lent currency from abroad, established a mint, which sent forth shillings, and sixpences, and a few coins of a smaller denomination, to be circulated among the people.6 Yet their relations to the neighboring colonies were not alto gether friendly ; and especially with the Dutch, difficulties ' Hutch.

The establish- ment of this mint by Massachusetts, was a fruitful source of difficulty after the Restoration, and is speci- fied as a prominent charge against the colony, in the instrument by which the charter was dissolved, in 1684. It was regarded by the gov- ernment as a virtual assumption of independence, and as an encroach- ment upon the prerogative of the King.

When war was declared, however, between England and Holland, no disposition was manifested to commence hostili- Oct., ties in America. The Dutch colony at Manhattan, though it did not lack the disposition, was itself too feeble seri- ously to annoy the settlers of New England ; and the mer chants of Boston carried on too profitable a trade in those parts, to desire at once to break it up. Hence, in an address from the General Court to Cromwell, x the pacific intentions of the people were frankly avowed ; nor was it until rumors were circulated by the Indians, that the Dutch 1653. Governor was privately soliciting them to a general con federacy to extirpate the English, that alarm spread through all the colonies. But even then, the evidences of the con spiracy were not deemed sufficient to warrant a war. The Dutch disclaimed any sinister intentions, and the elders, to whom the subject was referred, advised that it would be \" safest for the colonies \" to forbear the use of the sword, but to \"be in a posture of defense, and readiness for action, until the mind of God should be more clearly known. \" 2 Upon the repetition of these rumors, the Connecticut May 26. colonies were earnest for war ; and letters were sent to the Commissioners urging its commencement ; petitions to the same effect were presented from towns in Massachu setts;3 and the Commissioners themselves, all but one, were in favor of complying ; but the General Court of Massachu setts interfered, and declared, that \" no determination of the Commissioners, though they should all agree, should bind them to join in an offensive war, which should appear to be unjust.\" This declaration led to an altercation, which seriously threatened the dissolution of the Confede racy ; but Massachusetts was firm ; the other colonies were ' Hutchinson, 1. 452.

Yet, though compelled by dispropor tionate strength to yield, the other colonies were not inac tive, but sent agents to England for aid ; Cromwell ordered three ships to be despatched to assist in the reduction of the Dutch ; and Massachusetts was recommended to join in the enterprise. Immediately, the Court was convened, and permission was given to Major Robert Sedgwick, and Capt. John Leverett, who had been commissioned for that purpose by Cromwell, to raise five hundred volunteers, provided \" the persons might be free from lawful engagements.\" But before the expedition could set out, news arrived that a peace had been concluded with Holland, and bloodshed was prevented. ' The troops which had been raised, there fore, instead of being employed against Manhattan, were sent to dislodge the French from Penobscot and St. Johns, of which, for many years, they had held possession ; and without much resistance that object was accomplished. 2 The peace with the Dutch, and the \" hopeful establishment of government in England,\" led to an order for a general thanksgiving, which was celebrated throughout the colony with the customary rejoicing. 3 Pending the disputes with the Dutch, new Indian diffi culties arose, with the Narraganset tribe, who attacked the Indians at Long Island, under the protection of the English. This act, with the conspiracy of Ninigret, was thought to be sufficient ground for a war ; and a resolution was passed, that two hundred and fifty men should be raised in the several colonies for that purpose ; but Massachusetts, still stubborn, refused to raise her quota. For over a year these hostilities continued ; and many \" upland Indians \" being collected together, a messenger was sent to Ninigret, who 1 Mass. Rec's., 3. 311-16, 323-9; Hutchinson, 1. 169; 4 M.

Secure in the protection which Cromwell extended to them, sympathizing heartily with the success of the Common wealth, and anxious for the diffusion of the blessings of the gospel, the Puritans of Massachusetts directed their ener gies to strengthen the churches which had sprung up amongst them, and to foster the interests of religion and learning.

In a government so popular as was ours at that time, no course subversive of the welfare of all could be adopted, without awakening jealousy and mistrust.

The Charter itself takes notice of this purpose ; it is alluded to in the earlier letters of the Company ; and, although several years elapsed before much was accom plished, and the Indians, as well as others, inquired into the causes of this neglect, the difficulties to be encountered in acquiring the language of the country, the struggles of the emigrants for the means of subsistence, the annoyances to which they were exposed at home and abroad, and the care which their own churches required, in the infancy of their settlement, may be urged in palliation of this neglect, if indeed it requires an apology ; and the candid will doubt less acknowledge that, under such circumstances, much could not be expected, nor could much be attained. But, when the severity of their earliest trials was over, and they were at liberty to look around them, to attempt the conversion of these \"wrecks of humanity,\" and to win them to industrious habits, and the arts of civilized life, there was no reluctance to engage in the work, nor were there wanting individuals filled with the spirit which prompted them to undertake it.

The labors of Mr. Eliot, however, did not end here. Feebng the need of books of instruction, he executed the Herculean task of translating the Bible into the dialect of the Indians, and prepared catechisms, a grammar, a primer, a psalter, and translated other works highly es teemed by our Puritan fathers, all which were printed at the expense of the Society for Propagating the Gospel. Even in old age, he abated not his interest in his work ; and his last letters to the President of the Corporation, show how deeply his heart was set on spreading abroad the word of God, and placing it within the reach of the poorest of his converts. At the restoration of Charles the Second, the enemies of the Corporation endeavored its overthrow, and to divert its resources into his Majesty's coffers, or their own private purses ; but, through the intercession of its friends, among whom were conspicuous Dr. Lake, Bishop of Bath and Wells, and Robert Boyle, Esq., his Majesty was pleased to grant a new Charter, continuing several of the old members, and nominating and appointing others, of the 1 Homer, in 1 M.

The public mind was poisoned with suspi cions of the fidelity of the Indians ; and those of Natick and Marlborough, and perhaps of other places, were sent to Deer Island, where they were confined all winter, and endured great hardships. In vain did Mr. Eliot protest against this treatment ; and Gookin alone, of the magis trates, had the firmness to second his remonstrances ; but, though he thereby exposed himself to the reproaches of his associates, and the insults of the populace, he was too confirmed a patriot to show open resistance, and too ardent a friend of the Indians to allow such conduct to divert or deter him from supporting their cause.2 At the close of the war, the effects of this erroneous treatment were strikingly perceptible, for the number of 1 Morton's Mem., 132 ; 1.

Mr. Cotton, of Plymouth, was an assistant in the work ; and we learn, from his letters, and from those of Mr. Bourne, that there 1674. were, within the colony, twenty places where meetings were held ; and although but one church was gathered, having twenty-seven communicants, and but ninety persons had been baptized, there were nearly five hundred attendants on public worship.

From this pleasing picture of the efforts of our fathers for the conversion of the Indians, we must now turn to one which presents us, in contrast, some of the extreme lights and shadows which flit upon the outskirt of Nature's capa cious circle, and which, like clouds, obscure the fairest summer's landscape. As the Puritans of New England were fully persuaded of the correctness of their own reli gious opinions, and came to these shores expressly to build up a new community, from which heresy was to be carefully excluded, the advent of the Quakers was regarded with even greater abhorrence than that of the antinomians, ana baptists, and Gortonists. It was deemed \" another assault of Satan upon God's poor people here ;\" for their doctrines were condemned as \" loathsome and pernicious,\" the \" most venomous of all to the churches of America,\" opening anew that \" dead sea of hetorodoxy, that vast and horrid sink, such as makes the land to stink in the nostrils both of God and man, more than the frogs that sometime annoyed Egypt.\"1 The founders of new sects, and their earliest disciples, whose tone of thought is in a habitual state of passionate elevation, and whose aims and objects are usually idealized by the glowing atmosphere of an ardent imagination, are not infrequently characterized by a zeal highly dispropor tioned to the wisdom which is necessary to regulate and control the same ; and to this are we to impute the extrav- 1 Clap, in Chron.

The history of enthusiasm is in all ages the v^-sl, same. Rarely are zeal and moderation so happily and evenly blended in the temperament of self constituted prophets, as to lead to no excesses which are afterwards regretted. It is with sects as with individuals, age cools the impetuosity of youthful passions, and the wildest seldom fail to be sobered by its experience, and instructed by its warnings. Hence the maturity of religious bodies, is usually marked by a more grave and temperate deport ment than might have been anticipated from the sallies of their earlier years. It is not surprising, therefore, that even the Quakers, now a quiet and peaceable order of Christians \u2014 somewhat singular in their habits it is true, but none the less honest, upright, and sincere \u2014 should have been denounced as \" fanatics,\" and should have been guilty of follies, which their more staid and philosophic descendants will concur in acknowledging, must be imputed to the warmth of the neophyte rather than to the wisdom of the disciplined mind. Of the history of the Quakers prior to their appearance in New England, it is not necessary that we should speak at length. The founder of the sect, George Fox, was a native of Drayton, in Leicestershire, and was the son of Christopher Fox, a weaver by profession, and a man of such integrity that he was called by his neighbors, \" right eous Christer.\" From his earliest years, George, the son, was marked by a gravity of deportment unusual in chil dren ; at the age of eleven, he \" knew pureness and right eousness ; \" and during his apprenticeship, such was his honesty, that he \" never wronged man or woman in all that time, and it was a common saying among people, if George says verily, there is no altering him.\" J There is ' Journal, ed. 1694, pp. 2, 3. 31"], [380, "362 TREATMENT OF FOX.

Yet his own morals, however pure, did not prevent him from approving acts of his followers of questionable propriety, if not of positive indecency ; nor did the fervency of his piety, however vital, pre serve him from the insidious, because imperceptible delu sions, to which imaginative and melancholic minds are so often subject.1 But \" dogwhips and horsewhips,\" \" staves, clods, and stones,\" \" mauling with the Bible until the blood gushed from his face,\" and thrusting into dungeons reeking with filth, were not Christian weapons of conversion, however striking ; and the fearlessness with which he rebuked sin ; the doctrines of peace which he advocated so consistently ; the persistence with which he sought to reform the morals of the people ; the personal honesty of himself and his followers ; his protests against the practice of robbing the shipwrecked ; and his uniform integrity, straight-forward ness, and frankness, are qualities which commendably dis tinguish him from his opposers, and which may cause us to cast the mantle of charity over the errors of his judg ment, or the excesses of his zeal. Quakerism, without doubt, had a mission to perform in the world, or it would never have appeared ; and though it is easy to echo the popular cry of heresy, errors of the head may be much more excusable and far less dangerous than errors of the heart, though the latter are more often winked at and 1 Journal, 24, 54, 55, 56, 59, 103, 146-7, 239."], [381, "MARY FISHER AND ANN AUSTIN. 363 applauded, than the former are tolerated, and treated with chap lenity.1 \u2022 J!^ XIII.

These were all imprisoned, deprived of the books which they had brought to circulate, and treated, in some cases, with great indignity ; and, as it was feared there was danger of the spread of their opinions, even from prison, they were ban ished without ceremony, and the masters of the vessels which had brought them hither, were placed under bonds to take them away.3 At the next session of the General Court, a penalty of Oct. 14 \u00a3100, was imposed upon the master of any ship bringing Quakers within the jurisdiction ; and all brought in, were to be sent to jail, whipped twenty stripes, and kept at work until transported. Letters were also written to the Commissioners of the colonies, recommending the passage of laws for the suppression of this sect, and the banishment of its members.4 In the following year, a fine of forty shillings was imposed upon any one harboring Quakers in their dwellings, for \" every hour's entertainment and concealment ; \" and at a still later date, all encouraging or M\u00aby, defending them were to be fined ten shillings, and the speakers in their meetings were to forfeit five pounds.

Not only were the worthiest imprisoned for pitying them, but large numbers of the Quakers themselves, delicate women, with infants at their breasts, children, whose youth should have protected them from harm, and the aged, whose years should have excited compassion, were alike scourged, imprisoned, and fined: \u2014 nay, some were sent off, and sold into slavery ! 2 Appeals to England were treated with contempt ; and Endicott, Wilson, Norton, and others, urged on the work of persecution, until a resilience was produced, \u2014 until the people recoiled from the scene of blood ; with loathing and abhorrence, repented of their misdeeds ; and clamored for the repeal of the most bar- 1 Bishop, 157-8, 168-76; Cod- dington's Demonstration, 9. 2 \" Your cruelties,\" says Codding- ton, Demonst., 7, \" have filled the contents of two printed treatises hitherto, which is the world's won der, and the astonishment of all that are men of ingenuity and tender ness.\""], [385, "APOLOGIES OF THE COLONISTS. 367 barous statutes.

Such extravagances, if noticed at all, should have been treated with the mild discipline of a luna tic asylum, rather than met by a fanaticism equally repre hensible, and equally abhorrent to the sensitive mind.1 Yet it was the doctrine of those days, and openly avowed, that \" the very light of nature teacheth all nations, that madmen, acting according to their frantick passions, are to be restrained with chains, when they cannot be restrained otherwise. \" 2 Four victims the scaffold claimed, before the tide of per secution ebbed.

Upon his own trial he demanded, by what law they condemned him ? When it was anwered, \" our own \" \u2014 \" Who empowered you to make that law? \" was his immediate inquiry. And when the patent was pleaded, \" can you make laws,\" he asked, \" against those of England ? \" None but a negative reply could be re turned. \" Then,\" added he, \" have you overstepped your bounds, and your hearts are as rotten towards the King as towards God.\" It was useless to continue the controversy, and a verdict of guilty was promptly pronounced. \" I deny all guilt,\" was the fearless rejoinder : \" My conscience is clean in the sight of God.\" When the sentence of death was passed, \"What do you gain,\" he exclaimed, \" by taking Quakers' lives ? For the last man you put to death, here are five come in his room ; and if ye have power to take my life, God can raise up ten in my stead.\" x Intelligence of the proceedings of the colonists soon reached England; and Edward Burroughs, waiting upon his Majesty, Charles the Second, who had recently been restored to the throne of his father, said : \" There is a vein of blood opened in your dominions which, if not stopped, will overcome all.\" \" I will stop that vein,\" was the prompt reply. \"Then do it speedily,\" said the ally of Fox, \" for we know not how soon many may be put to death.\" \" As speedily as ye will,\" was the answer of his Majesty ; \" call to the Secretary, and I will do it presently.\" The Secretary was called ; a mandamus was granted ; and per mission was given the Quakers to forward it by whom they pleased.

The Deputy Governor was sought, and a consultation was held ; and the laconic reply was : \" We shall obey his Majesty's command.\" Liberty was given the passengers to land ; a number of \" Friends \" were released from prison ; and there was a general re-union and rejoicing among them. 2 The compliance of the Magistrates with the Mandamus of the King was reluctantly given ; and policy alone prob ably induced consent.

Two at least were whipped through the streets, and driven into the wilderness ; two were remanded to prison ; and two, who had been once banished, were whipped at the cart's tail in three several towns.

The messengers were alarmed ; but the Quakers were lenient, and they escaped uninjured. J From this date the rigor of the colonial laws abated ; and, though disturbances continued for upwards of twenty years, and large sums of money were extorted, and a vast amount of suffering endured in the earlier stages of their persecution, as their own conduct became more tractable, and as they became sensible of the folly of their former course, and sobered down into quiet and peaceable citizens, they were suffered to remain in the colony without special molestation ; though never, under the Charter government, were they treated with mildness. We have no disposition to exonerate the Puritans of Massachusetts from blame in their treatment of the Quakers. Forgetting that them selves were \"judged in their judgment, and executed in their execution,\" they allowed their horror of heresy to transport them beyond the bounds both of reason and jus tice ; and the irregular and tumultuous modes of redress which they unhappily adopted, seriously reflect upon their moderation and prudence. The principles of toleration, however, were but little understood at that time, and only to a slight extent had they gained ground over blind bigotry.

There was doubtless enough superstition in the creed of the colonists ; and if we have outgrown the same, let us be thankful for it. But let us not censure too harshly the conduct of men to whom we are so largely indebted for the blessings we enjoy. We would, so far as possible, cast over their errors the mantle of charity.

The return of the Stuarts to the English throne was not chap. XIV altogether unexpected in the colonies. The events of the \u25a0^~r~J last three years had satisfied the people that the Common- 1660' wealth was losing ground ; and the incompetency of Richard Cromwell, who was never proclaimed Protector here, J awakened apprehensions of the defeat of the new govern ment, and the restoration of the old. That this result was not fervently prayed for, we may reasonably believe. Yet if dreaded, it was principally because it was feared there would be a change in the government, and the Puritans would be compelled to abate their exclusiveness. Despite of all efforts to prevent innovations in religion, many not friendly to the Puritan creed had succeeded in gaining admittance into the country ; the leaven of their opinions, which persecution could not destroy, was rapidly spread ing; and among the masses, if not among their rulers, there was a restlessness under the intolerance which had hitherto prevailed, and a desire to extend the privileges of citizen ship, by breaking down the barriers reared against dissent, and admitting to the exercise of the elective franchise all of good character and peaceable deportment. The progress of nations as of individuals, is governed by fixed and determinate laws. Not consciously, perhaps, do we work out at all times the problems of our destiny. The motives of actions are often more circumscribed than 'Hutchinson, 1. 193, note; Hubbard, 576; Chalmers, Ann., 249. 32"], [392, "374 THE RESTORATION. chap, the results which attend them. A few, here and there, are Jrv^ moved by an inward and mysterious impulse to throw off conventional restraints, and to act on a broader plane. Their course is resisted by the dominant powers. Yet the issue is generally the progress of truth. The position of the English Church, in the earliest stage of its reformation, was a step in advance of the Church of Rome. It made a Pope for each country, instead of one Pope for the world. Puritanism was an advance upon the position of the Angli can Church, as it claimed for each man individual rights. The fruits of this last principle could not instantly mature. But a partial development immediately followed. A more perfect unfolding time only could effect. And America was the destined field of their highest expansion. Here, out- wardly, everything was favorable to liberty ; and inwardly, there was a desire to secure and enjoy it. The ground already travelled has brought to notice some struggles for the advancement of freedom. Apparently but little change had hitherto been wrought. But the con troversies which had so deeply agitated the people, stirred up the waters preparatory to their purification and life giving efficacy. Puritanism, indeed, was still groping darkly along. Its mission was not accomplished. Its pol icy was a policy adapted to its circumstances, but not com prehensive enough for the world at the present day. Yet even in the infancy of a nation, the germs of its riper years are often perceptible. The seed was of the right sort sown by our fathers, and if some tares were mixed with it, in what field are none found? That seed was watched over, and rapidly grew. Priests planted, and rulers watered ; but the Majesty of Heaven alone gave the increase. On the theater of the world, no movement is isolated. Changes in one country produce changes in another. All nations are alike actors in the great drama of life. If"], [393, "PROCLAMATION of the king. 375 monarchy was for a season abolished in England, princes chap. xiv were admonished to beware of its abuses. If the Common- w-y-^ wealth failed, because it was premature, subjects were taught to deserve freedom before demanding it. To Amer ica both revolutions were pregnant with instruction. And .now that monarchy was restored, we shall find the new order of things fraught with its lessons of wisdom ; and the consequences resulting were as important to the mother country, as to her several dependencies. The proclamation in England of Charles the Second, May 26, took place in May, and in July the tidings were received juiy 27 in Massachusetts by the ships which brought the regicides Goffe and Whalley ; but no notice was publicly taken of the event, nor was any change made in the forms of the public acts and proceedings.1 If the declaration from Breda arrived at the same time, it was probably regarded April. with suspicion and mistrust.2 At the October Court, a Oct. 19? motion for an address to the King was negatived. It was time enough to recognize his authority when it became per manent. Rumor represented England as still in an unset tled state, and until different intelligence was received, delay was deemed prudent, nor could it be construed into neglect. At length the government was certified of the Nov- 30. proceedings of Parliament, and was informed that its enemies had revived, and that his Majesty's Council was besieged with their complaints. Delay was no longer prudent ; the position of the colonies must be openly defined. Hence a Court was convened, and addresses Dec. 19. were prepared for the King and the Parliament.3 The style of these addresses has been censured as fulsome.4 The agency of the clergy in their preparation is apparent ; but, with the exception of hyperboles drawn from the Old 'Hutchinson, 1. 194; Chalmers, Ann., 250. * Hallam, Const.

The government has power to determine what officers are necessary, and to define their duties ; it has full authority, both legisla tive and executive, ecclesiastical and civil, over residents and strangers ; and that without appeals, except where its laws are palpably repugnant to the known laws of England. It is likewise its privilege forcibly to defend itself, by land and by sea, against all attempting its destruction or annoy ance. And any imposition prejudicial to the country, and contrary to its own laws, is declared an infringement of its vested rights. Its duties of allegiance are, To maintain the right of the King to the country, and not to subject it to any other potentate ; to preserve his person, and pre vent conspiracies; to seek his peace, and discharge with fidelity the duties committed to them ; to punish crimes against his crown and dignity ; and to propagate the gos pel \" according to the faith given by our Lord Jesus Christ in his word:\" \u2014 and these things premised, it is claimed to be consistent with the loyalty and obedience of subjects thus privileged, to plead with their prince against all en deavoring to violate their rights.1 Of a people holding such opinions, the advocates of high prerogative might well be jealous.

And so long as their patent was preserved to them inviolate, and they were left unmolested, and the rights it conferred were not infringed or interfered with, so long were they obedient and peaceable subjects. They interpreted their charter favorably on their own be half, and it was stipulated in the instrument itself that it should be so construed ; but their interpretation was not always consonant to the wishes of the parent state ; and hence the struggle, on the one hand to retain, and on the other to restrain, the powers and privileges which were claimed and exercised.

The friends of toleration had for several years been gaining ground ; and a strong party was springing up, which promised soon to become more conspicuous, and to work a marked revolution in the policy and the destiny of the country. But the exclusive spirit which had hitherto pre vailed in the colonial councils, and which was necessary, in a measure, under the circumstances in which the people were placed, was now at its height. Its mission was not ended. There was more work for it to do while the inter ests of the country were jeopardized ; nor could it have been safely dispensed with, perhaps, until the relations of the colonies to the mother country became better under stood, and a reciprocity of interests was established, which relieved the former of their fears for their own safety, and the permanence of the settlements which had been effected at such cost. The directions of his Majesty were not carried into imme diate effect. His letter was made public, and writs and processes were ordered to be issued in his name. A com mittee was also appointed to consider what further should be done, and report at the next session ; and liberty was given the \"elders\" and the \"freemen,\" and even \"any other inhabitants,\" to send in their thoughts, so that, after 1 Hutchinson, vol. 1 ; Moore's Governors, 383-4."], [403, "RENEWED DIFFICULTIES WITH ENGLAND. 385 due consultation, something might be concluded \" satisfac- chap \u25a0 XIV tory and safe, conducing to the glory of God, and the felicity of his people.\"1 At the same time, a censorship 1662' over the press was established, lest dissensions should be increased ; 2 and the government became more vigilant than ever in strengthening itself for the struggle it was destined to encounter.

It was too serious a time for political gasconade, and the speeches of the deputies were brief and laconic. \" Let some way be propounded,\" said the intrepid Bellingham, \" that the offence which the King has conceived may come to a legal issue.\" \" Process in courts of law,\" suggested the moder ate Bradstreet, \" cannot reach us in ordinary course ; yet the prerogative of the King gives him power to command our appearance, and we are bound to obey.\" \" The King's demands pass everywhere,\" cried Dudley : \" You may have a legal trial if you desire, and you may insist upon and claim it.\" \" But,\" urged Willoughby, \" does not God call us to argue one way as well as another?

Before the desolations of the plague, they could muster, probably, five thousand war riors, and numbered, in all, about eighteen thousand souls. Under the government of Canonicus and Miantonomo, and Ninigret, the sachem of Niantick, a member of the same tribe, some difficulties had arisen with them, and they had strenuously resisted all efforts for their conversion from the religion of their fathers ; but now, under Pessacus and Ninigret, they were but the wreck of their former great ness, and the different tribes within their jurisdiction num bered about two thousand warriors, and seven thousand souls. l The Wampanoags had also resisted all attempts to convert them to Christianity, though under Massasoit and Alexander they continued in friendship with the Eng lish, and the league of 1621, was kept inviolable. They were now governed by Philip, whose residence was at Mount Hope, and who was able to muster about seven hun dred warriors. 2 The dealings of the colonists with the Indians has long been a subject of vague reproach. Their treatment of the red race has been censured as cruel and barbarous ; and the conduct of Penn has been alluded to in contrast.

Nor were the magistrates or the people a signally barbarous and blood-thirsty race. Their situation was at once both critical and perplexing. They had no disposition to injure the natives, or to treat them with harshness. They purchased of them the lands they occupied, and never, save in one instance \u2014 during the Pequot War \u2014 forcibly possessed themselves of a single foot of ground. 1 Yet, when barbarism and civilization are brought into contact, one or the other must eventually yield. And especially, when the war-like spirit of the savages of New England is considered in connection with the sternness of the Puritan temper, it is evident that two races so essentially different could not long co-exist without frequent collisions. It is not, however, our purpose to apologize for our fathers. They need no apology. We admit that they erred, judged by our standard, and by the light of the present age ; but compared with their contem poraries, in the Old World or the New, their conduct was as consistent, and their characters were as pure. From the moment of the landing of the English on these shores, the doom of the Indian seems to have been sealed. Unaccustomed to the habits of civilized life, everything he saw was strange and surprising. He felt that the new comers were vastly his superiors ; and, as the population increased, and new towns were settled, and his hunting grounds were occupied for purposes of cultivation, although he had alienated these tracts under his own hand and seal, he felt painfully the contrast with the time when all was his own, and he roamed unchecked over the fairest regions, and pursued unmolested the chase of the deer.

The rude bow and arrow, once his principal weapons, had been exchanged for the musket of the white man ; and in the use of this weapon he had acquired such skill as to be a formidable antagonist, and flattered himself that he was able, with the assistance of his neighbors, to drive before him as the winds the leaves of the autumnal forests, those who had become to him objects of hatred and deadly revenge. The leading warriors of the different tribes were wise enough to see that there was danger of their own^ extermination, unless the pale-face was expelled from the country ; and Philip of Mount Hope was the first to awaken to a sense of this danger, and the first to propose an alliance to prevent it. It was in 1670-1, that suspicions of the intentions of Philip began to be excited ; and, by the frequent gathering of his tribe, repairing their arms, grinding their hatchets, and insulting the English, he was conceived to be med itating a general war. Eight years previous, he had prom ised, at Plymouth, to continue in friendship with the Eng lish, and to remain faithful to the King and the colony.1 These professions were believed ; but now it was rumored that he was about to violate them. Restless under restraints which had long been imposed upon him, it needed but little to goad him to action ; and, as he was careless in his own carriage, his conduct was imitated by others of inferior rank, and several murders were wantonly committed.2 The people of Plymouth were aroused by these abuses ; and, sending to Philip to demand redress, they invoked aid from Massachusetts to reduce him to submission. The mag istrates of the latter colony, anxious to prevent hostilities, despatched messengers to mediate between the contending parties ; and a meeting for that purpose was held at Taun ton. The interview took place in the church of the vil- ' Morton's Mem., 160-1; Hub- 2 Hubbard's Narr., 7 ; N. E. Gen. bard's Narr., 10; Hutchinson, 1. 253.

On the one side were the English, clad in the distinguishing garb of their 1670'1' day, with solemn faces and close shorn hair ; and on the other were the Indians, in the loose dress of their country, adorned with wampum, and all the finery in which savages delight, with their long black hair hanging down their backs, and their small sunken eyes gleaming like coals. Philip promptly denied harboring hostile intentions ; but when questioned as to the object of his warlike preparations, he endeavored to represent them as designed for defense against the Narragansets. The Commissioners, who knew upon what terms he stood with that tribe, and who were satisfied that the supplies he had obtained, of arms and ammunition, were designed for an attack upon Taunton and other villages, charged him with this purpose, and with such effect, that in his confusion he acknowledged all, and signed a paper renewing his covenant with his \" ancient Apr. 10, friends,\" and freely engaging to resign to the government of Plymouth all his English arms as pledges of his fidelity.1 A bond obtained under such circumstances was not worth the paper upon which it was written, and, when Philip was at liberty, he spurned his engagement ; no more arms were delivered up ; and he refused to appear at Plymouth when May 27, summoned.

After some delay this advice was accepted ; the mediators met, and matters seemed fully accommodated. Philip, the \"pec- cant offending party,\" signed a second paper, acknowledging his subjection to the king of England and the government of Plymouth, and promised to pay .\u00a3100 tribute in three years, if able, and five wolves heads annually, if he could obtain them ; to abstain from war without consent ; and in case of future difficulties to endeavor to rectify the same, and to dispose of his lands only with the consent of the colonial government.2 From this pacification, for three years, no special dis turbance occurred, and the colonists flattered themselves that the designs of the savage monarch were wholly aban doned. But this calm was deceitful ; for, while everything was apparently quiet, Philip was maturing his plans, rallying his forces, and preparing for war. The reality of this plot we are aware has been doubted ; but the proofs of its existence we do not feel at liberty wholly to reject.3 Its execution was fixed for the spring of 1676 ; but, as some say, by the rashness of Philip's young men, and against his own judgment and that of his counsellors, it was precipi tated a year earlier, and so suddenly that, when the first blood was shed, the chieftain of Mount Hope is reported to have wept ; and \" many of the Indians were in a maze, ' 1 M.

Immediate inquiries were made for the perpetrators of the deed ; and upon the representation of an Indian who had witnessed the murder, three of Philip's men were seized, taken to Plymouth, tried by a jury, part of whom were Indians, condemned and executed.5 Both pending, and after this trial, letters were received from Mr. Brown, of Swanzey, and others, stating thatjun. n Philip's warriors were in arms ; that messengers from dif ferent tribes had met at Mount Hope, and joined in the war dance ; that the young men were \" much set against the English ; \" and that their families had been sent to the Nar ragansets for protection ;6 but the only notice taken of these rumors, was to forbid the loan of arms to the natives, 'Hubbard, 14; Callender, in 4 R.

As the troops from Boston marched on to Woodcock's, an eclipse of the moon occurred ; and imagination painted distinctly upon its obscured disc an Indian scalp.2 Others had seen the form of an Indian bow in the clouds.3 And others remem bered that some years before, in a still, clear day, the report of a gun had been heard in the air, followed by a volley of musketry, and the noise of bullets whistling over their heads ; and that troops of horses had been heard coursing in the sky.4 Upon such \" prodigies \" great stress was laid ; and it would probably have been deemed blas phemy to have suggested, that these sounds were but the sighing of the winds, or the howling of wolves, or perhaps some electrical phenomena equally natural. Yet there were actual dangers encompassing their path.

The attempt was a failure, and the more unfor- 1675' tunate, because, as they afterwards learned, Philip was in such distress that, had they followed him half an hour longer, he would have been compelled to surrender, and the war would have ended.1 The tactics of the English were now changed ; and a garrison being left at Mount Hope, a fort was built and manned at Pocasset ; and with a few troops concentrated upon the most exposed places, the rest, after the departure of the Massachusetts troops, save those under Capt.

Yet the friend ship of the former was wavering. Their young men were ripe for war ; the emissaries of Philip were among them ; the chieftain himself was hastening to them for succor ; and to prevent an alliance, an agent was despatched to negotiate a treaty at Quaboag, now Brookfield.4 Capt. Hutchinson, of Boston, was the person chosen to effect this treaty ; Capt. Wheeler, of Concord, with a few of his troops were to join him ; and three Praying Indians served as guides. Marching from Cambridge to Sudbury, and thence into the Nipmuck country, they arrived at 'Military Papers, 1. 229-31; Hubbard, 27-8; Baylies, 3. 54; Bliss, 87 ; Drake's Indians, B. 3. 28. 2 Winslow, MSS., before quoted ; 1 M.

Thither the Aug. 2. troops marched, accompanied by a few from Brookfield ; but finding no Indians, the company kept on, and at the distance of four or five miles, at a place called Momini misset, where on one side a high hill arose almost perpen dicularly from the road, and the other was skirted by a hideous swamp, they were attacked by two or three hun dred savages, eight were killed, and Capts. Hutchinson and Wheeler, and three others were wounded. The son of Capt. Wheeler was one of the wounded ; but instantly dismounting, and placing his father upon his own horse, and seizing another, whose rider had been slain, the party escaped to the town, which they had scarcely entered when it was fired in different places, and all the houses were con sumed, save a few outbuildings, reserved by the Indians for shelter, and one principal building, to which the inhabitants and the soldiers fled for safety. This building was besieged ; and for two days the Indi ans poured in upon its seventy occupants an incessant vol ley of musketry. Twice a large heap of combustibles was piled against it ; but the flames were extinguished by extra ordinary efforts. Pieces of cloth, dipped in sulphur, were fastened to arrow heads, and shot at the roof, to set it on fire. Foiled in these attempts, a cart filled with burning flax, hay, and other materials, was pushed up to the walls ; but this too, it is said, was quenched by a shower of rain. The scene was terrific.

XV. 1675, Aug. 3. Aug. 5. Aug 30, quailed. No quarter was offered : no quarter was asked. The besieged and the besiegers were equally resolute ; and against fearful odds the former held out. At this critical juncture, when escape seemed hopeless, timely relief fortunately arrived. Two messengers had been sent to Boston for aid ; one only escaped, and on arriving at Marlborough met Maj. Willard, and Capt. Par ker, of Groton, who, with forty-six men, and five Indians, had been ordered to scout in the neighboring towns. In formed of the sufferings of the people at Brookfield, they hastened to their aid ; and late on the evening of the 4th, reached the village just in season to save the survivors. The engagement continued through most of that night ; and towards morning, the Indians, having burnt their shelters, retreated with the loss of about eighty, killed and wounded ; and in a swamp a few miles distant, were joined by Philip with the remnant of his tribe, both sannops and squaws. l The Indians upon the Connecticut next entered the field; prowling about Hadley, Hatfield, and Deerfield; and though the tribes at the North-east, bordering upon New Hamp shire, took no part in the war at this time, before the end of August the whole Massachusetts colony was involved in as great danger as that to which Plymouth had been pre viously exposed. Even the Praying Indians were suspected ; and orders were passed to restrain them from hunting, or from travelling, save in the company of the English ; and some, of whom the greatest fears were entertained, were confined as prisoners for the public security. A portion of the Praying Indians actually joined Philip ; but the larger part were faithful, and many were of signal service as allies and spies.

Maj. Willard and Capt. Lathrop were quartered there ; and the Nipmucks, and Philip's Indians, being gradually driven back, lurked in that wide extent of forest which bordered the river from Hadley to Northfield ; and, hanging upon the skirts of the English villages \" like lightning on the edge of the clouds,\" they came down upon them like the rush of a whirlwind, and their track was marked with as signal desolation. The settlements in those parts were not very numerous. Long Meadow, upon the East bank, adjoined the Con necticut Colony ; and further to the North stood Springfield, where Pynchon resided. Hatfield had but few families ; and Northfield, or Squaheag, was also a feeble place. At Westficld, on the West bank, a slight village had sprung up ; Northampton was in its infancy ; at Hadley there was a more numerous population ; and at the foot of the hill where the broad meadows and fertile intervales of Petum tuck stretch out between the Deerfield and the Connecti cut, \u2014 the Canaan of the valley, environed with delightful mountain scenery, \u2014 a few buildings might be seen, which had grown up as by magic within a decade of years. West of these towns, the outposts of civilization, an almost unbroken wilderness extended to the banks of the Hudson. Not a town in Berkshire county had been incorporated. The Indians in this region had, for so many years, pre served an uninterrupted peace with the English, that no doubts were at first entertained of their fidelity.

Sept. 1 friendship of the races had been strengthened by long inter course, and reciprocal kindness. There was land enough for all ; the bounties of nature were sufficient for all ; and why should they contend, when they had all they required ? Yet treachery lurked there notwithstanding this calm ; and though the Hadley tribe volunteered their aid to fight against Philip, it was soon discovered that they were more ready to betray than to assist the English. The Mohegans were the first to disclose their deceit ; and, when required to surrender their arms, they abandoned their fort, and fled to the camp of the chieftain of Mount Hope. Pursued by a company under Capts. Lathrop and Beers, an engagement ensued near Sugar Loaf Hill, in which the English lost nine men, and the Indians twenty-six.1 A week later, on a fast day, Hatfield was attacked, and in imminent danger of being destroyed ; but in the midst of the contest, while the war-whoop was ringing, and just as the Indians were about to triumph, a venerable figure, of commanding aspect, clad in the fashion of a former generation, with his hair white from age, suddenly ap peared, and with sword in hand rallied the disordered troops, infused into them fresh courage, and placing himself at their head, the savages were speedily compelled to retire. At the close of the struggle, the visitor vanished as myste riously as he came ; the belief was long cherished that an angel had relieved the town ; and years elapsed before it was known that Col. Goffe, who had been a commander in the army of Cromwell's Invincibles, and who was then con cealed in Hadley, was the one to whom they were indebted for so timely a deliverance.2 The same day Deerfield was 1 Military Papers, 2. 33 ; Hub- bard, 36-7 ; Mather; Drake's Indi- ans, B. 3. 21; Baylies, 3. 66-7, &c.

The gallant Capt, Beers had been sent to the relief of this place ; but at Sept. some distance from the town he was ambushed, and twenty ie734' of his men, with himself at their head, were slain.1 The commissioners of the United Colonies were by this time convened ; a narrative from Plymouth was presented ; sept. 9. the rise of the war, on the part of that colony, was declared to be defensive ; and its vigorous prosecution was adjudged to be necessary, and to be carried on jointly by all the colo nies, according to the Articles of Confederation.2 Yet before troops were levied, further depredations were com mitted, and a second battle was fought at Deerfield, far s lg more sanguinary than the first. Capt. Lothrop, of Beverly, had been sent thither with eighty picked men, the \" flower of Essex,\" carefully culled, to serve as a convoy to the teams which were bringing down the harvest of the settle ments to be deposited at Hadley ; and, while marching easily along, unsuspicious of danger, he was suddenly assailed by the invisible enemy at Sugar Loaf Hill, and, after maintaining for several hours an unequal contest, before Capt. Moseley or Maj. Treat could arrive with succor he was totally defeated, with the loss of the greater part of his own men, and a number from Deerfield. This was the severest loss which the English sustained ; and the mur muring brook which winds peacefully through the thriving village, bears to this day a name which commemorates the terrible massacre.3 To Springfield the attention of the Indians was next directed.

But now that North - field and Deerfield had fallen into his hands, and their hostages had escaped, they secretly admitted three hundred of Philip's warriors into their fort at Long Hill, in the night, and a plan was concerted for the destruction of the village. Happily, the plot was discovered in season to pre- vent its entire accomplishment ; and the inhabitants had barely escaped to their garrisons for security, when the whole body of the savages came pouring like a torrent upon the place, and burnt the deserted houses and barns, to the number of upwards of fifty buildings, including that of the minister ; but, by the timely arrival of Maj. Treat, with the Connecticut forces, Maj. Pynchon, who was at Hadley, and Capt. Appleton, they were prevented from doing further mischief, and withdrew.1 Securing what property was left undestroyed, Maj. Pyn chon remained at Springfield; and Capt. Appleton and the rest of the troops returned to Hadley ; when the Indians, flushed with success, fell upon Hatfield ; but Capts. Moseley and Pool were quartered there ; Maj. Treat was at Northampton, not far distant ; and Capt. Appleton was at Hadley, which lay nearly opposite ; and with such commanders to contend with, how could Philip look for victory ? The attack was fatal to his hopes ; and though a few of the English were slain, the invaders, some seven or eight hundred in number, after having burned a few buildings, were signally repulsed.2 This defeat was the greatest which the Indians had sus tained ; and, as winter was approaching, the savage chief tains prudently withdrew to the fastnesses of the swamps, until the warmth of spring warranted a renewal of hostil ities. A few straggling parties skulked about Northampton, Westfield, and Springfield, for several weeks; but their depredations were trifling.

CHAP. XV. 1675. Oct. 18. In Massachusetts and Connecticut, similar diligence was displayed. In the former colony, the forces were divided into six companies, under Appleton, Moseley, Gardiner, Davenport, Oliver, and Johnson ; and those of Connecticut were divided into five companies, under Major Treat, and Capts. Seeley, Gallop, Mason, Watts, and Marshall. The command of the whole was entrusted to Governor Winslow, of Plymouth, one of the most able and efficient officers in the country, as well as an accomplished gentleman and a delightful companion, whose singular coolness, intrepidity, and prudence, peculiarly qualified him for so important a trust.1 At this stage of their proceedings, another attempt was made to negotiate with the Narragansets ; and several of the principal chiefs appearing at Boston, the league of the previous July was renewed, and they agreed to deliver up, within ten days, every hostile Indian in their borders, into the hands of the English.2 Had this agreement been fulfilled, future hostilities would doubtless have been pre vented ; but the Narragansets, regardless of their promises, continued to procrastinate, and the Engbsh were convinced that their real object was to gain time. The power of this tribe was still formidable ; and the colonists were aware that, if really hostile, by a junction with Philip all detached settlements would fall into their hands, and the existence of the larger towns would also be jeopardized. Con necticut foresaw this danger, and at once adopted stern and vigorous measures of defense. The military regulations of her General Court are embodied in terms of anxious solem nity.

It was a time of the deepest gloom and anxiety. The perils of a winter campaign were clearly foreseen ; but the perils of delay were conceived to be greater. No alternative was left therefore but to act ; and the decision of the Commissioners was prompt and earnest. It was resolved to anticipate the intentions of the Narra gansets, by attacking them in their own lairs ; a declaration of the causes of the war was drawn up and signed ; and the necessary measures to ensure success were adopted. The forces from Connecticut were directed to rendezvous at Norwich, Stonington, and New London ; those from Massachusetts and Plymouth, at Rehoboth, Providence, and Warwick ; General Winslow was to assume his command on the 10th of December ; and a \" meet number of able ministers and chirurgeons \" were provided for the army.2 One more step remained to be taken ; and it was recom mended to the several courts to appoint the 2d of Decem ber \"to be observed and kept as a solemn day of prayer and humiliation, to supplicate the Lord's pardoning mercy and compassion towards his poor people, and for success in the endeavors for the repelling the rage of the enemy.\" This recommendation was adopted ; the day of humiliation was observed ; fervent prayers were offered at every shrine ; and the people of the colonies, committing them- 1 Military Papers, 1. 298; Trum- bull, 1. 336; Baylies, 3. 85; Hist.

On the 8th of December, the Massachusetts troops, under ' Maj. Appleton, numbering four hundred and sixty-five foot, and a company of seventy-five horse, under Capt.

The skirmishes on the route, and those of the four following days, were a prelude to the general attack. The taking- of Bull's , garrison by the Dec. 16.

The opening to which this led was commanded in front by a log house, and on the left by a flanker ; but as it was the only part of the enclosure accessible, and as the log could be surmounted without much difficulty, the attempt was made by a part of the Massachusetts troops, led by Capt. Johnson. This officer, unfortunately, was killed at the first fire from the enemy ; Capt. Davenport, who followed him, met with a similar fate ; and a large number of soldiers being wounded or slain by the galling shot of the enemy, the rest retreated from the enclosure, and throwing themselves upon their faces, the bullets passed over them like a shower of hail.

Philip's War, and its consequences were greater than were < \u2014^ at first anticipated. The enmity of that tribe was now 167\u00b0' implacable; their alliance with Philip was certain; and, as many had escaped, it was evident that at the opening of spring hostilities would be renewed, and that the war, on the part of the Indians, would be one of extermination. In some respects, the Indians had the advantage of the English. War, with them, was a hereditary pursuit. Living in proximity to the whites, they were intimately acquainted with the location of their dwellings, their places of resort, and their manners and customs. They knew every river, brook, swamp, road, or other peculiarity in the configuration of the country. They were constantly at hand to watch the movements of their opponents, and to attack them at difficult passes, and in unguarded moments. At the outskirts of the settlements was an unbroken wilder ness. This enabled them, in bodies or parties, to make their approach undiscovered ; and, secret as beasts of prey, skilful as marksmen, and animated with the deadliest feel ings of hate, by day and by night they crept into barns, or concealed themselves behind fences, or crouched by the roadside, or even before the doors, so that no sooner did a white man, woman or child appear, than they were instantly shot, or mortally wounded. By the rapidity of their move-"], [448, "430 RELATIVE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH AND THE INDIANS. chap, ments, they seemed omnipresent. At midnight or at noon- \u25a0 \u2014 r-L> day, they were Teady for an attack. There was no safety 167j' to any one. Asleep or awake, journeying, laboring, wor- shipping, or resting, all were in jeopardy. The exploring party was waylaid and cut off, and mangled bodies and dis jointed limbs were exposed to strike terror into the hearts of pursuers. No mercy was shown to the mother or her babe. The tomahawk and the scalping knife were seldom at rest. The stillness of the Sabbath was broken by the war-whoop ; and in passing to or returning from the house of God, or even within its walls, engaged in prayer, the demoniac yell announced their presence ; the quick flash and sharp report of their well-aimed muskets dealt indis criminate slaughter among the flock ; and the groans of the wounded, the shrieks of the helpless, and the gasp of the dying, added to the horrors of the frightful scene. But if the Indians, in these respects, had the advantage of the English, in other respects the advantage was on the side of the latter. Abundantly supplied with arms and ammunition ; having towns for their shelter, and garrisons for retreat ; united into one body for the common defense ; and possessing that recuperative energy which the savage can never enjoy, the contest was unequal, and could not but terminate fatally to the aborigines. Whatever forebodings, therefore, the ravages of the past summer may have excited, the feeling was now that the result was no longer doubtful, and though the struggle might be protracted, the final suc cess of the English was sure. The retreat from the Narraganset country was attended with incredible hardships and sufferings.

But if the condition of the English was deplorably wretched, how much more appalling must have been that of the Indians ! Driven from their wigwams, the shades of the forest were their only shelter. All their stores, \" their curiously-wrought baskets, full of corn, their famous strings of wampum,\" and their nicely lined dwellings, were consumed ; and the survivors were exposed to the horrors of famine, or left to escape to the more distant tribes. After so fierce an encounter, there was a temporary lull in the storm of war. Exhausted by the sight, both parties were willing to pause for a breathing spell ; and the In dians, who had suffered most, were in the least fit condition to renew the struggle. Yet it was not the policy of the English to give them long to rally ; the vigorous prosecu- Dec tion of the war was decreed by the Commissioners of the United Colonies,2 and troops of horsemen scoured the country, and \" brought in daily much of their corn and beans, which they had hid under the ground.\" Stragglers, wandering in quest of food, were frequently captured ; and Capt.

The Commissioners had previously ordered three hundred fresh troops to be raised and sent to the camp, and in the depth of winter they waded through the snow to join their companions.2 But neither the vigilance of the officers, nor the daring of the soldiers, could entirely prevent the depredations of the ene my ; and, as they fled into the interior, they \" despoiled Mr. Carpenter of two hundred sheep, and fifty head of neat cat tle, and fifteen horses.\" This was a timely supply.

Passing the night in the village, on the next day he prepared for a second engagement. At a short distance from the town, four or five Indians were dis covered, limping as if wounded.

A furious attack ensued ; and a fresh body of Indians appearing, the gallant band, like the Spartans at Thermopyl\u00e6, were completely surrounded, and after a brave resistance of above two hours, in which Capt.

Pierce was a prelude to that of the unfortunate Wadsworth ; and the Sudbury fight is as mem orable in the annals of the Massachusetts Colony, as is Pierce's Fight in the annals of the Plymouth Colony. It was on the morning of Friday2 that this attack commenced, when a body of Indians, said to have numbered fifteen hundred, fell upon the village, consumed several houses and barns, and killed several persons. A company from Watertown, aided by citizens of Sudbury, were the first who engaged the assailants, on the East bank of the river ; but after a severe contest they were compelled to retreat. Immediately a corps from Concord was detached, and, as they arrived near Haynes' garrison, they were ambushed, and ten of them slain, \u2014 one only escaping. Capt. Wads worth, of Milton, had just arrived at Marlborough ; and learning the danger of Sudbury, he hastened to its relief, with all his soldiers, and Capt. Brocklebanck, of Rowley.

Gookin, to march to Sudbury to watch the motions of the enemy.2 The Indians, by this time, were reduced to great suffer ing, and were forced to live upon ground nuts and horse flesh. This bred diseases, of which numbers died. Besides, their season for planting had arrived ; something must be done to provide for the future ; and their fish for winter stores must be caught now if over. The war had been pro tracted to an unusual length ; they were, unaccustomed to continue so long in a hostile position ; and their resources were rapidly and daily diminishing. Hence some of the chiefs were inclined to suspend hostilities ; and a person who was acquainted with the Indians about Lancaster adventured to treat with them, and redeemed Mrs. Row landson. Encouraged by his success, the Council sent others to second his efforts, and a number of prisoners were ransomed and returned.3 \"There are the usual discrepan- cies in the accounts of this battle, and we have endeavored to recon- 2 Mather, 27; Mass.

Learning , of his presence, Capt. Denison went in pursuit, and over- taking him near the Blackstone, fell upon his camp near the spot where Capt. Pierce had been slain. The surprise was complete. The chieftain fled, casting aside his silver- laced coat ; and, as he plunged into the river, he fell, and his gun was wet and rendered useless. This accident un- nerved him ; and one of the Pequots plunging in after him, with but a feeble resistance the sachem was seized. A youth of the English troops, Robert Stanton, was the first to approach him ; but the chieftain haughtily repelled his advances. - \" You too much child ; no understand war. Let your chief come, him I will answer.\" He was offered his life on condition of his submission ; but, \" like Attilius Regulus,\" the offer was refused. He was then sentenced to die. \" I like it well,\" was his reply, \" I shall die before my heart is soft, and before I have spoken anything unwor- thy of myself.\" Such heroism evinces a dauntless spirit ; yet the captive was taken and shot at Stonington, by the Mohegans and Pequots, and his head was cut off and sent to Hartford.

Brad ford and the troops of the Old Colony. Capt. Brattle, with his horsemen, and Capt. Moseley, with a foot company, were already on the spot. The Indians were flocking thither, and Philip, it was said, was at the head of the rem nant of his tribe, ravaging the country, and determined to sell his life as dearly as possible.

The family of Philip was taken, and his wife and his son were in the hands of the whites. The heart of the chieftain was ready to break. He had lost all worth striving for, and, instead of longer struggling against visible fate, he was prepared to offer himself upon the altar of his country. The lines were drawn closer and closer. Escape was impossible. Completely hemmed in, the chieftain was at bay. His days were numbered, and in darkness the star of his destiny was to be quenched. Bereft of his family ; be wailing the loss of his followers and friends ; deserted by his allies ; with his subjects falling around him as the leaves of the forest, the last of the Wampanoag chiefs remained almost alone. Hunted backward and forward as eagerly as ever fox, or boar, or midnight wolf was pursued by the sportsman ; compelled to flee from point to point ; he was driven at last to his lair at Mount Hope ; and, withdrawing to the spot which had cradled his infancy, and delighted his maturer years, that one worn and haggard man, with an infuriate multitude seeking his blood, sullenly awaited the doom which impended. It was welcome news to Capt. Church, that his enemy was in such straits ; and, without a moment's delay, gath ering around him his few trusty followers, he prepared to put the finishing stroke to the war. A deserter guided him to the side of the swamp whither Philip had withdrawn ; and upon a spot of upland, at its Southern end, and at the foot of the Mount which had been the throne of the chief tain, the victim awaited the approach of his pursuers.

And the ball of an Indian pierces his heart. He falls ! Philip of Mount Hope will sound the war-whoop no more ! The body of the chieftain lies stretched upon the ground, and the desolating war is brought to a close.1 Shall we publish the record, that the son of the chieftain was sold as a slave ? Shall we detail the particulars of the capture of Anawan ? The Indians never recovered from the blow. Their power was broken, and they were rapidly dispersed. They fought to the last for the land of their sires, but what could they effect against the power of the English ? The aggregate of suffering remains to be told. At least thirteen towns were wholly destroyed, and a large number of others sustained much damage. Six hundred of the colonists fell upon the battle field, and many of the sur vivors bore with them to the grave marks of their desperate and bloody encounters. There was scarcely a family in which some one had not suffered. Connecticut escaped with very little loss. Upon Massachusetts and Plymouth the principal burden fell. The whole expense of the war, including losses and disbursements, cannot be computed at less than half a million of dollars : \u2014 a large sum for those days, and as great in proportion as the cost of our national struggle for independence. More than six hundred build ings were consumed by fire. It was years before some towns recovered, and were rebuilt.2 We have no disposition to detract in the least from the merits of our fathers, or to reflect upon their conduct as unusually culpable.

It is true that \" Small slights, contempt, neglect, unmixed with hate, Make up in number what they want in weight,\" And of these, the Indians experienced enough.

Yet that is, in our estimation, a mawkish sentimentalism, which lavishes upon them the most glowing eulogiums for the purpose of tar nishing the luster of Puritanism. It should never be for gotten that they were an uncivilized race, and that their survivors yet remain such ; and all, who contrast the condi tion of this continent in the middle of the nineteenth cen tury, with its condition at the opening of the seventeenth century, will readily concede that the change which has been wrought here by the introduction of a new race, and the influence which the New World has exerted upon the Old, the lessons of political wisdom which have here been taught, the advancement which has been made in the arts and the sciences, and especially the problems of spiritual interest which have here been successfully developed, are monuments to the memory of the men who settled these wilds, sufficiently glorious, and sufficiently praiseworthy, to atone for those errors, which the history of all ages teaches us have been common to mankind, and from which no nation or people, however enlightened or intelligent, and in the enjoyment of the most brilliant and widely diffused advantages, has been wholly exempt."], [467, "CHAPTER XVII.

Hence the proposition of a \"menacing letter,\" favored by some of the Council, was opposed by those \"who better understood the peevish and touchy humor of that colony ; \" and, after several days deliberation, it was concluded that, if any paper was sent, it should be june 0. \" conciliatory.\" The representations of Cartwright, one of the old Commissioners, had, doubtless, a powerful influ- ence in leading to the adoption of this course ; for, when summoned to \" give a relation of the country,\" he drew a jun. 21. picture so alarming to the courtiers, that all thoughts of \" threatening \" the colonists were abandoned, and nothing was recommended beyond a \"letter of amnesty,\" which Juiy4. was prepared, and eventually \" agreed to be sent.\" 1 1 Evelyn, Diary, vol. 2. 38*"], [468, "450 COMMISSIONERS TO BE SENT TO THE COLONIES. chap.

It was known that the Acts of Navigation were evaded in Rhode Island, and openly contemned and violated in Con necticut; and those colonies were permitted to practice such irregularities without opposition. The determination of the King, therefore, to enforce these Acts in Massachu setts, could only spring from his arbitrary desire to cripple the commerce of that colony, the most dreaded of all. Yet, reluctant to hazard everything by a too stubborn resistance, an expedient was devised to obviate these scru ples which had arisen, and by a special Act of the colony itself, \" the said acts of navigation and trade \" were adopted as part of its own policy, and obedience to the same was strictly enjoined.1 It had been previously agreed in England that a Gov ernor should be sent over, wholly supported by his Majesty, and authorized to see that his orders were observed ; and the Lords soon after recommended Randolph to Lord Treas urer Danby as the most proper person for Collector of the Port of Boston, who was appointed and commissioned, and furnished with instructions from the Commissioners of the Customs in London ; but before entering upon the duties of his office, the question arose, how he was to be support ed? \u2014 and the High Treasurer asking how his expenses were to be defrayed, unless from the Exchequer ? \u2014 the Lords, in consideration of the difficulties which were likely to arise, suggested suspending his departure until a final resolution could be taken in the premises.2 The General Court, in one of its addresses to the King, had supplicated his Majesty that its messengers, having 1 Hutchinson, 1.; Chalmers, Ann. 2 Chalmers, Ann., 406, 441-2; Hubbard, 737; 3 M.

It was with great reluctance that this course was taken ; and the persons selected to discharge this trust evince the revolution in feeling which was fast approaching its crisis. Hitherto, the action of the magistrates had been bold and determined. The demands of the Monarch had been successfully resisted, and the government, \" constant to its old maxims of a free State, dependent on none but God,\" 2 had gone on, from step to step, manfully struggling for its vested rights, and determined not to swerve a hair's breadth from its own interpretation of the charter, unless forced by circum stances beyond its cont ol. But, as the first race of emigrants had nearly all departed, and a new generation had come upon the stage, and among the people there were many who were wearied with these incessant struggles, which ended only to be renewed ; and as the population had largely increased, and there were many, besides Episco palians, opposed to the ecclesiastical constitution of the col- 1 This remarkable document is 2 Bancroft, 2. 50. given in full in Chalmers, Ann., 443-9.

Hence, through their influence, William Stoughton and Joseph Dudley, two of their own party, the last a man of inordinate ambition, a finished courtier, and an adroit politician, were chosen to wait upon his Majesty, to attend his behests. The former, however, declined serving ; and the old party rallying, John Rich ards, a firm friend of the Charter, was chosen in his place. Thus one of the agents was as pliant as the osier ; the other was firm as the rugged oak.1 Every day it became more evident that the intention of the King was not to \" regulate \" but to recall the charter. Hence the agents were solemnly charged \" not to do, or consent to, anything that should violate or infringe the liberties and privileges \" granted by the char ter, or the government established thereby ; and with these May 31. instructions they departed, followed by the prayers of the Jun. 22. people for the success of their mission. Randolph, how- ever, ever active, and attentive to the interests of his employers, not only forwarded a letter acquainting them with the \" servility \" of Dudley, and the \" factiousness \" of Richards, but he determined personally to follow the agents, to be in readiness to disclose anything which they might desire to conceal. According to his own statement, he was requested, at his departure, to do nothing to the 1 Hutchinson, 1; Chalmers, Ann., 412. Their letter of recommenda- tion to Sir Lionel Jenkins, is given in 4 M.

Pre tending great friendship to the colony, and promising to represent its loyalty in the most favorable light, he advised that their agents should be authorized to wait upon Lord Hyde, and tender him an acknowledgment of X2000 for his Majesty's private service. It was well known that in the English Court everything was then venial ; Chalmers himself admits that, had the affair been \" dexterously \" managed, it \" would have probably proved successful ; \" 2 and it was known that France had succeeded in bribing the King to betray the political interests of his subjects. Hence the proposition of a douceur to his Majesty appeared not so absurd as it might under other circumstances ; and the colonists, in their dilemma, unwarily fell into the trap which their cunning enemy had purposely set for them ; for, no sooner had they adopted his advice, than he infamously denounced them as rogues and rebels, and made such sport of their folly, that the agents complained of the contempt which was heaped upon them, and of the ridiculous position in which the country was placed. 3 The fate of the Charter was now sealed.

Fifty shillings were exacted for the probate of a will, and widows and children were compelled to travel to Boston, on all business relating to the settlement of estates, whither all public records were ordered to be removed.4 The Governor was supreme ordinary, and acted by himself, except a few months whilst he was in New York, and in the Eastern country, when Mr. Dudley served as his Deputy.

Hence it was a grief to our fathers, when the appointed day arrived, that Allen, the pastor of one of the churches in Boston, from the literal version of the improved Bay Psalm Book, gave out the words of the 21st Psalm to be sung : \"Jehovah, in thy strength And joy in thy salvation The king shall joyful be, How vehemently shall hee !

The consent of his church was asked for his absence ; and when the subject was proposed to them, he observed : \" If you say to me, Stay, I will stay ; but if you say to me, Go, I will cast myself on the providence of God, and, in his name, I will go.\"2 But, though the church concurred cheerfully in the proposition for his departure, it was no easy matter to escape the vigilance of Randolph, who had instigated Dec. 24, Dudley to issue a warrant for his arrest.

The Council opposed the measure, and the people of Boston May 24. were divided in opinion ; but, after two days debate, the Governor and magistrates, chosen in 1686, signed a paper signifying their willingness to take conditional charge of the government according to the rules of the charter, for the conservation of the peace and safety of the people, until an orderly settlement arrived from England. 1 Apr. 22.

And even the magistrates themselves, in their address to the crown, felt it necessary to apologize for some of their proceedings. 1 The first advices from England were somewhat encour aging, and hope revived. But subsequent despatches were much less favorable.2 Mr. Mather was still in London as the agent of the colony, and, upon the overthrow of James, he was introduced by Lord Wharton to the Prince of Orange, and congratulated him upon his happy accession to the crown, and humbly implored his favor to New England. \" I will show them,\" was the reply, \" all the favor in my power.\" \" But I doubt,\" it was added, \" there have been irregularities in their government.\" \" If so, they shall be reformed,\" was the rejoinder of the agent. \" And I'll be their guarantee,\" added Lord Wharton ; \" We two will stand bound for New England, that they shall act regularly for the future.\" \" Then,\" continued the King, \" I will forthwith give order, that Sir Edmund Andros shall be removed from the government of New England, and be called unto an account for his mal-administration.

Accord ingly, in the House of Commons, where the whole subject of to seizing Charters in the reign of Charles the Second was up for discussion, the Charters of New England were inserted with the rest, and, though enemies opposed the measure, it was voted that their abrogation was a grievance, and that they should be forthwith restored. Thus the popular branch of the government acted favorably towards the colonies ; but, as the bill was yet to be submitted to the House of Lords, great pains were taken to interest that branch in the measure, and at the same time, letters having arrived giving an account of the proceedings in Boston, another interview was held with the King, before whom, in a \" most excellent speech,\" Mr. Mather \" laid the state of the people ; \" and his Majesty was pleased to signify his acceptance of what had been done in New England, and his intention to restore the inhabitants to their ancient privileges ; but \" behold,\" adds the narrative, \" while the Charter Bill was depending, the Convention Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued, and then dissolved, and the Sisyph\u00e6an labor of a whole year came to nothing.\"1 All that was obtained was an order that the government of the colony should be continued under the old Charter until a new one was settled, and a letter from the King Aug 12, was forwarded to that effect, with an order, signed byjuiv3o, our charter confirmed by our King and Parliament.

From the disposition of the next Parliament, nothing favorable to New England was expected ; and, having failed in procuring a writ of error in judgment, to be brought out of Chancery into the Court of King's Bench, all hopes of the restoration of the Charter were reluctantly relinquished, and application was made for a new grant, which should confirm the privileges of the old instrument, and such in addition as the experience of the people had taught them would be of benefit. A petition was presented for this purpose by the Earl of Monmouth, formerly Lord Mordent, a firm friend of New England ; and, by the inter cession of another eminent personage, the King was pre vailed upon to refer the affairs of New England to the two Lords Chief Justices, and the Attorney and Solicitor Gen eral, all of whom were supposed to be friendly to the applicants.

Through the favor of Madame Lockart, Mr. Mather was likewise admitted to an interview with the Queen, of whose condescension he speaks in the highest praise ; and at the return of the King from Holland, two more conferences were held with him. There were other parties in interest, however, besides Massachusetts, who were anxious to obtain a charter of the King ; and, as Mr. Wiswall of Duxbury was present at Boston when the new agents embarked for England, he was desired to accompany them in behalf of the Plymouth Colony, though he was furnished with no credentials by the magistrates of that jurisdiction.

Mr. Wiswall, in obedience to his constituents, vehemently opposed this step. The Solicitor General, highly incensed, struck Plymouth out, and the design of its annexation to New York was revived. Intelligence of this design was not long in reaching America, and the people of Plymouth were greatly alarmed. Yet, with singular pertinacity, \u2014 though natural enough, perhaps, under the circumstances in which they were placed, \u2014 they desired Sir Henry Ashehurst to renew the application for a sepa rate charter, without signifying any preference to be joined to Massachusetts rather than to New York, in case of the failure of that application. Happily, the sentiments of the more prudent were known to Mr. Mather, or Plymouth might have been joined to New York, and the interests of the Pilgrims and Puritans divorced, instead of blended into one ; and Mr. Hinckley, the former Governor of Plymouth, in his letter to Mr. Mather, expressed the thankfulness of the colony for his intercession in its behalf. x It had been evident for some time, that William and his Ministers had resolved to erect a new government in Massa chusetts, which was to be known as the Province of the Massa chusetts Bay. The first draught of a charter was objected to by the agents, because of its limitation of the powers of the Governor, who was to be appointed by the King. 2 The second draught was also objected to ; whereupon the agents were informed that \" they must not consider themselves as plenipotentaries from a foreign State, and that if they were 1 Hutchinson, 1. 360-5. 2 4 M.

Mr. Cook and Mr. Wiswall were opposed to submission ; and the Nov. 5. latter, in his letter to Gov. Hinckley, says : \" All the frame of heaven moves upon one axis, and the whole of New England's interest seems designed to be loaded on one bottom, and her particular motions to be concentric to the Massachusetts tropic. You know who are wont to trot after the Bay horse.\" But Mr. Mather, concluding that all parties would be best conciliated by submission, wisely assumed the responsibility of consenting to the adoption of the charter as reported, and to him the nomination of officers was left. x By the terms of this new Charter, the territories of Oct- 7. Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Maine, with a tract farther East, were united into one jurisdiction, whose officers were to consist of a Governor, a Deputy Governor, and a Sec retary, appointed by the King, and twenty-eight Coun cillors, chosen by the people. A General Court was to be holden annually, on the last Wednesday in May, and at such other times as the Governor saw fit ; and each town was authorized to choose two deputies to represent them in this Court. The choice of these deputies was conceded to all freeholders having an estate of the value of .\u00a340 sterling, or land yielding an income of at least 40s. per annum ; and every deputy was to take the oath of allegi ance prescribed by the crown.

Appeals were allowed in all personal actions where the matter in dispute exceeded in value the sum of \u00a3300. To the Governor was given a negative upon all laws enacted by the General Court ; without his consent in writing none were valid ; and all receiving his sanction were to be transmitted to the King for approval, and if rejected at any time within three years were to be of no effect. The Governor was empow ered to erect courts, levy taxes, convene the militia, carry on war, exercise martial law, with the consent of the Council, and erect aud furnish all requisite forts. Free liberty of fishing was conceded to all the King's subjects ; and a reservation of timber was made for the use of the royal navy. In other respects the privileges granted in this Charter were analogous to those granted by Charles the First. 1 Such was the Province Charter of 1692, \u2014 a far different instrument from the Colonial Charter of 1629. That Charter effected a thorough revolution in the country. The form of government, the powers of the people, and the entire foundation and objects of the body politic, were placed upon a new basis ; and the dependence of the colonies upon the crown was secured. How far these changes were of benefit to the country , remains to be seen. It was on Saturday, the 14th of May, 1692, that Sir William Phipps arrived at Boston as the first Governor of the new Province. Writs were immediately issued for a general assembly, which convened in the ensuing month, and the government was duly inaugurated. There was a strong party, as may well be supposed, who reluctantly submitted to this government ; but by a majority it was 1 See the Charter in full,_in the volume published 1814."], [535, "517 CONCLUSION. accepted, and a day of thanksgiving was appointed for its chap. institution.1 51*\" xvni \\^~v^/ Thus having traced the dawn of liberty upon the shores 1692 of Massachusetts, its fluctuating fortunes, and its apparent eclipse, we must pause at the new era in its political his tory introduced by the Province Charter, under which a new course is hereafter to be developed. We have seen the people who settled New England, driven from their native land by religious persecution, erecting, in self defense, upon their arrival in these parts, a system analo gous to that which they had repudiated abroad. We have seen the difficulties which grew out of this policy, and the contests in which it involved them for over fifty years. Yet amidst all these obstacles, we have witnessed the steady and prosperous growth of the settlements, their increase in power, in wealth, and in numbers. And we have witnessed also the gradual advancement of light and liberality ; the development of higher and broader prin ciples of action ; and the diffusion of a more genial and tolerant spirit. Liberty, from the outset, was sacredly cherished. It was yearned for, and sought, as the greatest of all blessings. And the glowing patriotism which pre vailed so extensively ; the sturdy resistance to all op pression ; the jealousy with which popular rights were so earnestly guarded ; and the manifest desire to secure and enjoy the highest freedom compatible with the acknowl edged allegiance of subjects, are striking and prominent traits in our annals. It is to be borne in mind that, up to this date, with but very slight exceptions, the whole course of events traced in these pages, transpired under the dominion of as arbitrary princes as England ever saw: \u2014 princes who trampled upon the constitution they should have cherished ; who violated the laws they were 1 4 M.

Coll., 2. 307. 44"], [536, "518 conclusion. chap, sworn to observe ; and who struggled with desperate Crv-v!- energy to aggrandize their own power, at the expense of the interests and the liberties of their subjects. If, there- fore, the course of our fathers appears at times unjustifi- able, when viewed from the stand-point which we now occupy, or inconsistent with the maxims of English juris- prudence, which were then in an unsettled state, we are to consider the circumstances in which they were placed ; the ignorance of the age ; the difficulties they encountered ; the opprobrium which was heaped upon them ; and the blindness and bigotry which stamp as well the annals of England as those of America ; and to every candid mind these considerations, and others which will naturally sug- gest themselves, will furnish a sufficient apology for all apparent irregularities, and for excesses which may be regretted if they cannot be wholly excused. There is as little, however, in our annals, which needs an apology, as in the annals of any nation on the face of the globe. Ours is a history as proud as that of the most ancient and privi leged monarchies of the old world ; and prouder in pro portion to the problems which have been wrought here, of the deepest, most thrilling, and vital significance."], [537, "APENDIX.
