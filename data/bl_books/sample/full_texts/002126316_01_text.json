IN June, 1801, while the war between Eng land and France still continued, I obtained his majesty's license to visit the latter coun try, in order to ascertain my claims to a legacy left me at Paris. A french passport was likewise necessary; and such were the difficulties which occurred, that, notwith standing repeated applications to M. Otto on the subject, the instrument in question was not yet arrived, when, on the first of Oc tober, an extraordinary gazette announced the joyful intelligence of the signature of pre liminary articles of peace. The jealousy of the french government ceased with the war; and, three days after its termination, I re ceived the Jong expected passport, Being one of the first englishmen who arrived in France, after a war big with . such unparallelled events, I determined to keep a journal of my proceedings. The object which, at first, induced me to do so, was a 2"], [14, "PREFACE. simply to gratify the curiosity of an intir mate friend, who had charged me, on leav ing England, to forward to him, by every opportunity, detailed accounts of moderi} France. Of my correspondence, thus be gun, I took regular copies; and, on pe rusing the materials which I had been able to collect, it afterwards occurred to me, that some of these setters might become not to tally unjnterestjng to the public, if formed into a less objectionable shape, ai]d freed from the many little occurrences, which they originally contained, and whjph only related personally either to my friend or my? gels.

I beg leave, as a check against faults of this kind, which I may have involuntarily committed, to request my reader to remember, that the observations now laid before him, arc those of a man accustomed to english opinions, english so ciety, and english manners. In judging of another country, a foreigner cannot help making a comparison between what he has known at home and what he sees abroad. In doing so, the partiality, which he na turally entertains for his own customs, may lead him to condemn, as faults, what may be simply deviations from the former. That such is the general bias of the human mind, I am fully aware, and I cannot flatter my self that mine has escaped it. This con sideration must plead my excuse with the french, if I should sometimes appear severe ; and the same ought to prevent my country men from placing too implicit a confidence in my judgments, where it may be my mis fortune to condemn.

The causes, events, and consequences of a revo lution, which has no parallel in history, I leave to abler and more experienced writers. To point out to strangers the objects most interesting at Paris, to convey some previous information to those who intend going thi ther, and to lay before such as are prevented, by their other occupations, from undertaking the journey, an account of the pleasures, fes tivals, buildings, and mode of living in that metropolis, is the task I have undertaken, a task which, however comparatively humble, is neither useless nor unimportant.

THE AUTHOR."], [17, "PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. THE first edition of this work appeared ano nymously. Its rapid sale and the favourable manner in which * The Rough Sketch,\" has been received induce the Author, as a mark as respect and gratitude to an indulgent Public, to affix his name to this second impression. In doing so, he begs leave to apologize for the typographical errors found in the first edition, and which he can only correct in that which is now issued, by means of an errata. These faults may, perhaps, be pardoned, when it is known that the Author was in the most dis tant part of Italy at the time of the first pub lication, and that most of the sheets which compose the present impression, were struck off previously to his return, In reading the following pages the Public will also have the goodness to remember the period at which they were written. When the Author speaks of Bonaparte, he speaks of him in other days. In May, 1 SOU, when these"], [18, "ll PREFACE. letters were concluded, the First Consul was the elected first magistrate of France, the pro fessed friend of England, and the acknow ledged pacificator of Europe. He had not at that time overturned the form of government which he had solemnly sworn to maintain, by assuming for life the reins of power. He had not then violated the laws of nations and the rights of a free, virtuous, and independent people by the subjugation of Switzerland. He had not then insulted his Majesty and the British nation in the person of our ambassador. He had not yet dared to ask for changes in the most valuable and purest parts of our ex cellent constitution, u0r had he sunk the dig nity of his character by a conversation which at once betrayed his vanity, rashness,- and un bounded ambition. In one word, the laurels of Mareng.o were yet unfaded. He was then a great man.

MY DEAR SIR, x\\.T length, arrived in this celebrated city, 1 execute my promise in commencing a correspon dence, which, on my part, shall in future be strictly confined to the curiosities of the place. As I have been only three hours at Paris, I shall in this first letter speak of nothing but my journey. . On the 26th of October, I left the York house, at Dover, (of which Payne is still the civil land lord); and embarking at one o'clock on board a neutral vessel, which I was compelled to hire, no english packet boat fyeing yet allowed to enter the ports of France, found myself, after a safe and pleasant passage, at four, on the con tinent. Though I have before crossed the Chan- 1"], [26, "2 LETTER T. nel, and in as rapid a manner, I was forcibly struck by the wonderful and almost magical change of situation which this short voyage had effected. Rising at my usual hour, I had break fasted, and walked about the streets of Dover, surrounded by english faces and english customs. The sun had not yet set, and I was now in a fo reign country, and that country so lately the enemy of mine, and the seat of such extraordi nary and many coloured events. I had changed a monarchical for a republican government. I saw a different people, different dresses, and different countenances, and I was subject to dif ferent laws, and different customs. As soon as the vessel entered the port of Ca lais, two custom house officers came on board, in a military uniform (for every sonctionnaire public has here a regimental dress); and, after taking the names of the passengers, one of them retired, to make his report at the municipality, while tire other stayed to prevent our landing, till the return of his companion. In the mean time, the jetie, or pier, was crowded with spec tators, the greater part of whom were military men, of different ranks and different descrip tions. They seemed highly amused in staring at the dresses of the ladies, and in examining the body of my carriage, which was hung on the. deck of the ship ; while we were equally enter tained with the great moustaches of the greua-"], [27, "3 tETtERI. hadiers, the wooden shoes of the peasants, and the close caps of the grisettes. At length, monsieur de la Douaine returned. We were permitted to touch the territory of the republic; and, conducted by a guard of Bour geois (who, in their dress, rather resembled the ragged regiment of Terence, than the renowned warriors of France), we proceeded to the custom house, from the Custom house to the municipal lity, and from the municipality to the commis- saire's. Aster undergoing examinations at each of these offices, delivering our passports, and giv-\u00bb ing up our pocket books and letters (which Were returned the following day), we were at last permitted to retire to our inn, the tattered guard, which accompanied us from the ship, having been previously dismissed. At six o'clock, I sat down to an excellent dinner, at the cele brated hotel, formerly kept by Dessein, who is now succeeded by his nephew, Quillacq, a very respectable man, who met me at landing, and, with the utmost civility and attention, took charge of my carriage, baggage, &c. I wished to have set out the following morning for Paris, but I was informed that this was impossible, as, though I brought with me a passport from M. Talley rand, it was necessary to have this exchanged for one of the mayor of Calais, which latter could not be cilivered till late the following B 2"], [28, "4 LETTER r. day. I accordingly passed tuesday in this towfy which gave me an opportunity of visiting the theatre, which is still at Dessein's. To the best of my recollection, there is no alteration in the building since the war ; and, from-the darkness of the house, I am inclined to think, that even the painting has not been changed. The actors are not very good, yet better than the generality of our country performers in England. The house was full, and the company well dressed. In short, this amusement may be considered as a very pleasant resource for travellers detained at Calais, either by contrary winds, or by delays in the delivery of passports. On Wednesday morning, Mrs. and my self proceeded with post horses. We found the roads very bad, particularly near Boulogne; and, if our conveyance had not been particularly easy, we should have suffered very severely from the fatigues of the journey. It is necessary to add, that numerous workmen were employed in every part of the roads in repairing and amend ing them. Probably, therefore, before next sum mer, tlie communication between the two prin cipal cities of Europe will be restored to its former excellence. At present, the roads have ra:her the appearance of leading to some de serted village, than to the capital of la grande nation. The post horses are active and well-"], [29, "5 LETTER I. fed, their drivers civil, and the expense mo derate*. Though we left Calais at break of day, and did not stop either to breakfast or to dine, we did not reach Montreuil, where we proposed sleep ing the first night, till sunset. Here we found excellent accommodations, at the inn celebrated by Sterne. The house has, indeed, nothing to recommend it, in point of outward show ; and, in this respect, differs entirely from the generality of french hotels : but if comfortable beds, su periorly good cooking, and the smiling attention of two very pretty girls, who act as waiters, are any attractions, I can safely point out this inn, as one at which ray countrymen will do right to stop. ' From Montreuil we proceeded the next day, through a fine country and bad roads, to Amiens. The cultivation seemed good, and in the villages through which we passed, the peasants were well clad. In the towns, the number of beggars was as great as formerly. At every post, we were surrounded with the old, the blind, and the lame ; some of whom, not satisfied with voci- ferating their complaints, actually climbed up the springs of the carriage, and put their faces * Three horses and a post boy cost six livres, or five shillings per post. The post is two leagues, or sive mile3 english. B3"], [30, "6 LETTER T. within the windows, more effectually to draw our notice. The waiters, post boys, and landlords, were every where remarkably civil, and all expressed their joy at seeing once again amongst them \" les milords Anglois,\" by which title they have not forgotten to call, and to tax accordingly, all english travellers. The people appear to me not only civil, but respectful, and infinitely more so, than before the revolution. The reason is plain, the old noblesse treated their inferiors with a degree of familiarity, which produced in the latter a mode of speaking, that, to an english ear, seemed highly offensive, but which the french permitted, because they could check it at their pleasure. The loss of their rank has now com pelled the higher classes to command respect by a distance of manner, which has of course pro duced a similar conduct in the persons beneath them. At Amiens, we drove to \" J 'hotel d'Angle terre,\" where we were magnificently and mise rably lodged. Fine rooms, superbly furnished ; windows and doors, which would neither keep out the rain nor wind; bad fires, and a worse supper, formed the complete picture of a french jnn, and the colouring of extravagant charges was not omitted. Starved with cold and hunger *we left Amiens b^ break of day, on friday morning ; ancl after"], [31, "LETTER L 7 travelling through a country, the beauty of which increased every step with the increasing badness of the roads, we at length reached Chantilly, not a little pleased at having escaped the dangers of a broken neck. At the post office, which is a new inn, built since the revolution, directly front ing the park of the ci-devant chateau, we found good beds, and a comfortable supper, prepared by the kind attention of some english friends, who had preceded us on the road. The following morning (the 30th), we visited tl^ ruins of this once magnificent spot. If we had had often reason, during our journey, to deplore the destructive effects of that mis taken spirit of pretended philosophy, and pre tended patriotism, which had levelled with the ground the churches and country scats, the ruins of \u25a0which reminded us, in every village, of the excesses committed during the revolution ; we made these reflections with double force, and double regret, in viewing what was once the palace of Chantilly. The principal building is entirely pulled down ; but le petit chateau, and the superb edifice of the stable, still remain. This latter was saved by the orders of the pre sent government, who forbade its being sold ; and the mistress of the inn, with tears in her eyes, acquainted me, that had Bonaparte been at the head of public affairs six months sooner, the palace woukl have been rescued from B 4"], [32, "8 LETTER I. destruction. That extraordinary man visited Chantilly after the sale, but before the demolition of the building. He heard that the purchaser had ordered it to be pulled down \u2014 he expressed his regret ; but, at that time, he had no means of preventing what he sincerely deplored. The stables, though unhurt, are neglected and dirty. They contain, at present, a regiment of ca valry. The woods have also been greatly thinned; the garden no longer exists; and, altogether, Chantillv presents rather the picture of decayed magnificence than that of actual beauty. On leaving this once celebrated place, we found a fine paved road all the way to Paris. The regular avenue of hills, the rich country, the vineyards, the villas, and the carriages of all descriptions which we met, announced an ap proach to the capital, at the gates of which we arrived at two o'clock. Here, and at Boulogne, we were asked very civilly for our passports, which were instantly returned us. These were the only interruptions or examinations which we experienced, during the whole of our journey. Carriages are not stopped, as formerly, at every town, to be searched for contraband goods, but, en revanche, turn pikes are numerous and expensive. The inns are nearly as dear as those of England ; and it is now not less necessary, than under the ancien regime, to make a previous bargain, before the"], [33, "LETTER I. 9 horses are taken from the caniage. If this is not done, impositions and disputes are sure to occur. On arriving at Paris, I drove to several hotels, before I could get accommodated at all. 1 am now wretchedly lodged, and fear, from what I have already seen and heard, that I must waste a considerable portion of valuable time, before I shall obtain such apartments as I wish. Good rooms are very scarce, many of the hdtels garnis having been unfurnished during the revolution, and those which remain being nearly filled with foreigners, who, since the peace, have flocked hither in great numbers, from every nation of the world. Persons, intending to visit Paris, ought to write some days before hand to their correspondents, if they desire to be comfortably lodged on their arrival. Adieu, my friend. I have now given you a full account of my journey. I say nothing of Paris, or its inhabitants, the only person I have yet seen being M. Peregaux, my banker. His new dignity of senateur has made no alteration in his conduct. He is as civil, and as obliging as ever. As soon as I have seen any thing worth com municating, I shall write again.

Paris, november tlie 6th, i8or (15 brumaire, an 10.) MY DEAR SIR, JtTAVING in my last letter given the details of my journey, I shall proceed to speak iu this of what I have already seen at Paris. The first ob jects of curiosity to which my steps were directed, \u25a0were of course the Thuilleries and the Louvre. Of the garden of the former it is difficult to say any thing at this unfavourable season of the year. It appears, however, to have undergone but little alteration, ancl to have received the additional ornament of several statues, which are scattered about the grounds. The chateau or palace ofthe Thuilleries is also unchanged in that part of it which faces the garden, but the appearance of the great front, (I mean that towards the Carousel,) is much improved, and has becomestrikingly mag nificent. It promises to be still more so, when the whole of the projected amendments are com pleted. When I last visited Paris, a number of small houses surrounded the palace, and seemed to conceal it from the profane eye of the vulo-ar. 3"], [35, "LETTER II. 11 The greater part of these houses are already pulled down, ancl the gallery of the Louvre, no longer kept from view, forms a magnificent side to the spacious court by which the palace is ap proached, ancl in which the first consul reviews his troops, on the 15th of every month. This court is separated from the street, by a beautiful iron railing, the sour gates of which are ornamented with the celebrated horses taken from Venice, and with the birds (I believe cocks) which, in imi tation of the roman eagles, the french republic has adopted as her distinguishing symbol. The opening is already extended as far as la rue St. Nicaise. Houses are daily pulled down, and I understand it is the intention of the present go vernment to clear away all the remaining ob stacles, which separate the palace of the Louvre from that of the Thuilleries. When this great plan is fully executed, the residence of the first consul will greatly exceed in magnificence all the palaces of Europe. In the Louvre is situated the museum or musie central des arts. This superb collection, without exception the finest in the world, occu pies a room equally unrivalled, covering a space at least equal to a quarter of an english mile.

An excellent likeness in full length of madame Bonaparte, and a beautiful miniature of a father and a son, by Isabey, were the only objects which attracted my attention. My impatience soon carried me forward. At length I found myself in the magnificent room, which I have before mentioned, the walls of which are covered as far as the eye can reach with the sublimest efforts of human art. Where the mind has long been promised a pleasure, when fancy has dressed it in all her choicest colours, how seldom does the reality approach the phantom of heated imagination ! For once I was not dis appointed. I expected it is true, a high gratifi cation. 1 had formed to myself an exalted idea of the objects, which I was about to visit, yet the satisfaction I felt exceeded, far exceeded, what I supposed it possible for the power of sio-ht to afford; nor did I believe that the hand of man was capable of attaining that degree of perfec tion, which I now beheld. For some time I was lost in wonder, I knew not where to fix j\u00bby en raptured eye. A catalogue which was offered me, by one of the attendants, and which as I afterwards sound, is drawn up with great clear- T"], [37, "LETTER II. 13 ness and precision, roused me from this pleasing reverie, and gave some order to the train of my thoughts. The arrangement of the collection is admirable. After viewing the masterpieces of la Sueur, le Brun, Nicolas Poussin, aud the three Van Loos, I supposed I had already seen the utmost efforts of the art, and even, under this supposi tion, was ready to allow that my highest ideas of the power of painting fell short of what these spe cimens presented. Think of my surprise, when, looking on my catalogue, I found that I had not yet passed the limits of the french school. As tonished ancl delighted I went on. The flemish, clutch, and german masters occupy the second division. Among them I beheld the exquisite works of Van Dyck, of Hans Holbein, of Paul Potter, of Rembrant, of Teniers, and of Rubens. Sublime as were the first objects that had claimed my admiration, even they were exceeded by the latter. Nor had I yet seen the acme of the art. Charmed with the fancy and execution of ail the flemish painters, I was particularly pleased with the beautiful pasturage, by Paul Potter, every object of which seems alive on the canvass. A fewr steps would bring me in view of the wonders of Italy, to see which so many of my countrymerHiad crossed the Alps; ypt so enrap tured was I with the objects already before me, that it required all the importunity of my com-"], [38, "14 LETTER ft. panions, to persuade tne to proceed. I was soofi rewarded for this temporary sacrifice, and in con templating the almost supernatural works of Cor regio, of Caravaggio, of the Caracci, of Domi nichino, of Guido, of Leonardo da Vinci, of Paul Veronese, of Raphael and of Titian, I dis covered, that what I had seen before were only so many links in the great chain of perfection, which was now complete. If among these models of the art, you wish me to name some particular picture, I should give the preference to the com munion of St. Jerome, by Dominichino, which in expression, colouring, feeling, ancl variety, seems to me to possess every beauty united. Before I quit a subject so interesting in every respect, I ought to mention, that this assemblage of the chefs-d'oeuvre of former times, begins al ready to hold out the promise of improving the taste of modern painters. I saw artists of both sexes, occupied in taking copies of the most cele brated subjects ; and as curiosity led me to observe Some of these unfinished attempts, I discovered, with infinite pleasure, that the figures, and even the countenances of the most striking objects, were in several instances successfully imitated. It is indeed, almost impossible, that the study of such unrivalled works should be pursued, without considerable benefit to the individual, and im provement to the art. To me it appears highly probable, that, assisted by the great facilities and"], [39, "LETTER II. 15 advantages wliich this gallery affords, painting will, in the course of twenty years, recover all its former splendour. An English lady*, who has long very deservedly enjoyed a considerable portion of public praise, is now employed in copying the principal pictures in the museum; and from her designs, prints are to be published, the proposals for which are al ready circulated at Paris. If she should execute her plan as well as one has reason to expect from her known talents, the collection will become highly valuable and interesting, not only to those who have seen the originals, but likewise to such as have not had that advantage. The musee, like everv other establishment of the kind in this town, is conducted on principles of liberality, truly honourable to the government and the nation. The gallery is open to foreigners and artists, every day of the year ; but to the * .Maria Cosway. Her plan is to follow the arrangement of the gallery, and to devote one copper-plate to each of the fifty-seven grand divisions or compartments, of which it at present consists, engaging to continue her work, as the collec tion shall be increased. Tlie size of the copper-plate is to be twenty-one inches high, and seventeen wide. The numbers are to appear monthly, and each is to contain two engravings, with an historical description of the subjects, and the artists, by J. Griffiths. Ditlot the elder, in the Palais royal, receives her subscriptions. Coloured proofs cost thirty-six livres, and plain ones twenty-four."], [40, "16 LETTER II. public, only once or twice in each week. No fee or recompense is either required, expected* or received by any of the attendants; and the exquisite pleasure of contemplating these sub lime pictures, for which indeed it would be diffi cult to fix any adequate price, is enjoyed gratui tously*. The gallery of antiquities, containing statues, busts, ancl basso-relievoes, is immediately under the gallery of pictures. It is divided into la salle des saisons, la salle des hommes illustres, la salle des Romains, la salle de Laocoon, la salle de I'A pollon, et la salle des Muses. Were I to attempt an account of all these statues, my letter would never end. I shall there fore only mention those by which the rest, however excellent, are rendered petty, and contemptible, in comparison with them. I mean the Apollo * I ought perhaps to mention, that judges of painting have frequently, in mj hearing, complained of the double light in which the pictui-es are seen in this gallery. Individually speaking, I was always during the very many times when I visited this museum so amused, and so delighted, that I had no inclination to criticise; but it is certainly true, that on some days the pictures were seen to greater advantage than en others. The windows of the gallery are directly opposite to one another, and the paintings are hung on the piers between them. The glare which this circumstance produces, is the cause of the objection I have named."], [41, "tETTER tl. 17 Belvidere, and the Laocoon*. These master pieces of human ingenuity are also so well known, aud have been so well described, that I shall confine my remarks to their present state and present situation. The Apollo seems to have received no injury from the journey, and has as just claims as ever to the preeminence which, for so many centuries, has been allowed it. Did I not fear to appear presumptuous in hinting at any defect in a statue, esteemed so perfect, I should say, that the ancles were rather too thick, in proportion to the rest of the leg, and to the general lightness of the figure. I should have concealed my criticism, if a friend, on whose judgment and knowledge I can rely, had not assured me, that the objection was not novel, and that many connoisseurs have suspected that the legs are modern. Not having had the happiness of seeing this wonderful statue in Italy, I cannot draw a com parison between the spot where it formerly stood, ancl that which it at present occupies. I cer tainly think, that it is not now seen to the greatest advantage. The room is not either high or large enough for the purpose, ancl too many statues are crowded together. \u2014 The Apollo hd- * Next to the Apollo and the Laocoon, the most cele brated statue is the Dying Gladiator, the copies of which are dispersed over almost every co. ntry in Europe. <l"], [42, "18 LETTER II. videre stands between the Venus d' Aries and ano ther female figure, within a railed space of no great dimensions. The catalogue gives the follow ing history : \" No. 145. APOLLON PYTHIEN, DIT APOLLON DU BELVIDERE. (After describing the statue and the subject). \" Cette statue la plus sublime de celles que le tems nous ait conserves, a ete trouvee, vers la fin du quinzieme siecle, k Capo d'Anzo, k douze lieues de Rome, sur le rivage de la mer, dans les mines de l'antique Antium, cite; cel^bre et par son temple de la Fortune, et par les maisons de plaisance, que les empereurs y avaient elevees a l'envi, et embellies de plus rares chefs d'\u0153uvres de l'art. Julius II, n'^tant encore que cardinal, fit l'acquisition de cette statue, et la fit placer d'abord dans le palais qu'il habitait pr&s F^glise de Santi Apostoli. Mais bientot apr&s 6tant parvenu au pontificat, il la fit transporter au Belvidere du Vatican, ou depuis trois siecles elle faisait l'admiration de 1'univers, lorsqu'un h^ros, guid6 par la victoire est venu l'en tirer, pour la conduire et la sixer a jamais sur les rives de la Seine. \" On ignore entierement le nom de l'auteur de eet inimitable chef-d'\u0153uvre. L'avant-bras"], [43, "19 LETTER II. droit et la main gauche qui manquaient ont dti restaures par Giovanni Angelo da Montorsoli, sculpteur el&ve de Michael Ange.\" TRANSLATION. \" THE PYTHIAN APOLLO, CALLED \u00ab THE APOLLO BELVIDERE. \" This statue, the most sublime of those which time has preserved, was found, towards the con clusion of the fifteenth century, at Capo d'Anzo, twelve leagues from Rome, on the sea shore, near the ruins of the ancient Antium, a city no less celebrated for its temple of Fortune, than for the elegant seats, which the different em perors, emulous of each other, had built there, and ornamented with all the rarest works of art. Julius II, while yet. but a cardinal, bought this statue, and placed it first in the palace where he re sided, near the church of the Holy i\\postles. When he became sovereign pontiff, he ordered it to be conveyed to the Belvidere of the Vatican, where for three centuries it excited the admiration of the universe. A hero, guided by victory, drew it from the Vatican ; and, transporting it to the banks of the Seine, has fixed it there for ever. \" The name of the artist, who made this in- imitable chef-d'oeuvre, is unknown. The right arm, c 2"], [44, "20 LETTER II. and the left hand, which were wanting, were restored by the sculptor, Giovanni Angelo da Montorsoli, pupil of Michael Angelo.'' I hope, my friend, you admire the modesty with which it is declared, that the Apollo is for ever fixed on the banks of the Seine ! \u2014 After the singular fate which this statue has experienced, it required all that happy confidence, with which the french determine the most difficult questions in their own favour, to make so bold an assertion. The Apollo lay two thousand years under the ruins of Antium, and yet preserved its beauty. It was drawn thence, placed in the Vatican, and after receiving there, for three centuries, the applauses of mankind, is carried over the Alps, ancl seen at Paris in all its original symmetry. If it be the destiny of this matchless figure to follow the tide of fortune, and to change its residence with the changes of empire, and the casualties of human affairs, who shall decide where it may next be found? If Julius II, when he placed the Apollo in the Vatican, had been told, that, three hundred years afterward, a french warrior would attach it to his car of vic tory, in entering the city of Paris, would even the pope himself have had faith enough to believe such a prophecy? After this, no conjecture becomes improbable. Who knows, that this celebrated statue may not, some centuries hence, be disco- i"], [45, "LETTER II. 21 vered on the frozen plains of Siberia, or in the burning sands of Egvpt? The subject of the Laocoon is so pathetic, and the execution so admirable, 'that the group which it presents, is, as the catalogue well ob serves, a specimen, at once, of composition, art, and feeling. The following is the historical ac count of this statue : \"II a 6t6 trouv\u00a3 en 1506, sous le pontificat de Julius II, a Rome sur le,mont Esquilin, dans les ruines du palais de Titus, contigu k ses thermes. Pline qui en a parle avec admiration, l'avait vu clans ce meme endroit. C'est a eet ecrivain que nous devons la connoissance des trois habiles sculpteurs Rhodiens qui l'ont exe cute, ils s'appellaient Ag^sandre, Polydore, et Athenodore. Agesandre etoit probablement le pbre des deux autres, ils florissaient au premier siecle de Fere vulgaire. La groupe est compost de cinq blocs si artistement r\u00a3unis, que PI me l'a cru d'un seul. Le bras droit du pere et deux bras des enfans manquent. Sans doute un jour on les executera en marbre. Mais provisionnelle ment on les a supplies par des bras moulds sur la groupe eu platre, restaure par Gerardon, qui se voit dans la salle de 1'ttcole de peinture.\"' TRANSLATION. \" It was found in 1506, under the pontificate of Julius II, at Rome, on the Esquiline mount, in the c3"], [46, "22 LETTER IJ. ruins of the palace of Titus, near his therm\u00e6, cfc hot baths. Pliny, who speaks of this statue with admiration, had seen it in the same place. It is to this writer we are indebted for the knowledge of the three able sculptors of Rhodes, who exe- cuted this masterpiece. Their names were, Age- sander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus. Il is probable, that the first of these was the father of the other two. They flourished during the first century of the common era. The g*oup consists of five pieces of marble, joined in so workmanlike a manner, that Pliny thought the whole was of one. The right arm of the father, and two of the arms of the children, are wanting. They will, no doubt, be executed hereafter in marble; in the mean time, the deficiency is supplied by arms moulded on the group in plaister of Paris, the work of Gerardon, which is to be seen in the hall ofthe school of painting.\" In taking leave of the gallery of statues, I ought, perhaps, in answer to several inquiries, which have been made me in letters from Eng land, to mention, that the Hercules Farnese, ancl the Venus de Medici, are not in the collection. A british officer, lately returned from Egypt by way of Italy, tells me, that both these statues are at present in the island of Sicily. They are in the possession of the king of Naples, who keeps"], [47, "LETTER II. 23 them locked up in cases, and refuses permission, even to his greatest favourites, to see them. Adieu. POSTSCRIPT.

I wished very much to have been present at one of the performances given gratis to the people ; but I was dissuaded from going there, by the advice of some french friends, who assured me, that the attempt would be attended with considerable"], [65, "LETTER III. 41 danger. I therefore contented myself with visit ing the only spectacle* where money was re ceived. * Spectacle. \u2014 This is so important a word, and of such ge neral use in french conversation, that I cannot too soon intro duce it to the notice of my english reader. It means, first, all the theatres, puppet-shows, pantomimes, horse exercises, and other motley amusements of this gay capital. It is also perpetually in the mouths both of gentlemen and ladies. If you ask one of the former, whether he were pleased with the opera, he replies, \" Oui, enchante ; le spectacle etoit magnifique.\" (Yes, delighted ; the spectacle was magnificent.) And if you put a similar question about a ball to one of the latter, you receive a similar answer. If you speak with enthusiasm of the picture gallery, a parisian coldly observes, \" C'est bien vrai, c'est un tres beau specta cle.\" (Yes, it is a very fine spectacle, or sight.) If a stranger inquire, whether the monthly parade of Bona parte's troops deserve its celebrity, he is told, \" Oui, c'est un tres beau spectacle.\" (Yes, it is a fine spectacle.) It is also the favourite theme of conversation ; and a parisian compelled to talk with a foreigner, is sure to begin with the following words : \" Allez vous souvent, monsieur, au spectacle ? Ne sont ils pas bien beaux nos spectacles ?\" (Do you often go to the spectacles ? Are not our spectacles very fine ?) A similar observation forms likewise the hospitable kind of consolation which an englishman sometimes receives, if he complain, that he has not seen much of french society. \" Mais cependant, vous ne pouvefc pas manquer d'amuse ment; a Paris les spectacles sont si beaux.\" (You cannot want amusement, however ; the spectacles at Paris are so fine.)"], [66, "42 LETTER III. The company of italian actors usually oc cupies the Thedtre Favart, but at present performs in a very beautiful little play-house belonging to \"la Societ6 olympique,\" situ ate in the street which was formerly known as \"la rue de Chante Reine ;\" but which, iu honour of Bonaparte, (who resided there while a private man) is now called \" la rue de la Victoire.\" The entrance to this theatre is strikingly ele gant and novel, consisting of a circular piazza, in the middle of which is a grass plot. The building is well proportioned ; and. the chande- In consequence of the general application of this word in France to every thing relating to the stage, a parisian, on his arrival in London, wishing to go to the play, supposed that he had only to look for the word spectacle in a french and english dictionary ; and, having found that the literal translation gave him the same word, with perfect confidence directed his hackney coachman to drive to the spectacle. The fellow, sup posing that he wanted to purchase a pair of spectacles, con ducted him to the celebrated shop at Charing-cross. The frencbman flew into a passion, and by his gestures conveyed, that this was not the place where he desired to go. The coach man, imagining that this was not the optician's, to which he wished to be taken, carried him to several others in dif ferent parts of the town. After a long round, during which the favourite oaths of the two countries w'ere mutually ex changed between monsieur and his charioteer, the former was compelled to pass his evening in the hackney coach instead of the play-house, and thus learnt the difference between french spectacles and english spectacles."], [67, "LETTER III. 43 lier, by which it is brilliantly lighted, extremely beautiful. The music seemed good ; but the female performers relied entirely on the charms of their voice; for I never remember to have seen, on any other stage, such an assemblage of ugly women as this presented. The audience con sisted of the best company at Paris ; and I had the pleasure of seeing there madame Bonaparte, who sat in the stage box, accompanied by mademoiselle Beauharnois, her daughter, and by madame le Clerc, the consul's sister. Bonaparte was also said to be present, but being in a loge grilli, could not be perceived. Madame, as far as I can judge from the dis* tance at which I saw her, has a mild, amiable countenance, which is universally allowed to be the just picture of her disposition. Her person is elegant, and her appearance altogether much like that of an english woman of fashion. Mademoiselle Beauharnois* is a fair girl of sixteen or seventeen, and, without being remark ably beautiful, is extremely interesting. Her manners are modest ; ancl her dress simple, and in good taste.

Excuse this digression, into which I was led bv naming the preparatory rejoicings of the pre ceding evening. I proceed to the f6te itself. The 18th of brumaire, that long expected day, beoran in clouds of rain. The Parisians were au disespoir. Every body predicted, that the vast preparations, which had been made for this jubilee, would be thrown away ; that the illumi nation would fail ; in short, that the whole would be an \" affaire manquie*.\" Those who ventured into the streets, notwith standing the torrents of rain, heard, on every and incurred all the dangers of climate and of war. She did so in obedience to Bonaparte's particular orders ; with whom it is an undeviating principle, that a wife should always follow the steps and fortunes of her husband. * As we should say in english, \" a lost thing.\" The french expression is more commonly used, and is infinitely stronger in its meaning. It is adopted on all occasions of misfortune ; such as to deplore the death ofa friend, or the loss of a \" spec tacle.\" A general was lately killed in a duel. A fair parisian of high fashion, to whom he was much attached, on hearing of the accident, exclaimed, with an accent of deep despair, \" Que je suis a plaindre ! il devojt m'avoir amenee au bai de l'opera demain. Voila une affaire bien manquee.\" (How am I to be pitied ! he was to have taken me to the ball at the opera to morrow.

The re joicings were to begin at four o'clock. About three the weather suddenly changed, the clouds dispersed, the sky became serene. It happened that this took place precisely at the moment, when the first consul appeared at the wiudow of the palace, and every body agreed, that the fa- vourable change was solely produced par la bonne fortune de Bonaparte f. Indeed, it is not without some reason that this prejudice is entertained by the public, and that Bonaparte has, on more occasions than one, ap pealed to his good fortune.

I return to my subject. The signal for the commencement of the f$te was the departure of a balloon, in Avhich monsieur and madame Gar nerin ascended, at half past four o'clock, through a clear sky, which no longer bore any marks of the tempestuous weather of the morning. After the balloon had attained a certain height, a para chute was sent down, and the live animal which it contained reached the ground in safety.

We dined in a back room ; and during the short time which we passed at table (for a french dinner sel dom exceeds an hour), the lamps had been lighted. Never shall I forget the splendid sight, which appeared to have been almost produced by magic, and which burst on us in returning to the salon (or drazeing room), the windows of which command an extensive view of the place de la Concorde, of the bridge of Louis XVI, of the palace or hospital of les Invalides, of the Thuilleries, of the palace of the Corps Legislatif, formerly called \" de Bourbon,\" of the river, and of several buildings in the Fauxbourg St. Ger main. All these striking objects were now one blaze of light. My eyes were so dazzled with the scene which presented itself, that it was some time before I could take a distinct view of each particular beauty. The public edifices I have named, all of which are of the finest architecture, covered with innumerable lamps, arranged with the greatest taste, and which being of different heights, seemed to rise the one above the other ; and the majestic domes splendidly illuminated, and extending the blaze of light as far as the eye could reach, formed altogether a coup d'\u0153'U, which may be conceived, but which cannot be"], [72, "48 LETTER III. described. I had scarcely recovered from the surprise and admiration, which this sight pro duced, when the pantomime, intended to repre sent the horrors of war, and the happiness of peace, began under the colonnade where it was my good fortune to be seated. I must confess, that this farce appeared to me ridiculous, and equally unworthy the great nation which gave the f Ste, and the important event which it was intended to celebrate. Sham combats, fall- ing towers, Avounded heroes, devils Avith torches, allegorical emblems of Discord, &c, follow- ed by cornucopias, dancing peasants, cars of triumph, and lastly, by an illuminated temple of peace, Avhich rose on the ruins of that of war, formed the principal entertainment. 1 think you will agree Avith me, that such a spectacle Avas better calculated for the stage of Sadler's Wells in London, or the Ambigu-comique at Paris, than for the principal object of a great and national festival. Simple and plain as is this reflection, it did not seem to strike any of the french spec- tators, and the wisest of them looked on Avithout disgust, and almost Avith admiration, on that Avhich, instead of commemorating the most im- portant event which Europe has seen for many years, appeared to the eye of reason only suited to entertain the dotage of age, or the simplicity of infancy."], [73, "LETTER in,' 49 If the pantomime were not very deserving of praise, it forms a single exception; and I can assure you, Avith great truth, that every other part of the fete was truly magnificent. As no carriage Avas allowed to roll that evening (a laudable precaution, taken on all such occasions at Paris), and as the fireworks Avere to take place on the river, at some distance from the house where I dined, it Avas necessary to pass on foot, through the vast croAvd which filled la place de la Concorde, the walks of the Thuilleries, the bridges, the streets, &c. Yet such was the order that was preserved, and such the tranquillity of the people, that, accompanied by my wife and one gentleman, I made my Avay, I suppose, through nearly a million of people, without the least accident, and v/ith certainly not more crowding than is daily experienced at a private fashionable ball in Lon don. What astonished me most, indeed, the whole day, Avas the dead calm Avhich prevailed among the spectators. They looked on, walked about, and seemed entertained Avith the shows which Avere exhibited; yet no cries of triumph, no shouts of joy, expressed the public satisfac tion. The apathy Avhich prevails in this country on all public events, and which has succeeded to the fever of> popular violence, is strikingly ap parent on all occasions, but on none more than this.

The alleys were brilliantly decorated Avith rows of lamps, suspended on frames constructed for the purpose ; and the pa lace was itself, if possible, still more resplendent. The Avhole had the appearance of an enchanted castle. From a house on the quai Voltaire, 1 saAV the fireworks to great advantage; and they appeared to me, accustomed only to such as are exhibited in England, extremely beautiful. What pleased me most in the display, Aras a contrivance, by which the fire seemed to rise from the Avater ; an ingenious and elegant idea, by Avhich the in ventor probably meant to represent allegorically, by the union of opposing elements, the recon ciliation of two nations, always the rivals, ancl so long the enemies, of each other. There was a temple of commerce on the river, and little boats, with pendants of different nations. All this I consider as forming a second act to the pantomime exhibited on the place de la Con corde, and which I haA'e already ventured to condemn. Both appeared, to an english eye, in significant, if not ridiculous. The fireworks appeared to me as perfect as possible; but there Avas some discontent ex pressed by the persons near me, that Avhat is called a bouquet, Avith which they were to have concluded, was not displayed.

I cannot pretend to determine this important question; but I must be permitted to say, that if the parisians Avere fiot satisfied Avith this day's amusement, they must be very unreasonable in deed in their pursuit of spectacles. I returned home about eleven at night, much delighted Avith what I had seen ; and though Mrs. \u2022 aud myself Avere again obliged to pass through this mighty croAvd, Ave neither of us ex perienced the slightest hurt, or the least in civility.

State of society at Paris. \u2014 The three sets, Vancienne noblesse, the governmental class, and les parvenus on nouveaux riches. \u2014 Description of a house belonging to one of the latter. Paris, november the 19th, 1801 (j8th brumaire.) MY DEAR SIR, JY1 Y two last letters Avere filled with details of pictures, statues, pantomimes, and fetes. In this, I shall only speak to you of men and manners. Visiting Paris after a revolution which has produced such extraordinary alterations in the laws, customs, and opinions of the people, I ex pected to find an equal change in the state of society, A great change has certainly taken place, but the change is of a different nature from what I foresaAv. An english lady, of much Avit, said to me the other day, \" When I armred at Paris, I expected to meet AA'ith philosophers in every society, and to hear nothing discussed but subjects of the highest import. Alas ! how have I been disappointed!\" As to me, I enter tained no such idea ; but I certainly supposed that the political events in Avhich every person had been forced, in one Avay or other, to act a part, would have accustomed the minds of men to such a variance of opinion, that all subjects E 3"], [78, "54 LETTER IV. Avould be canvassed Avith liberality, and that, whateA'er might be the sentiments of an indivi dual, he would be heard Avith tolerance. The lady I have mentioned was not more mis taken than I have been. There is no country under the sun, where less freedom is alkwed in conversation. I do not mean to say, that the government checks or interferes Avith what passes in private society; on the contrary, I have more than once heard in company remarks made at the expense of persons in power, Avhich even in England Avould be thought inflammatory: but what I complain of is, that in every circle there is a certain creed, or string of opinions, from which, if one of the company Avere to venture to dissent, he Avould be considered as \" de maurvaise compagnie*.\" These opinions are not confined to the affairs of France, but extend themselves to those of England ; and in the societies Avhere I have been thrown, I have been more than once suspected of Jacobinism, for not joining in a philippic against Mr. Fox, or in an eulogy on lord Grenville. As to society, it appears to me, that there are three great divisions, or principal classes, at * \" De mauvaise, compagnie\" \u2014 \" of bad company, unfit /or good company.\" The terms, \" bonne compagnie,\" and \" mauvaise compagi.ie,\" are for ever in the mouths of coquettes and petits-matires. It is difficult to define what, I believe, is meant to be indefinable:"], [79, "LETTER IV. 55 Paris. The first, in point of antiquity, and per haps still of public opinion (for, notAvithstanding all the laAvs to the contrary, family prejudices are as strong as ever in France), is that of I'ancientie noblesse*, avIio separate themselves almost en tirely from the other classes, ancl live together at the houses of such of their body, as are still rich enough to give assemblies. The second, which I shall call the governmental set, consists of the ministers, of the counsellors of state, of the am bassadors, of the senators, legislators, tribunes, &c in short, of all the constituted authorities. Tbe third class is Avhat the pride of the first deno minates \"les parvenus ou nouveaux riches;!' consisting of the wealthiest individuals iioav in France ; of persons, Avho, taking advantage of the circumstances which have occurred, have en riched themselves during the general wreck of * L'ancienne noblesse, literally translated, \" the ancient nobility.\" I use the expression in french, because the word \" nobility,\" in our language, expresses a very different thing.\u2014 -The nobility of England are a small, respectable, aud wealthy body, . exercising a great and important part of the constitution, ftnd possessed of powers highly im portant to the state.

The first class are still affluent, Avhen spoken of as a body, though few of them have indivi dually large incomes. A distinguished person, connected Avith the government, and to Avhom the most important acts of state have been spe cially entrusted, assures me, that the old pro prietors still hold two thirds of the landed estates of France ; though, in consequence ofthe heavy taxes t laid on them during the Revolution, by the loss of their Avoods, of their feudal rights, and of public offices hereditary in their families, (not to mention the present laAv of descent, by which all children inherit equally), their incomes, # \"Contractors.'' \u25a0f- Every landholder in France, in consequence of a law passed in one of the most violent moments pf the revolution, and whiph is still continued, pays one fourth of his real re venue to the state; and as, in particular parts of the country, the rate has been unfairly made, it happens, in some cases, thaf even a half is paid, instead of a fourth. The latter i^ she minimum of the present taxation,"], [81, "57 LETTER IV. though in different degrees, are, in every case, greatly diminished. Some of the old noblesse, notAvithstanding their misfortunes, still livre with considerable splen dour, and have houses \" bien monte\" es,\" in which they give balls and parties. The most distin guished of these are madame la de \u00bb, and madame , Avho have each an assembly once in every Aveek. A ci-devant comtesse, be longing to the society, requested the permission of introducing to these houses an english lady, of whom it Avill be sufficient to say, that though not of exalted rank, she AA'as unexceptionable in every respect, in birth, in character, in fortune, in person, ancl in situation of life. I think you will be as much surprised, and as much irritated, as I Avas, Avhen I add, that this mighty favour was, in both instances, refused. The reason assigned for this strange Avant of hospitality, has induced me to mention the fact. The lady in question, having been accustomed to the highest circles in her OAvn country, and discoArering, for the first time, in this land of \" liberty and equality,\" the humble distance at Avhich the Avise of a commoner ought to regard the chaste and learned festivals of aristocracy, could not help expressing her surprise, if not her anger, to the french friend, avIio had made the application. ti Je suis bien fach\u00a3e*,\" replied madame la * I am very sorry, but to tell you the truth."], [82, "58 LETTER IA\\ comtesse I \" mais pour vous dire la terit\u00a3, the emigres Avere treated witli so little kindness in London, I mean, by the gentlemen and ladies there (for there is no complaint against your government), that it is impossible to persuade their relations to receive the english chez eu.v*\u2014~ vraiment je suis au desespoir.\" I am unAvilling to think, that such is the ge neral language of the body of emigrants.

As to their reception by indi viduals in Great Britain, I must be permitted to observe, that such of the emigrants as dignified the poverty (into which they Avere cruelly thrown) * At their house \u2014 I am really quite distressed. 3"], [83, "LETTER IV. 59 by the propriety of their conduct, found gene rally, if not universally, that respect, to Avhich their dreadful reverse of fortune, and their ho nourable industry, equally entitled them. Those who sought in beggary, in gambling, or in im portunate solicitation, a dishonest and preca rious existence, ought not to complain of an exclusion from society, Avhich was alone pro duced by the impropriety of their own conduct. I hope the complaints against english hos pitality come from the latter class ; if so, the sensible ancl liberal french Avill know hoAV to ap preciate their evidence. If from the former but I Avill not put an hypothesis, Avhich Avould appear to doubt the gratitude of men, whose for mer lives entitle them to esteem. \u2022\u00bb Begging your pardon for this digression, into which I was involuntarily led, I return to the societies of Paris. The second class, which I call the govern mental, is the most polite to strangers. The second consul has a splendid party every Aveek ; and each of the ministers has a day, to Avhich all foreigners may be taken by their respective ministers, after they have been presented at the Thuilleries. Le Brun, the third consul, frequently gives dinners; and english parties, Avho have been in vited, assure me, that they are particularly plea sant. He is a man of great literary acquire-"], [84, "60 LETTER IV. ments, and the conversation at his table gene rally takes a superiour turn. The ministerial assemblies are croAvded ; but the houses are large, the attendance good, and the uniforms of the constituted authorities, and the full dress of the ambassadors, give, altogether, a splendour to these meetings, which no others at Paris possess. The third class \u2014 I mean, that -of \" the par venus*\" \u2014 if not the most elegant, or the most esteemed, is, at least, the most luxurious. No thing can exceed the splendour of the persons of this description. The furniture of their houses, the dress of their Avives, their table, their plate, their villas, in short, all the \" agrcmens\" of life, are in the highest style of oriental magni ficence. To give you some idea of their manner of living, I will describe to you the house of ma dame , Avhich I yesterday obtained the per mission of seeing, in her absence. The house is situate in a street leading from the Boulevard, and is approached by a fine court, of considerable length. The back of the house looks on a very pretty garden, arranged ii Vangloise. It was formerly the residence of a minister of state. The draAving room, and salle d mangers, were not yet finished. The furniture prepared for * \" New Comers,\" upstarts. f Eating room("], [85, "61 LETTER IV. them was rich. I did not think it particularly beautiful ; but the bed room, and bathing ca binet, exceeded in luxury every thing Avhich I ever beheld, or even ventured to imagine. The canopy of the bed Avas of the finest muslin, the covering of pink satin, the frame of beautiful mahogany, supported by figures in gold of an tique shapes. The steps, Avhich led to this de licious couch, Avere covered Avith red velvet, ornamented on each side with artificial flowers, highly scented. On one side stood, on a pede stal, a marble statue of Silence, with this in scription : \" TUTATUR SOMNOS ET AMORES CONSCIA LECTI*.\" On the other, a very lofty gold stand, for a taper or lamp. A fine mirror filled up one side of the bed, and Avas reflected by one at the top, and another at the opposite side of the room. The Avails Avere covered with mahogany, relieved with gold borders, and noAv and then with glass. The Avhole in excellent taste. The bathing cabinet, which adjoined, Avas equally luxurious. The bath, when not in use, forms a sofa, covered with kerseymere edged Avith gold; and the whole of this cabinet is as pretty as the bed room. Be yond this room is the bed chamber of monsieur, plain, neat, and unaffected ; and on the other * Silence guards the slumbers and the loves of this bed."], [86, "62 LETTER IV. side a little closet, covered Avith green silk, and opening on the garden, in Avhich madame sits, when she amuses herself with drawing. To conclude, I find the \"loves,\" Avhich \"Silence guards,\" and of Avhich this paphian seat is the witness, are those of January and May ; for the wife is twenty (the greatest beauty of Paris), and the husband something less than sixty. I have made my letter of a most unpardonable length, and yet my subject is not complete. I will, hoAvever, stop for the present, only request ing your permission, when I haA'e the oppor tunity, of adding such details, as I may be able to collect, relative to the different societies I have mentioned. Before I conclude, I ought, perhaps, to mention, that the generals are seen both in the second and third classes, but rarely in the first. Subalterns do not mix in society, at least, I have not yet met one in company. Adieu."], [87, "63 LETTER V. Opening of the legislative body. \u2014 Election of the president. \u2014Lord Cornwallis. \u2014 Reflections of the people in the gallery. Paris, november the 23d, l8oi (afrimaire), 1 MY DEAR SIR, YESTERDAY being the first of \"frimaire,\" the clay on Avhich, by the present constitution, the legislature and tribunate begin their session, I de termined to attend the opening of the former. As I Avas not acquainted Avith any of the mem bers, I was obliged, by means of a sillier ticket, to seek admittance in one of the galleries devoted to the public. The legislative body holds its sittings in the beautiful palace, noAv called by its name, but better known by its former one, of Palais Bourbon. It is situate in the Faux bourg St. Germain, immediately fronting le pont Louis XVI, and opposite the Chumps Eli sees. The hall, in Avhich the members assem ble, is a very fine room, in which the council of five hundred sat during the directorial go vernment. It is large, of an octagon shape, and would be admirably suited to the purpose, for which it is used, did not its extreme height and arched roof prevent even the strongest voice from being distinctly heard. To remedy this defect,"], [88, "64 LETTER V. green baize is suspended on several parts of the Avail ; but the evil is but little removed by this precaution. The first thing which attracted my attention, Avas the military parade, in Avhich the members entered the room, and the regimental, Costume, in Avhich they were dressed. Drums and fifes announced their approach ; and a guard of honour (for both the corps legislatif and the tribunate have each a regiment) preceded them. The members wear a uniform of blue cloth, em- broidered Avith gold, a tricoloured sash, hussar boots, and a cocked hat, both laced Avith gold. To an english eye, they had more the appearance of naval officers than of legislators. The meet- ing Avas opened by the minister of the interieur, AA'ho ascending the tribune (or rostrum,) congra- tulated in a short speech, the corps legislatif on commencing its session, at a moment when the restoration of peace with all the world confirmed the victories, and completed the happiness of the republic. The eldest member then took the chair, and declared the meeting legally consti- tuted. They next proceeded to choose a presi- dent. Scrutineers Avere appointed to examine the votes, which Avere given in the following manner: The names of the members Avere alpha- betically called over, and each in his turn placed a Avritten paper, containing the name of the per son whom he chose into one of four vases, which were placed on the table for that purpose. When"], [89, "65 LETTER V. all the members had voted, the four vases Avere placed on as many dilferent tables, and each examined by an equal number of scrutineers. These counted the votes, and conveyed the re sult to the temporary president, Avho, after com paring them together, declared that Dupuis, having an absolute majority of 133 voices, Avas duly elected. The former then left the fauteuil*, to which the latter Avas instantly conducted. On taking the chair, Dupuis ordered messages to be sent to the consuls and tribunate, acquainting them, that the corps legislatif Avas definitively constituted, and Avas ready to receive the mes sengers of the government. He then drew from his pocket a Avritten paper, and read a speech, in Avhich he congratulated the meeting on the happy auspices under which it began its session. He had scarcely finished, Avhen the sound of drum and fife announced the arrival of three counsellors of state, with a message from the government. They Avere preceded by huissiers, or ushers, in Spanish hats, Avith three plumes of different colours, and were dressed themselves in their grand costume of scarlet cloth, embroidered Avith silk of the same colour. One of them then ascended the rostrum, ancl read a short speech, declaring what the consuls had done, and what still further they proposed. He congratulated * President's chair. F"], [90, "66 LETTER V. the legislature on the peace, and reminded the members, that the Avar being noAv over, they could devote their whole time to the happiness and tranquillity of the people. He concluded with complimenting the assembly on the conduct which they had pursued in their last session, and Avhich, he said, they Avould doubtless continue in that which was noAv begun. The president as sured him, in reply, that the legislative body would, on all occasions, be ready to assist the views of government in promoting the glory, the peace, and the happiness of the nation. The counsellors of state then retired, and the president read the prods-verbal of the proceed ings and appointments of the senat conservateur, as likeAvise several letters ; some from members, Avith excuses for nonattendance ; others Avith resignations ; and some from authors, presenting books, almanacks, &c. to the legislature. The title of one dedication entertained me not a little. It Avas addressed, \" Au Corps Legislatif, au premier Consul, et a madame Bonaparte*.\" We may conclude, that the Avriter Avas at once a re publican and a courtier. Inconsistencies are often reconciled in France. After these letters had been read, the meeting was closed.

Before I conclude this long account, I must mention, Avith regret, that the persons in the gal lery Avhere I sat, spoke with the most sovereign contempt of the legislative body. \" Ils font * Yes, yes, that tall man is lord Cornwallis.

Paris, december the ist, 1801 (io frimaire.) MA' DEAR SIR, I Had this morning so high a mental treat, that I cannot help communicating to you the parti culars Avithout delay, in the hope of being able, while my mind is strongly impressed Avith the subject, to convey to you some faint idea of the pleasure which I received. I shall not now speak to you of splendid build ings, of glorious monuments of human inge nuity, of renowned heroes, or of brilliant festi- A'als. What I saAV to day interested me, and I am sure Avould have interested you, much more than all such objects united; I mean, the institution des sourd-muets (that humane establishment for the instruction of the deaf and dumb), first founded under the care of the abb\u00a3 l'Epee, and now conducted by his Avorthy successor, the abbe Sicardv Having tickets offered me for an extraordinary meeting, Avhich took place this morning, I will ingly availed myself of the opportunity, and at f 3"], [94, "70 LETTER VI. ten o'clock repaired to la rue St. Jacques, where, in a former convent, this beneficent establishment is carried on. Here I found a large assemblage of respectable persons, Avho all listened, with pleasure and attention, to the simple, plain, and unaffected manner, in which the abbe Sicard ex plained his method of giving to the deaf and dumb the means of expressing their thoughts. \" As foreigners,\" said he, \" unacquainted with the language of the country Avhich they visit, are supposed stupid ancl ignorant by the uninformed, so the deaf and dumb are often considered as idiots, because they are deprived of one sense. No,\" continued he, \" they are not idiots ; they have ideas as Avell as you, and only want an organ to express them.\" He then went on to state, that in most educations children are taught first to speak, and then, sometimes, to think ; whereas, in his plan, he began first by teaching his pupils to think, and then proceeded to in struct them how to express what they had so thought*. * The abbe Sicard, in the course of this lecture, took oc casion to remark, that of all languages, the english was the most simple, the most reasonable, and the most natural, in its construction. As a proof of the truth of his assertion, he informed us, that his pupils, as they began to learn the means of conveying their thoughts by writing, were constantly guilty of anglicisms. He added, that it was difficult to make them lay aside idioms purely english, and still more so, to teach them those which are peculiar to the french language."], [95, "LETTER VI. 71 To exemplify both his plau and his success, he examined Massieu, his favourite and ablest pupil, a young man, about twenty or twenty five years old. As soon as the abb6 expressed, by his gestures, any particular passion, Massieu in stantly Avrote the Avord appropriate to the pecu liar feeling, and then explained the meaning of the Avoid he had written, Avith a vivacity of action, and a variety of countenance, which I never before Avitnessed in any human being. He next Avrote on the Avail, with great rapidity, the chain of ideas, by Avhich the abbe Sicard regu larly advances his scholars, from the expression of a simple thought, to one of greater import. Thus, beginning Avith the Avord \" \\'oir, \" to see, he ended, going on by regular steps, Avith the Avord \"examiner, \"to examine; beginning Avith \"id\u00a3er, \" (a Avord created by Massieu, but answering to \" avoir idee,\" or to have an idea), he ended Avith \" approfondir1,\" to search into; and be ginning Avith \" vouloir,\" to will, he ended with \" bruler,\" to burn with passion. Massieu ex pressed, Avith Avonderful fire, the meaning of each progressive passion, in the changes of his coun tenance, Avhich, when animated, is uncommonly fine. In the course of this meeting, the abU Sicard likewise examined, for the first time, a young woman, noAv eighteen, Avho, at six years old, had become entirely deaf, and Avho could now only f4"], [96, "72 LETTER VI. speak such words as she had learnt at that tender age, many of Avhich she still pronounced imper fectly, and as childien are apt to do. He began with showing us a memorandum, or Avashing bill, in which this girl had drawn her gowns, petti coats, &c. according to the different forms of these articles. Massieu then, by direction of the abbe, drew on the wall different things of com mon use; to some of these she applied their proper names, some she did not know, ancl others she mispronounced. The latter defect M. Sicard immediately removed, by pronouncing the Avord himself, teaching her by signs to moA-e her lips, as he did, by blowing on the hand, and by touch ing some particular fibres of the arm. I cannot satisfactorily explain this operation ; but it will, perhaps, be sufficient to observe, that the abbe, more than once, said, \" by such and such mo tions, I Avill produce such and such sounds ;\" and that, as soon as the girl had imitated the motions he made, she articulated the words, as he had previously promised. The more I saw of this institution, the more Avas I delighted. There Avere forty or fifty chil dren present, Avho, born deaf and dumb, Avere, by the wonderful skill and unceasing care of the respectable abbe, restored to society, to happi ness, and themselves. They Avere seated in dif ferent parts of the room, and conversed Avith each other, though at the greatest distance, by the"], [97, "LETTER VI. 73 means of their fingers, which Avere in constant motion. They had every appearance of enjoying good health, spirits, and vivacity.

MY DEAR SIR, 1 HAVE just received your last letter, and as you complain, that I am not sufficiently minute in my descriptions of private society, I Avill en deaA^our to satisfy your curiosity, by giAing a faithful account of an assembly, or the, as it is called here, to which I Avas invited a few even ings since. The lady, at Avhose house this entertainment was given, belonged to the old court; but having remained in France during the whole of the revo lution, has preserved her property. I drove to her hotel, about eight in the evening, and after passing through a dark and dirty antichamber, in Avhich her servants and those of her guests sat very quietly, while I passed, Avithout moving from their seats, I found my Avay, not Avithout difficulty, into the \" salon,\" or draAving room: In this apartment, the Avails of Avhich bore the faint semblance of having been painted Avhite, some thirty years before, and on Avhich shattered rem nants of tarnished gold might still be discovered,"], [99, "75 LETTER VII. I perceived near the fire, the lady of the mansion. She half rose from her seat, as I approached, and after a short \" bon jour monsieur,\" conti nued in a whisper, an earnest conversation, in Avhich she Avas engaged with an old gentleman, who, as I ha\\e since learnt, Avas a ci-devant duke, lately returned from emigration. As I Avas left entirely to myself, (for I Avas introduced to no one) I had ample time to examine every thing around me. The room, sombre in itself, Avas rendered still more so, by a patent lamp sus- pended in the middle, Avhich was the only light I perceived, and which simply answered the pur- pose of making \" darkness visible.\" There Avere about twenty or thirty persons assembled, of different ages, and of different sexes. Having heard so much of french gayety, I Avas astonished at the melancholy countenances I saAV around me, ancl at the general stupidity of this party. In one corner Avas placed a Avhist table, at Which, two ci-devant countesses, a mem ber of Vancienne academie francaise, and a for mer financier were disputing for sous. There were round the fire, two toavs of fauteuils, or arm chairs, in Avhich the ladies not occupied Avith cards, Avere seated in aAvful state. Tavo or three young men dressed ct I\" anglaise, Avith the pre posterous addition of immense neckcloths, ear rings, and half a dozen under Avaistcoats, lounged about the middle of the room, and now and then"], [100, "76 LETTER VII. caught a glimpse at their favourite persons, in an adjoining glass. The fire Avas monopolized by a party of zealous disputants, avIio, turning their backs to the company, and talking all together, formed a separate group, or rather a debating society, round the chimney. From the loudness of their voices, and the violence of their ges tures, I supposed they Avere discussing some great national question, and expecting to gain much useful intelligence, listened with all the painful attention of extreme curiosity. I soon discovered, to my no small astonishment, that it Avas not the fate of the nation, but the accuracy of an ex pression, which excited their zeal. The abbe Delille had, it seems, in a poem lately published, used this phrase, \" Je n'entends que silence, je ne vois que la nuitV \"Whether it Avas possible \" to hear silence,\" and \" see night,\" Avas the great subject of dispute: and the metaphysical distinctions, nice definitions, ancl pedantic remarks, Avhich this question excited, formed a curious specimen of the french charac ter. Some of the ladies joined in the debate ; and I know not to Avhat height it might have been carried, had not the arrival of the the inter rupted the orators, and stopped the conversation, Avith a subject more agreeable to the general taste. * I hear only silence and see only night."], [101, "LETTER VII. 77 At tAvelve o'clock, the beverage I have men tioned, which the french think unwholesome at all times, and Avhich even the english fear to take at so late an hour, Avas placed near the fire, on a large table, surrounded Avith cakes, creams, cus tards, a large tureen of soup, ancl a bowl of punch, the party crowded round the table, and helped themselves to the refreshments it con tained. When the ceremony was over, those who did not return to the card tables, entered into conversation; and as literary subjects Avere still the favourite theme, a young man, Avith a pompous manner, and a solemn tone of voice, said, addressing himself to me, \"Is it true, sir, that there are englishmen, so blinded by national prejudice, as to prefer votre bizarre Shak speare*, to our divine Racine?\" Endeavouring to avoid a discussion, Avhich I kneAV the answer I Avas inclined to give Avould create, I contented myself Avith observing, that Shakspeare and Ra cine Avere such different authors, that it was ab surd to compare them. \" As Avell,\" said I, \" might you draw a resemblance between, the beauties of Switzerland, and those of Versailles.\" \" The proper simile, \" retorted the first speaker, \" would be between Versailles ancl a barren heath, on which some few beautiful plants may have been accidentally scattered, by the capri- * Your droll Shakspeare."], [102, "78 LETTER VII. cious hand of nature.\" The whole circle joined in the triumph, Avhich my antagonist supposed he had gained, and I in vain attempted to recapitu late, and to translate some of the striking pas sages of Shakespear. Though all condemned our \" heaven-inspired poet,\" I soon perceived, that feAV had ever read, and none understood the sub lime Avork which they presumed to criticise. \" Speaking of english authors,\" cried the mem ber of the ci-devant academie fran^aise, \"makes one think of english orators. I see, by Chateau- Brian's account of England, that the cause of Mr. Fox's retirement from parliament, has been at last discovered ; and that it arose from his mental powers having been weakened by the effect of ex cessive drinking. To this I suppose one must attribute his late unwarrantable attack on the house of Bourbon.\" Astonished at this extraordinary assertion, I took the liberty of assuring the gentleman, that Mr. Fox's talents Avere as perfect as ever, and that his last speech Avas one of the finest efforts of human reasoning. \" Pardonnez,\" cried the academician. \" Mr. Fox could never reason. He was indeed once a fine declaim er, but as to the powers of argument, he never possessed them.\" I was ridiculous enough to combat this absurd opinion, ancl to assure him, that there Avas not an englishman, (whatever his political sentiments might be) Avho Avould not Avillingly"], [103, "79 LETTER VII. bear testimony to the wonderful argumentative talents of the extraordinary man in question.

Can I give you a stronger instance of the taste and justice, Avith Avhich the french pro nounce on the merits of our authors, and public characters ? If Shakspeare is not a poet, nor Mr. Fox an orator, where are Ave to look for examples of perfection? Thus it is on eA'ery subject in this country.

MY DEAR SIR, JVLY curiosity is at last gratified. I have seen Bonaparte. You will readily conceivehow much pleasure I felt to day, in beholding, for the first time, this extraordinary man, on whose single exertions the fate of France, and in many re spects that of Europe, has for some time de pended. I Avas fortunate enough to obtain places in one of the apartments of Duroc, the governor of the palace, from the Avindows of Avhich I saw the review to the greatest advantage. It is impos sible to describe the impatience Avith Avhich Ave awaited the appearance of Bonaparte. Mrs. Avell observed, that her eyes ached Avith looking. As soon as the court of the Thuilleries, (that is to say the ground, Avhich is enclosed Avith iron railings, near the Carousel,) Avas filled Avith the different regiments, who arranged themselves with wonderful skill, and without the least confusion, notwithstanding the limited space allotted them, 6"], [106, "82 LETTER VIII. the generals descended from their horses, Avent up stairs into the palace, ancl. after some little delay, conducted Bonaparte to the door. He instantly sprang on his Avhite charger, (which Avaited for him at the gate) and commenced the review. As he passed several times before the Avindow where I sat, I had ample time to examine his counte nance, his figure, his dress, and his manner. His complexion is uncommonly sallow, his coun tenance expressiA-e but stern, his figure little but well made, and his Avhole person, like the mind Avhich it contains, singular and remarkable. If I were compelled to compare him to any one, I should name Kemble, the actor. Though Bona parte is much less in size, ancl less handsome than that respectable performer, yet in the construc tion of the features, and in the general expres sion, there is a strong resemblance. There is, however, such originality about the appearance of the first consul, that, Avithout having seen him, it is difficult to form an idea of his person. The picture of Bonaparte at the review, exhibited some time back in Piccadilly, and the bust in Shore china, Ay hi eh is very common at Paris, and which has probably become equally so in London, are the best likenesses I have seen. As to his dress, he wore the grand costume of his office, that is to say a scarlet velvet, coat, richly embroi dered Avith gold, to this he had added leather breeches, jockey boots, and a little plain cocked"], [107, "83 LETTER Vllt. hat, the only ornament of which Was a national cockade. His hair unpowdered Was cut close in his neck. After ridingthrough the ranks, and receiving the salutes of the officers, he passed by every regiment, the colours of which were lowered as he Avent on. He then placed himself in the middle of the pa rade, and his generals and aides-de-camp having formed a group around him, he distributed SAVords and firelocks of honour to such officers and sol diers, as in different campaigns had deserved them. Berthier, the companion of his victories, and now minister of war, presented one by one these articles to Bonaparte, Avho having read the inscription Avhich Avas eugraA-ed on each, record ing the action by Avhich it was deserved, delivered Avith his own bauds the respective badges of ho nour. After this ceremonv Avas over, the dilfe rent regiments passed by the first consul, and the captain of each company or troop saluted him in passing. The cavalry went in full gallop, ancl as they approached him stopped with Avonderful neatness. Thus concluded the review. He then. rode with his officers to the palace gate, dis mounted, and retired to his apartments, followed by the generals and a strong detachment of men.

The consular guards are the handsomest men I ever saw, scarcely any are less than six feet high, aud if Ave may believe the report of persons connected with the govern ment, every individual in the corps oavcs his si tuation to long service, or some distinguished act of valour. ' Their uniform is a long coat of fine blue cloth, faced witli white, ancl edged with red, with a yellow button, on which is written \"garde dtts consuls.\" They wear white Avaistcoats and breeches, and a fur cap, with a gilt plate, on Avhich appears the same inscription as that on the buttons. \" La garde consulaire a cheval,\" or consular horse guard, wears the same uniform as the foot of that service. The dragoons are dressed in green, Avith a casque, from Avhich is suspended a large braid of hair.

Generally t speaking, the horses of the cavalry Avere very indifferent, excepting one fine regiment of blacks, which Avas commanded by Louis Bonaparte, the third brother of the consul. As soon as Bonaparte left the ground the re giments began to file off by different gates, in the same good order in Avhich they had arrived, and though nearly ten thousand men had been on the parade, in less than a quarter of an hour not an individual remained. The generals wear blue uniforms, richly em broidered, with tricoloured sashes. The aides-de camp are very handsome young men, dressed in blue jackets, long pantaloons, and hussar cloaks, the Avhole almost covered Avith gold.

The tribunate. \u2014 Speech of Portalis on presenting the code civil in the corps legislatif. \u2014 Debate in the tribunate on the same subject. Paris, december the joth, 1801, (29th frimaire). MY DEAR SIR, 1 WENT this morning to the tribunate, Avhich holds its sitting in the ci-devant Palais royal, in order to hear discussed the proposed project of civil laws. This reminds me, that by a strange and unaccountable omission, I have not in any of my letters mentioned the speech, which the celebrated Portalis delivered on the 24th of last month, in presenting the measure to the corps legislatif, and which speech I Avas so fortunate as to hear. To remedy my neglect, I shall begin mv letter with mentioning Avhat passed on that oc casion ; and shall conclude it with the debate, Avhich took place to day, on the same subject, in the tribunate. Portalis is a man of grave, respectable ap pearance, about fifty years old, and so short sighted, as to be nearly blind. As soon as he ascended the rostrum, the utmost silence pre vailed, ancl the legislators seemed to listen with that profound attention, which is only given to those from whom Ave expect either amusement G 4"], [112, "88 LETTER IX. or instruction. As for me, I received both from his discourse; and I do not remember to haA'e been yet so well contented Avith a public speaker in France. He spoke for rather more than an hour and a 'half, Avithout notes and without hesi- tation. He explained with precision, the prin- ciples ancl the heads of the code, which he Avas ordered to lay before the legislature ; and Avhile he Avas clear and intelligible in every part of his speech, he was frequently extremely eloquent. His principal aim seemed to be, as he expressed it, \" de profiter des lumi&res de notre terns, mais pas de les avancer*.\" He particularly recom- mended a system of laws, corresponding with tnose of other nations, ancl Avhich should strengthen the ties of matrimony, and the security of do- mestic happiness. Among the many strong ex- pressions, Avith Avhich his speech abounded, I remarked the following. \" Pour aimer le monde entier, on pent dire, il faut aimer premiere- ment sa patrie, mais celui qui commenceroit a aimer le monde entier, finira a n'aimer aucun siaysls. La philosophic a fait son devoir, c'est * To take advantage of the discoveries of the present age, but not to run before them. f To love the world at large, it may be truly said, that we ought first to love our own country ; but he who begins with loving the world at large, will probably end in not loving any country whatever.

To day this important question Avas debated in the tribunate ; aud I must confess, that the ex pectations, which I had formed, were not a little disappointed. I did not, it is true, flatter myself Avith the idea of hearing either a Fox, a Pitt, a Sheridan, ora Mirabeau; but I imagined, that among the members of the only deliberative assem bly, now in France, some few men Avould be found capable of discussing with sense, argu ment, and extended views, a measure so impor tant, not only to the present happiness of the country, but to that also of the latest posterity. It Avould be too presumptuous to say, that there are no such men in the tribunate. On the con trary, I know, that there are some members of Arery superiour knowledge, great genius, aud libe ral principles. I shall be forgiven, however, for remarking, that the talent displayed on this occa sion was by no means equal to the dignity of the subject, in question, or Avorthy the assembly in Avhich it was discussed.

Nothing could be duller than these speeches ; eA'ery one of which was read from a Avritten paper. A very ridiculous circumstance arose from this manner of speaking. As each of the discourses had been previously prepared, there was no reference to the argu ments used in the debate; and the advocates and opposers of the measure, equally disregarded, and left unansAvered, the remarks of those who happened to precede them in the debate. I was not a little entertained Avitn the conceit of one of these lamp-oil orators, who discovered, that unless they restored la hi d'aubaine*, englishmen might buy up all the avoocIs of France, ancl thus, at one blow, deprive the government of its ships, and the people of their fuel.

Bai des etrangers, (a public subscription ball). \u2014 Thinness of the_ladies' dresses. Paris, december 27th, 1801 (6th nivose). MY DEAR SIR, I WAS last night at a public ball, given by a club or society, called, \" le salon des etrangers.\" This is an establishment, formed on the plan of our subscription houses in England, ancl lately opened in a handsome hotel in la rue Grange Bateliere, the windows of which look on the Boulevard. It consists of frenchmen, avIio are admitted by ballot, and of foreigners of all na tions. The latter are recei\\ed, (being introduced by a member) on paying the annual subscription of sive louis. The house is handsomely fur nished, and consists of several large rooms, which are open every morning and evening, for the use of the subscribers. Besides the ordinary games played in such sort of houses, there is a very excellent billiard table, ancl a room fitted up for reading, in which are found periodical publications, and ali the newspapers, french, german, and english. It was this latter circum stance Avhich induced me to subscribe; and it is here Avhere I usually end my walk, and amuse"], [117, "LETTER X. 93 myself for half an hour, in running over the publications of the day. The club or society, by Avay I suppose of gaining to its aid the protection and interest of the fair, Avithout which nothing is to be done in France, nor, to speak the truth, any Avhere else, gives a ball, about once in ten clays, and it Avas at one of these assemblies, that I Avas present last night. At twelve o clock, Mrs. and I drove to \" Ie salon des etrangers,\" (for no ball begins at an earlier hour) and the string of carriages was so very long, that we Avere nearly an hour in getting up to the door. I cannot help taking this opportunity, of commending the admirable order preserved by the police, on all such occasions at Paris. Though, from seA'eral streets meeting on the Boulevard, the crowd Avas great, yet there Avas not the least accident, nor even the smallest confusion. Ihe staircase, by which Ave ascended, Avas elegantly ornamented Avith orange, and other artificial flower trees. When Ave entered the out ward room, there Avere already so many persons assembled, that it Avas not without considerable difficulty, that we made our way into the salon, or drawing room. Never shall I forget my sur prise, Avhen, looking round me, I perceived the dress, or rather the nakedness of the ladies. I had heard much of the indecency, of which some females Avere guilty, in respect to costume at"], [118, "94 LETTER X. Paris, and I had already seen specimens of the thinness of their apparel; but till this evening, I thought it only the failing of a few. I noAv saw at least two hundred Avomen, of different ages, and different situations in life, all displaying, without reserve or disguise, the beauties, -which they had either received from nature, imitated by art, or believed themselves by the aid of flattering- fancy to possess. The young and the old, the handsome and the uglv, the \"fair and the brown, all prodigally dragged into common view, those charms, which a virtuous Avoman conceals from motives of modesty, and a sensualist from those of discretion. The buxom girl of sixteen, the newly married woman, and the superannuated mother of a numerous family, Avere all equally exposed. Naked recks, naked backs, and their form, scarcely concealed by a transparent petti coat, left nothing to the poAvers of fancy. You will think,- perhaps, that I am drawing an exaggerated picture; but I can assure you, on the honour of a man of truth, that such Avas the costume of at least two thirds of the ladies pre sent at this ball. The head-dresses, classically imitated from the ancient statues, were elegant ; and the number of diamonds, pearls, and other precious stones, strikingly brilliant. There were many handsome Avomen ; but their beauty Avas uniformly of one kind. The embonpoint, and the nez retrousse., characterised them all. I looked"], [119, "LETTER X. 95 in vain for those graceful figures, and those grecian countenances, Avhich form so often the ornament of an english assembly. Among the most celebrated belles, madame R , the young Avise of an affluent banker, Avas pointed out to me; madame V , an Italian lady, much the fashion at Paris, and the renowned madame Tallien. I think the first rather remarkable, for the singularity of her dress, (her head being or namented \" a la cochoise,\" that is to say, as the peasants of a particular province dress their htir) her extreme fairness, and downcast look, than for any real extraordinary beauty. Madame V is a fine dark woman, \" d'une cer taint age,\" Avith beautiful eyes, and a commanding person. Madame Tallien, notwithstanding her great fame, has, according to me, rather an agreeable countenance, and an enchanting smile, than features excessively striking. She is fair, as the fairest of our countryAvomen ; her neck is beautiful; and her countenance, mild ancl good humoured, is said to be a true picture of her mind. Yet, in spite of these advantages, I never should have discovered in her, the reigning belle of Paris. She, too, is not in the first bloom of youth. The dances Avere, the cotillon, (Avhich they call la contredanse) and the walse. In the former, the ladies displayed that decided supe riority, which the french possess in the art of dancing. As to the walse, I Avas astonished at i"], [120, "96 LETTER JC. the decency, with wliich that very indecent dance Avas danced, by the young parisians; who, placing their arms round the uncovered persons of the handsomest Avomen in the room, yet had suffi- cient command of themselves, not to shock either their partners, or the company, by being guilty of the slightest impropriety. I expressed my sur- prise to an elderly lady, at this extraordinary for- bearance. \" Croyez moi, monsieur*,\" she re plied, ' ' que nos jeunes gens voient tout cela avec I indifference la plus pars ait e. \" What a lesson does this remark hold out to the fair sex, of eA'ery description ! That female is not less deficient in coquetry, and in the art of commanding the affections of men, than in every principle of decency, Avho wantonly exposes to the common gaze of passing curiosity those at tractions, which are only A'aluable, as long as the sight of them is the exclusive privilege of a fa voured lover. The libertine, if he at first looks on with ad miration, soon ceases to care for that which every eye may behold; and apathy, united to contempt, is the sentiment Avhich succeeds to passion. I return to the ball. The crowd became greater and greater, and the heat was excessive; but the scene altogether was lively ancl amusing. * Believe me, sir, our young men see all this with the moat perfect indifference."], [121, "97 LETTER X. A frenchman dc I'ancien regime, hearing me express my surprise at the costume of the ladies, assured me, that excepting the foreigners, there was riot one woman de bonne compagnie in the room; This term of \" bonne compagnie,'* is so often used, and so seldom explained, that I really do not know, whether he meant that there was not a Avoman of the old coUrt, or that there was not a virtuous female present. If he in tended the former, it only proved, that these balls were not frequented by the noblesse ; isthe latter, he Avas much severer in his remark than I had been. I only complained of the ladies being in decent ; he asserted that they Avere profligate. At any rate, the one fault leads so rapidly to the other, that it Avas difficult to make a mistake. Tlie room Avas Avell lighted ; the music excel lent, and the ball, being formed of all the diffe rent classes of society, highly entertaining to a foreigner. There were a great many english pre sent ; most of the ambassadors, and many other distinguished characters. I returned home about three in the morning.

MY DEAR SIR, 1 HE people of all nations cling, with such fond partiality, to their old customs, that it ;is next to impossible to eradicate even the most trifling of these by the power of law. I remarked a strong proof of this to, day. It was an immemorial cus tom in France to celebrate new year's day, by making presents of confectionary, trinkets, and such other articles, to near relations and parti-1 cular friends. Notwithstanding the republican almanack, ancl the use of it in all public acts, newspapers, &c. which makes the year begin with v en demi aire,. answering to our 23d of September, the first of January is still considered as solely entitled to these honours. The Palais royal, as it is univer sally called (notwithstanding its first revolution ary and already superannuated name of \" Jardin d' Egalite,\" and its present constitutional one of \"Palais du Tribunat, \") Avas thronged this morning Avith persons of all classes, Avho soon dispersed themselves among the A-arious shops, in order to purchase these little annual presents, or \" dtrennes,\" as they are called in the language"], [123, "lETTER Xt. 9Q of the country. The jewellers vied with each other in displaying, in their windows, all the taste, fashion, ancl magnificence, of their choicest merchandise; and diamond rings, pearl lockets, and amber necklaces, offered to gallantry elegant but expensiA'e means of testifying its ardour. The milliners brought forth their finest lace, their most tawdry colours, and their most extravagant patterns ; and the confectioners, with streamers at their door, ornamented cakes within, perfumed bonbons, and amorous mottoes, soon found the means of filling their respective shops. What an extraordinary place is the Palais royal ! There is nothing like it in any town in Europe.

Tailors, haberdasher.?-, silversmiths, and watchmakers, offer every va- riety of clothing, of ornament, and of machinery. Booksellers' shops are seen in every corner, Avhere the homme de lettres finds his favourite authors, the romantic young lady her novels, and the politician his pamphlets. Opticians, Avhere the frequenter of spectacles purchases his opera glass, and the philosopher his telescope. CroAvds of unfortunate, and sometimes lovely females, challenge, with every variety of dress, the attention of passengers, and, Avhile they offer a too easy banquet to libertines and dotards fill every reflecting mind Avith pity and Avith sor- row. Such are the objects Avhich the Palais \u25a0royal presents. I ought to add, that while the cellars are rilled Avith inferiour restaurateurs, or eating houses, where bands of music are con- stantly playing, frequently dressed in theatrical costumes; the upper rooms are occupied with gambling parties, cabinets of intrigue, and coffee houses *. The latter have every variety of de- f Coffeehouses. \u2022 The number of coffeehouses (pro perly so called, as coffee and liqueurs are the only arti cles which they supply) is very great at Paris, and they are constantly crowded. Swarms of idle persons spend their lives at these places, playing chess-, talking politics, reading the journals, or sitting still. I have often counted more than one hundred individuals in a coffeeroom of t"], [125, "101 LETTER XI. coration; some are painted to represent the Alps, and others are covered Avith glass, reflect ing in every direction a different room. The gambling tables are numerous ; and I am assured, that on the stairs, descending from one of these, there is a pawnbroker's shop, Avhere it sometimes happens, that a ruined gamester, after losing the contents of his purse, deposits, for the sake of making a last and desperate effort, his Avatch, his buckles, and sometimes his coat. With the trifle moderate size ; ajid there is no hour of the day when the same scene does not present itself. Paris, under every govern ment, and at all periods, will bear the same appearance as to amusements. Montesquieu, in his Persian Letters, gives the following description of the coffeehouses of his time, which applies exactly to those of the day : \" Le cafe est tres en usage a Paris, il y a un grand nombre de mdisons publiques, oil on le distribue. Dans quelques unes de ces maisons on (lit des nouvelles, dans d' autres on joue aux tehees.

There are a great many public houses where it is distributed. In some of these houses the news of the day is reported, and in others chess is played.

There are ice houses at each end, and chairs scattered about, on which the parisians sit in rows, and take lemonade and other refresh ments. The space under the arcades, not oc cupied by the shops, is, as formerly, filled every hour of the day, and the greatest part of the night, Avith figures of all descriptions, with per sons of every class, and, I might add, of every nation in the Avorld, \" Le theatre de Monteaussier\" is still in the Palais royal, besides many smaller play houses. Puppet shows, dwarfs, giants, quack doctors, vo ciferating newsmen, and quiet venders of libels, who in a whisper offer you indecent and forbidden publications, complete the catalogue of many coloured curiosities which this place presents.

It is here, Avhere persons afflicted with that great est of all human calamities, the loss of sight, are taught the means of gaining a comfortable existence, of occupying hours Avhich would other- Avise be painfully tiresome, and of! rendering them selves useful to the community. At the \" stance,\" or public meeting, which I attended this morning, I saw several persons, men, women, and children, either born blind, or rendered so by illness, now able to read, to Avrite, to count, to print, and to perform on different pieces of instrumental music.

What parr ticularly struck me, Avas the ingenuity of a blind woman, Avho had taught her child to read, an in fant about five years old, not afflicted with this calamity. There is a manufactory of steel carried on in the building, in which the blind turn the wheel ; and they also make whips, Avriting cases, purses ancl paper toys of all sorts, which are sold for their private emolument. There is hkeAvise a press, or printing machine, in Avhich the whole process is performed by the blind ; and I am told, books published by them are more than commonly correct. The women knit, sew, and perform other kinds of needlework ; and all tuf them either sing, or perform on some instru ment. They gave us a kind of concert, Avhich, if not very good, proved at least that they un derstood the principles of music. I am almost ashamed to mention, that my pleasure in wit nessing this truly philanthropic establishment, Avas not a little diminished by the dreadful coun tenances of the blind, as the eyes of many, not being closed, exhibited a very disgusting appear ance. I knew, indeed, that they Avere not sen sible of this defect, and that I ought to be satis fied with an institution, Avhich, in rendering them"], [129, "LETTER XII. 105 both happy and useful, had fully discharged its object. To the truth of this reflection my reason fully assented ; yet, malgre moi *, my senses re volted at the sight of human beings, left so im perfect by the hand ot Nature, or so deformed by illness. In leaving \" les aveugles,\" Ave drove to the great plate glass manufactory, Avhich is carried on in the neighbourhood.

Never shall I forget the animation which brightened the countenance of Massieu, Avhile he rapidly wrote these Avords, or the curious and anxious attention Avith Avhich he followed the explanation afterwards. given him of galvanism. In the course of the lecture, he showed, by his questions and answers, that he Avas perfectly conversant Avith the general principles of elec tricity ; and the ease with Avhich he caught the doctrine of galvanism Avas truly astonishing. I am sure you Avfill be struck, as I Avas, at the * As our Saviour did of old, 3"], [131, "107 LETTER XII. (angularity of his conceiving, that galvanism might lead to the cure of the deaf and dumb.

He was taken into a cottage ; but, at the end of a Aveek, he made his escape from the woman, to whose care he Avas intrusted, and fled to the mountains. Here he Avandered about, exposed to the severest cold of Avinter, Avith no covering but a ragged shirt, hiding himself at night in the most solitary places, and in the day approaching the neighbouring villages. After leading, for"], [134, "110 LETTER XII*. some time, this A'agabond life, he came of tin own accord, into an inhabited house, situate in the canton of St. Sernain. Here he Avas seized, Avatched ancl taken care of for three days, and Avas then removed, first to the hospital of St. Ajriqiissf, and afterwards to that of Rhodes^ Avhere he was kept several months. At each of these places, where, of course, he Avas the subject of much interesting observation, he Avas found wild and impatient of control. He Avas in con stant motion, and at every instant seemed to seek an opportunity of escaping. By order of the mi nister of the interiour, he Avas brought to Paris, at the end of the Sth year of the republic (about two years ago), under the catc of a poor, but respectable, old man, avIio became so attached to him on the journey, that he shed tears at part ing Avith him, aud in going aAvay declared, that if he ever should be deserted, he would adopt him as his child. The physician Pinel, to whose inspection the boy Avas first submitted, reported, that the organs of sense in this unfortunate child were reduced, from the Avant of use, to such a state of debility, that, in this respect, he was inferiour to several domestic animals. His eyes, Avithout fixing them selves, and Avithout expression, Avandeied wildly from one object to another, incapable of distin guishing the nearest from the most distant ob jects. His organ of hearing was alike insensible"], [135, "111 LETTER XIII, of the loudest noise, or the softest harmony. The power of the voice Avas lowered to such a degree, that he could not make an uniform and guttural sound. The sense of smelling Avas so little exer cised, that he received, Avith the same indifference, the odour of the choicest perfumes, or the nause ous stench of the filthy couch on which he lay. To conclude, the sense of touching Avas confined to the mere mechanical functions of taking hold of bodies. In respect to his intellectual powers, the same physician stated him to be incapable of attention (excepting as to the- objects of his immediate wants), and consequently incapable also of all those operations Avhich are created by attention^ Destitute of memory, of judgment ancl of the power of imagination, and so limited, eA-en in the ideas relative to his wants, that he had not yet learnt to open a door, or to get upon a chair, in order to reach those objects of food Avhich were held above his grasp. In fact, destitute of eA'ery means of communication, having neither expres sion nor intention in the motions of his body, passing suddenly, and without any presumable cause, from the gloom of apathy, to the most immoderate sits of laughter. Insensible of every kind of moral affection, his discernment Avas but a calculation of gluttony ; his pleasure an agree able sensation of the organs of taste ; his sense, ao aptitude to produce some incoherent ideas"], [136, "112 LETTER XIH. relative to his Avants \u2014 in one Avord, all his exJ istence seemed purely animal. M. Pinel afterwards compared \" le sauvage d'Aveyron\" Avith children born, or become, irrej vocably idiots ; and he was inclined to conclude, that this unhappy child, doomed to an incurable evil, was not susceptible either of sociality or instruction ; but he expressed this opinion with considerable doubt. Dr. Itard, physician to the national institution des sourd muets, from whose interesting little pamphlet I have taken this account, though struck Avith the fidelity of the picture drawn by Dr. Pinel, and the justice of his remarks, was un willing to accede to the unfavourable conclusion with which he had closed his report. Founding his hopes first on the doubtful cause of his sup posed idiotism, and next on the possibility of the cure, he humanely determined to make the edu cation of this deserted child his particular study. This education, or moral treatment, he began, on the general principles laid down by doctors Willis and Crichton, and by professor Pinel himself, though he could not appeal to any par ticular precepts, as no such case had been fore seen in their Avorks. He conceived, that he had five principal objects to effect. 1st. To attach him to social life, in rendering, that life more agreeable than the one which he"], [137, "LETTER Xiii. 113 tiOAv led, ancl particularly by making it more ana logous to the life Avhich he had lately quitted. 2dly. To revive the sensibility of his nerves by the most poignant stimulants, and sometimes by exciting the liveliest affections of the mind. 3d ly. To extend the sphere of his ideas, by giving him new Avants, and by increasing his con nection Avith surrounding objects. ' 4thly. To lead him to the use of speech, by dragging into use the power of imitation by the imperious laAV of necessity. ,5thly. To exercise, during some time, on the objects of his physical Avants, the most simple operations of his mind, and thence to lead it to objects of instruction. Dr. Itard then fully explains the methods Avhich he took towards these important objects, in Avhich, by incessant care, humane treatment; and the assistance of madame Guerin (the female to Avhose protection, as a nurse, the child was in trusted), he has so far succeeded, that he no longer entertains any doubt of his ultimate suc cess. It is impossible for me, Avithin the com pass of a letter, to enter into the details given on this subject. I shall therefore content myself Avith translating the observations, wilh Avhich Dr. Itard concludes the account. \" It may be safely concluded,\" says he, \"from my obsen'ations, that the child, known by the name of the savage of Aveyron, is gifted with the free ex- i"], [138, "114 LETTER Sill. ercise of all his senses; that he giA-cs continual proofs of attention, recollection, and memory ; that he can compare, discern, and judge \u2014 in one Avord, that he can apply all the faculties of his understanding to objects relative to his instruction. It is necessary to remark, as an essential point, that these happy changes have taken place in the short space of nine months, and that too in a subject, avIio Avas thought incapable of attention. Hence Ave may fairly conclude, that his edu cation is possible, if it be not already certain, from the success already obtained, independently of that Avhich may naturally be expected from the assistance of time, Avhich, in its constant unvary ing course, seems to giA'e to infancy all that strength and poAver of unfolding itself, Avhich it takes from man in the decline of life.\" I ought, perhaps, to mention, that this unfor tunate child, to Avhom the name of \" Victor\" has been given* because he listened easily to the sounds Avhich formed that name, has already pro nounced the A\\'ord \" lait,\" milk; that he has learnt to put the letters together which compose that Avord; and that he regularly does so, Avhen he wishes to drink, taking also in his hand a little cup to receive his favourite beA'erage. Dr. Itard assured me, that he entertained no doubt of his ultimately speaking. He is warm, passionate, grateful, and he has already given strong proofs of his attachment to"], [139, "115 LETTER XIII. his nurse, madame Guerin. His person is not very remarkable, but his countenance is mild. His face has been cut in several places. He cannot yet use any tAvo senses at the same time ; and, to enable him to hear, it is necessary to bind his eyes. When he is angry, he makes a noise like the growling of a dop\\ He is now CT CT CT dressed like another boy ; but I am told, it Avas long before they could persuade him to bear the restraint of clothing. I remarked, that Avhile we Avere in the room, he kept' his eye constantly on the door, and that the desire of escaping has not yet abandoned him. To conclude, it seems that he has a mark in his neck, which proves, almost to a certainty, that his life was attempted in his infancy. The hapless offspring of illicit love, he Avas probably first wounded by the trembling hand of an un natural mother ; and then, under the supposition of being dead, thrown into the wood, Avhere he so long Avandered, and was at last discovered. If you feel as much interested as I do on this subject, you will easily pardon the prolixity of my letter. I only regret, that I cannot send you a more perfect account, , I am, Sec. I 2"], [140, "116 LETTER XIV. Detailed account of all the theatres or spectacles* Paris, January sist, l8oz (i Pluviost). MY DEAR SIR, lOU have, doubtless, been surprised, that I have not in any of my letters spoken of theatres, or spectacles as they are called at Paris. I pur posely omitted doing so, till I had had an oppor tunity of seeing the greater part of those which are noAv in vogue, that I might place them all be fore you at one view. \" Le theatre franc; ois de la r^publique, \" formerly called, \" le theatre du roi,\" situate in la rue de la Loi, ci-deATant de Richelieu, deservedly takes the lead. It is here, where the tragedies of Racine, Corneille, and Voltaire, are constantly acted ; ancl Avhere also the best comedies on the french stage are represented. The most cele brated performers in the tragic line are, Talma, and la Fond, among the men ; and madame Pettit, (otherwise called, mademoiselle VanhoA'e,) ma demoiselle Volney, and mademoiselle Burgoing, among the Avomen. Talma and la Fond have each their admirers, and it is a disputed matter in society to Avhich the palm is due. The same thing may be said of the actresses. In some"], [141, "117 LETTER XIV. circles, madame Pettit is commended as a per former of very extraordinary talents, highly su periour to her competitors; in others, mademoi selle Volney is the favourite ; and lately, made moiselle Burgoing has disputed tlie victory Avith both. It is presumptuous perhaps, in a foreigner, to form a judgment on a subject on which natives are divided. I shall only say, that to my english ear, the roaring declamation, common to all the french tragedians, is dreadfully offensive. I must add, that I have more than once mistaken the violence of their action for bombast, and the per jjetual motion of their features for grimace. After making this candid avowal, I do not de serve or expect any credit for the judgment I am about to pronounce. I think Talma less bad than la Fond ; but such is the difference of national taste, that I am sure neither of them would be suffered on an english stage. I enter tain the same opinion of madame Pettit, and mademoiselle Volney, though the latter is to my mind, infinitely superiour to the former. As to mademoiselle Burgoing, she has the great merit of being natural ; and it is for this reason, I suppose, that in several of the neAvspapers here, she is accused of being cold and insipid. J saw her perform \" Zaire\" a few evenings since, and I never rpmember to have been more amused. She is a beautiful young girl of sixteen, Avith a fine expressive countenance, and an elegant i 3"], [142, "118 LETTER XIV. graceful figure. Her voice is clear and articu- O CT late ; her manner simple and unaffected ; and her representation of the different passions strong and impressive, Avithout \" outstepping the mo- desty of nature. \" Her dress Avas elegantly simple, and her deportment truly correct. After the play, \" Zaire\" Avas called for again and again, (this is the highest compliment Avhich can be paid to a performer at Paris) aud it was long before she could be persuaded to appear. At length the curtain drew up, and Talma led her, \" still un- willing, \" toAvards the audience. She seemed really distressed, by the thunder of applause which greeted her, and she rau off the stage, as soon as respect to the company would permit. If mademoiselle Burgoing has the good sense to remember, that this early praise can only be secured by incessant study ; and if she has the courage to disregard the ridiculous criticisms of the french journals, (in Avhich she is daily re commended to use more action, to speak in a louder tone of A'oice, &c. in short, to lay aside the happy naturel, which constitutes her merit) it is highly probable, that in a few years she may become the first tragic actress of Europe. If, generally speaking, I am not pleased with the french tragedians, I entertain a very different opinion as to their comic actors. In this line, I conceiA-e their stage is very superiour to ours. The celebrated mademoiselle Contat, who, spy"], [143, "LETTER XIV. lip so many years, has been the delight of the public, is still here. She retains all her poAvers of acting, and much of her beauty. Mol\u00a3 is as admirable as ever; and Dezencourt and Dugazon, in their different lines, cannot be rivalled. Fleury too, is incomparable ; and AvhoeA'er has seen him act Frederic the 2cl, in \" Les deux Pages,\" has seen the most perfect performance, which any stage ever presented. Mesdemoiselles Mezeray, and Mars (cadette), are also excellent actresses; ancl St. Fal, in many parts, deserves to be considered as a very respectable actor. In the \" Philosophe mari\u00a3,\" in the \" Vieux Celibataire, \" and many other comedies, and in the farces of \" Les deux Pages,\" and of \"le Circle,\" (in which most of these eminent actors perform), I have sometimes forgotten, that I was at the play, and believed I saAV before me, the characters Avhich they represented. In the \"Abb6 PEp\u00a3e,\" (wliich has been so Avell translated into english) \" Morvel\" desen'edly obtains great ap- plause, for the excellent and natural manner, in Avhich he represents the philanthropic abbe. How interesting is this play ! those who have seen, as I have done, the \" institution des sourd muets,\" view it Avith double pleasure. The whole appears like a real scene, and the abbe Sicard has so admirably followed the example of his humane predecessor, that the soul of the latter seems revived in the former ; and in seeing the 14"], [144, "120 LETTER XIV. play, avc forget that l'abbe l'Epee no longer exists. The theatre frangois, though a very large building, is always full, Avhen the good actors perform. You Avill be surprised, perhaps, Avhen I add, that I have not found \" Moliere's\" plays act as well as I expected. I Avas present a feAV evenings ago at the representation of \" Tartuffe,\" and though all the parts were admirably cast, I Avas heartily tired before the curtain had dropped. I have more than once heard the audience hiss some of his farces, believing them to be modern ones; and to say the truth, they are not on the stage, what they appear in the closet. I cannot determine, whether the change of manners, which has taken place, makes us no longer relish a satire on follies, Avhich exist no more; Avhether the metre in which these plays are Avritten, fa tigues the ear, or that the broad fun Avhich they are intended to produce, is too coarse for modern taste. It may arise indeed, from that taste being A'itiated, for Voltaire said, long ago, \" Vous parlez de Moliere, oh son regne est passe, \" Le siecle est bien plus fin, notre scene epuree, \" Du vrai beau qu'on cherchoit est enfin decoree*. * You speak of MoliZre ! Oh T his reign is past ; our age is much more refined in its ideas; our stage, cleared of such trash, is at last adorned with the really beautiful, which was bo long sought for in vain."], [145, "121 LETTER XIV. Without pretending to decide, Avhether my judg ment be bad or good, I can only say, that I haA-e HcA'er yet been entertained Avith the performance of one of Moliere's plays; and if I may judge from the thinness of the house, in some cases, and the unusual noise of it in others, the pari sia'ns are of my opinion. Even the \" Bourgeois gentilhomme\" is obliged to borrow the assistance of a dance; and with this aid, brings but an hw different audience. To conclude my account of \" le thMtre fran 50'is,\" I ought to say something of their company, and of their accommodations. All the spectacles here lose much of their effect, from the undress, in Avhich it is the fashion to frequent the play houses, excepting on a first representation of a new piece, when the ladies make it a point to appear \" en grand costume.\" On common occa sions, hats or morning caps, shaAvls and coloured goAvns, are the toilet of the ladies ; ancl boots, round hats, and great coats, that of the gentle men. Wax candles are not used at all ; and one solitary lustre of (what Ave call in England) patent lamps, suffices for the whole building : this throAVS a dim and melancholy light on the countenances of the audience, and on the ap pearance of the house in general. Nothing, in - deed, can be less lively, than a french theatre. \" La gallerie,\" which is of course filled with in feriour company, occupies that part of the build-"], [146, "122 LETTER XIA'. ing, which in England forms the front and side boxes, and the boxes beloAV are behind the gallery. \" Les premieres\" are immediately above these, answering in height to our green boxes ; but they are considered as the principal seats, and are accordingly the dearest. There are four tiers of boxes above, Avhich, under the respectiA-e names of 2me, 3me, 4me, and 5me, diminish in price, in proportion as you ascend. A box may be engaged before hand, by taking all the places, Avhich A'ary in number, from three to eight ; ancl when this is done, no person Avhatever has the right of coming there, Avithout the permission of those by Avhom it is hired ; and it is not necessary, as in London, to come before the conclusion of the first act. The box, for the whole of the evening, is priA'ate property. It is but justice to add, that if the french theatres are less gay than the english, they are infinitely more orderly; and I never remember to have seen any thing like a dispute, or riot at any of the spec tacles. Women, too, of a certain description, do not ply for custom, (with the single exception of one theatre, which I shall afterwards name) as at Covent Garden, and Drury Lane, and in deed are rarely seen at the larger play-houses. The price of each ticket in the first places, is six livi es, tAveh'e sous, answering exactly to five shil lings and sixpence of our money. The stage box, ornamented with scarlet cloth, richly em-"], [147, "LETTER XIV. 123 broidered, is reserved for the family of the first consul; but he generally occupies a little logc gritl6, or shaded box, in which he cannot be seen, immediately under the large one, in Avhich madame Bonaparte often sits. The next theatre Which I shall mention is, *' the opera,\" or \"le theatre de la r\u00a3publique, et des arts,\" by Avhich latter name it is daily adver tised, but never called. An english man just arrived at Paris, will be much disappointed, if, in going to the opera, he expects to find that blaze of beauty, that striking coup d'\u0153il, and that brilliant assemblage of rank and fashion, to Avhich he has been accustomed in the Hay market. A connoisseur, and \" lover of soft sounds,\" will turn away Avith equal disgust from a performance, in Avhich the miserable rant of french composition takes the place of the bett Italian music. But to those, Avho are contented Avith splendid exhibition, graceful attitude, and extraordinary agility, this theatre affords an amusement decidedly unequalled. The ballets, in this respect, deserve all their celebrity ; and the opera, in addition to the first figurantes in Europe, and the most striking decorations, has to boast some very superiour dancers, without counting either Vestris,, Dehayes, or mademoiselle Chamroi, of whom I shall probably have occasion to speak hereafter ; but Avho, though engaged, have not yet appeared this season. The most"], [148, "124 LETTER XTV. distinguished dancer at present is mademoiselle Clotilde, an almost gigantic beauty, avIio, to great strength and extraordinary height, unites much grace, agility, and knoAvledge of her profession. Her person is Avell made, her figure commanding, ancl her countenance expressive. Next to her in reputation is madame Gardel, avIio is de- servedly a great favourite with the parisian pub- lic ; ancl madame Vestris, madame Chevigney, and several others, are always receiA'ed with con- siderable applause. If the french ballet has a decided advantage over the english, it arises from the great art and neatness, Avith Avhich they con- trive to fill the stage. It is not an unusual thing, to see in processions or dances, which require the pomp of sIioav, two hundred persons assem bled at a time, all of Avhom are so admirably drilled, that the Avhole proceeds Avith the utmost regularity. Lais is the only singer, who enjoys anything like popularity; and judges of music assure me, that his voice is uncommonly good. As to the audience, I have only to refer you to the remarks Avhich I have already made about \" le theatre francois.\" It is the fashion to be, if possible, less dressed at the opera, than at any other spectacle; ancl the boxes (very few of Avhich are hired by the year) are exactly on the same footing as those of the french theatre. The price is something clearer. The lighting is equally defective; in short,"], [149, "LETTER XIV. 125 the Avhole amusement consists in the dancing ; which, notAvithstanding the extraordinary degree of perfection, to Avhich it is carried, does not, in my mind, sufficiently repay you for the ennui of hearing the hoarse screaming of execrable singers, aud for the fatigue of being three or four hours locked up in a hot and gloomy theatre. I never \\isit this house, Avithout feeling the truth of lord Chesterfield's remark, who well observed, that, in going to the opera, he always left his under standing at the door, Avith his half-guinea. I cannot help taking this opportunity, of mention ing- a singular trait in the french character. NotAvithstanding the levity of Avhich, they are, perhaps, not unjustly accused; and notwithstand ing their passion for talking, Avhich I fancy is also indisputable, the most solemn silence pre vails at their spectacles; and if an individual, during the longest ancl dullest performance, ven tures to speak, though in a Avhisper, he is in stantly called to order. I am afraid that the theatre in the Hay market Avould soon loose half its subscribers, if such a rule Avere to be enforced in London, though a Banti, or even a Billington Avere the occasion of it. The stage box of this theatre, also ornamented and embroidered, is kept for the use of the first consul. After \"le th^&tre fran^ois de la repuhlique,\" and \" the opera, \" the most esteemed is \"le theatre comique rue Feydeau.\" The building is elegant, 5"], [150, "126 LETTER XIV. and though smaller than the other two, yet suffi ciently spacious. It is of a circular form, sup ported by Corinthian pillars, and prettily deco rated. It is here, Avhere are performed comic operas, ancl little pieces, in which are blended dialogue ancl music. The singers are very goul, ancl the actors respectable. \" Le Caliph de Bag dad,\" \" la Maison a A'endre,\" ancl \" la Folie,\" are the performances, which have attracted the greatest crowds this winter. Mademoiselle Phyllis is the principal performer. She is a very pretty woman, with an excellent \\-oice, and an elegant person. \" Feydeau,\" as it is commonly called, is much frequented by the fashionables of Paris, and is by many preferred even to the larger theatres. \" Vau deville\" is an extremely pretty little theatre, where short lively pieces are acted, enlivened with songs, all of Avhich have an epigrammatic turn. Cele brated authors, distinguished public characters, and temporary occurrences, are often the subjects of these pieces. The philosopher of \" Ferney,\" is Avell represented in one of these called, \"Vol taire,\" as are, \" Florian,\" \" Gesner,\" \"Scarron,\" Sec. in the pieces called, by their respecti\\'e names. When lord Cornwallis honoured this little theatre Avith his presence, couplets were in stantly sung in celebration of the peace; and a farce has lately been acted here, called, \" le Peintre francois a Londres,\" in Avhich a \\'ery handsome compliment is paid to the english"], [151, "127 LETTER XIV. character. Madame Henry is the heroine of \" Vaudeville.\" She is a good actress, ancl one of the most beautiful women 1 have yet seen in France. \" Le theatre de Louvois,\" is larger than \" Vau deville;\" but smaller than \" Feydeau.\" Here plays are acted mostly of two or three acts ; but they sometimes perform longer pieces. I saw at this house, a few nights since, a comedy taken from Fielding's Tom Jones. It Avas a sentimental drama, ancl neither ill written, nor ill acted ; but the ridiculous use of the following expression, \" Tom, mon cher Tom*,\" in the midst ofa very pathetic scene, had such an effect on my muscles, that I could not recover my gravity for the rest of the eA'ening. Apropos ; the french have a most extraordinary aptitude to make mistakes in translating, and adopting our english appellations. In a serious drama, or in a novel taken from our language, the vulgarism of addressing a young lady, by the nam6 of, \" miss,\" is retained in french ; and the absurd manner in wliich the Avord is pronounced, united to the coarse fami liarity of the expression, often destroys the effect of the best imagined passages. In the same manner, \" Mrs.\" instead of being translated \"madame,\" is written \"mistriss;\" and if \" a lord William,\" or a \" lord Charles\" is mentioned, he * \" Tom, my dear Tom.*'"], [152, "128 LETTER XIV. is sure to be called in the next page, \" Ie chevalier baronet,\" See. A respectable old steAvard re ceives the childish name of \" Dick,\" a heroine is \" miss Peggy,\" ancl a renowned warrior, \" sir Jack,\" or \" admiral Billy.\" I resume my subject. The actors of \" LouA'ois,\" are tolerably good; the house is about the size of our little theatre in the Hay market, ancl the pieces represented here are often entertaining. \" Le theatre de la rue Favart,\" to Avhich \"I'o pera Buffa,\" or the italian opera has lately re moved from \" la salle olympique,\" is a handsome building, the boxes of Avhich are so far more lively than those ofthe other theatres, that they are open. In most of the pky-houses at Paris, the boxes are separated by a partition on each side, like the division of the private ones in London. This is not clone at \" Favart,\" ancl the effect is favourable to the appearance of the theatre ; the company not being concealed from view, as at the other ' ' spectacles.\" Madame Bolla has lately made her appearance on this stage, and has ex cited a considerable degree of public curiosity. She is generally much admired ; and Avhen her name is announced, the house is sure to be full. The music is excellent, the orchestra is Avell chosen, and some of the actors are uncommonly good. The \"opera Buffa\" is particularly patro nized by madame Bonaparte, avIio has a box here, and seldom fails to attend, Avhen any favourite"], [153, "LETTER XIV. 129 piece is performed. The first consul is likeAvise said to be partial to this house. Besides the six principal theatres, Avhich I have already enumerated, and Avhich are not only the most frequented, but also the most central, being all situate in, or near \" la rue de la Loi;\" there are several others scattered about the town, which are full every night. The buildings of many of them are pretty, and the acting far from indifferent. The \" theatre de Montausier,\" in the Palais royal, is deA'oted to little farces, ancl to that sort of comedy, Avhich rather forces an involuntary laugh, than claims a smile of serious approbation. The blunders of a clownish servant, the tricks of Scapin, or the caricature of some reigning fashion, ancl now ancl then a sentimental piece of one act, (for \" sentiment\" is the order ofthe clay, at Paris) constitute the kind of amusement, usually offered at this house. At this theatre are lobbies, oc foyers as they are called, in Avhich the ladies of the \" Palais royal\" roam at large, as at Covent garden ancl Drury-lane. On this account, \" Mon tausier\" is not much frequented by Avomen of character ; though now ancl then it is the fashion, CA-en for the first females of the place to make parties, and go there. \" Le th^tre de Moliere,\" as it Avas called, till last Aveek, Avhen it assumed, I know not Avhy, the name of \"theatre National et Etranger,\" is si- K"], [154, "130 LETTER XIV. tuate in \"la rue St. Denys.\" It is a very elegant little theatre, ancl the backs of the boxes are covered with glass, by which means the audience are reflected, and doubled on every side. I saw here, a few evenings since, ' ' le Lovelace Anglois, ou la Jeunesse de Richelieu,\" an excellent come dy, whieh, to my great surprise, Avas very Avell performed by the actors of this house. \" L'Ambigu-comique,\" at the most distant part of the Boulevard, not far from the ci-devant Bastille, is much frequented, on account of its splendid processions. Apiece called, \" le Juge ment de Solomon,\" has been so extremely popular, as to render it very difficult to get a seat, Avhen it Avas performed. After several fruitless attempts, I succeeded last night in gaining admittance ; and I must confess, that I was much disappointed. The theatre is little and dirty ; and the stage is too confined for the shoAvs presented on it, to produce any effect. \" Le Jugement de Solomon,\" notwithstanding its great celebrity, seemed to me a very tiresome, dull, uninteresting piece of tawdry parade. \" Le theatre des jeunes Artistes,\" is also on the Boulevard, very near \" rAmbigu-comique.'\" \" La salle,\" or the hall, appropriated to the pur pose, though small, is neat and prettily decorated. Here I saAV a pantomime in five acts ; the hero of which Avas the renowned \" Puss in Boots,\" or \" le Chat botte,\" as he is called by tlie frenck"], [155, "LETTER XIV. 131 Need I add, that I was completely ennuye. The actors are really young beginners, or \"jeunes artistes;\" and I fear, from the promising ap pearance of three or four of the female per formers, (none of Avhose ages exceeded sixteen) that this theatre is a nursery for other places, besides the play-houses. \" Le theatre du Marais,\" I haA'e not yet vi sited ; but I am told, that the building is elegant. A detachment from the company, Avhich I have already mentioned as acting at \"le theatre de Moliere,\" performs at this house. There are likeAvise, \" le theatre de la Gaiet\u00a3, rue Thionville,\" \" le theatre des jeunes Ele ves,\" et \"le theatre sans Pretension,\" on the Boulevard. I have not seen tVm ; but I hear they are exactly on the same plan, and in the same state as \"le theAtre de l'Ambigu-comique.\" Besides these numerous play-houses, there are several exhibitions of horsemanship, on the plan of Astley ; and there is likewise a very curious optical deception, called, \" la Phantasmagoric de Robertson.\" The latter is very Avell worth seeing. After viewing in the outward room various elec- CT trical machines, mechanical inventions, and other curiosities, you are led into a dark apartment, in Which the ghosts of distinguished characters are supposed to appear. This is extremely well ma naged ; and the principle of optical deceptions is exemplified, and clearly explained. A man of K 2"], [156, "132 LETTER XIA\\ the name of Fitzjames also appears as a ventri loquist ; and after he has thrown his voice into different parts of the room, he declares, that the power of doing so is not a natural gift, but sim ply a habit acquired, of varying the sound of the voice.

In addition to the amusements Avhich I have specified, there are innumerable puppet-shows, theatres de societe, mountebanks, tumblers, fights of wild beasts, jug glers, rope-dancers, and quack-doctors.

The play of Henry IV, read by le Texier. Paris, sebruary io, 18.OJ (41 pluylose). MY DEAR SIR, 1 WENT this evening to hear le Texier, so Avell knoAvn in London, read la Partie de Chasse de Henry IV. The reputation of the reader, and the singularity of being present at the recital of a comedy in the french republic ; the fame of Avhich formerly depended on the attachment of the people to the cause of monarchy, and particu larly to the house of Bourbon, drew an unusual croAvd, and I had great difficulty in obtaining ad mittance. \" La salle,\" or hall of \"le Brun,\" ill the rue de Clery, in which subscription concerts are usually performed, Avas the place appropriated to this purpose ; and though the room is ex tremely large, it was soon filled in every corner. The benches Avere in a few minutes occupied, and many persons Avere obliged to stand during the Avhole performance. Le Texier, to my great astonishment, appeared much confused. Though accustomed, for so many years, to appear before the public, he had all the horrours of a young beginner. I knoAv not, Avhether his alarms arose from the numerous audience Avhich he saw col- ls 3"], [158, "134 LETTER XV. lected, from any apprehension he might entertain as to an interruption from the police, or from the criticisms which he expected from the french, who, more conversant in the language, in Avhich he Avas about to read, than those to Avhom he Avas used to address himself, might be less indul gent. From Avhatever cause his fears arose they were very apparent. His hand trembled, the sweat dropped from his broAv, his voice faltered, and in some scenes, he forgot material passages. It is unfair to pass any judgment on a person sq circumstanced, I shall therefore only obsen'e, that I saw with regret, that though much applauded, he Avas but little admired. As to me, I have often been so highly amused and delighted Avith his readings in England, that I Avas more than commonly disappointed. \" La Partie de Chasse de Henry IV\" seems to haA'e lost none of its popularity ; for, notwith standing the very imperfect manner in Avhich it AA-as read, the most unbounded applauses testified the approbation of the audience, at the recital of those passages, Avhich Avere formerly in the mouths of every one. A person unacquainted Avith Paris, Avould have been apt to conclude, from what passed this evening, that the french Avere all royalists. But it must be remembered, that, in the first place, the greater part of those assembled on this occasion, were drawn there by their particular sentiments ; secondly, that any thing new, no"], [159, "LETTER XAr. 135 matter Avhat, is sure to be well received ; and lastly, that Henry the I Vth, besides being the fa vourite of tlie ladies of all parties, Avas at the beginning of the revolution considered as a kind of popular character, whom e\\'en the most violent democrats held up to public admiration. He Avas likewise a military hero; and, after all, there is nothing so much esteemed in France, as mar tial merit. Perhaps it Avas this part of his charac ter, whieh induced general Moreau to attend the reading of a play, of which so renowned a warrior Avas the subject. This celebrated general sat in the gallery, Avith a lady of considerable talents, in Avhose company I afterwards supped. The lady in question en tertained the company, with a lively account of the bon mots, brilliant thoughts, and happy ex pressions of her warlike companion ; but as ma dame is particularly famed for the richness of her fancy; and as, notwithstanding his decided merit as a soldier, no one ever before heard of the conversation talents of Moreau: it Avas uni- A'ersally allowed, that the general was not a little indebted for his favourable testimony to the ima gination of his fair reporter.

Party at afournisseur's. \u2014 Ball at a ci-devant noble's. Paris, february the 15th, 1801 (25 pluviose). MY DEAR SIR, 1 RECEIVED an invitation to spend yesterday evening at the house of an individual, Avho is supposed to have made a A'ery large fortune as a \" fournisseur, \" or army contractor ; and Avhose wife is one of the \" elegantes\" of the new set. I send you, therefore, a faithful account, as de scriptive of that class of society, to which the name of \" les nouveaux riches\" is given. A handsome porte cochere* led to a well lighted and elegant stair case, by which Ave ap proached the salon ; Avhere madame , and some friends Avho had dined with her, Avere seated. As, among the Aery few houses at Avhich I visit at Paris, the greater part are of \" l'ancien regime,\" I have become so accustomed to dark rooms, old furniture, and dismal hangings, that I Avas quite astonished at the splendour of the apartment, into which I was iioav ushered. An elegant girandole of cut glass, made with the greatest taste, and filled with innumerable Avax * Every large house in France is approached by a court yard, the gate of which is called \" la porte cochere.\""], [162, "138 LETTER XVI. lights, gave such a lively appearance to the room, that, for a few moments, I supposed myself in London. The chairs Avere made Avith clas&ical propriety in antique shapes, and the colours were Avell assorted. The carpet (a luxury not often met with in this town) Avas of the finest Brussels manufactory; and the Avails were orna mented Avith designs on the plan of \" Echart.\" We Avere received with much politeness by the lady of the house, Avho is a beautiful Avoman, and who, whatever her original situation may have been, is at present graceful in her manner, highly accomplished, and Avell acquainted with the literature of her OAvn country. Monsieur was neither very, handsome, nor particularly brilliant; but he was very civil, and took no little pride in showing us the suite of rooms which adjoined, to the salon, and which were all, like the latter, splendidly lighted. The apartment next to that in which Ave were received, was covered with pictures representing a naval engagement; and the inscription under neath proved, that they had belonged to the unfortunate Louis XVI. A large claw table was placed in the centre of the room ; and our host, though a good republican, forgot not to inform us, that it had cost him a large sum of money; haA'ing been taken from the Thuilleries, where it had long been in the use of Marie Antoinette. Next to this Avas the bed-room,"], [163, "LETTER xvi. 139 Avhich Avas particularly splendid. The canopy of India muslin, so fine that it appeared like a net, to Avhich Avas added a rich embroidery of o-okL Ihe stand of this cleo-ant couch was of ma hogany, ornamented withantiquefigures correctly carved. The bitudoir, whieh adjoined, almost exceeded in luxury that of madame ****, already described in a former letter. The sofa Avas of crimson A'elvet, edged Avith silver; and the sides and top of this little bijou were entirely coA'ered with the finest mirrors. Beyond the boudoir Avas another bed-room, furnished in a different manner, but with equal taste and equal e.xtrava gance. The party consisted of five or six ladies, Avho were, perhaps, more expensively, than cor rectly dressed, of two of the ministers, and of some foreigners of distinction A musician of eminence performed on the harpsichord ; and accompanied madame **** and one of her friends, Avho both sung very prettily. The eA'ening AA'ould have been pleasant, had there not been a degree of form, which to me Avas not a little annoying. About twelve o'clock supper was announced; Avhich was ser\\-ed on the ground floor, in a small .salle a manger, which Avas also elegantly furnished. The supper Avas good, and the servants Avho waited Avere attentiA'e. I saAV, this evening, for the first time, general Berthier. He is a little man, plainly dressed,"], [164, "140 LETTER XVI. with cropped hair. His countenance is expres sive, Avhen he speaks; but his figure is diminu tive, and his appearance by no means military. He is extremely polite, gentlemanly, and affable. Iam told, he is by birth \" gentil homme ;'' ancl by his manner it is easy to see, that he must have passed the early part of his life in good company. After giving you this account of a party at one of* the new houses, you will, perhaps, not be displeased, if I conclude my letter Avith a short description- of a ball given by a person, formerly of very high rank, and still of consider able fortune. The antichamber, through Avhich it is always necessary to pass at a french assembly, is rather a disgusting sight. The servants, differently occu pied, some playing cards, some sleeping, and others criticising the dress of those avIio pass by them, do not attempt to rise, and even those of the house seldom give themselves the trouble of moving, at the arrival of their master's guests. If the valet de chambre is near, the company are announced; if otherwise, they are alloAved to find their Avay to the apartment of those whom they are visiting. At the ball, of Avhich I am now speaking, in addition to the antichamber devoted to the use I have mentioned, the second drawing room was filled Avith files de chambre, milliners, and mantuamakers, whom the good"], [165, "LETTER XVI. 141 nature of our hostess permitted to sit there, that they might view the dancing, and learn the fashions. I observed, that several of these sou brettes did not direct their attention solely to the jemale part of the company. After passing through these rooms, Ave found ourselves at last in the salon, which Avas ex tremely Avell lighted Avith patent lamps. These are much used at Paris, ancl almost generally substi tuted for Avax. The oil used here is less offensive than that Avhich is bought in London ; and, Avhen a sufficient number of reflectors are placed about a room (which is not very commonly the case) it becomes A'ery brilliant; but the heat is always oppressive. The company assembled on this occasion Avere all of the old noblesse ; and no nouveau riche, no person connected Avith the government, and very few foreigners, were permitted to conta minate this quintessence of \" bonne compagn\\e.\" I perceived many of those faces Avhich I had remembered in London among the emigres of distinction; ancl the lady of the house did not forget to enumerate the families of dukes, comtes, marquis, marechals, &c. Avhich formed her so ciety. It is but justice to this class of company, to observe, that the ladies (whether from a natural sense of propriety, from habits con tracted during their residence in foreign coun tries, or from the Avish of distinguishing them-"], [166, "142 LETTER XVI. selves from their plebeian felloAV citizens, I shall not pretend to inquire) are infinitely more correct in their dress, than those of any other set at Paris. I saw here several elegant Avomen, who were tasteful, withoutbeingindecent; ancl though, perhaps, a hundred persons Avere assembled (which is considered a very large party in this toAvn) there was only one female present, of whom it could be said, that she Avas too liberal in the display of her charms; ancl she Avas the subject of general conversation, and general censure. The ball began Avith tAvo cotillons, or french country dances, Avhich Avere very gracefully per formed by eight gentlemen aud ladies, Avho vied with each other in skill and activity. The rest of tire company Avere seated on benches, Avhich Avere placed in gradations against the Avail. A Avalse was then played; about fifteen couple stood up; and the gentlemen, placing their arms round the Avaists of their partners, moved round the room in a circle, Avhile the young men not so employed. formed a group, and filled the centre. The air appropriate to this dance is extremely pretty, ancl the fio-ines of the ladies are seen to o-ieat advan tage. Yet, notAvithstanding the quiet, respectful manner of the parisians, I must still continue of the opinion of Werter; that no modest Avoman ought to dance the Avalse, unless her partner be either her husband or her brother. 5"], [167, "143 LETTER XVI. After a short interval, I perceived a string of young men crowding together, and forming a line. I learnt Avith surprise, that this Avas the preparation for an english dance; and that the gentlemen Avere taking places for their partners. Though gallantry is, I suppose, the cause of this mode of determining precedency, it is extremely dangerous; ancl the ladies of Paris ought, like our fair country Avomen, to take the trouble of arranging, themselves, so important a question. One or tAvo duels have already taken place, this winter, OAving to the disputes occasioned by the zeal Avith Avhich these \" preux chevaliers\" con tended for the honours of priority; and the evil will daily increase, if this manner of taking places be continued. Walses and cotillons succeeded alternately, for the rest of the evening. About two o'clock in the morning, supper Avas announced. The table, not being large enough to afford seats for all the company, was solely occupied by the ladies. The entertainment consisted of soups, hot dishes, legumes, fruit, and pastry ; after Avhich, as a remove, tAvo large plates, one of turbot, and one of salmon, made their appearance. These, to an english eye, seemed very singular ; but I hear, all good french suppers conclude Avith fish.' After supper, the ball recommenced, and con tinued till six in the morning. On summing up the occurrences of the evening, I remarked,"], [168, "144 LETTER XVL that, though the women Avere handsome, the company elegant in their dress, and genteel in their manner; though the music Avas admirable, ancl the refreshments plentiful and good ; yet there was something Avanting; I mean that gaiety of heart, and that floAv of spirits, Avhich, according to all accounts, the french formerly possessed. The ladies danced to perfection ; but they seemed to do so rather for triumph than amuse ment; and any stranger, coming suddenly into the room, Avould have supposed, that he saw be fore him the eleces of the opera house, not thd daughters of the proud noblesse. Dancing is, in deed, more a science than an entertainment, at Paris; and while those Avho were engaged seemed to study eA'ery step, and to make all their motions by rule, the by-standers looked on, and criticised with the same professional attention. There Avas little or no conversation : the loud laugh, involun tary tribute of joy, Avas not heard ; nor the innocent prattle of unsuspecting, happy youth. I know not whether this total change of character is to be attributed to the heavy misfortunes which the higher classes haA'e experienced, or to some other cause ; but certainly nothing is more obsolete than french vivacity. I have now passed more than three months in Paris ; and have not yet seen among its inhabitants *, one instance of * I speak only of the superiour orders.

When it happens to me to be in english, american, or other foreign companies, I am always surprised at the fun and jollity of the persons around me.

I am happy to say, that he is perfectly recoA'ered from his wound, ancl that he has no longer any marks of lameness. He is not now in the vigour or the bloom of youth ; but his eye is finely expressive. I am sure, Lavater, in seeing it, Avould have said, \" That eye is the eye of a poet, a genius, or a patriot.\" I had not the pleasure of being introduced to him, and can therefore only speak to you of his exterior.

I soon perceived that the whole merit of the piece depended on the interest which an unfortunate prince, banished from the throne of his ancestors, Avas calculated to produce on the minds of the audience ; and if such was the de sign of the author, he was more than commonly * Edward in Scotland. \u25a0"], [171, "LETTER XVII. 147 successful. The passages in favour of royalty, and particularly those which expressed pity for the proscribed, were applauded with inexpressible warmth. The dialogue Avas Avell Avritten, and so artfully worded, that it Avas difficult for any man, Avhatever his political sentiments might be, not to join in commiserating the fate of Edward. The story Avas simple, ancl as Avell as I can trace it from memory, I will give it to you. The young pretender, after being defeated by his enemies, ancl abandoned by his friends, takes refuge, disguised as a peasant, in the isle of Sky. Having passed three days without food, he is driven by Avant into a house, the door of which he finds open. Here exhausted with fatigue and hunger, he falls asleep. In this situation he is discovered by lady Athol, (the mistress of the mansion) Avise of the governor of the island, and the particular faA'ourite of king George. He Avakes, ancl, after an interesting dialogue, con fesses Avho he is. He then asks of lady Athol \" a little bread for the son of him avIio once Avas her sovereign.\" Long divided between the sen timents of humanity and those of duty and gra titude, lady Athol cannot resist this last pathetic appeal, and having supplied him Avith some re freshment, she determines to protect him. In the midst of this scene Argyle, Avho is commis sioned by the britisli government to take the pre tender, arrives, and seeing EdAvaid, expresses T \u00b0 Xa m"], [172, "148 LETTER XVII. some suspicion. To remove this, lady Athol, with that presence of mind Avhich Avomen often possess on such trying occasions, declares, that the person he now sees in the dress of a peasant is her husband, Lord Athol, (whom Argyle had never seen) and who, having been shipAvrecked, was just arrived in this pitiful plight. Argyle believes the story, and having paid his compli ments to the supposed governor, leaves him to take that repose, of Avhich he concludes he must stand in need, after the accident which he had experienced. Edward aftenvards appears in the dress of lord Athol, and in that character is obliged to preside at a supper, to Avhich Argyle and some other english officers had been previously invited. One of the latter, a violent partisan and rough soldier, proposes, as a toast, \" death to all the enemies of George.\" Edward, after a violent struggle, throAvs doAvn his glass, ancl rising from the table, exclaims, \" I will not drink the death of any man. \" After this scene, which Avas, rendered very inte resting to the English, by our \" God save the king\" being played on the french stage, and to the Avhole audience by the last phrase, Avhich Avas received with unbounded applause, the real lord Athol arrives. In this dilemma the courage of lady Athol does not desert her. She makes signs to her husband, who discovers the truth,"], [173, "LETTER XVlt. 149 aud recollecting that Edward had once saved his life at Rome from the hand of an assassin, he de termines to rescue him from the clanger of his pre sent situation. He accordingly pretends to con fess to Argyle, that in assuming the name of Athol, he (Athol) had deceived him, and that he is the pretender after Avhom he is seeking. In this character, therefore, Athol is arrested, and in the mean time Edward, conducted by the faithful steward of lady Athol, makes his escape in a boat. The Avhole then is disclosed, and on the arrival of the duke of Cumberland, Athol is pardoned for this pious fraud, the duke declaring that he is convinced that the king himself, Avould, under similar circumstances, have acted in the same manner. There is a kind of counterplot or episode, in Avhich the celebrated miss Murray appears as the sister of Athol, but her character is not material to the general story of the play. Argyle, Avho is in loA'e with her, asks her of her Edward (Avhile he appears as Lord Athol) ancl this puts him into another dilemma, from Avhich he is also saved by the presence of mind of lady Athol. Mademoi selle Contat played lady Athol most admirably, and the part of Edward Avas performed in a very interest ing ancl natural manner by St. Fall, Avho rose infi nitely above himself in the character assigned him.

Paris, februarythe 15th, 1802 (6ventose). MY DEAR SIR, IHE streets, of Paris haA'e, since sunday last, exhibited a very singular appearance to the eye of an englishman. The carnival is now begun; and the people, being permitted by the present government to return to all their old habits, are celebrating this season of the year with that gayety, Avhim, and eccentricity, Avhich it has long been a kind of religious duty, in catholic countries, to display on such occasions. From six in the morn ing till midnight, the principal streets are crowded with masks of every description ; and while a certain number are contented with exhibiting their fun and their dresses on foot, others are mounted on horses, attended by servants, also in costume, ancl some are seated in carriages of every description. In short, Paris has been one continued scene of jubilee, and it is difficult to pass through the principal avenues of the town, on account of the vast crowds of singular figures, Avho press fonvard on every. side, ancl arrest the attention of spectators. Harlequins, Columbines,"], [177, "153 LETTER XVIII. . beaux, abb\u00a3s, lawyers, and monks, present them selves every Avhere; and Avhile they circulate in de tached parties, mamalukes, turks, ancl Indian sa vages, correctly dressed, Avell mounted, and at tended with bands of music, move in numerous bodies. These, and motley groups of masks of all kinds, filling the inside, top, ancl every part of hackney coaches, landaus, sociables, curricles, cabriolets, and german Avaggons, form lengthened processions on the Boulevard, in the rue St. Honors, and in the neighbourhood of the Palais royal ; Avhile the latter, the Thuilleries, and Champs Elysees, are filled Avith pedestrian and motley coloured Avits, Avho, attacking each other Avith poissard eloquence, amuse not a little the surrounding multitude. It is difficult to convey an idea of the shoAv, variety, and eccentricity of the dresses. In the extraordinary processions, Avhich I have already mentioned, several handsome carriages were em ployed, drawn very frequently by four, sometimes by six, and, in more instances than one, by eight horses. Caricatures of all sorts were exhibited ; and it was curious to see the costumes of friars, nuns, full dressed marquis, poAvdered abbes, and mitred prelates, appearing as masquerade disguises in those streets, where, tAvelve years before, the same dresses excited the serious respect of every one. The people showed considerable fun in many of the grotesque figures Avhich they assumed ;"], [178, "154 LETTER XVIII. and I was particularly pleased witli a fellow, Avho, imitating our english print, was dressed as a monk, and literally carried on his back a young girl enclosed in a truss of straw, with these words written on his burden, \" Provision pour le con- A'ent*.\" Besides innumerable Eves, beautiful Venusses, and handsome legged damsels, dressed as boys, Diana had many a fair representative, clad in flesh coloured pantaloons, and gracefully perched on the edge of a coach box, embracing Avith one arm a Hercules, and with the other an Adonis. I think you will admire, as I did, the admirable choice of such a dress, ancl such a posture, for the goddess of Modesty. The moral conduct of each lady was, doubtless, not less ap propriate than her outward appearance to the cha racter Avhich she assumed. This amusement has already continued some days, ancl will, I am told, last at least ten more. It is difficult to ascertain how the body of the people, Avho alone take part in these sports, can support both the loss of time, and the expense Avhich the dresses, carriages, <Scc. must necessarily occasion. It is indeed reported, that the govern ment pays the whole cost, ancl that the principal characters are hired to amuse the mob; but a re spectable gentleman, Avho was intimately con nected Avith the minister of police under the old Provision for the convent."], [179, "LETTER XVIII. 155 regime, assures me, that the same thing Avas said at that time; and that nothing was more false, though the masks were then as splendid and as numerous as they are at present. I believe, the truth is simply this, that the french are so fond cf pleasure, of amusement, and spectacles of all kinds, that there is no sacrifice Avhich they will not endure, in order to be able to indulge this favourite passion. A parisian will, dine for six days on a sallad, that he may go on the seventh to a ball or a play ; and I have no doubt that the emperors, caliphs, and janissaries, Avhom I have seen to day in such oriental splendour, have. many of them still, like good christians, be gun to mortify the flesh, even before the com mencement of Lent. This necessary sobriety, united to the regulations ofthe police, Avhich are admirable, prevents any disorder or riots in the streets; and notwithstanding the swarms of idle masqueraders, who Avander at present about this great city, I have not yet heard of a single acci dent, or of the slightest disturbance. The carnival is celebrated in the same manner by the higher classes in the evening; and there is a masquerade every night at the opera house. I Avent there yesterday, and observed more gayety among the persons assembled, than I have yet seen in France. The pit being joined to the stage, gave a large space, Avhich was entirely filled. The gentlemen do not usually wear masks, and"], [180, "156 LETTER XVIII. their persons are only coA'ered with a domino. It is' one of the privileges of the ladies to conceal their faces, and t0 attack, Avithout being known, the beaux of thwir acquaintance. This custom takes from the splendour of the masquerade, as very few persons are fancifully dressed, and al most all are occupied in seeking adventures. Nor Avas the conversation livelier than on such occasions in England: the small number of in dividuals who pretended to assume characters, trusted to their dresses, rather than their wit,' for the support of their parts. There Avere \"eng lish jockies,\" who had neA'cr heard of New market, and Avho could speak no language but the french ; haughty dons, Avho could not answer a question in Spanish; actors, who could not re peat a single line either of Racine, Corneille, or Voltaire ; beys of Egypt, Avho knew not the course of the Nile; grand signors, Avho heard, for the first time, that Avine Avas forbidden by the Koran ; and monks, Avho did not knoAv to Avhat order they belonged.

As I Avas very anxious to haA'e an opportunity of seeing, in a private room, and of speaking to Bonaparte, who, Avhatever his political merits or faults may be, is indisputably one of the most extraordinary men Avhom the world ever produced, I requested Mr. Jackson, the british minister, to clo me the favour of presenting me. My name having ac cordingly been sent iu to the minister for foreign affairs, I drove to the palace of the Thuilleries, at three o'clock, Avhere, in a small apartment on the ground floor, called \" la Salle des Ambassa deurs,\" the foreign ministers, and their respective countrymen, Avait till the first consul is ready to receive them. Chocolate, lemonade, sherbet, and liqueurs, Avere served round in abundance ; 1"], [183, "159 LETTER XIX. and, after an interval of nearly an hour, the doors Avere thrown open, and we ascended the great stairs of the palace, which were lined with grenadiers, Avho stood with rested arms on every step. In the antichamber there Avas an officer's guard, which saluted us in passing; and after going through four or five A'ery large rooms, in each of which there Avas on both sides a file of soldiers, avc, at last, found ourselves in Avhat would be called, in England, the presence cham- ber. Here, in a splendid salon, stood Bonaparte, between Cambac&res, the second consul, and le Brun, the third. They were all three dressed in their grand costume of scarlet velvet, richly em- broidered with gold. The generals, senators, ancl counsellors of state, Avho surrounded Bona- parte, retired on our arrival, and a circle Avas instantly formed, the foreigners of different na- tions ranging themselves behind their respective ministers. The imperial ambassador stood on the right hand side of the first consul; next to him was placed Mr. Jackson ; and on the left I perceived count Luchesini, the prussian mi- nister, ancl the hereditary prince of Orange, whom he presented this day. In compliment to the latter, Bonaparte, contrary to his usual practice, began the audience on that side. He spoke for some time to the son ofthe deposed Stadiholder, and seemed anxious to render his situation (awk- Avard and extraordinary as it Avas) as little painful"], [184, "160 LETTER XIX. as possible; but I thought I could remark, in the countenance of this respectable young man, a look which proved that these efforts, though well meant, Avere ineffectual. In passing by each foreign minister, the first consul received the in dividuals of their respective nations with great ease and dignity. When it came to Mr. Jack son's turn, sixteen english were presented ; ancl, after Bonaparte had spoke to five or six of us, he said, with a smile, which is peculiarly his own, and which changes a countenance, usually stern, into one of great mildness, \" Je suis charm6 de voir tant des anglois ici. J'esp\u00a3re que notre nnion sera de longue duree. Nous sommes les deux nations les plus puissantes et les plus civil izees de I'Europe. II faut nous unir pour cul ti\\'er les arts, les sciences, les lettres, enfin pour faire le bonheur de l'espece huniaine*. \" Mr. Jackson made no reply, ancl, of course, no one else could say any thing. The first consul spoke to each individual with politeness, and in quired to Avhat regiments those belonged Avho Avere presented in uniform. He particularly dis tinguished colonel Graham, an officer of great merit in our service, avIio, both in Italy ancl in - I am delighted to see here so many english. I hope our union may be of long continuance. We are the two most powerful aud most civilized nations of Europe. AA'e should unite to cultivate the arts, the sciences, and letters; m short, to im-> prove the happiness of human nature."], [185, "LfeTTER XIX. 161 Syria, had been opposed to the arms of France, Avhen commanded in person by Bonaparte. After going round the circle, he spoke a second time to this gentleman, and paid the same compliment to the hereditary prince of Orange. The audience then closed, ancl we descended with the same ce remonies as in coming in, to \"la Salle des Ambas sacTeurs,\" where we Ai-aited for our carriages. The whole was conducted with great dignity ; and persons used to courts, all agree, that the audience of the first consul is one of the most splendid things of the kind in Europe. The pomp of military parade with wliich it is attended, the beauty of the palace, the handsome uniforms and commanding figures of the soldiery, the va riety of regimentals Avorn by the officers of diffe rent nations, the elegance of taste displayed by some foreigners (for every one not in uniform is in, the full dress of the old court), the splendid stars, ribands, and orders of others, ancl, above all, the celebritv of Bonaparte, unite so many circumstances in its fa\\'Our, that you will not be surprised ar. a judgment, which, to a person Avho has not lately seen Paris, may seem extraordinary. As to the first consul, he is as superiour in little things as in great ones; and, had he been born a sovereign, he could not possibly discharge this part of his duty with more ease, dignity, and de corum. He is also very ready in finding subjects of conversation, and opportunities of civility. \\i"], [186, "162 LETTER XIX. He gave yesterday a proof of this ; Avhich, though I did not hear it myself, I shall venture to report on the credit of a person on wham 1 can rely. A prussian aid-de-camp being presented (whose name I have forgotten), Bonaparte asked, \"Avhere his general had last served?\" The officer replied, \"in the campaign against France.\" \u2014 \"I beg you a thousand pardons,\" rejoined the consul ; \" but it is so contrary to the usual order of things (si pen natures) to see the prussians and french op posed to each other, that the circumstance had entirely escaped me*.\" Before I conclude my account of the audience, I ought to mention, that it may be well called a court ; for it is attended not only Avith all the requisites of shoAV, parade, form, and etiquette, but HkeAvise by that flattery and cringing atten tion, which it was once the exclusive privilege of royalty to receive. I saAV the proudest nobles of foreign courts, decorated with all the trappings of chivalry, humbly bending the body, and anxi- * AVhen the present worthy and respectable minister front the United States of America (Mr. Livingston was presented, Bonaparte said to him, \" Vous venez d'une republique libre et vertueuse dans un monde de corruption.\"\u2014 (You come from a free and virtuous republic into a world of corruption.)\u2014 Mr. Livingston, who is rather deaf, and does not perfectly un derstand french, did not immediately hear him. Bonaparte instantly called to M. Talleyrand, aiid desired him to explain, in english, what he had said."], [187, "163 Letter xtx. tmsly courting the smile of that individual, Avhom, a few years, nay, a few months before, they Avould haA'e branded with the names of rebel, jacobin, ancl usurper; but the creed of courtiers is to change with \" existing circumstances, \" and those, Avhose intrigues against Bonaparte were the most acti\\'e, are now his most obsequious sycophants. But a truce to remarks which lead to politics. The english who were presented immediately after the peace, Avere asked to dinner; but OAving to the greatness, I imagine, of our number, this favour Avas not yesterday shown to us. I regret much having missed the entertainment, as I am told it Avas strikingly magnificent. I Avent in the evening to see a spectacle, in finitely more interesting, according to french ideas, though certainly not so according to mine. I mean, the first appearance, this season, of Vestris, and mademoiselle Chameroi. This Avas at Paris a matter of great importance, and boxes Avere eno-ag-ed for Aveeks before hand. Mrs. > Avas fortunate enough to procure one ; ancl I therefore saw the performance (Hecube, and \" le Ballet de Paris,\") to great advantage. Vestris has certainly lost none of his merit, and deserves, as Avell as eA-er, that celebrity Avhich has long been his ; but I could not help being disgusted at the thunder of applause Avhich greeted his appearance. It is impossible, in deed, to carry further the sublime art of dancing j mS"], [188, "164 LETTER XIX. but how contemptible is it to lavish the praises of a great nation on the exertions of mere bodily skill ! If, as Dr. Johnson avcII observes, \" the garlands due to the great benefactors of mankind should not be suffered to fade upon the brow of those who can boast only petty services ancl easy virtues,\" much less should they ornament the head of him, whose utmost claims on the gra titude ofthe public are the flexibility of his body, or the grace of his steps. Mademoiselle Chameroi, the elhce ancl fa vourite of Vestris, danced delightfully, ancl al most shared the popularity of her protector. Bonaparte was present, and sat, for the first time, in his state or open box. He was Avel comed Avith warm and universal plaudits ; but I blush to add, that they Avere not greater than those which the \" quick-footed\" Vestris had al ready received. Is it possible that the parisians reAvard, with the same honours, the services of their great statesmen, and the exertions of their favourite dancers ? From the opera I went to a supper ancl. con cert, given in honour of the prince of Orange, at the celebrated madame de St l's. Her house is one of the most agreeable in Paris, and one of the few at Avhich foreigners are received with kindness and hospitality. I have not been fortunate enough to form part of her dinner societies ; but I am told, that they Avell deserve"], [189, "165 LETTER XIX. the credit of affording \" the feast of reason, and the flow of wit.\" Her eveuing assemblies, at several of which I have been present, are the liveliest aud best conducted which I have seen in this town. The most distinguished public characters, all the foreigners of eminence, and most of the reign ing belles of Paris, are always met with at her house. Her parties, too, are so admirably ma naged, that eA'ery one does precisely what he Avishes; and a stranger is sure to be amused either Avith excellent music, cards, or, Avhat is better than either, the conversation of the lady of the house. Adieu. This letter is already so A'ery long that I shall make no apology for an abrupt con clusion. w 3"], [190, "166 LETTER XX. The antichamber of the Musee Central, now silled with an additional collection of fine pictures. \u2014 Account of the wonderful recovery of some chefs-d'oeuvre. \u2014 List of pic- tures in this room. Paris, march the soth, l8os (29 vtntosc.) MY DEAR SIR, I WENT this morning to the picture gallery, (or Musee Central des Arts), ancl Avas very agree ably surprised at finding that the antichamber, Avhich, on my first arrival at Paris, Avas filled Avith a miserable modern exhibition, nOAv contains some of the chefs-d'\u0153uvre ofthe first masters. These pictures, taken from Venice, Florence, Turin, ancl Foligno, have lately been arranged ancl deposited in this room. The advertisement to the additional catalogue, published on the oc casion, acquaints us, that the persons entrusted with the management of the Musee, anxious to increase the pleasure of the public, and the im provement of the arts, had regularly exhibited, as they received them, the pictures collected at Bologna, Cento, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Rome, Venice, Florence, aud Turin. But among the number, there Avere some in such a state of decay, that it Avas impossible to place them in the Louvre, Avithout incurring the almost certain 1"], [191, "167 LETTER XX. \u2022danger of their destruction. The administrators, therefore, very Avisely determined to take every possible means of rescuing these sublime efforts ot the art cf painting from that entire ruin, into which they Avere rapidly falling. Their zeal and their perseverance have been croAvned Avith suc cess, infinitely greater than they could possibly have expected. By a report made to the national institute by Morveau, Vincent, and Taunay, it appears, that the celebrated picture of Raphael, called \" la Vierge au Donataire,\" or the Virgin with the Donor, found at Foligno, was in such a state of decay from the dampness of the place, Avhere it had long been deposited, that the *persons em ployed by the french government, much doubted the possibility of conveying it to Paris. After having taken every precaution, which their ex perience could suggest, to prevent the danger which they apprehended, they ordered the re moval ; but they felt, at the same time, that they could not exhibit this masterpiece in France, till they had shifted the ground from the avoocI on which it Avas originally painted, and Avhich had become entirely rotten. \" Le Martyre de St. Pierre le Dominican,\" or tlie Martyrdom of St. Peter the Dominican, es teemed one of the chefs-d'\u0153uvre of the art of painting, and the finest Avork which ever came from the pencil of Titian, Avas also, Avhen found M 4"], [192, "168 LETTER XX. in the church of St. John ancl St. Paul, at Venice,. painted on wood, aud the panuel uncommonly thick. Its great dimensions obliged the commis sioners to order it to be transported by sea to Marseilles. As the frigate, \"la Favourite,\" on board of Avhich it was embarked, met with a storm during the passage, the case Avhich con tained it Avas exposed to the Avet, aud the hu midity found its way to the picture. It Avas no longer possible to discover its beauties ; ancl the only means left of saving the picture, Avas, by removing it from the AVood, and placing it on cloth. This operation, as well as the former one, rendered, in the latter case, still more difficult, by the extraordinary size of the picture, Avas per formed by C. Hacquin, with wonderful skill, great talent, and singular success. The process, Avhich Avas superintended by a committee of the national institute, is given in the catalogue. Both these superior specimens of painting are now restored to all their brilliancy, and to all their original perfection ; ants the principles on which this transposition has been effected, are so smiple, that there is no longer any thing to dread from similar accidents. Tlie prelate continues to state, that this new exhibition unites the most esteemed productions of the florentine, Venetian, and reman schools. Some from the palace of Pitti, at Florence, and some from Turin. Specimens are presented of"], [193, "169 LETTER XX. the works of artists unknown in Paris, and per haps in many parts of Europe. Such are the Hunters, by St. Jean de St. Jean; the Virgin, the infant Jesus, and the infant St. John, by Lorenzo Sabbatim '; and the Ecce Homo, of Cigoli ; to which is added, a \\-aluable picture of various animals, by J. Weeninix, lately bought by the minister of the interior, at the sale of Paillet and Coders, ancl united to the collection of the Musee Central, Avhich, as the catalogue well observes, will become the most magnificent of Europe, if acquisitions are thus made of those productions, which are still wanting to complete it. I shall conclude this account, by mentioning the pictures of the celebrated masters. PAUL VERONESE, No. 44-. \" Les N6ces de Canna,\" or the Marriage in Cana, by Paul Veronese, is a large picture, in which be has introduced all the dresses and extraordinary characters of the age in which he lived. It is one of the four cents, or feasts, and was exhibited in the refectory of the monks of St, George the great, at Venice. The artist received for this interesting picture only 50 ducats, or 675 litres tournois.-. \u2014 The second cene is called \" lc Repas,\" or the Repast at Simon's, and was in the refectory of the fnars of St. Sebastian, at Venice. It is now in the Musee. \u2014 The third is the Repast at Levi's, which forms the number 45 in this collection; and the fourth, in which Paul Veronese paints our Saviour at tlie Pharisee's,"], [194, "170 LETTER XX. has loug been at Versailles, in the Salon d'Hcr cule, having been given to Lewis XIV by the republic of Venice. \" Ainsi,\" says the cata logue, in the style of french gasconade, \" graces au genie de la Victoire, la publique aura bientot la jouissance de voir ces quatre magnisique com positions reunis dans le Musee Central*.\" No. 45.

The Musee has the same work in little. 48. Jupiter thundering against Crimes. Taken from the ducal palace at Venice, where it was placed in the hall of the council of ten. The crimes described in the picture are, Forgery, Exaction, and Treason, which were the subjects specially entrusted to this dreadful tribunal, whose judg- ments were without appeal.

Paris, march the a6th, 1802 (5 germinal). MY DEAR SIR, W E have had for some clays delightful Aveather ; and the parisians have taken advantage of it ia the best manner, by passing seA'eral hours in the \" bois de Boulogne,\" Avhich ansAvers in some re spects to our Hyde-park. From three till six o'clock, the champs Elis^es, through which the road runs, leading to this favourite spot, and all the adjoining streets have been crowded every day during this Aveek, Avith carriages of all de scriptions. Berlins, chariots, curricles, gigs, ca briolets, sociables, &c. These united to innu merable horsemen and pedestrians, make the whole city assume a lively appearance. The bois de Boulogne is about a mile and a half from the place de la Concorde; and the avenue and turnpike leading to it, form one of the most striking entrances of Paris. The Avood itself was formerly very line ; but in one of the frantic moments of revolutionary violence, great"], [200, "176 LETTER XXI. part of the trees, were, by order of the theil government, cut down for fuel. It is however still a very pleasant retreat ; and though the Avood is not so well garnished as it once was, yet it is singularly retired and romantic, for a spot so near a capital. A gate leads to it, where, from the crowds pressing forwards, it is often necessary to wait before it is possible to pass. A string of carriages fills the centre of the road, on the sides of Avhich, gentlemen and ladies on horseback arc obliged to range themselves, as there is no sepa rate space for equestrians. Under the trees, to the right, it is the fashion to walk, or to sit on chairs, which are placed there for the purpose; Avhile ice, oranges, flowers, fruit, and lemonade, are offered by persons, who make it their busi ness to attend, and who are not a little importu nate. Here the belles of Paris appear in all their eclat, not dressed in rustic straw hats, and snow white morning gowns, such as our fair countrywomen wear in Kensington gardens ; and Avhich, 'while they are the emblem of their minds, pure and simple, ave the most becoming orna ments they could assume. The ladies of Paris disdain such humble attractions ; and in showy silks, embroidered muslins, pearl necklaces, lace caps, and transparent petticoats, challenge the attention of passengers. \" Les pommes , d'al batre,\" as Voltaire describes them, are as little disguised as at the halts, Avhich I have mentioned ;"], [201, "LETTER XXI. 177 and ill-nature has a fair opportunity, df determin ing by day light, Avhether they owe their fairness to nature or to art. Clad in this manner, many of them appear in open carriages, while others lounge on the chairs, or loiter along the Avaik, followed by their booted, beaux, Avho to english leather breeches and boots, ancl cropped hair, sometimes add a pair of earrings, or a smart military cocked hat, when the sun shines in all its meridian heat. The mixture of english and french fashions is, indeed, very curious at Paris; and Avhenever a frenchman Avishes to be completely ci Vanglaist, he generally contrives to make himself ridiculous. The equestrians sit on tbe necks of their horses, and turn out their toes, by Avay of imitating our manlier of riding ; and the grooms who attend them, Avhom they call \" des jockes,\" are dressed like our postilions; that is to say, in short Avaist coats, richly laced Avith gold and silver, Avith a cap, ornamented in the same manner, and Avith out any coat. The horses, generally speaking, are very bad, very ill trimmed, and worse mana ged. There are some handsome english carriages already arrived, and the french coachmakers copy our fashions as much as possible ; but they are, as yet, far behind. The common run of A'ehicles is very indifferent. The handsomest equipage from London, loses much of its elegance here, from the slovenly manner in which it is sure to be x"], [202, "178 LETTER XXI. kept by a french coachman ; from the tail of the latter, Avhich it is very difficult to persuade him to cut off ; and from the shabby horses, usually fur nished by the jobmen. Apropos, a very ridicu lous circumstance occurred a feAV days ago. All foreigners are permitted (notAvithstanding the re publican prohibition to natives) to have arms on their carriages, and to give their usual liveries: of course, several of the english, allowed their servants to Avear gold laced cocked hats. Would you believre it possible, that the government Avas apprehensiAre of these hats being taken for the badges, given to distinguish the constituted au thorities; and that, on this ground, they have been forbidden by an express order of the police, issued with proper solemnity? Such is the simple truth. French generals, those renoAvned and dis tinguished Avarriors, are apprehensive of english footmen being taken for them. What a strange littleness in great minds. \" Tant\u00e6ne animis c\u0153lestibus ir\u00e6?\" I cannot help exclaiming Avith lord Chesterfield, \" alas^ poor human nature!\" I beg your pardon for this digression. I re turn to the bois de Boulogne ; Avhen the day is fine, the promenade is very lively ; and the gro tesque figures produced by the unnatural union of french finery, and ehgiish simplicity, serve to distinguish it from every thing else of the kind in Europe. In returning from this motley sce\u00bbe, at"], [203, "LETTER XXt. 179 four o'clock to day, I heard the sound of cannon I I learnt soou after, with inexpressible joy, that the news of the signature of the definitive treaty was just arrived.

It grieves me to add, that this important intelligence has produced no effect at Paris. It has scarcely been mentioned in society, and I have Avalked about, the Avhole eA-ening, admiring the taste Avith which the public buildings Avere lighted ; and heartily joining in the satisfaction Avhich occasioned them, Avithout meeting one single group of french spec tators. Indifference is \" the order of the day;\" and I really believe, that no subject of any kind could animate the parisians, or rouse them from the stupid apathy, into Avhich they have fallen, on the subject of politics. If \" spectacles\" have lost their attraction, it is in vain to try any other method; for these are the \" penates\" of the inhabitants of this great city. I hope and trust, that the peace will be received in England, in a very different manner. All good men Avill unite in rejoicing at the termination of a war, Avhich, Avhether \"just and necessary,\" as some assert, or Avantonly undertaken as others M 2"], [204, "180 LETTER XXI. represent, Avas attended Avith such an unusual waste of public money, private happiness, and human blood.

MY DEAR SIR, 1 WENT yesterday to see the palace of the Luxembourg, iioav appropriated to the use of the conservative senate, originally the residence of monsieur, the king's brother; and afterwards that of the executive directory. The building is now undergoing a thorough repair. It is therefore impossible to judge of it properly, in its present state.

I vieAved it Avith particular pleasure; as the college at Ox ford, Avhere I passed some of the happiest days of my life, and to which I have still the honour of belonging, Avas built after the model of this cele brated palace. This circumstance recalled so many interesting remembrances, that I with diffi culty tore myself from the gates of the Luxem bourg. I am told, that the proposed alterations are to be made on a great and extended scale; and that every member of the senate, is to have here, a distinct house, or spacious apartment. she gardens are also to receive every possible im- n3"], [206, "182 LETTER XXII. provement.

The ground is indeed too much surrounded Avith houses, even to make Avhat we should call in England, a fine garden. The magnificent theatre, called, \" le theatre frangais de l'Odeon,\" Avhich formerly stood near the Luxembourg, and which Avas one ofthe most magnificent buildings of the kiud in Europe, Avas, a few years ago, entirely burnt doAvn, in the course of eight and forty hours. Nothing re mains but the stone front, Avhich the fire could not destroy, and Avhich still serves to ornament this part of the town. Being in the neighbourhood of St. Gen&viboe, iioav called, \"the Pantheon,\" I ordered my coach man to drive there. St. Genevieve appears nearly in the same state, in Avhich I saw it, eleven years since; that is to say, quite unfinished. Though the interior is still Far from having attained that point of perfection, proposed in the original plan, yet it is even in its present situation, very beautiful. As to the exterior, it is strikingly magnificent. Twenty two Corinthian pillars form the portico ; eighteen of them are 54 feet high. There is a cupola"], [207, "183 LETTER XXIt. above, Avhere it Avas intended to have placed a figure of Fame, 28 feet high; but this plan has never been carried into execution. At the ex tremity of this cupola, there is a gallery raised 166 french feet from the surface of the ground, whence Ave enjoyed a most extensive vieAv of Paris. This is the best point, from Avhich the toAvn can be seen: and, as there is not here, as in London, that kind of mist Avhich arises from coal fires, the view Avas uninterrupted. I clearly distinguished from this spot, all the public build ings; and nearly every private house in Paris. It is, in short, a kind of real panorama. The ascent to the gallery is uncommonly easy, up a flight of stone steps, well lighted, and kept in such order, that I have not seen any stairs so clean, since I haA'e been an inhabitant of this great city. The front, which has not suffered at all, during the revolution, has the folloAving words Avritten in large letters, over the principal porch. \u00ab' AUX GRANDS HOMMES, LA PATRIE RECONNOISSANTE *.\" From the scaffoldings erected in different parts of the church, I was led to believe, that orders had been given for the immediate completion of the original plan.

Paris, april the 10th, 1802, (20 germinal.) MY DEAR SIR, ON thursday last, the legislative body, after a speech from Lucien Bonaparte, brother of the consul ; Avho, as orator of the tribunate, very eloquently defended this favourite measure of government ; ratified and approved the concordat with the Pope, by a large majority. The rer establishment of religion is therefore determined. I was not present on the occasion ; but persons capable of judging, assure me, that Lucien's de liA^ery Avas remarkably good; and that his speech was the finest heard in France, since the time of Mirabeau. As it will, of course, appear in the Moniteur, I shall not attempt to copy any of those imperfect statements which are, already, handed about. Madame Bonaparte held, the same day, for the first time, a kind of court : that is to say, a card, being previously sent round by the prefect of the palace, who ansAvers to our master of the ceremonies, saying, that madame Bonaparte Avould,"], [213, "189 LETTER XXIII. at three o'clock, receive the -wives of foreign ministers; and \" des 6trangers de marque, \" such ladies as Avished to be presented, accompanied their respective ambassadors, at the appointed time, to the palace of the Thuilleries. As Mrs. was of the number, you may depend on the account, Avhich I shall now send you. The ladies Avere not in hoops or lappets ; but Avere, in other respects, as much dressed as they Avould haA'e been at St. James's. They were received by the Avise of the prefect du palais, in the apart ments appropriate to madame Bonaparte. She and the first consul, soon after appeared. A circle Avas then formed, and the consul walked round. In passing, he spoke to each lady with much politeness. Madame Bonaparte went through the same ceremony; and at last, seated herself, desiring her guests to folloAv her example. She talked again to those, Avho happened to be near her; and, after an interval of a feAV minutes, she rose, courtesied, thanked the ladies for the honour they had done her, and then retired. I under stood that she behaved Avith great propriety. Her manners were simple, easy, and unaffected. She was polite to eA'ery one; ancl particularly civil to the english. Her apartments, on the ground floor, looking on the Thuilleries, are not large; but they are furnished Avith elegance, and con siderable taste. Her footmen Avere splendidly dressed in green liveries; laced with gold; and"], [214, "190 LETTER XXni. they, as -weft as the \" valets de chambre,\" Avho waited in the antichamber, were particularly civil, respectful, and attentive. There Avere no foreign men present, excepting the ambassadors, and the prince of Orange; but it is understood, that she Avill soon have a drawing-room, for the purpose of receiving such strangers, as are desirous of being introduced. I shall conclude this letter, Avith a short ac count of the opera, from which I am just returned. The house was uncommonly croAvded, on account of the first appearance this season, of the dancer Dehayes. This favourite performer, having been absent more than a year, in consequence of a fall, which rendered him incapable, during that time, of pursuing his profession, Avas received Avith every possible honour. A ballet, called \" le Retour de Zephyr*,\" Avas composed on the occa sion ; and the light and gentle Zephyr Avas Avel comed Avith loud and repeated applauses. His strength is not quite restored; but it is easy to see, that he is no mean proficient in the art of dancing.

Paris, april 13th, 1802 (24 germinal). MY DEAR SIR, 1 WENT yesterday, Avith a small party of english friends, to Versailles, and am just returned. I sit down noAv to give you. the details of our little excursion. We stopped at St. Cloud, Avhich is situate about half Avay, to vieAv that favourite palace of the unfortunate Lewis XVI, Avhich Avill long be celebrated in history, on account of the ex traordinary meeting held there by the council of five hundred, in the orangerie, or green house, which ended in the establishment of the present consular government. St. Cloud is undergoing a thorough repair, previously to its being inhabited by Bonaparte. Itis difficult, therefore, to form a proper estimate, either of Avhat it formerly Avas, or of Avhat it may become. I do not suppose it ever could have been on a very large scale. The gallery, which still remains, is a fine room, and the vieAv is ex tensive from the large windoAv, by which it is terminated. The walls are ornamented Avith some"], [217, "LETTER XXIV. 19^ excellent paintings (I believe) by \" lc Brun.\" The chapel is now in a state of disorder, and I did not examine the pictures which it Contains. The garden has been neglected, and can never have been either very extensive, or A'ery beauti ful. Formal Avalks, and regular rows of trees, constitute all its merit. As to the famous jets d'eau, or cascades, they are still in high preserva tion ; and the Parisians, on a particular day in every year, come here, in splendid procession, to enjoy this favourite sight. I only saw unmoved stone dragons, Neptunes, frogs, swans, and g.if* funs, from Avhose mouths these artificial water falls are vomited. In this state, at least, a jet d'eau forms but a disagreeable ornament in a garden, which ought to unite every beauty of na ture, and to disdain every other. The next object to St. Cloud, Avhich attracted our attention, Avas the famous manufactory of Sevre. The beautiful porcelain, which bears the name of this town, continues to be made here, under the immediate protection of the govern ment. We visited the shop, or magazin, and Avere shoAvn the several rooms of Avhich it consists. In all of these were tables, covered Avith speci mens of china made here, but I cannot .->ay that they answered my expectation. They Avere neither as various, nor as splendid, as one should suppose they would be, at the principal depot of so re nowned a manufactory. Probably, the situation o"], [218, "194 LETTER XXIV. in which France has been during the revolution, did not afford a sufficient number of purchasers, to induce the managers to keep by them any con siderable quantity of expensive articles. There were several busts of Bonaparte in different sizes, all of which were strikingly resembling. There Avere also gieat and small busts of Voltaire, Franklin, and Rousseau. Going thence to Versailles, avc drove to Rambrand's, which is esteemed the principal hotel; but finding, on our arrival, that the best rooms were engaged, Ave changed our plan, and proceeded to le Petit Trianon in the park, which, formerly the much loved retreat of Marie An toinette, has, in the strange metamorphosis things as Avell as men haA-e experienced in France, be come a common inn. Having ordered dinner to be prepared in a small room, once celebrated as the luxurious boudoir of the ill fated queen, we proceeded to view the curiosities of Versailles. The park has lost some trees, and has been neglected. In other respects, it is not much altered. The orangcrie* still retains, unimpaired, all its * Orangcrie. \u2014 The following description, given by la Fon taine of the same place in his time, is exactly descriptive of its present situation: \" Comme nos gens avoient encore de loisir Us fire nt vn tour d I'orai'geric.

The gardener assured us, that some of those which were of very large dimensions; had been planted in the reign of Francis I. We next visited the private library of the former kings of France, situate in a separate house in the town. There is nothing very par- ticular in the building ; but there were, above the several doors of the library, extremely pretty paintings of the different capitals of Europe. We were here shoAvn a very beautiful collection of illuminated paintings, representing the splendid fetes and tournaments given by the magnificent Lewis XIV. Thence our guide Avished to take us to the national manufactory of fire arms, Avhich is carried on With great activity in this town ; but having seen many acknowledgedly superior works of the same kind in England, Ave declined visiting it, and proceeded at once to the palace.

The magnificent furniture, Avhich the apartments once contained, has been removed ; but the walls are not Avithout ornament, for the palace having been made (probably Avith the view of preserving it from popular violence) a musee central, or dep6t of the Avorks of art, now pos sesses several valuable pictures, and a feAV ex cellent statues. Among the former, I remarked some good Claude Loraines, and two beautiful portraits by Vincent. The subject of one Avas Henry IV of France; and the other, that of the celebrated president, Mole. The latter is painted in his parliamentary robes, heroically exposing his breast to the violence of the mob, and doing his duty, unmoved by the poniards raised against him. You seem to hear him exclaim, as history records he did, \" La distance est grande de la main d'un assassin au c\u0153ur d'un honnfete homme*.\" We walked through the A-ast suite of rooms, Avhich, once the seat of gayety, splendour, luxury, and royal magnificence, are now the abode of solitude, and the monument of fallen grandeur. It is unnecessary to state the many reflections Avhich this spot created. We failed not to visit * The distance is great from the hand nf an assassin to tlie heart of an honest man."], [221, "197 LETTER XXIV. the apartment Avhich the unfortunate Lewis XVI occupied on the 6th of October, and in Avhich Marie Antoinette took refuge. We Avere also shown the balcony Avindow (now stopped up), where that virtuous and ill fated princess, madame Elizabeth, Avith a magnanimity truly heroic, pre sented herself, Avhen the queen Avas called for, and being taken for her, voluntarily subjected herself to all the brutal violence of an irritated mob. We likeAvise saw the opera house, built for the Avedding of Lewis XVI, Avhen dauphin, and which, during the last reign, Avas sometimes used as a theatre, and sometimes as a ball room. The apartment is still perfect, but the scenes and de corations have been removed. On leaving the palace, Ave visited several jets d'eau ; but were prevented from viewing the gar den as particularly as Ave could have wished, a A'iolent shower of rain having overtaken us. Tha Avaterworks and pleasure grounds appear to have been much neglected We dined at the Little Trianon, and slept there.

Our gallantry, however, did not subdue our reason, and we determined to resist the demand. Our hostess having indignantly refused the half, which Ave offered as amply sufficient, Mr. and I proceeded to Versailles, in pursuit of a. j age dc paix. After being sent to two or three justices, Avho told us, that it Avas not within their jurisdic tion, Ave at last, in a miserable lodging, and at an obscure house, fouud the magistrate of the division. His dress and his appearance Avere not superiour to his residence, and from these united circumstances, Ave were far from expecting that justice which, in the result, Ave experienced. Having heard our case, he granted a citation, requiring the attendance of the landlord ; and, of course, suspended his decision till the arrival of the other party. While our servant, Avho carried the summons, a\\ ent to execute it, we Avere pre sent at a curious trial, the subject of which wasa small quantity, I believe a quart, of vinegar. The defendant was a coarse masculine Avoman, at least sixty years of age, who, when she had exhausted all her fund of eloquence, burst into tears, and talked of the weak unprotected state of an un happy Avidow. The plaintiff was a dirty ill look ing fellow, with a witness of no better appearance. They all talked together; and the justice, instead of being able to moderate their violence, found it difficult to gain a hearing himself. After a o 4"], [224, "200 LETTER XXIV. wrangle of an hour, and after swearing and countersAvearing to the same fact, they Avent away, Avithout the business being finally settled. What entertained me much, Avas, that these disputants, in the middle of their harangues, turned round to my friend and me, and seemed anxious, each in his turn, to convince us, by their eloquence, of the justice of their respective cases; though Ave were not only strangers to the business, but also to the laAvs on which this im portant question Avas to be decided. When our good landlady arrived, her bill was produced; and the justice having declared how exorbitant he thought it, she justified herself on three grounds. 1st. That Ave had not made a previous agree ment; and ergo, that she had a right to demand whatever she pleased. 2dly. That she paid a great rent \" a la na tion*;\" and that, therefore, \"la nation\" ought to permit her to make her guests pay a great rent for their lodgings. Sdly. That \" I' ambassadeur de lempereur Rus'sef,\" having lodged at her house only a week before, and not having objected to a charge of two louis per bed, \" les milords angiois\" ought to think her present demand extremely reasonable. * To the natiop. f The ambassador of the emperor of Russia. I"], [225, "201 LETTER XXIA'. Notwithstanding this very able defence, the justice told her, that the law Avould not allow her d'hxorcher les krangers*; and very equitably de creed, that Ave should pay 36 instead of 63 francs. Madame received, very indignantly, the sum al lotted her, and went away in a rage, declaring that, in future, no person should sleep at le petit Trianon, who Avould not bind himself be fore hand to pay the price which \" son excellence 1'ambassadeur de toutes les Russies\" thought so reasonable. So concluded our trial, which I have detailed as characteristic of Avhat is to be expected at inns in France, if prior arrangements be not made by travellers; and likewise as an honourable proof, that justice, though not clad in ermine, is fairly administered. In going away, I Avas not a little surprised to find, that there Avere no costs to pay, and that even the summons had been issued gratuitously. In England, AA'here we possess so admirable a system of JaAvs, how much are its advantages di minished, by the expenses attendant on every process! for, as a distinguished public man once Avell observed, though the temple of justice be open to all, it is like the London tavern, only the favourites of fortune dare approach its threshold. * To fleece strangers."], [226, "202 LETTER XXIA\\ In returning to our inn, Ave passed by the royal stables, which are still kept up, and filled Avith horses. These are noAv appropriated to the use of the officers of the army, Avho come here to be instructed in the menage, and who employ, for this purpose, the quondam riding school of the king. The horses appeared, at least to an english eye, \\-ery indifferent. We also saw here some arabians, lately arrived from Egypt. They are extremely plain, lanky, and awkward ; but the groom assured us, on being asked if they were sAvift, \" Oui, monsieur, comme les oiseaux.\" (\" Yes, sir, as SAvift as birds.\") It Avas in A-ain to object to outward form, Avhen Ave learnt that these animals had the talent of flying. If, ac cording to the old jockey phrase, \" no good horse can have a bad colour,\" certainly no horse Avho flies can be ugly. Before Ave left Versailles, Ave visited the garden of le petit Trianon, Avhich is rented by our honest landlady, and which may be seen, by paying a small sum for a ticket at the gate. It is kept in tolerable order, and has still strong marks of that good taste, with which it was ori ginally made. It is really, and not nominally, an english garden; and would, even in our happy island, he deemed as prettily laid out, as the smallness of its extent Avould permit. The little theatre, built by the. queen, situate Avithin the precincts of these grounds, is still in"], [227, "LETTER XXIA*. 203 existence, and has suffered no loss, excepting that of the beautiful glasses witli which the boxes Avere once splendidly illuminated. The last ob ject, to which we Avere led at Versailles, Avas ''le grand Trianon,\" that favourite spot of Lewis XVI. This elegant building is also unhurt; and the fine marble pillars, which form the entrance, excited all our admiration. The poverty, into which the inhabitants of the town have fallen, in conse quence of the revolution, is strikingly apparent. In every corner, Ave Avere surrounded by half starved and half-naked beggars, whose impor tunities Avere not a little troublesome. In returning to Paris, Ave took the road of St. Germain. The old castle still remains; but its outward appearance Avas so gloomy, that we felt no inclination to visit the interiour. Isthe french monarch intended to pay a compliment to the pretpnder, in giving him a palace as nearly as possible resembling St. James's, his\u00bb choice was admirable. The view from the terrace is pretty, but by no means either as extensive, nor as rich, as I expected from its celebrity. In continuing our road, avc saw the celebrated waterworks of Marly, Avhich are preserved in all their perfection. We likewise passed by the fa mous aqueduct, and by Malmaison. the private spat of the first consul. The latter has nothing very particular to distinguish it. It is simply a moderate sized house, situate near the ri\\rer, but so"], [228, "204 LETTER XXIV. low, that it cannot command a very extensive prospect.

Paris, april the 16th, 1802, (\u00bb7 germinal). MY DEAR SIR, .A.LL Paris has been alive for the last three days. Can you guess the reason? Perhaps you Avill imagine, that the inhabitants, roused from the state of lethargy, into which they have for some time back been plunged, are beginning to give sincere but tardy marks of joy, at the reestablishment of internal order, and external peace. Not at all, my good friend. A subject, much more interest ing to the parisians, is the cause of the show and gayety so generally exhibited. KnoAv, then, that \"Long Champ\" has begun! I must now, like other learned commentators, explain my expla nation. \" Long Champ\" is the name of a village, situate on the other side of the \" Bois de Bou logne,\" of which latter place I spoke to you in a former letter. In this village stood an abbey, or church; and one of the holy fathers, some hun dred years ago, had a voice of such extraordinary"], [230, "206 LETTER XXV. sweetness, that, Avhen high mass Avas performed, crowds of Parisians flocked to hear him. His popularity Avas not confined to the lower class, and the noblesse shared the curiosity of the public. The fashion of going to Long Champ so rapidly increased, that, in a short time, it Avas no uncommon thing to see whole strings of splen did carriages at the door of the convent. The road to this village became the favourite ride, and vanity soon discovered, that it afforded an excellent opportunity of displaying all the va rieties of dress, and all the pomp of equipage. In the course ofa few 3'ears, it became an esta blished custom, at this particular period of the year, to make, during three days, not an humble pilgrimage, but a splendid procession, to Long Champ. The mass and the singer were soon forgotten ; but the promenade continued, and increased every year in the magnificence of pa rade. To appear, on this occasion, Avith becom ing grandeur, the haughty, but often distressed noble, Avould, for months beforehand, deprive himself of his ordinary comforts. To rival ''les dames de bonne compagnie*\" in richness of dress, in show of equipage, and blaze of dia monds, Avas the grand object of the admired belles of the opera house; and the means of * \" Ladies of good company,\" or, as. we should say in eng lish, women of character."], [231, "207 LETTER XXV. doing so, was the exacted price of those smiles, Avhich the well benesiced prelate, or the Avealthy financier, were sometimes permitted to enjoy. The Bourgeois and their wives appeared in their humble cabriolets, but the forma- Wdfe their sunday apparel; and the latter were loaded Avith all the tinsel finery, which, during the course of the year, they had been able to collect. The common people, or la canaille (as they Avere then indignantly called), Avere equally fond of this procession ; and, at the risk of being run over, crowded and completed the show, some dressed in tattered regimentals, some in faded silk coats, and ragged embroidered waistcoats, and others with baer-Avig-s and wooden shoes. Such Avas the custom during \" l'ancien regime.\" The amusements of the french vanished with their old political institutions, and \" horrendum dictu,\" Long Champ Avas long unobserved. Robespierre, and after him the directors, for bade every thing Avhich bore the least resemblance to the customs of former times; but when Bona parte came into power, the system Avas instantly changed, and the people, left to follow their own inclinations, greedily returned to all their former diversions. \" Long Champ\" was of the number; aud, since the 18th of brumaire, it has been gra dually recovering its ancient magnificence. This year, from the reestablishment of peace, and the"], [232, "208 LETTER XXV. confluence of foreigners, it Avas expected to bd finer than eA'er ; and vast preparations have, during some weeks past, been making. Mil liners tortured their fancy to invent new fashions; mantuamakers passed whole nights without sleep, in executing; the orders which thev had reeei\\'ed; coachmakers exerted themselves Avith all the art of their trade, and all the vanity of their country, in endeavouring to imitate the carriages of the english; horses Avere sent for from every part of the world; regiments of tailors were employed in making coats for the beaux, habits for the ladies, and laced jackets for their grooms; strings of boots Avere seen dano-ling- on the backs of porters in every quarter of ihe town ; saddles Avere as much in requisition, as if a great military project, by the means of cavalry, had been in agitation; and I have been confidently assured, that no less than three thousand pair of leather breeches Avere ordered on the occasion. In consequence of these active preparations, and of \" Long Champ\" having been, for some Aveeks back, infinitely more the subject of con versation than either the peace, or the reesta blishment of religion, I expected, at least, a very brilliant sight. I must say, I was disappointed. The only thing wliich pleased me very much, was the bustle which it produced in the town, and the gayety with Avhich it animated the faces of the Parisians. For three daAs, even' vehicle in the"], [233, "209 LETTER XXAr. shape of a carriage, and every animal Avhich claimed the name of horse, has been dragged into use, ancl become part of the procession. About tAvo o'clock, a military guard Avas posted at the beginning of the Champs Elisees, to pre serve order, (for nothing here is done without soldiers) ; and from that hour, till some time after sunset, the crowd gradually increased. At three, the line of carriages rfeached from \" la place de la Concorde\" to the \" Bois de Boulogne ;\" and, of course, there Avere frequent stoppages, even at the beginning of the promenade. The road not employed in this manner, Avas filled Avith equestrians of all ranks, and the Avalk on both sides Avas equally thronged with passengers on foot. There Avere some feAV elegant english equi pages, Avell appointed, and others spoiled, by the shabby appearance of the servants, or the ex treme badness of the horses. The french coach makers, in one or two instances, successfully imi tated the fashions of London ; but, generally speaking, the attempt only served to prove the vast distance which exists, between the two coun tries, in the art of constructing carriages. Mixed Avith \" les voitures a I' anglaise, ou veritablement anglaises*\" Were seen old fashion ed berlins, family coaches, and superannu- * Carriages in the english fashion, or carriages really english.

Among the horsemen Avere seen a few returned emigrants, Avho had so well copied the dress of our young men of ton, that they might have been mistaken for the beaux of Bond street; but the greater number (malgre their leather breeches and boots, their blue frocks and high croAvned hats) betrayed the forgery, by the preposterous addition of ear-rings, coloured capes, or pointed toes. The ladies appeared in every variety of clothing. Some, avIio ventured to be their oavu charioteers, assumed the neat and ap- propriate dress of an \" amazone,\" or habit. Others, decorating, and concealing as little as possible, the charms of their person, shone in all the brilliance of their evening apparel. Worked gowns, laced caps, and sIioavv turbans, Avere sometimes exhibited from the AvindoAvs of hack- ney coaches ; and a dirty buggy had, not unfre- quently, the honour of conveying three or four damsels, Avhose costume would not have been unsuited to the first heroine of the stage. It is impossible to describe, or convey, the faintest idea of the grotesque figures which appeared on this occasion ; ancl, notwithstanding the trouble and expense to Avhich so many individuals had exposed themselves, by the purchase of neAV car riages, new liveries, new horses, new dresses, and last, not least, new leather breeches, the 5"], [235, "LETTER XXA-j 211 Avhole appeared to me but a shabby exhibition, and dull amusement. Moving, in slow procession, to the other side of the Bois de Boulogne, during five or six hours, constituted the Avhole pleasure of this vaunted fete. There Avere certainly some elegant carriages, ancl some handsome horses ; but the number Avas too inconsiderable to make amends for the crowd of those of a contrary description. Nothing: could be more tiresome than sitting: in one of these A'ehicles, as they Avere compelled, every instant, to stop, ou account of the length ened line, which increased every moment. Per sons on horseback Avere squally ill off, as it re quired the utmost care to avoid being driven against the wheels of the carriages ; and as for the pedestrians, they Avere almost buried in a volley of dust. Such is the celebrated promenade of Long- Champ, which, though an annual festival, ap pears to me a wretched ancl pitiful imitation of Hyde park ou an ordinary Sunday. Yet the french are delig-hted with their amusement; and in returning this evening, I heard on every side, \" Quel beau spectacle ! quelles jolies voitures ! queis magnifiques cheA'aux! quelle belle parure !

It is not a little flattering to the vanity of an englishman, to see hoAV rapidly the french are adopting our fashions ; and, notwithstanding the aAvkward manner in which they are sometimes copied, yet such is the general bias, that I enter tain no doubt that, in the space of ten years, (isthe peace should last so long), it Avill become almost impossible to distinguish, by his dress, a native of France from one of England. The ladies of Paris, ancl those of London, differ, indeed, very widely in their toilet. Per haps they might reciprocally improve by observ ing each other ; and Avhile the former Avould do right to respect and imitate the modesty, Avith which the latter are usually clad, our fair country- Avomen might also, Avithout any injury to their beauty, or any violation of that delicacy, which is their brightest ornament, adopt some of that taste, elegance, and fancy, Avhich are often seen in the dress of a well bred frencliAvoman.

Paris, april the 18th, i8p2, Easter Sunday (i8 germinal.) MY DEAR SIR, 1 O day Avill probably be long remembered in the annals of France, on account of the promul gation of the laAV for (\" I' 6/ablissement des cultes\") the reestablishment of religion ; on account of the definitive treaty of peace with England, the ratifications of Avhich Avere ex changed this morning at the Thuilleries ; and of the \" Te Deum\" sung at Notre Dame, in honour of these united events. I wished very much to be present at a cere mony, Avhich was rendered so particularly inter esting by the number of curious concurring circumstances, too obvious to be detailed. Hav ing no ticket, I Avent to the church at six o'clock in the morning, hoping to make my Avay, among the crowd, into those places, which were not appropriated to the constituted authorities. The doors Avere not open ; and about a hundred persons, avIio Avere already arrived, stood enclosed in a kind of barrier, which seemed to have been p 3"], [238, "214 LETTER XXVI. put up for the purpose of preventing too great a press at the first opening of the gates. I placed myself against this bar, and hoped to gain admittance in the second division. I Avas soon folloAved ancl surrounded by a considerable crowd; ancl, after Ave had all remained about two hours in this uncomfortable state, a detachment of sol diers arrived, ancl attempted instantly to clear a passage. We Avere already so squeezed together, that it was impossible to make room for the mili tary, Avithout either losing our places, or incur ring the danger of suffocation. When the sol diers perceived that, notwithstanding the blows which they dealt around them Avithout ceremony, the people did not immediately make Avay, they lost all patience ; and, not content with fixing their bayonets, called out for a detachment of horse. The brandishing of the one, and the fear of the other, soon dispersed the mob ; but not till some had been Avouuded, and seA'eral se verely bruised. I could not help reflecting, with some degree of indignation, on this singular scene. In Eng land, under a monarchical form of government, the military are not allowed to interfere, but in cases of positiAre danger, or actual insurrection ; and even then under the orders of a civil magis trate. In France, Avhere the system is called \" republican,\" ancl every man supposed to con stitute a part of the sovereignty, the body of the"], [239, "LETTER XXVI. 215 people, coming quietly to see the first solemn ser vice of that religion, which is said to be restored in compliance with their Avishes, are driAren Avith blows ancl military violence from the doors of that church, in which peace, liberty, equality, and good order, are about to be celebrated. Per haps, indeed, it may be urged, that this Avas only a necessary precaution ofthe police, and that the object of the guard Avas to prevent that riot and danger to Avhich the public, not so protected, Avould have been exposed. The ansAver is plain. If it Avas thought necessary to maintain order by the assistance of the military poAver, the sentinels ought to have been placed the preceding night, or at the dawn of morning. It Avas adding insult to cruelty, to permit the people to assemble, and after the loss of several hours, ancl the endurance of great fatigue, to dismiss them in the manner I have described. It is needless for me to say, that I soon relin quished all hope of getting into the church, and thought myself happy in being able to make my escape unhurt from the claws of these heroes. In going aAvay, I perceived at the Avindow of an adjoining hospital, nearly opposite the church, some ladies of my acquaintance, who Avere sc> obliging. as to offer me a place near them, from which I might see the procession. I had scarcely taken this situation, when a ticket for one of the privileged places in the p 4"], [240, "216 LETTER XXA-*. church was given me by a person, Avho was un willing: to risk the difficulties, Avith which the approach to the doors seemed attended. After being sent about to different gates, I at last found admittance at one. When I reached the gallery, it Avas so completely full, that I found myself compelled to take refuge in the orchestra. From this situation I Avas again dih-en by the sol diers ; and in despair I returned to the gallery, where, standing on the back of a tottering chair, and Avith at least twenty ioavs of spectators before me, I caught, not Avithout some danger, a very imperfect glimpse of this splendid ceremony. What I did not see myself, I shall relate on the authority of persons, A\\rho Avere more fortu nately situate, and on Avhose accuracy I know I can depend. The procession began with a numerous escort of different regiments. Among these Avere par ticularly remarked \" les guides,\" a corps of handsome young men, clad in hussar dresses, and mounted on beautiful horses, Avho excited universal admiration. Next to them came the \"gens d'armes,\" or \"regiment d' elites,\" lately raised. They are men of a very respectable ap pearance, in blue uniforms, faced with yelloAV, Avhence long epaulets are suspended. These, as Avell as the buttons, are of silver, as is the lace of their hats. Their horses are black. The con sular guards, and several regiments of the line,"], [241, "217 LETTER XXVI. completed the military cavalcade. The ministers of state, and the \"corps diplomatique,\" came next, ancl formed a long; line of carriages. Those of the latter Avere drawn each by four horses, and ornamented with all the escutcheons of heraldic pomp. Those of the former were without arms ; but they had all six horses, and their servants, dressed alike, wore splendid liveries, now put on for the first time, of yellow, gold, and red. A small corps of Mamalukes in their egyptian costume, some of Avhom led unmounted arabians, and a few aides-de-camp, immediately preceded the carriage, in which sat Bonaparte, accom panied by the other two consuls. His coach, new on the occasion, Avas simply elegant, and drawn by eight very fine horses richly capari soned. His serA'ants appeared in green coats and red Avaistcoats, on all the seams of which Avere toavs of broad gold lace. The consuls Avere received at the door of the church hy the arch bishop of Paris, who placed over their head a dais (or canopy). Bonaparte, Avith Cambaccres on his right, ancl le Brun on his left hand, Avas conducted in this manner to a throne erected near the altar, under which their three chairs Avere placed. A similar throne appeared opposite, in which sat the car dinal legate. The bishops^bowed first to the altar, secondly to the consuls, and lastly to the cardinal. This"], [242, "218 LETTER XXVT. Avas remarked by the public ; as, under the mo narchy, the representative of the pope Avas per mitted to receive this homage before the sovereign of the country. The oath settled by the concordat having been taken by the clergy, high mass Avas instantly said. At the conclusion of this ceremony, M. de Boisgelin, formerly archbishop of Aix, lately named archbishop of Thoulouse, ascended the pulpit, ancl delivered a discourse appropriate to the occasion. I regretted much, that the dis tance at Avhich I Avas placed Avas so great, that it Avas impossible for me to hear the vene rable preacher, Avho excited no little curiosity, from the singularity of his situation. He is the same man, Avho, at the \" sacre\" or coronation, of Lewis XVI, preached in the same pulpit, before that unfortunate monarch. His sermon will, no doubt, be published in the \" moniteur,\" where you Avill haA'e an opportunity of seeing it. It Avas the custom formerly on these occasions, for the bishop, in beginning his discourse, to address himself to the king. A similar form was observed to day, ancl the expression of \"sire'' was ex changed for that of '\u25a0' citoyen premier consul.\" After the, sermon, \" Te Deum\" Avas chanted. All the band of the opera house Avas employed, and Lais and madame Bolla supplied the vocal parts. The effect Avas fine, yet, comparatively, very inferiour to our musical meetings in Westminster"], [243, "LETTER XXVI. 219 abbey. I heard some connoisseurs object to the. air, as not sufficiently grave or dignified for the subject Avhich it was intended to celebrate. As I am totally ignorant of music, I can form no judgment as to the justice of the criticism. The churcli was immensely full. The aisle was filled Avith the military, the different uniforms of Avhich had a splendid effect. Behind the consuls sat the ambassadors, the ministers, and the generals. In a box above, at the entrance of the chapel, Avas placed madame Bonaparte, ac companied by her daughter and some other ladies. On the other side Avas a similar box, appropriate to the use of the ladies of the \" corps diplomatique.\" The tAvo galleries or choirs, Avhich surround the church, were divided into an orchestra for the music, seats for the different constituted authorities, and places for such individuals as Avere favoured Avith tickets. In the latter Avere of course seen all the persons at Paris most dis tinguished for situation, talent, or beauty. The coup d'\u0153il altogether was very striking. The procession returned Avith the same ceremony as that in Avhich it arrived ; ancl all the streets of Paris Avere lined Avith spectators. A discharge of sixty cannon.

In the evening, the palace was splendidly illu minated. Every division of the arches forming the front toAvards the garden Avas covered with lamps, and a lustre of lights Avas suspended from each. The garden itself Avas prettily, but less brilliantly, decorated, than on the fete in honour of the preliminaries. All the public buildings and offices Avere also lighted; but the only illumination at all remark able, beside those Avhich I have named, Avas that of Mr. Jackson, his majesty's envoy extra ordinary. The gates of \" l'hotel de Caramon,\" where he lodges, Avere entirely covered Avith lamps of different colours; the effect of which was much admired, as at Paris that mode of decorating their rejoicings is unknoAvn. On the right hand Avere the letters R. F. (Ripublique Francaise); and on the left, G. R. (Georgius Rex). I forgot to mention that Bonaparte Avas much applauded by the populace, in going to Notre Dame; and that madame received the same com pliment, though she Avent there without any pa rade, in a plain handsome carriage, and seemed to decline, rather than to court, the notice of the public. During the illuminations there Avas no noise, ancl, indeed, no expression of joy. Very few people Avere seen in the Thuilleries, though the weather Avas fine, and the day sunday. The"], [245, "221 LETTER XXVI. more I see of the french, the more am I asto nished ancl disgusted at the indifference which they have contracted.

Palais de Justice. \u2014 Account of the different tribunals or courts of law. Paris, aprilthe 30th, 1802, (10 florea!.) MY DEAR SIR, I WENT this morning to the \" Palais de Jus tice,\" in order to visit the different tribunals. The \"facade,\" or front, of this building has a commanding appearance. A handsome iron rail ing, Avith three gates, forms its barrier ; after passing through which, you ascend a lofty flight of stone steps. The avenues to the principal hall are filled with shops of various descriptions, ancl particularly those of booksellers. The hall, or central room, which is of considerable extent, forms a kind of antichamber to the diffeient courts. I Avent into one of the \" tribunals de premier instance,\" in each of which three judges preside. They Avear long bands, ancl black coats, from Avhich is suspended a cloke or gown of black silk. The advocates plead in a sort of bar ; but, excepting being dressed in black, have no distinguishing badge, or professional decoration. The judges had a grave appearance; and, though they did not seem to be men of much import ance, conducted themselves with decency and"], [247, "223 LETTER XXVII. propriety. I Avas present Avhile some causes were argued; but they Avere not of sufficient consequence to enable me to form any estimate of the talents of the advocates, now called, in the general change of name, \" des defenseurs officiaux*.\" As to their outward garb, it Avas not prepossessing ; and, if it Avere not unjust to form any conclusion from mere exteriors, I should say, that a french counsel and an english one appear to be drawn from a very different class of society. I next saw a court, whieh, under the title of \"tribunal de la police correc tionelle,\" is charged with the investigation ancl punishment of petty offences. I here heard the trial of a man charged with pawning, for his OAvn use, some goods belonging to a shop, in Avhich he was employed as a workman. The witnesses Avere regularly examined ; after which the criminal Avas very patiently heard in his defence. As he had nothing to urge but his poverty and the charges of a large family, he Avas found guilty by the judges, (for I observed no jury) and Avas sentenced, though an old offender, to only six months imprisonment. \u25a0 This trial having satis fied my curiosity about \" la police correc tionelle,\" I next visited the chief or supreme court of the republic, Avhich is called \" le tri bunal de cassation.\" Here every thing bore a * Official defenders."], [248, "224 LETTER XXVIT. more dignified appearance. The room was lofty, the seats elevated, and the judges (whose number Avas considerable) seemed, by their dress, their manner, ancl their language, to be Avell suited to the important functions of their office. They wore black and red gowns, Avith cocked hats, the cords of which Avere of gold lace. Nothing can be more respectable than the exterior of this court; of the proceedings of which I could form no idea, as the judges were employed in reading papers relating to mere matters of form. I imagine, that this is the tribunal intended, in some respects, to replace the parliament of Paris. The magistrates, as far as I could form an opinion from this cursory visit, seem men of education, learning, and polished manners. Before I left the Palais de Justice, I looked in at the criminal court of the \" department de Seine.\" A culprit Avas reading a long written defence, which I had not the patience to hear concluded. The room Avas handsome, and the proceedings orderly and correct. I saw here nothing like a jury ; yet I am told, that all capital offences are tried by that mode of pro cess. An Italian Avas a few days ago tried in this court, and convicted of assassination. I regret much, that I Avas not present at the trial. I did not hear of the circumstance till to day. He yesterday underwent the punish-"], [249, "225 LETTER XXVII. ment of the guillotine, being led to the scaffold in a red shirt, this disgrace being added to the sentence in cases of murder. I ought to men tion, in honour of the present criminal laAvs of France, that this is the first individual, who has been condemned to death, during the six months which I have passed at Paris. Underneath the \" Palais de Justice\" is situ ate that fatal prison, called \" la Conner gerie.\" It Avas here that the sanguinary Robespierre immured the daily victims of his wild and unre lenting tyranny; who awaited, Avithin its dismal Avails, the signal of death, under the insulting and degraded name of trial. It Avas here, that rank, beauty, age, philosophy, virtue, and pa triotism, took the places of vice; and, in the caverns destined to receive the blackest perpe trators of hideous crimes, were hurled, among multitudes of other innocent and dignified cha racters, the learned Condorcet, the ingenious Lavoisier, the respectable Madame Roland, the venerable Malesherbes, and the lovely, coura geous, ancl once haughty queen of France. When I haAre been forced to make such painful reflections, in viewing the different ob jects Avhich present themselves at Paris, I have ahvays found some consolation in looking round me, and seeing Iioav completely that system of suspicion, bloodshed, and injustice, has passed aAvay, Those horrors, so disgraceful to France, Q"], [250, "226 LETTER XXVII. took place in a moment of national delirium sis I may be permitted the expression) ; ancl the inhabitants of Paris, avIio committed, or rather suffered, the scenes of judicial murder, which every day contaminated the streets ofthe capital, noAv, restored to their senses, are the first to, deplore and execrate them.

Paris, may the ad, I?0\u00bb (li florcaQ. MY DEAR SIR, W HENEVER you come to Paris, come Avith the smiling month of may. On my arrival here, at the end of October, I was disgusted Avith the dirt of the streets, the mire of the Thuilleries, the ruts of the Boulevards, and the general gloom of the town. Accustomed, to take a great deal of exercise, I could not persuade myself to be shut up, the Avhole of every day, either in hot room, or a close carriage. I therefore con tinued to Avalk about: but, while my feet were cut to pieces at every step, I was frequently in danger of being run over by a rapid cabriolet, or squeezed to atoms under the ponderous Avheels of an overloaded cart. Nor Avas I consoled for this hazardous undertaking by meeting with any conversable persons of my acquaintance. The parisians, Avho have carriages, never think of walking during the severe days of Avinter; ancl those Avho do not possess that convenience,, spend the greater part of every day at home. To save the expense of a fiacre *, they will. * Hackney coach- 0. 2"], [252, "228 LETTER XXVIII. indeed, sometimes use their feet in going to a restaurateur's, a spectacle, or a ball, or in pay ing some of those innumerable visits, in Avhich an inhabitant of this toAvn passes half his life ; but, as to taking exercise for health, it never enters into the calculations of a frenchman. Nothing, therefore, could be so dismal as the streets in the months of november, december, and Janu ary; and a severer punishment could not be de vised for the daily murder of time committed by our Bond street loungers, than to condemn them to a three months pilgrimage, at that period of the year, round the streets of Paris. The spring has, with fine Aveather, changed the face of every thing here ; and a person fond of exercise may now have all the advantages which he can possibly desire. The Thuilleries and Champs Elisees, which in Avinter are almost impassable, noAv offer ex cellent gravel walks, and delightful shade under the long avenues of lofty trees. Here croAvds are collected at almost eA'ery hour of the day ; and, besides long lines of pedestrians, toavs of chairs are filled with ladies eating ice, and poli ticians reading neAvspapers. The Bois de Boulogne affords an admirable ride for persons in carriages or on horseback, and a lengthened Avalk for those on foot. Besides these, there are several delightful gar dens open to the public in different parts of the"], [253, "LETTER XXVITI. 229 .town. The Boulevards, Avhich surround Paris on every side, are noAv seen to great advantage. The walks are in high order, the trees are in rich foliage ; and the number of mountebanks, printsellers, quack doctors, and shows of all kinds, collected here, and the croAvds of persons and carriages Avhich are constantly passing, make them present a A'ery curious ancl lively scene. The \" Hameau de Chantilly,\" or Elisee de Bourbon, A'ery near the Champs Elis\u00a3es, has a very pretty, though not an extensive garden, into Avhich, for a few sols, you gain admittance. It Avas hence I saw madame Garnerin ascend, about a month ago, in a balloon, unaccompanied by any one. The day was fine; and Ave were all much delighted Avith the courage of the fair heroine, Avho Avas the first female that had ven tured alone on such an expedition. She descended a few leagues from Paris, and supped, the same evening, in public, at the Hameau, Avhere she Avas received with universal and merited applause. I am particularly pleased with a garden, called \" Mousseux, ou les dilices' de Chartre,\" situate in the Fauxbourg St. Honore, and within the gates of Paris. It formerly belonged to the duke of Orleans ; but, having been confiscated with the rest of his enormous fortune, is now national property, ancl open every day for the use of the q3"], [254, "230 LETTER XXVIII. public. The garden is arranged in the english taste, commands an extensive vieAv, and has all the advantages and appearance of grounds at a considerable distance from n capital. Fine ver dure, trees of every kind in the most luxuriant blossom, variety of floAvers, a clear sky, and birds warbling a thousand wild notes, make you entirely forget the toAvn ; and the Avhole seems a fairy scene produced by enchantment. The only things in bad taste, I mean the mo dern antiques and draAvbridges, are noAv falling into decay ; and the artificial ruins are daily becoming real ones. The salon or house consists of a long gallery ; but it has been so much neglected during the reA-olution, that it is iioav in a very tortering and dangerous state. \" Mousseux\" is still a most de lightful spot, and must have been exquisitely so, Avhen kept in proper order. I doubt much, if such a garden is to be found Avithin the Avails of any other capital in Europe. I ought to mention, that, though the town is completely hidden in the shady Avalks of this charming retreat, one of the best views of Paris is enjoyed from a hillock of easy ascent, situate in the centre of these grounds. There is a traiteur at the door of the garden, where dinners may be ordered ; but his accommodations (as far as can be judged from the outward appearance of his"], [255, "LETTER XXVIII. 231 habitation) I should suppose not very superioun I have heard, however, of large ancl fashionable parties, who have dined here. Nothing is paid for walking in the garden. At the further end of the Bois de Boulogne, about tAvo miles from Paris, there is another place of this kind, which, whenever you come to Paris, I recommend your visiting. It is called \"Bagatelle,\" and formerly belonged to the prince de Conde, who is said to have built the house and arranged the grounds in the space of six Aveeks. The building, Avhich is now an inn. or tavern, is light and elegant ; and the garden (allowing for some few exceptions) is laid out with considerable taste. Near the house there is a very pretty and very striking view of the bridge of Neuilly. The accommodations here are good, and a person fond of the country cannot pass a fine eA'ening more agreeably, than by dining at P-o-atelle, and strolling afterwards about the grounds. Before I conclude my account of the gardens of Paris, I ought to mention two, Avhich are opened at this season of the year, at a late hour, and usually frequented after the opera, or other spectacles ; I mean Frescati and Tivoli. Frescati consists of a large house and small garden, situate on the Boulevard. The gate stands in the corn,er of \"la rue de la Loi.\" The apartments, elegantly painted with italian q4"], [256, "232 LETTER XXVIII. landscapes, are large and numerous, and splen didly lighted every evening. The garden was illuminated last night, for the first time this season, and is as pretty as its limited extent can permit. It is the fashion to come here about ten o'clock; and the amusement consists in walking about, chatting with your friends, eating ices and cakes, or drinking tea, punch, or lemonade, the sale of which articles constitute the Avhole profits of the landlord, to Avhom nothing js paid for admittance. Frescati is, in short, a kind of coffee house ; and, notAvithstanding the smell of brandy, gin, and rum, generally preva lent, is frequented by ladies as Avell as gentlemen. When I first came here, I supposed that these ladies Avere of a certain description : but I Avas soon undeceived ; and, besides seeing at this place the most respectable families of Paris, was assured by a ci-devant comtesse excessively rigid on matters of etiquette, \" que toute la bonne compagnie y alloit*.\" After this authoritatiA'e de cision, it would be presumptuous to doubt the propriety of going to Frescati; and our most scrupulous countryAvomen may, Avithout appre hension of being taken either for \" filles\" or \" parvenues,\" enjoy this strange and singular amusement. Tivoli is but just opened for the season. I have been there once. It is a large and beautiful * That all the good company of Paris went there."], [257, "LETTER XXVIII. 233 garden, situate in \" la rue St. Lazare,\" in the \"Chauss6ed'Antin.\" It Avas illuminated Avith much taste ; the trees are lofty ; and the whole seemed to resemble what I imagine our Vauxhall Avas, before it Avas covered in. There Avas a band of music, and dancing, on a platform erected for the purpose. There Avas also a party of tumblers. The company Avas not either very numerous or very genteel ; but the night Avas not hot, and fine Aveather is necessary to render this place agreeable ; as there is no house or shelter of any kind. In the months of July or august Tivoli must be delightful. I forgot to mention, that there Avere round abouts, (as they are vulgarly called in Eng land) on which full grown people Avere very gravely amusing themselves. I heard, the other day, of a duel, Avhich took place in con sequence of a dispute for one of these places.

MY DEAR SIR, f\\S> my stay at Paris draAvs towards a conclusion, I haA-e occupied the three or four last days in vi siting those objects of curiosity, Avhich as yet 1 had neglected to see. The manufactory of Gobelins deserves all its celebrity. The colours, the design, and the exe cution of the tapestry made here, are equal to the productions of the finest painting. I Avas shown some specimens, Avhich Avere uncommonly beautiful, particularly tAvo, pieces, one of Avhich represented the assassination of the admiral Co ligni, and the other the heroic conduct of the president Mole, copied from the picture at Ver sailles, an account of Avhich I have already given. There are ninety persons now employed, of whom I saw several at Avork. It is astonishing with what facility they seem to perform' the molt difficult tasks, but I am told that the art is not"], [260, "236 LETTER XXIX. learnt Avithout much time and considerable atten- tion. The apprenticeship requires six years, and at least eighteen are necessary to make a pro- ficient. The Avorkmen are not locked up within the Avails of the manufactory, as Avas the case during the monarchy, but they are kept under the constant \"sun'eilIance*of the police.\" Most of the pieces now in haud have been ordered by the first consul, and are destined to form the orna ment of St. Cloud, and other public buildings. From the Gobelins, situate in the most dis tant part of the Fauxbourg St. Germain, I drove along the new Boulevard to the observatory. I found here only some common sized telescopes, on which I observed with pride the respectable name of \" Dollond,\" of London. I Avas in formed that a magnificent instrument of this kind is preparing on the plan of Herschel, Avhich is to be tAventy-tAvo feet long, with a speculum of platina. It is to be moved on a platform, for the purpose of making observations, by means of a machine invented for the purpose. I as cended the top of the building, and the vieAv thence, Avhich commands all Paris, is grand and striking. Near the observatory is the nursery of that hu mane establishment called \"les Enfans trouv^s,\" which is still kept up on the old philanthropic plan.

Their in fancy is passed in the building shoAvn to me; they are, at a certain age, sent into the country, for the benefit of the air, and then return to the principal hospital of the institution at Paris, Avhere their education is completed. Their number is seldom less than a thousand. I shall continue to speak of the different ob jects I have lately seen, in the same order in which I visited them. The Champ de Mars, where, on the 14 th of July, 1790, I Avas present, Avhen the unfortunate Lewis XVI received and repeated the oath of fidelity to that constitution which Avas so soon violated, has still the remains of that vast amphi theatre, made by the activity and zeal of the Pa risians in the course of fourteen days, and on Avhich Avere seated nearly a million of people. I recollected all the spots, Avhere ;he principal au thorities Avere placed on that memorable day; and it Avill be needless for me to repeat the innu^ merable reflections which Avere created by a re. membrance of the extraordinary and manyco loured events which have since occurred. The"], [262, "238 LETTER XXIX. Ecole Militaire, which is uoav a barrack for the consular horse guards, forms the front and prin cipal ornament of the Champ de Mars, which is terminated on the other side by the river Seine. L 'Ecole Militaire Avas built, in 1751, from a plan of Gabriel. It has a handsome facade, and a lofty dome, with a dial, and the figures of Time and Astronomy. The building of \" les InA'alides\" presents one of the most striking objects of Pans. Besides the beauty of its construction, its. handsome en trance, its four courts, its celebrated clock, its lofty dome, and elegant pillars, it contains, in the principal hall, or chapel, now called \" le Temple de Mars,\" the colours, or ensigns, taken. during the Avat, by the republican armies, from the diffe rent poAvers opposed to France. This beautiful room at least a hundred feet long, is lined on all sides Avith the badges of triumph, many of Avhich bear, from their tattered appearance, the most convincing proofs of not having been obtained without considerable difficulty. Among the in numerable colours of all nations, I perceived, Avith pride, that there Avere only tAvo or three english; and these, from their size, had belonged to some ship, perhaps to a merchantman, or to that man of Avar, which, after sharing the glories of Aboukir, was taken by five french vessels of the. line, after a resistance no less honourable 1"], [263, "239 LETTER XXIX. than her former success. In the centre of this spacious apartment, to the right, surrounded by the trophies of his successors ancl countrymen, is placed the tomb of Turenne. This monument Avas removed to the Temple of Mars by the pre sent government, and placed here, Avith con siderable pomp, after having been saved from the fury of Jacobinical rage, and preserved, by the care of le Noir, in the \" Muske des Monuments francois.\" The circumstance Avhich I have just mentioned, naturally leads me to speak of the last named in stitution, which I visited yesterday for the second time. On my arrival at Paris, I went to see le Musee des Monuments francois ; and not being as much struck Avith the exhibition as I expected, from its great renoAvn, I purposely postponed speaking of it, till I had had an opportunity of examining' it again Avith all the attention it de served. After several hours employed in this second vieAv, I continue of my former opinion, that the spot*, in Avhich these monuments are collected, is infinitely too small; that the garden, meant to be the tranquil site of sepulchral ho nours, and the calm retreat of departed gran deur, is on so limited a scale, is so surrounded with adjoining houses, ancl altogether so ill ar- ?

It must, hoAvever, be acknoAvledged, that \"le Noir,\" by Avhose care this establishment Avas formed, deserves great credit for the courage with Avhich he rescued the many precious monu ments here deposited, from the barbarous and undiscriminating fury of revolutionary vandalism, for the perseverance and attention Avhich has marked his conduct in the arrangement, and for the plan (whether successful or not, I shall not pretend to examine) of presenting complete and exact representations of the art of building in the different ages. Among the innumerable tombs, croAvded together in this collection, of Avhich a catalogue, in large octaA-o, is sold at the door, I observed many of great beauty, taste, and sym metry. Kings, poets, belles, philosophers, and painters, torn from the graves, in Avhich, for centuries past, their remains had tranquilly re posed, Avould haA'e had no stone to record their past celebritv. if this institution had not existed."], [265, "241 LETTER XXIX. The arts, too, are highly indebted to the founder, for the specimens of sculpture, many of them chefs d'\u0153uvre, Avhich are here seen in all their original perfection. Models, too, of ancient ancl Celtic buildings are added to those of french ar chitecture; Le Noir's favourite plan of having a chapel for each century, ornamented Avithall the appro priate decorations, ancl containing the tombs of contemporary persons, is in part executed, ancl three or four ages have already their respective temples, completed in the taste of the times which belonged to them. These chapels have been much admired by persons, Avhose knowledge on such subjects entitle them to respect; and it Avould, therefore, be presumptuous in me to give a dissenting voice. I shall be pardoned, however, for remarking, that there appeared, in the whole arrangement, a kind of quackery, Avhich prevented my feeling that unalloyed satisfaction Avhich I had been led to expect; and that, in spite of my better judgment, I felt an inclination to laugh, Avhen perhaps my tears ought to have floAved. As every body must rejoice at the preservation of these monuments, whatever opinions he may entertain about the arrangement, I cannot help regretting, that they are not deposited in a place more Avorthy of containing them. Since the re storation of religion has removed every obstacle ft"], [266, "242 LETTER XXIX. which could be started to such a project, Avould it not be Avorthy of the present government, de cidedly the friend ancl protector of the arts, to order that all these precious specimens of sculp ture should become the ornament of one or more of the principal churches of Paris, the present naked state of which is an additional argument in favour of the measure' What splendour Avould they not both receive ancl confer, in being re moved either to Notre Dame, St. Sulpice, or St. GenSvieve ? To satisfy the curiosity Avhich I know you en tertain on such subjects, I examined, with atten tion, the principal objects, and marked in my catalogue those Avhich seemed most deserving of notice. The following is the list: No. 5. The tomb of Dagobert, with the figures of Nau- tilda his wife, and Clovis his son. 94. The tomb of Lewis XII. 99.

POSTSCRIPT, Returning home to day, at half past four o'clock, from view- ing some of the sights, (which I have mentioned in my letter), we found a messenger waiting with a note from the Thuilleries.

She is just returned ; and from her statement, I send you the following short account. Tie entertainment was extremely elegant, and the sight very striking. More than two hundred persons sat down to table in a splendid apartment. The company consisted, besides the family of Bonaparte, of the ministers, the am- bassadors, several generals, senators, counsellors of state, aud other constituted authorities. The number of women present was by no means in proportion to that of the men, and did not exceed fifteen.

Paris, may the 10th, 180a (20 floreaL) MY DEAR SIR, 1 HAVE postponed speaking to you of the literary establishments of Paris, till my residence here had been sufficiently long to enable me to give my opinion Avith some degree of certainty. Perhaps there is no town in the knoAvn Avorld, Avhich affords such favourable opportunities of ac quiring ancl cultivating knoAvledge, as that from Avhich I am noAv Avriting. On this subject, equality in the best sense exists ; and while the poor man has the finest libraries, and most extensive col lections opened to his use, Avithout any expense Avhatever, he, Avhose circumstances are moderately easy, obtains, for a trifling consideration, every possible means of additional improvement,"], [274, "250 LETTER XXX. The national library, which existed during the monarchy, ancl Avas founded by Charles the fifth, occupies a large building in the rue de la Loi (ci-devant de Richelieu). An elegant staircase, painted by Pelegrini, leads to the spacious apart ments on the first floor, Avhich take up three sides ofthe large court by Avhich you enter, and Avhich contain no less than three hundred thousand print ed volumes. Five or six rooms, Avell lighted and well aired, offer on each side the best books, in every science ancl in every language. Tables are placed for the convenience of students, and atten tive librarians civilly deliver the Avorks Avhich are asked for. In the second room is a curious piece of work manship, called \"le Parnasse francois*\" by Titon Dutillct, iu Avhich the different poets and Avriters of France are represented as climbing up the steep ascent of that difficult but inspired mountain. In my opinion, it desen'es attention more as a specimen of national taste, and private industry, than as a production either ef genius pr of beauty. In the third \"salon\" are the celebrated globes, the one celestial, the other terrestrial, made in 1683, by the Jesuit Coronelli, for the cardinal d' Est rees. They are of immense dimensions, but require new painting ; as, iu the first place, they were made before the last discoveries, ancl se- * French Parnassus. 1"], [275, "251 LETTER XXX. condly, the colours are almost entirely effaced by the lapse of time. This admirable library, which also contains collections of medals, and other curiosities, is open to all persons Avho choose to attend as students, Avithout any expense, recommendation, or favour, every day in the week ; but, to prevent the labours of these being interrupted, the visits of such as only come from motives of curiosity are limited to two days in seven. I saw, with pleasure, that the object of this splendid institu tion is fully ansAvered. Forty or fifty young men, deeply intent on the subject of their inquiries, were seated in different parts of the room, and seemed to pursue, with enthusiasm, those studies, Avhich the liberality of their country thus afforded them the means of cultivating. The gallery of manuscripts (called the gallery of Mazarine) contains thirty thousand volumes, generally on the history of France, ancl more particularly relating to facts Avhich have taken place since the reign of LeAvis XI, twenty-fiA'e thousand of Avhich are in learned or foreign lan guages. The librarian, to Avhose care these pre cious papers are entrusted, Avas knoAvn to a gen tleman avIio accompanied me, and through his goodness we saAV several, Avhich are not commonly exhibited. I Avas much surprised at finding, in the hand Avriting of Lewis XIV. memoirs of his oavu times, so accurately taken, that, Avith very little disli- S"], [276, "252 LETTER XXX. culty, they might be prepared for the press. I understand that a gentleman, belonging to the library, began this useful task, and had made con siderable progress, Avhen a sudden illness deprived his country and the literary Avorld of his services. I was not a little entertained Avith the love letters of Henry IV, Avhich are in perfect pre servation, and some of which have, I belieA'e, been published. The folloAving is a sac simile of one, Avhich particularly attracted my notice : '.' Mon cher c\u0153ur, nous venons de dyner ceans, et sommes fort sous.

The five large rooms on the second floor con tain the titles and genealogies of private families, Avhich, though forbidden, since the revolution, to be kept by individuals, are' here presenred, in order to ascertain the claims of property, and to assist the researches of historians.

The first contains sculptors, architects, engineers, and engravers, arranged in schools. The second, prints, emblems, ancl devices of piety. The third, greek ancl roman fables and antiquities.

The greater part of the sheets are coloured, some are on vellum, copied from glass windows, from pieces of tapestry, and from figures on tombs. The picture of king John, being the first specimen of french painting, is found in this collection. It is well preserved. I ought not to conclude my account of the national library without mentioning, that among the manuscripts there are several in the persian, arahic, and Chinese languages.

The library of the \" Institute\" is open every day to members, and every 15th of the month to the public. The legislature, the tribunate, the senate, and the other constituted authorities, have also their libraries. In addition to these sources of knoAvledgc, there are several literary institutions, called, when 1 first came here, \" des Lycees, or Lyceums,\" but which, in consequence of the national col leges lately established having taken that name, have changed theirs, and assumed the appellation of \" des Athenees.\" The most distinguished of these, \" le Lycee, \" (or, according to its new title, \" l'Ath6n\u00a3e,\"), \" republicain,\" has been the principal source of my amusement at Paris. It consists of annual subscribers, Avho, for the moderate sum of four louis, enjoy all its bene fits. The society has a large floor, or apartment, situate near the \" Palais Royal,\" (in a street called by its name) ; ancl it is open the Avhole of every day for the use of the subscribers. There is a small library, Avhere all the periodical pub-"], [280, "256 LETTER XXX. lications and neAVspapers are taken in; and while three or four rooms are appropriated to con- A-ersation, one is devoted to reading, ancl pro found silence is there ordered and maintained. In addition to these, there is an excellent lec ture room, with all the necessary apparatus for experiments, in which the ablest men in France appear as professors. The subject of the lec tures, Avhich are regularly given, always tAvice, ancl frequently three times, in the course of the day, are literature, the sciences, and modern languages. When I add, that Fourcroy takes the chymical department, that Cuvier reads on natural history, and that la Harpe, till banished by the government, Avas the professor of litera ture, you will readily allow, that no establish ment can be better organized. Besides these, \" Hassenjratz\" gives A'ery good lectures on agriculture, and the studies connected Avith that science. \" SuS,\" as an anatomist, is justly cele brated; and the other professors, in their diffe rent lines, prove themselves Avell qualified for the tasks assigned them.

Perpignan, la Motte, Fontenelle, ancl some other authors of that stamp, Avere the subjects of his discourses ; and, beginning with telling us that these Avriters Avere either entirely forgotten, or deserved to be so, he continued, for Avhole days together, to drag their ghosts before his audience, whom he seemed to convert into a \" tribunal revoluti onaire\" of criticism, and to attack their memory with all the Avarmth and violence of an \" ac cusateur publique.\" These philippics against dead and neglected authors, filled up Avith long quotations from the Avorks which he ridiculed, interlarded Avith attacks on those philosophical ancl political principles of Avhich he was originally the ardent advocate, and enlivened iioav and then with a joke, and sometimes Avith an anec dote, constituted the Avhole merit of his lectures. Yet the members of the \" Lycee\" heard him Avith Avonder and admiration; and Avhenever he threAv clown his book, turned round with a look of self-complacence, or filled his tumbler Avith s"], [282, "258 LETTER XXX. lemonade from the decanter always placed by his side, the signal Avas instantly taken, and loud and repeated applauses thundered from every corner of the room. To account for this par tiality, 1 must repeat, that every thing at Paris is ruled by fashion; ancl la Harpe being generally considered as the most distinguished literary man noAv alive, every thing whieh fell from his tongue Avas necessarily excellent; and I baveno doubt, that if he had contented himself Avith reading an article from one of the neAvspapers of the morning, he would have been equally ad mired and as Avarmly applauded. The \" Lycee\" is altogether a most excellent establishment; and, considering, that two lec tures, and frequently three, are given six days in every Aveek, ancl that these lectures are included in the subscription, the price of four louis is very moderate. I cannot speak properly of this institution as a place of society, as I seldom staid there after the conclusion of the lectures; but I am told, that the members are, generally speaking, re spectable men. The rooms are constantly full, and some persons may be said nearly to pass their lives there, since they are scarcely ever absent, except at the hour of dinner. I think it not improbable, that much amusement may be found in the conversation ofthe members; but I"], [283, "259 LETTER XXX. confine my recommendation to the advantages Avhich the \" Lycee\" affords, as an easy source of profitable knowledge. \" L'lnstitut national,\" that celebrated so ciety, Avhich has succeeded \" V academic fran faise,'' Avhich is held up as the great republican repository of genius ancl learning, and into Avhich admittance is solicited Avith so much eagerness, both at home and abroad, consists of one hun dred and forty-four members resident at Paris, and of twenty-four foreign associates. It is di- A'ided into three classes; the sciences, physical and mathematical; the sciences, moral and po litical ; literature ancl the fine arts. Each of these classes is again subdivided. The \" Inst it ut\" has a public stance, or meet ing, on the 15th of every month. I Avas present at one of these assemblies ; and I am ashamed to confess, that I had difficulty in refraining from laughter. The society holds its sittings in a spa cious room in the palace of the Louvre. The members Avere seated in such silent, solemn state, each with his reading desk, books, ink, ancl Avax lights before him, Avhile a dull and uninteresting paper Avas reading, that their gravity produced the opposite effect on me, and \" malgre\" my re spect for the establishment, and for those Avho belong to it, it was not Avithout a struggle that I composed my features, and checked the impulse of nature.

The \" Jardin national des Pla?ites*,\" founded originally by Buffon, is one of the most interest ing objects at Paris. Naturalists, and persons fond of botany, have here every opportunity of cultivating those useful studies, and of gratifying, in the amplest manner, their favourite taste. The garden itself, Avhich is extensive, ancl reaches to the riA-er, contains every kind of curious and exotic plant. There is a greenhouse likewise, filled Avith such trees, the tender nature of Avhich cannot bear the coldness of a northern atmo sphere. There is also a menagerie, or collection of animals, among which every kind of fierce, rare, and foreign quadrupeds may be found.

They were of very considerable dimensions, equal to those, the effigy of which is sometimes seen on a London stage. The male has lately died, and \"Cuvier\" is to anatomise the body, and give a lecture on the subject. The female, for some time after the death of her companion, showed evident symp toms of grief, and even refused, at first, every kind of nourishment. The house attached to \" le Jardin des Plantes\" is filled Avith a precious collection of curiosities in natural history, pro perly arranged, ancl correctly named. Several rooms are filled Avith these valuable objects; aud I am told, by persons acquainted Avith such sub jects, that very little is Avanting to make this depot complete. Stuffed quadrupeds*, birds, plants, fossils, fish, and shells, offer every kind of variety; and even the ignorant man finds here a source of never-failing amusement. The col lection of insects is particularly curious and ex tensive. I believe it is considered as the finest in the Avorld.

The middle of the cabinet forms an amphitheatre, capable of containing two hundred persons. Glass cases enclose, in the finest order, minerals of every kind, ancl from every part of the world. Four other separate cases offer models of machinery. On the stairs, leading to the gallery, is the bust of monsieur le Sage, Avhich Avas placed there by the gratitude of his pupils. The gallery itself is surrounded Avith cases, containing specimens of the productions of mines, too numerous to be placed Avith those which are in the first cabinet of mines.

There are likewise private subscription lectures on all subjects, many of which are of high repute, such as those of Mr. Charles on natural philosophy, of the excellence of Avhose experiments, ancl the clearness of Avhose discourses, I hear a very fa vourable account. The english, german, and italian languages, are taught by professors at the different \" lycees,\" by particular subscription, and for moderate sums in other places. In short, there is no literary pursuit, of any kind, which any man, in any circumstances, may not cultivate Avith suc cess at Paris. Fortitude is necessary to resist the opportu nities of committing crimes, isthe individual be poor, and of falling into the temptations of plea sure, if he happen to be rich. Guarded against these respective evils, the industrious scholar, Avhether covered Avith rags, or \" clad every clay in purple,\" may move on in the career of letters Avith every possible advantage, and Avith the cer* nature, is foreign to my object.

Paris, hoAvever, does not possess many circu lating libraries, and of the few which exist, I can give no favourable account. Perhaps the facility Avith Avhich Avorks of value are consulted, and the trifle for which those of the day are bought, are the reasons of this deficiency. It is, hoAvever, a considerable convenience wanting in so great a city ; and I think that such an establishment, on a liberal and extended scale, would be a profit able ancl useful subject of speculation.

MY DEAR SIR, JtOU know how much I dislike the petty detail of economical arrangements, and Avill therefore pardon me for having so long delayed to speak to you of the expenses and mode of living at Paris. I haAe not forgotten your queries, and Avill, in this letter, endeavour to answer them as fully as possible. You Avill, at least, derive one advan tage from my apparent neglect; that the inform ation Avhich I shall iioav send you, is not hastily given, but the result of experience, gained during a residence of nearly seven months. \u00ab Persons Avho have represented Paris (to use a vulgar phrase) as a cheap place, have either been greatly deceived themseh-es, or have in tended purposely to deceiA'e. The difference between the expense of living in London ancl in Paris, appears to me infinitely less than it is generally supposed. It is true, indeed, that a french family . Avill apparently support a much more elegant establishment on a given income, than an english one can in London ; but I believe"], [291, "267 LETTER XXXI. the cause arises almost entirely from the supe riour economy and arrangement of the former, from the sparing system observed in the interiour of private houses, and from the constant and unvarying attention to the minuti\u00e6 of every disbursement. Though the table of a Parisian boasts, Avhen company are invited, every kind of luxury, yet 1 have reason to suspect, that, on ordinary occasions, \" le bouilli*,\" and \" le vin ordinaire,\" form its principal support. A car riage, Avhich has been in a family twenty or thirty years, is treated Avith all the respect due to its antiquity, and is seldom or eA'er discarded on account of its oldfashioned shape or faded co lour ; and horses, used only now and then, may be fed on hay ancl straw. Liveries are forbidden by the law ; and servants are therefore permitted to Avait in the tattered garments Avhich their pre sent master has left off, or in those which they have collected in a former service. The drawing-rooms, and \" sailes a manger,\" are lighted, even at the largest assemblies, Avith oil, instead of Avax; and antichambers and stair cases are so dark, that to find one's Avay into the principal apartment is generally a service of * The boiled beef, which, after making the soup, is al ways served at a french table. \" Le vin ordinaire,\" or common wine, is a weak, sour beverage, which costs about 6ixpence english per bottle, and is not, either in taste or strength, superiour to our small beer."], [292, "268 LETTER XXXI. difficulty, if not of danger. As to fire, on common occasions, one in the bed room either of \" madame,\" or \"monsieur,\" is thought suf ficient, Avith the addition of a poele,\" or stoA'e, Avhich is so contrived, as to heat both the eating room, and the antichamber, in Avhich latter the servants ahvays sit. In respect to dress, an old great coat (or \" riding coat,\" as they call it) is often Avorn in the house, by gentlemen, ancl the belles avIio appear with the greatest splendour in the evening, sometimes pass their morning in a poAvdering gOAvn, or \" robe de chambre.\" The same kind of rigid economy is observed in their amusements. A family of distinction will occupy a box \" au second, or au bhwir*,\" to save a feAV livres ; and I kneAV a young lady of considerable fortune, who expressed an anxious wish to see the first appearance of Vestris, and who, when a place Avas offered her, refused it, malgre the general passion for spectacles, and the celebrity of this, Avhen she found that the price of the ticket Avas niue francs (or seven and sixpence english). I have entered into this ex planation, to account for the apparently splendid establishments of persons of moderate fortunes, which might otherwise seem to contradict the * The boxes \" au benoir\" are on the level with the pit, under the first tier, and are in the shape of a bath, from which thev take their name."], [293, "269 LETTER XXXI. opinion Avhich I am about to give, and \\tdiieh I have already hinted. I repeat, then, that an english family settling here*, with english ideas and english habits, would spend very little less than they Avould do in London, Avith a similar establishment. To enable you to judge for yourself on this subject, I shall mention the prices of the most essential articles of expense ; some of Avhich are lower, Avhile others are infinitely higher. Meat is much cheaper, being only eleven or twelve sols per pound (or five or six pence english). Bread bears, at present, nearly the same price in the two countries. The keep of horses costs infinitely less at Paris, than in London. Poultry is cheaper; and Avine of the best kind may be bought for something more than we pay for good port. On the other hand, house rent is equally dear, if not dearer. Furniture is exorbitant ; ancl dress of all kinds, both for men and Avomen (only excepting shoes and gloves) is, beyond compa- * Persons going to France ought to know, that, the ex change being at present against England, we regularly lose from five to seven per cent on the money drawn from the latter country.

The price of amusements, in the first places, is nearly the same at the large theatres of Paris, as at those of London ; and spec tacles, being infinitely more frequented at the former than in the latter city, much more is spent, in this article, in the one than in the other capital. Groceries are dearer, and fuel at least double. Putting these articles, the one against the other, perhaps Avith economy eleven hundred pounds iu Paris might purchase as many conveniences as twelve in London. But I think even this diffe rence is liberally allowed. Having given this rough calculation of family expenses, 1 shall proceed to speak more parti cularly of those of a foreigner, or temporary resident. On this point I can be more positive, having experience for my guide. A job carriage and pair of horses cost from twenty to twenty two louis per month, according to the manner in which you are sen-ed. A pair of horses, Avithout the hire of a carriage, may be had for fifteen or sixteen louis per' month. In both cases the coachman is paid by the jobman ; but the former expects a trifle, as a mark of your approbation. A \" laquais de place\" asks four, but will take three, livres (or half a crown English) per day."], [295, "LETTER XXXI. 271 I Apartments A'ary so infinitely in price, accord ing to tlie part of the town where they are situ ate, according to the number of rooms wanted, according to the height of the floor, and, above all, acording to the bargain made by the indi vidual wanting them, that it is very difficult to six any thing like an average. I shall only say, generally, that I think a single man may be well lodged (at a price proportioned to the ac commodation which he requires) from five to twelve louis per month ; aud a family of two or three persons, Avith as many servants, from twelve to thirty louis. A \" trait eur\" Avill supply a dinner at six livres (or five shillings) per head ; but the fare will nei ther be very good, nor very abundant. Wine, cf the best quality, if taken from the \" traiteur,\" or the master of the hotel, will cost from five to six livres the bottle. The same may be had from a Avine merchant at about half the price. I ought to add, that it is not expected here, as in England, that the Avine should necessarily be ordered from the person Avho supplies your table. The price of Avashing is greater than in Lon don; and the english ladies complain much of tlie manner in which it. is executed. Fuel is immensely dear. A \" A'oie cle bois,\" or load of wood, the contents of which one fire Avill consume in ten days, costs about thirty two 5"], [296, "I 272 LETTER XXXI. or thirty three livres (making about twenty six or tAventy seven shillings english.) About nine livres (or seven shillings ancl six- pence) are paid for admittance in the first places for each person at the \"opera,\" at \" le theatre de la Feydeau,\" ancl at \"le theatre de la rue FaA'art;\" at the \"theatre francois\" six livres, twelve sols, (or five shillings and sixpence eng- lish) and in the little theatres, half a crown, or three shillings. I cannot give the prices exactly, as they vary according to the manner in Avhich you go to the play-house. In taking a box, more is paid for each ticket, than Avhat is other wise paid simply for the admittance of each in dividual at the door. Clothing is very expensive. A plain frock of superfine cloth costs from four louis to five and a half, according to the fashion of the tailor : and I am told, that ladies' muslins are at least four times dearer than in London. About lodgings, it is very necessary that those Avho intend visiting Paris should make previous ar rangements. The hotels are not so numerous as before the revolution; ancl the difficulty of get ting well accommodated is much greater than any one, Avho has not been here, can possibly con ceive. Great advantage is also taken of the situation of strangers, a\\'1io arrive (unprepared) at one of these houses Avith post horses, the drivers of which are always impatient, ancl very"], [297, "273 LETTER XXXI. often impertinent, if you detain them long in seeing rooms, or go to several hotels, before you ate settled. To enable you ancl your friends to form some idea of themeritsof the different hotels, and accordingly to give directions to your correspondents, I will add a list and short account of the most celebrated. \" L'H6tel de Grange Bateliere, rue de Grange Bateliere,\" in the Chauss&e Dantin, (where Lord Cormvallis lodged) is a large and spacious house, in Avhich there are many hand some apartments. It has also the advantage of a fine and extensive garden. I think I have heard, that the charges here are rather high. The situation of the house is excellent ; adjoin ing the Boulevard, nearly opposite \" la rue de la Loi (or de Richelieu),\" and in that part of the toAvn, Avhich is now esteemed the most fashion able. \" L'Hdtel dc 1' Empire,\" rue Cerruti, (for merly the private house of M. la Bordc, the king's Banker) is much frequented by the eng lish. It is of course expensive. The high reputation which this hotel enjoys, induced me to go there on my first arrival. I Avas much disappointed. I did not find either the lodgings good, or the cooking very superiour. The principal apart ment is certainly very splendid, the price of Avhich is ninety louis per month ; but the other rooms have nothing very particular to recom- T"], [298, "274 LETTER XXXI. mend them. Every kind of refreshment is found in the house, and charged by the article, as at the hotels in London, and at about the same prices. This house is also in the \" Chauss^e Dantin.\" ancl not far distant from \" 1' Hdtel de Grange Bateliere.\" In the \" rue de la Loi,\" (or \" de Richelieu\") there are several hotels ; but the situation, though extremely central and convenient, has the disadvantage of being A'ery noisy. The upper part of the street, near the Boulevard, is the most agreeable ; and in that position are \" ti Hotel de 1' Europe,\" and \" 1' Hdtel des Etrangers.\" They appear good houses. I know nothing of their character. \" L' Hotel d' Angleterre, rue des Filles de St. Thomas,\" A-ery near the \" rue de la Loi,\" has been inhabited by several English this Avinter. The charges are said to be expensive. The situation is convenient ; but it is noisy, and surrounded by houses. \" L' Hotel des Etrangers, rue Vivienne,\" very near the \" rue de la Loi,\" and the \" Palais Royal,\" is also in the centre of the toAvn. This house I have heard more generally commended by those Avho have lodged there, as to its prices, accommodations, and kitchen, than any other at Paris ; but I cannot say I like the street where it stands, Avhich is both close and dirty. \u00a3"], [299, "275 LETTER XXXI. L' Hotel de Mirabeau, rue de Helder,\" is in a iicav street, near the Boulevard. It seems a good house. I do not know its character. The tAvo hotels, the situation of which is the most agreeable, being both near the Boulevard, the Thuil'eries, and the Champs Elis6es, are \" I' Hotel de Courlande, place Louis XV, (or de la Concorde\"), and \" V Hotel des Etrangers, rue Royale (or de la Concorde.\" The former is part of that fine building, the \" Garde Meuble, \" and stands in the most beautiful ' place,\" or square, of Paris. The AvindoAvs command a delightful A'iew of the \"place\" the bridge, the river, the Thuilleries, and Champs Elisees. The house is newly furnished, and only lately opened. I am sorry to add, that it consists but of few apartments ; but those which there are, are elegant and spacious. The prices are extremely high. I Avas asked forty louis a month for a second floor. The other house, I mean \" /' Hotel des Etran gers, rue Royale (or de la Concorde)\" standing in a very Avide street, Avhich runs from the Boulevard to \"la place Louis XV,\" has equal advantages as to the neighbourhood of all the public Avalks, with the hotel of which I spoke last ; but it does not command the same view. I am forced also to mention, having lived two months in the house, that the landlord is a very t 2"], [300, "276 LETTER XXXI. Insolent felloAV, and his Avise, if possible, more impertinent than himself. There are three small hotels, called, \" /' Hotel de Galle,\" \" F Hotel des Quinz Vingts,\" ancl \" /' Hotel de Carousel,\" all in the immediate neighbourhood of the palace of the Thuilleries, of Avhich each commands a view. A single man Avould be agreeably lodged at one of these ; but I should not suppose, that there Avas sufficient ac commodation at either for a family consisting of several persons. In the \" Fauxbourg St. Germain,\" the hotels formerly frequented by the english either, exist no more, or have lost their reputation. Those only Avhich are of any repute in this part of the toAvr), seem to be \" /' Hotel de Rome, rue St. Dominique,\" Avhere there are several handsome apartments, more remarkable for their size than their cleanliness; and \" I' Hdtel de Marengo,\" in the same street, and next door to the former. The lodgings of the latter are good; but some friends of mine, Avho lived there, complained much of the disagreeable state, in Avhich they found the beds. Both these hotels have good gardens. \" L' Hotel de Caramons \" in the same street, belonging to the ci-devant comte of that name, though not an \" hdtel garni,\" is let in apart ments, the greater part of which were occupied"], [301, "LETTER XXXI. 277 :first by Mr. Jackson, and afterwards by Mr. Merry. The rooms are delightful; but it rarely happens, that any are vacant. I forgot to mention, that there is also in this street a small hotel, called, \" I' Hotel de Jura,\" which is well furnished, and has a pretty garden. The houses, which I have enumerated, are those which are the most known, the best situate, and the most esteemed. Beside these, there are \" I' Hotel de Vauban,\" \" V Hotel de Congres,\" and \" /' Hotel de la Grand Bretagne,\" all situate in \" la rue St. Honore,\" and said to be respect able houses. For those also avIio do not ob ject to be surrounded Avith bustle and noise, \" I' Hotel de la Chancellerie,\" near the \" Palais Royal,\" Avill offer good accommodations. I am told, the apartments there are uncommonly ele* gant, ancl extremely spacious*. To this account I must add a negative recom mendation of la rue Traversiere, in Avhich there are several hotels, ancl into Avhich the AvindoAVS of some in la rue de la Loi also look. A perpetual * I have heard, since I left Paris, that a very fine house, formerly belonging to a nobleman, and known by the name of \" /' Hotel de Beauveau,\" has lately been opened as an f* hotel garni,\" and assumed the title of \" Hotel de Prince de Galle.\" It stands in \" la Rue Fauxbourg St. Honore,\" nearly fronting one of the avenues to the Champs Elisees. In spring the situation must be very pleasant. It is at a considerable distance from the theatres, but in a most re-. 6pectable part of the town. T 3"], [302, "278 LETTER XXXI. market, Avith all the attendant smells, renders the houses in \"la rue Traversiere\" extremely un pleasant; and the same reason obstructs the passage, so that it is difficult, in a carriage, to find one's Avay to any door in this street. The caution is the more necessary, as postboys frequently recommend the situation. There is some objection to almost every hotel ; I cannot, therefore, recommend any one ; but, were I to visit Paris again, I think I should either try ' ' /' Hotel de Courlande, place Louis XV,\" the situation of which is incomparable; \" /' Hotel de Grange Bateliere,\" Avhich, in accommodations and size, is superior to any house of the same kind; or \" /' Hotel des Etrangers, rue Vivienne,\" Avhich is universally well spoken of by those who have inhabited it. As to the \" traiteurs,\" or persons Avho supply you with dinners, they sometimes belong to the house where you lodge, and sometimes not. I tried seA'eral during my stay at Paris, and I found them all so bad, ancl so uncertain, that, Avere I to return, I Avould either hire a cook, or dine constantly at the house of a \" restau rateur*.\" The most celebrated are, Naudit, ancl Robert, in the Palais Royal, Beauvitlier in the rue de la Loi, and Verry in the garden of the Thuilleries. Besides the public room, * \" Restaurateurs\" are tavern keepers, where dinners are served."], [303, "LETTER XXXI. 279 Avhich is ahvays elegantly ornamented, there is, at each of these places, several small rooms, or cabinets, for private parties. A long bill of fare, called \" la carte,\" consisting of all the delicacies of the season, and eveiy variety of Avine, with the prices affixed to each article, is handed to you, and the dishes are no sooner named, than they are instantly served. The apartments are tastefully decorated, the linen and plate are particularly clean, ancl the Avaiters civil, attentive, and Avell dressed. The cooking is incomparable. Ladies, as Avell as gentlemen, dine at these houses, ancl even in the public room several of the former are always present. On a rough calculation, the expense of dining at one of the first restaurateurs, including a fair quan tity of the best Avine, varies from tAvelve livres (ten shillings) to a louis each person. There are, hoAvever, inferiour houses of this kind, Avhere, even for trent-six sols (or eighteen pence english) a dinner of several dishes, and a bottle of Avine, are allowed. As I never tried one of these economical repas, I cannot speak of the fare they afford. A returned \" abbe\" assured me, that he dined in this manner \" a merveille;\" but, notAvithstanding his authority, I should scarcely recommend a hungry en gli sli man to make the experiment. In concluding my account of hotels and traitcurs, 1 must repeat my advice to you, to T 4"], [304, "280 LETTER XXXI. make a previous bargain for Avhatever you may want. In Paris, no tradesman has a settled price ; and shopkeeper or landlord, who has the most rei spectable appearance, is not to be trusted. An englishman, who, from delicacy, omits to offer a smaller sum than that Avhich is asked, may be certain, that he makes a present of at least fifty per cent to the person of whom he pur chases. In every line of trade the same system is pursued; and eA'en in buying books and plate, I have knoAvn one fourth of the original demand taken. Strangers ought to be particularly careful, hoAV they deal Avith the \" marchands\" of the \" h6tel garni\" Avhere they lodge. They are a tribe of people, Avho, under the recommendation of the landlord or porter, to whom they pay a regular commission at the expense of the tra veller, knock perpetually at his door, and, Avith the utmost importunity, insist on shoAving the different articles of their trade. What they sell is ahvays dear, generally out of fashion, and frequently damaged. In calculating the expenses of Paris, much will depend on the manner in which an indi vidual lays out his money; and I am certain, that if a good manager and a thoughtless young man Avere, during a Avinter passed in Paris, to order exactly the same articles, and were after wards to compare their disbursements, a differ-"], [305, "LETTER XXXI. 281 ence Avould appear in the result, of nearly one half. It must be remembered also, that \" milord anglais\" (as they call every englishman) is sup posed to be so very rich, and so lavish of his treasures, that he is rather flattered than offended by the largeness of the sums which he is called upon to pay ; and, Avhile a conscientious trades man is satisfied with asking of another foreigner about forty or fifty ]>er cent beyond the value of his goods, he fails not to demand double of him, Avhom, by his accent, he discovers to be a native of that happy island, in Avhich frenchmen ber Jieve, that gold is as common as the air avp breathe.

MY DEAR SIR, Xlx'WING in my former letters endeaA'oured to give you some idea of the particular objects of greatest curiosity, I shall, in this last, take a ge neral vieAv of Paris, principally as compared Avith London. I shall begin Avith remarking, that of all the foreigners of different nations, Avho frequent this city, the english are those Avho are least satisfied Avith its pleasures, its occupations, and its man ners. For this many reasons may be assigned. The nations of the continent have, in the first place, in their mode of living, a kind of general resemblance, which qualifies them more for do mesticating (if I may be permitted the expression) jn a country not their OAvn than Ave have. A ger man, an italian, a russian, or a sAvede has been accustomed at home to the french kitchen, or at least to a bad imitation of its dishes': his habits, his fashions, and even his literary pursuits haA'e been formed on the model of the french : and if he has lived in a court, the french language has also"], [307, "LETTER XXXH. 283 been, from infancy, as familiar to him as his OAvn. Very different is the situation of an englishman. He finds himself, on landing at Calais, in a new world, and in all the ordinary occurrences of life, his habits are to be fresh modelled. The cleanliness, so generally prevalent in Eng land, not only in private houses but likewise in inns, taverns, and hotels, is seldom met with on the con tinent, and it is necessary for the traveller to lay aside his best customs, and most excusable pre judices, before he can become tolerably easy. To breakfast ancl dine in a bedroom, to eat Avith the same knife of every article, to have the bed made by a man, ancl other indelicacies too gross to mention, are little misfortunes to which an english gentleman submits with regret, and a lady Avith real pain. Ihe numerous but scanty dishes which croAvd a french table, among which a joint of plain roasted meat seldom appears, cloy Avithout satisfying the appetite of those who have been used to simpler but more substantial food. The Avine, also, notwithstanding its high repute, seldom seems strong enough or of sufficient body for such as are habitual drinkers of port, though, Avhen the latter has been for some time discon tinued, the taste becomes disagreeable. The familiarity of servants and waiters (though less than before the revolution), is still disgusting and offensive. The necessity of bargaining, even at the most respectable shops, for the com"], [308, "284 LETTER XXXII. monest articles of merchandize, renders the pur chase of them very unpleasant. These circum stances, hoAveA'er trifling, occur too frequently in the course of every day, not to have a consider able effect on the serenity of John Bull. Ac customed only to his OAvn language, he is either totally ignorant of the french, or speaks it with difficulty, hesitation, and fear. He is tormented with the frequent visits*, which he is expected * Visits.\u2014 It is the custom, in all parts of France, and particularly at Paris, to receive and pay perpetual visits. The whole of every evening is passed in a routine cf this kind (when the spectacle offers no irresistible temptation) ; and a Parisian belle was, the other day, quite astonished and dis gusted, when I told her, that in England ladies seldom re ceived the visits of young men\u2014\" Quelle vie ennuyeuse que votre vie de Londres!\" exclaimed the fair one; \" qu'on doit passer des trisles journees ! Que peut elle faire, une mal heureuse anglaise, apres diner ?\" \" Elle va aux assemblies ou a l'opera \u2014 Mais si elle est malade ? \" Elle reste chez elle.\" \" Quoi toute seule ! que vos dames sont a plaindrc ! Que Je me felicite d'etre francoisc ! Sans les visiles de quelques amis choisis, je mourrois d' ennui.\" What a dull Hfe must your english manners afford ! What dismal days must one pass in such a country ! What can a poor english lady do after dinner? She goes to assemblies, or to the opera, But if she is ill- She stays at home. What quite alone?

Oh, how I rejoice at being born a frenchwoman!"], [309, "LETTER XXXII. 285 to pay; and the custom of leaving the table im mediately after dinner, seldom alloAving time for more than one or tAvo glasses of good Avine, com pletely destroys the original good nature of his character. I have recapitulated these little distresses, as I am convinced they sour the temper, and have a considerable influence on the unfavourable judg ment often pronounced by my countrymen. I do not pretend myself to be superiour to such weaknesses, and mention the circumstance, that too implicit credit may not be given to the opi nions of one capable of being biassed by \"trifles light as air.\" I must be permitted, however, to observe, that there are reasons of a much more serious nature, Avhich make the english less easy to please than other foreigners. We come from a country, Avhere all the arts are carried to a degree of perfection, at least equal tb Avhat is attained on the same objects in France, and where, in many things, the ingenuity of our ma- without the visits of a few well chosen friends I should die of ennui. Notwithstanding this passion for receiving and returning visits among one another, the french are frequently neg ligent in this respect towards the foreigners who are re commended to them.

In science and lite rature Ave have not been compelled to look from home; and while we now admire the many distin guished Avriters which France has produced, they are not our only models, and Avith Locke and NeAvton, Milton and Shakspeare, we cannot pay that unbounded homage to the genius and learn in sr of our neighbours, Avhich they are apt to demand. The freedom and excellence of our constitution accustoms us to a degree of unrestrained conver sation, seldom met Avith at Paris; and the gene ral diffusion of wealth in London, has introduced, among all orders, a degree of comfort which is seldom found even in the proudest houses of the french capital. The beauty of our Avomen, and the delicacy of their behaviour, render us less enthusiastic admirers of parisian belles, ancl parisian fashions, than the stransrers of other countries. The perfection to Avhich the stage has advanced in London, and the splendid manner in Avhich our theatres are lighted, prevent our being greatly struck with the renowned spectacles of this place ; and the taste, profusion, and magnificence, dis played in our private entertainments, oppose too powerful a contrast to the gayeties of Paris, to allow us to be much delighted Avith the latter. Our race of horses, and our manufacture of carriages, are both too perfect to render it pos sible for us to admire the Avretched equipages,"], [311, "LETTER XXXII. 287 Avhich are here considered as the acme of ele gance. It is equally impossible for us to praise the gardens of the Thuilleries, the Champs Elisees, or the Bois de Boulogne, as long as we remember Hyde park or Kensington gardens. Nor can the lighting and paving of Paris excite the admiration of those avIio have been used to the comfortable trottoir and brilliant lamps of the streets of London. Having thus stated the reasons, good and bad, for the tameness with Avhich englishmen often speak of Paris, I shall endeavour to divest my self, as much as possible, of national prejudice, and to lay before you the advantages and disad vantages attendant on a residence in this city. In respect to literature, the arts and sciences, certainly every opportunity is offered Avhich knowledge can afford, or Avhich a zeal for letters can desire. In this respect, I think, Paris is su periour to London. Besides the immense ac quisitions Avhich it has lately made, and the great and wonderful collections that are constantly open to the public, there are so many private in stitutions Avithin the reach of men of moderate fortune, that this city would soon rival all the universities of Europe, did not the pleasures of the place hold out temptations dangerous to the morals of youth.

EA'en the haughtiest of the old nobility admit into their most intimate caieries, those who have attained any literary fame, hoAvever low their origin, or hoAvever mean their appear ance. On this head, I give unqualified and un rivalled praise to Paris. Whether a foreigner could profitably pursue any commercial speculation here, it is not for me to inquire. I shall only observe, that, notAvith standing the laws of equality, prejudices exist as strongly as eA'er at Paris ; ancl could a fortune be accumulated here as rapidly as in London, that fortune Avould never purchase the respect and consequence with Avhich a similar acquisition is attended in England. A merchant (or \" nego ciant,\" to rise the french expression) is still an insignificant character in this town, and all the wealth of India Avould not place him on a level Avith a general, a minister, or a ci-devant noble. A man of pleasure, or rather of dissipation, may, in all the joys of unbounded variety, de stroy his health, vitiate his principles, enervate his mind, and ruin his fortune.

The greater number of those who took an active part in the revolution, haA-e been swept away in the general torrent ; the few that remain, are either living in obscurity, and cautious of ex pressing their opinions, or become, like other apostates, as violent on one side as they Avere formerly on the other. Of course, no satisfac tory information is to be derived from them. As to the general bulk of the nation, passi\\'e under the iron tyranny of that sanguinary monster, Robespierre, they preferred, at that time, the accidental hope of individual escape, to the ge nerous ancl braA'er conduct of a bold resistance. They are still the same people ; and, noAv that their tranquillity and private happiness are se* cured, they look on in perfect apathy, and (if the term Avere not too rash) I should add, in sulky content. * Boulotte is a gambling game much played at Paris, and said to be the support of several families* U"], [314, "290 LETTER XXXII.

You cannot, living in England, form an idea of the indifference prevalent here about public matters. The time of Robespierre, or \"la regne de la terreur, \" as it is commonly called, is often the subject of conversation, and it is mentioned Avith as much disgust and horror as in other countries ; yet it neA-er seems to occur to any one, that in having been the tacit spectators and instruments of the murders committed at that time, the inha bitants of this country Avere parties to his crimes.

More than one person Avas taken from the dinner table, or the game of chess, to the place of execution. From a nation so strangely indifferent to its dearest interests, Avhat intelligence can you ex pect to collect ? If you ask a question relating to those dreadful moments, instead of a simple an- SAver of facts, you receive a violent philippic against the memory of a man, too infamous eA'en to deserve the honours of abuse.

They must re- member, that every thing is calculated in this town, and that, if the female traveller will not conciliate ihe masters of famities by her smiles, nor her husband by presents ancl attentions to the ladies, no door will be opened which is not forced open by the imperious command of some person, on Avhose power and interest the party depends. With the most insignificant title, or the lowest order of chivalry, something may be done, for these add to the splendour of an as- sembly; but without these advantages, and Avith- out vice, foreigners live but dully in this gay city. An english lady, of superiour talents, ob- served to me one day, with great truth, that she never discovered that her title of \" countess\"' was of any use, till she entered the territory of the french republic. I ought also to mention, that it seldom happens in this country, that a person, to Avhom a stranger is recommended, thinks it necessary to present him to another. Of course, the number of acquaintance will not exceed that of the letters with Avhich a foreigner is favoured. It may be doubtful, Avhether all of these will be attended to ; but, at any rate, the houses of those to Avhom he is addressed will form the limits .of his society. . Families coming here Avith children, will have great advantages"], [317, "293 LETTER XXXII. in procuring them education. Masters in eA'ery science, and in every language, may be had at a very easy expense. The only antidote is the temptation to pleasure. Under a certain age, no place can be so well suited to the purposes of instruction. Having takeu a hasty vieAv of the different situations in Avhich this town may be visited, I shall conclude my subject by enumerating in what I conceive London is superiour to Paris, and in what Paris is superiour to London. In width, cleanliness, ancl beauty, the streets of London have such a decided advantage over those of Paris, that I btlieve e\\'en a frenchman Avould acknowledge, that the question could not be disputed. The footpaths of the former, on which the pedestrian may walk Avithout danger or dirt; the exceUent pavement, Avhich preA'ents any fatigue from being experienced in the use of a carriage; and the brilliance of the lamps at night, Avhich renders the passage, in an eA'ening, from one part ofthe town to. another, rather a pleasure than a pain, ar.e but ill contrasted by the narrow ancl filthy lanes of the latter, in Avhich persons on foot are constantly exposed to every kind of accident and inconA'enience ; to the neg lected carriage Avays, in moving over which in dividuals are bruised, ancl Avheels rapidly Avorn out, and to the dismal and uncertain light, Avhich 3, few lanterns, hung by cords suspended from the u 3"], [318, "294 LETTER XXXIT. opposite houses, faintly affords. But if the streets of Paris must yield to those of London, th. former city is undoubtedly superiour in its palaces and public buildings, and in the height, style, and architecture of private houses, the stone fronts, regular plan, and lofty dimensions of Avhich, have a A'ery commanding appearance. But though the edifices are finer, and the ar rangement more conAenient, each floor con sisting of a complete set of rooms, yet, from their great size, it usually happens that the same house is inhabited by several families, and the stairs, consequently, becoming public, are as dirty and as disgusting as the common streets. Where too an individual keeps an entire house in his possession, the number of his servants is rarely proportioned to the size of his habitation, and either only a part is occupied, or the whole is neglected and in bad order, I cannot help adding, as a singular circum stance, that notAvithstanding the extensive and superiour scale on Avhich private hotels are built at Paris, I have seldom seen open, at an assembly here, either as many rooms, or those of such large dimensions, as are met with, on similar occasions,, in families of rank and fashion ii> London. The season of this apparent contra diction, perhaps, is this, that as but one floor (whether others belong to the same person or jiQty is generally made use of, the bed rooms,"], [319, "LETTER XXXII. 295 offices, and antichamber, occupy too large a space to allow much extent for the apartments devoted to the reception of company. From the opposite reason, it often happens that a house in London, of moderate size, has several large rooms, m which a numerous society may be entertained, though these rooms are scattered on different floors. In respect to furniture, the houses of the \" parvenus\" are elegantly and splendidly fitted up. Most of the other private hotels have re ceived little improvement, repair, or alteration, since the beginning of the revolution, and are consequently not very remarkable, either for freshness or novelty of taste. Carpets .are not common; and though the beds are generally better, and in a more ornamental form, than those usually seen in England, and the antique shapes are most classically imitated in the de coration of these, and in the chairs, or fauteuils; yet, in other respects, I think our modern man ner of fitting up houses has the advantage over that Avhich generally prevails at Paris. Ma hogany, so commonly used in England for dinner tables, is seldom applied to that purpose in France; and, as the cloth is never removed, they are made of deal. En revanche it forms, in stead of gold, the frames of satin furniture; and the Avails of drawing rooms are often ornamented with that wood. I cannot say, I admire ma- v 4"], [320, "296 LETTER XXXir. hogany thus employed; but this is entirely a matter of taste. Plate glass is, of course, very superiour, ancl infinitely more common in the decoration of rooms than in England; yet, with this exception, and a feAV others, I think our apartments in London are more completely fur nished, are much cleaner, ancl have many little comforts Avhich are wanting in those of Paris. Some particular houses here do, indeed, present models of taste, profusion, and luxury, un equalled by any of ours j but the number of these is very trifling, and alters but, little the general result. The eating rooms of french houses are very disgusting. Instead of the comfortable turkey carpet, handsome curtains, stuccoed walls, blaz-r ing firej and ornamented sideboard, of a London parlour, the dinner is here served in a dark and gloomy apartment, called \" la salle a manger,\" imperfectly heated with a stOA'e, the floor gene rally of stone, and always Avithout a carpet, the Avindows without curtains or shutters, and the Avhole dirty and uninviting. Where there is not a separate antichamber, the servants occupy the dining rooms in the absence of their masters; and, in that case, the smell, which such company are apt to leave, is extremely offensive. Of the assemblies I have already spoken. Ex cepting a great ball given by madame Recamier, where there was a crowd of three or four hundred 1"], [321, "297 LETTER XXXII. persons of different classes, Avith only a stand ing or s-:i)iikckli supper, and a superb fete given by monsieur de Diinidoff, a rich russian, I have heard of no very numerous party. The balls ge nerally consist of from fifty to a hundred people. Those at Avhich 1 xvas present, appeared rather calculated to show the dancing and dress of the ladies, than to promote general gayety or diver sion. In splendour of costume, and in graceful movements, our entertainments of this sort must yield to those of Paris; but in general mirth, in decorations, in supper, and brilliancy of light, the comparison is decidedly in favour of the for mer. The constant fluctuation also which takes place in London, from the number of engage ments of each individual, gives a A-ariety which is wanting in a french party, at which all the in vited pass their whole evening. The this, Avhich answer, in some respects, to our card parties, are infinitely less in number than the latter. The conversation of the former is, undoubtedly, on subjects more Avorthy of oc cupying the attention of rational beings, than the senseless chit chat of our fashionable coteries. It is only to be regretted, that the desire of speaking on literary subjects with eclat, so gene rally prevalent at Paris, not unfrequently dege nerates into pedantry aud affectation. Hence the tasteless coiner ofpompous sentences is often jnistaken for a man of genius; and the chattering"], [322, "298 LETTER XXXII. ostentatious coxcomb is admired, while the silence of modesty, and the reflection of good sense, expose those in whom they are discovered, sometimes to ridicule, and always to neglect. The conversation too, is Commonly monopo lised by a few, and the rest of the company yawn away their evening uninterested and unin teresting. On this subject the higher classes, of both countries, might improve, by observing the faults of each other ; those of England, in ren* dering the topics of their conversation Jess trifling; and those of France, by letting ideas, instead of expressions, occupy their attention. The concerts here are dull and tiresome enter tainments, Avhich last fi\\'e or six hours uninter ruptedly. Young ladies are often the principal performers, and admired rather in proportion to their rank and fashion than to the harmony of their voice, or the scientifical proficiency Avhich they ha\\re made in the study of music. As Ave ha\\-e generally in London the first kalian masters, and the most distinguished singers, I conceive that our amusements of this sort must be supe riour to those of Paris. Of the spectacles I have fully spoken in a for mer letter. I shall, therefore, be as concise as possible at present. The opera of Paris is supe riour to that of London in dancing and decora tion; but the latter, in point of brilliance, gayety; music, beauty, and elegance of company, has"], [323, "LETTER XXXII. 299 such an advantage over the former, that it may be justly said to be, in the language of Shakspeare, \" Hyperion to a satyr.\" As to the play-houses, the comic performers in France possess a degree of extraordinary merit, and of professional skill, which I do not conceiA'e any theatre of Europe can equal; but if they have attained a higher point of perfection than our actors in that line, I think our tragedians as decidedly exceed the french in simplicity of diction ancl of manner, in the just representation of human passions, and, above all, in taking nature for their guide, Avhich, in assum ing the buskin, the latter seem entirely to forget. As to the general state of the spectacles as public places, those of Xondon are infinitely gayer, but those of Paris more orderly, and less subject to riots, indecency, and disturbance. The Avalks, or promenades, of both these great cities, are delightful. Ours have the singular merit of being pleasant even in Avinter; and, be sides, our large streets, the footAvays of Avhich, eAren after rain, are soon dry, with the gar dens of our various squares and inns of court, St. James's and Hyde park offer constant and beautiful spots for exercise. At Paris, there are no trottoirs; and the Thuilleries, Champs Elis^es, and Boulevards, are almost impassable for foot passengers in bad Aveather. When the spring begins, the scene changes, and this city then Roasts some charming gardens, Avhich I have al-"], [324, "300 LETTER XXXII. ready enumerated, and Avhich are Avell frequented. In my opinion, however, there is nothing here to be compared either Avith Hyde park or Kensington gardens. For excursions round the toAvn, the neighbour hood of London seems to afford more variety and picturesque vieAvs than that of Paris; but the*vi cinity of both cities is very beautiful. The hours of the two capitals are now so nearly alike, that it is unnecessary to draw a comparison between them. No genteel family at Paris dines before four or five o'clock, and some persons not till six or seven. The this begin about nine, the balls at twelve. The theatres commence at seven, ancl are generally over between ten and eleven. The shops of London, as well as every kind of trade ancl manufactory, are so decidedly superiour to those of Paris, that it would be ridiculous to make the subject a question of doubt. There have been, hoAvevtr, some very elegant \" ma gazins\" (or shops) lately opened in la Rue de la Loi (ci-devant de Richelieu), particularly that of M. le Roi, and another called \" la Maison de la Providence,\" nearly opposite la Rue de Feydeau. Hackney coaches are a convenience Avhich both these cities enjoy in great perfection. Those of Paris have -improved so much since the re volution, that I conceive them now to be su*"], [325, "301 LETTER XXXII. periour to ours, both in carriages ancl horses. The fare for one distance Cor \" course,\") whe ther long or short, provided it be Avithin the gates of Paris, is thirty sols (or one shilling and three-pence english). There are, besides these, \" cabriolets,\" or open carriages, con stantly plying, Avhich are not only good, but un commonly elegant. They are equal to the best appointed gigs of private persons in London. The horses are fleet, ami the drivers civil. The fare is something more than that of a \" fiacre,\" or hackney coach. The \" hotels gain is\" are not so good or so numerous as they Avere foi merly; but I think them still better than our houses cf the same kind in London. There is also a privacy in a french apartment (the outward door of each making a distinct habitation), which gives it a decided adA'antage over the lodgings of an english hotel. The public rooms and private cabinets of \" restaurateurs,\" are certainly more elegantly fitted up than the apartments of our taverns or coffeehouses. The cooking of the former is better, and presents a much greater variety of dishes, and the affixed price to each article, makes the price of a dinner depend entirely on the choice of him by Avhom it is ordered. As to society, that material ingredient in the happiness of man, of which every one who has"], [326, "302 LETTER XXXIT. a head or heart, feels the vast importance, I con ceive that foreigners arriving either in London or in Paris, Avithout pressing recommendations or exalted rank, may be much embarassed, and may in both places pass months and even years, without making one proper acquaintance. Yet it appears to me that there is this great and dis tinguishing difference between the manners of the two capitals, that a person properly intro duced to a few families of fashion in London, will rapidly find his Avay into every society Avhich he wishes to frequent, Avhereas, in Paris, hoAv ever Avell individuals may be received in one or two of the most esteemed houses, that circum stance Avil! not contribute to their introduction to any others, and if a stranger arrives Avith a certain number of recommendations, he may, after a six months residence, quit Paris Avithout having in creased the list of his acquaintance. I speak on this subject from experience.

AVe had the p.easure of passing some days at her country seat, in the valley of Montmorency, and several evenings at her hotel at Paris.

He is still living, and is a respectable man of ancient family, independent fortune, and irreproachable re putation.

Our hospitals and asylums for suffering poverty, are too well known, and stand on too high a basis to require any eulogium from me. 1 am happy to add, that those of Paris have not been neg lected during the united horrors of Avar and re volution. A respectable physician (not a french man) assures me, that even during the most barbarous moments of the sanguinary Robes pierre, these useful establishments were not aban doned. By a strange contradiction, Avhile virtue and innocence were daily dragged to the scaffold, misery here found a refuge from the agonies of pain, and the menaces of disease. These insti tutions are now kept up Avith liberality, and every possible attention. Besides several others the me dical gentleman in question particularly praises \" l'Hotel Dieu, rue du Marche Palu,\" where from fifteen hundred to two thousand sick per sons receive the advice of the ablest physicians, and are treated Avith the most delicate care. The government, and the persons particularly entrusted with the management of this establishment, show the most laudable zeal in its support. \" L'llos pice St. Louis\"''is an excellent appendage to this, to Avhich those whose complaints arc contagious are immediately removed. He next commends"], [329, "LETTER XXXII. 305 \"PHospice de la Pitie, rue Foss6s St. Victor,\" behind \"le Jardin des Plantes,\" the refuge of distressed innocence, in which two thousand chil dren of soldiers, Avho died in the service of their country, are rescued from misery, and comfort ably supported. \" L'Hospice de St. Sulpice, rue deSeVres,\" originally built by madame Necker, in Avhich one hundred and twenty sick, and eigh teen Avounded persons are relieved. \" L'Hospice des Incurables,\" Avhere the doom of these un happy Avretches is softened by an extensiA'e gar den ; and \" l'Hospice de la Salp6trit:re,\" built by Louis XIII, ancl maintained at present in all its original grandeur. The building is fine,>p resen t ing a majestic facade, and its boundaries are so extensiA'e that it is almost a little city. Here six teen hundred girls are employed in making linen and in Avorking lace. Old married men, young Avomen affected with madness, and female ideots here receive those little comforts, of which their respective situations still allow them to partake. Requesting you to pardon this digression I shall conclude my subject Avith a few short observations drawn from my former remarks. To those Avho are fond of the arts, ancl Avho deA'ote their time to the pursuit, Paris offers ob jects of great interest and unequalled beauty. Persons who pass their lives in a career of dissi pation, Avho are satisfied with public amusements, D0ught pleasures, and high play, will find nere, x"], [330, "306 LETTER XXXII. decked in all the joys of variety, the means of gratifying their favourite Avishes. To such as come to vieAv the curiosities of the place, Paris Avill appear delightful during a residence of tAvo or three months, as that time will be fully and agreeably occupied in examining its various insti- tutions, and in visiting its different theatres, parti- cularly if the traveller arrives in the beginning of spring, when the charms of nature are added to those of art. But to him Avhose attachments are centred Avithin the circle of his own family, avIio is fond of the inA'estigation of truth, and whose early clays have been passed in the polished so- cieties of London, Paris, after its great and striking beauties have once been sufficiently view- ed, will appear comparatively tame, dull, and uninteresting. He Avill daily miss the freedom of conversation, Which is so generally prevalent in England ; he Avill look in vain for that mani}' sense, with which great national questions are dis- cussed by men of education in London, he will be irritated by the flippancy of french politicians, and by the pedantic terms and laboured sen- tences, Avhich take the place of sound argument and solid reasoning. He will find the amuse- ments rather various than splendid. He \"will find society difficult when it is good, and dangerous Avhen it is easy*. He Avill admire the grace 1 * There are innumerable houses at Paris in which, witli every appearance of respectability, and often with the assist- 1"], [331, "LETTER XXXII. 307 and elegance of the ladies, and will look with an eye of pity, if not of contempt, on the indelicacy of their dress. He will hear \" la bonne com pagnie\" talked of in every set, and never defined. He will perhaps at last discover that it only ex ists, where it does not assume the name, or as Voltaire says, \" Quine s'appellepas la bonne compagnie, mais qui Test.\" He Avih view with wonder and admiration the works of art, and see Avith no little pleasure and curiosity the extraordinary man now at the head of government. Such will be his principal sources of satisfaction at Paris. He will soon discover that every thing else, hoAvever blazoned out in the trappings of grandeur, or vamped up in the colouring of hyperbole, is only \" air and empty nothing.\" Adieu, my dear sir, I propose setting out to morroAv morning for Lyons and Switzerland. You will, therefore, not hear from me again till I am far distant from this capital. I came here big with hope, and eager in expectation. I re- ance of some lofty sounding title, the unwary stranger often finds his ruin. Amidst the smiles of beauty, the splendour of foreign orders, tlie jollity of wine, and the gaiety of dancing, youth loses its prudence, and one e\\ening's enter tainment is paid by the loss of that fortune, on which a man's happiness, and perhaps that of many dear relatives de pended.
