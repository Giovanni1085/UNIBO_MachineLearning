The information in these pages relative to the memorable insurrection under Cade's leadership was only made public for the first time last year. My own researches amongst the Guildhall Records were notified in the Transac tions of the London and Middlesex Arch\u00e6ological Society. The labours of Mr. Durrant Cooper, F.S.A., amongst the State Records were inserted in the Trans actions of the Arch\u00e6ological Societies of Kent and Sussex. It appeared to me, that the facts thus acquired merited preservation in a distinct form, and with Mr. Durrant Cooper's assent I determined on re printing them together. Why Thomas Cooke, draper, a young citizen from Suffolk, should have been selected as the London agent for a great rebellion we can only conjecture. It was probably due to a native vigour and resolu-"], [12, "PREFACE. VI tion of character, which won attention at a critical moment, when the services of such a man were specially needed by the Yorkist faction. Among the descendants of this eminent citizen we find not only such illustrious men as Francis Bacon and Robert Cecil, but the names also of a multitude of departed worthies who have won a notable position in our national annals. Amongst living men some of these descendants occupy the highest rank in the Peerage ; others have made their mark in the House of Commons. I have printed some letters of Lord Bacon that I found among the correspondence at Guildhall. Two of these letters refer to a claim of King James the First to nominate the Bailiff of Ossulston hundred. I pointed out the existence of these letters to the learned Town Clerk of London, who informed me that no such officer was now appointed by the Cor poration, nor had any such appointment been made in his memory. I called the attention of my learned friend Mr. W. H. Black, F. S.A., late Assistant- Keeper of the Public Records, to Lord Bacon's letters on the subject, and he was good enough to favour me with a reply as follows : \u2014 The county of Middlesex was granted to the citizens of Lon don by King John's third Charter, dated 5 July, in his first year,"], [13, "PREFACE. VII by the name of the \" SherifFwick of London and Middlesex, with all the customs and things to the SherifFwick belonging, within the city and without, by land and by water, for the annual fee farm rent of 300/. payable half-yearly.\" This was not a new grant, but a confirmation of what had been enjoyed \" in antient times,\" and it was made to the citizens and their heirs. Hence the bailie wick of the hundred, and especially of the hundred of Ossulston, within which the city is locally situate (though not a part thereof), must have been an appurtenance or right of the shrievalty, and the Crown would have no right of appointment. The Crown could only exercise rights over its own demesnes in the county. See a translation of the Charter in Maitland, i. 74, 75, edit. 1772. I have not the original Latin before me, but I well re member copying the original at Guildhall in 1833. W. H. Black. It will be observed that Lord Bacon's opinion on this claim is uncalled-for and evasive. It appears as though the mere contact with such a king as James the First was detrimental to the nobler part of Bacon's nature. Lord Macaulay remarks that \" the indignation excited by the claims James put forward, and the scorn excited by his concessions, went on growing together. By his fondness for worthless minions, and by the sanction he gave to their tyranny, he kept discontent constantly alive. It was no light thing, that, on the very eve of the decisive struggle between our kings and their parliaments,"], [14, "PREFACE.

Certainly the language of King James the First to the shrewd monev - Hiakins; traders of London, imbued at the time with puritanical feelings, was the extreme of folly, and affords a striking contrast to the strong will and determination of purpose of the great Elizabeth.

The archives of the little town of Stratford-on-Avon have been closely scrutinized with the view of eliciting any circum stance that is linked with the name, or has a bearing on the family connections, of Shakespeare. But it is doubtful whether the records of the Corporation of London have ever been exa mined with the same energetic interest in reference to either of Shakespeare's great contemporaries, the illustrious author of Inductive Science, or his cousin, the renowned statesman Robert Cecil. The name of Bacon is one of great antiquity in the city of London, and frequently occurs in many of the most ancient of the records belonging to the Corporation. Among others, in 1284, we find that Nicholas Bacon, painter, acknowledged that he was bound to Hugh Motun, City Chamberlain, in the sum of twenty shillings for ciniple, vermilion, canvas, varnish and verdi gris;* and in 1347 Richard Bacon served as one of the Common Council for Bridge Ward. I have also found among them the election of William Bacon as Alderman of Coleman Street Ward in 1479, f and of James Bacon (the brother of the Lord Keeper) on the 22nd April, 9th Elizabeth, when the inhabitants of Aldersgate Ward, having (in the place of Lionel Duckett) nomi- * Mr. Riley, in Memorials of London and London Life, remarks that there is probably no earlier passage in existence having reference to varnish painting on canvas. f Corporation Records, Journal 8, sol. 232 b.

My principal desire, however, is to invite the attention of the reader to some particulars relating to the two eminent citizens and aldermen of London who were the progenitors not only of Francis Bacon and of Robert Cecil, but also of many other dis tinguished persons. Philip Malpas and Thomas Cooke lived in times of great poli tical strife, and it would seem entertained widely different political opinions : both witnessed the commencement of the fatal conten tions between the rival houses of York and Lancaster, and one certainly lived through the severest part of the national commotion, but both were the victims of gross wrong and oppression. Philip Malpas, draper, was Sheriff of London in 1439-40, and represented the City in the Parliament of 1441. A search made by me in the civic archives has disclosed some curious facts relative to his election as an alderman. On the 26th February, 1448 (26th Henry VI.), the commonalty of the Ward of Lime Street presented four persons to the Court of Aldermen, viz. : Philip Malpas, Thomas Beaumond, William Dere, and Christo- * Alderman Bacon was sheriff in 1568.

Francis Barnham was therefore grandfather of Lady Bacon. % Lives of the Judges, vol. v. p. 447."], [21, "3 ALDERMAN SIR THOMAS COOKE, K.B. pher Warter, for one of them, according to the custom of the time, to be chosen alderman of that ward ; but the nomination was rejected, because the Court of Aldermen affirmed that they were all unfit for the office ! * It may be inferred from this decision that the majority of the Court of Aldermen were, even at that early period, opposed to the Lancastrian interests, and desired to exclude Malpas from their body. If it were so, their opposition to him w7as for the time rendered nugatory by the personal intervention of the King ; for on the 1st of April following, it is recorded, that, \" on contemplation of divers Royal Letters upon the fitness and special recommendation of the person of the said Philip Malpas to the Mayor and Aldermen directed, the same Philip Malpas was elected by them as Alder man of the said ward, and sworn, as is meet,\" f &c. ; but the following salvo is added to the entry, viz. : \" So that this admis sion of the aforesaid Alderman be in no wise held as an example to expel the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being in future from the liberty to elect any Alderman whomsoever,\" &c. I find also the following curious fact noted in the Corporation Records : \u2014 \" At a Common Council, held the 26th June, 1450, a petition was presented from the commonalty that Philip Malpas should be exonerated from his office of alderman, and the request of the petitioners was conceded to them.\"| The solution of this riddle may be found in the fact of the rising of the Commons of Kent under Jack Cade, his approach to London, and the absence of Henry VI. at Kenilworth. Of course the Court of Common Council had no right to dismiss an alderman ; and the expulsion of Malpas was one of those violent party assump tions that always attend civil war. It is in connection with this outbreak that we meet with the name of Thomas Cooke, draper, as the London agent of Cade. It may be assumed that Cooke had previously attained a posi tion of some influence and note in the City, and carried on the business of a draper ; for he was one of the four wardens of the Drapers' Company in 1439, when they obtained a Charter of * Corporation Records, Journal 4, sol. 208 b. t Journal, v. sol. 38b. f Ibid. sol. 213?/.

The main object of the insurrection (Dr. Hook says) was not a change of dynasty, but to effect such a change of ministry as would place the Court under the control of the Yorkists.} \"Jack Cade encamped on Blackheath. between Eltham and Greenwich, on the 1st of June, 1450. Here, while he maintained his people by pillaging the country, he opened a communication with the City, styling him self the Captain of the Commons. All business was transacted in an orderly manner. Passports were duly signed, and Thomas Cooke, of London, draper, was constituted the captain's agent. He was required to tax the foreigners \u2014 the Genoese, Venetian, and Florentine merchants. They were to be duly convened, and were required to supply 'us, the Captain,' with 12 harnesses of the best fashion, 24 brigandines, 12 battle-axes, 12 glades, 6 horses with saddle and bridle completely harnessed, and a thou sand marks in ready money.

We are told by Fabyan that Alderman Home was committed by another court on the 2nd of July, and we find these two eminent mem bers of the Lancastrian party were selected by Cade for attack on the second day after his entrance into the city. That he or his followers committed several murderous acts, and made free with the property of the citizens, cannot be doubted.} Fabyan's account is, that he \" went into the house of Philip Malpas, draper and alderman, and robbed and spoiled his house, and took thence a great substance ; but he was forewarned, and thereby conveyed much of his money and plate, or else he had been undone.

The next trace we have of Alderman Malpas is in the year 1461, when, notwithstanding that the battle fought at St. Alban's * July 1450. f Chronicle, p. 623. t Whether Cade was unable to control his followers, or unable to control him- self, may be doubtful.

Durrant Cooper, F.S.A., clearly exhibit the fact that the insurgent body of which Cade was the leader partook very much of the character of a duly authorised army. The musters were levied by the constables in many of the hundreds, and the insurgents included a great num ber of the gentry and yeomen of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey; the Abbot of Battle, the Prior of Lewes, and a few other ecclesiastics. Mr. Cooper points out that the House of Commons (in 1439) had previously called the attention of the Government to the murders, rapes, robberies, and burnings that were causing discontent among the people in certain districts. The fact of the house of Philip Malpas being ransacked by Cade seems unquestionable ; and indeed, from a record preserved in the Treasury of the Exchequer, Mr. Cooper proves that Malpas actually obtained again by purchase from the Treasury some of the goods seized in his house by Cade. The evidence adduced by Mr. Cooper clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy of Holinshed. It is not true that the men deserted their leaders as soon as shown their pardon. On the morning after the indecisive engagement on London Bridge (6th July) negociations were opened with Cade in the church of St. Margaret, Southwark,* for \" a charter of pardon from the King for them all;\" Cade, as a preliminary, insisting on and obtaining the acceptance by the Chancellor and Bishop Waynfleet of the Bill of Petitions which had been refused by the Privy Council. In his own pardon, which is dated the same day (Monday) as the negociations, Cade is de signated John Mortimer. Mr. Cooper remarks : \" If Cade had * For a detailed account of these negociations see the Chronicles of William of Wyrcester, p. 76 et seg."], [25, "ALDERMAN SIR THOMAS COOKE, K.B. 7 been the low-born person he has been represented, no act of attainder would have been of any operation against his lands and tenements, nor would it have been of importance to declare his blood corrupt.\" It is abundantly clear that when \" Thomas Cooke of London, draper,\" was appointed the London agent of John Cade and his associates* he really assumed a most difficult and important task, which could hardly have been offered to any man unless he had great influence, ability, and judgment. We may infer, from the date of his will and the time when probate was granted, that Malpas died either the latter end of April or the beginning of May 1469.

This will was proved at Lambeth, the 8th day of May, 1469. Returning to Thomas Cooke, it appears that in 1453 (five vears after Malpas became alderman, and three years after Jack Cade's rebellion), he was elected as Sheriff; three years later he was chosen as Alderman of the Ward of Vintry; and in the C 2"], [30, "12 ALDERMAN PHILIP MALPAS AND year 1462-3 he filled the office of Lord Mayor. At the time of the coronation of Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV., in May 1465, Cooke was created a knight of the Bath, and the same honour was also conferred upon the then Lord Mayor, Ralph Jocelyn (brother-in-law to Cooke and ancestor of the Earl of Roden), and some other citizens. Sir Thomas Cooke was evidently a man of considerable wealth, and in high favour at Court. In 1467 he began to build a mansion called Gidea Hall, near Romford in Essex, and obtained a licence for fortifying and embattling it ; but on account of his subsequent misfortunes he completed only the front, the remainder being built by one of his descendants.* The tyranny exercised by Edward IV. against those persons whose riches held out a temptation to visit them with the sus picion of a connection with the House of Lancaster is the subject of severe reprehension by the old historians, and Sir Thomas Cooke was a notable victim. In 1467 he was impeached of high treason, at the instance of one Hawkins, who, having some years previously requested a loan of him of one thousand marks, upon good security, Sir Thomas answered that he would first know for whom it was and for what intent ; when, understanding it was for the use of Queen Margaret (wife of Henry VI.), he told Hawkins that he had no goods that he could convert into money without too much loss, and refused to lend even a hundred pounds ; but at the request of the Lady Margaret, sister to the King, he was admitted to bail. No sooner, however, had that royal lady left England, to be married to Charles Duke of Burgundy, than Cooke was again arrested, and sent to the Tower, his effects seized by Lord Rivers, the Queen's father, then Treasurer of England, and his wife com mitted to the custody of the then Mayor. Sir Thomas was shortly after tried at Guildhall and acquitted. But on his ac quittal he was sent to the Bread Street Compter, and from thence to the King's Bench, and was there kept until he paid \u00a38 000 to the King and \u00a3800 to the Queen. His wife, on regaining possession of his house after acquittal \" found it in very evil plight, for the servants of Lord Rivers * Lysons's Environs, vol. iv. p. 186."], [31, "13 ALDERMAN SIR THOMAS COOKE, K.B. and of Sir John Fagge (then Under- Treasurer), had made havoc of what they listed. Also at Gidea Hall, Essex, they had de stroyed the deer in his park, his conies and fish, and spared not brass, pewter, bedding, nor all they could carry away ; for which never a penny was gotten back in recompense.\"* It is stated by Fabyan and the other chroniclers that Lord Rivers and his wife the Duchess of Bedford obtained the dis missal of Chief Justice Markham from his office, for having determined that Cooke was not guilty of treason. The City Records show that, on the 21st November, 1468, Sir Thomas Cooke was discharged from the office of alderman, on the King's mandate, and that he was reinstated in October of the following year. On the temporary restoration of Henry VI., in a Parlia ment which met on the 26th of November, 1470, and of which he appears to have been a member, Cooke \" put in a byll into the comon house to be restoryd of the lord Ryuers, and other occacioners of his trouble,\" lands to the sum of 22,000 marks, of \" whiche he had good comfort to haue ben allowyd of King Henry if he had prosperyd.\"f \"And the rather \" (adds the chronicler) \"for y* he was of the comon house, and therewith a man of great boldnesse of speke and well spoken, and syngulerly wytted and well reasoned.\"} As King Henry's restored rule was but of short duration, it is clear this appeal met with no success. In the beginning of the following year, 1471, \"the mayer\" ( Sir John Stockton) \" ferynge the retoume of kynge Edwarde, fayn hym syke, and so kept his house a great season, all which tyme sir Thomas Cooke, whiche thenne was admytted to his former rome, was sette in his place, and allowyed for his deputie, whiche tourned after to his great trouble and sorowe.\"\u00a7 Edward did return * There is a feminine ring about this passage that makes one fancy the language that of Lady Cooke herself. + Eabyan's Chronicle, p. 660. t The early and the modern historians appear to have been alike appalled by the fact that there has never been any but a very imperfect index to the Guild hall papers. I rejoice to say that I carried an inquiry on this subject in the Court of Common Council, and I believe very important information will be, as a consequence, obtainable on the report of the Committee. \u00a7 Fabyan's Chronicle, p. 660."], [32, "14 ALDERMAN PHILIP MALPAS AND and resumed possession of the throne in the month of April, and Sir Thomas Cooke, attempting flight by leaving this country for France, was taken by a ship of Flanders, and his son and heir with him, and so set there in prison many days, and lastly was delivered up to King Edward. It is also said that the goods of Sir Thomas Cooke were again seized, and his wife put forth, and commanded to be kept at the mayor's.* How long this state of things lasted, and what events happened to Cooke subsequently, I have not been able to trace ; but it is clear from the amount of property he died possessed of, that, though he may have been heavily fined, he was not reduced to poverty. When upon the death of Edward IV. Richard Duke of Gloucester made known his ambitious designs upon the throne, we are told that the Duke of Buckingham was sent into the city to deliver an oration to the assembled citizens in their Guildhall, in order to incite them to favour Richard's projects. In this speech Buckingham dwelt on topics which he knew would come home to the feelings of those whom he was addressing, and amongst other subjects he spoke with much force of the injuries which Sir Thomas Cooke had sustained at the hands of the late King. The following extract from the account handed to us of the duke's speech on this subject may not be deemed uninteresting: \" What Cooke,\" he exclaims, \" your owne worshipful neighbour, alderman, and maior of this noble citie ! who is of you so either negligent that he knoweth not, or so forgetful that he remembreth not, or so hard-hearted that he pittieth not that worshipful man's losse ? What speake we of losse? His vtter spoile and vndeserued destruction, onelie for that it hapned those to fauour him whome the prince fauoured not.'f * Fabyan's Chronicle, p. 662. f Does this point to any special friendship with the Earl of Warwick (the king-maker)? A modern writer expresses his surprise at the influence the earl exercised in the City. May not this have been through Sir Thomas Cooke ? Had Warwick anything to do with Cooke's negociations with Jack Cade ? We know that when Warwick quarrelled with Edward IV. and brought back Henry VI. Cooke was made acting Lord Mayor. It is probable that if the Cor poration decide upon a careful scrutiny of the City archives many interesting facts relative to the History of England during the Wars of the Roses will be brought to light. I sincerely hope that the attention of Mr. H. T. Riley may be directed to this subject."], [33, "15 ALDERMAN SIR THOMAS COOKE, K.B.

OF THE SUSSEX AND MIDDLESEX ARCH\u00c6OLOGICAL SOCIETIES, ETC. ETC. A meeting of the Kent Arch\u00e6ological Society at Ashford would have been incomplete, if there had been no notice taken of the great rising in 1450 of the \" Commons of Kent,\" under Cade, their \" captain,\" who has been called (though erroneously) \" the Tanner of Ashford.\" Ashford and its neighbourhood was undoubtedly the heart of the rising, and it was generally supported throughout the lathe of Scray, as it was also in the lathes of Aylesford and Sutton at Hone. There were comparatively few places in the lathe of Shepway, from whence adherents were drawn to the cause ; and, with the exception of the hundreds of Eastry, Petham, Preston, Wingham, and the Isle of Thanet, the lathe of St. Augustine was free from the rising. The particulars relating to this rising, \u2014 the dates of the chief events, the station of the persons engaged, the extent of the dis tricts in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Essex, from which contin gents came, and the time of the pardons under which the great body dispersed, \u2014 have all been involved in doubt and obscurity. Yet the Patent Roll of 28th Hen. VI. (part 2, m. 13, etc.), contains the materials for supplying many of these wanting par ticulars. It has upon it the names of many hundreds of forces of the therein acknowledged \" John Mortimer's\" followers, who were pardoned, and in many cases their designations and trades. It has been admitted, indeed, that Cade drew to himself some \" tall men\" of this county ; yet it is not known how many were of old and good families, many remaining to this day. It is worth while at the outset to give their names."], [45, "JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN KENT. 25 There was 1 Knight \u2014 *Cheyne, John, of East Church, in the Isle of Sheppey. 18 Esquires also appear, viz. : \u2014 Hexstall, William, of East Peckham.1 Ysaake, John, of Patrykesbourne.2 Pympe, Thomas, of All Saints, in the Hundred of Hoo.

The names of the yeomen are very numerous, and several of them have risen to the rank of gentry, such as the Courthopes, Tonges, Springetts, and Woodgates : whilst some of the old names, such as the Septvans, now lost, were then to be found. It was not a disorganised mob, nor a chance gathering. In several Hundreds the constables duly, and as if legally, sum moned the men ; and many parishes, particularly Marden, Pens hurst,1 Hawkhurst, Northfleet, Boughton-Malherbe, Smarden, and Pluckley, furnished as many men as could be found, in our own day, fit for arms. Among those pardoned are the towns of Canterbury, Chatham, Maidstone, Rochester, and Sandwich ; John Browne, the Bailiff of Folkestone, and John Cockeram, the Mayor of the new town of Queenborough ; the constables of the Hundreds of Eastry, Petham, Preston, Ringslowe,2 and Wing ham, in the lathe of St. Augustine ; of Chatham, Gillingham, Hoo, Littlefield, Maidstone, Shamwell, Thwyford, and Wrotham, in the lathe of Aylesford ; of Boughton-under-Chart, Long bridge, Felborough, Milton, and Teynham, in the lathe of Scray; of Langport, in the lathe of Shepway ; of Dartford, Blackheath, Bromley, Beckenham, Codsheath, Lessness, Ruxley, and Somer den, in the lathe of Sutton at Hone. In East Greenwich and Dartford, which were close to the Camp at Blackheath, the wives of many men were included in the pardons, having doubtless entertained the men assembled in arms. In Sussex the Abbot of Battle and the Prior of Lewes partici pated in the rising;3 but in Kent the only names of ecclesiastics which appear are five, viz. : Clerke, John, Parson of the church of Halgeste, in the Hundred of Hoo, in three pardons. Changle, Thomas, of Yalding. Spencer, Henry, Chaplain of Cowling. Boteler, John, of Boughton Malherbe. Penyngton, William, Chaplain of Osprynge. 1 Penshurst, at this time, belonged to the exiled Duke of Buckingham. 2 One is John Septvans. 3 See pod, where the pardons for Sussex are given."], [49, "JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN KENT. 29 And two \" Holy-water clerkes,\" being the persons who carried the holy water. Among the occupations are some which mark the transition of the English language ; thus Butchers, in most parishes, are in others called Fleshers ; Cordwainer and Corvesor are used indis criminately ; Sonderer, otherwise Baker or New Baker ; Ripiers, who carried the fish to London ; Ferrour for farrier, and Putter for the carriers of wood to make charcoal.

The fullers and tanners are also here, and chapmen, haberdashars, drapers, mercers, tailors, and glovers ; chandlers, and wax- and tallow-chandlers ; grocers, spicers, and bakers ; braziers, tinkers, sawyers, carpenters, masons, tilers, thatchers, turners, smiths, coopers, and saddlers ; of barbers, more than a dozen; and brewers, innholders, vintners, and taverners ; a solitary hackney-man, two grooms, and a servant. As might be anticipated in a maritime county, there are ship men, watermen, and mariners. The manufactures are repre sented by clothmakers and webbes, or weavers in Smarden and Pluckley. In many parishes the occupations are not given ; but the main force consisted of husbandmen and labourers. It is incorrectly stated by Holinshed that the men abruptly withdrew themselves and deserted Cade so soon as they were shown pardons by the Chancellor (Kempe) and the Bishop of Winchester (Waynfleete). The Chronicle of William of Wyr cester (p. 76 et seq.) gives the correct detail of the negotiation with Cade in the church of St. Margaret Southwark, on the 6th July (the morning after the indecisive fight on London Bridge). Cade is designated John Mortimer in his pardon, which is dated on (Monday) the very day of the negotiations, as appears by the Patent Roll. On the same day are dated the pardons for John Robynson, William Bygge, Simon Morley, and John Swayn, of the city of Canterbury ; but the remainder of the pardons bear date the following day (Tuesday), 7th July. The number of names entered on the Patent Roll shows that accurate muster-rolls must have been kept ; and the appearance"], [50, "30 JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN KENT. of the same parish in different parts of the roll may indicate that the persons took part in the two different parts of the rising, for two parts there were. Kent had been discontented in the early part of the year 1450. Thomas Cheyney, a fuller, of Canterbury, \" calling himself an heremite cleped Blew-berd,\" had been taken on 9th February, at Canterbury, for raising a rebellion.1 He was executed, and his head ordered to be sent to that city ; but so great was his popu larity, that the sheriffs of London had much difficulty in convey ing it, \" as unneth any persones durst nor wolde take upon hem the caridge,\" 2 for doubt of their lives. The Duke of Suffolk was taken off Dover on 2nd May, and killed. Lord Say, who lived at Knole, was Lord Lieutenant ; his son-in-law, William Crowmer, was Sheriff, and the threats they held out against the \"Commons of Kent\" brought matters to a crisis. I give the several dates from the Chronicle of William of Wyrcester. Whitsunday was on 24th May, and in that week the insur rection of the commons of Kent alone began. On 1st June, the camp was fixed at Blackheath ; on Sunday, 7th, the King came to London, and on 11th set out against the rebels. But they had decamped in the night, and retired to Sevenoaks. They were followed by two Staffords, who, with twenty-fuur followers, were killed at Sevenoaks. The King then went to Kenilvvorth. At the end of the month, Cade and his followers were joined by strong contingents from Sussex and Surrey. They made a second march to Blackheath. On Friday, 3rd July, they entered London city, and were met by a good number from Essex. On 4th, James Fynes, Lord Say, was beheaded at the Standard' in Chepe and his son-in-law, Crowmer, without Aldgate. The citizens were pillaged, and on the night of Sunday, 5th July, they rose and fought Cade and his men on London Bridge. On the morning of the 6th began the negociations with Cade for \" a charter of pardon from the King/or them alls but as a preliminary, Cade insisted and obtained the acceptance by the Stowe's Annals, p. 388. \u25a0 Ellis' Letters, ser. 2, vol. i. p. 1 lo."], [51, "JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN KENT. 31 Chancellor and Bishop Waynfleet of the Bill of Petitions, which had been refused by the Privy Council. The complaints of the commons of Kent comprised fifteen heads ; they are printed at length in Stowe's Annals, p. 388, and the following are the par ticular grievances of the county :\u2014 \" 1. It is openly noysed that Kent should be destroyed with royall power, and made a wild forest, for the death of the Earl of Suffolke, of which the commons were never guilty.\" And, after complaining that the King lived on his commons, whilst his own revenues were held by other men ; that the lords of the royal blood had been put out of his presence,1 and other mean persons of lower nature exalted to be of his Privy Council ; that the stuff and purveyance for the King's household had not been paid for ; that people were impeached and indicted to have grants obtained of their land ; that divers poor people and commons of the realm, having perfect title to their land, had that title impeached and could not pursue their right ; that the King's lands in France had been alienated ; and requiring that the traitors who did it should be punished ; they say : \u2014 \"8. Collectors of the 15 peny in Kent be greatly vexed and hurt in paying great sums of money in the Exchequer to sue out a writ called Quorum nomina, for allowance of the Barons of the Ports, which now is desired that hereafter in the lieu of the collectors the Barons aforesaid may sue it out for their ease at their own costs.\"2 And then, having complained of the excessive surety or bail taken by the sheriffs ; and of feigned indictments against simple and poor people that use not hunting; and of the returns of amerciaments called \"the Green Waxe,\" without summons or warning; they proceed: \u2014 1 In his own requests Cade expressly names the exiled Duke of York. 2 This was a writ to prove the exemption of the Barons of the Cinque Ports resident within the county parishes from liability to contribute to the subsidies."], [52, "32 JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN KENT. \" 12.

On receiving pardons, the main body of the commons dis persed, but Cade alleged that the pardons were insufficient with out the sanction of Parliament (they are undoubtedly tested at Westminster, where the King was not), and persuaded a remnant of his followers to remain in arms. He retired with them to Rochester, having previously sent there the plate, jewels, and money which had been taken during the rising. They failed in an attack upon Queenborough castle, which was successfully defended by Sir Roger Chamberleyn1 and two men. Geoffry Kechyn and another, called \" Capitaignes Boucher,\" were taken ; and a third, William Parmenter, also calling himself \" a captain of Kent,\" with other principals, were placed in the custody of Thomas Waryn, and then sent to the castles of Windsor and Winchester.2 In the Act of attainder3 passed in the Parliament held at Westminster, on the 9th November following, Cade is described as having levied war subsequently to his pardon,* viz., at South wark, on the 8th July, at Deptford and Rochester, on the 9th, and also at Rochester and elsewhere, on the 10th and 11th July. The King's proclamation was issued on the 10th July; the assumed name of Mortimer used in the pardon of the 6th was dropped ; he was called John Cade, and a reward of 1000 marks 5 was offered for him ; and a further reward of 5 marks for any of those who should from that day forth accompany him. In fact, \" diso-uised in a strange attire, he privily fled into the wood country, beside Lewes in Sussex, hoping to escape.\" He was pursued by Alexander Iden, the new sheriff of Kent, and by \" others with him,\" and not alone.

One quarter was sent to Black heath ; a second to Norwich, where the Bishop (Walter Harp) was supposed to favour the cause of the Duke of York ; a third to Salisbury; and the fourth to Gloucester, the Abbot of St. Peter's there being also a favourer of the cause.4 Two followers of Cade were also beheaded: the quarters of one, Nicholas Jakes, were sent to Chichester, Rochester, Portsmouth, and Colchester ; and those of John Rammesey, wine drawer, to Stamford, Coven try, Newbury, and Winchester,6 showing how widely spread were the opinions of the \" commons of Kent.\" Iden is called \" our trusty and well beloved Alexandre Iden, Shirrief of our countie of Kent,\" and he also had 20 marks reward, for taking and conducting to the King Robert Spence, \" a sworn brother to the great traitor and rebel calling himself John Mortymer.\" The order of 15th July further charged the Treasurer and Chamberlains, if there were any person or persons from whom any of the said \" goodes, catelles, and juelx as above, by wey of spoiling or robbing, were taken from,\" and coming to them, 1 Page 68. \u25a0 Rymer, E\u0153dera, torn. xi. p. 275. 3 Iden was also rewarded by being made keeper of Rochester Castle, with a salary of 36Z. a-year, out of which he was to pay 16'. for repairs.

If Cade had been the low-born person he has been represented, no act of attainder would have been of any operation against his lands and tenements, nor would it have been of importance to declare his blood corrupt. He was supposed to be put forward by the Duke of York in order to ascertain the feeling of the nation towards his claims, and hence the assumed name of the Duke's cousin, Mortimer. The name of Cade, however, was not of unfrequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Heathfield. It is to be found in the subsidy rolls of Mayfield down to 1557. In the subsidy of 1328 we have John and William Le Cade, Robert and Matthew Cade ; in 1332 Richard Le Cade, and two Johns, Robert, William, and Matthew Cade ; in 1523 we find Ellen Cade, wid. ; in 1545 John Cade; in 1558-9 John Cade, with lands worth 41. a-year ; and in 1557, John Cade, with lands worth 40s.1 That the consequence of his acts, even after his death, con tinued to be thought of moment by the Council is evidenced by the fact that the act of 1450 was not deemed sufficient, and in the parliament holden at Reading, two years afterwards (1452 ),2 a further act of attainder was passed in which Cade is called the \" most abominable tyrant, horrible, odious, and errant false traitor, John Cade, calling and naming himself sometime Mor timer, and sometime Captain of Kent ; \" it is declared that he had taken upon himself royal power, and gathered to him the King's people in great number, \"by false subtil imagined language,\" and had \" seditiously made a stirring rebellion and insurrection under colour of justice, for the reformation of the laws of the King,\" robbing, slaying, and spoiling \"great part of his faithful people : \" and, thereupon, Cade was adjudged a traitor, and all indictments and acts done by him were declared void. Robert Poynings, who was uncle of the Countess of Northum berland, and had acted as Cade's \" Carver and Sewer,\" gave further evidence of the discontent.

He was also charged with having, on the 20th of January, caused Thomas Bigg, of Lambeth, \" yoman,\" outlawed of treason, and John Wildeley, of Southwark, and other riotous persons to have assembled at Westerham and caused a riot.

The part taken by Sussex men in the rising has been very slightly noticed by our historians. The chroniclers vary in their descriptions of Cade's followers : Holinshed says, as we have seen, that he drew to him from Kent \" a great company of tall per sonages;\"2 but he calls the others \"divers idle and vagrant persons out of the shire, Sussex, Surrie, and other places.\" 3 So far as Sussex, and especially East Sussex, was concerned, the rising partook, like Kent, very much of the character of a military and duly authorised levy and array. In many hundreds the musters were levied by the constables ; the small landowners (the yeomen), with their labourers, and some tradesmen, were ready in their appearance, and we have by name upwards of 400 Sussex men present. The state of Sussex was such that it might well cause discon tent. The Bishop (Adam Moleyns, who was murdered on the 9th January, 1450,) had been prominent among the King's very unpopular councillors; the French had landed with impunity, doing considerable damage ; and many complaints were current of the mode in which the fifteenths were collected.3 Lord Say and Sele (James Fiennes), the Lord Treasurer, was unfavour ably known in Sussex as having just acquired his title by grant, from John de Clinton, his Sussex kinsman; and it will be seen 1 The substance of this portion was also printed in vol. xviii. of the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological Collections. * The Essex and Suffolk men joined only when Cade was in the city. 3 The House of Commons had previously called the attention of the Govern- ment to the murders, rapes, robberies, and burnings that pervaded this county.

The Abbot of Battle (Richard Dertmouth), and the newly chosen Prior of Lewes (John Danyel), with their respective communities,1 sanctioned the movement, and were involved in the consequences; and their example was followed by the Bailiffs of Pevensey and Seaford, and the Constables of the Borough of Lewes, with the Burgesses of the same town. There joined him out of Sussex the Apsleys, Barttelots, Bartholomew Bolney, who had some ten years before acquired the manor of West Firle,2 the Burtons, Chaloners, Colbronds, Gilderidges,Laddes, Lunsfords, Melewards, Oxenbridges, Parkers, Robert Poynings, of Twineham and Sutton, who is described as having stirred the great part of such as were adherents, and accompanied Cade and was his carver and sword-bearer,3 the Selwins, Wolffes, and many others, who subsequently held office under or warmly supported Edward IV. The immediate provocation given to Kent by the harshness with which the men of that county were threatened in conse quence of the killing of the Duke of Suffolk, and by the oppres sions alleged against William Crowmer, then Sheriff, and Lord Say's son-in-law, did not apply to Sussex, and this county did not join till after the second advance towards London at the com mencement of July.4 Before noon on the Thursday, the day the Staffords were killed at Sevenoaks,5 the King and 20,000 armed men entered 1 So also did Katherine De la Pole, the Abbess of St. Mary, Barking, Essex.

The Lord Say and William Crowmer were arrested and committed to the Tower. Cade and his followers entered London. Wm. Wyrcester says a commission of Oyez and Terminer was then made, and Robert Danvers was made Justiciary.1 And the Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, the Bishop of Salisbury [i.e. Askewe, already dead], the Lord de Saye, Thomas Danyell, John Saye, and many others, were indicted of treason in the Guildhall of London ; and after this, on the 4th July next following, James Fynys Lord de Saye, in the 7th hour in the afternoon, was beheaded at the Standard in Chepe, and on the same day Wm. Crowmer, there tofore Sheriff of Kent, was beheaded by the said Captain without Aldgate, and a certain Thomas Bayly, Necromancer, or Diviner (nigromanticus vel geomanticus), at the White Chapel beyond the said Aldgate, was beheaded on the same day by the said Captain of Kent, which said Thomas had formerly been of the same way of thinking (cogitatione) with the same captain and of the like art2 (et una arte) ; and on the Sunday following [5th July] William Hawerdene, a chief counsellor of the captain and a common thief, was hung by the Captain's order at Smithfield ; and on the same night the Citizens, out of fear of the robbery of their goods, after a lengthened fight on London Bridge against the Captain and his people (gentes) of Kent, drove them into Southwark;3 many however were killed on both sides, and amongst others there was unfortunately slain Matthew Gouche, an old captain and very noted in the King's wars.4 And in like manner was there slain John Sutton, then an Alderman of the city.5 1 He had been elected Recorder 14th July, 1442, and on 14th Aug. of the year 1450 he was made a Judge of the Common Pleas by Henry IV., so that his con duct as Justiciary had pleased the King's Commissioners. 2 Took art and part. 3 At 9 a.m. the Londoners, says Holinshed, had been driven back to St. Magnus church. 4 He had been a distinguished soldier in France. 5 The late Mr. G. R. Corner, F.S.A., in the Surrey Arch. Coll., vol. ii. p. 66, following many histories, has erroneously dated the battle of the Bridge as 8th July. See the Paston Letters, vol. i. p. 57, for an amusing account by Payne, a servant of Sir John Falstolf, who had been taken by the rebels, and was present for six hours at this \" battle of the Bridge.\" L"], [94, "JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN SUSSEX. 74 On the morrow of the 6th July, (after the Bishop of Winchester (William Waynflete) and others of the King's Council had held conference with the said Captain of Kent in the church of St. Margaret of Southwark,1 and there received the bills of petitions; and in like manner had considered of a charter of pardon) the Captain and his commons retired to Rochester; and after this Alexander Iden was made Sheriff. It is more probable, that, instead of the Chancellor2 (John Kempe, Cardinal Archbishop of York ), and the Bishop of Win chester (Waynflete) passing from the Tower, \" bringing with them under the King's Great Seal a general pardon unto all the offenders,\" and causing the same to be openly published, and the poor men being \" so glad of this pardon that without bidding farewell to their Captain they withdrew themselves the same night,\" Kempe, who was a man of Kent, and had for a short time held the see of Chichester, and whose mother was a Sussex Lady (Lewknor),3 and Bishop Waynflete (his brother John was afterwards Dean of Chichester), were most anxious to restore peace and to induce Cade and his followers, many of whom must have been personally well known to the Cardinal, to accept pardons. Cade's own pardon recites that a certain John Mortimer, to gether with several others, in no small but to a large and great number, in many and divers places within the realm, and espe cially in the county of Kent and places adjoining and convenient, without the King's mandate or authority, but of their own accord, lately assembled themselves and were led against the King contrary to law, &c, and then the pardon is to the said John and all others who had so associated and conoreaated. The next entry on the roll is of pardons, not dated, for Wm. Tyrell, jr. esq., Matthew Hay, esq., John Batell, esq., Richard 1 At the dissolution of monasteries St. Margaret's and St. Mary's were united into St. Saviour's. Q Kempe, aud not the Archbishop of Canterbury, was then Chancellor. 3 The Lewknors remained staunch in their loyalty to Henry. The Cardinal's maternal grandmother was the heiress of the Dalingrudges ; and so he was not \" unconnected with any noble or influential family.\" Besides, the brother of his paternal grandfather had married a Neville of Raby,"], [95, "JOHN CADE'S FOLLOWERS IN SUSSEX. 75 Shodewell, gentilman, Roger Wyke, of Colchester, and Richard Stace, sen., for treason at several places in Essex, Middlesex, and London; then, dated the same 6th July, are pardons for the three citizens of Canterbury. On the following day pardons for the other followers by name were sealed; and whereas Cade's was directed to \"all Bailiffs,\" these were directed to the respective counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Essex, and Suffolk. There is the name of one person of Devonshire, and one of the city of Oxford ; one also, John Hereford, is described as an Irish man; he is called late of Kilkenny, yoman, but is in the same pardon with two other Herefords, one of London and the other of Bristol, so he was doubtless an Englishman, and the Irishmen were not involved in this rising, though the Duke of York was then in that country, and in the King's proclamation Cade is said to have been \"born in Ireland.\" The list of the Sussex men whose names are set out in the pardons is as follows,1 and it is only necessary to note the grades of those who were involved.

From another Inquisition post mortem taken at Stratford Langthorn, in the county of Essex, on Thursday next after the feast of All Saints, a.d. 1478, 18 Edw.

Sir Ralph died seized of the said lands by virtue of this demise, and his wife Elizabeth survived him1 and was solely seized of the same ; and the said manor was valued at 20 marks per annum beyond all reprisals, and the lands at 40 shillings per annum. This Inquisition also sets forth that Sir Ralph died without heirs of his body, and that George Jocelyn, his nephew, was found to be his next heir.2 It is evident from the information afforded by these inquisitions that the family of Earl Roden does not descend from Sir Ralph Jocelyn. It is also evident that he did not die intestate ; but, although a careful search has been made for his will, it has been without success.

LORD BACON. He was understood by some. Ben Jonson, after the author's death, described the book in terms of the highest praise : \" Though by most of superficial men, who cannot get beyond the title of nominals, it is not penetrated nor understood, it really openeth all defects of learning whatsoever. My conceit of his person was never increased towards him by his place or honours. But I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper in himself, and in that he seemed to me ever by his work one of the greatest men and most worthy of admiration that had been in many ages.\" The King, although he had expressed what doubtless he felt, the difficulty of understanding the work, wrote to Bacon, stating that he agreed with him in many of his remarks, and assured him that he could not have \" made choice of a subject more befitting his place and his universal and methodical knowledge.\" Sir Henry Wotton, on receiving three copies, expressed himself thus : \u2014 \" Your lordship hath done a great and everliving benefit to all the children of nature, and to nature herself in her upper most extent of latitude, who never before had so noble nor so true an interpreter, never so inward a secretary of her cabinet.\" On the continent the work was more highly honoured than at home, being esteemed by many of the most competent judges as one of the most important accessions ever made to philosophy. \u2014 Engl.

Sir Anthony Cooke was born at Gidea Hall, in Essex. He was a man eminent in all the circles of the arts, preferring contemplation to active life, and skilled in education. \" Contemplation,\" says Lloyd, \"was his soul, privacy his life, and discourse his element. Business was his purgatory, and publicity his torment. He took more pleasure"], [117, "95 APPENDIX. to breed up statesmen than to be one. He managed his family and children with such prudence and discretion, that Lord Seymour, stand ing by one day when this gentleman chid his son, said ' Some men govern families with more skill than others do kingdoms,' and thereupon com mended him to the government of his nephew, Edward VI. Such the majestie of his looks and gate, that awe governed; such the reason and sweetness, that love obliged all his family \u2014 a family equally afraid to displease so good a bead, and to offend so great. In their marriage they were guided by his reason, more than by his will ; and rather directed by his counsel, than led by his authority.\" He had five daughters, whose education he superintended ; and, thinking that women are as capable of learning as men, he instilled that to his daughters at night, what he had taught the Prince in the day ; and all the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke were perfectly skilled in the learned languages, which is apparent from his bequest of Latin and Greek books to each of them. They married suitably to the education with which they had been formed. MILDRED COOKE, LADY BURGHLEY.

Written at Collings Lodge by me in sorrow. W. B.\" LADY BACON. Anna, the second daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, was born in 1528. She had the same liberal education which was bestowed upon hei elder sister, and perhaps under the same tutor. Having added much acquired knowledge to great natural endowments, she made an illus trious figure among the literati of that period ; and hence acquired so extraordinary a reputation, that she is said to have been constituted governess to King Edward the Sixth. If this be a fact, it is a verv surprising one, since she could not be much more than twenty-five years of age at the death of that young monarch, and only nineteen years old when he began to reign. However that matter may stand, it is certain that she early became eminent for piety, virtue, and learn ing, and that she was skilled in the Greek, Latin, and Italian tongues. At what time she was married to Sir Nicholas Bacon has not been exactly ascertained. Her eldest son Anthony was born in 1558, and her youngest son Francis on the 22nd of January, 1560-61. \u2014 Biogr. Brit/an. vol. iv. pp. 96-97. Elizabeth Cooke, third daughter of Sir Anthony, born 1529, married, first, Sir Thomas Hoby. He was Ambassador to France of Queen Elizabeth: by him she had two sons and two daughters. The sons gave her uneasiness. She married, secondly, John Lord Russell, and their daughter Ann became the mother of the celebrated Marquis of Worcester, the author of A Century of Inventions, in which the steam-engine is first described. He was the father of the first Duke of Beaufort. 0"], [122, "98 APPENDIX. Katherine Cooke, fourth daughter of Sir Anthony, born in 1530, married Sir Henry Killigrew at St. Peter-le-Poer, London. She was buried in the church of St. Thomas Apostle, Vintry Ward, London. Her second daughter, Elizabeth, married Sir Jonathan Trelawny, and was the ancestress of the Bishop of that name, one of the Seven Bishops who opposed James the Second. \" And shall Trelawny die brave boys, and shall Trelawny die ? There's thirty thousand Cornishmen will know the reason why. Margaret Cooke, the second wife of Sir Ralph Rowlett, died 1571, s. p., during her father's life. She was buried at St. Mary Staining, London.

LORD BACON. \" There happened in my time one noble speaker who was full of quantity in his speaking: his language, where he could spare or pass by a jest, was richly censorious. No man ever spake more greatly, more purely, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness in what he uttered ; no member of his speech but what consisted of its own graces. His hearers could not cough, or look aside from him, without loss ; he commanded when he spake, and had his judges angry and pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections more on his person ; the fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end.\" \u2014 Ben Jonson."], [123, "APPENDIX. 99 MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. \" He has proved himself in the Commons an orator, an adminis trator, and it may be added, a thinker of the first class ; and whereas others give promise at their first entrance into public life, too often falsified in later years, Lord Salisbury has developed a higher character by experience and familiarity with the problems of statesmanship.
