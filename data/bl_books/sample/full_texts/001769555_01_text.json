From a copy owned by the writer. In illustrating this volume the writer has continued a practice adopted by him for sev eral other books that he has published or privately printed. He has examined all that he could find (in some cases a large number) of the plates relating to the subject treated, and from them has reproduced what is best, or practicable, having some regard to age or rar ity, more to excellence or interest, and most to accuracy. Of the illustrations here (28 full pages), 12 have been made for the work, 19 are from pen-and-ink drawings, 5 are from old and scarce plates, 2 from newer but not common, 1 is from Record, and 1 from a title very rare in such fine condition. Nearly all the originals are in the writer's col lection; but the Record (27) belongs to the First Church, the plate of the Town Hall (14) to the Bostonian Society (both copied by permission), one (16) belongs to the Charlestown Public Library, and one (17) is used by the courtesy of Mr. Edes. Five subjects are for accuracy based on photographed lines, and seven pages are from drawings by the writer (12, 19, 20, 22-25). At first he thought of reproducing a considerable number of wood cuts, made in the course of the past fifty years, as the only existing representations of buildings destroyed or altered ; but as some of the cuts are rudely engraved, and most of them are inaccurate, they are omitted. Everything given here (except curiosities, 2 to 5) can be relied on, even the view in 1848 (12), which, though it has little art, shows verv closely the forms and positions of meeting-houses and prominent buildings as they then were. Views of Bunker Hill Monument are so numerous and good that none seem to be needed here.

' I \"HIS book contains, first, a history of Charlestown, Massa- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 chusetts, from its destruction in 1775 a to the present time, in which the characteristics of growth or action \u2014 about all for which this busy world has time \u2014 are shown unincum bered by a great deal of detail. Next, there is a sketch, very hard to make, of the original town in 1638, and then, with more minuteness, a survey of the town burned, and of build ings at that time and since on the ground, together with notices of occupants, \u2014 showing how the writer was obliged to work lot by lot through hundreds of estates and diversi fied or complex accounts in order to make a simple statement of the limits of the fire and the nature and position of the losses. Following this are records, entire, and not extracts, important and hitherto unprinted, in regard to a great num ber of the inhabitants from 1775 to 1832, continuing records (1632-1789) that he has already made public. Lastly, there is an addition to his Bibliography of the place (1880) with fresh matter, a list of native or resident authors, and another of all the books (107) and pamphlets (100) that he has yet 1 The history of the town before its destruction, as is well known, has been written, and by two authors who were ideals of what was desirable for their work. The Rev. Dr. Budington (pp. 39, 54) gave us the religious part, while the civil was presented by the Hon. Richard Frothingham, who was by family connected with the town from its settlement, and was for a long time active in its affairs. Both of them were fully acquainted and identified with it, and were widely known ; and the writer, as well as others, whose friends they had been from boyhood, felt a sad loss when they passed away. Of the large territory formerly in Charlestown, but now Somerville, but little of the history is given in this book, as it is already prepared by another writer."], [20, "PREFACE. X found printed in the town through fifty years after the press was established there (1786-1836). To all this various mat ter he has made an index referring to some 5,000 names, where in mentioning families with many persons he has ex tended the division to their first initial. Charlestown is perhaps a unique place in the country. While it has a history from 1629, at least, it was wholly re built, except in its outer or inland parts, since the Declara tion of Independence, and has since, by an annexation, ceased to be individual, and has, in one way, become that American rarity, a completed municipality. Hence it is, certainly to some extent, a representative of what that important member of the body politic, an American town, might or would be, when, also in a way, beginning and ending under the influ ence of a century of the national life. The writer's authorities are records, deeds, plans, private statements, the nearest complete collection of books and pamphlets about the place, and his own observation or long acquaintance. He has lived in the town and has known many of the people there through its course of change from mod erate size and municipal individuality to doubled population and subordinate position as a part of a great city, and has seen many of the old, sometimes once large, families passing away. It is with interest in the familiar scenes and people that he writes their story, with an endeavor to be correct and just, to describe things as they have been or are, and to keep within limits that should protect what is private, in the last particular feeling, perhaps, more at liberty with his own than he would with what pertains to others. No one can write such a story without here or there some slip ; but in only one book does a single error make a wicked Bible, and in all human books, and even in some criticisms on them, there will be errors about facts, as well as opinions on which there are disagreements. Sufficient care and labor have been spent by the writer to make him feel that confidence can be safely put in the present work. In one part, however, he is obliged to feel doubts, that is in regard to the Plan, 1638. It is an approximate one, \u2014 all that ever can be made, \u2014 for the early"], [21, "PREFACE. XI descriptions and deeds are so vague or imperfect that nobody can now safely be positive, or be accurate except in a few particulars. Another exception must also, and partly for like reasons, be added in regard to the Survey, 1775 ; for while the writer feels sure about a large number of the many estates, about some he is in doubt, and generally has said so on the spot. Only one who has attempted to reconstruct from scat tered materials a town burned over a hundred years ago can realize the difficulty of the work. The writer has, however, gained the end he proposed, that of learning closely the extent and nature of the town destroyed. \u25a0 In regard to any exact legal case about an old estate, the course to be taken is told on page 110 ; it is such as a business man would follow, for in such a case there is little in type on which he would rely. It is easy, in one sense, to write about the place where one was born, and has lived, and known many people, and when memory and observation, or print and writing make one feel sure about a great deal. Yet in another sense it is hard to describe events and objects without offence or without a cer tain exaggeration or vagueness apt to appear in local books, \u2014 to be obliged to compress, and to omit much, and yet to tell what the results, and monuments, so to speak, really are, so that some correct idea may be had of them ; to look at them, indeed, as from the outside, as the world might, and not through the confined range of a merely local vision. Not only is it desirable, but in varying degrees it is impor tant, that certain materials, or results of observations should be preserved, and those who can furnish them should at least try to do their part. Hence the writer feels that there is not only a reason for the present book on his native town, but that it properly accompanies other works on distant subjects that he has published. His first attempt at recording his observations was in what might be called only regions of ro mance, but they included a great deal of real nature along with matter-of-fact antiquities, topography, and history, all made charming by the creations, as well as the genial char acter and beneficent life of one of the world's great men of genius. \" The Lands of Scott \" was the result."], [22, "XII PREFACE. Enlarging, or changing, a systematic observation from a personal or romantic subject \u2014 important nevertheless \u2014 to the history of a people, the writer was led to examine the objects that form their most expressive records, \u2014 the re ligious, civil, military, and domestic works that embody the thought and spirit of the ages. These, far more than some persons even dream, are of extreme value, for they show the very essence, and most vivid and truthful expression, of his tory. Yet precious as they are, many persons to whom they relate will take little care to save them. Our own country has not been excessively attentive to our scanty possessions. In another country the writer had seen the results of syste matic efforts to preserve a great number of objects, some of them very large, making an admirable history of a nation through nearly sixty generations. His \"Historical Monu ments of France,\" with extensive details and fuller descrip tions of representative works, shows how her Commission for their preservation, already fifty years old, has, notwithstand ing all mistakes, done noble service, and proved a model for England and America. To those who speak the English tongue, and who are now spread throughout the world, the historic structures of the home-land are of even more interest. After many visits to a great number of these, the writer in a compact yet comprehen sive way, showed their position both geographically and in the history of England from an obscure wilderness to world wide rule. His \"Imperial Island\" (Boston), or \"England's Chronicle in Stone\" (London) not only shows this, but also may fairly stand as a trustworthy account of their condition and chief features, described from his own notes on the spot as they are to a great extent. As such an account of their subjects the three books will stand, and to them, based also on personal observation and helped by much illustrative ma terial, is added the present volume. On Charlestown ground there are few historic stones to save other than those in the old burial-ground. There are a few buildings and paintings, two or three public statues, and one great monument to be kept as long as possible. Our"], [23, "PREFACE. XIII maternal political ancestor left us few old things to care for, except records that she was not allowed to handle. Yet in regard to her we can feel that former trials are past, that our ends were secured, and that, in a friendly spirit, we should now not dwell on the past, but recognize her immense value in the present and future of the world's civilization. With a desire to tell the story of the Bunker Hill town since it arose a real Ph\u0153nix, and to help preserve what might be lost, the writer presents this book. If his words here prove, as they may, his final words about the old familiar place, they end with kind remembrance of it, and with the best of wishes for Charlestown. Note. \u2014 The printing of this book was begun June 21, 1887, at page 109, and was continued to page 300. Page 1 was begun Sep. 20. Meanwhile subjects for some addi tional statements have appeared. In regard to Bunker Hill, Lieut.-Col. H. N. Fisher has made and exhibited to the Bostonian Society (Oct. 11) a large and notable map of the town and the Battle, \u2014 an important addition to the topographical and military literature of the place and event. An immense panorama of the same subject has been painted, and will be exhibited. Of detailed claims for losses in the town, June 17, 1775, the writer has seen (Jan. 26) that of Thad. Mason (see p. 131), the only one not examined when the survey (pp. 112 56) was prepared. Mr. Mason had, painted throughout, a three-storied house, with a new porch (papered), and\" six rooms and the staircase handsomely papered; \" also a new barn, chaise-house (28 x 16), woodhouse (26 X 14), hogsty, henhouse, two sheds, etc., and a \"Summer House on the Bank handsomly finished, papered & painted, with a Cellar under it; \" also in a garden about \"30 fine thrifty fruit Trees as Cherries, Pears, Plumbs, Quinces, &c, & Currents en? to make 40 or 50 Gallons of Wine yearly.\" Be sides furniture, etc., he lost \" 2 large painted Family Peices carv'd gilt Frames \u00a34. 16. ; 10 metzinto Pictures, under Glass, gilt edg'd Frames a 5. 4 each \u2014 \u00a35.6.8,\" and \"28 Pictures painted on Glass gilt Frames a 3. each \u2014 \u00a34. 4.\" He also lost about 65 books (titles all given, 11 of them folios), but including scarcely anything of what is called Americana; but there were also \"ab'. 200 Pamplets, as serm** &c. great Part of 'em val uable a 4d each,\" and \"News Papers for 40 years past\" (not valued). His total esti mate for his books aud pamphlets was \u00a310. 14. 8. (See pp. 14 and 98-100.) The praiseworthy desire to make known interesting historic spots has led to the prep aration, under the lead of Wm. Murray, of a tablet with an inscription that tells its own valued story: \"Here was born | SAMUEL FINI.EY BREESE MORSE | 27 April 1791 | Investor of the | Electric Telegraph.\" The stone is to be on the front of his birthplace (see p. 149). There, says Dr. Prime, Dr. and Mrs. Morse \"began house keeping, shortly\" after their marriage, \"in a hired house on Main Street.\" In a work about the town the honors conferred on its distinguished native should be named.

To the Bibliography should be added the very interesting list of books given to Har vard College, in 1638, by its founder, and printed in the \"Bibliographical Contributions,\" edited by Justin Winsor (No. 27, 1888). \"There were evidently over 300\" volumes. Of the titles, sixty-five per cent are Latin, and all are much abbreviated in the list, which is headed : \" Cataloyus librorum quos dedit dominus Hervertus [ffarvardus] Colleyii hujus patronus.\" Also, at the last moment, has appeared a work on one of the old and well-known fami lies : \"Memorial of James Thompson, of Charlestown, Mass., 1630-42, and Woburn,Mass., 1642-1682 ; and of Eight Generations of His Descendants.

' I \"HE first lessons in local history that the writer had were \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 in his father's house, at what were called old ladies' par ties, when several relatives, who were girls \u2014 one of them nine teen years old \u2014 when the town was burned, used to spend the day with his grandmother. They had been intimate through long lives, and many a story of their early days they told. Memory brings back clearly that pleasant group, as they sat in their black dresses and quaint white caps, chatting, and now and then having their odd little laugh that in a sunshiny way lighted up their then wrinkled faces. Not a word of unkindly gossip was heard, but they talked of things long past that they still well remembered, of the alarm when the British came back from Lexington, how women and children were rowed over Medford river, and how the red-coats looked in Main Street. What the old ladies said was undoubtedly quite as true as a good deal that we call history, and it was certainly much more interesting, \u2014 especially than some of the matter we compose from dry bits of record. They knew all the people, too, and could make them seem living if they were not. Their talk of them was far different from the poor little string of items and dates, some dubious, that forms what is called a genealogy. To the writer they then seemed of age beyond counting, and it was strange and entertaining that they could discourse in such ancient lore. But alas ! there was no short-hand writing, or any note-taking; like their good selves, and the times and people they talked about, the most that they said has vanished, and they seem to flit by the desk where these lines are written, l"], [26, "2 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. and mingle with shadowy scores and hundreds who in years past have been guests in the old house, and fill it with associ ations to be cherished in silence. Still, the writer's observation supplies much, and there is a good deal to be gleaned from written or printed statements or records, that, when sifted, and facts are used, and safe deduc tions made, will help to a pretty full and true story. It is in teresting to look at this material, to find what it amounts to, and, so far as we can, what the old town was just before and after the great fire in 1775, and then watch the growth to the present time. To do this, we had best at first look at the be ginning of the town, and then take a somewhat careful survey of what there is about the ending of Provincial Charlestown. THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. In trying to get some clear idea of the town burned by the British, June 17, 1775, \u2014 the first great material sacrifice of our countrymen in the war for our national independence, \u2014 the writer was at the outset led to find out what was the original village from which it grew, and thus to make a plan of it, -\u2014 now the oldest part of the chief city of New England. In these two respects a survey of Charlestown has, as properly belongs to it, much more than a local interest. The colonists under the Massachusetts Company were to be established on its territory. The place for the capital was chosen ; pioneers came to make ready for a large number of settlers ; and thus Charlestown was founded in 1629, and in July, 1630, many hundreds of English \u2014 men, women, and chil dren, \u2014 were trying to live in huts and tents on or around the Town Hill, at the foot of which was the Great House, shelter ing the Governor and his chief associates. Changes in plans followed. A large part of the people went to Boston, and a small population remained. Who were the persons, and where they were in 1638, is told us, although in a puzzling way, that the writer has tried to make clear by fitting the parts of a very disjointed account on a map he has drawn for his own help, and has put, with explanations, in this book (p. 109), where it may"], [27, ""], [28, "I View f>//y//r ATTACK^/ BTJlfKER'sHILL./'/v/'/ //fc y"], [29, "3 THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. be of other service. So vague are the early descriptions, and so imperfect the deeds remaining, that no human being can make the old lines exact, nor can even opinions always agree. When we try to understand clearly what the town was on the morning of that memorable day in June, 1775, we find that there is a much greater puzzle before us than we would have thought before we tried. Every one who knew about it died long ago, and what is left us in black and white on paper is slight, indefinite, or mixed, and requires sorting. Views printed or drawn, we might suppose would help us. If we look at those either of the town or the battle made near the time, we find them, nearly all, like those made by hundreds in England during the last century. They show certain feat ures, but in a vague way, with slight regard to perspective or accuracy. An exceptionally good view \u2014 and it is good \u2014 is a sketch reproduced in the \" Memorial History of Boston \" (Vol. HI.), but the scale is so small that we learn little from it about details of the town. An extraordinary view of the battle, in Cookings' \" American War \" (1781), re-engraved in much larger size in Barnard's \"History of England\" (1783), and the plate by Romans (Penn. Mag.), show a town; but one as unlike Charlestown as it well could be. Indeed, of these, as of the few other views, we may say that we are glad we have even them, but that they are curiosities, now rare, rather than representations. In another art, also sometimes vividly graphic, yet often, as are these views, very imaginative, we find no more help, and as much to mislead. The poetry of the age reveals either little, or such a passage as this in \"An Eulogium on Maj: Gen. Warren (1781) by a Columbian \" (p. 18). \"Amazing scene ! what shudd'ring prospects rise ! What horrors glare beneath the angry skies ! The rapid flames o'er Charlestown's heights ascend, To heaven they reach ! urg'd by the boist'rous wind. The mournful crash of falling domes resound, And tott'ring spires with sparkles seek the ground. One gen'ral burst of ruin reigns o'er all, The burning city thunders to its fall ! . . . Beneath prodigious unextinguished fires, Ill-fated Charlestown welters and expires.\""], [30, "4 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. In the drama of \" The Battle of Bunker' s-Hill \" (by H. H. Brackenridge, 1776), we find only this allusion to the confla gration (act v., sc. x.) : \u2014 \"A town on fire, and rushing from its base, With ruin hideous, and combustion down.\" John Burk's \"Bunker Hill, a Tragedy\" (1797), omits the episode, and \" The Fall of British Tyranny ... a Tragi-comedy of Five Acts\" (Phila., 1776) refers to it in prose (act hi., sc. vii.), but shows only some of the popular feeling aroused, in the comments of a \" Neighbour. A terrible black day it was, and ever will be remembered by New England, when that vile Briton (unworthy the name of a Briton), Lord Boston [Gen. Gage] , (curse the name !) . . . a fratricide ! 't was he who fir'd Charlestown, and spread desolation, fire, flames and smoke in ev'ry corner; he was the wretch, \u2014 that waster of the world, that licens'd robber,\" etc. In \"America Invincible\" (Danvers, 1779), we find also only a reference, but with it an assertion of the effect of the fire on the provincial forces. \"Not Charlestown's flame that spiring high arose ; Nor all the smoke that aided to oppose ; Could shake the firmness of Columbia's Band, To yield submissive the adjacent land.\" Rev. Robert Colvill, in his \"Poetical Works\" (London, 1789), speaks of brave gentlemen who died on \" the field of battle, before the walls of Charlestown,\" and Cockings, in the \"American War\" (London, 1781), stating that his \"design has been to relate authenticated facts,\" writes in this way (p. 17):- \" From house to house the conflagration spread ; Ear-piercing shrieks ; heart-rending groans, and cries ; And terrifying shouts of vict'ry rise : Amidst the desolating wild uproar, Forth rushed th' inhabitants from ev'ry door, To sex, nor age, no place an azyle yields ; In crowds they ran, and sought th' adjacent fields ; Swifter than they, the rapid bullets flew, And some ill-fated persons overthrew.\""], [31, "THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. 5 As to the \" crowds,\" Dr. Stiles (quoted by Mr. Frothingham in his \" Siege,\" p. 202) wrote that \" the body of the people were gone,\" except \" one hundred or two hundred, or more, men and women,\" when the battle had really begun, and Rev. John Martin (of R. I.), who for needed rest and refreshment made a brief visit to \" Mr. Cary and son, still in their own house, . . . when a ball came through \" it, says that he left for the Hill, and \" then the town evacuated with all haste,\" \u2014 a movement about which the poet has used some license. At present, newspapers would contain rousing and detailed accounts of the fire, under a startling array of head-lines in assorted type. If we turn to the \" Essex Gazette \" (then at Cambridge), a leading paper, a weekly, we find in No. 360, June 22, on the last page, without the distinctions of large letters or even of italics used in the advertisements around it, an account of the battle, written very temperately until this mention is made of the fire : \u2014 \" The Town of Charlestown, supposed to contain about 300 Dwelling-Houses, a great Number of which were large and ele gant, besides 150 or 200 other Buildings, are almost all laid in Ashes by the Barbarity and wanton Cruelty of that infernal Villain, Thomas Gage.\" Without the slightest break by reglet or leading, the article ends with a notice of a marriage on \" the 6th Instant.\" This, the whole account (imperfectly reproduced in Hist. Mag., June, 1868, p. 375), is even more particular than the accounts in other papers at the time, and a notable example of the meagre information, or news, then supplied by the Amer ican press. In the \" Massachusetts Spy \" (Worcester, June 21) is the mere mention that during the attacks on the Hill the town \" appeared in flames in almost every quarter, supposed to be kindled by hot balls.\" The short account of the battle from which this extract is made is without specially distinctive head-lines, but it is printed in italics. In the \" Boston Gazette\" (Watertown, June 19) there is also only a brief mention of the fire, and other newspapers of the time elsewhere give little or nothing. Indeed, nowhere does there seem to be anything more than a general statement about the town, without details, affording no clear idea of its exact nature and aspect."], [32, "6 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. In regard to the time when the fire occurred, and the way it was started, we are favored with not a few of the variegated statements out of which history often must be shaped. Along with them we are also told about the time when the battle was fought, all of which particulars may well be added in a note. Note. \u2014 The hours here refer to the movements of the British troops. 8 A. m., says a \"gentleman in Providence\" (June 20), they landed, \" and fired the town in divers places.\" 10 a. m., says Capt. Hide (\" N. Y. Gazette,\" June 26), they \" marched out of Boston, landed in Charles-Town, and plundering it of all its valuable effects, set fire to it in ten different places at once; then\" began the battle. About noon, says the \" Boston Gazette \" (June 19), they crossed. After the retreat of the Provincials, they set fire to the town, \"beginning with the Meeting-House.\" Between 12 and 1, says the Rev. Peter Thacher, an eye-witness from the north side of Mystic River, they were crossing. At the \"instant \" they began to move on the works, the town was seen to be on fire, set from some of the British \"batterys.\" This account is followed in the state ment by the Committee of Safety, Provincial Congress (July 25). 1 p. m., says the \" Essex Gazette \" (June 22), they were crossing, and before their attack \" set fire to the town.\" About 1 p. M. , says Sam1. Paine (June 22), they embarked, and, at near the time of landing, \"the Ships threw Carcasses into [the town], and in a few minutes the whole [of it] was in flames.\" Meanwhile the attack began. In a letter based on letters from the camp (Force IV., Hist. Mag., 375) it is stated that about 1 a. m. [p. m.] it was learned at Cambridge that the Regulars were landing, but before help could reach the works \"the battle had begun in earnest;\" also that the British troops set the town \" on fire with torches.\" About 1, says the Rev. Andrew Elliot, of Boston, the troops started from there; about 3 the battle began, and lasted perhaps an hour; and \"amidst the carnage \" the town was set on fire. About 2 the Br. troops embarked (\" N. Y. Gazetteer,\" July 13) ; a large body suddenly crossed to C. (Prov. Congress, June 28, to Com. at Albany) ; they began to land (\"Mass. Spy,\" June 21; Mass, to Cont. Congress; Col. Prescott, Aug. 25) ; 2,000'landed (Wm. Tudor, June 23) ; they landed (Capt. J. Chester, July 22) ; a large army landed (I. Lothrop, June 22) ; about 2 they began to land (Mass. Prov. Congress to Cont. Cong., June 20), and at 5 \" were in full possession of all the posts within the [isthmus].\" 2 p. m., wrote Pres't Stiles, the attack was begun, and continued about four hours until nearly night ; elsewhere also writing that the battle lasted three or four hours to between 5 and 6, the hottest part being from 3 to 4i. As to the duration of the battle, it \"lasted 35 minutes with the mus-"], [33, "THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. 7 quetry\" (says Capt. Chester, informed by a spectator \"on Chelsea side \") ; it \" lasted perhaps an hour \" (says the Rev. A. Elliot in Boston, June 19); about four hours (says Dr. Stiles, Newport). As to the end, the Provincials retreated about 5 o'clock (says S. Gray, Roxbury, July 12) ; \"about sunset\" (\"Boston Gazette,\" Juue 19); and the British held all the [peninsula] at 5 (Prov. Congress, June 20). Additional statements about the fire are found in several accounts. The \" N. Y. Gazetteer \" (July 13) from the Mass. Occasional Newspaper, states that the town \" was set on fire during the engagement and most part of it consumed,\" (thus confirming the Rev. A. Elliot, Mass, to Cont. Congress, \" Mass. Spy,\" I. Lothrop, and S. Gray, already mentioned). That the fire was set before, or at the beginning of, the attack, is stated by the \"Essex Gazette,\" Capt. Hide, the Rev. P. Thacher, the Com. of Safety, Pres't Stiles, and Gen. Dearborn. That it was set after the battle is stated by the \"Boston Gazette,\" and Wm. Tudor, who says, \"After they [the Regulars] had forc'd the Provincials from the Hill, they fir'd the Town, which after burning two Days, exhibit'd a scene of Ruin unparalell'd be fore in America.\" In regard to the extent of the fire, we have a similar assort ment of statements. The \" Boston Gazette \" says that it began \" with the Meeting-House, and we hear they have not left one Building unconsumed.\" The same beginning is stated by S. Gray. \"Charlestown is intirely burn't down\" (adds Wm. Tudor, June 23). It \" is now consumed to a wretched heap of rubbish\" (adds I. Lothrop). We farther learn that the town, \" consisting of near 500 houses and other buildings, was, by these bloody incendiaries set on fire and consumed to ashes \" (Prov. Cong, to Com. at Albany) ; and that there \" were three hundred Houses, all of which but perhaps two or three were reduced to Ashes & Ruins \" (Stiles's Diary). \" Strait before us,\" says Gen. Burgoyne (June 25), was \"a large & noble Town in one great Blaze ; the Chh. Steeples being of Timber, were great Pyramids of Fire above the rest.\" To Great Britain the Provincial Congress stated (July 25) that \" the Town of Charlestown, the buildings of which were in general large and elegant, and which contained effects belonging to the unhappy sufferers in Boston to a very great amount, was entirely de stroyed ; and its chimneys and cellars now present a prospect to the Americans exciting indignation,\" etc. Gen. Gage, who probably knew as much as any one about the events, wrote"], [34, "8 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. (June 26) that the town \" was set on fire during the engage ment and most part of it consumed.\" Gen. Dearborn added (1818) that \" a very few houses escaped.\" From these statements, such as they are, it is easier to de termine the course of events than the nature and extent of the town ; yet by a good deal of patience with materials that are described on pages 112, 113, the latter becomes clear, and the complete story can be briefly told. The American forces were entrenched on the hill by the monument, or variously posted along the fields to the river northward, or on the higher hill towards the Neck. The town was abandoned by the inhabitants, yet some buildings seem to have been used as covers by shooters more or less sharp. These latter fired on British troops, who, about 2 o'clock, landed along the shore at what is now the easterly part of the sea-front of the Navy Yard, or later began the battle. General Gage had repeatedly told the people of the town that he would burn it if they allowed it to be used as a base for hos tilities against his forces (Frothingham's \" Siege,\" 201), and he kept his word. There were reports that his troops were galled by firing thence, and the rebels audaciously stood on Bunker Hill. Accordingly shells were thrown towards the Square (do., 143) from a battery on Copp's Hill (Letter, June 25), and men from the \" Somerset \" frigate landed eastward, so that be tween them all the town was soon, at various points, thoroughly in flames. The meeting-house was a conspicuous mark, and the conflagration may have begun there. It is, however, stated (1882) that buildings of Dea. Townsend, \" near the foot of Chestnut Street and at the head of Maudlin's shipyard,\" were the first kindled. As to the nature and extent of the town thus set on fire, a clear idea can only be gained after laborious references to hun dreds of details in several authorities described on pages 112, 113, and in what proves to be a very long note (pp. 114-155) where the writer shows how he has come to conclusions about what the people left behind and the British destroyed. By that time the village had grown a great deal since 1638, but more in population and houses than in area. The three"], [35, "/fccesns o^^^wn-^e.-r^J . CertJCyJUfity-.P/MAJir*."], [36, ""], [37, "THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. 9 larger hills, of five on the peninsula where it was built, were still covered by pastures or mowing lots, and dotted by trees, which on some of the maps are profuse. Gen. Dearborn, how ever, says that there were none \" except some half a dozen lo custs, as many soverns, and a few apple-trees.\" Two or three huge elms, one of which is yet living, are said to have remained. On looking around the occupied part of the territory it would, so far as we can suppose or know, have been seen, if we landed by the ferry from Boston (at the old, or Charles River Bridge), that along the low shore eastward there were wharves, and back of them a dock extending to the present Chelsea Street. Around the dock were distilleries, a tan-yard, warehouses, and the premises of coopers, shipwrights, and others engaged in commerce, while among, or a little back of, them, and spread for perhaps a quarter of a mile, were dwellings. Directly in land from the ferry, a short street, lined by shops and houses, led to an irregularly shaped market-place surrounded by simi lar buildings. At the left, and projecting boldly into it, were a garden and the chief inn, \" The Three Cranes,\" behind which were the homes of the two ministers. Close by the latter stood the Meeting-House, with a rather tall, slim steeple, and in, not by, the market-place (as often in old English towns), was the Court-House. Farther to the left, along the river-side, there were, as to the eastward, wharves, warehouses, a ship-chand lery shop or two, and dwellings near by, as well as a distillery, and at a little distance farther another one. On and around the Town Hill, just north of the market-place, were more dwell ings ; others stood about the junction of Joiner and Warren streets, a few by the Training-field, and at the corner of the lane leading to it was another distillery. Winding around the hill, and then for a mile northward to the Neck, was the main road, narrow or wide, crooked or straight, as the lay of the land determined. On the east side, from the market-place to the present Thompson Square, was a succession of houses, almost without a break ; for between them were only small gardens or areas, and three narrow lanes that led to the Back street. Nearly opposite the present Union Street was one more distil lery, or a part of it. On the other side of the street the houses"], [38, "10 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. were not as closely set, and a little way above Wood Street they were scattered. Near the foot of Green Street stood a house and a barn, then there seems to have been open ground to a house at the corner of Hathoii Place. Aside from the Main Street there seem to have been few houses. Beyond these limits, the buildings on Main Street were more separated for a third of a mile to a somewhat compact group, \u2014 the Mill Vil lage. Beyond this, for half a mile, was land mostly open (see p. 152) as far as the Neck Village (pp. 152, 153). On the mainland along the roads to Penny ferry (Maiden bridge), to Medford and Cambridge, there were several houses and barns, and over a mile from the Neck, near Medford river, was the Ten Hills farm (p. 154). It will be observed that the buildings of the town were set closely along or near the sea-front from the present Navy Yard to the lower part of Bow Street, and in an almost unbroken line on Main Street to Thompson Square. A large part of them were built of wood, and among them scattered barns, several distilleries, and other inflammable structures. Conse quently, when fires were kindled in the lower portion of the town, and the wind changed from southwest, as it was blowing (says Dearborn) to eastward, as it often does on a summer day, the flames were driven lengthwise of the town and burned as far as they could reach material to maintain them. Thus the main part of the town was easily destroyed, continuing to burn through the night (says H. Hulton). Some buildings, however, midway on Main Street (p. 149), and at the Mill Vil lage (p. 151), were not reached by the fire, but guns were brought to rake the Neck (p. 152) and neighboring territory, and no little damage was done there (pp. 152-154). As to how the town looked before the conflagration, we can form a tolerably clear idea, even in the absence of definite views and connected descriptions. We can feel pretty sure that, ac cording to the Provincial way, English fashions were followed as far as means allowed, and that the town was not better than one in England made during the earlier half of the last century, when the style of building in such was plain, or at best quaint, and the structures apt to be small. A considerable difference"], [39, "11 THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. would, of course have been made by the prevalent use of wood here instead of bricks. Probably some of the low, quaint houses left at the North End of Boston are not unlike many of those that-were burned here. From the sizes of many lots, the length of time families had occupied them, or the valuations for losses, we are led to think that there could have been but few fine places. Old accounts, indeed, state that many buildings were \" large and elegant,\" but definitions and ideas of elegance were then very different from those we have, as witness English de scriptions of mutilations in English cathedrals. Two very detailed accounts are preserved of the houses of two prominent men in the town, which are given hereafter, \u2014 those of Captain Henley (pp. 118, 119) and B. Hurd (p. 138). There are several statements to show that the destruction was not at first complete, and that it ended by degrees. The Rev. Andrew Elliot says (Boston, June 19), \" I suppose every dwell ing-house and every public building is consumed till you have passed the passage to the mills, and are come to the house where Woods, the Baker, dwelt\" (see p. 149). This refers to the region on Main Street north of Thompson Square, and ground of some extent where the buildings were too widely separated for the fire to spread, and the one part of the town least exposed to the British guns. On the map of Page, and on that of De Berniere, not only are no houses marked in the main part of the town, but it is, in type, stated to be the part burned, and they are marked in this region. On the latter map, and on the ground just mentioned, is placed a barn (near the foot of Green St.), from which Americans fired on the left flank of the British at the final attack on the Hill, and from which they were driven by \" part of the 47th and Marines.\" A building, without description, is marked in the same place on the maps of Page and of Swett. Furthermore, on the map of De Berniere, where houses are shown in this region, is also shown the position of the \" 47th Regiment in Charles-town on the night of the 17th.\" It was posted for nearly half a mile along Main Street where guarding was, it seems, not needed except at the causeway, or milldam, at the further end of their line, but where it seems likely there were houses for shelter."], [40, "12 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Additional evidence in regard to the gradual destruction is given by a public document. At a Town meeting, Jan. 11, 1783, a committee of seven of the inhabitants appointed to esti mate the losses in the fire, reported that the greatest part of the town \" was consumed on the first day ; the next day they [the British] renewed the fire, and consumed a large number of houses, and so continued from time to time, until the whole was destroyed.\" (Mass. Archives, 138, and Memorial, Ho. Doc, 55, 23d Congress.) A number of houses even remained for six months, and a few for a longer time, and were used by the British, as is shown in a letter of Gen. Washington to Jos. Reed, Jan. 14, 1776, where it is stated that a few nights before (Jan. 8), \" a party under Major Knowlton crossed upon the mill-dam [between the Am. station at Cobble Hill and the Mill Village described pp. 150, 151], the night being dark, and set fire to and burnt down eight out of fourteen [houses] which were standing, and which we found they were daily pulling down for fuel.\" (Sparks's \" Writ ings,\" III. 241 ; also E. N. Coburn in \" Charlestown,\" 1875.) About the aggregate amount of the losses no two accounts seem to agree. In the report of Jan. 11, 1783 (above), it is stated that nineteen sworn appraisers made the sum total \u00a3117,675. 14s. According to the Archives (pp. 157-174), it was .\u00a3123,444. 8. 6. In pencil on the MS., by a later hand, is Total, \u00a3117,982. 5. 2d., the figures given by Mr. Frothingham (\"Siege,\" 203). On the Church Record (heliotyped in the writer's 4\u00b0 vol.) is an entry stating that \" 380 dwelling-houses and other buildings, valued at \u00a3156,966. 18. 8d., were con sumed, and 2,000 persons reduced from affluence & mediocrity to the most aggravated exile.\" As to the number of buildings, there is a still greater diversity of statement. It is even diffi cult to obtain exact figures of the latter from the papers writ ten by the sufferers themselves when reporting to the committee, as buildings may be counted different ways, and in several cases fractions are given. No total \"footings\" appear with these, but the writer counts from them, with at least approxi mate exactness, 232 dwellings, 95 barns, 76 shops or stores, 25 warehouses, 12 mills, and 81 miscellaneous buildings, besides"], [41, "13 THE TOWN BURNED IN 1775. 17 wharves, and 205 claims for personal losses only, making 521 buildings, owned by nearly 500 persons, or about 700 suf ferers, a majority of whom represented families, so that it is easy to see that fully \" 2,000 persons \" were immediately and severely affected. Of individuals or families (including all of a name) meeting with losses, 42 lost between \u00a3700. and \u00a31,000., and 27 above the latter amount, as may be counted. Ten sums at least were over \u00a32,000.: Russells, \u00a35,955.; Henley (S.), \u00a34,941.; Rands, \u00a33,788.; Frothinghams, \u00a33,353.; Harrises, \u00a33,192. ; Austins, \u00a33,159. ; Woods, \u00a33,011. ; Cheevers, \u00a32,497. ; Carys, \u00a32,252. ; and Fosters, \u00a32,063. For a month or more before the battle it seems to have been felt that property was very unsafe on the peninsula, conse quently much of the more portable kinds was hidden or re moved. Yet the losses were extremely severe, for houses, stores, workshops, barns, and many other things must remain on the spot. After all the efforts that were made to save per sonal estate, the amount destroyed was important enough to seriously affect business and domestic life, to ruin many of the people, and to cripple a greater number. No more interesting and pathetic evidence of the condition and trials of the inhab itants is to be found than in the collection of statements (443) of individual losses preserved among the Town Records ; in deed, it may be, no other town of the Revolutionary period has such a full and touching exhibit of whom and what its people were, and of what they suffered in the cause of country and independence. He or she must be a cold-blooded and heartless American who can look over these worn or time-stained papers without emotion, and without appreciating the situation and feelings of the persons who wrote them. Generally it is simply stated that the buildings and effects were lost by the military operations, by the acts of the \" Regulars,\" or the \" King's troops,\" yet, now and then, the provocation was too strong for calm mention of the agents of destruction, and they are referred to as the \" ministerial Butchers.\" Charlestown had slight cause to speak otherwise of the representatives of the \" mother coun try \" \u2014 anything but an \" alma mater \" \u2014 across the sea. So far as we can judge from these statements, most of the"], [42, "14 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. silver ware was removed, for little is mentioned. Specifica tions of the quality of furniture are so generally made that we can tell closely who had the finer kinds and how much they had. Of about 450 families or persons claimants, 43 had ma hogany (in all, 64 tables, 23 chairs, 12 desks, 29 seaboards, 3 cases drawers, 9 sundry articles), and 53 had black walnut fur niture ; 40 lost books (\u00a330. old tenor being the largest single claim, and there being no evidence of anything like a library), and 26 had pictures (Ellery, Russell, and Sheafe lost the chief, but none are costly, and 119 averaged only 3s. 3d. each in the owner's valuations). Chests of drawers (now in great request) were not uncommon, and were among the best articles of fur niture. Spinning-wheels and pewter plates were rather numer ous ; there were fewer warming-pans, and few clocks ; there was not much liquor, but there were many cider barrels, and barrels of soap. A majority of claimants on loss of personal property reported kitchen furniture, as that would be among the things least likely to be removed. Small articles of this kind, as well as tools, and indeed of all sorts are often described with great detail. (See Note, p. xiv.) The people who bore these losses were, moreover, scattered widely to find refuge, and some were never to return. Public or private help for current necessities was given, but there was slight insurance, and full, or even partial, remuneration was never obtained. (See p. 22.) Charlestown, it might be fairly said, was unanimously rebel, or patriot; for there was only one resident loyalist, Thos. Danforth, who was also the solitary lawyer in the place. One other of his party, Thos. Flucker, owned land (Plan III. 84), but lived in Boston. The people proved their patriotism and took the consequences, \u2014 they were left with honest hearts, clear consciences, and depleted pocket books. Yet, while the majority were financially crippled, or ruined, their sacrifice \u2014 for they had shunned no risk \u2014 was perhaps the strongest possible means for rousing their country men to the struggle for national existence. Certainly to this end they did their full part. While what they were in politics, they were almost as unani mously Congregationalists in religion, and with few exceptions"], [43, "15 THE REBUILDING OF THE TOWN. English in origin. Socially they were rather more diversified. There was little of the old tory official or fashionable element, only a moderate amount of higher education, and there were few or none of the leisure class, as it is called. Apart from a few persons engaged in commerce, the richest were the distil lers ; next were the bakers ; both of their kinds of business seeming to have been among the necessities. The general community was intelligent, thrifty, comfortable ; it was orderly and quiet, yet it probably enjoyed itself, although in ways that might now appear simple. Going to meeting on Sunday was much more common ; there were no comic operas, or \" sacred \" concerts ; schools were kept at small cost ; scholars were not crammed with scraps of arts and ologies ; nearly every one could read and write, although, as appears from the statements of losses, spelling by nearly all was eccentric, or, it might be said, incorrect. Neither literature, cooking, nor amusements were varied, yet there was a generation of good citizens, fond of old homes, and devoted to country. Great sufferers in the struggle for the independence of their native land, they were in some degree exiles awhile, then, as best they could, some of them sought their old familiar haunts. THE REBUILDING OF THE TOWN. In 1777, as is stated in the Records of the First Parish, the few who began to return to the town found \" in their then dis tressed situations \" no better place for public worship or meet ings, for a schoolroom, as well as \" for other necessary purposes,\" than \" an old Block House [on the present site of the First Church] left by the British army in 1776. . . . There . . . united by a recollection of their mutual sufferings, and a respect for their venerable pastor,\" they \" attended with grateful emotions the public services of religion,\" and there, probably, \" the first administration of the Lord's Supper [says Mr. Prentice] in Charlestown since the destruction of the cruellest British Ene mies, was Nov. 8, 1778, with great solemnity and fulness of members beyond expectation\" (Ch. Ree, 1778). There also, \" uninfluenced by political dissensions,\" says one of them, Dr."], [44, "16 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Bartlett (1813), \"we gave our first suffrages (Sep. 4,1780) . . . under the constitution of this Commonwealth ; when . . . we exulted in the commencement of a government, acchieved by our ablest statesmen.\" There were forty-eight votes cast. These, and other particulars show that some of the people began at an early date after the departure of the Royal forces (Mch., 1776) to return, and \" to repair their waste places. A few of the number were able to erect convenient dwellings, whilst others, like their hardy predecessors, were only covered with temporary shelters\" (Dr. Bartlett, 1813). That a few, at least, of some sort, were soon provided, is shown by the fact, although statements of it differ, that in Nov. 1776, Susanna Hooper was the first child, and Feb. 24, 1777, Tim0 Thompson, Jr., was the first male, born on the peninsula after the return. In regard to the first dwelling erected, there are also differ ent statements (pp. 144 and 149), and it is probable that sev eral were begun or finished at about the same time. It was not, however, until the end of active warfare that a general movement seems to have been made to rebuild, when there was no longer risk of exposure to armed vessels, that in 1775 had given the townspeople such a dismal experience. Meanwhile the affairs of local government were duly attended to; town meetings were held, some of the time at Anna Whit temore's Inn, and officers were chosen. On June 20, 1780, at one of these meetings, it was voted \" that all streets, lanes, etc., within the neck shall be laid open from the first day of May next\" (1781). In this latter year Acts of the Legislature were obtained \" for the better Regulation of the Ferry \" to Bos ton (May 16), and (Oct. 30) \"for widening and amending the Streets, Lanes, and Squares, in that part of the Town which was lately laid waste by Fire.\" The latter Act was supple mented by another, in 1790, \" for the Relief of the Town,\" by extending time allowed for raising money by Lottery to pay for these improvements, the chief of which were in clearing the market-place of a block (Plan I., 1) covered with ruins, in forming Water, Henley, and the lower part of Warren streets from crooked lanes, and in removing some irregularities from Main Street (Plan III.). No map of any fulness or correct-"], [45, "17 THE REBUILDING OF THE TOWN. ness remains, or, it may be, ever was made ; but an account of such sketches as there are is given in the survey of the town (p. 112). New public buildings became necessary, and another site for the meeting-house, the former one on the Square having been appropriated by the Town. Consequently, Sep. 10, 1781, a vote was passed \" to choose a committee to solicit subscriptions of the good friends of the town throughout the state, to assist in building a meeting-house,\" and Oct. 27, 1782, \" after much de bate\" a \"resolution1 was come into\" about the position of the edifice, to be the one place of worship in the town, a place of which it was then destitute. In the next year the house was raised and opened for use, but it had temporary seats and an unfinished steeple until 1787. Descriptions of it, and of its successor, will be found in a chapter on the meeting-houses. The school had temporary quarters until 1786, when it was voted in Town meeting to sell the old schoolhouse and build a new one, for which \u00a3100. were to be raised. Other public in stitutions were provided for even earlier, as March 4, 1782, it was voted to build a Workhouse for the poor, and, in 1784, to have a pair of stocks made. The ferry to Boston was main tained by twelve men with four boats plying, March to October from sunrise till nine in the evening, and during the other months until eight. In Sep., 1783, the Warren Tavern (Plan III., 72) was already occupied, and there, during the autumn, the first 3fasonic Lodge, King Solomon's, was fully organized.

In the former there were also 550 inhabitants (537 whites, 13 blacks) and 141 ratable polls, and in the latter 449 (441 whites, 8 blacks) and 103 polls. Another important work, that was of a public as well as pri vate nature, was also undertaken, when, after deliberation and meetings, eighty-nine gentlemen were organized as a corpora tion for building, and for supporting during forty years, a bridge to Boston on the line of the old ferry, an Act to that effect having been passed by the Legislature, March 9, 1785.1 At the close of the year, a neivspaper, the only one then pub lished in Middlesex County, was first issued (Dec. 9, 1785), although the proprietors stated that \" their number of subscrip tions was considerably less than what was thought necessary \" for advantageously beginning the work.2 In the first and sec ond numbers a townsman (Dr. Bartlett) gave an authentic account of the existing condition of the place.

A devas tating trial by war only eleven years before, was commemorated by a great and beneficial triumph of peace. Charles River Bridge was opened,1 for the first time affording a roadway to Boston, or across the waters that nearly environed the most populous section of the town. Compared with similar struct ures in many older countries, it was a simple and insubstantial work ; compared with the means of the builders and like things then in their country, it was \" considered as the greatest,\" and was immense. The project had been first discussed as early as 1720, but without any such results until this time, when its success led to the construction of a bridge to Maiden, opened 1787, and another, to Chelsea, built in 1803. These new and important means for communication were of great benefit.2 1 The opening \"summoned from all parts upwards of 20,000 spectators. The morn was ushered in by a discharge of thirteen cannon from the opposite heights of Breed's Hill, Charlestown, and Cop's Hill, Boston, accompanied by repeated peals from the bells of Christ Church. At one p. H. the proprietors assembled in the State House for the purpose of waiting on the different branches of the legislature over the bridge. The procession consisted of almost every respectable character in public and private life, . . . and upon their arrival at the entrance of the bridge, the attendant companies of artillery and artificers formed two lines on the right and left of the proprietors, and moved on to the centre of the bridge, when the Presi dent of the proprietary advanced alone and gave orders to Mr. Cox, the master workman, to fix the drawer for the passage of the company, which was immediately done. At this moment 13 cannon were fired from Cop's Hill, and the procession passed forward, attended by the loudest shouts of acclamation.\" On Breed's Hill 800 persons dined, \" spent the day in sober festivity,\" and \" separated at 6 o'clock.\" (Mass.

Before the Revolution a few printing establishments were quite sufficient for the needs of New England. Most of the important books could be advantageously supplied from the mother country, while native works were not numerous enough to give adequate business to many presses. After Independence local demands increased, and distant relations were changed. Presses were established in an almost surprising number of places where they were novelties, and a great deal of what is termed job-work was done on them, as well as what was called for in their neighborhoods. In Charlestown, a growing place, there was naturally a press set up, and about three months after the first newspaper was issued from it, appeared the first work (Bib., p. 32) in book or pamphlet form printed there (so far as the writer has found). It was the Oration delivered by Dr. Bartlett at the Dedication of Warren Hall (p. 135), March 14, 1786, by which it was incidentally shown that the popula tion had already become large enough to make a hall wanted. This one was finished by Feb. 10, 1786. As had been the case from the beginning, the townspeople, with few exceptions, continued to unite in the support of a single religious organization. After the death (June 17, 1782) of their aged pastor, the Rev. Thos. Prentice, the pulpit was sup plied \" by the kind assistance of the neighboring ministers,\" until Jan. 1787, when the Rev. Joshua Paine was ordained. He was highly esteemed, but died of consumption at the age of 24, on the 27th of Feb., 1788. On the 30th of April, 1789, the Rev. Jedidiah Morse was installed pastor. For twelve years he was the one settled minister of the town, and for thirty years and ten months officiated in the First Church ; consequently it is of interest to learn the characteristics of the man thus chosen. Descended in the fifth generation from Anthony Morse, of Marlborough, Wilts, and born (Aug. 23, 1761) at Woodstock, Conn., he became a very prominent clergyman, and the most voluminous author who has lived in the town.

One who thoroughly knew him says that he had a \" tall, slen der form. The well-shaped head, a little bald, but covered thinly with fine silken powdered hair, falling gracefully into curl, gave him, when only middle-aged, a venerable aspect, while the benignant expression of his whole countenance, and especially of his bright, speaking eye, won for him at first sight respect and love.\" His \"freedom from every offensive habit, his neat dress, polished manners,\" avoidance of \" every word and look that might wound the feelings of another, ... in short, his true Christian gentlemanliness, . . . gave him a deep hold on . . . the religious community.\" (Prof. M. in \" Sprague's Life,\" pp. 281, 282.) His ability and character during life were also demonstrated in his sons, men such as come of no inferior stock. He lived here at a period of ex citement and trial, when he was sharply attacked.

Small help to them, but much honor to the place, that they lived here ; Charlestown can ill afford a slur on Jedidiah Morse, it can far better afford him a statue. When he was installed there were, as he recorded, 135 church members, 92 of whom were females (40 married, 12 single, and the remarkably large number of 40 widows). His salary, said to have been exceptionally good, was $572, besides firewood and the use of a parsonage. Further evidence of the small scale of expenditures is shown by the appropriations for civil affairs. For schools the town voted \u00a3150. ; for highways, \u00a390. ; for support of the poor, \u00a3200.; while for Town Clerk (Sam! Payson), for Treasurer (Ebenr Breed), and for Sexton the salary was \u00a310. each.1 At 1 In this year (Apr. 6, 1789) the Selectmen, who were also the School Commit tee, were Isaac Mallet, Sr., Nath1.

Some public and private aid had been extended to support individuals, chiefly aged or infirm, \" and the state taxes were remitted for seven years \" (Dr. B.). The only other help was a lottery author ized for raising funds to alter the streets. Even of this the committee on it reported, June 19, 1789, \" that the rapid de preciation of the Continental Currency [had] deprived the town of any Benefit from the three classes which [had] been drawn ; \" indeed, there was not enough obtained to compensate the man agers for their services. The two most prominent inhabitants \u2014 Hon. N. Gorham and Hon. T. Russell \u2014 had been appointed as early as 1777 to ask relief from Congress, but it could give none ; and in 1784 the former was, against the wish of many, sent to England for aid, that was also there sought in vain. To complete the account of efforts made and failure met in the same purpose, it may be added that as long afterwards as 1834, Congress received a memorial of the citizens praying compen sation, and let them haye their labor for their pains taken. Charlestown was allowed the American privilege, a chance to pay its own bills and to make its own way. It did both, and we can look along its history and see how it turned out in life. THE NEW TOWN.

On computation by the writer it appears that there were 867 males, and 812 females, or a total of 1579, of which 744 were adults, 820 children, and 15 uncertain. Of adults with children, there were 175 married couples, 23 widowers, 37 widows ; of those without children, there were 81 men and 99 women, single. Of persons called servants there were 40 males, 34 females, and 2 uncertain. Among 454 families and single persons, 67 had servants, and of these Sam! Ireland had 4, Benj. Frothingham and Daniel Reed each had 3, and nine had 2 each. Several of the older or prominent inhabitants had none, as was the case with Dr. J. Bartlett, Geo. Bartlett, Benj. Hurd (Sr. and Jr.), and Hon. Nath! Gorham (with eight children), while others had but one, as had Hon. Jas. Russell, Matthew Bridge, Sam. Swan, Wm. Hunnewell, Sam. Henley, Nath! Austin, and others. Evidently there was a very simple style of living, and the women who were heads of families had not the many and engrossing calls upon their time and strength now made ; yet the minor cares of daily life, and the exceptional labors attendant on the re establishment of homes and town, must have been trying. There seems to have been no excess of amusement, but, very likely, a fair amount of quiet family or neighborly visiting. Travelling was slow and expensive. Immigration was from places at no great distance, and scarcely any of it was foreign. Some per sons or families during and after the war removed to what were then remote and newer regions, such as southern New Hampshire and eastern New York, going in the saddle over imperfect roads, in a way more adventurous than removals are now, even to the far Northwest or California. While these sought new homes, the majority returned to the old ; and while some recovered former prosperity, others were seriously affected. times so cramped that words are indistinct.

The growth of the town during the ensuing years was con slant, as it has been shown to have already been, \u2014 a fact ap parent in figures at several dates that can be advantageously seen together. In 1775 there were 380 buildings on the penin sula (Ch. Ree.) ; in 1785 there were 151 on it, and 279 in the whole town, and the population was 999 (Am. Recorder) ; four years later it was 1,579 (census). The natural increase, 1790-96, is shown by the Church Record (p. 255). In 1800 the town contained 349 buildings, and 2,751 inhabitants (Morse), and in 1805 about 400 buildings on the peninsula, and about 2,800 inhabitants. The latter in 1810 were 4,736 (Dr. B.) ; in 1834 about 10,000 (Directory) ; in 1840, 10,872 ; in 1850, 15,933 ; in 1855, 21,742; in 1865, 26,398; in 1870, 28,323; in 1885, 37,673 (the last six by census). After observing as we have the start of the renewed town, we can perhaps most clearly understand its development in dif ferent ways byT following separately its religious, political, and business history through its first half-century, then through its second, and afterwards looking at various buildings, all in some degree indicative of that history, and of the thought, con dition, and life of the people. RELIGIOUS HISTORY. 1783-1834. During the earlier part, perhaps half, of this period, the old order in matters of faith continued substantially as it had from the beginning of the town, that is, with one church, ministry, and creed, \u2014 the Trinitarian Congregational; of which from 1789 to 1819 there was one minister, Dr. Morse. The changes in opinion or belief that arose in the new nation, however, soon became marked in religion. In 1801 the Baptists -\u25a0 withdrew or organized, but their num bers, at first only eleven, were for some time small, and no great general change at an early date occurred. They, however, 1 The ministers (1801-36) were the Rev. Thomas Waterman, ins. Oct. 7, 1802, to June, 1803 ; the Rev. Wm. Collier, ins. May 3, 1804, resigned Aug. 20, 1819 ; the Rev. Henry Jackson, ord. Nov. 27, 1822, res. Oct., 1836."], [57, "RELIGIOUS HISTORY. 1783-1834. 25 increased, then decreased awhile, until, during the ministry of the Rev. Henry Jackson (1822\u201436), revivals were frequent, and there were large additions to the membership. Besides paying its expenses, the society raised annually \" an average of more than a thousand dollars \" for general religious and benevolent purposes. At the beginning of his ministry there were 79 members, and during it a net increase of 206. Under the auspices of the society, the Charlestown Female Seminary, long an excellent school, was instituted in 1831 (Hist. Ch., 1852). The Congregationalists continued (at least until 1810) to include a very large part of the townspeople. Of church mem bers there were in 1789, 135 (43 m., 92 f.) ; in 1800, 143 (28 m., 115 f.); in 1S06 (June 10), 235 (64 m., 171 f.). Thence to the end of 1818 the admissions to the First Church were 166 (36 in., 130 f.). Temporal, in distinction from religious, affairs were, before the Revolution, managed in the town-meetings, but not long after that time a separation of religious and secu lar concerns took place. The former were acted on in the meeting-house, and for their better management the pew-holders were incorporated as the First Parish in 1803, when there were 238 members. To this arrangement there was opposition that expressed itself to the Legislature in 1812 by a remonstrance signed by 76 persons, and thus apparently formidable ; but of the names, 43 represented members of other societies, and 9 were of minors (Par. Ree, 168). A result was an additional and amendatory Act (1812), making the proprietors of pews solely voters, liable for parish taxes, to which right no member of another religious society was entitled. Meanwhile the First Universalist Society1 (the third promi nent church in the town) was formed (1810) and incorporated (1811). Frothingham, Harris, Rand, Wood, and other names of old resident families were represented, yet the society in cluded many of the increasing newer population of the town, and a noticeable proportion of the younger people. The meet ing-house erected (1810) by this society (p. 56) shows to our 1 The ministers to 1836 were the Reverends Abner Kneeland, 1811-14 ; Edward Turner, 1814-25; Calvin Gardner, 1825-27; J. S.

Continuously, also, it has represented itself by some of the most distinguished ministers of its denomination, the Rev. Ed ward Turner (1814-25), the Rev. E. H. Chapin, D. D. (1840 46), the Rev. Thomas Starr King (1846-49), and the Rev. C. F. Lee (now pastor), all of whom have been well known offi cially and as writers. During the political agitation that prevailed through the coun try in the latter part of the last century, and for some time into the present, the townspeople became divided. With simi lar vigor differing religious opinions were held, and a memo rable rupture among the Congregationalists ensued here, as in Boston and its vicinity. Long before the crisis, however, there was such a lack of harmony that Dr. Morse (Nov. 12, 1802), \" after prayerful consideration,\" submitted to the church the question, \" whether it be not expedient that the Pastoral rela tion between us be dissolved ? \" This was voted on, and unani mously answered in the negative. He gave a fair opportunity to some who had known him for years, and who afterwards strongly opposed him. There was soon, notwithstanding, trouble about his salary, \u2014 then settled (1803) at $972 cash, 20 cords of wood, valued at $120, and rent of the parsonage at $300. It may be added that the salary of the organist at that time was $80. Still, it was stated (Jan. 6, 1804) that men of eminent \" respectability, influence, and standing,\" refused to pay their part \"unless compelled by Law.\" Indeed, there ap pears reason for thinking that the Parish Committee knew what it was reporting when it declared (1812) that \" disagree ments and altercations had arisen to such a state\" (1797) that \" most of the business was disposed of in an unprecedented maner [sic'], and happy would it have been\" if any plan \" could have destroyed the demon of discord.\" Even \" time, the common antidote of contention,\" did not produce its \" usual effect,\" and then (1812) \" the embers of discord [were] again bursting to a flame.\" When in addition to such differences about temporal affairs, grave diversity of religious belief was developed, a separation occurred.

Theological characteristics of the two parties thus existing are well known and need not be described here ; but it is of interest to observe how, at this important point, the people immediately and subsequently be came grouped. As under the institutions of the country, the majority ruled. Possession of the ancient organization, of the meeting-house, and of other church property remained with the Trinitarians, who numbered at least seven out of eight, probably a larger proportion of the church members, and a conclusive majority of the parishioners.1 At first the old church lost about one quarter of its income by the departures to the newer, but in nine months it gained 83 communicants, five times as many as had thus gone.2 Through the period of the division there appears to have been temperate and honor able action on both sides. The record of the First Church is 1 The Parish Committee at this period consisted (1815) of Tim? Walker, Isaac Warren (1815-18), Amos Tufts (1815-18), Matthew Skilton (also 1818), David Stetson, John Soley, Thos. Osgood. In 1816-17, Asher Adams, Jas. Warren, and Sam1. Kidder replaced four, and in 1S17-18, Thos. Kettell and Oliver Jaquith re placed the last two named. The Deacons, all of whom remained in the First Church, were Thos. Miller (chosen 1787, died 1832, aged 85), James Frothingham (do., 1793-1820, \u00e6. 85), Amos Tufts (do., 1804-39, \u00e6. 77). 2 The division extended to families, and social or other than theological causes had an effect, yet relationship or intimacies helped to keep some together. Politics were so strongly felt that they may have had some influence. It was a period of changes in most things. Many of the old resident families had gone or were les sened in members. The Russells, for instance, were represented in name by one maiden lady, and the Gorhams by a single man (much of his life not a householder). Bradstreets, Devenses, Frothinghams, and others were on both sides ; indeed, on both there were good and valuable people, and of them and their successors, in each faith, the writer has known and esteemed so many that he prefers to pleasantly re member, rather than to analyze them. Yet it may be added that of the larger prop erties, most of them then newly acquired, a good deal was represented in the newer church, as also was social prominence, and a good share of the moderate number of persons in town who had a collegiate education, or that acquired by any wide study of the world. In the older remained the two men of intellect since most widely known, and from it date two others, authors, Morse and Devens, whose works have had by far the greatest circulation of any by residents or natives. While composed as the second church was of all classes, and of older and newer residents, it was for years the more fashionable ; at the same time the first held by far the larger number of communicants. For perhaps twenty years the numbers of the two were nearly equal ; afterwards the Trinitarians largely increased in this way as well as in expenditures (see p. 39)."], [60, "28 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. dispassionate and dignified, and avoids partisan expressions. Neither side had a monopoly of the graces, or of liberality, and no history of the town, or of the good works done in it, is complete without an expression of the valuable labors of both branches of the Congregationalists. More of the history of the First Church need not be given here, as it is sketched on pages 175 to 191, and an account of its meeting-houses appears in the section relating to such buildings. In 1819 the Unitarians1 erected a meeting-house (p. 56) that is to-day (1887)a proof of their early abilities and of their long devotion. Their organization, building, their good works in benevolence, and many of their efforts to animate social life around them have been honorable to themselves and to their denomination. In 1833 a division occurred in organization, but not in faith, among the Trinitarians. The Winthrop Society, with 44 mem bers, was incorporated, and the Rev. D. Crosby was installed August 14th as its pastor (dismissed May 18, 1842). While the older church did not at first recognize the necessity of the division, it proved an event that must have come in time, for not long after it, two meeting-houses were absolutely necessary to accommodate attendants. Almost simultaneously the two societies built brick meeting-houses (pp. 53, 58). The Methodists? beginning with moderate numbers, and in corporated in 1820, were also destined to increase very much in the next half-century. While their first minister, the Rev. Wilbur Fisk, was with them only a short time, as is usual in their organization, he was prominent in it, and was able to give them a good start.

The old practical unity disappeared, great diversity ensued, during the earlier stages of which there was strong feeling, but out of all this the new institutions of the country developed good in each group that was formed. Perhaps it might be broadly stated that the adherents to the old order of thought were chiefly in the First and Winthrop churches ; that those who felt most its restrictions were with the Universalists ; that those longest re pressed but who experienced fully the new liberty were with the Baptists and the Catholics, of which latter the earlier open appearance was towards the end of the period ; that the more fashionable, as well as the more anti-Calvinistic, were with the Unitarians ; that there was a very general attendance at some form of church service, and material as well as other help given it ; and that the results proved that each group of Americans, each in its own way, could do, and did do, credit to itself and good in the community. A Sutiday school is supported by each of these churches. Although the pioneer school in this country, it is said, was be gun as early as 1790, at Philadelphia, and that in Massachusetts by 1810, the first in Boston was opened sometime later. In Charlestown the Baptists had a school taught on Saturday afternoons, and outside the meeting-house, by the minister. This (about 1813) became a Sunday school, still continued. On a larger scale, the First Church established (Oct., 1816) a Sun day school, said to have been the first among the Congregation alists, and also still continued. Connected with its early work and history were several men whose reputation was, or grew to be, national, and ladies whose family names are well known in the town, \u2014 Adams, Evarts, Edes, Harris, Kettell, Payson, and Tufts. Soon after its organization the Winthrop Society began a second Trinitarian school. In 1822 the Methodists formed theirs, that has had twenty or more superintendents, and, since about 1841, an infant department. The Unitarian school was gathered in March, 1828, and the Universalist in May, 1829, and, it may be added here, the Monument Square in 1847. All, or nearly all of these schools now contain as many members as the congregations with which they are connected."], [62, "30 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. POLITICS. 1783-1834. While old forms of organization and management of local public affairs continued, the new national life supplied a far greater variety of subjects for political opinions and actions of wider scope. As independence differed from subjection, so, naturally, would the results of nationality from those of pro vincialism. Parties with different policies of course in time arose. It is pleasant to notice that the patriotic town voted for the great signer of the Declaration, John Hancock, that from it went to the Constitutional Convention its distinguished resident, Nathaniel Gorham, and that it was united under Washington until 1795. Then \" unhappy divisions \" are said to have fol lowed. The national administration was Federalist under President John Adams (1797-1801), and then Republican, that is, Democratic, under the three succeeding administrations (1801-25), varying from intensity through the earlier part of the time to moderation at the close. The State meanwhile was Federalist. Between the two parties the town was not very unequally divided, so that there seems to have been a constant struggle, but most of the time the Democrats \" exclusively ruled \" in local politics and government, except in 1809 and 1812, when a Union ticket prevailed (Dr. B.). The figures of the votes for Governor (Sec. State's records) in years of Presi dential elections give their evidence of the feeling of the people, and also of their numbers, in the following table where the names of candidates elected are shown by italics : \u2014 Federalist.

In 1817 appears to have been the one victory of the Federal ists, who in the latter part of this period were succeeded by the Whigs as the opponents of the Democrats. Local subjects and political contests are sometimes exciting, but as time goes on they generally leave slight show of special or personal distinc tions. As is apt to be the American result, here the general work of fair or good government was accomplished ; a large number of men filled offices and did their part in their day or generation, and the institutions of the people were served and perpetuated. The little world here moved and proved itself a good American town, and that was enough. BUSINESS. 1783-1834. An intelligent and thrifty community, intent on business, and availing itself of the new opportunities that came along with new national life, would show an important part of its history in private and public undertakings for material gain and im provement. Besides what could be done in its particular sphere, it would also show what would be thought of, tried, and accomplished in an American town of its period. Streets (1783, etc.), roads, and bridges (1785-87), the simplest forms of public improvement in communications, had been opened, and then what had been, and were, the chief and best means for reaching distant places were sought. In 1793, the Propri etors of the Middlesex Canal were incorporated, and if its connection with Charlestown was simply that it started there, and a few of its corporators or stockholders lived in the place, the work was an important one to the town. It was one of the very earliest undertakings of the kind in the country, and was to connect tide-water with the upper Merrimac. Progress was slow. Not until Aug. 2, 1794, was the survey completed, and only in 1803 was the canal opened. Even slower was the operation of making the work profitable. Between January, 1794, and Sept. 1, 1819, a hundred assessments were laid, so that the net cost of each share was then $1,455, \" and no divi dend could be or was declared until Feb. 1,\" in the latter year. Even when income was really obtained it was very small, the"], [64, "32 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. average for the twenty-four years during which it was paid being only l-^ per cent. Finally the railroad ended the business, the charter was forfeited (1860), and the canal de stroyed. Surveying appears to have been such a very inexact science with the builders that remarkable mistakes were made in determining water levels (Eddy, Hist., 4), and the banks and other parts were so imperfectly built that incessant repairs were for a long while required. Furthermore, Mr. Sullivan's first report (1809) as agent, stated (p. 6) that \" scarcely any corporate property depends more on the commerce of our country than the canal,\" and that this one had been \" almost wholly deprived of income from carrying a main article, lum ber ; consequently \" that tolls for the year had been only $7,237.93. Whatever were the pecuniary results of the work, the enterprise of the proprietors was shown, and their business sagacity should not be impeached, for they did their best under the circumstances. Turnpikes were another public improvement, long tried in England, and then built in America ; and although the geog raphy of Charlestown did not admit any great development of them there, one for Salem started (1802) from the Square, and another for Medford crossed (1803) more of the town. Besides these, connections were also made with similar roads beyond its territory. Meanwhile, and for years later, private enterprise was en gaged in buying and selling real estate, and in reconstructing and enlarging the town. Indeed, for a considerable time these operations were like what is now going on in many a new place in the country. At and after the rebuilding, both nati-fes and new-comers were thus occupied, some of them on quite an ex tensive scale. Of the former, or of the older inhabitants, Nathaniel Austin was active (to 1814) in all, but chiefly the central, parts of the town; Eben! Breed (do.), largely towards the Point; Dea. David Goodwin, a builder and of the Baptist church, for about thirty years, on Town Hill, and Bow and Washington streets ; Dea. John Larkin, First Church (to 1803), in sundry parts and on Breed's Hill ; John Hay (to 1800), chiefly on Main Street (Plan IV.) ; Caleb Swan (1783-"], [65, "33 BUSINESS. 1783-1834. 1810), on Main, Bow, and Back streets, as well as in other places ; David Wood (to 1796), on Main Street (Plan IV.), on the mainland, and (do.) D. Wood, Jr. (to 1806) on Main Street. Joseph Hurd, and Dr. Isaac Rand also did considera- ble after the war. Of other prominent old names it may be noted that the Russells owned chiefly outside the Neck, and that of the once large possessions of the Bunkers, little re- mained with them at this time other than the pasture that made their name historic. Of new comers or owners, Giles Alexan- der (from Roxbury) was active chiefly (1800-15) on the Hill ; Matthew Bridge (from Lexington, 1785), on the Square, Town Hill, the Dock, and Green Street (to 1814) ; Thos. Brooks, a brickmaker (1792, and the next thirty years), at the Point and the N. and E. parts of the town ; Isaac Carlton, a mason, in sundry parts (1799-1805) ; Jon\" Carlton, a builder (from New York), on Cordis, Main, Austin, streets, etc. (1801-08) ; Capt. Jos. Cordis (1780 and over 20 years after), near the town dock, and over a large area from Maine to High Street (Plan IV.) ; John Harris (1783-1803), and Capt. Thos. Harris (1784-1814), along the river front, largely in Bow Street ; Oliver Holden (from Pepperell, February, 1788), in many parts of the town, especially on Salem Hill (1788, and many years after) ; and Capt. Arch3 McNiel (New York ?), on Union, and all Washington Street (1794 to about 1820). Before the end of the last century, business in real estate began to extend in a way since immensely increased. Tracts of land were bought and new homes were made in what were then distant regions, on or near the frontiers. In this move- ment, Charlestown was notably represented by Nathaniel Gor- ham, who, acting with Oliver Phelps, of Windsor, Conn., and others, bought (1788) a large area in New York, to which Massachusetts had acquired a right. They were to pay in State paper, then worth about half of its nominal value ; but as it rose to par, they could only take a part of the purchase that bore their names. To it the son of Mr. Gordon went (1789), as also did his connection, Wm. Wood. One of the earlier and larger American maps is one of this tract, en graved by A. Doolittle, New Haven. It is a curious demon- 3"], [66, "34 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. stration of the thinly scattered settlements, or grist and saw mills, then existing in what is now a populous region in the western part of the Empire State. In local manufacturing there was also enterprise shown. We are told by a historical writer of the time, and a resident (Dr. Morse, 1805), that at the beginning of the present cen tury the activity and diversity was such that \" pot and pearl ashes, rum, ships, and leather in all its branches,\" were made, as were articles of \" silver, tin, brass, and pewter.\" There were \"three rope-walks\" lately built, and \"trade and naviga tion\" had recently greatly increased. Eight years afterwards, another resident (Dr. Bartlett) printed statistics made by Timothy Thompson, Jr., showing that the annual value of the manufactures was $1,231,663, a little over half of which con sisted of eighteen millions of bricks ($650,000). Morocco was the next article in amount ($225,000) ; cordage was the third ($106,000) ; soap and candles followed ($89,000) ; and \"common weaving\" was last ($2,113). Within three years the making of \" chaises, cordage, morocco, plated ware, and cabinet work \" had \" greatly lessened.\" Six years later it was stated (Dr. Morse, 1819) that \" the manufactures of morocco leather, and of bricks,\" were \" carried on here on a larger scale, probably, than in any other town in the State.\" Large quantities of \" soal leather \" were also made. Clay for the bricks was taken from lands subsequently (1842) in Somer ville. The shipbuilding and ropemaking (except in the Navy Yard) ceased years ago, but some of the other kinds of busi ness mentioned are still (1887) continued. Banking facilities appear to have been near enough at hand in Boston until 1825, when the Bunker Hill Bank1 was incor porated with a capital of $150,000. This amount has been increased, and now is $500,000. Continuously, although in two buildings on one spot (p. 121) this institution has been very successful. In 1832, the Charlestown Bank,2 and the 1 The Presidents have been, Tim0. Walker, David Devens, Edward Lawrence, and T. T. Sawyer. ! The Presidents were, E. D.

The latter was twice as large, but failed in 1842, and the charter was repealed (1845). A Savings Bank was begun in a small way in 1829, by the incorporation of the Warren Institution for Savings.2 At the end of the first year's busi ness the amount on deposit was only $6,145, but so great has been the constant increase that it is now fully four and a quarter millions of dollars. For five and twenty years this was the only bank of the kind in the town. Business in insurance was started by a local company, the Charlestown Fire and Marine, in 1830, but a year afterwards it was moved to Boston and its name changed to the Neptune, subsequently well known and successful. The Charlestown Mutual Fire Insurance Company was incorporated in 1836, but it had not a very long career. CONDITION, 1834. At the end of the first half-century after the rebuilding of the town was fairly begun, there were (as may be counted in the second Directory, 1834) 52 streets, 14 courts, 5 lanes, 3 places, and 23 wharves. On them lived about 10,000 people, for whose use there were 8 meeting-houses, 9 primary and 3 reading and writing schools (the whole cost of which- was only $11,079), 5 engine-houses, and 2 burial-grounds. Names of 8 ministers, 2 doctors, and 6 lawyers are found. There were a brewery, convent, library (the Union), a newsroom, marine railway, pottery, tannery, seminary, and shipyard (at the cor ner of Austin and Washington streets). For seven years a permanent newspaper had been published. Local government was carried on by 73 town officers, including 2 constables, a pound-keeper, and 5 ty thing-men. The military element was 1 The Presidents were, Isaac Fiske (1832-37 ?), Wm. Wyman, 1837-42, and, in closing its affairs, Jas. Hunnewell. 2 The Presidents have been, Tim.

Besides the old Fire Societies (p. 64) there were town engine companies, Hancock 1, Bunker Hill 2, Jefferson 3, Warren 4, Washington 5, with brilliant machines worked by hand, and the \"Hook and Ladder,\" with a carriage of imposing size. The costumes worn by members of these public organizations, when on duty, showed much more lively coloring than is seen now in corre sponding positions. There were canal boats to Lowell, stages thence and elsewhere, \" hourlies \" to Boston, and no railroads. Then, and indeed for years later, from near the Navy Yard to the Neck, there was a large amount of pasture or vacant land along, and especially back of, the hills. A part of Moul ton's hill was standing ; clay-pits yawned between it and the slopes northward, and a beach shaded by willows extended beside the upper part of Medford Street. There were stone walls, rail-fences, and barberry bushes on the roadsides just beyond the Neck ; and hardly a road-bed was well made or kept, while cobble-stones were the best that the arts of the time could do for the most travelled part of the chief high way, the Main Street. This was much like such streets found in large country towns. Many of the houses were separated from each other by small strips of garden or grass-ground, and numerous shade trees gave a very pretty effect. Few buildings could be called fine, but many were neat, quaint, and respectable. Of the inhabitants, only twelve, according to the Directory, were colored, and hardly twice that number were of foreign birth. Elsewhere, however, it is stated that in 1830 there were 96 blacks and 530 foreign, in a population of 8,783. Still, two centuries after its settlement, the town continued to be what it always had been, a place almost wholly occupied by people of English descent. The census of the town at different times has already been given (p. 24). By 1834 there was a large number of what were then old settled inhabitants, much attached to the place. Local spirit and enterprise abounded, and there was a proper local pride. It was a town in and of itself, with a history that was esteemed, and a future to be kept as good, or im-"], [69, "CONDITION, 1834. 37 proved. New residents were also continually arriving, and not a few became more permanent than many who moved here earlier in the century, when, although the town attracted a number of well known men or families, it did not long retain them.1 There was so much land then unoccupied by buildings that the town was tried as a place for suburban residences. No person had what would now be thought any large wealth.2 A variety of trades were carried on (1834), but there was no great diversity or amount of manufacturing. Distilling, how ever, continued to be a somewhat prominent industry, and at the wharves there was a fair business. Within the limits of the town there were establishments of far more than local im portance, \u2014 one of the most complete Navy Yards, with the best dry dock and ropewalk in the country ; the State Prison, improved, and solidly built (277 convicts, Oct., 1834) ; and the McLean Asylum for the Insane, opened Oct. 6, 1818, that to the end of 1833 had received 1015 patients. Socially, there was probably more informal visiting than there now is. Family and other groups, as is apt to be the case in an old place of moderate size, were larger, and were intimate. No excess of great parties seems to have occurred. Many of the elegancies as well as conveniences of recent times were not found. Parlors in the best of houses were furnished 1 The Hon. Artemas Ward lived (about 1802-10) on Main Street (p. 147) ; the Hon. Sam. Dana (1808-12) in the Kettell mansion (p. 92) ; Jas. Harrison (1802-12) in what was later called the Baldwin house (p. 96) ; Jeremiah Evarts, the distinguished philanthropist, for some years (to 1817) on Chelsea Street, op posite the Navy Yard ; and the Hon. Edward Everett, while Governor (1836-40), on Harvard Street (p. 129), after living in the Odin house on Winter Hill, then in Charlestown. 2 By the long Parish list of 1807, only five persons had an income of $1,000 or over, estimated at 6 per cent on the valuation of their property, as it there is, \u2014 Joseph Hurd ($2,538), Richard Devens ($1,994), John Larkin ($1,896), Matthew Bridge ($1,269), and Giles Alexander ($1,224). In 1844, the Town published a list of tax-payers, by which we count 2,777 tax-bills of residents ; of these, 45 are from $100 to $200, 16 from $200 to $300, and only 12 are over that amount, \u2014 David Devens, Jacob Foss (the largest), Jacob Forster, Henry Forster, Jas.

Open fire-places for wood, grates for coal, or a stove, warmed the rooms. A tall bronze astral lamp gave light. Mirrors were a greater luxury ; not apt to be very large, sometimes with square pan elled tops, sometimes circular, and in gilded frames. Bric-a brac was little known. Many of the houses had more or less garden ; here and there it was very small, but altogether the effect along a few of the older streets was very pleasant during summer. The boys of the town fought with those of East Cambridge and the north end of Boston ; and some of the commoner men behaved worse, for more drunkards were seen then than now are, and teamsters not infrequently acted with disgusting brutality, while rowdyism was far from being un known; indeed the one riot in the Town's history occurred near the end of this period. At the same time a very great majority of the people were orderly, attendance at church was much more general than at present, and every one, it might be said, took part in public affairs. Town meetings in the old Hall (p. 71) were often large, and sometimes lively ; and then and later, as now, demagogues made more than their share of noise, but the substantial citizens were apt, in the long run, to keep proper control. Public expenditures were moderate, and were regulated as honest, sensible men manage their own. There had been no perilous development of municipal credits, and there was very little magnificent public spirit supported by some other person's money. RELIGIOUS HISTORY SINCE 1834. With the second half-century also began a period of pros perity general among the Protestant churches, and that, for perhaps the ensuing thirty years, was, with most of them, their time of greatest success. In the Roman Catholic Church there has been uninterrupted growth to the present time. At first this communion was small ; now it numbers possibly a third of the population. Among the Protestants attendance at first was general ; now it seems true that hardly two-thirds of them"], [71, "39 RELIGIOUS HISTORY SINCE 1834. help to support any church in the town, while the Catholics almost unanimously attend their own service, so that their societies have increased from one to three. Congregationalism,1 that, as already shown, had been almost the sole denomination in the town until about 1810, and that soon afterwards became divided, was still the most prominent for some time after 1834. Through perhaps twenty years from 1840 it was difficult to hire a good pew in either of its three meeting-houses,2 so well filled were they (as was probably true of others). An ideal of the relation of pastor and people could hardly be more fully realized than it was in the ministry of Dr. Budington (1840-54) in the First Church. With the enthusiasm of a young man and of his own nature, as well as with the devotion of a Christian, he labored for it, while the people \u2014 the town, indeed \u2014 held him in affectionate regard; nor could the love of Christians for their church be more touch ingly and earnestly shown than was the love of some of the old members for what they called \" the old church,\" that they or theirs had sustained through many trials. Since 1833, it may be added, the Trinitarians have built three meeting houses,2 while the Unitarians have (since 1818) built one house (supplemented, 1856-79, by the Harvard Chapel). All the Protestant societies that have existed in or during the period have been active, but their number has not in creased. Each of them now has a place of worship 2 that is better, or is in better condition, than ever, and there are few debts, yet in all of them there is a feeling of changed circum stances. Some serious questions are suggested in regard to the future, and it may be asked how far great freedom of 1 Of Unitarian, a full account is given in its History (Bib., p. 87) ; of Trinita rian, a condensed account of the First Church on the following pages, and of the Winthrop Church in its Memorial (p. 273, this book). The latter states (p. 9) that its contributions for benevolent objects (besides support of that church) was in fifty years, $155,488. To this should be added the large gifts of two members, \u2014 Wm. Carlton, to Carlton College, Minnesota, and Thos. Doane to Doane College, Nebraska. In the First Church parishioners, Walter Hastings (over twenty years) bequeathed a large sum to Harvard College, and Jas. Hunnewell (nearly forty years) was one of the largest private contributors to Oahu College. 2 See pages 53 to 59 hereafter, for descriptions."], [72, "40 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. thought and action, and, with many persons, a growing lack of a sense of duty or responsibility, are compatible with efficiency and durability. Remarkable success has been obtained by a church in which there are few rich persons, and a great many who are not, but where every one is taught and held to the personal obligation to do something, even if little. It may also be asked, what is likely to be the final result of abandon ment of an old order of service in which worship forms a great part, and where this is actively and frequently shared by the congregation, and the substitution of an order in which, as is not unknown, there is a tendency in the meeting-house to have a lecture at one end, a concert at the other, and between them a critical audience. If briefly summed up, it may be said that within this period the Congregationalists have hardly held their own; that the Baptists and Universalists have done better ; the Methodists have largely gained ; the Episcopalians, as a body, come into being and not heavily increased ; and the Catholic's have grown to a remarkable extent. On April 16, 1882, the Sunday after Easter, and a pleasant day, a count was made of the attendance at the churches in Boston (Daily Adv., 18th) showing that the result in Charles town was that there were at the First Church, 110 + 88 = 198 ; Winthrop, 380 -f- 270 = 650 (848 Trinitarian) ; Unitarian, 163 ; St. John's, 400 4- 100 = 500 ; Monument Square, 250 + 775 = 1,025; Trinity, 320 + 601 = 921 (1,946 Methodist); Univer salist, 337 + 310 = 647 ; First Baptist, 211 (a. m.) ; B. H. do., 400 (p. M.) All except the last two, and the Unitarian, where there is one service, are for the usual two services, making a total of 4,715 ; that with all the Baptists would probably be 5,000. At the Roman Catholic services there were at St. Francis's, 1,478 + 341 = 1819, and St. Mary's, 950 + 502 = 1,452, or in all, 3,271, \u2014 about forty per cent of all the attendance. At a later date (1885 ?) an examination of the town was made to a considerable, yet not the fullest, extent, by which it was found that among Protestants there were 1,311 families not in churches but expressing some preference for denomina-"], [73, "41 RELIGIOUS HISTORY SINCE 1834. tions, and 490 not wishing to attend church. On Sunday, May 1, 1887, a pleasant day, a count (for Dr. Towle, Prest. Y. M. C. A.) was made of the attendance at the morning services. At the First Church there were 126 ; Winthrop, 480 (606 Trinitarians) ; Unitarian, 170 ; First Baptist, 290 ; B. H. Bap tist, 200 (490 Baptists) ; Trinity, 270 ; Union, 130 (400 Meth odists) ; Universalist, 215 ; St. John's, 219. At the First Church, and at St. John's, the second service would add con siderable numbers to these figures, and others would in the same way be increased. The total for the morning is 2,100, and for the day might possibly be 3,500 Protestants (in a population of about 38,000), or thirty-five per cent less than five years before (out of about 34,000). At the same time 400 families attended to some extent the services at the Young Men's Christian Association, but contributed little to the ex penses. It is said that very few of the families reported (1885 ?) as non-attendants were gathered into the churches, where it seems as if only about one quarter of the Protestant adult population was found, although many others were repre sented by children in the Sunday Schools. Only a moderate percentage of the young men went to church ; indeed, the average attendance of adults at any one ordinary service is now less, it is said, than the number of enrolled communicants. Evidently there is cause enough for serious thought and action. It is noticeable that attendance at the services on Easter and Christmas has largely increased at the Episcopal Church, while that on Fast and Thanksgiving, the two Congregational special days, has so much declined that only one service is held for all the other Protestant churches. It is, however, a very good arrangement, for all the separated congregations and clergy act in neighborly union. In weekly meetings there are some times appeals through a lower range of attractions, and it seems as if a more general reliance might be had on those of beauty, dignity, and solemnity.

State, the Democrats ruled the town. Another element, how ever, began to appear here, as it did elsewhere, eventually to control the country', and even change the politics of Charles town. In 1851, R. C. Winthrop had 995 votes ; Geo. S. Bout well, 932 ; John G. Palfrey, 176 ; others, 2 ; (total, 2,105). In 1855, H. J. Gardner had 1,127 ; E. D. Beach, 759 ; J. Rock well, 311 ; S. H. Walley, 276 ; (total, 2,473.) In the next four presidential elections, including the last sepa rate vote by Charlestown, great changes in political thought, as well as in numbers, appeared. A great many civilians were employed in the Navy Yard, and whatever political help was to be got that way was not apt to be neglected by the Demo crats, who held the national administration until after the election in 1860. A similar course, it is very likely, affected the Republican vote during the war, and in a greater degree, for there was a far larger force in government employ. A much stronger reason, however, existed in the immense popu lar movement by which the latter party was supported. It will be noticed that Charlestown was Republican notwithstand ing any influence of the existing administration, in 1860, and continued so for years after the end of the war. For some time before that eventful period, all phases of political feeling were actively shown, from marked subserviency to the parti sans of slavery to open help in trying to stop its extension, \u2014 from \" copperheadism \" (only a mere trace of it) to a generous patriotism and enthusiasm worthy of Bunker Hill, felt by all sorts of people. In 1842, a notable municipal change occurred ; a portion of the territory of the town was annexed to West Cambridge, and a larger part incorporated (March 3) as the town of Somerville, leaving the area of this town one of the smallest in the State. Feb. 22, 1847, a city form of government was established;1 The votes for electors were about as follows: \u2014 1860, Republican, 1,785 ; others, 1,528 ; total, 3,313. 1864, do. 2,765; do. 1,198; do. 3,963. 1868, do. 2,642 ; Democratic, 1,784 ; do. 4,426. 1872, do. 3,014 ; do. 1,635 ; do. 4,649. 1 The vote on accepting a City Charter was, \u2014yes, 1,127 ; no, 868 ; majority in favor, 259."], [76, "44 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Hon. Geo. W. Warren was chosen mayor,1 and various changes in schoolhouses and other things ensued. Among many sub stantial citizens there was, in a few years, a belief that the place was too small for a separate municipality, and that its interests would be promoted by annexation to Boston.2 An Act of the Legislature to that effect was passed (April 29, 1854) and accepted (C, Oct. 2) by the voters of both cities, but rendered inoperative, it was said, through a failure (in C.) to certify returns. The City record (of C.) is suggestive ; the figures of the vote, given below, are from the Daily Advertiser, and show the deep interest in the subject, as 2,529 voters (there were 2,722 in 1851) gave their opinion. The plan de feated had been considered over twenty years before, and, after intermittent effort, was actively revived about as long after wards. Another Act was passed (May 14, 1873), duly voted on (Oct. 7), and annexation effected (Jan. 1, 1874). A score of pamphlets on the subject, described in the Bibliography, fully set forth reasons for and against the measure, and furnish some of the liveliest political writing about the Town. That the reasons were thought to be good and sufficient is shown by the votes at the two dates, said to be the only times when op portunity was given for such an expression of opinion. That there was strong opposition appears in the Valedictory Ad dress of the last Mayor, who declared that, on the day of voting, \" the people of this ancient and historic municipality virtually said we are not capable of governing ourselves, and bowed to the God of Mammon, and yielded up, with their in dependence forever, that trust which was bequeathed to them to transmit to posterity.\" The number of municipal offices has been much reduced, cases before the courts are tried in Suffolk, the bridges are improved, and a few other changes 1 The Mayors have been the Honorables Geo.

Since annexation, changes have naturally followed in what might be called the individuality of the place, noticeable in society as well as in local politics. For the exercise of the latter a considerable number of offices remain, but they differ in influence as merged among the many of a large corporation, instead of being far greater means of control in a body, even if that is comparatively small. Of one form of change, hardly political, indeed, but public, there is evidence afforded by ex amination of the Auditors' Reports of Boston, where it appears that the valuation (1874, p. 288) of Real Estate in Charles town was $26,016,100 in 1873, and in 1886 (Rep. '87) it was $23,075,700, or $2,940,400 less; and that Personal (same dates) declined from $9,273,528, to $5,682,000 (38| %), or a total decline of $6,531,928 (about 18J %). In 1873, to a population estimated by the assessors (Rep. '74, p. 7) the av erage was $1101 + per head, and by the census of 1885, with the valuation of 1886, it was $730 + (about 33^ % less). BUSINESS SINCE 1834. At the beginning of the second half-century there was a fair amount of local business, but not much on any large scale. Many persons, as has since been the case, lived in the town and had various occupations in Boston. Farmers and traders came with their produce to the Square, and made it the live liest place of traffic. There were sufficient banking facilities, and the local shops had relatively a greater importance than at present. With the introduction of railroads in the State, a fresh development occurred here, as elsewhere. The line to Lowell, opened in 1835, extended through what was then the westerly part of the town, but a mile or more distant from its frontage on deep water. To connect the two, the Charlestown Branch Railroad Co. was incorporated (April 9, 1836), and built from Swett's wharf to a junction not much over a mile distant, near the McLean Asylum, the chief work on it being a wooden bridge in that direction from Prison Point. Short as"], [78, "46 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. was the line, it was not opened until the latter part of 1838, the national financial crisis having a severe effect. Supple mentary to this road was the Charlestown Wharf Co. (inc. Mch. 31, 1836), that was authorized to hold wharf and other property from the Navy Yard to the State Prison, and did hold a great deal within these limits. Six years later the Fitchburg Railroad Co. was incorporated (Mch. 3, 1842), and acquired both the Branch road and much of the land of the other com pany. In the two last mentioned there was a considerable local interest, some of which was transferred to their far larger successor, that began a remarkable development at the lower end of the town, by which, in the course of forty years, a station on a side-track was changed to an important railway terminus. The Wharf Co. had a paid up capital of $293,550, the Branch Co. less (although more was authorized), and both had a moderate business, no great part of which was far reach ing. The Fitchburg Co. at once largely increased it. A line was opened to Fresh Pond, and ice, a staple product of New England, was brought in great quantities to the wharves, and shipped to southern ports and abroad. Communication was speedily established with a wide interior country, so that public convenience required (1847) that the terminal station for pas sengers should be moved from the northern end of Warren Bridge, where one of brick had been built, to the southern end, in Boston, and at a large cost this change was effected (1847 48). In Charlestown, additions to the territory were made, from time to time, by purchase and by covering flats or the river, the most important of these operations being in connec tion with the estate of the Hoosac Tunnel Dock and Elevator Co. (inc. April 29, 1879), which was at length bought (1887), and exceptionally good terminal facilities at deep sea water secured, including enormous sheds and an immense grain ele vator. A large area between the river, Chelsea Street, and the Square is also to be added. In 1873, the Eastern Railroad Co. bought an extensive tract covering flats, much of the old mill-pond, and a strip on the peninsula from the Prison to near the Square, and on the last built a very extensive station for merchandise. Almost simul-"], [79, "47 BUSINESS SINCE 1834. taneously the Lowell Railroad Co. (1870) bought for freight ing business another large tract at the Point, beyond the Navy Yard and along Mystic River, to which its tracks were ex tended. It succeeded to the Mystic River road, incorporated in 1853, but long delayed in development. Thus three impor tant companies came to hold a great deal of the old water front age of the town, that thus became the seashore terminus of very large traffic extending through northern and central New Eng land, to the maritime British Provinces, Canada, the Northwest ern States of the Union, and even as far as California, while daily to all these distant parts go passengers over Charlestown ground. Curious processions of pungs from the upper coun try long ago ceased to come down Main Street in the winter, as also did the canal boats to Mill Street in the summer ; loads of wood, hay, and produce are seen no more grouped in the Square ; clumsy and ponderous ice-wagons that wore the soft roads badly, the Lowell stage, and other creations familiar in 1834, have not been known to the younger people, but there is a vastly greater traffic, such as would have amazed the men then, and that gives far more employment and income, and, in its way, is quite as picturesque. Another form of railroad at a later date became known in the larger towns of the country, and, as was apt to be the case with inventions, had a representation in Charlestown. With the increase of population the transportation of passengers through the streets required means very different from those previously used. As early as 1826, A. Studley established a line of \" hourlies \" from the Neck to Brattle Street, in Boston ; more business soon made the name inapplicable, for a vehicle was wanted every half, then quarter, of an hour, then oftener, and the conveyance for all became, as its newer name has descriptively styled it, an omnibus. No less than three lines at one time made the streets lively. At length the Middlesex Horse Railroad Co. was incorporated (1854), tracks were laid to Somerville, Medford, and Maiden, all (1887) made parts of the West End Co. A line to Chelsea (afterwards much ex tended) was also incorporated (1854). The different routes traverse the town and furnish ample accommodation."], [80, "48 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. While the town has not been what is called a manufacturing place, several companies have been formed, and have done business in various departments. The Milk Row Bleachery when incorporated (1838) was on Charlestown ground, but since 1842 on that of Somerville, where it has grown a great deal. Other incorporations followed, \u2014 of a Lead Co. (1850), and of the Union Sugar Refinery, the building of which be came part of the freight station of the Eastern R. R. (1873). At least four companies have, since 1854, been engaged in developing business along the bank of Mystic River. The Howard Manufacturing Co. (1885) has a massive brick build ing six stories high (Medford St.), with valuable machinery, and employs 200 persons in making excellent razor-straps, tooth brushes, and elastics. Of other kinds of trade long known in the town, brickmaking ceased at the loss of the requisite ground in 1842; private shipbuilding, begun at Ten Hills (1631), ended about 1850 ; leather-making has almost disappeared ; brewing, and on a large scale, has continued at the Neck, and distilling almost on the very site, near the old town dock, where it was prac tised long before the Revolution. Furniture, doors and finish, and pottery in coarse articles, have been made to quite a large extent, while innkeeping, always known and active here since the sign of the \" Three Cranes \" was displayed, has been de veloped almost on a scale like that shown by the railroads ; for directly beside the spot where stood the Puritan ordinary, opens the great front door of the Waverley House, a building large enough to lodge, on a pinch, the whole colony of 1630. A great hotel is one of the prominent evidences of the growth of an American town, and for this example we are indebted to Moses A. Dow, long a resident (Plan II. 44 A). He selected a site on the Square, the history of which is given on page 124. Inns had long been on or close by the spot, but he surpassed them so that comparison is impossible. His hotel, four and five stories high, built of red brick with brown stone trimmings (except a central block covered with brown mastic), and having a frontage nearly 500 feet long, was inaugurated by one of the most notable dinners ever given in the town, Nov. 21, 1867,"], [81, "BUSINESS SINCE 1834. 49 when, in the dining-room (80 X 50 ft.), an unusual represen tation of Charlestown people assembled to do honor to him and his achievement. In time more Banks had become wanted ; accordingly, in 1854, the Monument1 was incorporated. Its capital is $150, 000, its surplus is more than that amount, and its stock com mands one of the highest prices given for any bank-stock in Boston, \u2014 a fact that tells its history. Ten days later, the Five Cent Savings Bank2 was incorporated. An account of its building and of its success is given elsewhere (p. 145). More and better light at night was also wanted by some, and in 1846 the Charlestown Gas Co.3 was incorporated. There was for a while no ardent desire to subscribe to the stock, so that the company was not organized for active operations until May 24, 1851, when the capital was $50,000. This was in creased (Feb. 6, 1854) to $81,000, and as the works were enlarged was from time to time made more, until the final amount, $500,000 was reached (1873), making it the largest manufacturing establishment ever in the town. The business has been carefully and economically conducted by a conserva tive, yet progressive management, recognizing in due time changes and improvements, so that in Sep., 1886, the steam boilers of the company were supplying power for making sim ultaneously, as then nowhere else in the State, coal and water gas, and electric light. Within a small area the combination was proved to be practicable and efficient. Supplying water, while done under direction of the City gov ernment, and hence a municipal work, may, however, be con sidered in one way a corporate work, and be mentioned in this chapter. After discussion incident to the undertaking, a Legis lative Act was passed (1861) that resulted in the Mystic Water Works.* Reports were made (1861-62), including one by Pro- 1 The Presidents have been, Peter Hubbell (1854-71), and Jas.

On Nov. 29, 1863, the introduc tion of water was celebrated, with a procession, speeches, a din ner in the old Town Hall, and illuminations. By the Reports, that are full and interesting, it appears that the cost of the works (Feb. 28, 1865), was $746,965.44 ; their length, to the Neck, 5.62 miles ; the water-level of the reservoir, 147 feet above high water ; the extent of service pipes, 18 miles ; and the total number of customers, 2,020. Eight years later (1873) there were 13,946, and the construction account had risen to $1,461,259.41. In 1886, these numbers had increased to 16,110, and $1,657,458.97. While there are no large build ings, and nothing of the grand Roman style of masonry in the works, the earthen reservoir (560 x 350 ft.) on its high isolated site is quite imposing, and from its banks there is a wide and varied view that is full of scenic and historic interest. Business in Charlestown to the present day may be said to have its great monument in the huge Hoosac Elevator, stand ing close to the sites of the old battery and town dock. Where the snug little Provincial trade once centred, on the edge of a wilderness, rises this building (167 x 80), 135 feet high, gray slated, plain yet almost grand, receiving grain from a distant and then hardly known interior, to distribute it through great ocean steamers to lands even farther away, and help feed the people where the fathers of the founders once tilled the fields. PLACES OF PUBLIC WORSHIP. Until recent years, here, as has been the case in our older towns, these have been built chiefly according to the examples set by the early inhabitants, \u2014 that is, on what might be called an indigenous plan, with designs affected by the styles current in England. When the settlers came their first labor was, naturally, to provide shelter for their families, and then a place for public worship. In Charlestown, this place was combined with the residence of the Governor, but soon afterwards a"], [83, "PLACES OF PUBLIC WORSHIP. 51 separate building for the purpose was erected. Limited means and available material had a large influence in shaping the building here, as they had elsewhere. A considerable space was to be enclosed at a necessarily moderate cost. Wood was almost the one possible material. The builders had not only separated from the Church of England and its usages, but they had done so when that church itself had abandoned the archi tectural forms that had been used for ages, and had adopted a style more or less Italian. Hence it is not strange that the colonists attempted neither nave, chancel, nor arcades, but built a square wooden box, with fully enough windows, relieved by a few mouldings and details similar to those used at the time in the mother country, but yet a house capable of hold ing all the people expected, and of giving them a full view of the pulpit. The colonial or provincial period of New England corresponded with the period in Old England when ecclesias tical art was, on the whole, the least precious for the past eight centuries ; and it would be unreasonable to suppose that the peo ple here, with their limited means, and deriving their scanty ideas of art, or their feeling for it, from a home where it was by no means at its best, would create notable material monu ments of faith. In justice to them, furthermore, it should be observed that even to their simple buildings they not infre quently gave quaintness or picturesqueness. They had cast adrift from an historical sequence in other things, and they ceased to cherish the form of home for wor ship used in a varying way since the days of Constantine. They built, not a church of the long-recognized character, but a hall, and this, with a few exceptions, became, and continued to our time, the distinguishing shape of the New England meeting-house. Insubstantial in structure, as was apt to be the case, the third place of worship since the \" Great House \" was left, was built in 1716, on the Square, but exactly where is now hardly to be determined with absolute precision. It is said to have been a framed building, 72 by 52 feet, and 34 feet (or three stories ?) high, and had a steeple. This was the meeting house burned June 17, 1775, valued (p. 174) at \u00a33,000."], [84, "52 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. There appears no reason to suppose that it differed much from the old meeting-houses in several neighboring towns, that had a steeple at one end, for, if we can infer from dimensions, and judge from a few imperfect views, it was not built like the house of the First Church, Boston, \u2014 nearly a square, with a roof sloping four ways, and bearing in the middle a belfry with a little attenuated spire. In 1783, on the general rebuilding of the town, its meeting house was erected on the top of the Town Hill (Plan I.), from which a good deal of earth had been removed the year before, thus reducing its height. The grant of the land has already been quoted (p. 17), and some particulars about the house have been given. It was of wood, and was 72 by 52 feet ex ternally, besides a porch, and a tower, 22^- by 20 feet, that fronted Henley Street. Some of the original plans further show that it had two rows of round-topped windows on the four sides, and a gallery around three sides of the interior. An enlargement became necessary in 1804, adding 15 feet on each side, making the building, if the rearrangement of the pews and the way they faced is the basis of description, 82 feet wide and 72 feet long according to the plan, or 84 by 74 feet as measured (J. H.). The steeple, according to a plan reported at a parish meeting June 8, 1803, was 193 feet high. It, like the interior finish at that time, was designed by Charles Bulfinch. Mr. Frothingham (Hist. C, 161) gives a litho graphic general view of the exterior. Reproductions from the original plan of the steeple, from an elevation of the side of the interior, and from plans of the pews, with names, before the alteration, are here given.1 It was by far the most impor tant building in the town, and its erection so soon after the severe trials of the war was strong evidence of enterprise and devotion. Of special gifts, there was from Hon. Thomas Rus sell a clock that still bears his name and keeps time well in its place on the front of the existing gallery ; a larger one is still doing good service in the present brick tower; and \"Champion, Dickason, & Burgis, merchants of London, presented a bell \" 1 These plans, and some other papers, saved by the late James Hunnewell, ap pear to be about the only early Parish relics of the sort extant."], [85, "o#plan ef T<*le etf/ceral?cricr of the 'meeting t/ouse in the ffsst Parish in the Toiati of Cftarr'estoiitnz rcnorled OTZ& prescnlsQ by 0> \u25a0mmitivc..to,the par/J-fl At 1-heir meeting eJune #*** //OJ."], [86, ""], [87, "xSedtiarvof^he <Side."], [88, ""], [89, "Charlestown Meet* no-House, I8Q4 P\u00abw\u00bb on The Floor."], [90, ""], [91, "CHARLESTOWN MEETINft-HouaE,l804-.

After a curious history,1 it was bought from the Town by the late James Hun newell,and the Parish has the use of it under certain wise and proper conditions. A chapel built by the Church, \" in the Garden of the par sonage, by leave of the pastor\" (Plan II.), was opened for services Feb. 19, 1809. It was a wooden building, 26 X 21 feet, and \" 10| feet high in the clear,\" costing about $400, raised by subscription, \u2014 $411 from 65 persons, including $35.50 from several ladies not thus counted. Extensive repairs were at length needed, and it was decided to rebuild the meeting-house of brick. The walls of the pres ent edifice, except those of the tower, angle-porches, and chan cel, were erected closely on the old site (see Plan III.), and the new house was dedicated July 3, 1834. Rev. Dr. Fay, June 23, 1833, preached, from Psalm xliv., 1-3, the last sermon in the old house, giving an account of the settlement of the town, and of the beginning of the church there in 1630. So few exact details remain about the houses of the First Church be fore the Revolution, that it seems proper to set down here a rather full account of those subsequently built. On taking down the old house, \" some of the timber, joist, and boards of the oldest part were found to be perfectly sound and good ; \" but parts were decayed, and some of the wood was \" little other than powder post, particularly in the tower, where it was worse than in the body of the house.\" All the \" old foundation and underpinning stone were used in the new cellar wall, . . . also all the large timber and part of the joist in the floor and side-galleries of the new house ; the rough board ing of the lower floor, and all the furring of boards and planks on the new walls are from the old house\" (as well as the heavy posts inside the existing piers of the arcade). In addition to the old materials, there were bought of new, 86,788 ft. of boards and plank, 10,798 ft. of joist, 4,490 ft. of ranging tim- 1 Including this, the writer printed, in 1868, an article refuting a charge made against \"the Charlestown people\" (Hist. Gen. Keg. xxii., 390) that they stole a church bell, which an aged man, who told the story, had seen. It is fully shown that he never could have seen such a bell, and the people were not what he stated."], [94, "54 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. ber and 45 tons of ton timber, together with 315,000 bricks, \" nearly all of which were made in Charlestown,\" cellar stones from Cape Ann, and ashlar stones (still seen in the basement) from Quincy. These particulars are from the record kept by James Hunnewell, secretary and treasurer of the building committee, who, it should be added, gave very important help in carrying the Parish and ancient Church safely through a trying period. The edifice, dedicated July 3, 1834, was of the old hall plan, but it was finished in the style of the time. Internally the walls were covered with yellow wash ; the flat ceiling was plain and white, and had a large stucco centre-piece ; the pulpit, of mahogany, was semi-circular and high ; the facings of the galleries, on three sides, were panelled ; and two huge Doric pillars in front of the organ supported the inner part of the belfry. Underneath the hall were two \" vestries,\" or lecture rooms, and a sort of cellar. Externally there was a granite basement from which rose walls of hard brick marked by pilasters that were capped, and that bore a simple entablature. The slated roof remains, but an open cupola of a base and eight Ionic pillars bearing a dome and containing the bell, was removed in 1852. Broad wooden steps led up to a platform and three doors in the front (towards the Square).1 Rev. W. I. Budington was ordained April 22, 1840. He, as he told the writer near the close of his life, came determined with all his young enthusiasm \u2014 that never left him \u2014 to de vote himself to the old church. He wrote its history, and on his return from a tour in Europe, for which leave and some thing more were given, advocated a remodelling and some con formity to Christian art. A costly but commonplace design, furnished by one then in fashion, was happily discarded, and Alexander R. Esty, a man of ideas and then young, was em ployed. His design, somewhat in Norman forms, was adopted. The only tower in the town was built, with an unusually pic turesque belfry story ; round heads were given the windows ; a chancel northward was added ; a fine arcade of five arches 1 No exact view is known to the writer. A wood-cut (Hist, of C, p. 133) is imperfect in details, but the gensral form is shown."], [95, "PLACES OF PUBLIC WORSHIP. 55 supporting a groined ceiling, and three arches before the chan cel, were constructed inside ; and new pews, organ, and pulpit were added. Jan. 6, 1853, the new, and existing, house was dedicated. In 1868 Miss Charlotte Harris gave a chime of sixteen bells, commemorative of her ancestors and family, Devens and Harris, who were long connected with the Church and Parish, as some of her relatives have been to the present time. In 1870, repairs and renewals becoming needed, they were quite extensively made, and Oct. 2d the house was reopened. By vote of the Parish, the matter of coloring was left with the writer, and polychrome was used, not to the extent he might wish, but to an extent then novel in this region, and according to available funds ; for the Parish, suiting his advice for many years, considered a file of bills paid a better offering to the Lord than a nice little list of notes payable. If the design of the interior, good as it is, must perforce be carried out in the vicious American fashion of lath and plaster, there is not much bad art in the simple, expressive coloring. No rubbish of sham panels, pilasters, and scrolls, dishonors the walls, and instead of a sham Bible or cross daubed back of the pulpit, as some folks like, there is, in bright gold, the emblem of heavenly glory, a great monogram of the name before which every knee shall bow, expressed in letters such as the Apostles used in their writing, and the early confessors put on the tombs of the martyrs. In the basement there are neatly finished lecture and com mittee rooms ; the exterior of the building is painted dark brown ; and the whole (1887) was never in better order. A good iron fence encloses the premises, that are wholly inso lated, and contain grass-ground, together with some trees and shrubs, \u2014 the only example in town of an English church-green. May 12, 1801, the Baptists dedicated their house, the second in the town, a wooden one, 75 by 50 feet, with a two-storied cupola at the west end, placed at the head of Salem Street on land given by 0. Holden. A considerable number of members withdrew in 1809, but kept the house, and, in 1810, the older body built a brick house, 60 by 46 feet, \" and only about 16"], [96, "56 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. feet in height,\" on Austin Street. This building was enlarged in 1830, and in 1843 was replaced by a new one of brick, built nearly on the same site but fronting Lawrence Street. Its exterior is covered with brown mastic, and there is a tall wooden steeple without a tower. Internally, it has been re modelled, and now something of the Basilica form and style appears, without side galleries and with two rows of pillars bearing a low, arched ceiling. The edifice is bounded on three sides by streets, and at the rear by houses. In 1810, says Dr. Bartlett, \" A Universal meeting-house, 62 feet long, 62 feet wide, and 34 feet high, was built with brick. It is commodious and handsomely finished.\" Feb. 27th of the next year, the \" First Universalist Society \" was incorporated. It was the third prominent Religious Society in the town, and was destined to become one of the most important of its de nomination. Its original house, of the old hall form, redeco rated on the inside, painted a pale olive color on the outside, and surmounted by a large and high square belfry at the west erly end, is still its place of worship, standing detached on the Society's ground near Thompson Square (Plan IV.). The Unitarian, or Second Congregational Society, incorpo rated Feb. 9, 1816, has been called the Harvard Church since 1837. Its house, built of brick, dedicated Feb. 10, 1819, still in good order, measures 71 by 67 feet on the inside, and has in front a square tower bearing a handsome steeple of wood. Except in the latter, that follows the school of Wren \u2014 the favorite when it was designed \u2014 and that has two stories with Corinthian and Composite pillars and entablatures surmounted by the spire, the exterior is plain and without architectural features. The interior shows the hall plan, with galleries on three sides, a flat ceiling with an elaborate centre-piece of stucco, and two rows of square-headed windows. While in it there is nothing ecclesiastical, as the word has meant for over a dozen centuries, this interior, although changed (1859) still gives some valuable evidence of the taste and habits of the time when it was built. The extensive alterations, not all of which were improvements, that were made, included new pews, and a pulpit in a recess within a plain and not beautiful addition made to"], [97, "PLACES OF PUBLIC WORSHIP. 57 the northerly end of the house. Mural commemorative in scriptions and monuments are very scarce in the town, but of them there are in this meeting-house two that honor those who erected them, as well as Rev. Dr. Walker and Rev. Thos. Pren tiss, to whose memory they were raised. The former, placed at the side of the pulpit towards Wood Street, and dedicated Jan. 14, 1883, is a work of considerable size and elaboration, Renaissance in style, showing a portrait bust beneath an arch, flanked by inscriptions. Unlike six out of the nine Protestant places of worship here, this house has no rooms beneath it, but in place of them it has a cellar used during many years for storage and business, and making it the only religious edifice used for such purposes. A separate building for lectures and minor meetings, the Boylston Chapel, stands in a court at some distance (Plan IV.). The Baptists' meeting-house of 1801, sold (for $1,850) by order of Court (1815), was used for a short time (1817-19) by the Unitarian congregation, and subsequently, for many years, by the Methodist society. Afterwards it was used as an armory, and a public hall, until 1882, when it was demol- ished to make way for \" The Salem,\" a large, brick, apartment house, in picturesque style, belonging to Thos. Doane. At least four places of worship besides these already mentioned have also been occupied by the Baptists. Mr. Holden, the writer is told, maintained a very small chapel that stood nearly opposite the head of Wood Street, and between 1809 and 1823, Rev. W. Balfour ministered to a congregation with some pecu- liarities of belief. Both of these societies worshipped in pri- vate buildings (Dr. B.). In 1844, the High Street Baptist Church was formed, and March 5, 1846, dedicated its house, opposite the end of Elm Street. It was a plain wooden build- ing, afterwards enlarged by the Trinity Methodist society, to which it passed, and was burned on Sunday morning, Feb. 10, 1867. Meanwhile a wooden house had been built for a congre- gation in Elm Street, and another, with a steeple, at the Neck, near the line of the Eastern railroad. Both of these latter have disappeared. January 14, 1850, the Bethesda Baptist Church was organized, called since 1851 the Bunker Hill"], [98, "58 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Baptist, which built (1851) a plain wooden house that was remodelled (1885) and made much more elaborate, in the style sometimes called \" Queen Anne.\" This house has a steeple westward, and is bounded on two sides by streets and on the other two by dwellings. The Methodists, when in the house mentioned above, were divided, and another was built (1848) for a second society, on the corner of High Street and Monument Square. It is a neat, simple, building of brick, the facings of which are pressed, relieved by stone trimmings, and is surmounted by a small cupola. In 1866, the house was remodelled, and enlarged. In 1867, the Trinity Methodist Society set an example that, certainly in one matter, ought to be much oftener followed. Their house burned Feb. 10th was insubstantial, combustible, and, if the truth can be spoken, it was also very ugly. On rebuilding, S. J. F. Thayer, architect, furnished designs, and a house was built not merely of brick in the customary way, but with hollow walls, on which the inside plaster finish was laid. The roof, supported by slender pillars and showing its frame, had no dangerous garret ; partitions in the basement were filled solid ; indeed a nearer approach was made to un inflammable construction than in any other public building ever in the town, while, at the same time, one of the largest Protestant churches then in the State was made convenient and attractive by simple forms of recent eclectic Pointed style. On a moonlight night the view of the front from the northeast ward, when the tower, spire, and central gable, are seen at an angle, shows, perhaps, the prettiest bit of grouping now in the town. The Congregationalists once more divided after 1816. In 1834 the Winthrop Church was formed, and for it, on Union Street, was built a brick house somewhat like that of the First Church, but plainer, \u2014 indeed, to Puritan austerity. In 1847 land was bought on Green Street (Plan IV.), and March 4, 1849, a new house there was dedicated. It is of brick, with a buttressed tower bearing a wooden steeple at the N. W. corner. The extreme outside measure is about 100 by 70 feet, and all parts are painted a dark brown color. There"], [99, ""], [100, ""], [101, "59 PLACES OF PUBLIC WORSHIP. are lecture and other rooms in the basement, on the floor above which are sittings for a large congregation, such as has always been gathered here. The old native hall form, with the galleries on three sides appears, but, like the exterior, de signed in the style of the earlier period of the Gothic Revival, an arched ceiling, a little more acute than the usual Tudor arch, being the chief feature. In the decoration, polychrome to a moderate extent was introduced in 1880, and in a recess behind the pulpit is a high, black walnut reredos of unusual elegance. There are no grounds attached to the edifice. The Episcopalians of the town, formally gathered Jan., 1840, at first held services in the Town Hall. In 1841 they built and dedicated St. John's Church, a brick edifice with a front of dark granite ashlar, having a low, square tower, standing at the corner of Richmond Street and Bow (now Devens) Street. Here also the taste of the earlier period of the Gothic Revival was shown in a building of the old hall form. A picturesque wooden chapel was erected (1873, Ware and Van Brunt archi tects), on adjoining land bought by the Parish, aud (1877, A. C. Martin, architect) extensive alterations and improvements were made inside the church. There the fittings are neat, and recently added chancel furniture is good and appropriate. Conspicuous behind the altar is the only memorial window of stained glass in the town, placed there in memory of Peter Hubbell, for many years the efficient senior warden, who died in January, 1871. In aspect and condition this church was never better than at present. Of the Roman communion there were few persons in the town until about half a century after the rebuilding, but sub sequently the number has increased until it has become large. Their first church, on Richmond Street, was dedicated to St. Mary in May, 1829. Notwithstanding the conservative regard for established forms characteristic of the great organization represented here, the old local hall, with its galleries on three sides, was built, partly for the same reasons of wants and means that affected the early settlers. St. Mary's is a plain brick building, 45 by 133 feet (a considerable addition to the original length having been made a few years ago), with two light, open"], [102, "60 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. cupolas on brick bases at the front, but with no architectural features. The interior shows scrolls and patterns in fresco on the walls and ceiling, a new altar, and several paintings. This church becoming utterly insufficient in size for a rapidly in creasing congregation, another was erected on the summit of Bunker Hill, on the site of the British redoubt, and beside the Catholic burial-ground. Walls, 74 by 150 feet, of blue stone with granite trimmings, and a spire 181 feet high, rising from a gable at the front, form a substantial edifice that is conspicu ously seen for a great distance. Internally, it shows a nave with slender pillars, lateral galleries, and a chancel, the light coming through two rows of low-pointed windows at the sides. June 17, 1862, it was dedicated to St. Francis cle Sales, who was canonized in 1665. He was \" of a noble family of Savoy,\" and (1602-22) a distinguished bishop of Geneva. It is nota ble that two of the remaining four hills of the peninsula are closely associated with men of that one distant city, \u2014 John Calvin, who died in 1564, with the First Church, on Town Hill, and this great exemplar of the ancient ritual with the actual Bunker Hill. In 1887, still larger numbers of attendants made it necessary to build two more churches. At the junc tion of Corey and Vine streets, the corner stone of one was laid (July 31) dedicated to St. Catharine of Sienna. It is of brick, with freestone trimmings, in modified Romanesque style, and measures outside 156 X 98 feet, and has a tower with a short spire 112 feet high. The other, or new St. Mary's, a massive and expensive edifice, at the corner of Warren and Winthrop streets, will be 153| x 81 feet, and also be of brick, but a large amount of granite will be used. There will be a tower, ultimately crowned by a spire 180 feet high. The style will be a modern form of Pointed. Note. \u2014 Of Christian Art, as known to the world for fifteen centuries, it is interesting to review what this prosperous New England town has at the end of two and a half centuries. The feeling of the founders has prevailed throughout, for while houses are commodious, and are now, as they were not in early days, comfortable or even luxurious, there is very little real Art. The First Church has the one interior designed on eccle siastical lines, hut the execution is American, in lath and plaster. It has,"], [103, "61 INSTITUTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE. also, the first mural monument in the town raised since the Revolution, a large slab commemorative of the ministers before that period, prepared at the desire, and by the care, of the Rev. Dr. Budington. The Harvard church has the one sculptured monument of this kind (p. 57). St. John's has the one memorial window of stained glass, besides good altar furniture (p. 59) ; and the Winthrop has an elegant reredos of tracery in Pointed style, executed in black walnut. Altar paintings, not numerous on the European scale, are found in the Catholic churches. Of architectural features in carved stone, there is scarcely a trace ; of mosaic there is none ; in the First Church there is some terra cotta; and a large chime of bells, also there, might be added to this list. Charlestown is, however, not ex ceptionally poor in Art for an American place of its size. INSTITUTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE. Funds for educational, benevolent, and religious purposes have long existed in the town, but only in recent times have there been buildings that represented any of them. The old Church funds were in land aud notes (in 1788, 32 acres, and .\u00a3174. 7. 4). The Charlestown Poor's Fund, originating at least as early as 1674 in the bequest of Richard Russell (\u00a3200.), was increased by that of Capt. Richard Sprague (equal, 1749, to $460, silver), of Mr. Rand (\u00a338. 12), and of Thos. Call (1772, $88.89). After the Revolution it was, from time to time, still more increased, until now, counting the se curities at par, it amounts to $23,300. The Free School Fund, dating from 1647 and 1660, when lands were set apart for the purpose, also grew by degrees, so that, in a report to a Town meeting, Dec., 1792, it was \"prized\" at \u00a3861.12.1. After that time slight additions were made, and money for free education was raised by taxa tion. Other funds, more or less public, and for special or less general objects, also exist. Of institutions occupying buildings wholly devoted to their use, one, of which the germ appears at perhaps the earliest date, although both name and development are recent, is the Young Men's Christian Association. As far back as 1739 there was a \" Society of Young Men in Charlestown, who [were] United together for the Exercises of Religion on the Lord's Day Evenings,\" to whom the Rev. Hull Abbot preached"], [104, "62 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. (July 8) a sermon on Early Piety. The modern form of the institution was, however, long afterwards organized. In June, 1853, the Young Men's Evangelical Union was begun, with members from the two Trinitarian Congregational, three Bap tist, two Methodist, the Bethesda, and St. John's churches. It ' owed \" its origin to the late philanthropic movement in all our large cities, to rescue and aid young men constantly coming . . . from the interior,\" who \" stand much in need of fellow ship and assistance,\" says the preface to its By-laws. Through changes an organization with similar purpose, although with enlarged or modified forms, has continued, and now occupies a large wooden building developed from that of the Seminary on Union Street. It was paid for by subscription, and in it a reading-room, and a hall with an organ and a stage for lectures or evening amusements are provided. In 1833 the Infant School Society opened its school at 6 Warren Street, and in 1834 was incorporated. For many years (1834-70) it maintained a (wooden) house on Richmond Street, and took care of young children. To this name that of Children's Home was added in 1869, and a larger and better building (also wooden) on Austin Street, has been owned and supported by members of the Protestant societies. Its objects are commendable, and justly its condition is prosperous. In connection with it are especially associated the labors and name of Miss Mary D. Balfour. A still larger institution, now supported by funds ($34,092 in 1886) and by general contributions, and managed in a simi lar manner, originated (1865) in a bequest (valued at $10,000) by an old resident, and from her receives its name of The Winchester Home for Aged, Women. Of these beneficiaries there were in 1886 thirty-five, aged from 61 to 89. At first the three-storied wooden house long occupied by Jas. K. Froth ingham was used, but as more room was wanted, a picturesque building was erected (1872-73) on adjacent land. It has two stories and a high basement of red brick, a so-called French roof with another good story, and a flattened pyramidal bit of roof to accent the centre. The architect was S. J. F. Thayer, and the whole cost about $45,000, obtained by subscriptions and bequests."], [105, "63 INSTITUTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE. Until April, 1872, \" Charlestown, with its thirty thousand inhabitants, was without any organization, excepting that of the overseers of the poor, for the ready medical and surgical relief of the sick and maimed poor,\" wrote the Rev. C. E. Grin nell, chairman of a meeting called by Dr. E. J. Forster, who was then chosen superintendent of an institution incorporated Feb., 1873, as the Charlestown Free Dispensary and Hospital. With a small fund, but chiefly supported by annual subscriptions, it continues to do good work, attending annually to about a thousand cases, rather less than half of which are with patients of foreign birth, although most of them are of foreign parentage. Other societies, but without special buildings, have also been, from time to time, formed for benevolent purposes. As early as 1802, the Rev. Dr. Morse and associates formed what was prac tically a germ of the more modern Tract Societies. \" There can be little doubt,\" says S. E. Morse (1867), \"that in 1802, the pastor and people of the First Parish in Charlestown had done more in circulating religious tracts among the poor and destitute in the United States, than any other people in New England.\" It would be difficult now to find or make up a set of the works thus distributed, but there were 32,600 copies of 19 tracts. In 1813, ninety-nine persons of all classes and be liefs formed the Charlestown Association for the Reformation of Morals, an object for which extraordinary means were then thought necessary. The Rev. Dr. Morse, foremost in the good works of the town, was the chairman. Six years later (Nov. 1, 1819) the Female Benevolent Society was formed, the name Bevens being substituted for Female, Dec. 26, 1856. Its mem bers are chiefly of the Universalist Society, and its object is to provide clothing for the needy. The Mechanic Union Charita ble Association was incorporated in 1839, and in 1853 was formed the Bunker Hill Mutual Loan and Fund Association. The modern form of religious ministration known as the City Missionary, was begun by the organization, Dec., 1843, of the Charlestown City Mission and Tract Society, composed of members \" of all the Evangelical Churches of the Town,\" the directors being the minister and one layman from each of eight"], [106, "64 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. churches. The first president was Capt., afterwards Commo dore, J. B. Montgomery, a member of the First Church. In 1851, the operations of the Society were made more compre hensive, and these continued for a considerable period. Mean while, in 1846 (April 19), the Unitarians began a similar work called the Ministry at Large, that was continued until 1879, the Rev. 0. C. Everett being most of the time, and indeed the chief, minister (Oct. 1, 1850, to Aug., 1869). For this enterprise the wooden Harvard chapel, costing $10,000, built on Edge worth Street, was dedicated Feb. 12, 1856. It was sold at auction July 31, 1879. During the Civil War, Charlestown, in work for the help and comfort of those under arms, was honorably represented by the Bunker Hill Soldiers Relief Society, originated April 19, 1861. Naturally, and very properly, it was neither sectarian nor partisan, and hard and nobly worked the many ladies, its members. Mrs. H. G. Hutchins was the first President ; Mrs. W. L. Hudson, V. P. ; Mrs. H. Lyon, Sec. ; Miss A. B. Bates, Treas. They were helped by funds as follows, from 1862-63 1863-64 Bunker Hill Assv, California, James Hunnewell, Charlestown, From all other sources, $2,735.50 $743.65 500.00 500.00 1,740.28 2,404.01 $4,975.78 $3,647.66 In the Roman Catholic churches there have been large and efficient organizations for their members. The Mutual Relief Society of St. Mary's was instituted January, 1834, and incor porated March 1, 1844 ; the Father Matthew Mutual Benevo lent Total Abstinence Society, also of St. Mary's, dates from August 30, 1849, and the St. Francis de Sales Church Belt Society from 1879. The latter proved one of the greatest successes of the kind in the history of the town. A large number of organizations into which benevolent work enters exist also in the Lodges, Orders, and other pri vate associations. If not Benevolent Societies, the old Fire Societies were formed and maintained for the public or social good, and may properly be mentioned here. There were three organized"], [107, "65 MILITARY COMPANIES. after the Revolution, \u2014 the Ph\u0153nix (1795), the Washington1 (1800), and the Jefferson (1810). The oldest was, however, the Ancient,''' instituted Nov. 8, 1743, composed of house holders acting for mutual protection or aid, and maintained until paid public companies took the place of such early and more restricted associations. The number of members was limited to 25, one of whom was clerk and treasurer. Candi dates stood proposed three months, and two negatives on a ballot excluded. Each member was obliged to keep two leather buckets, two bags (1J X | yd.) with his name on them, and a bed-key and belt, and, on notice of a fire, must \" repair with his buckets, bags, and key, to the place where it happens\" (Rules, p. 5), and \"use his best endeavors\" to save property of the members. A pair of leather buckets that belonged to James Hunne well, who joined the Society soon after his final return from the Pacific, still hangs a few yards from the writer's desk, a reminder of an old and necessary, but now disused, custom. A few rods distant, in notable contrast, is the incomparably equipped station, and the efficient professional corps of the Fire Department of the present. MILITARY COMPANIES.

Peaceful and safe as the place has been nearly all the time since its settlement, the risks of the earlier years, and even of the Provincial period, made troops desirable, and, indeed, neces sary ; and subsequent exigencies, down to our own day, have shown the wisdom of having some good military organization. For service in \" King Philip's War,\" at Louisburg, in the Rev olution, the war of 1812, the Mexican War, and that for the Union, \u2014 especially the last, \u2014 Charlestown has furnished men. For the first, \" one of its citizens, Capt. Samuel Hunting, raised a company of ' Praying Indians,' which mustered here \" (1675), says Mr. Frothingham, and (1676) \" having some English in it, performed efficient service.\" Citizens also enlisted, or were impressed, in other companies. As early as 1686, Rev. Cotton Mather preached (Sep. 13) at an Artillery Election held here, \" a very good Discourse,\" wrote Judge Sewall, who adds that the \" Company had like to have been broken up ; the animosity so high between Charlestown and Cambridge Men about the Place of Training.\" In Col. Thos. Gardner's Middlesex Regi ment, at Bunker's Hill, was a company under Capt. Josiah Harris, raised in Charlestown. It did good service on the bank of tlie Mystic, at the left flank of the Provincial line, and was \" the last to retreat.\" Along with the rebuilding of the town occurred the formation of the Artillery Company 1 (1786), and two more companies were added to the militia in 1804, \u2014 the Warren Phalanx, and the Light Infantry. The former is continued ; the latter two lasted about forty years ; and the Columbian Guards half as long, dating from 1818. In 1850, the City Guards were organized, and they had an active career, as also have had the Cadets, organized in 1864. Besides these were the Jackson Guards (Co. G, 9th Reg.), 1 Capt., Wm.

C, 1st Batt. Cavalry) dating from 1863. During the war for the Union, Charlestown furnished its full share of soldiers. In addition to those scattered in a great many companies, no small number in the aggregate, they largely composed other companies. For 3 months' service (May-July, 1861) in the Fifth Regiment, there were in Co. C, 41 ; in K, 66 ; for 100 days (1864), in Co. D,72 ; in H, 58 ; for 9 months (Sep., 1862, to July, 1863) in Co. A, 86 ; in D, 89 ; in H, 95 ; while in the Forty- seventh there were 85 in Co. E. For 3 years (from July, 1863) there were 124 in Co. I, of the Thirty-second, and (from July, 1862) 95 in Co. B, of the Thirty-sixth Infantry. (For Regimental Histories, see pp. 276, 277.) Since the war there have been organizations of the Grand Army for veterans ; and for the young, who are likely to learn what a long future has in store, there are the High School Cadets. OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The one existing public work of the town that can be called ancient, is the Powder House, near the corner of the road to Arlington and that between Cambridge and Medford, on land now in Somerville ; indeed it is almost the only such work of the Provincial times to be found throughout a wide region. Its walls, built of rough broken stones, perhaps 30 ft. high, form, as measured by the writer (April 15, 1886), a nearly exact circle 60| feet in circumference on the outside. At the one door (towards the north) they are 2^ feet thick, and the diameter of the interior directly thence is 14 ft., 2 in. Both outside and inside they curve slightly inward towards the top, which is covered by a tall conical wooden and shingled roof with curved outlines. Across the interior, until recently, there were heavy beams, and flooring, all of late broken, but these have been removed, leaving the whole space clear ; the floor is the earth ; the doorway unclosed, as also is a window oppo site ; and the interior is dirty. Otherwise the structure is in tolerably good condition. Its roof was painted, and its walls"], [112, "68 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. were whitewashed on the outside, a few years ago. The site appears to have belonged to Richard Lowden, one of the ear liest inhabitants (1638), whose executor sold it (1703) to Jon* Fosket, and he (1703) to John Mallet, from whose son's widow it passed (1747) to Michael Mallet. Of the latter, Wm Foye, Treas. of the Province, bought (1747) the \" stone edifice, formerly a windmill,\" with a lot, \u00a3 of an acre square, the mill being in the centre. After the Revolution (?) it seems to have passed to Peter Tufts, and has been held by Nathan Tufts and his descendants. From the time it was built (probably before 1710) the edifice was for many years a widely known grist-mill, and then, for a much longer period, was a storehouse for all, or a great part of, the powder belonging to the Province and the State. There is probably no other existing monument of the open ing of the American Revolution as entire, old, and important as this Powder-House. It has been preserved chiefly by pri vate care, but will probably sometime be kept by more secure and permanent tenure than anything private can be under our institutions. The event that gives it a notable place in the history of the United States is described in the \" Essex Ga zette,\" Sep. 6, 1774, p. 2: \u2014 \" Boston, Monday, September 5. On Wednesday last the new Divan (consisting of the wretched Fugitives with whom the just in dignation of their respective Townsmen, by a well deserved expulsion, have filled this Capital), usurped the Seats round the Council Board in Boston. Their deliberations have not hitherto transpired, and with equal secresy, on Thursday morning at half after Four, about 260 Troops embarked on board 13 boats at the Long- Wharf and proceeded up Medford River, to Temple's Farm, where they landed, and went to the Powder-House, on Quarry-hill, in Charlestown bounds, whence they have taken 250 half barrels of powder, the whole store, and carried it to the castle.\" The account published in Boston is briefer : \u2014 \" This Morning a Party of the Troops proceeded to Charlestown, and took Possession of the Powder in the Powder-House there, and are now conveying it round to Boston, in Waggons, and then pro ceeded to Medford Powder House for the like Purpose.\" (Mass. Gazette, Sep. 1, 1774, p. 2.)"], [113, "OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 69 Ammunition was as precious as cash to the Provincials, and the seizure of it here had an exceptional importance, making this raid especially momentous as an opening event in the struggle for national life. While ground that once belonged to Charlestown still bears an old, and almost unique, preserved historical monument, it also bears an American rarity, a ruin, \u2014 a slight fragment, in deed, but half a century old,- \u2014 the relic of a Convent. In 1820 an extensive tract of land, including the Ploughed Hill of Revolutionary times, was secured, and on it Drs. Matignon and Cheverus, \" with funds given by a native citizen of Bos ton,\" founded this institution. Six years later its community, of the Order of St. Ursula, which was established in 1536, came to town and occupied a farm-house at the foot of the hill, \" until the main building on its summit was finished,\" as it was in 1827. The education of girls was one of the pur poses of the Order, and accordingly a Seminary for them was here opened. Its reputation \" was widely extended, and the number of pupils from all the New England, and from many of the Southern States, and the British Provinces, rapidly in creased ; so that in the year 1829, it was found necessary to add two large wings to the building.\" (Report, 1834.) The only Roman service that the Protestant scholars were required to attend was the Latin mass on Sunday in the chapel. (Ace, 1834, p. 16.) At different times there were from four to ten or twelve nuns, and from forty to sixty pupils. Various re ports, that appear to have been unfounded or exaggerated, were circulated about doings in the Convent, until on the even ing of Aug. 11, 1834, a mob attacked and burned the build ing, after dispersing its inmates (12 nuns, and 57 girls, some of the latter quite young). Great excitement existed before and after the event, and a considerable number of now rare pub lications relate to it (Bib., p. 57). While the building was left a wreck, considerable fragments stood many years afterwards, but now (1887) only the lowest portion of the basement is left, in some places scarcely above the surface of the ground ; but the form and size of the building can still be clearly determined, as, if the destruction continues, they cannot be a few years hence."], [114, "70 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Measurements were made by the writer, and J. M. H., April 12, 1886. The basement walls, 20 in. thick at the bottom, were built of split slate stone laid in common lime mortar, and above them were 16 in. walls of red brick. The building seems to have stood directly on the natural surface of the ground, without a cellar except a small one at the west end, much of the outer side of it being above ground, so that it was entered there by a wide door, a fragment of one jamb still re maining. The main part of the Convent, surmounted by a cupola, was three, the other parts two, stories high, and the style appears to have been very simple. In front there was a large circular garden, with little paths and thickly set clusters of small shrubs, all still shown by remains. Towards the Winter Hill road there was a high, steep slope with terraces, along which curved a driveway, while on the other hand there was an abrupt descent towards Medford turnpike, from which the Convent grounds were separated by the Middlesex Canal. From the front and rear extended the broad, slightly \" crown ing \" top of the ridge-like hill, commanding, as it now does except due east, a very wide and noble prospect. No other public buildings now of the town, besides some of the places of -worship, are over thirty years old, or without important change made within that period. Few historical or personal associations are consequently gathered around them, and, furthermore, by their designs they do not to any great degree illustrate the history of American art, of moderate length as that is ; and although somewhat expensive, they can, with few exceptions, hardly be called works of any form of real art. Much more in them are shown the influences of the early days, making practical use, rather than monumental or artistic expression, their characteristic. Of a cost far beyond any tried, or dreamed of, here generations ago, partly built of materials more substantial than any that the times then made possible, they yet show noticeably the old precedent of inflam mable construction. The traditions of lath and plaster, of wooden stairs, floors, and roofs, are followed, with a subservi ency not exclusively Chinese or Charlestonian. Inadequate accommodations for Town offices and secular"], [115, ""], [116, "TOWN HALI>\u00bb WARREN PHALANX, 1838."], [117, "71 OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS. gatherings of the people, in over thirty years, made a building for both wanted. Accordingly in 1818 a Town Hall was built on the Square (Plan I., 2). It was of good size, three stories high, \u2014 a tall basement of cut granite, two stories of red brick, \u2014 and had a roof sloped four ways. Along the middle there was a ridgepole, from which ran a depressed gable towards the front, and at the centre of the edifice rose a white wooden cupola. The style was simple but dignified, with slight at tempt at architectural features. On the first floor were shops, on the second was a hall of good size, with large square headed windows on each side, plain walls covered with \" mar bled\" paper, and a plain whitewashed ceiling supported by half a dozen Roman Doric pillars of wood painted to suggest an imaginary motley yellow marble. The best hall the Town has had for nearly two and a half centuries, it stood forty years and was the scene of many a lively Town meeting, of Fairs that of course did a great deal of good, of the earliest \"classic\" concerts heard in the place, of series of Lyceum lectures, and other events. In it, on these occasions, often met, one time and another, all of old Charlestown now nearly vanished. Again were larger municipal accommodations wanted. In 1868 the old building was torn down, and the City Hall, a higher building, of red brick with brownstone and painted wooden trimmings, was erected on the same area, but with a wing on Harvard Street added (making the whole 100 x 87 ft.). Although it contains several large rooms, there is no hall. In the wing are the Police court and headquarters, together with cells, that, except two large safes or strong rooms, are the most substantial parts of the edifice. On the inside there is scarcely any attempt at architectural style or features ; on the outside most of the finish is said to be in Italian Renaissance, but it is of a kind hard to find in Italy. Most of the structure is cov ered by a so-called French roof, the central part being sur mounted by an octagonal wooden and slated dome, that rises from a square base. Since annexation the second floor of the main part has been occupied by the Public Library. Here, besides books, are nearly all the works of art in the town that"], [118, "72 A CENT DRY OF TOWN LIFE. are public property.1 The edifice was dedicated June 17, 1869, and cost $111,200. Next in importance are the School Souses, High and Gram mar, all of which are built of red brick with more or less of stone trimmings. Their cost, size, and order according to age are stated below.

Of these buildings, the third Winthrop (now the Frothing ham), is the most picturesque, and perhaps the most satisfactory, and shows the nearest approach to a defined architectural style. It is in what is called modern Gothic, is trimmed with sandstone and black bricks, and has gables and grouped windows. Mayor Cobb, at the dedication (Apr. 6, 1876), said that \" it cost far less than any recent building of its class in [Boston], and is inferior to none of them in the extent of its accommodations,\" and in its sanitary appliances. The city had already borrowed two and a half millions that were spent on school-houses, some of them demolished long before the debt on them was paid. A new way was, however, followed here, and \" this house, together with the land it stands on,\" was fully paid for out of the tax levy. In connection with these statements it is curious to 1 Paintings : Full length portraits of D. Webster (by John Pope), given by citizens, 1853 ; Geo. Washington, after Stuart, by J.

The Harvard ranks perhaps next, ar chitecturally, and although not in one of the older recognized styles, and capped by a massive cornice of painted wood, it has a look of dignity. The High School building, while also show ing an attempt to realize something new in effect and detail, is a pretty good one. Of the other large structures of this class in town, it may be said that while they are rather plain, and do not teach much in art or beauty, they may be fairly consid ered superior to not a few of their date, and even more costly, seen in the country. The primary school-houses, it should be added, are, while smaller and plainer, both neat and convenient. The number of scholars in the Charlestown schools, in 1886, averaged according to the Report, 2,241 primary (49 teachers), and 3,065 grammar (59 teachers), or a total of 5,306 scholars with 108 teachers. PLACES OF AMUSEMENT. Turning from instruction to amusement we find that build ings for the latter can be briefly described. There are none. The town never had a theatre or a concert-room, yet it has occasionally been favored by visits of a circus. For entertain ments of the sort provided by the last, there was a comparatively permanent structure of boards and canvas that stood near the southeasterly corner of the Waverley House before and after 1828. It was called the \" Charlestown Circus,\" and there old citizens speak of having seen the \" Forty Thieves \" performed with live horses as well as actors ; there also was shown H. A. Barker's Panorama of the Battle of Paris (1814), \" painted on 3,024 feet of canvas.\" In the old Town Hall there were con certs and other occasional performances, as also there have been at a more recent date in Waverley and Monument Halls, in each of which, as well as in the Navy Yard, a stage has been fitted up, where amateurs have agreeably given plays. Observ ers of the changes in thought and practice will notice that a more permanent stage is found in the Hall of the Young Men's Christian Association, and used in a similar manner."], [120, "74 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. MONUMENTS. Charlestown still has, honorably preserved, one of those treas uries of family history usually found in the older towns of New England, that, if apt to be of moderate value in art, are sure to be of great interest, and an important part of the local records ; indeed of the quiet village, or of the place grown to be a city, they are apt to be the only chronicles in stone. The Old Burial-Ground here is still all this after existing through more than two centuries, with their wear and change, including as they have the stress of war and risks of hostile occupation. Probably within fifteen years of the settlement one of the most retired and picturesque spots on the peninsula was chosen and used as the last resting-place of the towns people. It was a green little knoll, around two sides of which flowed the then clear waters of a bay in the west bank of Charles River. There to the scattered stones set up by earlier generations more and more were added, until the ground was crowded. By degrees the buildings of the increasing town grew nearer, and at length pressed close on every side, so that now it is quite hemmed in, and, if the truth is said, by objects far from beautiful. Yet stones and turf, tombs and some good sized trees, are well kept ; some of the stones are moved or gone, but on the whole fair care is bestowed on the now scarce used, but always precious old place. Around the border curves a nar row carriage road, at the inner side of which, with slight inter ruption for two thirds of the distance, are ranges of brick tombs whitewashed ; back of them on the slopes are the thickly set stones, among which, here and there, are large altar-shaped mon uments dating from long before the present century, and others taller erected later. On the top of the hill is a granite obelisk 15 feet high, 4 feet square at the base, and 2 feet at the top, put there in 1 828 by alumni of Harvard, in memory of the minister whose name is borne by their College. \" In piam et perpetuam memoriam,\" and other dutiful words, have already crumbled from the marble slabs then exposed upon the granite, but the memory of the honored pastor is still cherished, and there is an opportunity for some one to renew the inscription."], [121, "75 MONUMENTS. Few burial-grounds in New England can still show older stones. At least six here are before 1670, and several are of the first settlers or their children, and some are of persons born, or adults, before the town was even thought of, or its site really explored. Nearly all the earlier stones are short thick slabs of greenish slate, often embellished with a death's head, and are remark ably well preserved. A few are red sandstone, that was used more, yet not a great deal, during the first half of the last cen tury. Purple slate in larger pieces then superseded both ma terials, and white marble, the least durable of all, came into use chiefly in this century. In April, 1887, the writer copied the dates of deaths, and the names as there spelled, on all, or nearly all, the stones dated before 1700. All, early and late, are generally grouped by families, and arranged so that they would be on a slope of the knoll towards the part of the town where the persons buried had lived.

Michael Gill, 1720 (about a foot high, slab 6* x 3\u00a3 ft.) ; next, John Long, 1684 (1 ft. high, slab granite, b\\ x 2| ft.) ; one H., 2 ft. high, pale slab, 6 ft. 5 in. x 31 feet; another H., 1\\ ft. high, gray slab split, and corners broken, 5|- x 2 ft. 11 in. Southerly is a row of five tombs, one H., slab on the ground ; then Abigail, wife of James Russell, 1709, 5\u00a3 x 2| ft. ; James Russell, 1709 ; gray slab, Mavd Russell, 1642 (the earliest date on the ground} ; and Richard Russell, 1676, renewed by the family in 1787 (all these four are about 1\\ ft. high) ; and beyond, a gray slab, H., on the ground. Near the top of the knoll are Judge Iohn Phillips, 1725, Katharine, 1698, and Henry, son of John, 1729 (?), in one tomb with a gray slab, 1\\ x 3^- ft. ; one, H., is on the ground. Near the foot of the slope, S. E., is William Stitson, date il. ; near the top of the knoll, S. E. one about 2 ft. high, gray slab, H., now No. 70. South of the Harvard obelisk, and near it, is the best finished of all these tombs, 2| ft. high, with sides, as well as top (6| x 3 ft.), of red sandstone, the tomb of the '\u25a0'\u25a0Min isters of the first church\" (as stated on a white marble slab at the end, placed there at the cost of the writer), where several who died during or before the Revolution were buried. S. W. is one of David Newell, with new brick sides ; another il. ; and N. W. a third, also illegible. At the foot of the slope, N. W., are nine brick tombs with pur ple slate slabs, in the round heads of which are family arms cut in a style far superior to any other elaborated carving in the Ground. From E. to W. they are of Hon. Jonat. Dows, 1725 ; Ezekiel Cheever, 1744 ; Hon. Charles Chambers, 1743 [beside it a slab of fine red slate, no arms, to Rev. T. Prentiss, 1817] ; Jenner, 1725 ; Foster, Sarah, 1724, Hon. Richard, 1774, etc. ; Jonathan Lemmon, 1724 [here, a white marble slab, no arms, to Hon. James Russell, 1798, Katharine, 1778, and their chil dren]; Thomas Greaves, 1747; David Wood, 1762 [Wyer, Soley, Sam. Henley, three tombs without arms] ; and Samuel"], [125, "79 MONUMENTS. Cary, 1740-1. There are 9 tombs with hewn granite fronts all (except two small, eastward) on the N. W. slope, and lettered Joseph Hunnewell, Thomas Hunnewell, Joseph Smith, Charles Perry (two, where Union soldiers are buried), James Hunne well (with an obelisk of polished red Scotch granite), and Walker. The small number of other monuments (very few of which are enclosed) are modern. A great many stones bear dates through the last century ; these, like all inscriptions here, have been carefully copied by E. N. and A. Coburn. It should also be added that the Ground is now in the care of the mu nicipal authorities of Boston. Bunker Hill Monument is of national interest, not only as a memorial of the great opening battle \u2014 and one of the most important actions \u2014 of the Revolution, but also as one of the earliest, and, for a long while, the largest, works of its kind in the country. Its history, although sevoral times told, can well be condensed here from a dozen or more publications. Wm. Tudor is said to have first advocated purchase of the battle-ground and the erection on it of a grand monument. He and four other gentlemen acted together (1823), the Russell pasture (2| acres) was bought, costing $ 1,250, and (June 27) 24 gentlemen were incorporated as the B. H. M. Association, and 25 more were elected members. To solicit funds, a prospectus was, in July, distributed through the country, followed (Sep. 20, 1824) by an 8\u00b0 \" circular \" from the Directors, and (Oct. 1) by an earnest printed appeal, sent to the Selectmen in Massa chusetts. In 1825, an Act of the Legislature to aid (in ham mering stone at the Prison, and in taking land) was passed (Feb. 26) ; more land was secured (in all, 15 acres, costing $23,232.43), and a subscription was headed in Boston by Hon. Wm. Phillips with -11,000, and David Sears and Peter C. Brooks $500 each. By Sep. 1 the amount raised was $54, 433.67, and meanwhile, June 17th, the corner-stone was laid with a great deal of ceremony (that by the report, 1830, cost $4,720.85). Plans had been considered, and (Oct. 1) Solo mon Willard, a \" self-educated man,\" was unanimously elected architect, and his design of the existing obelisk was adopted. In Feb., 1829, fourteen courses (37^ ft. high) stood above"], [126, "80 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. ground, and hoisting works together with a large quantity of cut stone were on the spot ; but the funds were exhausted, and operations were suspended. Work was only resumed June 17, 1834, and continued until Nov., 1835, when a height of 85 feet was reached. Further attempts were made to obtain money. A lottery, then a recognized and common mode, was petitioned for (Dec., 1829), but abandoned ; an appeal for direct aid from the State was unsuccessful ; an Address to its citizens (8\u00b0, pp. 8) was issued (1831), and a Report (8J, pp. 15, 1832). Controversy ensued, then the financial crisis (1836-40), and the Associa tion became embarrassed, so that a large amount of the land was sold at auction (Wed., Sep. 25, 1839).1 At length the ladies did what the men could not, or did not do ; they held a Fair (Sep. 8-15, 1840) in Quincy Hall, Boston, that netted the then unexampled and splendid sum of $30,035.53. Amos Lawrence of Boston, and Judah Truro of New Orleans, each added $10,000. Work was again resumed (Nov., 1840), and on Saturday, July 23, 1842, at 6 a.m., the top stone was raised. Jas. S. Savage was the contractor, and Solomon Willard saw the completion of his own design. June 17, 1843, there was a great celebration of the event, attended by many prominent men, including John Tyler, President of the United States. For years (1835-40) the unfinished obelisk had stood sur rounded by a maze of granite blocks and a wild area of grass-ground, and later by rough banks and newly graded lots. Until 1843, a sloping road, with flat stone tracks for wheels, led from the S. E. corner to the monument. Soon afterwards, all this was changed, and the present Square was substantially completed. In 1857, a white marble statue of Gen. Warren, by Henry Dexter, was placed in a wooden lodge northward, and in 1871 Monument Avenue was opened from Main Street, giving a better approach, and a much better view 1 As the Square then laid out was unsurpassed by any other in or close to, Boston, it is of interest to note the prices obtained for lots. Jacob Foss (of C. ) gave the highest price, 41 cts. per foot, at the corner of High and Concord Streets, while the lowest was 10 cts., paid by W. Appleton, for land between Monument and Concord Streets."], [127, "MONUMENTS. 81 of the obelisk. Up to 1878 the total cost, including land, was $133,649.83. Towards this cost Charlestown contributed lib erally. By the Report in 1830, we can count 518 subscribers there, giving $4,029. From Nathan Tufts came the only legacy ever received, $1,000. Proceeds from the town's table at the Fair (1840) were second in amount received at any, or $1,546.37. Subscribers to the Warren statue gave $1,250 (out of $5,125 raised). These items make a total of $7,825.37. While a part of the money obtained at the Fair did not come from the town, other amounts have, so that it is within bounds to say that six per cent \u2014 nearly one sixteenth \u2014 of the cost of this national work was given by the townspeople. To be sure, about $14,000 was paid sundry of them for land, but at the sale (1839) others largely offset it by their purchases. President G. W. Warren's copious History (1877) and Re ports of the Association supply many of the particulars already given. For those about the great obelisk, reference is made to President Frothingham's \"Siege\" (1849), where (p. 356) the height is given at 221 feet, the diameter 30 feet at the base and half as much at the top. Below the surface of the ground is a foundation 12 feet deep, composed of heavy stones (12 x _\\\\ X 2 feet), and upward through the centre of the interior is a cylin der 10 feet across at the bottom and 6J at the top. In the middle of it is a well, and around it a stairway with 294 steps leading to a room 11 feet across and 17 feet high, with an arched top, lighted by four small windows. Cut granite is used for all parts above ground, and for those below, the same material uncut. It may be added that the ground adjacent has been graded regularly, and shows little or none of the original surface, but nearly the original elevation. An area of about four acres making the Square, 400 feet on each side, is en closed by an iron fence, without and within which is a line of trees growing slowly yet now of considerable size. From the surrounding streets four granite stairs lead up a bank on all sides of the area, and paths extend thence to the monument. Criticised as the work may be, it is a grand one, eminent on its historic site, noble among the historical memorials built in modern times. 6"], [128, "82 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. Two other monuments are closely connected with it. Inside is a white marble model of the first monument here, erected in 1794 by King Solomon's Lodge of Charlestown. It was a square wooden Tuscan pillar on a brick base, in all about 30 feet high, that was at last rather mysteriously damaged or destroyed in 1825. In front of the obelisk stands one of the very best and most appropriate statues, at least, in the State, a bronze figure (1881) of Col. Wm. Prescott, his long, loose \" banyan coat \" thrown open by the wind, his sword in hand, his broad-brimmed hat on his head, his attitude just what it was when he looked at the coming charge. The work is at once an honor to those who gave it, to William W. Story the sculptor, and to the hero of the redoubt in the battle of Bunker Hill. (See Frontispiece.) After the war for preserving the Union, the struggle to found which fully began on Bunker Hill, other events and heroes were to be commemorated, and Charlestown, like a great number of places, raised a Soldiers' Monument to those who had gone from it, and had fallen in the national defence. Some thought that a memorial of volunteers in this service should be paid for by voluntary contributions, but other opin ions prevailed, and the cost was defrayed by taxation. A square base bearing three large figures, all designed by Martin Milmore and made of Hallowell granite, stands in the old Trainingfield, now very neatly and prettily laid out. The work was dedicated June 17, 1872. As a class, the numerous memorials of this kind are far greater evidences of affection ate regard for the soldiers and sailors than of genius in art. Whatever may be thought of this particular work, it is very much superior to not a few well-meant and expensive objects to be seen in the country, and that make us glad that the de fenders of the flag have a great deal more honor than is done them in some of the designs. NATIONAL AND STATE INSTITUTIONS. Appropriately, close by the first great battle-ground of Inde pendence, the new national government established one of its"], [129, "NATIONAL AND STATE INSTITUTIONS. 83 most important stations for the defence of what was secured by the Revolution. A site had been proposed at Noddle's Island, but a committee on the part of the town represented (1800), that this would be \" almost as injurious to it as a second conflagration.\" While still embarrassed by their \" unequalled Sufferings \" in the late war, the townspeople, as they then stated, were, after years of \" industrious application \" enabled \" to sustain a decent rank with [their] fellow citizens at large,\" and they urged that a site they proposed should be chosen. On June 17, 1800, the Legislature authorized the United States to purchase land in Charlestown for the Navy Yard, and \" between 40 and 50 acres,\" \" valued by a Jury at $37,280,\" were bought, or at about half the price asked by the owners. This area was very well situated beside some of the deepest water and in one of the most secure parts of the har bor, and also included the landing-place of the British troops on June 17, 1775. Both land and sea-front were by degrees well laid out, and what is thought to be one of the best pieces of property of its kind owned by the nation has been the result. The chief structure on it is a dry dock of hewn granite (341 X 80 feet, and 30 deep), planned by Loammi Baldwin, and built (1827-34) at a cost of $370,089. A ropewalk (1836), said to be the best in the country, also of granite (1360 ft. long), is of one story, except at the northerly end, where a second (748 ft.) was added (1856), and where there is a head-house (60 x 70 ft.) of three stories. One of the ear liest buildings (1803) is of brick, near the entrance to the Yard, and of the same material is the large house of the Com mandant (1809). Trees and grass-grounds well arranged make the place really beautiful in summer. Purchases of land and covering of flats have increased the area to 87-| acres, while liberal expenditure of money, with rise in the value of real estate, make the establishment represent a very large sum. A much larger one would not now, however, se cure another as well placed and fitted. There are shiphouses (3), high and substantial timber-sheds (4), granite store houses (4), wet docks, the dry dock, and over twenty other well-built structures for various purposes. For the names of"], [130, "84 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. .the many distinguished commandants (about 25), and of the famous vessels built here (21 before 1860, and 40 since), be sides a great number refitted, reference should be made to the account written by the late Admiral Geo. H. Preble (Mem. Hist. Boston, iii.), \u2014 an account so good that it makes us re gret that a full history prepared by him has not been printed. In 1800 (Jan. 22) the Legislature appointed a committee to select and procure land in Charlestown for a State Prison. About five acres, including flats, were bought beside a bay in the northerly bank of Charles River, and during 1804-5, a building (200 x 28 to 44 ft.) of hewn stone, four and five sto ries high, and another of brick (227 x 25 ft.) for workshops, were erected. There was also a workyard (375 x 260 ft.), and the establishment was surrounded by a high strong wall. On the whole work $170,000 were spent. At the time writers stated that the institution commanded a \" rich and variegated prospect,\" and a belief was cherished that it would help to \"promote the happiness of the town.\" Convicts were first re ceived Dec. 12, 1805 (during that month 34), and afterwards in gradually increasing numbers, so that by Aug., 1816, there were 280, guarded by 15 officers. An insurrection was once attempted, when several prisoners scaled the walls, but all of them except one were retaken. Subsequently a man has now and then escaped, but outbreaks of any sort have been uncom mon, and, indeed, the management has been such that it has not caused any large amount of controversial printing. Work of various sorts has been given to persons who were, or could be, fitted for it; firm, even discipline has been maintained, and one in the neighborhood, not knowing of the Prison, would hardly be aware that it existed, it is so quiet and well ordered. Additions to the buildings were from time to time made as needed before 1850, when an octagonal central structure (73 x 68 ft. inside, and 70|- ft. high), and a new wing (90 x 48 x 41 ft.), all of granite, were erected. In 1874 the construction of a new prison at Concord was authorized, and this at Charles town was not used for several years ; but after a costly experi ment had been tried, it was reoccupied, and continues to prove well adapted to its appointed purposes. During the passing"], [131, "ELEVATION of the MASSACHUSETTS STATF. PRISON."], [132, ""], [133, "85 NATIONAL AND STATE INSTITUTIONS. years it has become environed by railroads and buildings, losing its original retirement, and even a certain picturesqueness, yet not its convenience and security. Even the costumes of those connected with it have been hardly less changed ; the officers are better dressed or uniformed, and a red and blue longitudi nal half-and-half garb for those they watched has been discarded for less conspicuous attire. Of course while the population of the State has been increasing rapidly, so also has the number of inmates, now varying from 550 to 600. Reports that have been printed since 1841, a history, descriptions in four publica tions with six large plates, and many pamphlets (see Bibliog raphy), supply an unusual amount of information about the rise, growth, and management of this institution. Near the westerly bank of the bay from Charles River, and opposite the Burial-Ground and Prison, the McLean Asylum for the Insane was built on a knoll that was Charlestown ground until 1842, when it became a part of Somerville. It is a site of historic interest, known as Miller's, or Cobble, Hill in 1775, when (Nov.) it was fortified and made one of the strong- est points in the line of works built by the Provincial forces during the siege of Boston, commanding the ferry across the river and threatening the British redoubts in Charlestown. Here also, in 1777, were quartered some of the troops captured at Saratoga. After the war the land was bought by Joseph Barrell, a merchant of Boston, who erected (1792) a large house and laid out extensive grounds to which the name of Poplar Grove was given, and that were for years a show place. In the settlement of his affairs, the estate was bought for the important institution that bears the name of another merchant, the honored John McLean, and that was opened Oct. 6, 1818. Three large buildings, two of them with domes, the house of Mr. Barrell, and newer structures that have risen as wanted, all surrounded by gardens, grassgrounds, and trees, are still conspicuous monuments of the beneficence of the founder. Extensive usefulness, superior accommodations, and high repu tation, have distinguished the Asylum."], [134, "86 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. OLD HOUSES. The oldest building in Charlestown that the writer has vis ited, and, indeed, has known of as existing in his time, was the house bought by Charles Hunnewell in 1710, and occupied by four generations of his descendants.1 It was probably built about 1690, and was destroyed perhaps five and twenty years ago, certainly through no fault of the late James Hunnewell, who made all due effort for its preservation. Built of wood, two stories high, with narrow windows, a huge chimney in the middle, and low rooms having plastered ceilings crossed by stout, painted beams, it had a snugness and quaintness in creased by really picturesque surroundings ; for it stood back from the road on a couple of little terraces flanked on one side by a garden with a row of very large lilac shrubs, and on the other by a few good-sized elms. In earlier times there was a pleasant outlook from the front towards Cambridge meeting house, less than a mile distant, while behind the ground gently rose to a considerable height from which there was a wide prospect. At present it would be hard enough to find a house that has stood not merely through the American Revolution, but that dates almost from the English of 1688, and is as pretty a relic of early Provincial domestic life. Indeed, this old homestead would not have been out of keeping amid the rural beauty of old England itself. 1 The only printed historical account of the occupants (a brief one is in the \"Journal of the Voyage of the Missionary Packet, Boston to Honolulu, 1826, by James Hunnewell,\" 4\u00b0, 1880 (the writer's privately printed work, no. viii. ), in which also is a Memoir of the Author of the Journal, who was born in this house. Charles Hunnewell, mentioned above, as evidence still shows, was esteemed as a good neighbor, and was in what are called comfortable circumstances, in which, it appears, he was exceeded by but few of his fellow townsmen in his time. He and his descendants were quiet, law-abiding people, apt to mind their own business, go to meeting on Sunday, and not be over anxious for public office. In several docu ments all are called \"yeomen,\" as at first is William (fourth generation, and father of James), but who subsequently, in several cases, is styled \"gentleman.\" The oldest of their books, that the writer has, is a Bible bought by William (grandson of Charles), who paid \u00a36. 10s. for it. As his writing is not quite so bad as that of some of the ministers, and his spelling not worse than that of the schoolmaster, he probably had a fair average education, and he evidently liked a good book."], [135, "87 OLD HOUSES. Of houses burned in 1775 there are, as already stated, few exact or full descriptions. From the best (pp. 118, 124, 138) we can think that there were some of good size and finish ; but as has also been stated (p. 11), while not a few probably were quaint, vague statements at that date are to be credited with reserve. Several erected at or near the rebuilding are mentioned in this chapter, or in the Survey (pp. 116, 119, 124, 132, 135, 139, 143, 144). One of the most prominent of these, from its posi tion and the office of its occupant, was the Parsonage (Plan II.) , of wood (52| x 40T7o), and two stories high. Around it was a garden, and on the slight hill slope southward the Parish Chapel (p. 53). There was also a barn (32| x 19t}), besides a shed (42| long). All the ground was occupied (1835) by Harvard Row (p. 97), and the house was moved to Elm Street, where it stood until 1888. When the town was rebuilt, and later, for a period of per haps forty years, the prevailing English style of building was used, so far as means and the limits of practically available materials allowed. It was what might be called the Georgian style in its simpler forms, in which classic mouldings and cor nices, and even pillars, were to considerable extent copied with more or less accuracy. So little real architectural character was, however, possible, that a classification of the houses must be by forms or plans rather than by styles. Two forms were almost exclusively used. By far the more common one of them was an oblong of two or three stories with an end at the sidewalk of the street, a front entry at the middle of the side with a stair, and a room on each hand ; while attached at the inner end was a wing generally two sto ries high. Along the entrance front was an area of more or less width, lengthwise of which was a path usually paved, be side which, sometimes, was a bed of flowers lined by borders of box plants. In the area also usually stood two elms, horse chestnuts, or trees of some sort. The other form was a square of the same height, with four rooms on a floor, and with a similar wing, the front door being usually on the street; or there was one there and another at the side, and the building"], [136, "88 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. was made for two families. Houses with both of these plans were made of brick as well as of wood. Of the oblong form in wood, the three finest houses in the lower part of the town were those of Mrs. Baker (pp. 129-30), I. Warren (p. 131), and J. Hurd (Plan III. 84). The latter house, built about 1795, and now (1887) occupied by his grand children, is in excellent order. It is painted light brown, is clapboarded, has well moulded window-frames, and a cornice with modillions. It fronts towards a lawn, on which is one of the noblest horsechestnut trees ever in the town, and is entered beneath an Ionic porch, a fine example of the sort attached to some of the older houses. The refinement of the lines and work here, as well as in the window-casings, is in pleasant contrast with some irregular recent designs. Similar in nearly all respects were the first two houses mentioned, that were de molished several years ago. Other notable oblong wooden houses were those of Dr. J. Bartlett (III. 81), Hon. Benj. Thompson (III. 76), Dr. A. R. Thompson (IY. 126), S. John son (p. 148), and Maj. Walker, all on Main Street, and all now much altered. Another, that of Mr. Webb, since Mrs. E. F. Adams's, on Cordis Street, had the largest grounds (now reduced), and might be called the pleasantest. Of brick houses in oblong form there were few. That of M. Bridge (p. 129), later occupied by Edward Everett and others, had a wing at the back. Dr. Walker's (p. 137), with out a wing, Geo. Bartlett's, Union Street, and E. Breed's were three stories high (the upper one of them low), and faced the street. All of them are now (1887) standing. With an end towards the street are those of Dea. A. Tufts (III. 79), and of Jas. Hunnewell (p. 93). Of square brick houses were those of R. Devens, near the Navy Yard ; one at the head of Salem Street, occupied by Mrs. Harrison in 1812; the Makepeace house, built on Main St., near the burial-ground, in 1797, three stories high, ornamented with terra cotta bands, caps, and cornice, and the most elaborate of the earlier brick houses ; and the house built on Charles River Avenue (I. 25) by Hon. Thos. Russell, and not finished at his death (1796). This latter had a front of 52 ft., facing the present Water Street,"], [137, ""], [138, "House of Hon. Jas. Russell"], [139, "89 OLD HOUSES. and was about as deep. On each side towards the back was a wing, making the wall of the rear 70 ft. 10 in. long (shown by a plan with a deed). The brick walls were varied by trim mings of dark stone;1 towards Water St. there was a porch;2 towards the Square a yard with an open slat fence ; l and on the top was a \" large cupola that cost as much as a house.\" 3 For many years, and until it was burned in the great fire, Aug. 28, 1835, it was a public house, known as Gordon's, Nichols's, or the Charlestown Hotel (until 18054), Pierce's,6 or, in 1817, the Brick Hotel,2 and finally as the Middlesex House4-5, kept by Jas. Walker.5 Of the square wooden houses built for one family, the hand somest that ever stood in the town was built by Hon. James Russell in 1780 5 (1790 ?). It was at the corner of the Square and Warren Avenue (opened 1828), and was the family mansion not only until his death (1796), but until his daughter died (1819). During the next seventeen years it was occupied by Com. John Shaw, John Soley (G. M., Grand Lodge of Mass.), Andrew Dunlap (U. S. Dist. Attorney5), and Joseph Thomp son. In 1835 it became a public house,5 known as the Mansion House, successively kept by Gorham Bigelow and Jas. Ram say,5 all the while growing shabby, and still more deprived of its early glory by a row of very dirty houses, popularly called \"Dublin Row,\" that stood on its former garden beside the Ave nue, until all, along with the mansion, were demolished (1866) and replaced by the southerly part of the Waverley House. In the good old English way the Russells held the ground of their ancestral home until the death of the last resident who bore the name ; and although the situation was unfortunate, directly on the market-place of a growing town, the fine mansion was built there as soon as could be after the fire of 1775, and per haps thus got a popular name, said to have been given it, of \" Russell's Folly.\" It6 was three stories high, the upper one of them low, as i Says Mr. H. K. Frothingham. 2 H. H. Edes (Harv. Ch., 125). 8 Hon. G. W. Warren. 4 Records King Sol. Lodge. 6 D. Balfour. 6 The description of the exterior of the Jas.

At each corner there was a Co rinthian pilaster reaching to the cornice, and on top was a cupola. All the mouldings, capitals, and details were of classic character. Before the house was a good-sized yard, bounded by walls at the sides, and a high open fence in front, and crossed at the middle by a paved walk. In the rear, extending to the river, was a garden with three paths running in that direction, while a paved driveway, entered from a narrow street westward, passed between it and the house. In the house there were four rooms on a floor and a hall through the middle. Details of these two Russell houses are here made rather full as some accounts in print have mixed them and do not appear to be correct. Of the notable square wooden houses for one family were those of M. Bridge (p. 116), S. Swan (p. 132), Capt. Cordis (p. 143), John Hurd (p. 134), all now standing, and Richard Frothingham, that was at the corner of Main and Eden Streets. The last, very large, three stories high, well finished, having four entrances, and standing a little back from the sidewalks, was near the middle of the original grant of Wm. Frothingham (1630-38), and of what might be called the Frothingham dis trict (p. 151), that extended nearly across the peninsula. Another square house of one of the family, Dea. Jas., still re mains, at the corner of Washington and Union Streets ; it is two stories high, elevated on a terrace, and placed several feet back from the sidewalks. Originally it commanded a wide view of West Boston and Charles River. At the corner of Winthrop and Main streets (pp. 133-34) is a very early house. Several square wooden houses were built for two families, among which were those of D. Wood (p. 149), and another of early date belonging in the same family, subsequently made a tavern, and, to give room for the Harvard meeting-house, re moved to the corner of Main and Miller streets. There was also one long occupied by Wm. Austin and Capt. Boyd on High and Wood streets, that was, some time ago, converted into a single house, a very good one, for many years the home"], [141, ""], [142, "UHNKEIt HILL FROM THi; NAVY YAltl).

An unusually large one stands on Washington Street ; and there is another on High Street (52 X 36), originally connected by interior doors, later occupied (north side) by P. Willard, and then modernized. All these houses had three stories (the upper one of them low), and are standing (1887), although more or less altered. At the end of the last century, and in the earlier part of the present, mansion houses for single families were built on the slopes of Breed's Hill. There were eight that were notable, two of brick, and oblong, six of wood, and square, five of them being of two, and one of three stories. All but two of the latter are now (1887) standing. All had grounds of good, some of large, extent, one of the estates only now remaining of the original size, the others being more or less reduced, and three nearly covered by recent buildings. Besides these eight was the Commandant's house at the Navy Yard, built in 1809, two sto ries high, of brick, square, with two bold swells towards a garden and the Yard and harbor. It has been continuously occupied by the first officer at this station, and has also been the scene of many large receptions. Nearly opposite to it is the square wooden mansion (50 x 50 ft.) built by Nathan Tufts, placed far back from the street at the top of terraces covered by grass shaded by a few trees, and commanding a fine view towards the water. The grounds, although reduced in area, are still large. After the death of Mrs. Tufts (1843), who survived her husband eight years, the house was used for a boarding-school, and was called \" Rydal Mount.\" Subsequently it was occupied for over a quarter of a century by the Rev. Thos. R. Lambert, D.D., rector of St. John's. Painted brown on the outside, it is now in fine order. Through the centre of the interior there is a large and handsome hall, at the inner end of which in the middle rises a staircase turn ing at the top to the right and left, and on each side are rooms of good height and size. All these parts are handsomely fin ished in the style already described (p. 87), and that was used, more or less elaborated, in all the eight mansions. The plate shows, from right to left, the Tufts, Commandant's, Devens (p. 88), Breed (dark), and Kettell (white, p. 92) houses, and Bunker Hill behind the last."], [144, "92 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. At a little distance, but fronting more towards the south, was a very long and comparatively narrow estate where Mt. Vernon Street and the houses on it now are, owned by E. Breed and divided and built upon in 1846. His house, of brick, ob long (71 ft. long), three stories high, with an end on the present street, is the only original feature remaining ; but this has been enlarged and altered. For many years it was occupied by Com. John Downes ; for several since it has been owned and occupied by Chas. Smith. Originally there was a large lawn in front of the house, while beside it was a greenhouse, and in the rear a garden and orchard. Beside Mr. Breed's estate was that of N. Adams, not as deep, but wider, and of about as great size, having the largest lawn for a long while, or perhaps ever, on the peninsula, facing which, and the south, is the house (52|- x 51 ft), wooden, square, three stories high, changed from the Russell Academy, for which it was built. For over sixty years this has been the homestead of one of the best known families in the town, and has borne the name of an esteemed citizen who long occupied it, Geo. A. Kettell. A former orchard and garden at the rear are now covered by recent brick houses. Internally, the plan is similar to that of the Tufts mansion. Thence westward for some distance there was no large place until that of Capt. Benj. Swift was reached, nearly opposite the head of Cordis Street. He bought the land (1809) of J. Noble, who had it (1803) of Dea. J. Larkin. It was a large lot bounded by High, Laurel, and Cross streets, now closely cov ered by brick houses. Here he built a square two-storied wooden mansion with a steep roof, and a gable in front, unlike any of the other older square houses ; as also unlike was a low piazza towards High Street, above which the edifice was con spicuously placed on the top of terraces ending in a wall that rose a few feet from the sidewalk. In its latter years, at least, the house was divided and arranged for two families, Mrs. H. Forster and D. Snow being for some time occupants. On the other side of High Street, and extending down Green's lane (now street) to Main Street, was an acre of land that for years belonged to J. Hay (p. 145), and that, like the other land"], [145, "OLD HOUSES. 93 along the slope of the hill, as well as on its top, was pasture, much of it until fifteen to thirty-five years after the Revolution. In 1791 Sam. Dexter bought the tract just described, and soon built a square wooden mansion (50 x 45 ft.), two stories high, with a low roof, and a cupola in the middle. Around this were laid out grounds that in combination of extent and elaboration have never been surpassed on the peninsula. There was a car riage-house at the corner of High Street, along which, farther on, was a high brick wall forming the back of a greenhouse. In front of the mansion was a broad walk paved with chequered marble tiles ; around the garden were paths covered with dark Medford gravel and bordered with box, as well as fruit trees ; while beside Green Street was a noble row of horsechestnuts. In plan and interior finish the house resembled that of the Tuftses and of the Kettells, but there was no side entrance, wing, or front porch, with which both of those houses were provided. Mr. Dexter did not live here a great while, but sold (1800) to G. Alexander, and he (1814) to M. Bridge, who died in a few months, but whose widow occupied the place until it was bought (Dec. 27, 1831) by H. Davidson. He, his daughter Mrs. Lock wood, and his grandson, successively held the house, the latter leaving it in 1883, and the A. Lincoln Post of the Grand Army buying it (1887). The amount of land has, however, been much reduced, Mr. Davidson selling lots for Dexter Row (1836, p. 145) for the Winthrop meeting-house (1847, p. 58), and to T. T. Sawyer and E. Lawrence on High Street (1850). At no time was the house itself in finer order than when it was left by the Lockwoods, and at no time was it a pleasanter place than during their occupation. By the writer many an agreeable hour is associated with the old garden and with the rooms of the mansion. By the Post the roof has been raised, and a wing has been added (1887), but the exterior otherwise, and the lower story have been only moderately altered. On the other side of Green Street is the place where the writer was born, where he has always lived, and where this book is written, bought by his father, the late James Hunnewell, May 17, 1831, soon after coming home for the last time from the Hawaiian Islands. Through most of two centuries the land"], [146, "94 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. here has been held by those who had business on the high seas. On June 17, 1775, a barn that seems to have stood near the lower end of the land escaped the great sire and was used as a shelter for American marksmen during the final attack by the British, when the former were dislodged and it was burned (p. 11). For over forty years the land then remained vacant, at first owned by D. Wood, who sold (1801) to 0. Holden. In 1817 it was bought by Joseph Thompson, for whom the house here was built, but by whom it was owned only a short time. Amos Binney, Naval Agent, one of the wealthiest men of Bos ton in his day, held the estate awhile, and sold it, as stated, in 1831.1 While he owned it, it is said to have been occupied by Com. Perry, U. S. N., afterwards the widely-known commander of the Japan Expedition (1852-54). From the first the place was laid out as elaborately as any in the town. On three sides were rows of horsechestnut trees that for several months in the year formed a dense hedge, hiding from many of the windows of the house all other buildings, except the steeple of the Har vard Church. Along Green Street the branches of the row there met those of a similar row on the Davidson estate, and made, for a hundred feet, a sort of large arbor above the road way, to which few rays of the sun penetrated through the dense foliage. At other seasons there was for many years, from the middle of the house, a view down Main Street as far as Dr. Thompson's (p. 147), and from one window a much wider pros- 1 Note. \u2014 An instance may be given here of stability in a neighborhood, perhaps not now surpassed within an equal distance from State Street. At the corner of Wood and High streets since about 1817 have been the Aus tin's (Wm., F. B., and his family) ; next on Wood St., for nearly 60 years, was J. Wilson ; opposite, on Wood and Green, since 1831, J. and J. F. Hunnewell; on Green and High, H. Davidson, his daughter, and grandson, 1831-83 ; on High, T. T. Sawyer, 1854-86, and E. Lawrence or his son since 1854; on ('ordis (adjoining), Mrs. E. F. Adams, 185S-86, on an es tate in a previous period owned by her father. Adjoining some of these estates are four meeting-houses, Universalist since 1810, Harvard since 1S18, Winthrop since 1848, and Trinity since 1867. It may be added that on the repeated repairs and alterations made in the writer's home the same men have been engaged, in not a few instances, through periods of thirty to forty years, and that for fifty-seven years the house has not been closed."], [147, "OLD HOUSES. 95 pect, for there, the writer remembers that he, when a boy, used, with a spy-glass, to watch the carriages on Winter Hill. From the top of the house could be seen all Boston and a large piece of the harbor, as well as the country to the hills of Waltham and Brighton and Blue Hill in Milton. All this view, except of northern and central Boston, is still obtained. Other recol lections of boyhood, clear to the writer, are those of trains of many sleds, or \" pungs \" drawn by two or four horses that he used to see bound down Main Street on winter mornings, to find in Boston a market for country produce that they had brought from the distant interior, even, they said, as far off as Canada. Frozen deer, looking a good deal like life, were perhaps the chief wonders that were displayed. At this time, and later, the Square, it may be added, was really a market-place, often half filled with loads of hay, firewood, and other rural products of fered for sale. The old four-horse stage-coach for Lowell used also to go daily up (and down) the Main Street, and many a time the writer waited for it in that old shop at Craft's Coruer, a quainter place than anything now, and as often he had a pleasant ride into the country. In writing of one's own house there is not a feeling of taking liberties that there is when dealing with the private affairs of others, so that in this case there may be a little more freedom used. Our house was one of the oblong kind (originally 74 x 25 ft.), and was built of brick except a wing that was of wood, and was painted white. Several steps led up to the front door facing the garden, and over the door was a low-arched trellis covered with honeysuckles and roses. In the beds close by, lined with box, were as many old-fashioned flowers as had room to grow, tulips, peonies, iris, Persian lilacs, London pride, lark spurs, pinks, and more ; and there were bits of hawthorn hedge, plenty of plums and grapes, and, in the sun by the steps, a fig tree that would bear something after much coaxing. One of the writer's old favorites was a red-berried mountain ash, a nice tree once in fashion, and there was a huge snowball, that made almost another tree of itself, and that was perhaps the last relic of the old parsonage garden (destroyed 1835) from which it was transplanted."], [148, "96 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. While the original brick walls remain, the house (entirely now of brick, 74 x 54 ft.) has probably been changed more than any other in town that has not been altered for business, or that has been constantly the residence of one family. It has been, indeed, although of course on a small scale, more like many of the old English family homes, plain but substantial, and without architectural character outside, but quaint or pic turesque and very comfortable inside ; changed this way or that, as use or convenience suggested, until it is evidently a growth and not the result of a single contract. Bric-a-brac and curi osities from many a country, besides books, and, still more, the charm of old associations, make the rooms pleasant, and the group they form thoroughly home. The most notable part is perhaps the private business-room of the writer, \u2014 large, oblong, rather old-worldish in aspect, with its red-beamed ceiling and two shafted windows filled with stained glass. Like a good deal of the house the growth of wants and circumstances, it is peculiarly his home-spot made by himself, for he was his own architect, and then librarian to form, book by book, a collection that gives the apartment com pleteness. Many associations with those who have been in the house linger around, and the books have many besides with their authors and scores of former notable owners and dis persed libraries. Outside, the garden, though changed, is still pleasant ; eight or ten of the trees, now grown very tall, are standing, while it seems as if all the old human Charlestown were slowly passing away. Still we and the good old home keep together, but the future tells us none of its secrets. Farther northward, between School Street and Salem Street, James Harrison bought (1799-1802) a large lot (114 ft. on Main St., 126 ft. on High St.) and built there a square wooden mansion, two stories high, resembling the Dexter house, but plainer, without a cupola, and surrounded by far less elaborate grounds. In front there was a lawn reaching to a slat fence along Main Street, and there were a few trees for shade. At the rear was a small orchard with a high, rough board fence, on High Street. Mr. Harrison died in 1812. Somewhat later"], [149, "House of Jas. F.Huhnewell \u2014 18ft 7 \u2014"], [150, ""], [151, "OLD HOUSES. 97 the house was occupied by Loammi Baldwin, engineer of sundry canals, and of the admirable granite dry-dock in the Navy Yard. In 1870 the land was divided into house-lots, most of which were built upon, but the front is still (1887) dismantled and open. At the head of Salem Street stands the wooden mansion (42 X 40 ft.), two stories high, that was the residence of 0. Holden (married in C, 1791), an active and prominent man between 1790 and 1840, preacher, composer of music, and extensive op erator in real estate ; indeed, one of the most prominent men in the town immediately after the rebuilding. Afterwards the Huntingtons and Twomblys lived here. Originally the grounds connected with the house reached from close upon High Street to Bunker Hill Street, but they are now much restricted, having been built upon from time to time. The house, however, for some years occupied by Thos. Doane, remains in as good order as ever. There was a wide view from it when few buildings stood in the neighborhood, as is shown by a print made as late as 1827. Although there were few or no large trees, there was a garden with fruit and flowers. After acquaintance, sometimes intimate, with most of the houses mentioned, and with their occupants, the writer has lived to see great changes. Already other houses once promi nent are nearly forgotten, and one by one these still spared must pass away ; hence, it may be hoped that his descriptions of them may help to show what they were. Here might be added some account of houses showing the fashions or requirements of a closely succeeding generation. The most notable undertakings in buildings of the sort then were of Harvard Row, of Dexter Row (p. 145), and on Monu ment Square. When the old Parsonage lands (Plan II.) were sold, the Parish Land Co. was formed, and on the tract was built (1835-36) a block of nine brick houses, three stories high, with granite basements, brown-stone doorway-frames, and pitched roofs slated. They were not detached, like the older houses built when land was in less demand, but they formed a block, the largest of the kind that had yet been raised in the town. The owners were James Hunnewell (treasurer of the Co. and promoter), Nos. 7* and 9 (he paying $605 for first 7"], [152, "98 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. choice of the latter, which is nearest the First Church) ; Josiah Barker (8); Shadrach Varney* (6); Wm.

Vinal before the finish replaced three.* The lots on Monument Square, although sold in 1839, were generally long unoccupied, a few on the westerly side being even now va cant. On the east side, in order from High Street, brick houses of three stories, and of an excellent class, were built by Geo. B. Neal (1850), still occupied by him; A. Brown (1853, occu pied by Col. T. Upham, A. Hollingsworth, F. Jaques, and T. G. Frothingham now there) ; Wm. Carlton (1861-62) ; Jas. Lee (1856) ; P. Hubbell (1846-47) ; Geo. W. Warren (do.) ; L. A. Huntington (1847-48); R. Frothingham (1856-57); all these built one house each ; and J. S. Small (1857-58) four houses. The dates are from Hubbell vs. Warren. On the north side, the first house (second from Lexington St.) was built by Dr. Wm. Gunton of Washington, D. C, for his daugh ter, Mrs. Budington. The last two lots were not built upon until 1886. On High Street, in front of the Monument, is the most expensive, as well as the most elaborately furnished, brick house ever on the peninsula, \u2014 that of Capt. J. B. Thomas. LIBRARIES. After 1715 there was a shop in town, and the only one, for the sale of books and writing materials, kept by E. Phillips (Plan I., 8), who was also a book-binder. His son Eleazer, established at Charleston in 1730, was the first printer in the Carolinas. It has been already stated (p. 14) that among the great number of claims for losses (443) made by individuals in 1775, there is no evidence of anything like a library, although forty persons lost books in the burning of the town. In later years, however, a statement has been repeatedly made that the Mather library was then destroyed,1 but the writer has been 1 \"Dr. Mather lost his library \" (Frothingham, 1849, \" Siege,\" 203) ; \" the fur niture, plate, and library of Dr. Mather were consumed in the fire \" (Wheildon"], [153, "99 LIBRARIES. unable to find any definite contemporary authority for it, and cannot think that this very important collection was thus lost ; indeed, there seem to be reasons for a belief that it could not have been burned in Charlestown. After the Revolution the local business in stationery was done by Allen and Cushing, who were the first printers in the town (1785-87). In 1819, in connection with his sale of these articles, and of school-books, appeared a Catalogue of T. M. Baker's Circulating Library, at 24 Main Street. There must have been 2,500 volumes, consisting of History, Biog raphy, Voyages, Travels, and Novels, Tales and Romances, as they were classified. In 1821, a large addition had been made, including a liberal sprinkling of sensational titles. At Washington Hall (Plan I., 86 ; Bib. of C, 46) there was for some years after Nov., 1813, a reading-room. Two reading (1S75), Battle of B. H., 44) ; \"a considerable portion, if not the whole, of Increase Mather's library is said to have been burned in the destruction of Charlestown in 1775 \" (Mem. Hist. Boston, I. xviii). Samuel, son of Rev. Dr. Samuel Mather, wrote (Drake's Int. to his ed. of I. Mather's \"Philip's War,\" xxiii) that his \"Fa- ther's Library was by far the most valuable Part of the family Property. It con- sisted of 7,000 or 8,000 Volumes of the most curious and chosen Authors, and a prodigious Number of valuable Manuscripts, which had been collected by my An- cestors for five Generations. These he considered worth at least eight thousand, pounds sterling.\" It seems to have been by far the most precious private library in the region, or in New England, and its fate is a subject of great interest. A question at once occurs, \u2014 why was such a bulky and valuable library, so great a part of the family property, removed to Charlestown ? It must have been carted to the ferry, carried over the river in a boat, aud again carted, and to a spot under the British guns. The writer has been unable to find any contemporary au thority that it was thus moved. Again, if then burned, and after call had been made for claims for losses, and 443 were made, including apparently every sauce pan and soap-barrel in the town, why does no claim, or trace of one, appear for this, that w*ould have been the most precious thing in the place ? If such a claim has been lost from the file, there is still the Committee's list without it. The only contemporary statement that the writer has found on the subject is in a letter by John Adams (dated Philadelphia, July 7, 1775) to his wife. He ac knowledges her letters of June 22 and 25, and after alluding to the burning of Charlestown, and then to the distresses of the people of Boston, he adds: \"The loss of Mr. Mather's library, which was a collection of books and manuscripts made by himself, his father, his grandfather, and great grandfather, and was really very curious and valuable, is irreparable.\" (Letters of, to his wife, 2 vols., Boston, 1841. ) His reference may be rather to Boston than to Charlestown, and he does not dis-"], [154, "100 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. societies also existed. Dec. 21, 1820, the \"Second Social Library\" in the town was founded, and the next year its name was changed to the Charlestown' Union Library. For 21 years it was the Athen\u00e6um, so to speak, of the place, its first proprietors being the members of the Ancient (1743), Ph\u0153nix (1795), and Washington (1800) Fire Societies, who gave their funds ($975), and of the Library Society, contrib uting over 200 volumes. Shares ($10) were also sold, on which there was an annual assessment ($2). Several hundred books were added during the first year, and in 1828 there were 2,500, \" many scarce and valuable, which if lost, it would be difficult to replace ; and some there are which could not be replaced \" (see Cat., Bib., 1821). In the earlier years an \"upper room in the southeasterly corner of the Town Hall \" was used ; subsequently the northerly one on the second floor of the tinctly state that the library was in the latter place. Mrs. Adams, in her letter of the 25th referred to (Familiar Letters, N. Y., 1876, p. 72), after writing of the wishes and efforts of individuals to get out of Boston (some of whom she names), adds: \"'T is certain they watch them so narrowly that they cannot escape. Mr. Mather got out a day or two before Charlestown was destroyed, and had lodged his papers and what else he got out at Mr. Carey's, but they were all consumed ; so were many other people's, who thought they might trust their little there till teams could be procured to remove them.\" Bright men as were the Mathers, it would seem to have been difficult for any one even of them, as a fugitive from beleaguered Boston, to have carried a large library across Charles River ; and if the books were previously sent to Mr. Cary's, they went to a house near the water-side. Richard Cary claimed \u00a31,560. on real (10, p. 157), but only \u00a375. on personal property (see further, pp. 5, 123), and the unusually large sum of \u00a39. 12 for cartage, showing that a great part of the latter, as was generally the case in that neighborhood, was removed; while John (287, p. 168) claimed only \u00a378. personal, and the name of Mather does not appear in the list. Furthermore, as is well known, a large number of books from the Mather library have long been owned by the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester, and other specimens are in private collections. The writer may add that he has a few. In June, 1775, there was a great deal of excitement around Boston, and as is apt to be the case at such a time, strange reports were current, some of which Mr. and Mrs. Adams heard. For instance, she wrote to him (18th), \"The battle began upon our intrenchments upon Bunker's Hill Saturday morning, about three o'clock, and has not ceased yet ; and it is now three o'clock Sabbath afternoon.\" (Life of J. A., 1856, I. 177.) After examining many details, the writer may here also add his belief that there are exaggerated estimates of certain losses by the burning of the town. It caused very great suffering, but, he thinks, less loss to art and liter ature than some have supposed."], [155, "LIBRARIES. 101 Swan-Hurd brick building (Plan I., 60), the latter a cosey apartment. By lot and sale the collection was dispersed March 21, 1842. 1 There does not appear to have been in this library, even under the favorable conditions of its formation, any full collection of rare works about the town. While the \" Union \" was, on a small scale, the Boston Athen\u00e6um of the town, the 3Iishau'um Literary Association was its Mercantile Library. Founded Sep., 1851, it was after wards, for years, the owner of a considerable Library of a popular nature, that was also, in time, dispersed. The earliest practical attempt to establish a Public Library originated in a petition of citizens, Jan. 20, 1853, and in offers made (Jan. 22) by Hon. G. W. Warren ($500), and (Jan. 24) by James Hunnewell ($1,500). Conditions in the offer of the former seem to have prevented its acceptance. To the offer of Mr. Hunnewell no such objection appeared, but no answer to his letter conveying it was ever received by him, and the money was given to other objects. After a while the project was revived ; a City Ordinance to establish the library was passed, June 4, 5, 1860 ; and a meeting for consultation fol lowed, on July 14, together with a general subscription among the citizens. There had hitherto been no room as well fitted as desired for the library ; but, says the first report, \" the re cent erection of the Banking House of the Warren Savings Institution suggested a suitable place \" for it. Of this Bank, four leading subscribers to the library fund were officers. A board of Trustees was chosen, afterwards elected annually ; T. T. Sawyer was chairman (and until annexation, 1873), four members were from the City Council, and five represented citizens at large. The first committee on the Catalogue (in cluding acquisition of books) consisted of Richard Frothing ham (a trustee 13 years), Jas. F. Hunnewell {8_\\ years), and Francis W. Hurd (1 year). The librarian was Geo. S. Poole, brother of W. F. Poole, L.L.D., highly distinguished in like office. In 1862, the library was opened (Jan. 7), the printed 1 A considerable number of the books were sent to the Hawaiian Islands by James Hunnewell, a shareholder, and the largest buyer at the sale (which he did not approve), and a fair number remain beside the writer."], [156, "102 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. catalogue was ready (Oct. 30), the number of volumes was over 7,000, of deliveries 58,612, and of takers 3,519 (all to Nov. 15). Five years later there were 9,897 volumes; 1,094 were rebound in 1867, 93 withdrawn, and 14 lost. Of borrow ers there was a list of 8,352, and from the beginning the de liveries amounted to 404,610. After annexation to Boston (1873) the library remained intact with its funds, in town where it belonged, and for this result Charlestown is much indebted to Dr. C. S. Cartel (librarian 1870-85), and Hon. T. T. Sawyer. Soon afterwards it was established on the sec ond floor of the City Hall. The number of volumes Dec. 31, 1886, was 26,428, and of deliveries (1886) 65,977, while the funds had increased to $11,500, and the institution is flourish ing. There is one department, that ought to have precedence in every town library, for which the writer urged contributions. It is that of all publications relating to the place, to the natives and residents, or issued by them. No one can tell what local or personal information can or will be sometime wanted or needed, and in the town library this should be found. It is disheartening to see all the last novels in such a library, and no care for a copy of a memorial of one of the best old citi zens ; to find the popular comic author from far away repre sented, and not the books of a man who on the spot did good service long ago. Calls made on the public early in the sixties would, if in any general way responded to, have secured far more than they did. A little later the junk-dealer was very suc cessful. A single pamphlet from each of two hundred persons (when 3,500 freely took out books), would have made a collec tion that could be secured now only by great labor, if done by one person, as it now must be to become nearly the success then cheaply possible. Yet Charlestown, thanks to some good people, has come to have this department fairly supplied. No one need, however, to feel that there is not still room for more, no matter how old or obscure seems the book or the pamphlet. The Sunday Schools have libraries such as the differing ideas of the owners suggest. In the High School there is a fair and useful collection, and books are also gathered by various Soci eties and Lodges."], [157, "103 LIBRARIES. Of private collections it may be said that a large number of families or persons have their book-cases, for these are com mon in New England. Of such collections long in a family, there are few in the town. The oldest of them known to the writer belongs to Miss Helen Hurd, who made it of service to him when he was writing his bibliography. Old pamphlets are preserved in it as they only are in a house occupied by one family for a century. One can but feel a certain due restraint in mentioning the private effects of others ; still it may be allowable to say that the professional gentlemen have had their collections for their own special uses. The Hon. Richard Frothingham, in his pur suits as editor, public man, and author, gathered a large num ber of volumes and pamphlets, that are preserved by his family. While, for rarities, he often relied on those owned by the So cieties of which he was a member, he was by no means without them ; yet he would probably have defined his as a working library. Another of our well known literary citizens, Mr. John Boyle O'Reilly, is also credited with having things good and interesting. As collectors (not putting them out of the pale as readers), Mr. A. E. Cutter has books in fine bindings, largely English literature ; and also in the sunshine of Monument Square, Mr. E. N. Coburn has a large collection of Americana. Mr. H. H. Edes has, in the same lines, had some of the good fortune that follows enterprise and enthusiasm. Of the writer's library, a small foundation was laid over a hundred years ago, when some of his ancestors saved a few books. To these his father, starting about seventy years ago, made additions, including a number of volumes now scarce. Beginning in boyhood to save his gifts and purchases, the writer himself has slowly increased his collection with refer ence to active or proposed uses, the nature of which is to some extent indicated by books that he has written. Naturally for such uses he would have not a few things that he has learned are hard to find elsewhere, and an interest in subjects and books combined has led him to obtain souvenirs of remarkable dispersed libraries, or former owners. In connection with libraries, literary societies of the town"], [158, "104 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. may be mentioned. Early in this century there were two Reading Societies, one at least of which became merged in the Union Library already described. Of what are called Reading Rooms, there was one connected with the Washing ton Hall Association (1813) ; another, called the Bunker Hill Library Association, was incorporated in 1854, and this and a News Room in the Square were continued for years. All of them, it is said, were centres of local gossip. In 1829, a De bating Society was formed by about 30 young men; a Me chanics Library Association, March 6, 1841, but of short duration ; and in 1853, the Mishawum Literary Association, already mentioned. During the second quarter of this cen tury, there were throughout the State organizations that might be classed with the literary, arid of which the town had its representative, a good one, long a favorite, \u2014 the Charlestown Lyceum, opened Jan. 5, 1830. Each winter, attended by a great deal of Charlestown, there was a course of lectures, many of which were by prominent writers and speakers, the Hon. Edward Everett giving an admirable start with his Ad dress at the 200th Anniversary of the Arrival of Gov. Win throp, delivered June 28, 1830. This was one of the few \" centennials \" in the town, not connected with Bunker Hill, that have been specially commemorated. SOCIAL HISTORY. The social history, important a part as it is of the history of a town, is seldom accurately written ; indeed, a great deal that is distinctive in its character, or even a simple detail of facts, is unrecorded. There is little or nothing, for instance, written or printed about the earlier parties where the local society was gathered, to tell how they looked, who was there, or what was done. Biographies and memoirs now and then tell something, but they are as apt not to be of use in this respect as they are in not giving accounts of what really shaped the lives of which they treat. It is a question, moreover, if private affairs, like characters in private life, are to be treated like matters of public"], [159, "SOCIAL HISTORY. 105 history ; still the annals of a place are incomplete without some account of its society, and a few remarks may be permitted. General statements are perhaps all that can now be made about society in the town during the earlier part of the present century. At that time there appear to have been few families established for along while in any one house (examples, p. 37), and styles of living, like the means, were simple (p. 37). Be sides this lack of permanence, there was also that of numbers sufficient for any large social development; and furthermore great diversity of opinions and feelings existed, as is stated by President Dwight (Travels, 1821, 1. 467), and in records (p. 26). Even external matters that helped to make later homes pleas ant were wanting, as a longer time was required for trees and gardens to grow into fine condition. A glimpse of earlier social life is given in a memoir of Judge Dana (p. 275), who lived in town from 1808 to 1813 (in the Kettell house, p. 92). \" He kept a fine pair of horses, which, in the fashion of the day, he drove tandem in a gig. . . . Some- times a town-meeting, when political affairs were under discus- sion, would become so unmanageable that the moderator would resign, and Mr. Dana be sent for;\" and when Mrs. Dana gave a party \" she baked about three times as much cake as was re- quired for her guests, because the married ladies were accus- tomed to bring to parties good-sized bags, and, on leaving, to revisit the supper-table and take home the bags well filled for the children.\" Some forty years later the writer has seen a survival of this practice at \" Temperance Levees,\" or suppers for charitable objects, given in the old Town Hall. Drinking hab- its, in varying degree, continued some time into the present century, so that it was hardly civil to receive a call, even from the minister, without an offer of a glass of something, \u2014 to the minister it would be wine. As late as 1818, a church council of 84 persons had at their dinner 9 decanters of brandy, etc., 40 bottles of wine, and 144 cigars, besides pipes (Hist. Harvard Ch., 169). The style of furnishing houses has already been mentioned (pp. 37, 38). Fashions in dress (except official), as indeed they always have, followed, at some distance of time as well as of place,"], [160, "106 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. those of town-life in Europe. A few of the earlier prominent men must have had an imposing look. Portraits show us Na thaniel Gorham and Samuel Dexter in ruffled bosoms, and text (Mem., p. 275) informs us that Thomas Russell, nearly six feet high, appeared on Change in hair powdered and tied, a cocked hat, and a \" sable-lined silk great-coat from Russia,\" while he carried \" a gold-headed India cane.\" The minister wore powdered hair and small clothes, and in the pulpit, bands, and a very full black gown (as did his successors, the latter until 1871). Numerous officers of the Navy, connected with the Yard, wore more brilliant costumes than have been adopted since 1861 ; and the local militia, and, at a later period, the firemen, used brighter colors, and more of them, than they have of late. At the same time there was a great aversion to dis tinctive dresses in most of the civil service, or occupations, and only in recent years have these become established, adding much to the usefulness and good looks of the police, postmen, and railroad staff. Towards the middle of the century, and awhile after it, a good old practice was continued, or was revived. Children whose parents lived in the town, settled there also, and the re sult was a fair amount of society attached to the place, and giving it character and attractiveness. How to keep near the old homes, and not how to get away from them, was then the question. Hence there were houses of parents and of children, and of many who were related or connected. Religious soci eties to a considerable extent made social groups, and, although these differed, all were pleasant. As time passed there was less of this division, and more mingling. The town also at tracted not a few whose value was felt in society as in other relations. There could, from these various causes, hardly have been a pleasanter period than for perhaps fifty years after 1830. A certain amount of fashion, along with a good deal that was quite as substantial and cared not much for it, has existed. Many handsome parties have been given, where, notably, or dis tinctively, dancing and cards were the favorite entertainments. Since society leaves slight record of itself, we should not fail to remember the ladies who certainly did quite as much to make"], [161, "SOCIAL HISTORY. 107 life pleasant, as did some of the men in politics who thus had their names put in type. Those who are familiar with the old town will recall, it may be allowable to say here, besides others, Mrs. Baker, Mrs. Budington, Mrs. Henry Forstcr, Mrs. Glidden, Mrs. Hubbell, Mrs. John Hurd, Mrs. Geo. A. Kettell, Mrs. James Lee, Mrs. Henry Lyon, Mrs. Susan Pierce, and Mrs. Geo. W. Warren. In the Reports of Benevolent Societies, to which the Bibliography directs, and on the Records of the Churches, is a far longer list of names than can be given here of ladies who have also been distinguished in good works. Among prominent visitors entertained in the town have been General Washington by Major Ben. Frothingham (p. 151), Prince Talleyrand by the Rev. Dr. Morse and some of his pa rishioners, General Lafayette by Colonel Jaques in 1825, and General U. S. Grant by the Hon. Geo. W. Warren. H. Da vidson gave a handsome reception to General Jackson (who is said to have been unable to attend). James Hunnewell enter tained (for some days) Haalilio when on his mission that se cured the independence of his country ; and later the Princes Lot and Alexander, afterwards Kamehameha IV. and V. Queen Kapiolani, and the Princess Liliuokalani (1887), and (1871) the first Japanese minister to the U. S. (at one of his earliest dinners in N. E.) have been guests of the writer. Two very prominent societies, the Massachusetts Historical and the Amer ican Antiquarian, have lunched with the Hon. Richard Froth ingham (whose son, Thos. G., is one of the few in town who maintain his father's style of hospitality). Twice the latter society has lunched with the writer. Some of the notable balls of former days have been already mentioned (p. 118). What might be called the society of the older period may be said to have culminated in the \" sociables \" and \" Shakespeares \" during the winter of 1881-82, when nearly thirty parties, all pleasant, were given, making a season perhaps unique in the town. Since that time there have been great changes. Associations having more or less of a social nature have ex isted during a century past, but during the last twenty or thirty years their number and memberships have very much increased, so that a list of them with their officers sills no small space in"], [162, "108 A CENTURY OF TOWN LIFE. the local papers where it is from time to time given. In each of the churches there is also an organization, or more than one, that is intended to bring the people together, and hence is social in character. Unavoidable change must of course attend the growth of a population from comparatively small numbers of similar de scent, most of whom knew each other, and where some families were large, to several-fold greater numbers, coming from many sources and having less in common. As the old semi-rural Main Street can never again exist, so also there cannot be, in the nature of things, the old and often intimately connected society. The moving out and the moving in that has continu ally been going on, has carried away many who were valued, and has brought more not yet as familiar. Scattered widely are those who in some way have been connected with the old town, numerous enough to surprise one, \u2014 some, as the world goes, to find themselves better off, some who can count their days on its ground their best. In the pendulous swing of Amer ican movement, change after change has gone on, yet still there were those who lived in, and stood by, the old place, and faith in the country and people, along with what the past teaches, makes us feel that the future will not in this way differ. In practical matters as well as in precious historic associa tions, Charlestown has advantages. It is near business parts of Boston as well as to a great deal else, and has plenty of sun light, good air, and drainage, besides a fair amount of firm land, put, as an old townsman said, where the Creator thought it should be. There is only one Bunker Hill in the metropolis of New England, and if the height where the embattled founders of the Republic stood life in hand, or fell ready sacrifice to so much that we hold priceless, is not prized and kept in due order, as it has been and is, another era than theirs and their children's comes for the country."], [163, ""], [164, ""], [165, "PLANS OF CHARLESTOWN. THE VILLAGE IN 1638. THE houses, grounds, and occupants are shown according to the Book of Possessions (1638), printed in the Third Report of the Record Commissioners of Boston, 1883. This Book is a record of the estates of the inhabitants acquired \" by purchase, by gift from the town, or by allotments, as they were divided among them by a joint consent after the General Court had settled their bounds by granting eight miles from the old meeting-house into the country.\" (Hist. C, 66.) With such means and authority it might seem easy to locate the houses and lands in the village close to the river opposite Boston; but any one who begins afresh will encounter an uncommonly pretty puzzle, and can well agree with Mr. Frothingham (Hist., p. 2), that while the Book \" is valuable so far as it goes,\" it \" is exceedingly loose in description ; \" indeed, as he adds (p. 66), that \" many of the descriptions are so indefinite that it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate the lots.\" Measures of length are not given ; often there is not even a hint of the size of an area ; points of compass are some times omitted, or repeated incorrectly on the same lot ; certain estates bound on possessions of persons who by the list possessed nothing, or nothing there ; not a highway has its present name or exact line ; there is no geographical order ; two important pages were lost many years ago; and, to add a little more perplexity, the accounts of the lots are scattered promiscuously through the volume. Slight help is given by previous writers. Mr. Frothingham has, in a general way, located a very few of the houses. The \"Estates\" (1879) is only abbreviated copy from the Book, with few attempts at \" the develop ment of localities which it is proposed to elucidate\" (p. 2), and then not always correct, though helping at a few points. Making a map of streets as they are from three or four plans that were on a large enough scale, and marking them with black lines, in"], [166, "110 THE VILLAGE IN 1638. order that the Plan could be understood better, the writer has fitted the lots together (marked by dotted lines) according to the Book, referring by figures on each to the page where description is given, and joining the abutters as there named, and as copied also on the Plan. In some cases lines coincide, or nearly coincide, with existing estates; in other cases it would be very difficult, or impossible, to make them. If it is necessary to establish this identity in any case, the only course is to employ a good conveyancer and surveyor, quite possibly with the chance that they will be either well tried or quite bafHed. This remark applies also to the second, and following, survey. The Plan, as stated, shows the houses and occupants and their positions with some approach to order and correctness, and, it may be fairly considered, gives a much clearer idea than has yet been given of the oldest village on the central part of Massachusetts bay when it was nine years old. A few particulars about the Plan and other parts of the town should be added. The position of \" The Great House\" built (1629-30) for Gov. Winthrop, and the earliest court and the meeting-house, and (1638) the tavern, is determined from deeds, and Leach's sketch (1780). The Parish Lands are from a plan made in 1835, and the probable place of the ministers' houses is deduced from their bounds. The Rev. John Harvard would probably have lived between them and Mr. Nowell, the first signer of the Covenant (1632); but the descriptions of his estate, like those of the ministers and of Major Wm. Phillips, are lost. At the north of the area in the Plan were three estates bounded S. W. by \" the streete way,\" and N. E. by Back St., Geo. Bunker's [36, no. 21] \" little house\" and garden, Thos. Caule's garden [73, no. 2], and Robt. Leach's house and garden [72]. This was bounded N. W. by \" Geo. Bunker's house,\" which the writer does not identify, and between his no. 21 and P. Pratt is land also undetermined. There seems to have been a nucleus of what was later called the Mill Village, half a mile north near the junction of Main, Eden and other streets, and another small group to suggest the later Neck Village. In the rural parts inland were scattered houses. At the east there were on that side of the \"back street\" successively from near Henley St., Eliz. Cetcherall's house and garden [60], Wm. Dade's two acres [22], Ed. Converse's [11, no. 3] \"acre and a haulfe of earable land by estimation \" (a favorite way of measuring the \" Pos sessions\"), and Sam. Carter's [15, no. 2] two acres of the like with"], [167, "THE VILLAGE IN 1638. 111 a house. From the lower (right) corner of the Plan towards the present Navy Yard, there were, bounded S. E. by the harbor, John Beridge's [19] house and garden; next Will. Stidson's [56] house and two acres, N. E. were a highway (or Wapping St.) and a part of Back St., and then, side by side, S. E. on Wapping dock, Thos. Coytmore's [28] house and two acres, and Walter Palmer's [31] house and two acres. Close by was Will. Brackenbury's [13, no. 3] house with half an acre. In the east field, on \"the highway towards mistick river,\" Geo. Bunker [36, no. 1] had two acres and a house, and S. on Wapping St. Will. Quick [70] had a house and garden, and Isaac Cole [76] also had a house and garden. Farther eastward, at \"Sconce point,\" was a row of four estates, all S. E. on the harbor, beginning with Augustine Walker's lot [50] S. W. and N. W. on \"the marsh,\" and continued by James Garrett's [51] house and garden, Steeven fforsdick's [70] house and garden, and Henry Larrence's [39] house and garden. N. of the latter two were Thos. Knowhor's [59] house and garden, and Thos. Moulton's [38] house and garden, the last N. on Wapping Street. There was a condition in Walker's [50] \"reserving libertie of way sufficient for the servis of the ffort,\" and one in Garrett's [51] \"not hindering the highway about the batterie.\" Reference is here made to the fortification ordered by the General Court, Sept. 3, 1634, to be \"made att the poynte neere Robte Moul tons, att Charlton\" [Mass. Records, 1853, I. 124], and that, with one slight change of place, was maintained, chiefly at the expense of the town, until the Revolution [R. Frothingham, Hist. C, 98, who adds that \"it was situated near Swett's wharf\"]. The village extended along the westerly bank of Charles River from a point at the inner end of the harbor, and also around the Town (Windmill) Hill. Northerly from this hill there were only scattered houses. On the Plan are shown 45 houses (perhaps 2 more unlocated), 1 barn, 2 storehouses, and 2 malt or brew houses. Added in the above account, N. and E., are 17 more houses, making a total of 67 (or 69 ?) buildings, all of which were undoubtedly simple, while the streets or lanes were narrower than their modern representatives on the Plan. Gradually the village increased eastward, northward, and over the area shown in the Plan, until its destruction in 1775."], [168, "PLANS OF THE TOWN OF CHARLESTOWN WHEN BURNED IN 1775, AND AFTERWARDS REBUILT. Although the destruction of this town in 1775 was, up to that time, one of the most important events personally known to the people of Massachusetts, yet no exact account of it or of most of the things burned, or anything that can be called a plan or accurate near view, appears to be now known, or, indeed, ever to have existed. General statements of course there are ; but in trying to form a clear idea of the extent and characteristics of the town, the writer found that it could only be obtained by a laborious examination and connection of such separate authorities as relate to the subject. These are, (1) the List of Claims for Losses made by a Committee in 1776, and printed herein, pp. 154-74; (2) a collection of 443 MSS., with details, often minute, of these losses; (3) a MS. \"Account\" among the \"Lowell Papers,\" owned by the Mass. Historical Soc. ; (4) a MS. \" Plan of the new streets,\" etc., 1780, \"surveyed by John Leach,\" at the office of the Secretary of State, Boston ; (5) the deeds at the County Registry in Cambridge ; (6) a Memorial of Citizens for compensation made to the 23d Congress, 1834 ; (7) details of various claims in the Massachusetts Archives, Vols. 138 and 139; and (8) the \"Gene alogies and Estates of Charlestown,\" 1880.1 No one of these, alone, gives any clear idea of the subject, or even of its details ; but they must be laboriously examined, compared, and arranged. The List of Claims (1) gives the amounts of losses on real and personal estate, but no details of houses, articles, or local position. The collection (2) enumerates buildings, in a few cases with great detail, but generally with little ; also crops, fences, shop goods, and furniture, usually with particulars ; but gives, singularly, little topo graphical information. In the Account (3) appear only names of owners or occupants of 76 houses, 41 \"Barraks,\" and 102 \"cellars,\" in all, 219 of these, or much less than the actual number of buildings (380 by church record), besides omitting a large part of the personal losses.

Main St. is shown impossibly straight, and only meagre information is given by names or figures ; yet valuable evidence is found about the site of the \" Great House.\" The deeds (5) afford the best of all available information, and yet sometimes leave the position of estates a puzzle. They are open to the public, and are admirably indexed and arranged. A portion of (6) will be found in (7), together with a moderate amount of curious detail. In regard to over three hundred estates the writer has ex amined (8) and has found many clews and statements that he has used; but the lack of topographical arrangement, and a scattering of details, makes it perplexing, and its references to losses are imper fect. The recorded deeds (5) have no substitute. Of maps or plans 1 of the town made later after the fire, there is one by Samuel Thompson, on a small scale, in MS.,2 dated Dec. 1794, showing the whole area, but no plan of the burnt district giving even available hints. The first real map of the streets, not made until 1818, was by Peter Tufts, but its scale is so small that it is of no help here, and furthermore some of its lines (as, for instance, the block bounded by Harvard, Bow, and Arrow streets) do not appear to be correct. It should be added that the early plans of the Battle 'of Bunker Hill, while very valuable about the field itself, which is care fully shown, and while giving well the upper part of Main St. and some of the outer roads, are evidently imperfect in regard to the streets in the lower, or chiefly settled streets of the town. Here the Plan by Lieut. Page is the least imperfect; that of De Berniere might almost be called preposterous ; Smith's Plan (heliotyped in the writer's Bibliography of B. H.), the earliest American, is based on that of Page. In drawing Plans of the burnt district of 1775 the writer has copied from several (fifty years or less old) that were of sufficient scale, although in this all of them varied, and has shown the district substantially as it is now divided, but on it the estates that then existed (many of which remain), some of which are accurately given, and others approximately, or with sufficient exactness for the purpose in view. In describing the estates he has named the occupants in 1775, and at the same time gives notes about their successors, and also about the buildings now or hitherto on the ground. It is, 1 The Town \"Survey,\" 1767, is text only, but its items afford some help. a In the Massachusetts Archives, from which it was copied for the^ writer. 8"], [172, "116 THE GREAT HOUSE. indeed, such a survey as we wish some one had made in 1775, and one that may be of value in the future. This survey we begin at lot 1, Plan I., the site of the \"Great House\" built (1629-30) for Gov. Winthrop, occupied by him, for sessions of the Court, as a place of worship, and then (1635) sold for \u00a330. to Robert Long. In the Book of Possessions (p. 6) the estate is described as \"one Roode and a haufe of grounde by estimation, more or lesse, scituate on the south of the mill hill, butting \" S. E. and N. E. on the market place, N. by the meeting-house lane, and S. W. \" by the high streete, with a dwelling house upon it and other aptinances.\" This house is believed to have stood until it was burned, June 17, 1775, and in it Robt. Long kept an Ordinary, or tavern, until his death (1G63). It is hard enough to trace the ownership of this \" Possession,\" but as it is the site of the earliest historic building within the present limits of Boston, we should make it an exception among the estates of the town, and briefly note how it was held. Robert Long's heirs sold the estate (1673) to \"brother John Long,\" whose widow Mary sold (1704) \"a small piece\" to Henry Cookery, and (1711) \"the great tavern\" itself to her son Samuel. Of him Ebenr Breed bought (1711) one half of the \"old tavern\" (1 C). Mr. Frothingham says that \" the estate [meaning all] remained in the possession of Mr. Breed's heirs [from 1754, when he died] until the town purchased it to form a part of the Square.\" But he owned only one half, and Charles Russell (1712-13) bought another half of the \" 3 Crane Tavern \" (D.), which passed to Chambers Russell. Notwithstanding this, it is stated (G. and E., 626) that Mary Long devised (1720) the tavern, and left it (1729) to Samuel Long, and also (do., 864) that Sarah, widow of Samuel Long, who married Geo. Shore, left (1744) the \"Three Cranes,\" occupied by John Gardner, to her husband ; and furthermore that Brown (Thomas, do., 142, called Nath'l on p. 24), innholder, bought (1746) of Chambers Russell the \"3 Cranes,\" and (1766) mortgaged it to the Ancient and Hon. Artillery Co., the discharge not being made until June 17, 1794. This not very lucid account of ownership is, however, clearer than the separate statements of the shape of the lots into which the Pos session became divided. Even the exact site of the first Govern ment building of Massachusetts Bay can hardly be determined until the exact position of a certain post in Mary Long's fence is known. Mr. Wyman says (p. 24) that the lot mortgaged in 1766 is the City Hall lot (Plan I., 2) ; but the deeds show that it could not have been, and the Leach sketch helps to solve the riddle, and also to prove the"], [173, ""], [174, ""], [175, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 115 correctness of Mr. Frothingham's statement that \"the Great House stood wholly in the Square, and opposite \" the centre of the present \" Waverly House,\" \u2014 a fact that he, it is very likely, had from per sons who had seen the old building. Confused by the first remark, but guided by the last two named, the bounds in the deeds become comprehensible, and other divisions are explained. In 1700 (deed, vol. 12, 656), Henry Cookery, \"marriner,\" for \u00a370., bought of (Maj.) John Cutler a \"messuage,\" \u2014 yards, gardens, or chards, houses, etc. (1 A), \u2014 bounded (but without feet given) N. and E. on Mary Long, S. and W. \" upon an alley or passage neer the public meeting house,\" and 1706 (deeds, vol. 14, 88), as an inn holder, of Mary Long, \"a small piece of ground\" (1 B), for \u00a340. (N. W. 54 on H. C. ; S. E. 54 on M. L. ; S. W. 30 on Town St. ; N. E. 30 on land and garden fence of M. L.). In 1718 (vol. 19, 260) for \u00a3200. his heirs sold Wm. Wyer a lot (A), S. on street 291 ft. ; W. on street from the meeting-house, 1021- ft.; N. on alley near do., 23 ft. ; E. on land of late Capt. John Long. David Wyer inherited (1747) of Wm. his father, house and shop bought of Cookery (1718), and sold (1755) to Jas. Russell, who sold (1759) to Rich*3 Phillips, and he (1764) to Irene Prentice (died 1791), daughter of Rev. Thos., settled minister of Charlestown. The bounds, 1764, are within a few inches those of 1718, and are described similarly, with the added particular that N. is on alley at E. end of the meeting-house. Thus these lots, fronted by the Breed and Russell purchases (C. D.), together form a block that could only have stood \" wholly in the Square,\" as is proved by the Leach sketch, quite out of scale and bearings as the block is there, and with figures of dimensions only in part agreeing with those in the deeds, yet there measuring only 5 % more area than in the guess-work of 1638. The whole area of the Possession is now in the open space of the Square, and not a vestige of the buildings once on it remains above ground. Charred timbers, it is said, were dug up here years ago. Close by the \" Great House \" stood the meeting-house of the town, and really the most important building there, in or before 1775. References to it are found, and its position, somewhere near the east end of the present City Hall, is known. Yet it is a strange fact, that an exact description of it and of its site does not appear to exist. In many other countries a building so identified with the religion of the people would not have thus perished from thought as well as from sio-ht. The slightness of its material seems to have been a symbol of the really slight consecration it was felt to give the ground where"], [176, "116 MARKET PLACE, NORTH SIDE. it stood. In the losses it (467) was valued at \u00a33,000. Near by stood the Court-house, valued (465) at \u00a3800., of the exact description and site of which, also, nothing has been found by the writer. The most precise information we have about the sites of both these buildings is given by those who knew them. Dr. Bartlett (1813) says that the meeting-house stood on the Square (in front of 3, Plan I.), and the Court-house in front of the Russell estate (do., 28, 29), which may have been on 1 E. Judge Jas. Winthrop (1818), in connection with Gen. Dearborn's account of the battle refers to \" the northern side of the Square, where the Court-house stood,\" adding that \"after the destruction of the Town, the places of the Court-house and Meeting-house were cleared of the ruins to form the present Square.\" Their probable sites are indicated on Plan I. On 2 appear to have stood the two houses of the ministers, valued (claim 470) \u00a31,100., and long occupied by the pastors of the town, as well as by Rev. Hull Abbot and Rev. Thos. Prentice. (As shown by a deed (1766) the former may have been on 1 E.). The latter owned real property elsewhere, and claimed (119) on it, or on something here. Neither of them appears to have lost much personal estate. The other losses on 1 and 2 appear to have been in those of John Wyer (14), Efhraiji Breed (48), and Ebenezer Breed (12). Next north, and fronting the Square, is an estate, 3, sold (1785) by the widow Mary Scottow. She stated (Coll. No. 2) that she lost her \"Two Dwelling Houses adjoining together Near the Back of the Meetinghouse,\" valued at \u00a3225. Matthew Bridge, who came from Lexington (Nov. 14, 1785), bought of her (1785) when the three-storied wooden house, now standing here, was new. Its front, clapboarded and painted brown, is about 36 ft. wide. As has been the case for over forty years the lower story is used for business and the upper part for tenements. In 1814 Ebenr Baker, who had mar ried Miss Bridge, lived here. She then inherited her father's large wooden house (Plan II., 44 A) on Harvard St., and probably then went to it. The estate is still held by the widow of her son, thus making one of the few instances now in town of an estate held by the same family for over a century. Besides personal acquaintance with the owners since the first Mr. Bridge, the writer knew the house well when a scholar in the \" Classical School \" kept in it by Dr. J. H. Holmes (1847 and earlier), and attended by boys of several well known families. Changes are so great that as far as the writer is aware he has been for many years the only one of these scholars who has been a householder in the town."], [177, "117 THE TOWN IN 1775. Adjoining is 4, a small lot owned perhaps fifty years by the family of Jos. Austin, who claimed (16) for loss (house and shop), and inherited the land (1784). He soon sold (1785) to Thos. Powers, who sold (1792) to Nath. Gorham, whose \"store\" is here on a plan dated 1796. An old wooden building here, three stories high, has (1887) been replaced by a new brick store. Next, at 5, is a plain red brick building, 43 ft. front, three stories high, and with a tall sloping and slated roof. The lower story has been occupied for many years by A. N. Swallow & Co., grocers, suc cessors of the firm Sawtell & Jacobs in the same business. The upper part has been used by societies and for business. This estate contained the mansion of Edward Sheafe, sold after his death to Caleb Call, and by him, May 11, 1772 (for \u00a3393. 6. 8) to Nathan iel Gorham, who, Aug. 29, 1772, mortgaged it as \"the house wherein I now dwell,\" to Jas. Bowdoin (for \u00a3200.). Mr. Gorham, who claimed (18) in 1775, died intestate in 1796, and his heirs (1813) sold the lot to Geo. Bartlett, who sold it in 1845. Long ago the house of Mr. Gorham (built after the conflagration) disappeared. It must have stood close upon the street, and could hardly have been a fine one, but it was for several years the residence of the citizen of the town who reached the highest official position attained by any of its natives. A long narrow strip of land behind, for many years used for stables, sheds, etc., extends to the open space on Town Hill. Beyond is another long narrow estate (6) reaching to the same space. In 1772 Thos. Austin sold it to D. Wait, who claimed (19) for loss (house, bakehouse, barn, shop, work and smoke house) in 1775, and whose heirs sold it in 1816. In 1796 his house appears to have been 34 ft. deep. The present building, quite different from the original, is of wood, three stories high, clapboarded, painted gray, and is used for business. Next, and reaching to an alley to Town Hill, and up it to the open space, is a large estate (7) bought by Sam. Swan, 1756, who claimed (20) for loss of house and barn. As a store it was sold to Caleb Swan (1796), who (1796) sold to Cotton Center, a grocer, who came from Woburn (Apr., 1785). He sold to R. Center, 1809-14, who (1818) mortgaged to I. Warren, and the latter's son, Geo. W., inherited it. The present owner is Rhodes Lockwood. On Town Hill are wooden dwellings, and on Main St. a modern style of apartment-house built of brick, five stories high, with stores on the lower floor, and three bay windows reaching up the other stories to the flat roof. This structure is developed from \" Wash-"], [178, "118 MAIN ST., NEAR THE SQUARE. ington Hall,\" in which G. W. Warren arranged a large room for parties. The \"Bachelors' Ball,\" given here by George T. Upham, Constantine F. Newell, and Walter Hastings, was one of the earlier, and was a fashionable event of the time. At the \"\u00c6thon \" (1861) and Quadrille (1854) parties were also gathered many once well known in town. Subsequently the place had the experiences apt to befall its like. Among personal associations with this estate there are two that are very notable. Here probably lived, although for a short time, Rev. John Harvard, and here Judge Se wall visited. The block (8, 9) bounded by the alley, Main St., and Henley St. was the home estate of Increase Nowell, first signer of the Church Covenant, who died 1655, and from whose widow it passed (1675) to W\"? Hilton. In 1706 Eleazer Phillips bought the southerly part (40 ft. wide), and (1709) his son Eleazer inherited some of it (8). This son, who died 1703, was the only bookseller and publisher in the town before the Revolution, but the works issued by him (see p. 264) are now of great rarity. The end of the Phillips part on Town Hill was divided into two small estates, on one of which is a two-storied house built of split stone, now occupied by the Charlestown Free Dis pensary. On Main St. there is a block of plain red brick buildings, three stories high, with stores below and dwellings, etc., above. The Leach sketch (1780) places on 9 \"Doc. Graves,\" and the Heirs of Cary (111) claimed \"for Docs Graves' house.\" (The same sketch puts \"Austins\" only at 8.) Three or four houses, apparently, were burned (1775) on this block. Main St. was (1767) here 27 ft. wide. At the corner of Henley St. and Main St. (10) now stands the large square building of the Warren Institution for Savings, three tall stories high, built of red bricks, with a brownstone front and brownstone \" trimmings \" elsewhere, and covered by a high so-called French slated roof with a broad flat top. It was built (1859) from designs by J. H. Rand, in no defined (but what is termed \" modern \") style, and is one of the largest and most expensive business buildings ever on the peninsula. Here a house given to the town by R. Sprague was sold (1732) to S. Henley. After ownership by him and some of his heirs, his son Samuel held the estate and claimed (109) for losses in 1775. Mr. Henley's account of his house is one of the fullest descriptions that appears among the claims, and is as follows : \"A large Elegant Mansion House three Stories high painted inside and out in the Best manner the upper chambers all plasterd five Rooms on a floer with large Iron Backs in every Room and Chamber (but one), that in my Kitching weigh1** Better then Two hundred wait,"], [179, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 119 The Best Room was finish* with very handsom Hangings which cost me about Twenty three pounds Lawful and Two Rooms with very good Paper.

Shutters and Iron fastnings to all the windows in the House in the best man ner \u2014 About three quarters of said House was built about Nine years before it was Burnt which I look upon to be worth at least Farthing \u00a32,000. lawful money.\" He was distiller, trader, church-member, town treasurer, father of 20 children, and the richest man on the peninsula in 1775. He was enterprising, and, if stories of some old persons could be believed, he had a vigorous temper. His daugh ter Elizabeth married Sir Grenville Temple, and was one of the very few natives of the town who had a knighted husband. After Capt. Henley's death (1795) the estate eventually stood in other names. Next lived John White, who had married Mary, sister of Capt. Henley, and who (198) claimed \u00a3420. for a dwelling and shop with J a brick wall between it and his house. Isaac Codman, who had married Abigail Foster, stated a loss of a store, chocolate mill, and personal, between Main and \" back st.\" and next J. White. Between the Bank and a narrow alley is a large estate (11), that for many years stood in the name of Bradstreet, and on Main St. is now occupied by a much altered, old, three-storied wooden building, well finished inside, long the shop and home of Katharine B. On the lower floor was the once well-known dry-goods store of W\u2122 Arnold, and later, for nearly forty years the bookstore of McKim and Cutter, A. E. Cutter, and F. M. Reed. On the former garden for a long while has stood another but plainer three-storied wooden building in business use. Leach gives no note of this estate. Sheriff Richard Foster (who died 1774) left his daughter Abigail a house on Main St., and Sarah the Bradstreet lot that she occupied. The former was the wife of Isaac Codman (202), and the latter of Sam. Bradstreet and a claimant (199) for a small loss on personal estate. Claim (123) was made for the Estate of Richard Foster (old"], [180, "120 MARKET PLACE, EAST SIDE. house where Mrs. Bradstreet lived). Half of a house here occupied by Sam. B. and Isaac F. (claim 24) was sold (1770) by him to his daughters. Mary Austin stated that she lost a house \" between Capt. Isaac foster and Mr. Richard Bouylstown,\" valued at \u00a3266. 13. 4. By the \" Survey \" of 1767 the house of the \"Widow Johnson \" appears to have been near this place. At the S. E. corner of the alley is a small lot (12) covered by an old three-storied wooden building with a store on the lower floor of the front end on Main St. Joseph Dowse claimed (116) for loss 1775, and S. Dowse bought here (1785), it seems. Adjoining is a block of plain three-storied brick buildings (pi. 13), on the lower floors of which have been stores for many years, and in the upper, dwellings or offices. In the third story, at the south erly end, Mr. Caleb Rand has printed for a long time. The estate belonged to Dr. Isaac Rand, who claimed (117) for loss, 1775 (house and barn), and sold the lot, with cellars (1786), to S. Dowse. At 14 is a low and narrow three-storied building with a plain front of hewn granite, built for the Ph\u0153nix Bank (in operation between 1832 and 1842), and subsequently used for other business. At 15 stands a four-storied building with brick ends and a wooden front, clapboarded and painted brown, developed from a quaint store of three stories, and used for business, as it always has been. In 1771 Joseph Dowse sold this estate to N. Dowse, who claimed \u00a3600. (352) for loss, 1775, and sold (1781) houses burned to Jos. Lynde. He sold (1783) to Joseph Hurd, one of the prominent local traders, who sold (1817) to Skinner & Hurd. For years, while the Square was a market-place of the old sort, and a great many farmers and others from the country brought produce there for sale, this firm dealt in it, and in groceries. Next east, where now is Warren St., the successor of the narrow, crooked Phillip's lane, Leach vaguely sets down \" Lemon.\" There was a claim (128) for loss in 1775 of buildings, on account of the estate of Joseph Lemmon, and one by Elizabeth (his widow?) (129) for personal. By the \" Survey \" of 1767 \" M\u2122 Lemmons House [was] joyning Dowse\" Land.\" From the N. E. corner of Warren St. to Warren Avenue, and from these points to the river, and most of the distance to the Navy Yard, swept the great fire of Aug. 28, 1835, still (1887) the most destructive in the town since that of 1775. On the Square, building was begun after the autumn of the next year, and most of the edi fices within these bounds date from 1836, or not long afterwards."], [181, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 121 At the corner (16, 17) was a plain, narrow brick building of three stories with an end on the Square, and beyond it, along Warren St., are five three-storied brick, and three two-storied wooden, houses reaching to Joiner St. At the centre of 17 stands the building of the Bunker Hill Bank, of brick, three stories high, with brownstone trimmings and a wooden cornice painted to match, and built to replace an earlier edifice, of plain cut granite, with three low stories, and arched windows in the second story. At the corner of Chelsea St. is a plain brick building of three stories, not as high as the present Bank, and beyond it to Joiner St. are several three-storied dwelling houses. EbenT Austin, who died 1723, had, about on the site of the Bank, a house (27 ft. front, 16 ft. deep?), and his son Ebenr inherited half and bought half (1734). After the death of the latter (1757) his heirs took it, and held it (to 1815?). Eben' also had (1723) adjoining a house described as new. \"Nat Austin\" is put near here by Leach. Nath!, pewterer, son of Eben. 2d (claim 203), had half a house behind the Town House, and Nath!, goldsmith, \" harlf a house,\" barn, and wooclhouse (where?). Mary had a dwelling bounded by Nat. and widow Welsh (who had a dwelling on Joiner St.). 18 and 19 are perplexing areas, but it seems safe to name Austins among the owners in 1775. John, Jr., lost a dwelling where he lived, valued at \u00a3500., and Ruth \" Harlf a House,\" valued at \u00a3650. 20, originally the lot of Maj. Sedgwick (see Plan, 1638), passed to Ward, Phillips, and Wm. Wyer, a part of whose claim for loss (210) seems to have been here (\"my house and barn\"). In 1784 Dea. Timothy Newell bought this lot and another back of it. Part of the back land was in the Gorham estate to 1793, whence it passed to J. Thompson, then (1795) to J. W. Langdon, then (1797) to G. Bart lett, then (1801) to A. Roulstone, who died in 1834, \u2014 an example of the changes in the ownership of some of these lots. Odin (John) and Ballard (Jos.), who claimed (211) for loss in 1775, seem to have had a narrow lot at this corner, 19 ft. on the Square, and along a lane, partly, it may be, on the area of Chambers St. (with(?) their \"well finished house & in good repair,\" 9 fireplaces, squares of glass 10 X 8). On the S. W. side of that street, at 21, the land was owned by Ebenezer Breed, a family in town from early in the last century, and losses here are probably in his claim (12). By one account 22 was bought (1755) by S. Conant, and passed (1814) from his grand son to E. Cook, and was W. M. Edmands's in 1858. By another account, Chambers Russell sold here (1761) to Charles Russell,"], [182, "122 NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE FERRY. who claimed (114) \u00a3650. for loss. Sarah Russell claimed (113) \u00a3491., and must have been in this neighborhood. She stated her loss of \"A Neet Mansion House\" two stories high, giving a long description. Leach briefly marks the corner \"Russell.\" During the war, ownership of 23 (R. Trumbull and T. Jenner, 1814) is not determined by the writer. 24 appears to have been sold by Wm. Stanton to R. Trumbull in 1779. Some of the following-named losses may have been here. These areas (19 to 22) are occupied on the Square by three-storied buildings, all used for business, and of brick, except at 19, where the fronts are of cut granite. On the ferry wharf {south of lower left corner of Plan I.) Richard Trumbull seems to have occupied a shop belonging to the town (G. and E., 956). He had a claim (2) for loss on buildings (\"wife's house\"?) in 1775; but as his claim for personal estate was small he apparently had removed most of his goods. Close by, Dea. Michael Brigden, who died in 1767, had a house (bought by his father in 1700), and an interest in a wharf (from 1733). For his estate claim (1) was made for a loss, \u00a3525., on real estate, but none on personal, a charge of \u00a37. 10s. for cartage indicating that the latter was re moved. His heirs reported a large house, wharf, barns, fences, etc., at \u00a3733. 6. 8. \"Bunker's WTharff\" was opposite, according to the Survey of 1767. (See 35.) The land, that seems to have been held by his family until 1829, has long been used for wharfage. Timothy Brigden (235) had a \" shop and barn \" near by. Wm. Manning's wife (227) claimed, he (a ferryman) reporting two dwellings \" be longing to me and wife.\" Thos. Goodwin had a small interest in the ferry estate (divided, 1786), and a claim (7), as also had Benj. (280), the latter having (where?) 2 barns and 2 \"shay\" houses, etc. Near by, John Larkin (4) had \"loss wharf, etc.\" (G. and E., 601), \" \u00a3 warehouse and wharf,\" \u00a310., by his statement, with \u00a399. 12. 8 personal (\u00a365. 19. 10 in claim). Martha, widow of Ebens King, seems to have had two shops, a barn, wharf, etc. near the ferry, about which she made a statement. Thomas Larkin had a claim (3), as also had Sam. Larkin (6), \"hous and back shop, barn and shayhous\" (?) ; the site of a house here he seems to have disposed of to his son (1776). The areas of all these estates have long been used for business purposes. Also near and north of the ferry were losses by Mary Cutter, also Wm. Conant (214) \"house and store,\" and at least part of a large one by John Stanton (216), he describing \" 1 large dwelling house near the ferry with other buildings adjoining 40 foot on the main street 96 feet on ye other,\" \u00a3666. 13. 4; also \"a"], [183, "123 THE TOWN IN 1775. large Home in Wappen cost me \u00a3333. 6. 8.\" It may be added that the whole area from the old ferry eastward to the Navy Yard and northward to Chelsea St. will probably soon be occupied by the Fitchburg R. R. Co. (See Stanton, p. 128.) Hon. Thomas Russell, son of Judge James (who outlived him two years), a leading merchant in his time, had a large claim (5) for loss in 1775 of \u00a31,750. on real, and \u00a3516. 2. 4d. on personal estate. Bought (1764) of D. Russell's heirs (for \u00a3600., deed 61, p. 612) and property long in the family, he had a wharf, land, and flats, extend ing from Main St., at 25, S. W. to Charles River. On the first were two warehouses, 60 X 20 and 40 x 20, and there was \" a large and Costly dwelling House \" that he valued at \u00a31,333, 6. 8. After the war he built a brick house (p. 88) on the area of Water St., between the present two bridges, but did not occupy it before his death (1796). The Survey of 1767 states that it was 44f feet \"from Cheevers N: W: Corner to the Corner of Russell's House\" (p. 125). At 26 A, extending nearly to the avenue to Warren Bridge (as that is marked on Plan I.), and then running 100 ft. southward to the river, was an estate where lived John Codman, sea-captain, poi soned at home by his slaves in 1755. Their trial, described by Mr. Goodell (see p. 280 herein), was among the most notable events of its kind in the Colonial history of the town. John (his son) claimed (391) \u00a31,277. for losses (mansion, wharf, \" wherehouse,\" etc.). At 26 B was an adjoining lot with a house that he bought (1771), and sold (1793) to Thos. Russell. D. Lawrence owned at 27; lot A he sold to R. Devens, B to Eben. Breed (both 1750), and in their claims (8 and 12) losses here are probably represented. Joseph Hopkins, \"waterman,\" bought (1725) the corner estate fronting the Square, and his son Joseph inherited part and bought his mother's interest. He, described as a \"hatter,\" etc., had estates on Harvard St. (44 F, G, H), and claimed (9) for losses. He is said to have been married six times within 271 years. Almost corresponding with the area of the avenue to Warren Bridge was the Cary estate. Samuel, \"ship-chandler,\" bought (1717) a house, malt-house, and dock, that he left (1741) to his sons, Nath! and Richard, and the former sold (1749) his part to the latter. By that time there appear to have been two warehouses and a still-house. Richard, who died in 1790 (?), claimed little on personal estate, but he valued at \u00a3600. \" some part \" of his loss on a dwelling-house with brick ends and four rooms on a floor, with a small shop at one end, an outkitchen, and cistern, and at \u00a3'J00. a still-house"], [184, "124 SQUARE; SOUTH SIDE. almost new, with a brick wall and two stills, a large wharf, and double warehouse. Adjoining the Cary property was a lot, 28, originally held by Thos. Graves, the Cromwellian Admiral (60 in Book of Possessions), that passed to the Russells and was long held by them, and finally by the Hon. James Russell, who had children, and who, like others of his family, owned a good deal of land in town, chiefly outside the Neck. His land here, reaching (perhaps 200 ft.) from the Square to the river, seems to have been occupied by a warehouse and wharf, as well as by his \"large mansion,\" 50 ft. front, that he valued at \u00a31,333. 6. 8. His claim (11), one of the largest, was for the total amount of \u00a32,501. 2s. As only \u00a3199. is for personal property, and as \u00a37. 10 is added for cartage, much may have been removed. His list in cludes a considerable amount of furniture, hangings for two rooms, silk bed canopies, etc., but no books, pictures, or mahogany. Judge Russell bought (1759, 1783) some of the back land of 29, the front land of which was a garden before an oblong house, with its end towards the Square, standing on 30 previous to the war. In this house lived two families, with a front door in common on the east side, between which and the garden was a passageway 6 ft. wide paved with flat stones. (See deeds 167, p. 246 for these particulars.) In the N. end (next the Square) was Capt. Josiah Harris, who claimed \"hous and workhouses\" (166), and in the other was Mrs. Parker. The widow Parker claimed (155) \u00a380. Josiah Harris, Jr., who had an interest in two lots hereabouts, claimed (167) for loss of \u00a3200. on buildings, \" half of a house,\" and a trifling amount on personal ; and John Larkin (Dea. 1st ch.), who bought here in 1759, claimed (168) \u00a3425. 10. 4d. for loss on real estate. He owned other property and seems to have removed most of his personal effects. Matthew Clark, \"boat builder,\" the year before the war bought part of a house and a narrow lot reaching to the water, and claimed on it (165) as well as for personal, including five boats. He and Capt. Harris seem to have removed only a moderate part of their personal property. After the war, on the garden ground already mentioned arose John Harris's house (451- X 41 ft.) of wood, plain, and three stories high ; in its later years an ordinary public house. At 30 was his store, a similar but smaller building used for mechani cal and other business. The two, together with the Russell mansion, were in poor enough condition when pulled down to give place for the \"Waverley House,\" a very large brick hotel erected (1866-67) by Moses A. Dow, extending from Front St. by the Square to Jenner"], [185, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 125 St., and much larger, indeed, than any other public or private structure ever on the peninsula, except, perhaps, the Hoosac Elevator. Abut ting 30, westward, was the estate of John Austin (60, Plan II.) . From 170 to 200 ft. east of Joiner St. was a dock crossed by a swing-bridge, broadening into a basin, and ending in small divisions that extended to the present Chelsea St., and almost to its junction with Henley St. At or near the head was a wharf, east of 32, sold (1723-24) by B. Green to S. Trumbull, from whom it passed (1761) to John Ivory, and (1769) to Sam. Henley, whose loss here, \"a large Distillhouse,\" ? helped to swell his claim (109). James Trum bull, son of S., seems to have had property hereabouts, helping to swell his claim (243). In the neighborhood \u2014 rather an unsavory one \u2014 there were two or three distilleries and a tanyard, that must have made it peculiarly inflammable. Thomas and Mary Welch, who had a claim, dwelling, stable 72 X 22, and shop? (207), sold (1786) a house and wharf, at or about 34, to J. Cordis, bounded S. W. 46 ft. on Joiner St., S. E. 159 ft. on D. Cheever, and N. W. 80 ft. on land of heirs of Theo. Ivory, who bought (1703) of Maj. D. Davison, bounded W. or S. W. also on Joiner St., which might be at or near 33. At or about 35 was a lot 93 ft. S. W. on Joiner St., N. W. 168 ft. on T. and W. Welch, and N. E. 142 ft. on dock, that (1770) came into the hands of David Cheever, who claimed (110) for loss in 1775 of \u00a32,176. on real, \u2014 here a still-house, cooper's shop, etc., \u2014 but only \u00a386. on personal estate. He had a large house, four rooms on a \" Flower,\" 3 \" stare \"cases, 6 chambers, 3 upper chambers, etc. (See 25.) This lot is \" where the distillery stood in 1775 \" (G. and E., 241). Richard Cary appears to have had an estate east of 36, but his chief property seems to have been at 27. On the S. E. was a J. Codman estate, that the writer has not deter mined. On this street no estates are even alluded to by Leach. John Codman claimed (391) \u00a31,277. (G. and E., p. 225, says \u00a3217.) ; but his chief estate seems to have been at 26. D. Lawrence is re ferred to here before the Revolution. There were four Daniels, and the writer thinks that he can omit this puzzle. Also in the neighborhood of the dock appear to have been the losses of Joseph Johnson (230), a large house and warehouse; Battery Powers (231), pot-house, kiln-house, and clay-mill ; Jesse Harding (43), the children of E.

A large piece of land between Harvard St. and Bow St., and S. of the double dotted line north of 44, was owned by Capt, or Maj. Thos. Jenner, a business man (distiller, etc.,) and a large owner and dealer in real estate, who died in 1765. Most of this piece was bought by him in 1729. The only plan in the whole block, N. to Arrow St., seen by the writer, is one of his \"orchard\" (1767) by Leach (deeds 68, p. 73) with angles made to fit a folio page rather than the land, for it can onl}' be made to fit there by altering them (yet using the same figures) as in Plan II. It is a curiously crooked lot reaching from street to street. Sam. Conant, a baker, acquired a considerable amount of the land, buying of Jenner (1760) B and D, and through J. Hopkins (1759) C, and of Jenner's executrix (1768) the portion of the large (1729) lot A to A. Conant held the latter and sold (1798) a large strip across the northerly part (and from street to street) to M. Bridge, who also acquired more land S. of this. Sam. Larkin bought E (1757). Joseph Hopkins (see Plan I., 27) bought (1759) G, besides 26 ft. front, F, that he bought (1759) of Larkin, and subsequently a small strip, H. The frontages of these three on Harvard St. are shown by their initials in brackets. D. Goodwin bought (1768) the part K, on Bow St., and Jenner sold (1760) the lot L to T. Mason. The end lot, I, appears to have been where Sam., son of the Capt., lived in 1771. Claims for losses in 1775 were made by S. Conant (215), who had a dwelling, large barn, and two chaise-houses (also a dwelling, bakehouse, and bolting-mills. See also 48) ; Sam. Laekin (included in 6), Jos. Hop kins (in 9), Sam. Jenner (150), a house, and D. Goodwin (in 148). On the corner lot, I, there has been (perhaps 40 years) a three-storied brick building, having on the curve a granite front with pilasters, the whole used for business. At H is a narrow, three-storied brick house with a swell front. At E is a three-storied brick house with a broad front, and a porch with wooden pillars, towards the street. It was built early in the century by Matthew Bridge, who came from Lexing ton (1785), and who left it (1814) to his daughter Sally, Mrs. Seth Knowles. After her, Gov. Edward Everett occupied it (1836-40), then Wm. Carlton, who owned it about thirty years, and since, J. W. Trull, and F. Childs. The southerly part of the lot, meanwhile, has been open ground, attached, and shaded by trees. At A B C was the large home estate of Mr. Bridge, long occupied by his daughter Alice, Mrs. Baker, and also one of the three handsomest old places in the lower part of the town. The ground, several feet higher than the street, was shaded by a few large trees, and most of it was covered by 9"], [192, "130 HARVARD, BOW, ARROW STREETS. grass, or a belt of flower-beds before the house \u2014 a half-square one of wood, with the front and a porch towards the Square. The interior was well finished in the style prevalent nearly a century ago. On a large part of the site there now are a court, and eight three-storied briek houses built by Moses A. Dow. The heirs of Abraham Snow inherited (1772) the estate 45 that he had owned for about 25 years, and his son Isaac appears to have held until the sheriff intervened (1790). Claim (151) was made for the estate of Abraham. Harris and Bates (292) claimed in the estate of his widow. Wooden houses erected here, and some vacant land, long in bad order, were (30 ?) years ago succeeded by three swell front, three-storied, brick houses on Harvard St., and a plain-fronted brick house on Arrow St., and (about 1865 ?) on the southern part (E. \"Welch's) Moses A. Dow built the large three-storied brick house (with a garden at the side) in which he lived, and died (1886). Dr. Isaac Rand bought (1741) of John Newell a large lot (on Bow, Arrow, and Harvard), and appears to have left (1790) the part 46 to his daughter Margaret, wife of Nathl Austin. A portion of Dr. Rand's large claim (117) probably arose here. James Brasier (141) appears to have bought (1761) from the estate of E. Rand, the lot 47, and to have sold it in 1787. (He valued a dwelling in C. at \u00a3163. 6. 8.) Somewhere near here John Nuting (157) appears to have had his loss on buildings. He valued J a dwell ing, \"kitching at the back sid,\" \u00a3100. John Bateman seems to have bought 48 (1744) with a house, and S. Conant to have obtained it (1768), and loss here would be in the claim (215) of the latter. D. Goodwin (148) appears to have had 49, and to have sold it in 1787. Edw. Powers seems to have held 50 between 1771 and 1784, and to have claimed (164) for loss in 1775. He had a house, barn, and shop, that he valued at \u00a3700. The lot passed to T. Harris (1787?) and was levied on by Woodward (1811) while (1811) Skinner & Hurd also levied on Harris on a small lot eastward. Bradish and Good win (285) appear to have had a small loss hereabouts. The small block on Middlegate, Bow, and Arrow Streets. Mart Furz, widow of Hugh, who bought in 1741, claimed (153) for loss of personal but on no real, in 1775, and was at 51. Daniel Waters (152) who bought (1766) of heirs of Adam Waters lot 52, had two dwellings that he valued at \u00a3600. He sold in, or after, 1790. In 1790, Jas. Frothingham bought 53 (on three streets). Of it, A was bought (1756) by Jas. Bradish (152), B by him (1755), and C"], [193, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 131 (earlier, 1736?). He lost altogether 3 houses, 3 barns, and a black smith shop. Jas., Jr., had a small claim (133) on personal. On the westerly side of Bow St., (at the upper part of the Plan) were (?) John Goodwin (145) with a small house and shop ; John Rand (146), and the estate of Thos. Rand (135). Joseph Ltnde (127), who owned in several places, had land at or near the end of Washing ton St. The Badger family had owned land at 54 reaching to the water, but on the street claims for loss on buildings were made by David Edmands, Jr. (139), on dwelling, and Richard Trow (140) end of a house. Joseph Lewis had owned 55, and Mary Lewis (160) and Sarah Lawrence (158) dwelling, heirs, claimed for loss on buildings. Somewhere in this region Frances Lee, widow, claimed (159) for loss of a house bought in 1766, etc. James Brasier, who bought 56 in 1761, claimed (141) for loss (see No. 47), and Wu. Hcnne*well, who bought 57 in 1750, claimed (163) for loss of a dwelling, four rooms on a floor, and outbuildings. (Wil liam, the writer's grandfather, lived three miles away. See p. 86.) In regard to block 58 there is difficulty in naming the claimants. Mary Hutcliinson, Mrs. Tuck, and W. Abrahams owned here not long before the war. Nathaniel Rand, ferryman, who had a loss (143) bought (1765) about midway in the block, and Tiiaddeus Mason (115) bought (1756) at the corner of the present Mason St. After the war the intricate operations of members of the Harris family extended to this area, as they did in several parts of its vicinity. (See p. xiv.) A great deal of block 59 belonged to T. Jenner (see 44), whose heirs sold (1771) a large, irregular lot, A, that went into the estate of D. Goodwin. Richard Devens (8) and David Wait (19, see Plan I., 6) also owned here. The land extending to the water, before the war ap pears to have been occupied by wharves, a distillery, and their attend ant business, and to have comprised the original lots of Johnson and Brigden (see Plan, 1638). The corner, B, passed to T. Harris, D. Austin (1795), and Isaac Warren, in whose estate it remained from 1802 to 1858. On it stood his house, similar to that of Mrs. Baker (44, A), and the two, personally well known to the writer, were the best of the older houses in this part of the town. The ground at B is now occupied by a three-storied brick building, and on the former garden stand two three-storied, swell-front, brick houses, years ago occupied by Geo. W. Warren and Col. T. Upham. At 60 was another Austin estate, held by John some years before the war, and (?) mortgaged by him in 1776. In 1824, Eben! lived here, and for considerable time later, \" in a one and a half story, yellow"], [194, "132 MAIN, NEAR HENLEY, STREET. [wooden] house \" (G. and E.), that was removed to give place to the billiard-room of the Waverley House. Lot 30, Plan I., adjoins, in the Square. From the earliest years (see Plan, 1638), Bow St. was lined by dwellings, at first scattered, and for many years closely placed. Be tween Washington St. and the Square have lived many well-known families. Among them were Henry Jacques (in a wooden house at 55, now much altered) ; Mr. Goodrich (56, do.) ; Thos. O. Holden (two storied brick house at 57) ; T. Harris (in a three-storied older brick house at 58) ; Joseph Hunnewell, and W. W. Whieldon (48, two do.) ; Thos. Marshall (in a three-storied wooden house at K) ; Gilman Colla more (in an old three-storied brick house at 50) ; besides others men tioned at 59. The street has, however, changed very much within recent years, and the back land, westward, is covered with railroad tracks and buildings belonging to the Eastern (B. and M.) Co. Plan III., beginning at the N. E. corner of Main and Henley Sts. The estate here (60*) has long been made prominent by a brick building, perhaps the largest of its date, and one of the oldest on the peninsula. Three stories high, with low, arched windows, and painted light gray relieved by red on the caps, bands, and cornice, it is still in very good order, and used, as chiefly from the first, for business. In the northerly end of the second story was the Union Library (1821-42), a sort of small Athen\u00e6um owned by shareholders (see p. 100). Here lived John and Abigail Stevens, the latter of whom claimed (122) \u00a31,504. for losses on buildings, etc., and \u00a375. personal property. In 1794 Caleb Swan, merchant, bought the estate (on which there seems then to have been a house), and (deed 134, p. 489) sold it (1800) for $6,000. to Joseph Hurd, with the brick store thereon, which for many years has been held by his family. Ann Bradish, close by here, re ported her loss of J a house, and a large quantity of furniture, as did Alice, widow of Ben j. Kettell. The next estate (61) \"was the homestead of Richard Foster, Esq.,\" who had a large mansion. His Heirs claimed (123) as already mentioned (pi. 10, 11). As farther described by deed (107, p. 480), the estate was sold to Caleb Swan (1792) together with a house \"built since his [F.'s] decease.\" In 1810 Mr. Swan sold to John Skinner (deed 190, p. 198) who lived here nearly forty years, and who was for some time a prominent local business man (see pi. 15). The Swans were an important family, who ultimately went to New York. Benja min Lincoln was one of the noblest business men of any family that"], [195, "133 THE TOWN IN 1775. has lived in the town. Tall, white-haired, dignified, he was a model of courtesy as well as of Christian character, in which he was not surpassed by any one prominent in the town for years after the rebuilding, while in wealth he far surpassed perhaps every other. The old house is standing, a wooden one, facing, and close on, the sidewalk, three stories high (the upper one of them low), clapboarded, topped by a cornice with modillions, but in place of its original parlors having shops on the lower floor. Adjoining is (62) a four-storied, recent, wooden building, also with stores on the lower floor. On its site John White, who claimed (198) for loss in 1775, owned a house. He has been mentioned under (10). North of it is an estate (63), extending down \" the lane to the Train ing field,\" that was occupied by Capt. Ebenezer Kent, who claimed (194) on buildings, etc., burned \u00a3739. The building now here is similar to the last one described. Winthrop St. leads across the old Back, now Warren, St., to the Training field (a short distance to the right of Plan III.). On this part of Back St., appear to have been Lydia Boylston (196), daughter of Richard (d. 1752), who had the \" old part of his house ; \" a portion of the loss of Jon. BRADisn (estate of? 295); and (?) John Carter (206) a house two rooms on a floor, and Hoppin and Samson (77). On the East side (?) were Eliz. Reed & Co. (335), a dwelling, and (?) three owners numbered 293 and 294. A considerable part of the land around the Trainings eld was used for some sort of farming. Isaiah Edes had a lot of mowing ; there was a Dizer pasture ; Peter Edes owned on the northerly side, after wards the site of the Almshouse, and now of Wallace Court, etc. Richard Devens had land, and Sam. Henley two lots. Losses here abouts were claimed by Susanna Wallace (248) on the west corner of Winthrop and High Sts., who had two houses ; by Benj. Brown (247), Jacob Burditt (246), a small dwelling ; and Thos. Harris (259), a house, barn, etc. Near the field were Sam. Townsend (254), dwelling, barn, etc. ; Wm. Caldee (239), dwelling, barn, and shop ; and, on a lane to the Point, Moses Peck (256.) The largest loss was at the corner of Winthrop and Warren Sts., where there had been a distillery \"over a hundred years\" (G. & E., 1064) owned by Jas. Trumbull (1750-83), who had a large claim (243). He lost a man sion house, and other buildings, and is mentioned on p. 125. Across the present Winthrop St., and at the corner of Main St., is one of the oldest wooden buildings now on it, square, three stories high (the upper one of them low), clapboarded, painted a dark olive,"], [196, "134 MAIN TO PLEASANT STREET. and capped by a cornice with modillions. The estate (64) was bought in 1757 (deed 55, p. 4) for \u00a3362. 13. 4d. by Nathan Adams, who claimed (193) in 1775 for a loss of \u00a3970. 10. 4d. on buildings. In 1783 he sold the land including a Boylston lot (196) for \u00a3300. to John Larkin. ' At the corner of the present Monument Avenue (opened here in 1867) stands another large square wooden house of three stories, higher than the preceding but not quite as old. Externally it is plainer; internally it was handsomely finished. For many years it was the well-known residence of John Hurd, but since his death it has been altered, and stores made on the ground floor. To this estate (65), as well as to the last three and next one, Leach (1780) gives no clue, and its transfers, bounds, and references, like those of 66, are somewhat perplexing in the latter part of the last century. This seems to have been the Lemmon property, divided (93, p. 379) be tween Dr. Joseph and Mrs. Mary (Lemmon) Lynde, in 1759. He valued house and barn, fore street, where he lived, at \u00a3533. 6. 8. Here seem to have been the shop of Wi, Grubb (228) who lost a dwelling, barn, and pump, and that of Isaiah Edes (42) valued by him \u00a366. 13. 4. He also lost a house (at 79 ?). Tim? Austin (307) had hereabouts (?) a loss on personal. Subsequently the estate here seems to have passed to John Larkin. On the northerly corner of Monument Avenue is a narrow, three story, brick house, with a store below, built since the Avenue was opened, and covering a remnant (66) of an estate now chiefly occupied by that street, and traced from John Cofran, who left it in 1836, bought (1807) of Mrs. Susanna Nutting (172, p. 469) to whom it was deeded (121, p. 250) as the \"Lemon lot\" (53 ft. 2 in. front) by Joseph Cordis (1796) an extensive dealer in real estate for years after 1781, mentioned under 109. Here, apparently, occurred some of the loss of Ruth Kettell (191) widow of Dea. Wm. (died, 1767), dwelling, bakehouse, store, barn, etc. She, with her children, sold (1788, deed 102, p. 157), a lot 23 ft. front, with site of a house, to John Larkin, and (1790) another lot, 20 ft. front, to Wm., son of the Dea., with the house he lived in. William sold (1797) this to Andrew Kettell (129, p. 483). In 1767 (Survey) Mr. Lemmons was 53J ft. from P. Edes (lot 84). The next two estates (67 and 68) are occupied in front by plain three-story brick buildings, with shops on the ground-floor and dwell ings above. These, like quaint old wooden buildings that they replace, have long been owned by the family of Andrew Kettell. William"], [197, "135 THE TOWN IN 1775. and Andrew (324), sons of Ruth (191), had a small personal loss, and part of her large claim on buildings may have originated here. Without solving the perplexities in references to the next three estates (as to the last three) it may be sufficient to state that they are now occupied by not large wooden buildings, old or altered. A deed places at 69 T. Call; the estate of Thomas (188) lost a house, barn, and shop. Lots 70 and 71 are marked by Leach D. and N. Rand. Deborah, a daughter of Joseph, inherited in 1769, and a claim (60) was made for his estate. Nathaniel (185) claimed (for a dwelling, shop, workhouse, and barn) ; and Abraham (350) for a shop, between this and the next lot, that he left \"for the commity to prise as they think proper.\" According to Leach, a passage 12 ft. wide was on the site of Pleasant St., and north of it was \"Newell's house \"(72). In 1766 James Kettell, a tavern-keeper, sold Eliphalet Newell half a house, and the latter at his death (1813) had a corresponding piece of property. He claimed (184) for a loss of \u00a3480. on buildings, reporting a dwelling, bakehouse, and large barn on fore street. He also claimed for a dwelling and furniture on account of his mother, Abigail. The other half seems to have been owned in one of the Rand families, and the loss of it to form part of their claims. Here now stands a low three-storied wooden building, much altered, origin ally the Warren Tavern, one of the first houses \" erected after the conflagration. ... Its large sign, which swung from a high post, bore on either side a likeness of Gen. Jos. Warren in his Masonic insignia as Grand Master. Attached to the house was a large hall, called afterwards Warren Hall.\" (Thos. Hooper, Ree. K. Sol. Lodge, p. 77). Here the first Masonic lodge in the town was formed ; here Dr. Bartlett delivered an oration (March 14, 1786), the first work printed in the town ; and hence went the procession to hear Dr. Morse's Eulogy on Geo. Washington. At 73 is another old, low, three-storied, and less altered wooden house on an estate marked \"Hopping\" by Leach (1780); but that Wm. Hoppin appears to have sold (1769) to Capt. John Hancock, who claimed (84) for buildings and personal \u00a3417., having stated his loss of a large dwelling, barn, small buildings, and personal, \"valey at\" \u00a3416. 14. 10. Just here, however, the List of Claims, as is unusual, follows the estates in order, and the estate of Wm. HopriNG (183) shows an estimate of \u00a3180. on buildings (see Water St.) Widow Abigail Ne*well (296, a small lot of furniture) is said to have been next to him on Main St."], [198, "136 MAIN TO THOMPSON STREET. The next estate (74), marked \" Badger \" by Leach, was sold (1767) by Stephen to his son, Rev. Stephen, the missionary to the Natick Indians (see Bibliography), who claimed (182) for \u00a3120. on buildings (dwelling and bakehouse in Main St.) but no personal. The existing building here, in recent style, is of wood, four stories high, painted dark, and used for a store below and a house above. According to Leach, \" Hutchinson \" was at 75. By the List of Claims, Samuel (181) had a loss of \u00a3374. on real, and \u00a3114. 3s. on personal estate. He stated that the \" house that I lived in, 5 rumes on the Lore floar,\" was worth \u00a3333. 6. 8, and that he had another house in Bow St. At the corner of Thompson St. (laid out in 1805) is an early three storied wooden house, with its end close upon the street, having now stores on its lower floor, and on a former narrow garden or front area. This (76) was the estate of Hon. Benjamin Thompson, long an es teemed and substantial citizen, and a member of the U. S. House of Representatives (1848-52). A portion of the land seems to have belonged with the preceding, and a portion to be that marked by Leach \" S. Rand.\" Samuel Rand (180) stated a loss of a barn and a dwelling. For some distance beyond this point, on this side of the street, Leach gives no clue, nor does he for a greater distance on the opposite, or westerly, side to which we turn. Beside a lane, at 77, is an estate (part of 106) bought (1773) by Capt. Eleazer Johnson (263) and sold by his executors (1808) to Susanna, wife of Capt. Eliphalet Newell, at whose death (1827) the building, since altered, now there, was described as a \" brick house,\" 40 ft. front. It stands close on the street and was two stories high, but the southerly half now has three stories. Here have lived Dr. Bemis (N. half), Dr. Bancroft, and before him Constantine F. Newell, a Greek who took that family name, and was one of the most attractive men in the society of the town at his time. Across the front of the next estate (78) stands a quaint, white> wooden house, two stories high, with a hipped roof, where for many years Catharine Carlton lived and had a millinery shop, in which she also had a circulating library, both familiarly known. The estate was held by Wm Austin (1821-42) who bought of Nancy Harding,' whose father had it of the heirs of David Newell, who died in 1770, and whose widow, Mart, had a claim (44) in 1775 (here, or in Water St.) At the corner of Bow St. is an estate (79, reduced in breadth by widening that street), long held by Amos Tufts (deacon in the First"], [199, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 137 Church, 1804-39), and still partly occupied by his three-storied brick house, with an end on the street, and a narrow garden in front. He bought it in 1796, it having been previously held by Isaiah Edes, a part of whose claim (42) for losses in 1775 seems to have been here. (See also 65.) He reported a house \"apprized when Grandfather died,\" \u00a3333. 6. 8, and \"laid out on it,\" \u00a3100. Sarah, widow of Richard Kettell, lived near this corner, and lost a dwelling (\u00a3200). On the opposite corner (Main and Harvard) is an estate (80) nearly covered by a three-story building with walls of split stone and quoins of block stone brought from the Outer Brewster by Gen. Nathaniel Austin. He bought that island in 1799, and erected this landmark, that may properly be considered a monument of its white-haired builder, who was for a long while one of the most striking and fa miliar figures among the townspeople, and who occupied a room here for many years. The writer does not know who owned here in 1775. Next stands (81, and partly on 82) a low and old three-storied wooden house, painted dark, but with a recent shop inserted. The land was occupied by Call (C.) and Burns (J.), the latter holding (after 1772) part of a house, 10 ft. on Main St., and both having claim 39 for loss in 1775. Hannah Burn reported \u00a3 a dwelling on Main St., and part of a barn, at \u00a3106. 13. 4. Hannah, widow of C, had a small personal claim (40), but she reported loss of \u00a7 of a dwelling, and a barn. (See 94.) Most of the larger lot adjoining (82) belonged to another Caleb Call, a baker (38-), who reported a loss of a dwell ing, bakehouse, barn, and store. His administrator sold (1785) 52 ft. frontage to Dr. Josiah Bartlett, who also bought (1791) the narrow strip on which was the end of a house. In his time he was one of the most prominent men of the town, not only professionally, but in Masonry, and in public affairs. He delivered several addresses that were printed and are now scarce ; the earlier of them, indeed, are very rare ; the first has been mentioned (at 72). He died, and this estate was sold (1820) to Dr. W. J. Walker, also a well known physician, who sold in 1846. His house, of brick, three stories high (the upper of them low) stood back from the street, and before it was an area on which grew two large trees. Though broad, the house was shallow. Since he left it, the area has been covered by a building, with a plain brick front, used for business. On 83 is a large, three-story, wooden building of considerable age, with stores on the ground-floor, occupied for many years, after 1819, by Benj. Haines and Geo. W. Little. The estate, that had belonged to Dea. Jon. Kettell, was bought (1764) by Dea. Sheppie Townsend,"], [200, "138 MAIN ST., HEED ESTATES. who claimed (37) for loss on real, but not on personal, in 1775, and from whom it passed to his son (1791), and from him (1793) to Dr. J. Bartlett. (There were a John Townsend, and John, Jr., who had small claims (36 and 344) for loss of personal property.) The large estate (84) composed of sundry old lots belonged, in part at least, to Thomas Flucker, a royalist, whose property was confis cated by the State ; yet in his name there was a claim (32) of \u00a3450. loss on buildings, etc. Rebecca Fowle (a daughter) and Elizabeth made out a claim for a house and barn. Joseph Hurd bought his estates (1785), in which the southerly part of 84 was apparently in cluded. The northerly part appears to have belonged to Peter Edes, who claimed (35) \u00a3781. loss on buildings, etc., but no personal, and who removed to Harvard (G. and E. 520), where he died in 1787. On the consolidated estate Mr. Hurd built (about 1795) the three storied wooden house still standing, one of the very best ever on the street (see p. 88), and kept a large part of the ground for a lawn and garden, both also still (1887) preserved. Along the next four numbers on Plan III., Leach's memoranda are resumed. First comes (85) \"Hurd,\" 34 ft. front. Benjamin, \" leather dresser \" (G. and E., 531), appears to have owned here for (perhaps 20 ?) years. He owned several estates, and claimed (28) \u00a31,695. 7. 8d. on buildings, etc., but only \u00a380. 11. lOd. on personal. His account of his losses (on four closely written pages) is the most detailed one that we have, and, with Capt. Henley's (10), supplies us with the best knowledge we have of a good house in the town before the war. His was a brick house, 57 X 20, \" with a good Suller under the Whole house laid in Lime with Brantra Stones. Three arches under three Stacks of Chimneys, also an Arch under a flue oven for Ashes.\" On the lower story (8 ft. 2 in. \" high in the Clear \"), were a kitchen, with fireplace, iron oven, 3 windows (24 lights, 7 X 9), 3 doors (6 panels each), and outside door, all well painted ; also \" 2 good keep- ing rooms,\" 3 doors in 1 and 2 in the other (6 panels each), 2 windows (24 lights, 7X9) in each room, with seats and four-leaved \" Shet- ters \" (3 panels each leaf), fireplaces \" with good tiles and a good Con- neticut stone before each hearth,\" closets, and \"each Room w-ell painted and paper'd ; \" also a shop with a large window each side the door (3 leaves each), these and the door having *'78 Squars 8 by 10,\" shutters, seat, etc., all well painted ; an entry from shop to kitchen, and one between the two keeping-rooms with a door having \"5 Squars of Glass above Head.\" \"There was 3 stayer cases leading up my second storey\" (that 8 ft. 2, clear). Front chamber, 4 windows"], [201, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 139 (24 \" Squars,\" 7 X 9), shutters, doors, and fireplace as below, the whole painted Blue. Two other chambers similar, 3 and 2 windows, and two small chambers, all painted and papered. Two stairs to the third story, where there was a chamber 21 feet long ; over it a \"cock-loft with a pitch Roof,\" and over other parts of the second story a \" Garrett \" with a \"Gambrell roof, hipt'd at the front.\" All the roofs were double boarded, and shingled. The yard beside the house was paved 10 ft. wide, and around the land, up the Hill, was a stone wall 7 ft. high. In the yard was a cistern (700 galls.) a pump, and a Breeches-maker's shop (12 X 10) plastered, and with 3 windows. Up the hill were a barn (25 X 15), and a work-house (30 X 14) with two stories and a cellar. An old, quaint house, of wood and brick, that stood here endwise on the street and faced a narrow area on which grew a large willow-tree, was for many years occupied by his grandson, Dr. J. Stearns Hurd, who was long well known in Charlestown society, as also was his ac complished wife. A four-storied apartment-house of brick, with stores on the first floor and two metal bay-windows extending through the three stories above to the flat roof, has been built (1886-87) over this estate by Jos. Gahm. 86 and 87, marked by Leach \" Boylston,\" 48 ft. front, appear to have been held by a family of that name after 1742, and to have been inherited (1807) by Thomas from his father, Richard, who claimed (27) \u00a3774., stating the loss of a mansion, barn, \"colehouse,\" and several minor buildings, but little on personal estate. In 1813 Joseph Hurd bought of Thomas, and sold (1813) a lot (86) to the Washington Hall Association. On it was erected the existing three storied brick building occupied by S. Kidder & Co., and successors, druggists, a firm dating from 1804, and one of the very oldest and best known in the town. The association (50 shares subscribed by 34 per sons, annual payment $5) had for some time on the 2d floor a reading room, where (the writer has been told) there was a great deal of local gossip. A long note about the Hall is in the writer's Bibliography (p. 46). At 87 there is now an old, low, three-storied wooden building, with shops on the lower floor. A similar, but larger, building stands on 88. Somewhere here is the 20 ft. front marked by Leach \"Austin.\" Mart, the name of the widow of Ebenezer, had a claim (21) for a loss of end of a \" duble house in fore street,\" and a blacksmith's shop back of it. She sold (1789 ?) a lot 22 ft. on the street, and 84 or 89 ft. N. W. on R. Boylston (G. and E., 30), that seems to fit upon number 87 of the plan. The present corner lot, 88, that must have included part of the exist-"], [202, "140 MAIN ST.; TOWN HILL. ing Henley St., is assigned by Leach to \" Foster.\" Capt. Isaac, who died in 1781, held a good deal of real estate, and claimed (24) for a mansion, barn, storehouse, and chocolate mill. He seems to have had this lot, which was sold (1800) by the heirs of his son Isaac, a distinguished physician, who died in 1782, and who had a claim (313) of \u00a3139 for apothecary's stock left in the house and stable. An estate with 17 ft. front, marked by Leach \" Edes,\" must have been on the present Henley St. along with a part of 88. Huldah Edes, who had a lot with a house that corresponds (89), and that had been several years under mortgage, claimed (23) for loss in 1775. Dotted lines here on the plan show the site proposed (1780) for the meeting-house when the town was rebuilt, and, on the hill, other dotted lines show where it was built and stood (1783-1833), while full lines show the place of its brick successor (1833-87) described on page 53. At 90 is a small lot, for many years occupied by a barn in bad condi tion, but now by two good brick houses built by Jos. Gahm. At the corner (on 84) Dea. John Frothingham owned a small barn. The outline at 91 shows the form of the old brick town-schoolhouse, re placed (1847-8) by a larger brick edifice extending farther north, and of three stories, with granite trimmings. Here, or very near here, there appears to have been a schoolhouse from early times, one being mentioned in a deed in 1659, and here was probably one of the two schoolhouses burned, mentioned (466) among the losses in 1775. There is a similar reference to a county jail (1767). (G. and E., 206, not in index.) The scarcity of even any allusion to the definite site of the public buildings is remarkable ; that of the meeting-house is obtained from a private plan, the only authority known to the writer. Before 1795 the area 92 appears to have been Town land, some of it forming the yard of the county jail. In 1813, Jos. Hurd bought a considerable part, now occupied by a two-storied wooden building, old and quaint. At the back of the next lot (83) is an old brick building of two stories, for many years in poor condition, as also has been the rear of 82 and 81. On the wedge-shaped block along the other side of the northerly slope of the hill, the cross lines should perhaps be put a little farther towards Main St. At the point (93) there has been for a long time a small single-storied building of wood, used for one kind of business or an other, and now extending northward only to the black line. James Bradish bought this lot of the Town in 1732, and sold it to the Town in 1790, and part of his claim (132) for loss in 1775 (of blacksmith shop and stock) may have originated here."], [203, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 141 At 94 a part of a house was bought by John Burn in 1772, while the other part remained occupied by the widow Hannah Call who had a small loss (40) of personal estate. Call and Burns (39) had a claim (81) on Main St., and the \u00a7 of a house and a barn may have been here. Caleb Call, son of Thos., had 95, and claim 38 (dwelling, bake house, barn, and store) may also have been in part based here. Here stands an old, low, three-storied wooden house, capped by a cornice with modillions, and arranged for two families. In the upper half lived Thos. B. Wyman, the genealogist. Northward is a small garden (partly on 94?), and southward are two two-storied wooden houses covering a former garden belonging to the old house. Richard Hunnewell's estate covered 96 and 97, the former bought in 1738 and the latter in 1744, making a frontage of 114 feet. He claimed (137) for a house, shop, stock, and furniture in 1775, and sold the land in 1782. Here now stand four three-storied brick houses with swell fronts, and (across the north end) an old, two storied wooden house, with a hipped roof. (The old homestead of the writer's grandfather was three miles out of town.) Ephraim Osburn appears to have bought 98 in 1746, and to have held it at the Revolution. He died (in 1783?) and his widow sold (1783) to Dea. David Goodwin. Claim (154) was made for the estate of Eph. Osbourn. John Center bought lot 99 in 1726, and M. Bridge (who came to town in 1785) sold it in 1793. The lot 100 reaching to Arrow St. belonged to B. Davis (in 1725?) and as a garden was sold (1765) by him to Setii Sweetser, who lost a dwelling and claimed (219), and whose heirs sold by 1795. Some part here seems to have passed to James Davis (son of B.), whose widow Sarah lost half a dwelling and claimed (156). On the hill at the corner of Arrow St. (parts of 99 and 100) was a garden, and, facing it, an old, white, wooden house, which, like the garden, was small but quaint and well kept. These three lots (98, 99, 100) are now occupied by three brick houses, three stories high, forming part of Moses A. Dow's large estate between here and Warren Avenue. At the north end of the block between Prescott St. and Bow {now Devens) St., 101 was bought (1701) by Stephen Kidder, and by his grandson John sold (1803) to J. C. Edmands. John inherited in 1770, and claimed (136) for a loss of a shop and end of a house. Jacob Rhodes had been taxed on property in town for many years before the Revolution. He and his son Jacob were shipwrights (see p. 127) ; the latter sold (1803) estate (102) to J. C. Edmands (57\u00a3 ft."], [204, "142 PEESCOTT AND BOW STS. on Middlegate St., and 49\u00a3 ft. on Bow St.). Here may have been a dwelling on which was part of their loss (284), one of half a dozen buildings that they owned. On this Edmands property are now a three-storied brick house (the upper story low), old, but painted and in good order, standing at the corner, and southward, a three-storied, recent, wooden house, painted a dark color. On 103 are now two similar houses. Richard Devens, who died in 1807, owned here (?) and a large lot between the two streets (100 ft. on Bow St.) forming a considerable part of the\" area (104) now occu pied by the Harvard schoolhouse, a high, three-storied building of red brick, with pressed brick facings and granite trimmings, not in one of the old defined styles, yet with dignity, picturesqueness, and better effect than municipal art sometimes secures. Dedicated Feb. 22, 1872, it cost $130,285, and has room for about 800 scholars. (Plans and view in School Report, 1872.) At the southerly end of this area Nathaniel Phillips bought (1762-66) a house and land of the heirs of E. Dowse, and claimed (134) for a loss on a dwelling (2 rooms on a floor, and 2 chimneys), and a barn 24 X 18. On the north side of Bow St. 105 was bought (1756) of Isaac Johnson's administratrix by David Newell, whose widow Mary claimed (44). She is mentioned (78), and p. 127 (Water St.) Mary Wilcott (45), widow, claimed for a house. His heirs sold (1786) to Stephen Bruce, husband of his daughter. 106 was sold (1773) by Isaac Johnson's heirs to Mercy Wolcut, Walcot, or Willcut, and by her (1773) to Capt. Eleazer Johnson, who seems to have held it until his death (1807). It was a large [~ shaped lot reaching to Main St., the easterly arm of which formed 77 on this plan. 107 formed part of a large lot bought on mortgage (1772), with a house, by Jonathan Fowle of Providence, and sold to Josiah Bartlett (1795), and by him (1795) to Capt. A. McNeil, who for some years dealt largely in real estate in the town, although he is said to have lived in New York (G. and E. p. 645). He sold (1798) this land (41 ft. on Bow St., and 118 ft. deep) to James Frothingham. Jon. Fowle claimed (161) for loss of \u00a380. on a small house. On these three lots there now are wooden houses, except on the westerly part of 107 bought to protect St. John's Church, and occupied by its pictur esque wooden chapel. On 108, another part of the Fowle lot, stands the church itself, described on page 59."], [205, ""], [206, ""], [207, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 143 Plan IV. Main St., north of Thompson St., northeast side. The large estate 109, as a part of Katharine Phipps's garden, was sold (1752) to Jas. Gardner and others, and at once divided into irregular parts, he taking one of them, and D. Wyer and Jos. Rand the others. A claim (178) was made for his estate on account of losses on buildings of \u00a3600., but only \u00a330. for personal. He had val ued a house, barn, and workhouse, at \u00a3666. 8. 4. His administrator sold (1780) a considerable area to D. Wood, Jr., who traded in land in this neighborhood, and soon sold (1780) to Capt. Joseph Cordis, formerly a shipmaster and then a merchant. The latter also bought (1781) a lot hereabouts of Jos. Frothingham (who had claim 59) and (1801) mortgaged the house where he lived, and store, with land extending 135 ft. on Main St. and 116 ft. on Back St. Capt. Cordis, said Mr. Thos. Hooper, \"was among the first in town to engage in mercantile pursuits on what was then considered a large scale.\" His house, now standing nearly opposite Union St., is a square, low, three storied, wooden one, in the first story of which shops have been in serted. Capt. Cordis owned land back to High St., and through it the street named after him was made in 1799. In the wars between France and England he, like others here, suffered badly, and probably on this account his death was hastened. From this house to the corner of Thompson St. are old brick buildings of three stories, with stores below and dwellings aboVe. In the one next Capt. Cordis's, S. C. Armstrong had his printing works (1810-11). Next northward for many years stood a low two-storied building extending from street to street and occupied for a grocery store by two well-known citizens, Wm. and Sam. Abbot. On its site is now a three-storied brick build ing, with store below and dwellings above, owned by Mr. Klous. Hereabouts, also, stood the distillery of Wm. and David Wyer (1735 52) that passed through mortgage to Gov. Jas. Bowdoin, and Isaac Rand, with complications it is not here necessary to consider. At 110, Anne (Rand), widow of John Rayner, left (1774) a house valued at \u00a31,500. to her children, who claimed for losses in 1775; Thomas (172), house, etc.; James (174), furniture (he lived in Dea. Cheever's house) ; and Ann (173), \\ a shop. Isaac (255) had an interest in the estate. In 1812, Ann, who ultimately inherited all, devised to Maryr wife of Gee. Bartlett Here there is now a two storied wooden building used for business, including for some forty years a store for lamps and gas-fixtures kept by L. F. Whitney, F. A. Titus, and G. S. Poole. Across a narrow alley (now closed) that extended from street to"], [208, "144 MAIN ST. ; CKAFT'S CORNER. street is (1887) a large, new, four-storied, wooden building with shops on the first floor, and forming (at the black line on the plan) a part of the south side of Thompson Square (another Boston \" square \" without a right angle to it). The old estates, however, extended (as shown by dotted lines) farther north. In 1702 N. Heaton bought 111 and 112, and sold (1723) Jon. Rand, who sold (1725-26) the latter to E. Bennett, and he (1740) Jas. Hay. Jas. sold it (1765) to his son John, of whose large estate, and claim (74) for two houses, bakehouse (2 ovens), \" shaise \" house, etc., it appears to have formed a part. Jon. Rand held 111 until his death (1760), when his heirs sold half the house to his son, Rev. Nehemiah, who (?) claimed (175) for a mansion with 7 \"smokes,\" a hatter's shop, and barn. His widow and administratrix sold (1765) the other part to his son Thomas, who claimed (176) for a house, workshop, and barn. Es ther Rand, widow of Jon., another son, claimed (177) for furniture. From the first rebuilding in the town until recently, the house that stood at the corner, 113, was one of the most notable landmarks in the central parts of Charlestown. Its site is now wholly within the area of Thompson Square, and a post there bearing an electric light may be considered its monument. It was a long, narrow, wooden building of two stories, with a gable at the end, and a roof sloping towards each street. For many years Mrs. Mercy Boylston lived in the southerly end and upstairs, and on the first floor at the other end Elias Crafts kept a druggist's store, and hence the place got the name of \" Crafts' Corner.\" According to Mr. Cutter (Centennial Reminiscences, 1875), and information in the Hay family, the house was the first erected at the rebuilding of the town. As was the case with 112, this estate belonged to John Hay, and formed part of his claim (74). He had it (1763) of his father, who (1724-25) of Jon. Rand, who (1723) of N. Heaton, who (1702) of Joseph Phipps. In 1802 John Hay left the estate to his son Wm., who died in 1813, and his daughter Mercy (Boylston), who lived until 1849. The block 109-113 appears to have been chiefly pasture early in the 18th century, garden about the middle of it, and at the Revolution somewhat closely built upon. Almost every foot of the land is now covered by a roof. The land to the east and north of Warren St., on Plan IV., ap pears to have been chiefly pasture until about 1800. Cordis St. and Pleasant St. were opened through it in 1799, and better access was given to the former in 1805 by laying out Thompson St. From the existing passage to the Universalist meeting-house to"], [209, "145 THE TOWN IN 1775. Green St., and along that to High St., and also bounded 164 ft. on the latter, was a lot of an acre and a half that John Hay bought (1752) of John Phillips, a sea-captain, son of Col. Judge John Phillips. It was described \u00bbs Hay's pasture as late as 1791, when he sold Samuel Dexter one acre, the part on Green St. and High St., with 96 ft. front on Main St. This became the handsomest, and perhaps largest, early post-revolutionary place on the peninsula, and is described on p. 93. John Hay owned several lots of real estate, and claimed (74) for losses. Of him, Capt. J. Cordis (and others?), Timothy Thompson had acquired after the Revolution, and by 1799, land from Cordis St. to 116, buying 114 in 1803, and 115 in 1799, both from the Hays. The latter and part of the former were sold by his heirs (1874) to the Five Cent Savings Bank. His old and low two-storied house with an end on the street, and a row of little, quaint, similar houses fronting the passage to the church, all of them painted a dingy white, were pulled down, and the existing bank building was erected, one of the largest and the handsomest business structures ever in the town. It is of brick, with a front of pale olive stone, and has a flat roof with a sharp pitch towards the streets, and large dormer windows. The style may perhaps be called eclectic Gothic. On the lower floor are three stores ; on the second are the rooms of the Savings Bank, the Monument Bank, and Charlestown Gas Co. Nowhere else in Boston will there now be found a group of three institutions that, in their respective departments of business, stand better. In the upper part of the building are the spacious and handsome quarters of King Solomon's Lodge. The portion of the Hay lands, 116, after being held about thirty years by the Stevens family, was used with the part of 117 on Main St. for Dexter Row, a block of six three-storied brick houses with areas and iron fences, and rather high granite basements in front, built 1836 and later, and occupied, 1, successively by S. Varney, N. A. Tufts, Mr. Damon, Dr. Bickford, and Dr. Blood ; 2, by Hon. Benj. Thompson ; 3, by H. P. Fairbanks ; 4, by Daniel White ; 5, by J. Forster and his son Dr. E. J. Forster until recently; and 6, by Rev. Geo. E. Ellis, D. D., until 1871. David Wood and his son David, Jr., owned a good deal of land north of Green St., most of it unimproved. In 1801 Oliver Holden bought a tract from the N. W. corner of 118 to Green St., and ex tending up the hill. Wood St. was laid out (1801), and he sold (1802) to Jos. Reed the lot between it and the passage way north ward. On the corner of Wood St. is a plain three-storied brick 10"], [210, "146 MAIN ST., GREEN TO UNION ST. house, the upper story low, and, formerly, a shop half in the cellar at the end towards Main St. It was built before 1815, and in it and around it was Lynde's carriage factory, afterwards removed across Main St. Two three-storied brick houses, not as old, stand on the northerly part. More notable was the part of the lot at the corner of Green St. Here, after the war, stood the Indian Chief Tavern that had a variety of mortgages on it as well as landlords in it, until it was moved to the corner of Miller St. and replaced (1818-19) by the brick meeting-house of the Second Congregational Soc, or Harvard Church, now standing (1887), and described at page 56. David Wood seems to have acquired this estate (1763) from Jas. Roberts, who had it (1761) from Hannah (Sartell) Bacorn, who in herited it as a part of a large estate hereabouts belonging to her family. On it, and on Green's lane, was a house occupied (1761) by widow Margaret Goodwin. There was also a barn from which Ameri cans fired on the left of the British line in the latter part of the battle, and which was in consequence destroyed by a party from the 47th and Marines. Losses here in 1775 were probably claimed for by David Wood (130), who valued a dwelling, barn, 2 shops, and \"shayhous,\" at \u00a3666. 13. 4 (see p. 149); \"fensen stuf,\" \u00a330. 13. 4; dwelling, barn, and \" shayhous my son David in,\" \u00a3666. 13. 4 ; (here ?) and \" one pue in the meatinhous,\" \u00a364. 5. 8. Other parts of the Sartell estate were bought by him (1740, 1753), and extended beyond the limits of Plan IV. On the westerly side of Main St. is the lot marked 120 that seems to have belonged to Eleazer Johnson. Claim 263 is in this name. 121 seems to have been held by Mrs. Abigail Bradish, inherited from her father, Eleazer Johnson (1768), and forming (?) a part of the claim (46) of her husband, Jonathan (a house, 3 rooms on a floor, lately thoroughly repaired?). This lot extended 157 ft. on the pres ent Union St. The land forming the end of that, at 122, was sold (1769) by Abigail Carey to W. Harris, who claimed (49) for loss of a large new house, 36 X 21, three stories, and a kitchen 15 X 15, two stories; also for a barn, 26 X 18. On 120 and 121 stand three brick houses, three stories high, with sloping roofs, that were for many years occupied by E. Riddle, Henry Forster, and Dr. H. Lyon. John Austin had 123, and Timothy occupied, or owned the prem ises. The former claimed (50) for a dwelling with four rooms on a floor. Not long after the war Jacob Forster bought this lot, and for many years it was occupied by him or his successors for a large fur niture store, kept in a long, low, three-storied wooden building, 49 ft. on Main St., 106 ft. deep, and still here."], [211, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 147 Dea. John Frothingham bought (1747) of the widow of W. Sweetser, lot 124, claimed (29) for loss in 1775, and sold in 1785. The lot changed hands often after that, being held by J. Lynde, J. Cordis, who sold (1798) J. Sivret, who (1799) to S. Brown. E. Larkin sold it (1802) to Artemas Ward, who (1810) to A.Adams, and he (1815) to E. Wheeler. On this site is an old, low, three storied wooden house, with its end towards the street, and on a former garden a recent wooden building, both now with shops. Martha and Eliza Abrahams may have inherited 125 from their father Wm., after 1763, and have sold after the war. Elizabeth stated a loss of a \" yard house \" and furniture. Martha had a small claim (195) for personal, as had a Ralph (278), and Joanna, a widow (306). Richard Boylston, who levied on Wm., brother of M. and E. (1774), afterwards held it (1784-1807), and it was inherited by his son Wm., who died in 1836. On the S. part stands a two storied brick house, built since his time, and now used for a restaurant. Wm. Barber, who lost a house, appears to have mortgaged 126 to T. Mason (1765), who came in possession (1781), and after whom Dr. A. R. Thompson bought (abt. 1807) and held or occupied it until his death (1866). His garden on a part of 125 was subsequently cov ered by a wooden building one story high, with stores, and his three storied white wooden house \u2014 the end of which was on the street, and the upper story low \u2014 was raised and shops were put under it. He was for half a century one of the most familiar and esteemed persons in the town ; and for nearly forty years the family physician in the home where these lines are written. The estate 127 on the corner of Austin St. seems to have belonged to John Codman, who claimed (391) for a dwelling near Capt. Bar ber's (see 31). A two-storied wooden house with a hipped roof stood here from an early date, and was long occupied by Mrs. Draper. At present there is a large three-storied wooden building with a high roof, and with stores below and dwellings above. By the Survey, 1767, it was 93 feet \" from Codman's House over to Mr John Hay's Land \" (lot 116). Here and beyond (?) for 226 ft. on the street, Leach (1780) has placed a few memoranda that are about as puzzling as helpful. Dr. Isaac Rand appears to have owned the land at the opposite N. E. corner of Austin St., and to have sold (1745, deeds 46, p. 312) lot 129, with a house, to Jas. Hay, who sold (1765) to his son John. He left it (1802) to children of Richard Hay, another son, who sold (1804) the corner lot to B. Gage (for many years an occupant). Loss"], [212, "148 MAIN ST. TO MILLER ST. on a house (or two houses?) here would be estimated in the claim (74) of John Hay. Dr. Rand appears to have continued to hold land through the war, and lost hereabouts a barn occupied by T. Rayner. Back of 129 and 130 was a piece of mowing land mortgaged (1767) by Ann to T. Rayner (deeds 66, p. 554). It was N. E. 64 ft. on Benj. Rand, 46 on Nich. Hopping; N. W. 296 on Eleazer Dowse; S. W. 77 on Jos. Lynde; S. E. 306 on Isaac Rand, with a 10 ft. passage to the \"country road\" (see 110). Nicholas Hopping (53), whose house in 1767 was, by the Survey, 53 feet from the corner of Hay's pasture (116), sold lot 130 in 1784. D. Wood, Jr., bought (1768) lot 131, 50 ft. front, where, as his claim (131) was for fences, etc., there seems to have been no house (but perhaps end of a barn 20 ft. long). Eleazer Dowse mortgaged (1760, dis. 1770) to Dr. I. Rand, dwelling-house, shop, barn, etc., at 132, and claimed (54) \u00a3369. 10s. for loss in 1775, only \u00a317. 10s. of which was for personal estate. He had valued a house in Main St. \u00a3266. 13. 4 ; a barn, workhouse, and smoke-house, \u00a373. 6. 8. His son, Thomas Dowse, LL. D., born in 1771, collected (in Cambridgeport) one of the most superb and ex tensive private libraries of English literature ever in N. E., that he gave to the Mass. Historical Society. Back of several lots just described was part of the large amount of land owned by Joseph Lynde, which included the site of the State Prison. He lost about ten buildings, and some of them may have been here. Beyond 132, and along the street northward, was 133, an extensive tract of land owned by Richard Miller (whose marsh was opposite D. Wood). He died in 1755 (see p. 128), and his heirs gave (1765) a general quitclaim to his son Richard, who seems to have held, and to have sold after the war to Jon. Chapman and others. A large part of lots 129 to 132, and of the Lynde and Miller land, is now occupied by wooden houses, most of them old. On Main St., at 129, are, however, two four-storied brick buildings with stores below and dwellings above, and also on Main St., and each side of Chapman St., a little beyond the end of Plan IV., is a block of three-storied brick houses set a few feet back from the street. They occupy the site of the Chapman distillery, a large, low building, that was for years dingy and unsavory. Three of the most notable places on this large area were (at the end of Plan IV.) the garden of S. Johnson, small but very fine, now covered by a shop ; the grass area in front of Dr. Cheever's house (next S.) with two of the noblest trees on private ground on the peninsula, cut down (1885) to make way also for a shop ;"], [213, "PLAN IV"], [214, ""], [215, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 149 and the printing establishment of S. Etheridge, and of his son. The two houses, altered, still stand, of wood, with three low stories, and ends on the street ; but the building whence issued a large part of the volumes ever printed in town was burned over forty years ago. It stood at some distance back from the street, at 132-3, and was of brick and three stories high. Mr. Etheridge (Sr.) bought the estate, with a house, in 1806, and did a good deal of creditable work here, continued by his son (1810-17), but neither of them had the pecuniary success that their enterprise and skill deserved. (The G. and E., which is very imperfect in regard to the earlier printers in the town, mixes the father and son in a brief notice.) On Main St. the more closely occupied ground ended at 113 and 132 on Plan IV., and northward, except in three neighborhoods, there were only scattered houses. These groups and a few of the notable houses were successively as follows : \u2014 At the right, a little beyond the end of Plan IV., and opposite the Chapman estate just mentioned, is a square house, three stories high, the upper story low, and set a few feet back from the street. It is built of wood, and was arranged for, and much of the time occupied by, two families. Internally it was well and quaintly finished, but now it is much changed. According to Drake (S. A., Hist. Mansions, 1874, p. 19), this was the first house \"erected in Charlestown after its destruction in 1775,\" \u2014 a statement repeated in the Memorial History of Boston (1880). In these accounts it is called the house, or mansion, of Thos. Edes, where Samuel F. B. Morse was born, to become one of the most distinguished natives of the town, renowned for his inventions, and remarkable for the honors he received. There is a report, traced to one of the oldest inhabitants, that this house was built about 1759, partly of oak grown on the hill close by, and that the British used it as a bakehouse during their occupation of the pe ninsula, in evidence of which was a remarkably large hearth found under the floor of a back room by the present owner. Papers be longing to another family and dated before the war are said to have been found at the same time under the floor of the second story. As shown already (p. 11), the house here before 1775 was probably not burned June 17th, but used by the British, and its destruction must have been later. Mr. Wood's own list of losses is given under 118. As he was a baker his services would be early in demand, and he may have speedily built, and have worked in the back part of his house, thus accounting for the hearth. Thos.

Wood, who after his death married (1793) John Stanton. As Mrs. Stanton she bought the estate (1797) of the heirs of Wood, and held it until her death (1818). Farther north on Main St., and on this side (easterly), the houses seem to have been more separated. Opposite the shop of R. Miller (lot 133) was John Stone's estate, 68 ft. front, bought in 1766, in his claim (108), and sold by his wife (1795). Isaac Call (98), who married a daughter of Dea. John Frothingham, lost a shop. Isaac Kidder & Son bought (1774) adjoining Frothingham prop erty and claimed (101) for a dwelling, as did Sam?* (or more likely Jas.) Kenney (103), who had also a shop. He bought in this neigh borhood (1767) and sold in 1787. John Stimpson also owned prop erty originally Frothingham, but long in his family, and claimed (93) for a dwelling in \" fore street.\" Next to him Mercy Frothingham claimed (300) for \u00a7 of a house, a woodhouse, and furniture. On the other (westerly) side, at the corner of Miller St. (?), Ste phen Pierce (106) held (1768 to 1800) a lot 157 ft. front, and 330 to 367 ft. deep. He lost a house, barn, and \"furintur.\" Next him seems to have been John Chamberlain, who bought just before the war, and claimed (62) for a house new-shingled, with four lower rooms, one chamber, fine new sash windows, and a shop at the back. Thomas Wood claimed (66) the unusually large amount of \u00a3412. 10s. for loss on personal estate. He seems to have been a dealer in furniture, and had a large stock, including 43 desks, 23 tables, etc. His place was near the entrance to the old Burying ground. Opposite it he had a pasture, and Benj. Wood a lot of mowing ground, and a small claim (52). Margaret Thomas, spinster, had a hard time hereabouts, buying (1773) on mortgage a house on Main St., claiming (63) for loss of it (1775), and having the mortgage foreclosed (1776) by Gov. Increase Sumner. Sarah Frothingham also hereabouts (?) had a claim (69) for loss of a house, and personal estate. Mill Village and Neighborhood. This was a group of houses at and near the junction of Main, Mill, and Eden Sts. Approaching it from the south, there were several estates on the Westerly side of Main St. Abigail Frothingham (64), wife of Thos.

Frothingham (68), who lived on the lot next north of the engine house opposite Walker St., and who lost a dwelling, barn, and shop. At his house, built of course after the war, Gen. Washington made the only piivate call \u2014 the only call \u2014 that he ever made in Charles town. All the three last-named losses included personal. The Froth inghams held lands in this neighborhood from its settlement, owning nearly across the peninsula, and, until recent years, being here rep resented by several families. Richard's great square wooden house, built after the war at the corner of Eden St., was prominent. Mrs. F. Hall still represents the family on their old ground, in a well known and hospitable house, a brick one with a swell front and three stories. John Fenton, named in the Leach sketch, was some where near here. Wm. Wyer claimed (210) for loss of the Cape Breton Tavern at the corner of Main St. and Mill St., the site of which he sold (1785) to B. and E. Mitchell. From the \"main Road\" a highway 25 feet wide led to the mills, that in some form stood from early to recent times. For losses here Wm. Pain claimed (72) \u00a3800., the value of eight buildings, \u2014 a large double dwelling, a barn 30 X 18, a mill-house with 2 gristmills, a store 60 X 24, a store 30 X 16, a fulling-mill with 3 pairs of stocks, a smoke-house, a wharf, and gates to the mill pond. These buildings, or some of them, were not de stroyed until Jan. 1776, and then by Americans as a necessity of war. Wm. Greene claimed (70) \u00a3120. for a house, cistern, and wharf, near them. On the easterly side of Main St., approaching from the south, Leach has marked successively, with the lengths of frontages on the street, \"Jos. Frothingham\" (60 ft.), who claimed (59) \u00a3358. for loss on buildings; \"J. Frothingham\" (114ft.); \"Colley\"(?)

The next lot is marked by Leach vacant ; the next \" Edes,\" and the last he notes on the street, \" Mallet's house,\" appears to have been Isaac Mallet's, \"blacksmith\" and \"schoolmaster at the neck,\" who had considerable property and a claim (89) \u00a3558. Martha Mallet (90) had a small claim. In this region seems to have been Bethia, widow of Thos. Call, who stated a loss of a dwelling, barn, and outhouse. From the Mill Village"], [218, "152 NECK VILLAGE AND NEIGHBORHOOD. to the end of the neck by the main land the ground along Main St. was low, and much of it marshy, so that it was overflowed by high tides, thus accounting for an absence of houses on it for nearly half a mile. The Survey of 1767 mentions little except marshes, lands, and fences. Neck Village and Neighborhood. There was a group of estates and houses on the main land close to the narrow neck. Of the owners Abigail Williams (81) lost fur niture ; John Hancock (84) a large dwelling, barn, and small build ings (see 73); James Fosdick (part of 86) a dwelling \"just without the Neck,\" and his fences and trees were damaged ; the estate of Jabez Whittemore (87), \"innkeeper,\" who died in 1773, a house, barn, and store ; Wm. Lamson, who lost boats and other personal, and Joseph Lamson, who had a large and comfortable estate, lost a dwelling with 3 stacks of chimneys, a shop, barn, etc. (He also had a wharf, and about a dozen acres of land, most of it cultivated.) Frances Lamson, for John, deceased, stated a loss of a house \" with 5 smoaks,\" a shop, storehouse, and barn. Some of the Temple prop erty (see next page) was close by, and apparently some of its large loss (416). At a short distance was the ferry to Maiden, and on the way to it was John Beacham (80), who lost a large dwelling with 14 rooms, a barn, \" wearhouse,\" goldsmith shop, and sundry small buildings (Relief Ellery reported that the Continental forces took much fur niture and clothing, owned by her, from his (?) house June 17) ; also Capt. Beal (82) \u00a3120. on real estate; Stephen Sweetser (83), \"ferryman,\" who lost a house and barn; and Lydia Abbot (99) near the ferry, who had a house and shop. All these had per sonal losses. Stephen Miller (395) lost chiefly trees, fences, etc. On the road to Medford was John Deland, who stated that he lost a house, barn, and woodhouse. As buildings included in these losses were much too far from the main town to catch fire from it, they were probably destroyed by the British \" armed transport \" stationed to rake the neck. The de struction, probably from the same source, extended inland and along the road to Cambridge, that for some distance was near the water. In the Mass.

A descendant of Sir Purbeck Temple (G. and E., 938) of Co. Bucks, Eng., Robert Temple, held it and claimed (416) for losses in 1775, amounting to \u00a3965. 4s., none of which was on buildings, and \u00a3260. on personal estate. This was the original country seat of Gov. J. Winthrop, whose heirs sold the farm (1677) to the widow of Peter Lidgett, merchant, of Boston. Her daughter married Lt.-Gov. Usher, of N. H., into whose posses sion the farm seems to have passed after his wife's death (1698), for he mortgaged it (1707-10, etc.) described as \"309 acres upland, 146 acres marsh.\" At his death it was estimated 500 acres, worth \u00a310,000. From the Usher heirs it passed (1740) to Robt. Temple, and from him to his son (above), who, 1764-65, mortgaged it as 251J acres. From the Temples it passed (1780) to N. Tracy, mer chant, of Cambridge and Newburyport, and later (1785) it was mortr gaged to Hon. Thomas Russell, when there were about 300 acres, with buildings (deed 91, 408). In May, 1842, by a map (1 B. 48, deeds) the farm extended along the line of Medford from the river to Winter Hill road, and by these to a creek eastward. Subsequently the farm was occupied by Col. S. Jaques, an agriculturalist and sports man, who kept his dogs, dressed somewhat in the quaint fashion of an English country squire, and, in a degree, followed his ways, and lived in a square, two-storied, wooden house, shaded by a few elms and standing conspicuously on one of the hills towards the river. His heirs mortgaged the farm (1852-58) when it was a remnant of 80 acres, 25 rods, all between the river and Medford turnpike. The whole place is now (1887) dismantled, as it has been for years, leav ing it a dreary waste as the ending of the one early estate in the town resembling or suggesting an English gentleman's country seat. In the long list of claims there are a few that the writer has not placed, accurately or probably, as on the foregoing pages. These claims are of Nehemiah Norcross (13), a workshop, etc., \u00a326. \u2014 Estate of Nath. Souther (121), a house with a kitchen, and a barn, \u00a3125. \u2014 Thomas Newell (209), a dwelling and a little furniture, \u00a3200. \u2014 Sam. Harris (232), dwelling and bakehouse, \" which Cost me \u00a3186. 13. 4,\" claim \u00a3200. \u2014 T. Dayley (251), a dwelling, out house, and \" New sinsing,\" also furniture, \u00a387. (a claim seems not to have been allowed for his \" beeing Cast away on account of not knowing"], [221, "155 TOWN LIST OF LOSSES, 1775. Where for to Come to on the 6 day of Novemb. 1774\"). \u2014 Estate of Thomas Dizart (252) (list by widow Mary ?), dwelling with 3 lower rooms, 2 chambers, 2 garretts, 2 stacks chimneys, a large barn, a little house, 50 trees bearing fruit, furniture, etc., \u00a3395. 3. 2, made in the claim \u00a3250. (B. Hill, near the Training field?) \u2014 Jon. Carey (286), dwelling and furniture, \u00a380. \u2014 John Carey (287), dwelling, work-house, timber, and furniture, \u00a3213. (Mardling St.?). \u2014 Sam. Preston (298), of Littleton, J of a house, and \u00a3 of a house, \u00a3116. \u2014 Benj. Mirick (363), dwelling adjoining Jos. Hopkins, \u00a310. (Fish St.?). Besides the claims that include buildings, nearly all of which have been located, there were many for personal property only, furniture, shop-stock, loss of trees, crops, fences, and other damage, most of which it would be hard to place. The object of the writer, after great labor, has been attained, \u2014 that of finding the arrangement and ex tent of the town burned. Among the lists prepared by the individual sufferers there are names and buildings \u2014 especially parts of the latter \u2014 mentioned and not found on the list of the committee. Of these the writer finds un certain the location of Sarah Call's J of a house ; John Harding's \u00a7 of a dwelling, on Main St., with 3 rooms on a floor, 3 square cham bers, and a garret ; Thos. Hender's house and furniture ; Eliz. Miller's dwelling (main st.) ; Sarah Miller's house and barn ; Thos. Powar's house ; some of Dr. Rand's houses ; Mary Rand's half house and barn ; Mary Smith's mansion, outhouse, and large shop ; Aaron Town send's house, \"which cost more than \u00a380.;\" and Henry Sweetser's shop and tools. Claims for some of these may have been finally made under other names. TOWN LIST OF LOSSES, JUNE 17, 1775. A book in MS., lettered Charlestown Archives, Vol. 59, among the records of the Town, bears a written title on its third page : \" This Book contains, | an Estimate of the Loss | sustained, by the Inhabi tants of | Charlestown | by the Destruction there of | June 1 7th Anno Domini, | 1776.\" The first and fourth pages are blank, the second bears \"R. Deven's\" at the upper left corner, and the date shows an error of one year, as is found to be the case elsewhere in the records. At the top of the fifth page is the entry : \" In the Committee ap pointed by the Inhabitants of | Charlestown at their meeting in March 1776 to receive | and liquidate the Accounts of Losses said Inhabitants | have sustained by burning the Buildings in Charlestown | and other"], [222, "156 TOWN LIST OF LOSSES, 1775. Ravages of the British Troops in said town.\" Also : \" Voted, as the sense of this Committee, that in making | the Estimate above referred to, it will be expedient to | consider the losses in the following manner, viz; first, | The loss on Buildings the sum to be allowed for any | Build ing to be so much as will make the Building as good | as it was imme diately before its destruction, Secondly | the Damage done to Land, Trees and fences, Thirdly, the | loss in personal Estate.\" The lower third of this page is blank, and there are neither signa tures, names of the Committee, place of meeting, nor date. On the next page the following list of losses begins. In order to determine the extent and plan of the town in 1775, the writer endeavored to place as nearly as he could, after much labor, each loss, or the home of each claimant, as this course was the only one by which a nearly satisfactory result could be obtained, and for reference the whole list is here printed (for the first time, it is thought). The Town meeting that acted in the matter was held \" at Mr. Jere miah Snow's, innholder, in Charlestown, March 6, 1776,\" without the peninsula, all within having been destroyed. The Committee con sisted of the seven Selectmen : Nath! Gorham, Nath1 Frothingham, Peter Tufts, Jr., Capt. Jno. Stanton, Stephen Miller, David Wood, Jr., and Tim0 Tufts, to whom were added Richard Devens, Benj. Hurd, Thos. Wood, Peleg Steams, John Larkin, and David Cheever. April 3, Capt. Nathan Adams, Ebenr Breed, Capt. Isaac Foster, Nath! Brown, John Frothingham, and John Turner were also added. It was voted that any seven of the nineteen were to be a quorum, and that meetings should be held in Cambridge. The report was made and accepted May 16, 1776. Later meetings were held in \" Mr. Swan's barn,\" and \" at the house of Mrs. Anna Whittemore, innholder.\" Note of the ill-success of this and other efforts has already been made. The numbers 1 to 484, and the last column of references to places, are added to the original list by the writer for convenience."], [223, "TOWN LIST OF LOSSES, 1775. 157 Names os Persons.

A large proportion of the people were, in some form, Protestants. These, while agreed sub stantially in faith, had different opinions upon some points held to be of profound importance. Out of the religious change arose the Church of England, with the sovereign, not the Pope, as its appointed earthly head, and a reformed but yet conservative observance of some forms and words and usages that had been known since Christianity became an organized and wide-spread power. Within the Church, at first, there was, however, a great body, with a large amount of piety and learning, that desired still greater change. This, at length, in King James's reign, could be reduced, it has been stated, \" to these four heads : purity of doctrine, the supply of the churches with good pastors, the Scriptural administration of church government, and the improve ment of the Book of Common Prayer.\" The advocates of greater change \u2014 and greater purity, as they believed \u2014 were known as Puri tans. The Church of England became the ruling power ; and, world wide, ruling powers in Church and State, when James I. was king, re garded a dissenter as a sort of rebel who should be suppressed. The Puritans were made to feel this fact. And thus a vigorous, intelligent, determined party chafed in England under rule from which it naturally sought relief or an escape ; and sundry men within it were considering not only an escape, but reali zation of a grand conception. John Winthrop, a well-educated, wealthy gentleman of rare and noble character, who lived at Groton in the pleasant rural lands of Suffolk ; Thomas Dudley, once a soldier, later a good steward to the Earl of Lincoln ; Increase Nowell, well bred and long tried, among whose nearer ancestors or relatives was Alexander, the prolocutor of Queen Elizabeth's first convocation, so decisive to the Puritans ; John Wilson, son of William, prebend of three of the grand churches of Old England, \u2014 these and many others, scattered through that country, thought and acted. Meanwhile different events prepared a way for them. At a time when, says Dr. Haven, English \" colonization [of America] had been virtually abandoned in despair,\" two men, to whom this country owes much, sought \" a proper seat for a plantation \" in New England. In 1602 the illustrious friend of Shakespeare, the Earl of Southampton, largely paid the cost of an important voyage made by Bartholomew Gosnold directly to the Bay of Massachusetts, to Cape Cod and islands south of it. He brought back such good accounts of what he found that, four years later, for the purpose named, a charter was procured,"], [245, "177 ITS BEGINNING. \"from which,\" continues Dr. Haven, \"the ultimate settlement of the United States, and the resulting heritage of territorial rights, are to be dated.\" It may be sufficient here to state that after various difficulties there was formed \u2014 Nov. 3, 1620 \u2014 The Council at Plymouth in Devon for Planting and Governing New England in America. There were forty patentees, of whom several were peers, the others men of conse quence. From them the Pilgrims by the Mayflower obtained a patent dated June 1, 1621. From them, March, 1628, a grant was had of lands \" extending from the Atlantic to the Western Ocean,\" and be tween a line \" three miles north of the River Merrimac,\" to one \" three miles south of the Charles.\" In one year after that, a Massachusetts Company was chartered, with the power to colonize, govern, and repel by sea or land all persons who attempted the destruction or the detri ment of planters. It, indeed, was a commercial and a planting company, and soon prepared to prosecute its business. \" Meanwhile,\" wrote Dr. Palfrey, \" a movement of the utmost im portance, probably meditated long before, was hastened by external pressure.\" Puritans, who felt the strong repression of their principles in England, had resolved, but after \" sorrowful reluctance,\" \" to emi grate at once to the New World.\" Most of them were from the eastern counties, \u2014 Suffolk, Lincolnshire, and the East Riding. The leaders were well-educated, thoughtful, and far-looking men, with no small fortunes, and exalted purposes. The wise and energetic use of all their means resulted in the chief attempt to colonize New England that had yet been made, and the presence on Town Hill in Charles town, July, 1630, of large numbers of the colonists associated with them. Many, and perhaps the great majority, appear to have been plain, substantial country -people, \u2014 they, like their leaders, thoroughly devoted to Puritanism, and endowed with vigorous English sense. Their purposes could not be fully told in England, where and when these might be hindered or prevented. They came here to settle, plant, and build, to earn an honest living, and make homes as good as could be, for they knew the worth of homes. But wider and far higher than material things was the great purpose of their coming. It was not for wealth alone, or power, or toleration as we know it. \" Their lofty and soul-enthralling aim,\" says Dr. Ellis, \" the condition and reward of all their severe sufferings and arduous efforts, was the establishment and administration here of a religious and civil commonwealth . . . founded\" on \"the Bible, the whole Bible ; \" or as Governor Winthrop wrote, \" whereas the way of 12"], [246, "178 THE FIRST CHURCH. God hath always been to gather his churches out of the world ; now the world, or civil state, must be raised out of the churches.\" Without delay the colonists began, with sturdy English pluck and sense, the ordering of things material by which they were to live, of needed civil institutions, and above all of their churches that were as the soul to the material body. July 8, 1630, they kept a public day of thanksgiving for their ar rival, a day observed through all the plantations ; one that might be called the first great New England Thanksgiving, and observed upon Town Hill by probably the largest number of English that had yet been gathered on New England ground. Friday, July 30, the covenant of a church was signed, upon or near this hill. On August 27 John Wilson was appointed teacher, Increase Nowell ruling elder. The number of members was about one hundred. The first place of meeting is said to have been under the Charlestown Oak ; afterwards the services were in the Great House, so called, built for the governor, and standing near the southwest corner of the present City Square. The settlers failed to find good water that was close by, and disease prevailed. A movement was begun across the river to a neighboring peninsula. By autumn a large number were established there ; and on September 7, old style, the town that they began was known as Boston. In November the governor, the minister, and other chief men moved there. Church service, it is said, was held alternately in the two places. It was two years later when the first meeting-house in Boston was erected. As Hubbard says, \" they made but one con gregation for the present.\" As Governor Hutchinson wrote, \" they considered themselves, ... at first, as but one settlement and one church, with Mr. Wilson for their minister.\" At length a large part of the people were in Boston, services were chiefly held there, storms and ice in winter made the passage of the river difficult, and when the fall of 1632 was closing, it was thought best that a separate church should be established here. Governor Winthrop states that \" those of Charlestown who had formerly been joined to Boston congregation were dismissed \" from it. They numbered nearly one fourth of it. The Records of the First Church, Charlestown, state that the first (35) signers of its covenant \"were dismissed from Boston Church,\" \u2014 one that from the beginning has been very prominent and influential, known as the First Church, Boston, of which Hubbard wrote two hundred years ago, \" some have been heard to sa}', they believed [it] to be the most glorious church in the world.\""], [247, "ITS ORGANIZATION. 179 Friday, Nov. 2, 1632, \u2014 Nov. 12, new style, \u2014 was made a day of fasting and prayer in Charlestown. Sixteen men, all with their wives, and three men singly, signed a church covenant, and formed the organization to-day existing here. The Rev. Thomas James, a graduate of Emanuel College, Cambridge, was elected and ordained the pastor. Ralph Mousall and Thomas Hale became the first two deacons. With serious contemplation of their place and mission, this small band of thirty-five began their work. The territory of the town at first was large and long, extending eight miles up into the country, but soon became diminished by formation of new towns. In ten years Woburn was incorporated ; seven years later, Maiden. A great part of the population for a long time occupied a village near the present Square and Boston ferry, or along \" the Country Road,\" now called Main Street. Moving out of Charlestown, that began so early and extensively, has always since continued; yet the town has constantly increased in population. Of the nineteen families that had been represented on the covenant of 1632, eight were gone within a dozen years, two more in fifty, six more in about a century. The settlement of the first minister lasted less than three years and a half, but after his time settlements were long ; nine made before the Revolution averaged more than twenty-five years each, including two that prematurely closed by early deaths. The first name on the covenant signed here, November, 1632, was Increase Nowell, who, Dr. Budington wrote, \"may be considered the father of the church and the town. He was a zealous Puritan and active and devout Christian, and deserves to be held in grateful esteem by the citizens of this Commonwealth, and especially by the inhabitants of this town.\" He left abundance in Old England for privations here. His immediate family, before and after him, was honorable. His sons, Alexander and Samuel, were graduates of Harvard. The former wrote an almanac for 1665, printed by Samuel Green at Cambridge in that year. The latter was styled the \" excellent \" and \" never-to-be-for gotten,\" the \" Fighting Chaplain in Philip's War.\" Both were among the very earliest writers in this town whose work was printed in Amer ica. Another name is Ralph Mousall, one of the first two deacons. He was a selectman for nearly twenty-five years, and from 1636 to ] 638 a representative to the General Court, that expelled him, after questioning him about what he had said in favor of Mr. Wheelright, who had delivered an obnoxious Fast Sermon. Historians tell us now that the Court was wrong and the Deacon was right. John Hale, the other deacon, was a selectman for eleven years. His son John, bap-"], [248, "180 THE FIRST CHURCH. tized here 4th month, 5th day, 1636, became the first minister at Beverly, and author of \" A Modest Enquiry into the Nature of Witch craft,\" printed in 1702, \u2014 perhaps the rarest book on witchcraft in New England, and worth more now, for its size at least, than perhaps any other New England book of the eighteenth century. Two other signers were William and Ann Frothingham, the only signers whose name and lineage now remain, or for many years have remained, in this town. Their descendants have been numerous ; con stantly some of them have been in positions of trust. Three of them successively were deacons of this church, their terms of office reaching ninety-seven years. And, at a time like this, how we lament the ab sence here of one in whose too early death so many of us lost a friend, and Charlestown one of its most cherished citizens and its historian, \u2014 Richard Frothingham ! Dec. 22, 1634, the Rev. Zechariah Symmes was here installed. Born in Canterbury, that delightful ancient city closely associated with the planting of the Christian faith in England, \u2014 another graduate of Emanuel, \u2014 he labored here for thirty-seven years. Meanwhile, a common school was established, \u2014 eleven years before the law of Mas sachusetts ordered that a town must have one. On the 6th of November, 1637, the Rev. John Harvard, still another from Emanuel, became a member of this church. He, for some por tion of his brief time here, supplied the pulpit, and died on Sept. 14, 1638. We all know how and where his name has been enshrined, and how in those days of small things great things arose, and Puri tans by the Bay of Massachusetts testified to their belief in true, sound learning. John Harvard of Charlestown gave about twice as much as the whole colony had dared to promise for the college that was begun at Cambridge. In 1639 the Rev. Thomas Allen, like many of his people an Eastern County man, was installed, or was ordained, as teacher and assistant. He remained here for twelve years. Meanwhile the purposes of those who founded Massachusetts were developed, and affairs with which they or their children had to deal. The Synod of 1637 was assembled to consider doctrines held by Mrs. Anne Hutchinson; a second in 1648 to form an ecclesiastical consti tution; and another in 1662, of great importance, respecting baptism and a consociation of churches. In 1 648 a case of witchcraft is said to have originated in this town, and to have been the first in Massa chusetts. A few years later occurred the dealings with the Quakers, so often mentioned. The leading member of this 6ect in Charlestown was severely fined."], [249, "181 EARLY CHARACTERISTICS. Grave charges of intolerance, of persecution, and of superstition have been made against the Puritans in Massachusetts. The plain statement of their rights, of their position, and their purpose here, is quite sufficient answer to much said against them. They were here at first as members of a private corporation, through which they had honestly obtained their lands for homes where they proposed to carry out their plan of a religious state, as they could not in England. They had invested, labored, suffered for their purpose. Through all their earlier period of weakness they must do no less than keep out those who would impair, imperil, or even ruin their great plan. It may be questioned whether any church, society, or club, or school, in its own building, now could safely do much less. Whatever may be thought about their plan, it was one well worth trying ; and Americans owe quite enough to them to be at least both just and civil to them. All of the Quakers, two centuries ago, were not the counterparts of estimable Quakers of late generations and to-day. It is a question whether sundry of their ways would be allowed in public now. \" The Puritans,\" Judge Parker wrote, \" had no peace, but ' torment upon torment ' from the Quakers.\" And, indeed, \" so far from the Puri tans persecuting the Quakers, it was the Quakers who persecuted the Puritans.\" What is now called the witchcraft delusion was once a belief, \u2014 one of the few beliefs in which, it has been said, the various divisions among Christians once remarkably agreed. A person who uses names, dates, and facts found in New England in the last half of the seven teenth century, and does not heed others, may make it seem that our forefathers were a superstitious and bloodthirsty race. They did act harshly in some cases ; we wish now we could say in none. But things in this world are comparative as well as positive. Men should be judged by their own age, and not by our age. When the wide, long prevalence of a belief in witchcraft and its punishment are thought of, we realize that a curious characteristic that marked their times, to but a moderate extent marked them. It is sad that even one trial of a man by torture ever has occurred in Massachusetts ; but when we examine what the seventeenth century was through Christendom, \u2014 the appalling use of torture in ecclesi astical and civil cases, the abominable dungeons, \u2014 we can feel deep thankfulness that our forefathers were so much less cruel than their ace. And furthermore, there seems to be good reason for believing that instead of being chief among the sinners, they were first among those who reformed, and who renounced what we now hold to be an"], [250, "182 THE FIRST CHURCH. error. They had their faults, of course, and we may now be even glad that we did not live with them ; but when Americans must make apologies because they hurt the feelings of George III., it may be time to make apologies for our old Puritans, and not until that time. Their virtues and heroic faith have been already here to-day re vealed afresh with eloquence and truth, in a discourse [by the Rev. Alex ander McKenzie, D.D.] to which no other words than those of thanks and appreciation can be added. In 1658 died good John Green, the only ruling elder of the church, admitted to it less than five months after it was organized. He kept its early records and those of the town. His admirable writing is a model, testifying to his careful thoroughness. In 1669 another celebrated Boston church was organized in Charles town, \u2014 the Old South. Its first minister, the Rev. Thomas Thatcher, was a member of this church. At this period two pastors of our church are especially distinguished : Thomas Shepard, who was ordained in 1659, and who died in 1677; and his son Thomas, who after some uncertainty in the matter was, three years later, made his successor. The former, in 1672, preached the Election Sermon at Boston, \u2014 probably the first sermon by a Charlestown minister printed in America. An elegy upon his death, composed by the Rev. Urian Oakes, was one of the earliest poems com posed and printed in this country. He is said to have been \" a very holy man, much distinguished for his erudition, his various virtues, and winning manners,\" and also \" a watchful guardian of Harvard College.\" Indeed, he was a son worthy of his honored father, the Rev. Thomas Shepard of Cambridge Church. Thomas, the third thus named in this remarkable family, and the only minister of this church who was bap tized in it, was also distinguished for learning, for piety, and the un usual success of his labors. His salary, it is of interest to note, was \u00a3100 a year. Unhappily, in 1685, he died, aged only twenty-seven, lamented by all. His funeral was attended by the governor and mag istrates, by many of the clergy, and the faculty and students of the college. Cotton Mather says he was \" A Son that was the Lively Pic ture of his [father's] Virtues,\" a \" Confirmation to that Observation, That as the Snow-Ball, the further it rolls, the greater it grows, thus the further that the Grace of God is continued, and received, and valued in any Family, the Greater Effects of that Grace will be still appearing.\" For a year and five months the church was then without a pastor. Various ministers supplied the pulpit ; among them, the Rev. Cotton"], [251, "SHEPARD AND MORTON. 183 Mather preached to the Artillery Company. In July, 1686, the Rev. Charles Morton came from England. His family had been of hon orable character for full three hundred years. He was a graduate of Oxford, and a scholar widely known. \"The Worthily Famous,\" wrote John Dunton, with \" Sense Enough for a Privy Counsellour, and Soul Great Enough for a King ; \" \"a person too considerable in his Generation, to want any of our commendation,\" said prominent ministers near here. Received with enthusiasm, he was, after about four months, installed pastor of this church, in the ministry of which he continued eleven and a half years until his death. The disturbances arising from the conduct of Governor Andros, and the Revolution of 1688, also made Mr. Morton prominent. For expressions deemed seditious in his sermon, Lecture Day, Sept. 2, 1687, he was prosecuted and acquitted. By some ninety years he was a precursor of the patriots of another \" glorious Revolution.\" To the close of his pastorate, and nearly also of the seventeenth century, the number of admissions to the church was 649, and of bap tisms 1675. It is thought that the earliest baptism of an adult was in 1673. The only marriages recorded by the ministers before the Revo lution were from 1687 to 1697, by Mr. Morton. From this time to the end of the Colonial Period the history of the church must be briefly sketched. The Rev. Simon Bradstreet, or dained in 1698, was minister for forty-three years, during eight of which he was assisted by the Rev. Joseph Stevens, who was ordained in 1713, and whose death at the age of thirty-nine was caused by his heroic labors among the sick. In 1724 the Rev. Hull Abbot was ordained, beginning a pastorate of fifty years. Associated with him nearly thirty-five years was the Rev. Thomas Prentice, installed in 1739. He died, aged eighty, in 1782, after a pastorate of forty-three years. All these four were natives of New England, and were gradu ates of Harvard College, \u2014 good and true men, faithful and successful in their work. The number of admissions from 1698 to 1775 was about 954; of baptisms, 4,381. The Record from 1632 gives over 7,600 names, that must have belonged to nearly 7,000 persons. Among the mem bers of the church esteemed here, and too many to be mentioned now, we should, at least, recall some names. General Robert Sedgwick, admitted at the end of 1636, was, in 1652, made the highest military officer in the colony. In the last two years of his life he served Oliver Cromwell. Thomas Graves, from the same ruler, received the title of"], [252, "184 THE FIRST CHURCH. Admiral.1 Francis Willoughby, an enterprising citizen, was \" almost constantly \" in public office. All these three were merchants. Five generations of the Russell family in turn supplied the church and town with men who were among the most distinguished in them both. In 1640 Richard came from Hereford. James, his oldest son, was born herein that year. His son Daniel lived till 1763. The fourth was James, the son of Daniel, born here in 1715. The last was Thomas, second son of James, born 1740. All bore well the title Honorable ; all were business men or merchants ; all were benefactors of this church. The clock upon the gallery bears the name of Thomas Rus sell, who gave it. One sacramental tankard bears initials, probably of Richard, who died in 1676. In 1686 Judge Samuel Penhallow, the author of the \"History of the Wars of New England with the Eastern Indians,\" joined the church, and was a member nearly thirty years. In 1703 died Cap tain Richard Sprague, descended from the early settlers of that name. He gave money for the ministers, the school, the poor, and for sacra mental plate (two tankards of which now remain), and, chiefly, the old parsonage, with house and land. In 1705 the Rev. Timothy Cutler, afterwards President of Yale College, and for more than forty years the rector of Christ Church in Boston, became a member. The Rev. Joseph Lord was brought up here. He, Feb. 2, 1696, is said to have officiated at the first communion in Carolina, near Charleston. The Rev. Stephen Badger, missionary to the Natick Indians, also was a member. The great subjects of the times appear to have been treated in this pulpit, as at earlier dates. Thomas Prentice preached on the Reduc tion of Cape Breton, and Hull Abbot on the Scotch Rebellion, both in 1745. Here the Rev. George Whitefield preached to crowded congrega tions, and the great revival of 1741 ensued, when there were sixty-six admissions to the church, \u2014 the largest number in any year. The chair and Bible that he used are still preserved. The place of worship of the church, although close to this spot from the beginning, was not permanent till 1639. Then a meeting-house 1 This church and society not only had distinguished representatives in the great Civil War or the public service in England over two centuries ago, but also in the great Civil War in the United States. Among those who have been members of this church or congregation were Admiral Foote, Admiral Green, Admiral String ham, and Admiral Taylor. Commodore John B. Montgomery was many years a member of this church, and the family of Captain Hudson of the Exploring Expe dition was also represented."], [253, "HISTORY TO 1775. 185 was built upon the hill-slope toward the Square. With various changes it existed seventy-seven years, and was then replaced by a framed build ing with a steeple, that was burned upon the 17th of June, 1775. So far as now appears, it was a wooden structure, in the general style of the old meeting-houses in this region. In the claims for losses it was valued at \u00a33,000. (See pp. 115, 174.) The material things remaining from the times before the Revolu tion, and associated with the church, are small and few, but their value is thus made the greater. The original Church Record from 1632, kept by Elder Green, and after him by the successive ministers to 1768, is carefully preserved. Its contents have been printed, three quarters in the Historic-Genea logical Register, and all in a large quarto volume, copies of which have been placed in various libraries. Every name and statement in the Records will be found there. Several pieces of communion-service also 6till remain. The tomb in which the ministers were buried stands in the old graveyard of the town, and has been marked anew. (See p. 78.) Some of their discourses have been printed, but copies have been seldom seen here in this century. Some manuscripts of sermons are preserved. Nineteen, preached by the Rev. Thomas Shepard (2d), in 1668 and 1669, are owned by the American Antiquarian Society. The spring of 1775 brought its peculiar trials to the town and church. A great alarm was caused in April, when the royal troops returned from Lexington, and many of the people left their homes. The father of good Deacon Miller was then killed. Removals, both of families and property, continued, so that by the middle of the month of June about two hundred persons only were left in the town east of the neck. Upon the 17th of June a large part of the members of the church and congregation lost their houses and much other property in the great conflagration.1 The patriotic Deacon Miller, with his gun, went up to Bunker Hill and did good service. The Records of the church state that more than three hundred and eighty buildings were destroyed, and that two thousand persons were \"reduced from affluence and medioc rity to the most aggrivated exile.\" The endurance of the people was severely tried, but, in the words of a rare poem of the time, \u2014 \" Not Charlestown's flame that spiring high arose ; Nor all the smoke that aided to oppose ; Could shake the firmness of Columbia's Band, To yield submissive the adjacent land.\" 1 This is very fully described on pages 8-14 and 114-174."], [254, "186 DESTRUCTION AND REBUILDING. After the town was burned, and after hostile troops had left it, some of those who had been living here returned. The place was dreary. Grass, indeed, was growing green on Bunker's and Breed's Hills ; but all around the Town Hill and the Square, and streets near by, were ruins of their homes. The dwellings of the dead upon the Burial Hill alone seemed to have been spared. When first the town was built the forests grew around in wildness, yet in peace and beauty ; but when the rebuilding was begun, the re cent havoc of a cruel war, and dismal evidence of trying loss, everywhere confronted the builders. A memorial informs us that in 1777 \"the returning inhabitants in their distressed situations \" at once provided a place of worship. They \" found no other or better than an old block house left by the British troops upon Town Hill.\" This building was used for the town and school-house, and the meeting-house, for half a dozen years. The Record states that \" the first administration of the Lord's Supper in Charlestown, since the destruction by the cruelest British Enemy, was Nov. 8, 1778, with great solemnity, and fulness of members beyond expectation.\" The venerable Thomas Prentice con ducted the services. The scene was one, indeed, of the most solemn and most touching ever witnessed in this old historic town. In this block-house, Sept. 4, 1780, the townspeople first voted for magistrates under the new State Constitution. There were forty-eight votes. On Oct. 27, 1782, the town voted to convey to the First Parish in it the Town-House Hill, for the purpose of erecting thereon a meeting-house, within five years. In the next year, 1783, the meeting-house required was built upon the present site. It was 72 feet long and 52 feet wide, a wooden structure, with a steeple 162 feet high, designed by Charles Bulfinch. The front lot on the Square, the former site, appears to have become private property at about this time. The bell was presented by Cham pion, Dickason, and Burgis, merchants of London. It has since been broken and recast, \u2014 once by Paul Revere, \u2014 was claimed by the town for town uses, delivered to it by the parish, and finally became private property by purchase. It now hangs in the tower, where the parish has the use of it while the parish does not change, its past religious faith. No minister was settled here until the 10th of January, 1787. The Rev. Joshua Paine, Jr., who had been unanimously called, was minister about a year, when he died at the age of twenty-five. His piety and social virtues were esteemed. \" His remains,\" a record states, \" were decently and respectfully entombed at the expense of the parish, March"], [255, "THE TOWN IN 1775. 187 1st, 1788.\" He was the last minister who died in office in this church, and was buried by it. In November, 1788, the Rev. Jedidiah Morse was unanimously called to the pastorate, and on April 30, 1789, he was installed. His min istry of thirty years extended through a period marked by the change of thought and modes, both in religious and political affairs, that took place under our new institutions. He not only was the pastor of this church, but was also prominent in various public matters, and in the early literature of the nation. Five years before he came he published at New Haven his \" Geography made Easy,\" said to be the first ge ography published in this country. In 1789 his larger work, \"The American Geography,\" appeared at Elizabethtown. Each of these works passed several editions, and began a series of like publications, that his sons continued. Altogether several hundred thousand copies were issued by this family in sixty years. The various other works by Dr. Morse were numerous. His Gazetteer is an important, and per haps unrivalled, \" picture of what this country was \" immediately after the Revolution. The maps and the Reports on Indians that he pub lished, cannot be dispensed with in the illustrations of the early na tional history and art. Some of his works received the honor of reprint in British cities, some of translation, and some were thought worth stealing. In 1802 Dr. Morse, assisted by members of this parish, issued nine teen religious tracts, \"of which 32,600 copies were circulated.\" His son states that \"there can be little doubt that, in 1802, the pastor and people of the First Parish in Charlestown had done more in circulating religious tracts among the poor and destitute in the United States than any other people in New England.\" To one man alone belongs a greater honor. He was, in his time, a chief supporter of this church, and of him it is stated : \" Richard Devens, Esq., of Charlestown, had no equal in America in this benevolence. For him [were] printed more than 100,000 tracts for gratuitous distri bution.\" He died in 1807, aged eighty-six, full of years and honors. On the day Dr. Morse was installed there were 135 church-members, \u2014 43 men and 92 women, \u2014 of whom 40 were widows. On June 1, 1800, the total number was 143. Until this year the First Church had been substantially the one church of the town. In 1800 the First Baptist Church was organized, and May 12, 1801, its meeting-house was opened. Dr. Morse made an address, and Oliver Holden wrote the music for an anthem. In 1800 the town had 2,751 inhabitants and 349 houses. Both of these numbers gradually increased."], [256, "188 THE FIRST CHURCH. In 1803 the growth of the population of the town made necessary an enlargement of the meeting-house, and 15 feet were added on each side. There were then 162 pews, of which 92 were held by the pa rishioners. In 1806, June 10, the number of church-members had increased to 235, of whom 171 were women. There were 40 widows, as in 1789. Within a few years the navy-yard and prison were es tablished, and the general business of the town increased. In 1810 the Universalist Society built its meeting-house, and gathered there some both of the older and the later inhabitants, and some who were not parishioners or members of this church. In 1815 Dr. Morse, with his son Sidney E., and N. Willis, established the \" Boston Recorder,\" said to be the first religious newspaper ever published in this country.1 The effects of the last war with England were severe in this vicinity. In 1815 the town, that then contained about five thousand people, was recovering from them. There were here a dozen or more professional men, seven or eight school-teachers, and an artist, James Frothingham. The community was active and intelligent. Differing beliefs in politics and in religion had grown with the institutions of the young republic, and these last were showing their effect upon the various divisions of the people. The benevolent operations, and what might be called the Charlestown literature of the period, show that good work was done by every class. There was strong feeling then on several subjects, that affected even families, and there was change by death and by removal. Some old names came to be borne by but few persons, or to be upon opposing sides. A notable division had for years been growing up among the Congregationalists in this region, and, 1815-17, it extended to this town, and here resulted in the formation of the Second Congre gational Society, that, in 1837,' was called the Harvard Church. A majority \u2014 a very large one in the church \u2014 remained in the First Church and Parish. The latter lost a valuable minority. Among those who remained members of the First Church at this period were Jeremiah Evarts, \u2014 one of the most distinguished philanthropists at that time in the country, and father of Hon. Wm. M. Evarts, \u2014 and 1 So says the Rev. John Todd, D.D., a member of the First Church (in Sprague'3 LifeofDr. M.,p. 313). \" The Christian History,\" published weekly \" for T. Prince, junr.,\" \u2014 No. 1., Saturday, March 5, 1743, and some time continued, \u2014 is claimed as the first religious newspaper in the world, which naturally includes this country (see Arch. Arner., Am. Antiq. Soc, V. 107). Competing for the distinction is \"The Herald of Gospel Liberty,\" published at Portsmouth, N. H., every other Thursday evening, by Elias Smith, \u2014No. 1, Sept. 1, 1808. No. 44 (Friday, April 27, 1810), was issued at Portland, Me. Smith's name is dropped after Vol. I., and Vol. III. No. 75 is dated Friday, July 5, 1811, at Philadelphia, Penn."], [257, "189 HISTORY, 1819-1870. Samuel Finley Breese Morse, artist and inventor, the only native of the town, it is thought, who received national honors at his death ; his foreign decorations also were remarkable. In 1819 Dr. Morse resigned the pastorate, and was succeeded by the Rev. Warren Fay, who was installed on Feb. 23, 1820. In that year the Methodist Religious Society in Charlestown was incorporated. Another large division of the Congregationalists came in 1832, when, December 27, thirty-four ' persons \u2014 about double the number of church-members who originally joined the Second Church \u2014 were dis missed from the First Church, and formed the Third, or Winthrop Church. The First Church has supplied members to perhaps every other religious organization in the town, and to several churches in other places ; but this appears to be the largest body that has gone from it to any one of them. At the end of 1835, however, the number of its communicants was 271, of whom 79 were admitted by Dr. Morse. On April 22, 1840, the Rev. Wm. Ives Budington was ordained pastor, eight months after Dr. Fay had left. This year, 1840, was the annus mirabilis of the ministry in Charlestown, for then came here three ministers, each to be pre-eminent in his denomination, \u2014 Dr. Ellis, Dr. Chapin, Dr. Budington. Dr. Budington, as he told the speaker near the close of his life, came here with all his young enthu siasm to devote himself to this old church. Within three years he, in nine lectures, told its history, that was printed, and that is among the earlier productions in its class. His work bears testing, and has liter ary character that was soon acknowledged. A few years later, after he returned from his first tour in Europe, he conceived the project of remodelling the meeting-house. The wooden edifice of 1783 became decayed, and was replaced by a brick building, dedicated 1834, \u2014 the one in which we meet.2 The style was then thought classic. The interior was square and plain. The ceiling, low and nearly flat, was whitewashed, and the walls were yellow. Mr. Alexander R. Esty supplied designs, and the existing form and aspect were given to this building. The interior was the first in town to show some of the more established lines of Christian art, ecclesiastical in character. The plain hall of the meeting-house, known for two centuries, became the nave known for a thousand years. In 1868 Miss Charlotte Harris, then of Boston, gave sixteen bells, now in the tower of this meeting-house, and called the Harris Chime. She wrote : \" My ancestors, Harris and Devens, were for a great number 1 January 7, 1833. one more was added. 8 The meeting-houses are more fully described on pages 50 to 59."], [258, "190 THE FIRST CHURCH. of years inhabitants of Charlestown, and worshipped in the church of the First Parish.\" On this account, as also from interest in this soci ety and its pastor, Rev. J. B. Miles, she gave the chime, then one of the largest in the country. In 1870 the present coloring of the inte rior was applied, with some of its significance in early art, and its expression of religious teaching. Over all the congregation, in the nave, \u2014 the Latin navis, that great ship of the church in which we all are carried throu-jh the storms of life to the celestial haven, \u2014 was spread deep blue, the emblem of the peace of heaven. Upon the wall, before the people, is the gray, expressive of humility. And from the language in which the apostles wrote are taken letters joined as they once were upon the tombs of the first martyrs, and here written in bright gold, the emblem of celestial glory, to tell the name, above all other names, before which every knee shall bow, \u2014 the Christos, Alpha and Omega of the church's faith. The pastorate of Dr. Budington closed July 24, 1854, and Rev. James B. Miles succeeded him on Jan. 2, 1855. In 1856 the number of church-members living was 297. The faithful services of Mr. Miles were closed Sept. 30, 1871, when he went to a work, wide as the world, that placed his name in honorable prominence among those who have labored for the spread of peace and of good-will. His sudden death occurred Nov. 13, 1875. Dr. Budington died Nov. 29, 1879, at Brooklyn, where he had been pastor of the large church on Clinton Avenue for more than twenty years. Charitable towards all, learned, eloquent, chivalrous, and courteous, devoted to the highest require ments of his sacred office, he lived and died a true Christian gentleman and teacher. Thus, within a few years, both these long-endeared and valued pastors of this ancient church have, in their turn, been numbered with the many faithful and lamented ministers whom they so worthily succeeded. And at these latest deaths of pastors and of friends we look back on the past, and view the present of the four-hilled town. For we who live here now may well think of the deep significance that changing times at length have given to the four hills that stand on the diminished territory we still call by its old name. On this hill many of the Fathers of New England did their portion of the labor in the founding of our institutions ; on a second stands a monument that testifies their strong devotion to sound learning ; on a third there is a lofty spire bearing the name of the great bishop of Geneva, famed for \" all-embracing charity ; \" upon the fourth is that grand obelisk which tells the meaning of the Revolution. We are all here to live, \u2014 each with individual belief and sense of"], [259, "191 TOWN HILL, CHARLESTOWN. duty, all in peace and quietness. And here we daily see the four hills of the town with their impressive lessons, \u2014 of the open Bible, of sound learning, Christian charity, and civil freedom. May they never teach less to the people here, and always may there be around them benedictions on the \" Church of God in Charlestown.\" Church history, important as it is, is not all that is associated with the Town Hill, Charlestown. The writer gave a brief but comprehen sive sketch of more than the preceding subject might require, in a long article entitled \"An American Shrine,\" that first appeared in the New England Historic-Genealogical Register (Vol. XXIV., July, 1870), a part of which may properly be added here. As early as 1029, when the shore of the \"Bay of Massachusetts\" was an almost unbroken wilderness, the strongest settlement yet made upon it was around this hill ; and on its summit was built, under di rection of Mr. Graves, a defensive work called the \" Hill Fort, with pallisadoes and flankers,\" \u2014 during more than forty years the chief structure there, and necessary for the protection of the settlers. Again, in 1675-76, during Philip's War, the most trying in which Colonial Massachusetts engaged, and when hostilities were committed by Indi ans within a few miles distance, this fort appears to have been again put in defensive order. On the hill, for several years, was the first burial-place of the town, where many of the earliest settlers were in terred, until about 1640, when the still existing Old Burial Ground, about an eighth of a mile distant, was used. (See p. 74.) In 1635 Robert Hawkins built a mill upon the hill, and hence it was for a long time called Windmill Hill. In 1648 the earliest (?) schoolhouse of the town \" was ordered to be built [here] and paid for by a ' general rate.' \" Since that date a public school has been maintained almost uninterruptedly near the summit, to provide education for the practice of civil government, the local seat of which has been, from the very beginning of civilization on the Bay, almost continuously at the base. The time when school or court or town-house were removed was when the town became the first great material sacrifice for American Inde pendence. And as the town grew first around this hill, so also it arose there from its ruin to new life. Beneath the Charlestown Oak, that grew upon the easterly slope, was held the first worship of the church, and all the places for that worship since have been upon the summit, or seventy yards from it, upon one of the sides, or, when in the Great House, only about one hundred yards from it."], [260, "192 AN AMERICAN SHRINE. No other hill throughout New England, except the hallowed Burial Hill at Plymouth, has a longer or more suggestive history, and none has one more varied. These two hills have also a peculiar historic resemblance. Each bore the first permanent and important civilized settlement on its respective bay. On both was a fortification, neces sary for defence against Indians, during many years after the begin ning of colonization upon and around them. On both were buried some of the earliest settlers in the region. At the base of both the Puritan faith was long maintained in churches founded by members of its earliest arrived representatives. . . . Certainly, if in America there are few spots that have become in vested with long, continuous, varied, and interesting historical associ ations, we may be permitted to feel that this hill is one of the spots thus ennobled. In \" the forest primeval \" of oaks that grew on it, the first Christian settlers made homes. On its summit they built a defence against savage tribes close around them. On its slopes they assembled in prayer and thanksgiving and fasting, and there they showed that strength of material resources should be joined with devotion of soul, and in the New World establish a nation for Christ, And in its stern drift, when their griefs and their labors were ended, were laid their mortal remains to await the upbuilding on earth of the city not made with human hands. True, indeed, \" were they in their time, and . . . God them defended.\" And those who in later time enter upon the precious inheritance their endeavors secured, and who can see and enjoy the blessings it brings, may well guard and honor this ground that bears consecration by them and by virtues of many generations ; for its history is not alone of one local body, of one small town, or of one great sect, but a history rendering this low mound of earth a me morial spot of a mighty nation. With reverence we visit the old English Canterbury or Scottish Iona, the Roman Janiculum or Capitoline Mount, sites where the Christianity of nations was \u2014 by a chosen few \u2014 founded in sorrow, and yet in hope, to grow and spread through great communities that gathered around them. And this historical and time-honored Town Hill is truly a Canter bury, an Iona, not alone of the \" Church of God in Charlestown,\" but of the broader church of the great American Republic ; and both of church and of civil institutions, and of varied history and of noble virtues and labors, we well may esteem it and name it An American Shrine."], [261, ""], [262, ""], [263, "RECORDS OF THE FIRST CHURCH. 193 RECORDS OF THE FIRST CHURCH. These, kept by the ministers who were not only the best educated men in the town, but who were also thoroughly acquainted with every body, supply a great amount of reliable matter about the townspeople, and are of special value. As only portions had been printed, the writer thought that the whole of the earlier record should be repro duced in type, and, as already stated, a large amount appeared in the New England Historic-Genealogical Register (1869-79). This, with a good deal more, including all extant from 1632 to 1789, he issued in a quarto volume, copies of which he has placed in libraries. On the following pages, Admissions to the Church, Baptisms, Marriages, and Deaths, from 1789 to 1832, are printed for the first time. The book containing them had a narrow escape before it came into his hands, and the value of its contents, saved here in type from possible future loss, becomes more evident when it is remembered that this is for much of the time named the only extant church record of the town, and also since it is said that the corresponding records of the town for much of the time are either imperfect or are only compilations (with mistakes). Dr. Morse, who kept until 1820 what is here given, was, furthermore, both the most prominent author and the most competent man in the place. Nothing more, however, than mention needs to be made in re gard to the relative and actual importance of records of original entry. With his own hand the writer has copied two full centuries of the ministers' records, and having seen them printed and put in accessible form, he feels that he has done his share. It is proper to add that he has read the proofs of the whole from the original manuscripts. 83= [p. 300 of the Record.] [300] Names of Persons admitted to full | Communion in the Church in Charlestown since the 1\" day of May, 1789. \u2014 1789.

The author died when his proof-reading had extended only a few pages, and an arduous labor was committed by him to his editor, who xvas thus obliged to follow, to great extent, the MS. as he left it. Modest as he was laborious, the author would hardly have claimed that he had found and done every thing, yet he did a vast deal. He had a strong attachment to his native town, and no expression of it could be more touching than his when the writer congratulated him that his life-work had reached the printer. He raised both hands and threw back his head with a silent look of heart-felt delight, and that look was on his face when the writer for the last moment saw him. The manuscript Records of the Town were in much need of care, arrangement, and binding; indeed some of them were only bound in boxes or barrels. Accord ingly one of the last acts of the City Council (1873) was to appropriate funds for this purpose. Fortunately there was a native xvho has a strong regard for the old place, and an intelligent conception of good work. To him was assigned the labor now approaching completion. The necessary expenditures will probably leave him with the frequent reward gained in services for history, \u2014 a clear conscience and invisible pecuniary profits ; but the Records of the old town xvill be in thorough order, associated, as they should be, with the name of Henry H.

It was not an aca demic seat, like Cambridge, or a capital like Boston, neither was it a small, obscure place ; but it was a large, active, fairly representative town, and the printed work of its inhabitants, from first to last, is very well worth an index. None of these books or pamphlets were written or issued without a purpose, or a conviction that they were needed or desirable. Ideas, beliefs, or plans at the time are shown, \u2014 it may be only those con sidered important enough, or that were somehow lucky or unlucky enough to be printed, \u2014 yet they are, after all, some of the best evi dence we have of the thought and feeling of eight generations. No more preface is needed, and the writer continues his work pub lished in 1880, with the thought that while he then named everything 1 Those of single reports or addresses, and works of residents after leaving the town are Generally omitted. Books and pamphlets only, are mentioned, and arti cles in periodicals or newspapers are not, except in regard to Bunker Hill, and in a few cases for special reason."], [334, "262 A BIBLIOGRAPHY he could find after laborious search, and while he has added much, no Bibliography is complete. It is one of the things in which we do and offer the best we can, without claim to omniscience. Every one of our old towns needs such an index, and each of the local libraries, now happily growing numerous, should have the local works it would mention. The writer's experience for years past is that persistent search \u2014 that only \u2014 with the chief reliance on pur chase, can form it, but the time for doing so is fast passing away. In preparing this Bibliography, he has the pleasure of acknowledg ing kind help from the late Admiral G. H. Preble, the Hon. Sam! A. Green, Judge J. W. Austin, Mr. A. E. Cutter, Mr. E. M. Barton, and Mr. E. F. Everett ; also, while printing the book, other aid from Miss Helen Hurd, Dr. E. J. Forster, and Mr. H. H. Edes ; and in enlarg ing the work, aid from Miss Mary F. Andrews, Mr. T. G. Frothingham (and his father's collection), Mr. C. H. Guild, and Mr. E. N. Coburn ; also from authors for notes of their works, furnished by Dr. C. S. Cartee, Mr. A. E.

A correct statement about this little book should he made, as it was re printed (without the knowledge of J. F. H. ) by E. Arber, Birmingham, Eng., in his \"Works of Capt. John Smith,\" 1884; present ownership only being there credited (p. xviii) to J. F. H., and the editorship, etc. (p. ci), to H. Stevens, London. The book is entirely the private property of the writer. He bought the MS., and Mr. S. offered to look after it if he would have it printed at the Chiswick Press, as he could not remain in London. On his return home he wrote the Introduction and sent it to Mr. S., and it and the MS. were printed as proposed, Mr. S. altering, but in no material fact, the first few pages of the Introduction, about the former history of the MS. The writer paid all bills, received all copies, never sold one, and gave copies chiefly to libraries ; and his experience shows the encouragement one may have to buy and print early MSS. in London. \u2014 The Lands of Scott.
