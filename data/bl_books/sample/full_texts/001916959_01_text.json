Some of our best English comedies will, I think, abundantly prove my supposition. In these trifling productions, no attempt has been made to introduce remarkable or ridiculous personages, yet there are some which may be called original ; to form variety in their company dramatic writers often find them selves obliged to have recourse to delineate pecu liarities of dress, of profession, of dialect, &c. ; these in some degree are subterfuges, very well ad mitted as subservient to principals, but sometimes"], [19, "INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE.

She adds, unwilling still to doubt your Majesty, she is yet fearful you are not sincere in your professions of acquiescence to her proposi tions. Czar. Away, away ! can she suspect a man in prison, unarmed, and unattended by a friend ? Pan. Your Majesty has many friends in Russia. Czar. Did I not set off from Oranembaum with out a guard ? Have I not every fortress dismantled, in proof I would not carry arms against my wife ? Now, Panin, friend, or foe, what better testimony could I give, that my first wish is only for retire ment ? Pan.

Czar. That Heaven may have appointed, that this woman shall be supreme in Russia, I do not doubt ; and that she is more fitted than myself to tread the thorny path of government, I question not : but when two roads are open to the goal, if from pure wantonness of spirit, she must pursue the evil way, think you that Heaven will fail to judge her for the choice ? Pan. It is to be inferred, Sire. Czar. Come, let us hear this thing, I do com mand you ! read it fully, without abridgement, or any modest softening of what looks blackest in your eye. Pan.

I think \u2014 indeed if that were my case, whether it is from living so long in your honor's service, for they say, like master like man, I think I should be inclined to look at the bottom of the ocean first.

Oviedo. Not two miles distant ! distraction ! Call. What now ? Oviedo. Can he have received my letter of re jection which I sent not many hours ago 1 Call. Of course, that is one reason of his tra velling so fast ; so now prepare yourself, Heaven knows with what temper of mind he may meet you. But possibly you regret that you wrote at all, and now wish to fulfil your engagement. Oviedo. Yes, by taking to my heels. Call. Pray what do you suppose will be the consequence of your conduct to Leonora 1 Oviedo. Death, or a fever at least. Call. And you feel no compunction for this diabolical conduct? Oviedo. Patience, patience ! Do I command, or even solicit, the ladies to love me ? Call. True, true \u2014 I had forgotten, it is that charming person of yours \u2014 it is nature we must condemn.

You have no idea that the lady can pos sibly prefer any other ? Oviedo. Pshaw! you really grow quite an old woman. Call. It may be so, and I have brought an old woman's story with me, that will not a little surprise you. In the first place to begin, the charming Leonora has really run away \u2014 \u2014 . Oviedo. To meet me of course. Call. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! Oviedo. Why the man is mad ! Call. Don Sebastian is in pursuit, despairing and distracted, having as yet no tidings. Oviedo. But hopes to find her in my arms? Call. Ha, ha, ha! I presume you have heard of the house of Valentia ? Oviedo. Some years ago I was very intimate with the heir at law. Call. Ha, ha, ha ! There are several families of that name. Oviedo. Will you be pleased to go on with your old woman's story. Call. Certainly, certainly ! Well, Leonora, in her flight to the Convent of La Guarda, where she intended to take the veil, to escape everlastingly a marriage with the Count Oviedo, accidentally met with this same Valentia ; [Oviedo shrugs up his shoulders in unbelief] he has twice rescued her from the hovering banditti at the risk of his life.

You may very well imagine, that the amiable Leonora has, in consequence, become very much interested in the person to whom she and her family are so much obliged. Oviedo. Gratitude, of course, for so many benefits. Call. Added to this she returns to her father, bringing her brother in her hand, to solicit a recom pense for the brave Valentia \u2014 the reward she intends him is her own incomparable self. Oviedo. Excellent ! excellent ! Egad you shall write a second Don Quixote : pray go on. Call. This young man, on returning from his native country was shipwrecked ; he has also brought tidings of the family of the lord Alvarez. You may perhaps recollect, that Leonora was once be trothed to the son of the exiled lord, but as it has been presumed that he never will return to Spain \u2014 Oviedo.

W ITH all due deference to that most sapient, and, certainly, most useful class of the literary world, the critics, the writers of reviews, &c, I have to observe, that, perhaps, there are few authors or artists, who on coolly considering any work they may have finished, cannot perceive its defects, equally with those whose occupation is criticism. Grant, indeed, that the genius of the artist is one thing, and the judgment of the critic another; yet no thing in this world is so easy, as to descry existing defect ; it is true, too, that the will to perform is having only half the power to execute, and that in possessing the skill to take away a bad agent, we often want address to supply a better. Again, as every good action is susceptible of vicious inter pretation, inspected through the microscopes of \" envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness,\" so will there be parts in the most brilliant works susceptible of the shafts of misrepresentation, ridi cule, and condemnation : \u2014 The sun has specks, which every fool may see, Yet, in these seeking, he will dazzled be."], [292, "270 CONCLUDING REMARKS. Sometimes a poor author flatters himself that the errors which he himself perceives, may escape the notice of others ; this is, of all hopes, the most vain ; he feels he is not expected to lay before the public an account of his own discrepancies ; never- theless he may be assured, that there is no chance of escape for him, but in the very nothingness of his performance \u2014 he has entered a field where there is no respect of persons, no extra complaisance to- wards the lady-candidates. For myself, screened in the panoply of my own conscious insignificance, I presume on escaping all fearful condemnation ; unless, indeed, there should happen to be an un- heard-of barren season in the land of letters, then, perhaps, for mere idle pastime, and in something like vexation of spirit that nothing better has blossomed on the bourn, they will run over the pages, and say of KEEP YOUR TEMPER! \" The author of this Comedy, I suppose we must call it, has, at least, been very happy in the choice of a title to her work, and we hope she will keep her temper, whilst we condescend to make a few remarks on her Play, the end of which has cer tainly no correspondence with the beginning ; we are led from the first scene to presume a conse quence from the sanguine expectations of a young,"], [293, "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 271 ardent, and impassioned mind, entering with avidity the great world, of which it had formed to itself ideas, perhaps, of the most extravagant kind : but of the expected moral, of the disappointments we had looked for, of the accomplishment of an anxious father's predictions, we find nothing ; it is true that these predictions flow rather from the consciousness of guilt in the bosom of the parent, from the dread, that usually attends evil deeds, of their punishment, than from a just apprehension of the dangers of the gay world \u2014 we suspect she sat down with the idea of manufacturing some thing of this sort, but getting entangled on the outset, not knowing how to proceed in, much less finish, the projected course, she has turned into another road, and brought us by a cross path into a common-place sort of love story. There is also an under-plot, which seems a little irrelevant to the first design, though it certainly winds in, and connects tolerably with the second ; Sir John Aubrette undertakes to correct the failings of his wife, by preserving his patience, his temper unchanged, his perseverance unrelaxing ; he cer tainly would convince us, that by constantly op posing capricious folly with reason, and good humour, we may in the end correct it ; yet finally it is not so much all this which effectually produces the desired change, as the supposed self-destruction of young Gilbert \u2014 we felt ourselves rather alarmed at the liberal use our author makes of pistols, they"], [294, "272 CONCLUDING REMARKS. are lying about, tumbling down, and cracking off at every corner ; it gave us some regret, too, to find the Bow Street officers called in amongst a party of happy young lovers, but she, no doubt, thinks pre- vention better than cure, and to guard a lady from being run away with, a more consistent measure than sending an armed force after the party, when, perhaps, eighty miles on the road to Gretna ; and as after all these official gentlemen did not appear, being in previous requisition, we suppose we must not say any more on that subject \u2014 the servants are a very busy set of people, who pretend to have a great deal to do, whilst in reality they do nothing ; this we will admit frequently occurs in great houses \u2014 two of them, we presume, are near relations, they appear to have precisely the same sort of tastes and habits, particularly that of making long speeches, nobody being present to hear them. But let us proceed to the most remarkable part of this publication, the Introductory Discourse ; the dead man's commendation of this comedy ; surely this part of the story supersedes anything, and everything that ever came from the living ; we do not pretend to say that such a letter never was re ceived, but at the best, we can only call it an error of judgment ; we are, however, completely shut out from all inquiry into the truth in this case, and certainly the author would have been equally safe with us, had the name of this complimentary"], [295, "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 273 manager been given, so indisputable it is, that the grave is silent, that no reference can be taken in such a court, no cheat of this kind discovered, which, after all, is, as we have already said, a mere matter of opinion ; the concluding part of the eulogium, no doubt the very best, is suppressed ; this may be called a little affectation of modesty \u2014 we might as well have had the whole story, for availing ourselves of her own very a-propos simile, how should quacks sell their medicines, unless they can give us certain proofs that Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Black, &c, have swallowed their pills \u2014 we have not time to waste in continuing to point out a hundred other faults which we perceive ; we will, therefore, take our leave of this article, by candidly saying that we do not think the reading of it will poison any body's mind, and if it is trash, it is not spun out into four long volumes ; finally, whatever we chuse to say, the author seems determined to respect herself and her work, possibly on account of some motives which have led her to appear before the public, and with which she may think we have as little to do as she with the Reform Bill.

OF THE FATE OF IVAN. The writer of an historical play, tho' he has his subject prepared for him, experiences, perhaps, more difficulty to perfect his work, than one who pourtrays from his imagination solely ; or than one who draws from some ready-made romance. If he attach himself to the truth, in which the virtue of the historic page consists, he almost necessarily deviates from the rules prescribed to dramatic writers, and, consequently, may become defective in stage effect, in interest, and in execution. If, on the contrary, he here give the reins to his fancy, he may be stigmatized for his disregard of plain facts, and contempt of the supreme certainty of past positive existence. For my own part, I have adhered very closely to the plain matter of fact throughout ; probably, because I found it most con venient \u2014 in one or two unimportant circumstances, I have deviated \u2014 as, for instance, I have sent Baron Korf to the fortress of Schusselberg with Prince Ivan, and thought I might allow him to die there,"], [297, "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 275 for most authors say, it is very uncertain what did become of him ; but from his very great age, it may be inferred that he did not long survive the revolution \u2014 with regard to the ignorance of Princess Dashkoff' respecting Catharine's amours, it is well known that the Empress long succeeded in de ceiving her nearest friends on these subjects, and that the Princess Dashkoff, tho' the principal actress in the revolution, tho', in every other respect, the confidante of Catharine, had not for a length of time any suspicion of the private intrigues of the court. The visit of the Czar to Prince Ivan, is treated almost verbatim, and the councils were called at Peterhoff in train as narrated.
