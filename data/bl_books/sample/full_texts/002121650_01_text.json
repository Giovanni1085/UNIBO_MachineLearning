There is a cant in every thing. The Senate, the Bar, the Pulpit have their own peculiar cant, nor is Poetry free from the taint of the age. How- ever we are now* beginning to break the shackles of that great poetical necro mancer, Pope, and to discover that the music of verse, and the uniformity of rhyme are not synonymous terms.

He is the Poussin, and often the Claude; Byron, the Salvator Rosa, and Moore (delici ous Moore) the Titian of Poets. Even among the most highly coloured of Moore's productions (his Little's Poems for instance) the most beautiful and simple strokes of nature are perceptible. * Among the greatest admirers of Wordsworth is Mr. Leigh Hunt, (I he Editor of the Examiner, and the Author of Rimini,) who in my humble opinion isa Man of taste and genius, and possesses an independent spirit which does him the highest honour.

It is indeed \" a perpetual feast of nectar 'd sweets where no crude surfeit reigns.\" I do not presume to say that Pope is no Poet ; he is a very great Poet, but I do not admire him as a model for imitation.
