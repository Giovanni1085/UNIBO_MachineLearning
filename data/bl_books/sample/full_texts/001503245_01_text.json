I preface the Second Edition with this letter, which appeared in the Athen\u00e6um, February 17, 1866 :\u2014 Bain and Rivers. \u2014 In the Journal of the Geological Society, published in November last, Messrs. Foster and Topley, of the Government Geological Survey, attribute the denudation of the Weald Hill to ' Eain and Eivers.' More than this, there appears to be a strong tendency to the ' Eain and Eiver ' theory among the young practi cal geologists of the Government Survey (who have no theories of their own to defend), whether in England, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, or India. So far so good. Great A is accomplished ; but there is still a great B to be learnt. The great B is, that man and mammalia, that is, the most perfect creatures, may have existed on the land from the beginning, and before the first strata were formed in the sea, and consequently that Dar winism and the ' development ' theory are myths. The entire surface of the earth is covered with soil. That soil is rotted subsoil. Owing to atmospheric disinte gration, soil is in constant formation over the entire surface of the earth. Owing to the erosion of ' Eain and Eivers,' that soil is in constant movement down the"], [10, "VI PREFACE. hill-side to the valley, and along the valley to the sea. The land, then, is the region of perpetual disintegra tion, denudation and destruction. The sea is the region of perpetual deposit and conservation. And sea strata, when hoisted up by heat in the form of slate, sandstone, limestone, __c, form museums of sea life of an antiquity quite incomprehensible to man. But these museums contain sea life only ; land animals neither live nor die in the sea ; they live and die on the land. And w*here are the museums for the preservation of ancient land life ? There cannot be such a thing. The entire surface of the earth is perpetually vanishing, and with it the museums for the preservation of ancient land life. The most ancient museums of land life are caverns, filled-up lakes, and drift and alluvium \u2014 things which, speaking geologically, were formed yesterday, and will be gone to-morrow. In these modern land museums, however, the remains of man and mammalia are found, and they would be found in more ancient land museums, if such ancient land museums could exist. In the Geological Magazine of January last, page 2, the editor tells us that, ' Foraminifera of the present day form no less than 95 per cent, of the ooze covering the floor of the wide Atlantic ocean.' Suppose our present continents to be destroyed or submerged, \u2014 And where the Atlantic rolls wide continents shall bloom ; \u2014 that is, suppose that this ' floor of the wide Atlantic ocean,' turned into slate, shall be raised up as the Silurian slates have been : is the geologist of after ages to dub this Foraminifer the Eozoon Atlan ticon, and to inform his pupils that it was almost the sole existent animal of the period of that deposit,"], [11, "PREFACE. VII I instead of the place of that deposit ? That is, that from the beginning of the world up to the 19th century inclusive, Foraminifera were the dominant race on this terraqueous globe ? Yet this is the argument of our present geologists as regards the Eozoon Canadense, the Oldhamia Antiqua, and the Silurian Trilobites. The whole affair is the result of the most childish confusion between space and time, between place and period. That is because in the deposit of a certain place such a life only existed, we set it down that in the period of that deposit that life only existed.

Lyell writes of Werner : ' When sound opinions had thus for twenty years (fifty centuries) prevailed in Europe (the world), . . . Werner (Lyell), by his simple dictum, caused a retrograde movement, and not only overturned the true theory but sub stituted for it one of the most unphilosophical that can be well imagined.' n"], [22, "2 LYELL'S FOUR CONTRADICTORY [Ch. I. Lyell's own particular theory of the formation of valleys. In reference to the theory that valleys are formed by ' rain and rivers,' these words of Lyell are true of himself as I have altered them. There is, perhaps, no creed of man which, like this, can be traced up to the most remote antiquity, and traced down from the most remote antiquity to the present day. LyeU has himself quoted Bytha goras for it, through the medium of Ovid : Eluvie mons est deductus in \u00e6quor. Quodque suit campus vallem decursus aquarum Fecit. But Bythagoras only enunciates the doctrine of Eastern antiquity ; that is, of the Egyptians, the Chald\u00e6ans, and the Hindoos. But since Bytha goras introduced this doctrine in the West, if it has ever slumbered, it has been perpetually re originated. Lyell shows that among the Greeks it was taught by Aristotle ; among the Bomans by Strabo ; among the Saracens by Avicenna ; in Italy by Moro, Generelli, and Targioni ; and in England by Bay, Hutton, and Blayfair. In contradiction, however, to these authorities, ancient and modern, \u2014 in contradiction, as I think, to common sense, and in contradiction to three other theories which he himself uses, \u2014 Lyell has started a theory of his own in reference to the formation of valleys. He conceives, that as land has been slowly raised through the sea and above"], [23, "3 Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. Origin of allu vial plains. it by subterranean heat, the waves and currents of the sea have formed the valleys. In the second edition of the ' Tree-lifter,' I answered, ' That the action of waves on land slowly emerging from the deep should have a tendency to wash away soft parts and to leave hard parts, I can conceive ; but to attribute the formation of our valleys to this cause, is to sup pose that the materials of all the valleys running from the tops of all the heights on the globe were originally softer than the materials of the inter vening ridges ; but in almost all cases we can see that this is not so, by the corresponding strata on the opposite sides of valleys. In regard to currents : a current might decapi tate a continent as it rose, supposing equal softness of materials, or it might scoop a horizontal groove of any size or depth, or (granting lines of hard intervening ridges) many grooves. But they must all be horizontal, and in one direction. No marine current could make a single channel sloping from a height to the sea ; still less the myriads on myriads of dry upper valleys which ramify in all directions, from all river valleys, through and to all sides of the tops of all elevations, whether high or low. The sea ends every valley, but it never yet began one. That is, when the river has done its B 2"], [24, "4 LYELL'S FOUR CONTRADICTORY [Ch. 1. utmost, it is the sea which prevents the farther deepening of the valley. But as the denudation and deepening of the inclined upper parts continue, the lower part of the valley becomes horizontal. The passage of the detritus of the upper parts is then checked in this horizontal part, and soil ac cumulates there backward up the valley. This is the origin of alluvial plains, which I have never seen an attempt to account for. They seem, by common consent, to be omitted in all theories of the formation of valleys. Alluvial plains are, however, frequent features over the globe, and most important features. Yet neither the forma tion of any of them nor the present and perpetual daily growth of each of them, can be accounted for except by the principles Avhich I advocate. And instead of the sea forming valleys in the land, valleys often form land in the sea, that is, deltas ; and, as the sea by checking the longi tudinal rush of rivers allows this deposit of land forward in it, the sea may thus be said to assist in prolonging valleys. ' Bottle off the sea' and all estuaries, and their valleys will be deepened ; for the tidal part of each river will be a torrent on the brow of a mountain. In this case deltas and alluviums would disappear ; but they would not ' go with a run,' or by the direct action of rivers. Bivers would only cut"], [25, "Ch. I.] THEORIES OF FORMING VALLEYS. 5 ravines through them backward from the sea, the rest must wait for disintegration and the wash of rain. The sea begins the deltas and alluviums and preserves them now. And in this sense the sea may be said to fill valleys in, instead of scoop ing them out. This subject will be treated in the last chapter. But besides this No. 1 theory of his own, which I shall call the submarine theory, Lyell freely adopts three other theories, each of them contra- dictory to his own theory, and each contradic- tory to the other. No. 2, a theory of Mr. Hopkins's that valleys are cracks formed in the igneous elevation of the land, and Lyell says that Mr. Hopkins accounts for these ' by mathematical methods ;' I shall call this the igneous mathematical theory. No. 3, the erosion of their banks by rivers, the erosion theory ; and No. 4, the subaerial denu- dation from disintegration and the wash of rain, the subaerial theory. All these four theories Lyell uses, sometimes each as if it was his only theory, and always each as if it were consistent with the other three. Indeed, I think I shall show that a fifth and a sixth theory for the formation of valleys may fairly be placed to Lyell's credit (or discredit ?) Let us try if one theory will not suffice : the last of the four, the subaerial theory ; and if in"], [26, "6 lyell's four contradictory [Ch. I. Valleys formed according to three out of four of Lyell's theories should be bare of soil. Valleys are rich in soil. supporting this theory against the three first, arguments are sometimes used against all three generally, and sometimes the fight is shifted abruptly from one particular theory to the other, the blame must not be laid on the writer of this. If either of the first three theories were true ; if valleys were formed by submarine denudation, either by waves or currents ; or if they were formed by ' mathematical earthquakes,' or by the erosion of their banks by rivers, in all these cases valleys ought to be more bare of soil than any other parts of the earth. But they are more rich in soil than any other parts of the earth. Soil is simply rotten subsoil (mixed with vege table remains). But there are particular spaces so steep (precipices) that even gravity or wind, in dependent of the wash of rain, would never suffer a grain of soil to remain on them for an instant. Soil is not the less in perpetual formation on these spaces. The faces of precipices and bare rocks rot, and thus soil is in perpetual formation over the whole surface of the earth. And from the Avhole surface of the earth it is in perpetual move ment, by the wash of rain to the bottom of the sea. This travelling rotten part of the earth is the only part which supports vegetable existence, and consequently animal existence. The reason why valleys are richer in soil than"], [27, "Ch. I.] 7 theories of forming valleys. Accumulation of man's sub sistence and therefore man's existence greatly dependent on accumulation of soil. other parts of the earth, is, that they are the roads which soil travels to the sea. And the same cause which has excavated valleys, and which still denudes them \u2014 rain \u2014 also deposits in them. And valleys always hold soil as rivers always hold water, though the soil and the water are both in transitu. Directly as each valley lengthens, its longitudinal slope becomes gentle. Directly as it widens, its lateral slope becomes gentle. And directly as the gentleness of the slope of each valley is the accumulation of sod. For as rain takes the soil from the hill-top down the valley to the sea, in proportion to the flatness of the valley will deposit of soil exceed denu- dation. Man's subsistence, and therefore his existence, depend very much on these vast accu- mulations of sod. And therefore (I was going to say) it is of infinite consequence to man to know the principles on which depend the forma- tion, accumulation, and denudation of soil. But man \u2014 ' poor hungry sinner ' \u2014 does not wait for his dinner till he is shown where to get it by a scientific theory. He finds by practice where he can grow the crops which support him and his domestic animals. There are, however, infinite myriads of cases where denudation of soil may be retarded by man, and where accumulation of soil may be facilitated by him, if the true principles"], [28, "8 lyell's four contradictory [Ch. I. on which these depend are understood. And so far the knowledge of these principles may be said to be of consequence to us all, quicunque terr\u00e6 munere vescimur, from the labourer to the throne, sive reges sive inopes erimus coloni. But besides our food, besides producing and supporting the vegetable crops and animals most valuable to man, alluvial deposits are the maga zines of the minerals most valued by man. Bla tina, gold (5500/. worth has been picked up in one nugget), tin, diamonds, and precious stones, are sifted, sorted, and stored by Nature hi these beds, during her universal operations of disin tegration, denudation, and deposit.

In reference to Lyell's own submarine theory of forming valleys, I had inteuded to ex tract from the beginning of his ' Elements,' 2nd edition, to the end of his ' Brinciples,' 7th edition, all passages contradicting that theory in particular, or each other generally. I found that I became"], [31, "Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 11 far too voluminous. For the questions of denu- dation in the formation of valleys, and of deposit in the formation of all strata, alluviums, and drift-beds are of such universal and constant occurrence and recurrence in geology, that there is scarcely a page in Lyell's works in which he will not be found an unwilling and unintentional witness against his own submarine theory, and in favour of the common-sense plan of forming valleys by ' rain and rivers.' But though I have thus been obliged to curtail my extracts, I have still retained my original order of operations. Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. In reference to the formation of the parallel terraces of Glen Boy, Lyell (' Elements,' chap, vii.) concurs in these words with ' Dr. M'CuUoch, Sir T. D. Lauder, Mr. Darwin, and Mr. Agassiz. There is one point, however, on which all are agreed, namely, that these shelves are ancient beaches, or littoral formations, accumulated round Terraces of Glen Roy prove enormous denudation in former times."], [32, "[Ch. II. 12 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY the edges of one or more sheets of water, which once stood at the level, first of the highest shelf, and successively at the height of the two others. It is well known that, wherever a lake or fiord exists surrounded by steep mountains, subject to disinte gration by frost or the action of torrents, some loose matter is washed down annually, especially during the melting of snow, and a check is given to the descent of the detritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake.' Now here is a denudation not longitudinal, or, as Lyell has just said, from ' the action of torrents,' or, as Professor Sedgwick would say, ' acting on lines,' but lateral. It is a denudation of an enor mous breadth of hOR-side. For, as Lyell says, these terraces extend ' over a space of many leagues in length,' and ' they are from ten to sixty feet broad.' And it is not, as Lyell has said, that ' a check is given to the descent of the detritus at the point where it reaches the waters of the lake,' but that all denudation ceases there. Subaqueous regions are indeed the regions of deposit, as subaerial regions are the regions of denudation. But deposit takes place at the bottom, not at the top of water ; and these terraces are not formed by the accumu lation of deposit, but by the absence of denudation compared with the parts above them.

' detritus,' from the denudation instead of being arrested ' at the point where it reached the waters of the lake, went to the bottom of the lake, and has long since been cleared out of the valley by the same power which brought it in to the valley \u2014 rain. If these philosophers are all agreed (and who will disagree with them?) that this enormous denudation of the hill-sides and tops took place in former days, should they not give us some reason why it should have ceased in these days ? This was so printed in 1857, but since that time the once sane Lyell has gone into all the insanities of glacialism ; and he now requires ' ice-dams,' to turn the water back the wrong way, over the water-partings or so called cols ! And since that time I have had the pleasure on the ISth Septem ber, 1863, to walk up Glen Boy, and I published the followin_>* in the Athen\u00e6um. ' I think that these terraces are not the remains of shores of any kind, either sea-shores or lake-shores. They are the remains of ' patches of alluvial plains.' Years ago (' Bain and Eivers,' page 4 of this edition), I described at length the birth, life, and death of these transitory alluvial plains. But I was not till now aware of their disposition to set up their own gravestones. Shortly, these alluvial patches come and o*o thus. Every barrier of hard rock which"], [34, "14 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN ROY crosses the bed of a river or valley becomes a negative key to the depth of the river and valley above the barrier. Thus deep shalt thou go and no deeper. But as denudation is ever at work, the bed of the river and of the valley above the barrier become horizontal at the same level as the barrier. The flood waters are checked at the barrier, overflow the horizontal plain, and form an alluvial patch. The barrier sinks from erosion. The alluvial patch is no longer overflowed. The river is confined between walls of its own building. It sets to work to tear them down. It carries off the alluvial patch which it had deposited till it leaves only two terraces against the hill-sides. Having cleared a horizontal plain below the level of these terraces and at the new level of the barrier, the river again floods over and begins a new allu vial patch below the two parallel terraces. We only want eyes to see that parallel terraces are being formed in this way, at this instant, along the beds of Glen Boy and Glen Spean, and these recent terraces are composed of the same materials as the ancient ones. In Lyell's elements two of these lower terraces by the river side are actually delineated. But I was thoroughly astonished at the multiplicity of terraces with which the hill sides are scored. From Sir T. Dick Lauder's draw ing, and Mr. Jamieson's map given in Lyell's"], [35, "Ch. IL] 15 AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. ' Antiquity of Man,' one would suppose that there were at most three terraces. So that one must imagine the valley to have been emptied of water or hollowed out of the land at three swoops \u2014 at a hop, a step, and a jump. Whereas the name of the terraces is legion. Looking from the inn door at Boy-bridge on your right is a very broad terrace on which stands the farm of Achderrig. Follow the road towards Bohinnie along the side of this terrace, you will find it cut into several minor terraces, each with its corresponding terrace on the other side of the valley. As you walk up Glen Boy you are always accompanied by from five to ten terraces ever beginning, ever-ceasing. They are in every stage of existence and of vanish ment. In some places it may happen that on one side of the valley the terrace is only faintly delineated, or perhaps obliterated, while on the opposite side there is a large patch of alluvial plain still left. That no writer should have mentioned the multiplicity of these terraces, is to me wholly unaccountable. For it is the ' open sesame ' of the secret of the formation of the terraces, besides showing the extreme gradualness of the erosion and formation of the valley. If any one wishes to see the causes which formed our valleys still hard at their work, let him visit Glen Boy and Glen Spean. I do not doubt that terraced alluvial"], [36, "16 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY [Ch. II. Lake of Au vergne first filled with al patches are very general affairs, and that indica tions of them, more or less clear, will be found in all river valleys which have rapids or gorges.' Any one may make ' parallel terraces,' for him self in the road-side gutter. Dam the run of rain ; a pool will form above the dam. Every rain will deposit on the bed of the pool, till the flat alluvium rises to the height of the dam. Take away the dam. The run of rain cuts through the alluvium which it has deposited, and runs between two parallel terraces till they vanish by denudation. This is the whole secret of the terraces of Glen Boy or of any other valley or river. Neither ' ice dam,' nor ' glacial epoch,' nor sea-shore, nor lake is required. Dr. Adams found such deposits at the second cataracts of the Nile, 130 feet above its present bed. The principle of the formation of the bluffs of the Mississippi, the loess of the Bhine and Danube, the terraces of the Somme, &c, may be exactly shown in the wayside puddle. But from the above and from what follows, one would think that Lyell supposes denudation of hills only to go on in the neighbourhood of sheets of water and lakes, that is, ' wherever a lake or fiord exists ; ' and that, when the sheets of water have vanished, or the lakes have been filled up, the denudation ceases. For he describes (' Elements,' chapter xvi.) the filling up of the enormous ancient"], [37, "17 Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. luvium, then cut into hills and valleys by rain and rivers. lakes of Auvergne by the denudation and deposit from the wash of rain. But he neglects to infer that the same denudation must still go on there, and deposit from that denudation somewhere ; and that this denudation of land and deposit in water must pervade the entire terraqueous globe. Bage 362, he writes : ' Before entering on any detafls, I may observe, that the study of this region, and of the others above alluded to, possesses a pecidiar interest, very distinct in kind from that derivable from the investigation either of the Barisian or English tertiary strata.' (One cause of ' peculiar interest ' is, that the deposits have been inland ; that is, by comparison, on land, and therefore contain the fossils of the animals which inhabited the land.) 'For we are presented in Auvergne with the evidence of a series of events of astonishing mag nitude and grandeur, by which the original form and features of the country have been greatly changed, yet never so far obliterated but that they may still, in part at least, be restored in imagina tion. Great lakes have disappeared ; lofty moun tains have been formed by the reiterated emission of lava, preceded and followed by showers of sand and scori\u00e6 ; deep valleys have been subse quently furrowed out through masses of lacustrine and volcanic origin.

There was first a period when the spacious lakes, of which we stiU may trace the boundaries, lay at the foot of mountains of mode- rate elevation, unbroken by the bold peaks and precipices of Mont d'Or, and unadorned by the picturesque outline of the Buy de Dome, or of the volcanic cones and craters now covering the granitic- platform. During this earlier scene of repose, deltas were slowly formed ; beds of marl and sand several hundred feet thick deposited; siliceous and calcareous rocks precipitated from the waters of mineral springs ; shells and insects imbedded, together with the remains of the cro- codile and tortoise, the eggs and bones of water- birds, and the skeletons of quadrupeds, some of them belonging to the same genera as those entombed in the gypsum of Baris. To this tranquil condition of the surface succeeded the era of volcanic eruptions, when the lakes were c 2"], [40, "20 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN ROY drained and when the fertility of the mountainous district was probably enhanced by the igneous matter ejected from below, and poured down upon the more sterile granite. During these changes which appear to have taken place in the miocene epoch, the mastodon, rhinoceros, elephant, tapir, hippopotamus, together with the ox, various kind of deer, the bear, hy\u00e6na, and many beasts of prey, ranged the forest, or pastured on the plain, and were occasionally overtaken by a fall of burning cinders, or buried in flows of mud, such as accompany volcanic eruptions. Lastly, these quadrupeds became extinct, and gave place to the existing creation. There are no signs during the whole time required for this series of events of the sea having intervened, nor of any denudation which may not have been accomplished by currents in the different lakes, or by rivers and floods accompanying repeated earthquakes, during which the levels of the district have in some places been materially modified, and perhaps the whole upraised relatively to the surrounding parts of France.' Notwithstanding that 'there are no signs of the sea having intervened,' Lyell says that these ' lacustrine strata, which must have filled a hollow, have been denuded and shaped out into hills and valleys on the site of the ancient lakes.'"], [41, "Ch. II.] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 21 This is con trary to the submarine and in favour of the subaerial theory. Here Lyell is not only in direct contradiction to his submarine theory of the formation of vaUeys, but also to his anti-catastrophe system, and his ' causes now in operation ' system ; and observe how he changes from one agent to the other. ' During the earlier scenes of repose ' he fills his lakes with deposits, and his deposits with fossils, by ' causes now in operation.' But when volcanoes come on the scene to fill the lakes with deposits, he calls in ' currents in the different lakes, and floods accompanying repeated earth quakes ;' though, as we shall see hereafter, active volcanoes are safety-valves against earth quakes. His very fossds are now entombed by fire instead of water ; that is, when they are ' occasionally overtaken by a fall of burning cinders, or buried in flows of mud, such as ac company volcanic eruptions.' Then, to drain the lakes, he darkly refers to 'the era of vol canic eruptions when the lakes were drained.' But a little after he says : 'The subterranean movements may then have continued until they altered the relative levels of the country, and caused the waters of the lakes to be drained off, and farther accumulation of regular freshwater strata to cease.' But he forgets that he had already dammed the water out of the lakes by sediment ; and with regard to ' the relative levels"], [42, "22 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN ROY Why valleys grow wider as they descend. of the country,' the Loire and the Allier still run through the deposits where the lakes were, qua Troja suit, with doubtless no farther altera tion of level than the enormous one produced by these rivers themselves and rain. But for the shaping of these deposits 'into hills and valleys ' after ' the lakes were drained,' Lyell gives no reason at all. But grant subaerial denudation and deposit, and the filling in of the lakes with drift and alluvium, the storing these with fossils of land animals, and the cutting of valleys through the deposits, are all matters of course and plane sailing. The wash of rain and rivers first fill the ancient lakes with drift and alluvium, and the same floods which form the drift store it with land animals. But while this was doing, and ever since it was accomplished, rain and rivers have been eroding the dams or barriers which originally formed the lakes. And as these barriers were gradually worn away, channels were cut longitudinally through the deposits which filled the lakes. Then come disintegration and the lateral wash of rain to widen these chan nels into valleys. And the lower parts of these valleys, speaking longitudinally, and the higher parts, speaking laterally, being gradually and in succession earlier exposed to these wasting causes,"], [43, "Ch. IL] AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. 23 supposing equal hardness of material, disappear earlier. This is the cause of the increasing width of valleys as they descend ; and the very excep tion proves the rule. For the different parts of the same valley are invariably wide directly as the softness of those parts, and narrow directly as their hardness. This would not be the case if valleys were igneous cracks. These causes are as hard at work now as ever they were. And in future ages rain and rivers will abstract from these valleys or ancient lakes every particle which in former ages they deposited there. This would not be the case if the Adriatic or any arm of the sea were filled up, because the sea would keep the mouths of the rivers at one level, and prevent them cutting channels through their own deposits. Many people consider a valley to be like a tea cup, or the happy valley of Basselas,* without an outlet. But valleys are like inclined troughs, open at the lower end. A valley is, in my opinion, a water-slope or a system of water-slopes, converging to one outlet at the sea. In the case of cups or crevices without outlets, formed in the original elevation of the land, rain instantly begins to * This was a mistake of mine in the first edition, the great Dr. Johnson contrived an outlet for the water of the Happy Valley."], [44, "24 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY [Ch. II. fill them with water and alluvium. Should either of these reach the lowest part of the brim, rain erodes that brim, makes an outlet, and proceeds to let off the water, or to clear out the aUuvium which it has before deposited. This holds true from the largest of the American lakes (for rivers are subterranean rain, that is, rain reappearing) to the smallest puddle on a road. In the first announcement in the papers of the great exploit of the indomitable explorer Captain Speke, it was stated on the authority of natives, that the Lake Nyanza had more than one outlet. I ventured to suggest that the native information would be found incorrect : and started the princi ple that owing to the erosion of the barrier or dam, a lake can only have one outlet. The principle was much discussed, and two lakes, Black Loch in Dumfries, and Loch Davie in Arran, were pointed to as having two outlets. I visited both, and reported that, me judice, each had only one outlet. As might be expected, the ancient alluviums formed in hollows on dry land are the grand museums of the remains of land animals, as strata deposited in the sea, though equally by the wash of rain from the land, are of the marine creation. I would here call attention to these facts, which I shall allude to again in the eighth"], [45, "Ch. II. ] 25 AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE.

And because land animals are only found in numbers in recent land deposits, it is a mistake to argue that they did not exist during the period of the deposit of the most ancient marine strata. The whole of the thirty-first chapter of the ' Elements ' seems written to disprove Lyell's own theory of the submarine formation of valleys, and to prove that they are formed by the subaerial denudation of rain and rivers. The following are extracts : \u2014 With regard to the Blomb du Cantal, which is a volcanic ' mountain several thousand feet in height,' and which has never been under the sea, and therefore should have no valleys : ' Valleys radiate in all directions from the natural heights of the mountain, increasing in size as they recede from those heights. Those of the Cer and Jour danne, which are more than twenty miles in length, are of great depth, and lay open the geological structure of the mountain.' Speaking generally, he says : ' The lavas may often be traced from the crater to the nearest valley, where they usurp the channel of the river, which has frequently excavated a deep"], [46, "26 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY [Ch.

We have thus an opportunity of contrasting the enormous degra dation which the solid and massive rock has suffered by aqueous erosion, and the integrity of the cone of sand and ashes, which has in the meantime remained uninjured on the neighbour ing platform, where it was placed beyond the reach ofthe power of running water.' With regard to the Buy de Come, a stream of lava fids ' the ancient river-channel for the dis tance of more than a mde. The Sioule, thus dispossessed of its bed, has worked out a fresh one between the lava and the granite of its western bank ; and the excavation has disclosed in one spot a wall of columnar basalt about fifty feet high. The excavation of the ravine is still in progress, every winter some columns of basalt being undermined and carried down the channel of the river, and, in the course of a few miles, rolled to sand and pebbles. Meanwhde, the cone of Come remains stationary, its loose ma terials being protected by a dense vegetation, and the hill standing on a ridge not commanded by any higher ground whence floods of rain water may descend. At another point, farther down the course of the Sioule,' ' the river has excavated a ravine through lava and subjacent gneiss to the depth of four hundred feet, On"], [47, "Ch.

The gravel again rests upon gneiss, which has been eroded to the depth of fifty feet. It it quite evident in this case, that whfle the basalt was gradually undermined and carried away by the force of running water, the cone whence the lava issued escaped destruction be cause it stood upon a platform of gneiss several hundred feet above the level of the valley in which the force of running water was exerted. The brim of the crater of the Buy de Bariou, near Clermont, is so sharp, and has been so little blunted by time, that it scarcely affords room to stand on. This and other cones, in an equally remarkable state of integrity, have stood, I con ceive, uninjured, not in spite of their loose porous nature, as might at first be naturally supposed, but in consequence of it. No rills can collect where all the rain is instantly absorbed by the sand and scori\u00e6.' Lyell here acknowledges the denuding power of rain where it can collect in rills. But the porousness of volcanic cones is not the sole reason, nor even the main reason, why rain cannot col-"], [48, "28 [Ch. II. TERRACES OF GLEN ROY lect on them. Their shape is the main reason. I endeavoured to show this in the second edition of the ' Tree-lifter.' I will give one more homely illustration of the theory here. Suppose a building five yards square, with a roof like a shed, spouted. All the rain falls into five yards of spouting. Shape the roof like a gable, the same shed of rain is dispersed over ten yards of spouting. Shape the roof like a four sided pyramid, the same shed of rain is dispersed over twenty yards of spouting instead of five. But cones and cairns have stfll greater power to disperse rain rills than flat-sided pyramids. And it is to their shape mainly that volcanic cones owe their comparative eternity. Com paratively eternal also is the truncation of their shape ; for this must remain till they are de nuded below the bottom of the crater \u2014 in many cases many hundred feet \u2014 they will then assume the point and appearance of a simple cone of denudation. Whde this denudation of the crater is going on, supposing equal hardness of material, the rim should remain sharp to the last, as Lyell describes many. How beautifully distinct at any distance is this form of the children of igneous up-throw, whose very uniformity makes variety amid forms result ing- from aqueous down-pour. But- to aqueous"], [49, "Ch. IT.] 29 AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. down-pour myriads of them have yielded, and are yielding, and comparative eternity is the most perennial claim which can be made to aught existing on a globe, the very being of every department of which, organic or inorganic, is dependent on perpetual change ; that is, on per petual disintegration and reproduction. In fact the tendency of disintegration and the wash of rain is to form cones out of single hills, and ridges out of chains of hills, with projecting spurs, each spur being itself a ridge ending in a half cone ; and even these ridges are so studded with cones as to have a serrated or saw-like outline, and to have earned the modern Spanish, Bortuguese, and Italian name of sierra or serra, and to have originated the Latin ex pression of per juga montium, the very name of hills being taken from the yoke-hke appearance of contiguous cones. And in this sense, rain may be said to form hills as well as valleys. For this reason, though as Sir Humphry Davy finely remarks, no work of a mortal can be im mortal, those works of man which approach nearest to immortality are cones, \u2014 the pyramid, the tumulus, and the cairn. Why do the irn ber edax and the fuga temporum pass with so light a touch over these? Because they begin with a form which others end in, \u2014 a form which"], [50, "30 [Ch. II.

Their comparative hardness is probably owing to the effect of the infiltration of water of petrifying power. Nature is a great- chemist, and always at work. Air and water together are her great disintegraters, neither of them singly. In dry air alone perish- able materials will remain unaltered for cen- turies, nay, thousands of years : and under water wood will retain the sharp edges of the car- penter's work for ages after the upper parts have been turned to powder under the action of the two powers. And it is astonishing to what a depth below the surface these two powers to gether will alter even the hardest rocks. They"], [51, "Ch. IL] 31 AND LAKES OF AUVERGNE. decay into soft mud, earth, clay, or sand. This happens on the surface. We see it and believe it. Some of us are rather hard of belief that these soft substances should become hard again under the surface ; that is, unless melted by heat or at least baked by heat like a brick. Yet the transformation of the soft into the hard without heat goes on under our eyes in nature and art dady. In art stucco, concrete, cement, plaster, and mortar, are daily formed. In nature petri fying springs turn the softest materials to the hardest in a few hours. Many springs deposit pure flint or limestone. The enormous areas over which water impregnated with iron has acted as a cement may be seen by the red and yellow colouring of strata. Blace a piece of iron in sand exposed to the elements, and it forms a mass of stone. By the action of heat the purest looking water daily encrusts our ket tles and cauldrons with intensely hard stone. But though Lyell describes these rocks as having ' a crystalline texture like marble,' he also describes them as being, even at this moment, suffering decay and disintegration, and as exhibit ing ' a white powdery surface,' and again as being ' in a state of slow decomposition, either exfoliating or being covered with powder, like the chalk cliffs on the English coast.'"], [52, "32 TERRACES OF GLEN ROY [Ch. II. To account for the rarity of these so-called marine inland cliffs, and for their intermittent character, Lyell says, 'secondly, that precipitous rocks have often decomposed and crumbled down ; and thirdly, ' that many terraces and small cliffs may now lay concealed beneath a talus of detrital matter.' Here we get subaerial denudation and its effects. And this is the true history of all de nudation. These taluses are of very constant occurrence, as I stated in the second edition of the ' Tree-lifter,' and may be shown where they do occur, because they are unstratified. But what formed them but subaerial denudation!1 Or in plain English, the decay of the faces of the precipices, or ' the run of the hills,' above them, or both. In general the phdosophic and the unphilo sophic are terribly put out by the powers here claimed for ' the wash of rain.' Yet when the word ' flood ' is used, they will allow you to wash away articles of any size or description, natural or artificial. A flood however, is simply the effect of rain, as ' the flood ' was the same. If oidy one year's rain could remain where it fell, the surface of the whole terraqueous globe would be covered a yard deep with fresh water.

Later in the day, in Calabria, we shall find the dose of earthquake made up with aqua pura that is, with ' running water,' or the erosion theory. In the original elevation of the Weald dis trict, the igneous action was strongest from east to west along the centre of the yellow Hastings sand, No. 5, where 'Forest Bange' is marked in the map ; so that it formed there what is called an anticlinal fine or axis ; that is, the beds or strata were raised highest along the ridge, and inclined or dipped, like a barn roof, both ways, to the north and south, whfle they stretched to the east and west. The conven tional term ' line of strike ' is a bad translation by sound instead of by sense, from the German streichen, and means line of stretch. The lips of the light blue Weald clay, No. 4, originally joined over this ridge of the Hastings sand ; those of the green lower greensand, No. 3, over the Weald clay ; those of the dark blue gault, No. 2, over the lower greensand ; and those of the light coloured chalk and upper greensand, No. 1, over the gault. Lyell \"thinks that the pink tertiary strata did not join over the chalk, because they may have been deposited from his favourite marine de nudation after the chalk was raised. He writes:"], [55, "London Lontpiiiin & C?"], [56, ""], [57, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 35 ' This idea receives some countenance from the fact of the tertiary strata, at their junction with the chalk and the London and Hampshire basins, often consisting of dense beds of sand and shingle, as the Addington hdls, near Croydon. They also contain occasionally fresh-water shells, and the remains of land animals and plants, which indicate the former presence of land at no great distance, some part of which may have occupied the centre of the Weald.' The very facts which Lyell here adduces to prove these beds to be the result of his favourite submarine denudation, I think prove them to be beds of drift, deposited on dry land, from subaerial denudation, that is, the wash of rain. This subject, under the head of drift and alluvium, will be considered in the fourteenth chapter. But as mistakes are constantly made between drift, alluvium, and tertiary strata, and as it is perhaps impossible strictly to distinguish between them, I will state here the sense to which I shall endeavour to confine myself when I use the words. Drift is coarser alluvium, driven along the surface by strong floods, and deposited on land, or left in valleys, where the finer materials have been washed away, in both cases unstratified. Alluvium is finer drift, par tially stratified, deposited on land, from materials D 2"], [58, "36 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. held in suspension by water running or standing for a time. The deposits of alluvial plains are alluvium, though enormous quantities of drift may be mingled with them. Tertiary strata are deposits from water in water ; but so are all new alluviums in the sea and in lakes. Nay, in lakes the deposits near the shores partake very much of the character of drift, beyond this of alluvium, and in the centre they are perfectly stratified. Where are we to draw the line in these cases ? and especially where are we to draw the fine between new alluvium in the sea and tertiary strata? There is, however, a clear line between deposits on land and deposits in water ; and to deposits on land I confine the words drift and alluvium. The enormous beds of drift and alluvium deposited on land, con- tiguous to river-courses, and resulting from the formation of valleys, &c, are constantly quoted as tertiary strata. I contend, however, that the lips of the pink tertiary strata must have joined over the chalk, making these strata of the London basin and the Hampshire basin continuous over the Wealden ridge (not valley). The Alton hills, which form the west border of the Wealden region, are still capped with the last remains of tertiary strata. And doubtless the so-called Druidical sandstones"], [59, "37 Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. and conglomerates of this otherwise chalk district are remnants of these tertiary beds. In the horse monument at the foot of Brook wood Hill, I brought the largest of the sandstones from the top of the clay-capped chalk ridge north of the road between East and West Meon. The next largest flat one I dug out from two feet below the surface of the drift-gravel on the east side of Bramdean. It may, perhaps, have never moved horizontally, or very slightly, but have been gra dually and constantly undermined during the ex cavation of the valley, and so let vertically down. A large stone so situated may be rounded by the passage of water, sand, and small stones in floods, and by the action of the atmosphere, and so assume the form of a huge boulder without having been itself moved. And where extensive regions of soft strata vanish by denudation, they will leave any accidental rocks or hard parts of their contents behind them in the form of huge boulders. To illustrate this in a small way : the drift at the bottom of one of our Hampshire deans or valleys may contain a sifted assortment of the contents of the whole mass which once was above the valley, as weU as ' the run of the hills ' which now form its sides ; so that, of two flints there lying in contact, one may be the untravelled,"], [60, "38 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch.

A large sandstone may be seen in the cutting for the road on the brow of Filmere Hid, between West Meon and Alton, with perhaps fifteen feet of clay above it. This is no bunch (in mining terms) of clay, but extends on all sides, except where valleys interfere. Indeed, I think it may be traced on the tops of the hills from the London to the Hampshire basin. At any rate, it extends in the direction of Froxfield, where many other such stones protrude from the clay, to the very border of the Wealden region. Since this was published I have added many of these stones to the horse monument. They were blown to pieces to get them out of the way of the owner's plough. They vary from the finest and purest sandstone to coarse conglomerate, and clearly show their sea-shore origin. They have been run together in nodules by water impregnated with iron flint or carbonate of lime, and in great storms have been washed out into the deep water where the clays were in deposit like the sand of the ' plastic clay and sand.' In the interior of these stones are many holes with loose sand and rounded pebbles which the petrifying water did not reach. Between Botherfield and Alton, in Brightstone"], [61, "Ch.

' The Weald Valley' no yalley but a hiU, (Brides. one)* Lane, is a collection of large conglo merate stones. The chalk hills of the opposite coast of France and Belgium, and the banks of the Seine in Nor mandy, are also still undenuded of their cap of tertiary strata ; and, according to my view, it is very probable that these strata of the Baris, the London, and the Hampshire basins once united over the chalk. But as we may almost say that the Weald is at the present time surrounded by tertiary strata, there is, I think, every presumption that in former times these strata covered this ' vadey of denudation,' as Lyell calls it. A more complete misnomer, however, could not be. Every valley, indeed, is a valley of denudation ; which denudation has passed out of the valley through a single outlet or waterslope. For it is an essential characteristic of valleys, trunk or branch, that * Brida, or Fraida, or Freia, or Friga, was the Saxon planet and Goddess Venus, who gave her name to Friday (dies Ve neris, Venerd'i).

III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 41 and its denu dation passes to two seas by numerous dis tinct trunk valleys. however infinite the tracery, and however count less the number of their ramifying upper inlets, each and every valley can have but one lower outlet. I speak as regards the flow of water and of denudation. But the Weald is no valley at all. If it is any one thing, it is the reverse of a valley. It is a hill with, if not a quaquaversal dip, at least a quaquaversal waterflow ; that is, its waterflow and denudation, like those of most other large hills, are carried to the sea by a great number of distinct trunk valleys. And actually the four southern valleys of this 'valley of denudation' discharge themselves into the English Channel, the five northern ones into the Thames and German Ocean, while the eastern Bother forms a delta of 60,000 acres under the name of Bomney Marsh. No one can cast his eye on the foregoing map, taken from Lyell's ' Elements,' without seeing this fact. But I add Mr. Martin's own particular sketch to show how, according to him, the ' Weald valley' consists of the very top of the 'Forest Ridges the exact summit which separates the north and south waterslopes, and which it is the present fashion to call a portage. And if anything can be the exact reverse of a valley, a portage is the exact reverse of a valley. The Humboldtian Keith Johnston explains the"], [64, "42 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. These valleys were made by rain and rivers not by the sea. meaning of the word portage. Navigators have there, he tells us, ' the advantage ' of being obliged to carry their vessels, as well as their cargoes, overland from the river on one side of the portage to the river on the other side. But whether the Weald hill was originally capped with tertiary strata or not, it is allowed by all that it was capped by the beds which I have enumerated from the chalk to the Hastings sand, and that these beds have vanished by denu dation. Therefore, before this prodigious denuda tion took place, and while it was taking place, the ridge above the ' Forest Bange ' was incomparably the highest ground in the region. Naturally, then, the waterflow, whether of the surface (rain and snow), or from under the surface (springs and rivers), would be from this highest point, the Forest Bidge, to the lowest point, the sea. And this waterflow is not only to the north and south, as represented by Mr. Martin ; it is to the east and west also. From Tilgate Forest there is a qua quaversal waterflow to the sea, by means of many different trunk valleys, formed and graduated by the wash of rain. And the courses of this water flow once made would be continued during the rise of the land, notwithstanding that, owing to a cause which will be explained, their starting-point might have been denuded some feet lower, not"], [65, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 43 Nor by mathe matieal earth quakes. than their beds, but than the heights through which their beds pass. That the main drainage of the Forest Bidge does pass through the North and South Downs, which are masses of uniform structure and hardness, is a fact which of itself proves that the waterflow made its own courses. The sea could not have made them unless their original contents had been softer than their sides. Mr. Martin, indeed, points out that the four southern rivers are exactly opposite the five northern rivers. And Mr. Hopkins proves, ' by mathematical methods,' that 'cross fractures' must have occurred where these nine rivers pass through the Downs. And Lyell agrees, that, owing to the loosening of the materials, the sea has been enabled to make the nine river-courses. But, first, any two points are opposite one another. But if we take the tortuous lines of the rivers, they are oppositer ; for they are opposite all the points of the compass. And as for the eight or nine 'cross fractures,' there is not a particle of evidence for the existence of any one of them. ' The pressure of superincumbent strata of un known thickness and kind, must also be taken into account ; and it will not be thought wonderful that diluvial action and the operation of more modern causes apart, there should be so little direct evidence of fissure upon the surface.'"], [66, "44 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. HI. Mr. Martin here talks of little evidence ; but he actually produces none whatever. It is true that a fracture and a faidt are claimed in the valley called ' the Coombe ; ' but there is no river there, nor is the fracture a ' cross fracture,' but a longitudinal fracture, running east and west, and in the line of one of several smaller anticlinal ridges, which are supposed on each side of the main Forest Bidge, and parallel to it. Supposing all these longitudinal fractures to have rivers as well as the cross ' fractures,' which on mathematical principles they should, To one who looked from upper air, what a pretty effect the symmetrical, fluvial reticulation would have ! like a net on a lady's head.

In almost the first words of the ' Cosmos,' Humboldt declares his intention to describe nature ' in exalted forms of speech.' He accordingly gives loose to a barbarous jargon of words, the mixture of verbis gr\u00e6ca latinis, which Demosthenes and Cicero together would be puzzled to interpret. I do not mean that he is singular in this. Such gaudy frippery may hide and cloke the deformity or weakness of the false, but can it deck or dignify truth and nature ?

It may be asked, Wiy then waste time on the ravings of madness ? and I beg pardon for doing so. But the reply is, that in discussing the theory of rivers and the formation of valleys, the opinions of Humboldt cannot be passed in silence, and particularly when (alas !) we find Lyell sharing in those opinions. Humboldt writes ( ' Cosmos, Fhysical Geo graphy ') : ' The main direction of the whole continent of Europe (from south-west to north east) is opposite to that of the great fissures which pass from north-west to south-east, from the mouths of the Bhine and the Elbe, through the Adriatic and Bed Seas, and through the mountain system of Futschi-koh, in Luristan, to wards the Bersian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. This almost rectangidar intersection of geodesic lines exercises an important influence on the commercial relations of Europe and Asia and the north-west of Africa, and on the progress of civi lisation on ihe formerly more flourishing shores of the Mediterranean ; ' that is, formerly Borne, Car- is not only useless, as it conceals the laws of nature (which are as simple as they are sublime) behind the double veil of Greek and Latin \u2014 it is a hideous iniquity, for it effectually shuts out from the vast majority of mankind truths which might be known and should be known by every man, woman, and child."], [68, "46 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. thage, Greece, Bh\u0153nicia, and Egypt, owed their civilisation to the ' great fissure ' formed by the Alps, the Bhine, and the Elbe. And to these we are indebted for the present '\u25a0progress of civilisa tion ' around the whole ' shores of the Mediterra- nean. But are there no rivers in Europe save these two German ones? The Dnieper would swallow both. And if the Spree and Botsdam had apper tained to the Dnieper instead of to the Elbe, perhaps the Vistula, the Dnieper, and the Black Sea would have formed the ' rectangular inter section of geodesic fines.' The Danube, which would also swallow both, and the Bo, are in the same line as ' the main direction of the whole continent of Europe.' And the Volga, which again would swallow both, and Don, form ' a rectangular intersection ' of Humboldt's ' great fissure.' The ' great fissure ' between the Adriatic and the Bhine is precisely the highest part of Europe \u2014 the Alps. But is the writer of ' Cosmos ' to consider ' the main direction ' of the land and water of Europe separately from that of the land and water of Asia (which contains how many of the largest rivers in the world), because man has divided this one continent into two by a difference of names?"], [69, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 47 On whichever side of high land the sea is, the waterflow must go to it. This is the sole and simple secret of the direction of rivers and val leys. And the principle applies to the inland seas and lakes of central Asia, as well as to the great oceans. If the sea is close to high land, as the Bacific to the Andes, an infinity of small streams run straight to it. If distant, as the Atlantic, the infinity of small streams, in seeking the sea, fall together, and form large rivers, col lecting as they go the waterflow of the regions through which they pass. Thus a long river is a strong river, because vires acquirit eundo, and it gets wider as it descends. But if river-courses were igneous cracks formed in the elevation of the land, these cracks of construction should get narrower as they descend, and they should die off to nothing at the sea. The crack of the Biver Blate is 170 miles wide at the sea; and, like all other rivers, instead of widening, as an igneous crack ought, it narrows as you proceed inland. I do not know what the width of the crack of the Amazons is at the sea, but it is three or four miles wide at the foot of the Andes, and there narrows to a few hundred yards. If you follow one stream, it narrows off to nothing, that is, to one spring. Does this one spring, with the spring on the opposite side of the mountains,"], [70, "48 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS. [Ch. III. form 'a great fissure' through the Andes from the Atlantic to the Bacific ? And so the thousand springs of the Amazons with their opposites a thousand ' great fissures ? ' If so, why do the western halves of these ' great fissures ' run straight to the Bacific sea, and their eastern halves converge to the trunk line of the Ama zons. Berhaps Mr. Hopkins will 'account for this by mathematical methods.' But if we con sider the entire head of the Amazons as one ' great fissure ' a thousand miles wide, how comes this fissure to be filled with the highest moun tains of the New World ? Take Europe and Asia as one continent, of which, in another page, Humboldt himself says, ' its major axis is almost parallel with the equa tor,' and are the rivers of China and the west of Europe at right angles with ' the main direction ' of the land? If we could jump mountains as easily as Humboldt does the Alps, we might crack the continent in the same line as its main direc tion, from the Loire or Tagus to the Yang-tse kiang, or Amour, by the rivers of the Black Sea and Caspian, or in any other direction we require. If we trace the ' great fissure ' from the \u00c6gean, by the Don and Volga, to the Oby, besides form ing ' a rectangular intersection ' with Humboldt's 'great fissure,' we might account for the high"], [71, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 49 state of civilisation of the Crimea and Siberia. If you jump from the Japanese, or from the Ira wady to the Yenesei, or to the Irtish branch of the Oby, you make a real Cosmical leap, and a ' great fissure ' well worthy of Humboldt, instead of his petty European Alpine hop. As every continent is surrounded by sea, any two rivers running from any height to opposite seas must form a great fissure,' if we may jump the height. If we trace any two rivers from opposite seas, to where they nearly meet at their sources, we come to a portage. Are a portage and a fissure synonymous ? I should say that a portage is the reverse of a fissure. It is at least the highest ground in the neighbourhood, if not on the continent. I am, however, straining at a gnat in not swal lowing these superficial transverse fissures, which pass Over and across mountain- tops. Now for the camel. Humboldt has seen so far into the mill stone as to discover that every mountain-chain is supported by a longitudinal fissure below it. In talking of earthquakes, he says : ' As mountain chains appear to be raised on fissures, the walls of the cavities may perhaps favour the direction of undulations parallel to them.' The great moun tain fissure of the New World extends from within the arctic circle to near the antarctic E"], [72, "50 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. circle \u2014 10,000 miles. If thermometers were sunk at intervals of 1000 miles through this fissure into the interior of the earth, we might arrive at valuable isogeothermal (Chthonisothermal) facts. The experiment might be first tried at the plain of Malpais, which, with Mount Jorullo at its centre, 1600 feet high, was raised by eruption in 1759. Humboldt ' attributed the convexity of the plain to inflation from below; supposing the ground, for four square miles in extent, to have risen up in the shape of a bladder to the elevation of 550 feet above the plain in the highest part.' * * Humboldt (Cosmos), quotes Plato, Aristotle, Pausanias, Strabo, and Ovid to prove that the inside and foundations of mountains are wind, and regrets that he cannot quote the non extant work of Theophrastus. He himself translates Ovid's description of the elevation of Mount Methone, in prose, thus : ' The heaving earth, inflated by the force of the compressed vapours, expands like a bladder filled with air, or like a goat skin. The ground has remained thus inflated.' In a note, Humboldt adds Dryden's poetical translation, which gives the mountain a pain in the stomach from flatulent colic : \u2014 ' Labours with colic pangs, and close confined, In vain sought issue for the rumbling wind.' Humboldt then gives Aristotle's own words for ' the rum bling wind' (cirepoc and irrevfia), and ends with Strabo's asser tion that, by day, it emitted a ' sulphureous stench, but by night evolved an agreeable odour.' Humboldt's commentary on Ovid is, 'this description of a dome-shaped elevation on the Continent is of great importance in a geognostical point of view.' And on Aristotle, ' in this description, the vesicular distension of the earth's crust, a stage at which many trachytic mountains have remained, is very well distinguished from the eruption itself And this is the modern Pythagoras, the Master by whose word science swears !"], [73, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 51 Or at home we might try it on the Weald hill, where, owing to denudation, we must be near the ' fissure ' of construction, or perhaps in this case the foundation would be another ' bladder.' But to return to the superficial fissures of the Weald. Of the Arun it may be said, that one of its arms runs from east to west ; another from west to east ; and its body from north to south. We cannot, then, deny that this river is opposite whatever river Mr. Martin pleases. Indeed, I am willing to concede that any one of the myriads of valleys branching from the Forest Bidge, or from the North or South Downs, or from the Alton Hills, is opposite to any other which Mr. Martin pleases ; though I should hesi tate to agree that any of these valleys resulted from fractures, cross or longitudinal. The western branch of the Arun (called the Bother \u2014 not that Bother flowing from the Forest Bidge eastward) rises at Nore Hill, near Bother field, in Hampshire. So does one branch of the Wey. And these two rivers have nothing to do with the drainage of the Forest Bidge, but merely receive the run of the south side of the North Downs, and of the north side of the South Downs, and so develope these two ridges behind the gorges ; an operation which will be alluded to at the end of this chapter. E2"], [74, "52 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. I presume that Mr. Martin will have some fracture, \u2014 either a longitudinal fracture, or a cross fracture, or a diagonal fracture, \u2014 for the little stream which rises near East Meon, above the F. of Betersfield in Lyell's map. It surely is oppo site the eastern arm of the Arun, or the western and the eastern Bother, and forms a ' great fis sure ' in the same line, and directly along the anticlinal axis of the Weald valley. Or else it is opposite one of the branches of the Wey, or else one of the tributaries of the Thames above Odi ham. However wedded I may be to my own theory, I cannot deny facts ; and Mr. Martin has only to say which of these rivers is opposite to this stream, and I can no more gainsay it than I can object to the conclusions drawn by Mr. Hop kins's ' mathematical methods.' Though I must say that I think that if Nature had drawn the lines of valleys by ' mathematical methods,' she would have ruled them straighter than Britannia rules the waves, or than the lines of actually ex istent valleys are. In Norway and Sweden, raised beaches show that the land is rising for the space of about 1000 miles. These beaches are found 600 feet above the sea. The present rate of rising is thought to be four feet in a century. If this had caused ' fissures ' or ' cross fractures,' they should not"], [75, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 53 only be existing now, but greatly widening. Yet there are no more fissures there than in any other system of valleys. It is needless to remark, that a rise of four feet in a century would in no way dis arrange the drainage of the country. And it has required all the sagacity of the greatest philoso phers to ascertain that this vast operation has taken place, and is still progressing. I must confess that I have not had an oppor tunity of examining these ' mathematical me thods ' of Mr. Hopkins's. But according to my mathematics, if the valleys of the river-courses of the Weald are igneous fissures, they should grow wider as they ascend. They should be widest at the top of the Forest Bidge, and should narrow off to nothing at the sea on the south, and at the Thames on the north, and this irrespective of comparative hardness of ground. The reverse of this is the case. Like any other waterslopes, these valleys \"start without any fissures at all ; that is, the run of the whole surface of the high grounds is first received into an infinity of coombs, which have no permanent streams ; and all these coombs, running from every direction, slope into a multi plicity of narrow valleys with rivulets, also running in every direction. And, like any other water slope or system of valleys, instead of narrowing, they widen as they descend, except where the"], [76, "54 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. The sea is eroding the coast of Sussex. ground is harder than the ground above it, that is, up stream of it. The reason for this will be given immediately. Lyell says : ' It is evident that these openings, so far at least as they are due to aqueous erosion, have not been produced by the rivers, many of which, like the Ouse, near Lewes, have filled up arms of the sea, instead of deepening the hollows which they traverse.' As these rivers have filled up arms of the sea, I have given a reason why they never can deepen their channels at the mouths as long as the sea and land keep their present relative level. More than this : instead of deepening their channels, they will build their banks and beds up higher than they are, as the rivers in alluvial parts of val leys always must at every overflow. But this subject will be considered in the last chapter. According to Lyell the sea is at present eroding the coast of Sussex. The following is from the ' Brinciples.' ' About a mile to the west of the town of Newhaven the remains of an ancient entrenchment are seen on the brow of Castle Hill. This earthwork, supposed to be Boman, was evi dently once of considerable extent, and of an oval form, but the greater part has been cut away by the sea. The cliffs, which are undermined here, are high ; more than 100 feet of chalk being"], [77, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 55 Yet the rivers aro filling their estuaries. covered by tertiary clay and sand from 60 to 70 feet in thickness. In a few centuries the last ves tiges of the plastic clay formation on the southern borders of the chalk of the South Downs on this coast will be annihilated, and future geologists will learn, from historical documents, the ancient geo graphical boundaries of this group of strata in that direction. On the opposite side of the estuary ofthe Ouse on the east of Newhaven har bour, a bed of shingle, composed of chalk flints, derived from the waste of the adjoining cliffs, had accumulated at Seaford for several centuries. In the great storm of November 1824, this bank was entirely swept away, and the town of Seaford inundated. Another great beach of shingle is now forming from fresh materials. 'The whole coast of Sussex has been inces santly encroached upon by the sea from time im memorial ; and although sudden inundations only, which overwhelmed fertile or inhabited tracts, are noticed in history, the records attest an extra ordinary amount of loss. During a period of no more than eighty years there are notices of about twenty inroads, in which tracts of land of from twenty to four hundred acres in extent were over whelmed at once.' With this devastation going on in these days, one would suppose that if in former days the sea"], [78, "56 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Cn. III. made the valleys of the Ouse and the many other rivers in its neighbourhood, if it did not continue to erode and enlarge these valleys, it would at least keep them open. But the sea erodes the outside of the land, not the inside of it. Instead of eroding the inside, the sea, which is devouring the outside of the land, has allowed the rivers to dam it out of the inside of it, to fill up arms of the sea. And with what materials have the rivers filled these arms of the sea, since they have not ' produced the openings,' and are not ' deepening the hollows which they traverse ? ' But parvis componere magna : let us ask this question on a larger scale. If the sea made the valleys of the Bhone, Bo, Mississippi, Ganges, and Niger, why does it yield to these rivers now, and allow them to protrude deltas of thousands and thousands of square miles ? One answer replies to both questions. Though the Ouse must cease to deepen its channel where it is level with the sea, at this present time there is not a heavy rain falls on the upper valley of the Ouse, but it deepens, lengthens, and widens that valley. And this is the case, not only with that valley and the valleys which I have enumerated, but with every valley in the wide wide world. And hence the materials which fill arms of the sea, and form alluvial plains and"], [79, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 57 deltas, unless the land is rising, or alongshore cur rents aud tides interfere by sea, or lakes catch the alluvium by land. The gradient of a valley is never permanent in any part. Every valley is always lengthening at the upper end or decreasing in height there ; and all intermediate parts are perpetually in process of being planed down, or built up to one uniform gradient from the head of the valley to its mouth, or to the end of the delta, if there be one. The gradient of a valley is never perma nent in any part. Valleys are always increasing, hills always decreasing. Indeed, valleys exist only in the dissolution of hills. But sedimentary strata are not formed only from the contents of valleys. The entire surface of the solid part of the globe, the earth, is always being washed by rain into the liquid part of the globe, the sea. We are not to imagine that it is in the Weald only that rivers run through ridges of hills. A glance at a physical map of England or the World, will show plenty of examples. Is Mr. Hopkins going to account for these ' cross fractures ' by ' mathematical methods ? ' How rivers run through ridges of hills even without ponding, as in the Weald. A stream running through ridges, large or small, is the simple consequence of the differing hardness of the ground through which it runs. In all cases a stream cuts for itself a narrow channel, the depth of which is determined by"], [80, "58 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. III. the hardest part. For a stream cannot run down where its bed is soft, and up again where it is hard. But the wash of rain digs down where the ground is soft, and leaves hills or ridges where it is hard. And as a stream cuts through a hard stratum, say the North or South Downs, the wash of rain is scooping out two lateral valleys behind it, that is, a valley behind each side of the gorge and ridge, as in the Weald clay. Such are the valleys along which the western branches of the Arun and Wey flow. Such are the valleys of the greensand and gault and the flats of the Weald clay behind the gorges of the South Downs in Sussex, and of the North Downs in Surrey and Kent. But in this small map only large streams are marked. The debris of these valleys is carried off by the lowering bed of the river. A ridge is then developed, and the river runs through a gorge in the ridge. In this sense the wash of rain may be said to form hills as well as valleys, since by abstracting inter vening masses it developes them, as, by abstract ing intervening Weald clay the wash of rain has cut the one original ridge or hill into three mam ridges, namely, the two chalk ridges and the Forest ridge. And in forming a statue what does the sculptor do more ? The ridges then, instead"], [81, "Ch. HI.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 59 of being considered as barriers to the river, have been actually formed by the river by the abstrac tion of intervening masses. The gorges, cut through comparatively hard beds or ridges, form exceptions to the widening of valleys as they descend. That is directly as the hardness of the beds through which the same valley runs will be the narrowness of that valley. Directly as the softness, the width. Above each hard gorge will invariably be a comparatively wide horizontal valley filled with an alluvial flat caused by the check of the flood water at the gorge. As the gorge is cut lower the alluvial flat will be cut through, and will vanish in the form of two parallel terraces. Another alluvial flat will be formed at a lower level, that also hereafter to vanish as parallel terraces, and as has been said (p. 19) these exceptions prove the rule that valleys are made by water and not by fire. For where valleys run across strata of dif ferent hardness, if the valleys were igneous cracks they would not vary in width or even in height of their sides according to the softness or hardness of the strata. The sides of the valleys across the Weald clay should be as high as in the gorges across the cha Ik if the valleys were igneous cracks. The great height of some of these ridges,"], [82, "60 DENUDATION OF WEALD RUNS [Ch. II f. The ' Weald valley' may become ' the oolitic valley, though a proof, is a very inadequate measure of the enormous denudation which has gone on be hind them, since the ridges themselves have suf fered enormous denudation.* The tops of all such ridges must originally have been lower than the hills from which the rivers rise. But whether all or any of them continue lower, and their com parative height one with the other, will depend simply on which is the hardest, that is, which is most quickly disintegrated and denuded ; the hills from which the rivers rise might be denuded as low as the beds of the rivers in the gorges. Suppose this to happen in the Weald. The Forest Ridge of Hastings sand might then become a marsh, on an oolitic bed ; and ' the Weald valley,' ' the oolitic valley.' It is not likely that it would then feed more than one outlet ; but if it still retained its present ten outlets (for I con sider the eastern Bother as one), I will make this possible valley with ten outlets a present to those who object to my definition of a valley. * As I published in the Athen\u00e6um in 1863, ' The power of denudation is by no means appreciated. All geologists follow Lyell in his dictum that denudation and deposit are equal and are the measure one of the other. Indeed Darwin calls this a profound remark. But it is a profound mistake ; it would only be true if deposits were never denuded. , But denudation is almost always employed on deposits, and past denudation ex ceeds existing deposits by an infinite multiple.'"], [83, ""], [84, "-Lonijmaji?

These causes produce a comparatively uniform slope of the bed of a river to the sea, with every species of irregularity of its banks, and the region through which it flows. This is the very fact which proves the aqueous origin of the river beds and valleys, as has been finely remarked by Blay fair on Hutton. It is impossible that earthquakes should have formed these continuous slopes to the sea through every different height of banks \u2014 this wonderful regularity passing through this wonder ful irregularity. Mantell tells us that at Hastings ' a diluvial valley intervenes between the white rock and the west cliff, where the ruins of the castle are situ ated.' Diluvial ! Beautiful ! A valley made by Noah's flood doubtless ! At least it cannot be an igneous crack here because this longitudinal or axial crack happens to run at right angles to all the transverse cracks of the Weald which are mathematically demonstrated by Mr. Hopkins to be igneous. In the next page Mantell says, ' Bursuing our course eastward, another deep valley occurs, through which is the romantic entrance to Hastings by the London road.' But he fails to tell us whether this ' deep valley ' is an igneous or an aqueous crack.

It is impossible that Mantell should have perceived that his valley at Hastings was diluvial without also perceiving that the entire valley of the Bother, from Crowborough to Bye is also diluvial and that this valley, now to so great an extent allu vial flats, is washed by rain out of what was originally the very highest part of the Weald hill. Why then is he silent on the subject ? And why are all the writers on the denudation of the Weald silent on the existence of the Bother and of its delta, Bomney Marsh ? Why, unless it be that the existence of these totally contradicts and overthrows their igneous crack theory ? With regard to the early history of this delta of the Bother, Holinshed talks of ' Bomneie Marsh, which in old time was called Bomania or Boman orum Lisula.' Mr. Holloway says that Bomney is the Saxon translation of this \u2014 ea being island. Dugdale referring to its embankment says, ' That it was therefore a work of the Bomans, whilst they were masters here, as it is the opinion of some learned men, so do I thereof make no doubt ; ' and he quotes Tacitus ' that the Britons complained that the Bomans wore out and consumed their bodies and hands in sylvis et paludibus emunien dis.' Dugdale says that Bomney Marsh was"], [87, "Ch.

In the Saxon times the grants of marsh land to the Church are of constant occurrence. Mr. Hol loway gives one of the earliest, a.d. 774. 'In nomine Jesu, Salvatoris mundi &c.

But it alludes to the ancient laws and customs of Bomney Marsh thereanent ; and indeed it seems founded entirely on these ' antiquas et approbatas consuetudines.' To come to modern times and to physical causes, the natives of this delta to a man will tell you that the land was ' left by the sea,' and they talk of the sea receding. But if the sea receded here it would recede at Folkestone, Hastings, and Beachy Head, where on the contrary it ad vances on the land. But if ' left by the sea ' means washed up by the sea, nothing can be more clear than the distinction between what is washed up by the sea and what is washed down by the river. What the sea casts up here is simply shingle and sand, worth perhaps three farthings a year rent as pasture, and as for ploughing it no one but Ulysses would attempt it."], [89, "Ch. III.] THROUGH RIDGES WITHOUT PONDING. 65 Embankment of new land still goes on. But in the delta and the alluvial plain together there are 62,449 acres embanked and drained, which perhaps average above three pounds an acre rent. Now the whole of this land has been brought down by rain and the river. Man has held more or less of these acres for the last 2000 years. When nature held this farm direct under the Almighty, I imagine that the river had three outlets, as is usual in deltas ; a main central trunk from Craven Bridge to Bomney, and two side outlets, one towards Hythe, and one towards Bye and Winchelsea. When the central Bomney river overflowed its even self-built banks, the heaviest materials held in suspension were soonest dropped, and the plain formed sloped from the central river to the two side outlets, where the floodwater, together with the adjacent streams escaped into the sea. Man, by embanking, has altered all this. There is now no longer any up ward growth of the plain, or as it is here called ' swarving up.' On the contrary, as the water is let off by sluices through the beach at low water, the plain is exposed to denudation, and may pro bably be considerably lower now than it was in the time of the Bomans. All that the river brings down is now forced directly into the sea.

Indeed it is not only that the emkank ment of.' derelict land,' as it is called, goes on to this day, but it may almost be called compulsory. For instance, the corporation of Bye embanked marshes in 1833, which they wished to preserve as reservoirs of tidal water to scour the mouth of the harbour. But these marshes ' swarved up ' so as only to be covered at the highest spring tides, and thus became useless as reservoirs for scouring. Here a present of land was forced on the corpora tion against its will by rain and rivers which from its nearness to the town is perhaps worth a rent of \u00a3h or \u00a36 per acre. About 1853, Lord H. Vane enclosed land on the great stone side of what was Bomney harbour, and the corporation of Bomney are in the act of enclosing now (written 1861) on the little stone side of this quod Cantianite dicitur ' swarved up ' harbour. Vast accumulations of sand are going on outside the mouth of the Bother. On this foundation the river will deposit the richest land, and Bye will be left inland as Newenden has been left inland.

When they walked their chalks, Crowborough beacon and the heights of the Forest Bidge were covered full fathom five, not only by kindred beds of their own long gone, such as the Horsted beds but by the depth of the Weald clay, the upper and lower greensands and the gault. When as exceptions (as at Barcombe) flints are found on the surface of the Weald, they are angular, which proves the atmospheric denudation of the Weald. If the denudation had been marine the flints should be rolled pebbles.

But no one can doubt that Hythe and Bomney, which are both inland now were once Cinque Borts ; and impossible as it may appear to some, it is equally certain that within historical times all the harbours of the alluvial Bother have been 'swarved up,' and now bear sheep instead of ships. Now 62,000 acres, worth perhaps \u00a3200,000 a year rent, are not formed by an igneous crack certainly. What did form them ? Bain and rivers, and rain and rivers in forming them sent a million times 62,000 acres into the sea, which is quite enough to account for alluvial valleys and a delta, where once stood the highest part of the anticlinal ridge of the Weald Hill. The alluvial plains of the Medway, and of the Great and Little Stour, have grown as rapidly as the delta of the Bother. And Bortus Butupiensis, like the harbours of the delta, bears sheep not ships, in the form of 25,000 acres of rich pasture. These dry acres are formed by deposit from water.

The fall of water and consequent denudation on the hill-top is, as they would say, arithmetical, there is no accumulation there. But the accumu lation and aggregation of water, and denudation is in a geometrical ratio as we proceed from the hill to the sea.

ORIGIN OF THE CHINES. ORIGIN OF THE NAME OF ' THE WEALD.' ANSWER TO LYELL'S QUESTION, ' AT WHAT PERIOD WAS THE WEALD VALLEY DENUDED ? ' The hill of the Weald and the valley of the St. Lawrence seem to have as little to do with each other theoretically, as practically they are far apart. Yet as each illustrates one of two modes in which nature drives her rivers across and through ridges of hills, I shall consider the two as one subject in two chapters. Lyell writes of the valleys of the Weald hill: ' If these transverse hollows could be filled up, all the rivers,' observes Mr. Conybeare, 'would be forced to take an easterly course, and to empty themselves into the sea by Bomney Marsh and Bevensea Levels.' To this we may add that then,"], [96, "72 THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUN [Ch. IV. and in that case, the Weald would be a valley with one lower outlet ; and if we prolong our ifs, we may also prolong our valley. For if the English Channel were filled up, and if the North and South Downs ran across it, and joined the chalk borders of the Seine, the waters of the Weald would help the Seine to drown Faris. And if Hampshire and the banks were high enough, and ' all the transverse hollows in France could be filled up,' the rain which falls on Nore Hill would run through the railroad tunnel above Dijon, and so by the Saone and Bhone to the Mediterranean. But ti si oupocvog sju.7r_.-01 ; this if appears to me inexpressibly childish, as also does one of Lyell's own ifs ('Brinciples'). If the high ground between the heads of Lake Superior and of the valley of the Mississippi were to sink ' by a series of successive subsidences,' the lake would be emptied into the Gulf of Mexico instead of the North Atlantic. ' If the event happened in a dry season, when the ordi nary channels of the Mississippi and its tributaries are in a great degree empty, the inundation might not be considerable ; but if in the flood season, a region capable of supporting a population of many millions might be suddenly submerged.' But Lyell forgets that the lake is filled by the rain and rivers of the high land, and that as the high land"], [97, "Ch. IV.] THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING. 73 Rivers may run over and through ridges of hills by ponding, as in the valley of the St. Lawrence sank ' by a series of successive subsidencies,' the lake would gradually become a dry valley. But now, after having abused the ifs of others, I will have an if of my own, or rather in conjunction with Lyell. He himself shows us that this lake, and all the American lakes are at this instant quietly in process of becoming dry valleys, without any violence, or any catastrophe, or any cataclysm ; that's the word, because people would understand you if you used the word flood. In direct contra diction to his own theory that all valleys are formed by submarine denudation, he says (' Brin ciples '), ' The falls of Niagara afford a magnifi cent example of the progressive excavation of a deep valley in a solid rock.' The cataract is now 165 feet in height. ' When it began to recede, it must have had nearly twice its present height.' Say 300 feet. Lyell thinks that the river forms this gorge at the rate of one foot in a year, and would therefore have taken 35,000 years to form the present seven miles. Mr. Bakewell allows a yard a year, redu cing the period to below 12,000 years. There are yet fifteen miles of gorge to make before the river begins to let off Lake Erie. Now here is a grand if. If, 50,000 years after this (don't laugh, there have been 50,000 50,000 years before this), Lyell, Martin, Hopkins, and"], [98, "74 THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUN [Ch. IV. Humboldt were to man a four-oar up the St. Lawrence, through this valley into the valleys which were the American lakes, how the whole crew would pride themselves on their ' cross fractures,' and ' rectangular intersections of s*eodesic lines ! ' As Lake Superior would have been the main recipient of alluvium, they might perhaps find little to indicate that the lower valleys had ever been lakes. ' And how on earth,' says Mr. Hopkins, ' is Colonel Greenwood going to make this placid stream cut a channel through yonder limestone mountain ridge thirty miles in length ? ' Here Lyell, looking serious, says, ' To tell you the truth, gentlemen, 50,000 years ago I foretold in the seventh edition of my \" Brinciples,\" page 202, that the river would do this.' ' Well,' says Mr. Hopkins, ' its raather late to contradict this now, but you must, because in your \" Elements \" you stood by me and my mathematical earthquakes in the Weald. And in the very \" Brinciples \" which you quote, you have ventured on mathematical earthquakes of your own, in Italy. Bage 246 you have formed the course of the Anio on my igneo mathematical plan.' ' The Anio flows through a deep irregular fissure or gorge in the Apennine limestone"], [99, "Ch. IV.] THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING. 75 Lyell contra dicts himself on this sub ject. which may have been caused by earthquakes. In this deep narrow channel there existed many small lakes, three of which have been destroyed since the time of history, by the erosive action of the torrent, the last of them having remained down to the sixth century of our era.' And indeed it is hard to see, if the ' fissure or gorge ' of the Niagara is of aqueous formation, why the ' fissure or gorge ' of the Anio should be of igneous formation. For in both cases there is the same cause, a river, working on the same material, limestone, producing the same effect, levelling the dams of lakes. ' I shall not deny what I have printed,' said Lyell, ' nor can you ; and you will allow, that, however often I have taken one side of this question, I have equally often taken the other. For instance, page 255 ; \" If we ascend, for example, the valley through which the Dranse flows, we find that it consists of a succession of basins, one above the other ; in each there is a wide expanse of flat alluvial lands, separated from the next basin by a rocky gorge, once evidently the barrier of a lake. The river has filled those lakes one after the other, and has partially cut through the barriers, which it is still gradually eroding to a greater depth. The examination of almost all valleys in mountainous"], [100, "76 THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUI\\ [Ch. IV. i districts affords similar proof of the obliteration of a series of lakes by the filling, up of hollows, and the cutting through of rocky barriers, a process by which running water ever labours to produce a more uniform declivity.\" 'There!' said Lyell, ' I am right either way ; for my sword cuts both ways.' In Mr. Hopkins's quick reply, the words were heard, ' better a sword should cut only the right way.' But Mr. Martin and Hum boldt interposing, adjourned the debate to that day 50,000 years. I have said that the denudation of the Weald and that of the valley of the St. Lawrence each illustrates one of two opposite ways in which nature works the same effect, namely, the driving rivers through ridges which cross their courses. It must be confessed, however, that to level and perfect the waterslope of the line of American lakes is a more difficult job than to make that of the Weald. For in the Weald the water has always worked from above, on soft materials, and with any number of streams, while the St. Lawrence has had, single-handed, an up-hill work, through the very hardest materials. It has had to fill the lakes before it could erode the lowest part of their brims. But though water cannot flow up hill, it can by ponding flow over hills, and so cut channels"], [101, "Ch. IV.] THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING 77 The American lakes are being laid dry by rain. through hills, and this, as Lyell says, is a very universal process in nature. This universal process is, however, directly opposed to the submarine theory. Truth, if not always, is at least often para doxical, and paradoxical as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that rain and rivers are laying dry these, the largest bodies of fresh water in the world. And that by a double process also paradoxical. First, by filling them with allu vium. Second, by emptying them by eroding their barriers. With regard to the first cause, the filling them in, Lyell says, ' the streams which discharge their waters into Lake Superior are several hundred in number, without reckoning those of smaller size. On the northern side, which is encircled by primary mountains, the rivers sAveep in many large boulders with smaller gravel and sand, chiefly composed of granite and trap rocks.' The more central deposits consist of ' finer mud ' and ' adhesive clay.' With regard to the second cause, the emptying of the lakes by the erosion of their barriers, that this is going on, is proved by parallel terraces, marking their former levels far above their present levels. A depth of fifty feet has been thus taken from the surface of Lake Superior, which is nearly 2,000 miles in"], [102, "78 THE ST. LAWRENCE WILL RUN [Ch. IV. This will happen with out any apparint change. circumference. This again, like the parallel roads of Glen Boy, is an example of lateral denudation which may be seen. Yet this great actual change has been worked without any apparent change. That is, this vast bulk of water has passed through the single outlet at St. Mary's without causing the smallest symptom of flood at any former time, any more than the same process does at this instant. For the increase of the outflow is graduated by the decrease of the barrier, the gradualness of which we cannot even form a notion of. Indeed, the actual course of much more sudden changes than this is quite imperceptible to us. If a man never has an illness from eight years old to eighty, he suffers much alteration in the time ; yet at no one instant is he aware of the change which is continuously taking place in his organisation. With regard to the inorganic world, eternal gradual change is to finite beings like man, the same as no change at all. So that when, for beneficent purposes, instead of eighty years, God ordains that geological causes should take 80,000 years to work their effects, man disbelieves that any change is occurring, or that any change can occur from such insignificant causes. The lake however, will become dry land by the meeting of two opposite effects of the same, so thought"], [103, "Ch. IV. I THROUGH RIDGES BY PONDING. 79 insignificant, cause \u2014 rain. That is, by the raising of the bottom and the sinking of the top of its waters. Man will then gain a fertile tract, whose area is nearly equal to that of England. And be the transmutation of water into land ever so quick, or ever so slow, no ' boundary question ' can arise. During the operation and for ever, water will always separate Canada from America, John from Jonathan ; may we not rather say that water will always unite them. But this gift will be as subject to change as are all those which we receive from our Al mighty Creator, The erosion of the barrier at St. Mary's will still continue.

Suppose the land to have risen 100 feet above the level of the sea. This would have given a constant rapid fall from the river's mouth to the sea, and the river would thus gain the power of lowering its bed. While this was going on, no delta could be formed. And where rivers have estuaries instead of deltas, it may possibly in some cases, be owing as much to the rise of land as to the wash of marine currents. In the case of the St. Lawrence, for instance, if a delta had been in formation before the land rose, as it rose the river must have cut a channel through the delta to the depth of 100 feet. There are two miniature Weald valleys in the Isle of Wight, which, like every other spot on earth, witness to the transition of the earth into the sea. The north chalk, from the Needles to Culver Cliffs, is equivalent to the North Downs. The south chalk, St. Catherine's Hill, is equiva lent to the South Downs.

This is the origin of the Chines ; and if any one wants to see nature beginning new val leys, these chines are very pretty examples of the operation. I think that the name is provincial for chin. Near Newhaven is a Chin Gap, of pre cisely the proper shape for the name. The wash of rain from the north of the south chalk formed the eastern part of the bed of drift which overlies the Wealden from Atherfleld to Brixton (Bridestone) Bay ; as the southern run of the north chalk has formed the western part of this bed, from Compton Bay to Brook Bay. In all the geological sections and accounts of this district that I have seen, the north chalk is designated as vertical, the south chalk as hori zontal. This is a great mistake. Equivalent parts of each have the same degree of dip ; though the dip of the north chalk is to the north west, and the dip of the south chalk to the south east. On the top of the north range the chalk is nearly horizontal ; but as we descend to the north side and foot of the hill, the beds are vertical. On the top of the south range, the chalk has a gentle dip to the south-east ; and but that the chalk which formerly clothed the south side and foot of this range has long been washed into the sea, the beds of it would have been vertical, as a matter of course ; so would any G"], [106, "THE ST.

If these beds were not vertical, we must suppose that the elevation of the anticlinal axis of the Wealden produced one mechanical effect on the north side and a contrary mechanical effect on the south side, which is absurd. We can see that the south-east dip of the lower cretaceous beds from Atherfield to beyond Bocken End, is equivalent to the north-west dip of. these beds from Compton Grange towards Freshwater. If the upper bed of chalk did not dip also, we must suppose that it was deposited unconformably on the lower cretaceous beds, which is also absurd. The name of ' the Weald ' is from Andreades weald ; the Saxon translation of the Boman Silva Anderida. Whether Bevensey in Sussex or New enden in Kent was Anderida is now disputed. Andred was the ancient British for uninhabited. I persuade myself that the traces of this ancient Forest may still be seen as far west as Botherfield in Hampshire, in the magnificent old pollards (polled) there, and in the black rings of the charcoal burner. He was obliged to poll the trees to grow his coppice wood in the air, on account of the browsing of the deer and cattle.

' the answer is, the period extends from the first moment that the tertiary strata were rained on to the present moment, and the period will be extended till the last grain of the Wealden region is deposited below the wave ; nay, though it is a bull, till long after this ; for when the Wealden strata are gone, the region will become an oolitic region ; which, like all other regions, will be finally put under the sea.

ETERNAL CIRCLE OF CHANGES. In chapter xlv., ' Brinciples,' Lyell makes up by far his best mixture of his various theories for the formation of valleys, since he there confines himself to rain and rivers. And with the excep tion that he lays too much stress on the erosion of their banks by rivers, with some trifling contra dictions, the principles are here true principles. He talks of 'those disintegrated rocks, of which such enormous masses are swept down annually into the sea.' And he winds up with, ' by plough ing up thousands of square miles, and exposing a surface for part of the year to the action of the elements, we assist the abrading force of rain, and dimmish the conservative effects of vegetation.'"], [110, "[Ch. V. 86 LYELL ON THE This is all right. This is subaerial denudation, and very contrary to the submarine theory. Bage 685, he enquires how far vegetation may 'retard the levelling effects of running water, which it cannot oppose, much less counter balance. It is well known that a covering of herbage and shrubs may protect a loose soil from being carried away by rain, or even by the ordinary action of a river, and may prevent hills of loose sand from being blown away by wind ; for the roots bind together the separate particles into a firm mass, and the leaves intercept the rain water, so that it dries up gradually, instead of flowing off in a mass, and with great velocity. The old Italian hydrographers make frequent mention of the increased degradation which has followed the clearing away of natural woods in several parts of Italy. A remarkable example was afforded in the Upper Val D'Arno in Tuscany, on the removal of the woods clothing the steep declivities of the hills by which that valley is bounded. When the ancient forest laws were abolished by the Grand Duke Joseph, during the last century, a considerable tract of surface in the Cassentina (the Clausentinium of the Bomans) was denuded, and immediately the quantity of sand and soil washed down into the Anio increased enormously. Frisi, alluding to such"], [111, "Ch. V.] VAL D'ARNO. 87 occurrences, observes, that as soon as the bushes and plants were removed the waters flowed off more rapidly, and, in the manner of floods, swept away the vegetable soil. This effect of vegetation is of high interest to the geologist, when he is considering the formation of those valleys which have been principally due to the action of rivers. The spaces intervening between valleys, whether they are flat or ridgy, when covered with vege tation, may scarcely undergo the slightest waste, as the surface may be protected by the green sward of grass ; and this may be renewed, in the manner before described, from elements derived from rain-water and the atmosphere. Hence, while the river is continually bearing down matter in the alluvial plain and undermining the cliffs on each side of every valley, the height of the intervening rising grounds may remain stationary.' Observe the change of agents in forming valleys, in one short sentence. It begins with rain from above, and ends with the river ' under mining the cliffs ' from below ; though it is evident, that if valleys were formed by the undermining erosion of rivers, even in unrocky ground like our chalk, the sides would be pre cipitous \"cliffs,' and the tops of intervening hills flat table land ; while the enlargement of If valleys were widened by erosion of river banks, their sides would not slope, but must be cliffs with interven ing table land."], [112, "88 [Ch. V. LYELL ON THE Rivers may cut deep channels, rain makes wide valleys. such valleys could only take place by a constant calamitous succession of land-slips, in the same way that cliffs yield to the erosion of the sea. Bivers have the power to cut narrow channels or ravines; but they have very little power of widening these. Disintegration and the wash of rain widen these ravines into broad valleys. While this is going on rivers convey to the sea what rain brings to them, which would other wise pass out of the valleys more slowly by the wash of rain. But rivers no more make the sediment which they carry than railroads manufacture the wares of which their traffic consists. The sediment carried by rivers is brought to them by rain, from the entire surface of their tributary ground, or waterslope. Erosion of banks is an excep tional calamity. But heavy rain never happens, but it loads the rivers with mud. Nay, it loads the along-shore waters of the sea with mud. These are matters of fact, not matters of opinion. We ' need no ghost ' nor good eyes to ascertain them ; all we need good is the umbrella and macintosh, to enable us to go out and see.

The peculiarities of the physiognomy of the district were at once explained ; and I was taught that on speculating on the greater effects which the direct action of rain may once have produced on the surface of certain parts of England, we need not revert to periods when the heat of the climate was tropical.' But why the words ' greater ' and ' once T Why, if ram once denuded the surface in England, should it have ceased to do so now ? Did it rain harder once ? Or is the ground harder now ?

But I must say a word theoretically to those who may not have met with Lyell's practical proof. Most people are doggedly possessed of the idea that water will not flow on land which has no slope. But as rain falls from high Heaven, its only relief from rising on itself is to flow. Empty a decanter of water on the middle of the table. Does the water remain in the middle ? Introduce a pipe of running water to the middle of a flat stone hall. The water flows all over the flat pavement, and finally escapes from the hall by every door. Why ? Not because it ilows without a fall, but because it rises on itself, and so makes a fall. unda impellitur unda Urgeturque prior venienti urgetque priorem. As the tide flows up the bed of every river twice every day, perhaps for the space of 100 miles, at the rate of twenty miles an hour, stop the pipe of supply and the hall will ' run dry ; ' continue the supply for ever, and a channel would be worn at each door, and from any two doors across the centre of the hall we should have one of Humboldt's 'great fissures,' or Messrs. Martin's and Hopkins's 'cross fractures.' Nature drains and denudes every flat on earth on this principle, a channel being cut backward"], [115, "Ch.

We need no Jupiter Tonans, nor need we go to Spain to see that flat land is denuded by rain. There is a clay field near this house, so flat that no eye could fortell which way the water would run off it. Yet every heavy rain it discolours the whole of the stable pond with a copious yellow stream, through an exit in the bank. No one can doubt in this case that rain denudes the flat field and deposits in the pond.* I have seen this hap pen when the field was covered with an excellent crop of clover two years old. So that the strong soil was not only ' matted together ' by roots, but the rain was ' broken in its fall ' by the leaves and stalks, which really were close enough to the ground to effect this, operations which Lyell alludes to thus in finishing the page : ' In the Torrid Zone the degradation of land is generally more rapid, but the waste is by no means propor tioned to the superior quantity of rain, or the sud denness of its fall, the transporting power of water * Possibly one of the benefits of underdraining is that, besides letting off water which would stagnate, in the opera tion, the finer parts of soil are washed in instead of out.

A geologist who is no stranger to tropical countries, observes, that the softer rocks would speedily be washed away in such regions if the numerous roots of plants were not matted together in such a manner as to produce consider able resistance to the destructive power of the rains. The parasitical and creeping plants also entwine in every possible direction, so as to render the forests nearly impervious, and the trees pos sess forms and leaves best calculated to shoot off the heavy rains, which, when they have been broken in their fall, are quickly absorbed by the ground beneath, or when thrown into the drain age depressions, give rise to furious torrents.' These are curious functions of the leaves. They first cause the rain to be ' quickly absorbed,' and then ' give rise to furious torrents.' But we may pass over small tributary contradictions when we are considering the four main channels of contra diction by which Lyell forms valleys. And what a delightful change from the ' great fissure ' sys tem ! At this moment all theories are left in the lurch, except disintegration and the wash of rain, and the question is how to prevent the whole sur face soil being bodily washed away by rain, and this in England, Italy, Spain and the tropics.

With regard to the denudation of such ' steep declivities ' as those of the Val D'Arno, nature endeavours to preserve the soil by the roots of woods, though Lyell has a hankering to make 'the leaves intercept the rain water, so that it dries up gradually, instead of flowing off in a mass and with great velocity,' and would persuade us that instead of the roots protecting the soil in tropical forests, ' the trees possess forms and leaves best calculated to shoot off the heavy rains, which, when they have been broken in their fall, are quickly ab sorbed by the ground beneath.' The fall of rain from leaves is the reverse of conservative to the soil. Leaves collect the rain into infinitely larger masses than the natural rain drop, and mechanically tear up the soil. If you wish to see this fact, examine a road under the head of a tree, you will find only rough stones, because the finer material has been mechanically ejected. If you wish to hear the fact, walk under a tree with an umbrella in heavy rain. The um brella will tell you as plain as it can speak of the increased size of the drops.

When art has thus done her best greenly to flounce nature's garment to the highest, we often see above, long and deep ridges of grey, bald rock without a shrub. Yet, by the chemical action of the atmosphere and by the chemical and mechanical action of rain, this region, the picture of sterility in itself, is a constant source of the most fertile soil for the terraces of the hill side below.

Four different theories for the formation of val- leys are not so many, but that Lyell must start a fifth for the formation of the great valley of Etna, the Val del Bove. He attributes its formation to subsidence. As he could not conveniently get the sea over Mount Etna, he forgets his submarine theory altogether, and simply fights against ' run- ning water.' 'Brinciples,' page 396., he says: 'We cannot ascribe this valley to the action of running water ; for if it had been excavated exclusively by that power, its depth would have increased in the descent ; whereas, on the contrary, the precipices are most lofty at the upper extremity, and di minish gradually on approaching the lower region of the volcano.'

Does not the height of these sides vary in every part, without any reference whatever to the bed of the valley ? The height of the sides of the valley, or their comparative height at different places, has nothing to do with the question. The question is, does the bed of the valley, independently of interrup tion from modern lava streams, slope continuously to the sea ? as it does so, there is every presump tion that this slope was graduated by water ; and it woidd have required a miracle to have subsided in this form ; consider the extent of the continuous descent of the Mississippi from the Bock}T Moun tains to the Gulf of Mexico, contrasted Avith the utter irregularity of the sides of the valley, and as Blayfair remarks, it is as infinity to unity, that water must have graduated the descent ; the irregularity of the sides of mountainous valleys, contrasted with the regularity of their beds, is the very fact which proves that valleys have been formed by the descent of water. For what other agent could have produced these marvellously regular slopes of boundless extent, in the midst of the most thoroughly irregular surfaces ? Besides this, if the Val del Bove had subsided, it would have subsided bodily. But there are certain rocks, Finocchio, Lepra, Capra, and Mu- H"], [122, "98 [Ch. VI. LYELL ON THE sara, which, owing to their hardness, have resisted disintegration and the wash of rain, and stand abruptly out of the bed of the valley. Of these rocks, Lyell, with much naivete remarks, ' Almost all the isolated masses in the Val del Bove, such as Capra, Musara, and others, are traversed by dikes, and may, perhaps, have partly owed their preservation to that circumstance, if at least the action of occasional floods has been one of the destroying causes in the Val del Bove ; for there is nothing which affords so much protection to a mass of strata against the undermining action of running rvater as a perpendicular dike of hard rock.' The precipitous sides of the valley are also scored throughout with an infinity of projecting dikes, or veins of injected lava. I call these as witnesses in my favour ; for I do not think that subsidence would have left these projections, but disintegration and wash of rain would. Lyell says of them : ' They consist of harder materials than the strata which they traverse, and therefore ivaste away less rapidly under the influence of that repeated congelation and thawing to which the rocks in this zone of Etna are exposed.' Now, though Lyell may not agree with me in thinking that these dikes prove the original form ation of the valley by ivaste, he here allows and shows that the prolongation and enlargement of"], [123, "Ch. VI.] VAL DEL BOVE. 99 the valley is at this instant going on by waste precisely the same as they do in every other valley in the world. But though these dikes are witnesses of the waste, they are by no means measures of it ; for they are not only equally exposed with their softer neighbours to disin tegrating causes, but, from their projection, they are infinitely more exposed to these disintegrating causes. The head of every valley on a steep hill side forms, and must form, ' an amphitheatre, sur rounded on three sides with ' banks, if not preci pices, ' the loftiest being at the upper end, and the height gradually diminishing on both sides.' Lyell says this of the Val del Bove, as if it was extraordinary, and peculiar to that valley. But if it were granted that this valley were formed by subsidence, is Lyell going to form all the other valleys of Etna by subsidence ? or, if not, how have they been formed, except by the wash of rain? since they have confessedly never been under the sea. Lyell, indeed, says ' that running water in gene ral exerts no power on Etna, the rain which falls being immediately imbibed by the porous lavas ; so that, vast as is the mountain, it feeds only a few small rivulets, and these even are dry throughout the greater portion of the year.

LYELL ON THE Why volcanic districts have weak springs and deep dry ravines. rounded boulders, therefore, of felspar, porphyry, and basalt, a line of which can be traced from the sea from near Giardini, by Mascali, and Zafarana to the Val del Bove, would offer a perplexing problem to the geologist, if history had not pre served the memorials of a tremendous flood, which happened in this district in the year 1755.' This was from snow melted by an eruption. But is it possible that Lyell can attribute the line of boulders to this one historical accident? In my opinion, the reason why volcanic districts have so few permanent springs, is the exact reverse of the reason given by Lyell. I think that the lava (I do not talk of cones of cinders) of these districts is generally so un porous, that all ram is instantly shot off in the form of surface flood water. Besides, I think that the sort of dome-like, pent-house form, in which the coatings of lava are successively laid over volcanic districts, has a tendency to shoot water off the surface, and prevent its soaking in. And hence the depth of the dry ravines, and the weakness of the springs. If ' the rain which falls were immediately absorbed by the porous lavas,' it would reappear in strong springs, streams, and rivers. But besides that in his account of the Val del Bove, we have just seen that Lyell refers to"], [125, "Ch. VI-] 101 VAL DEL BOVE. ' the action of the occasional floods ; ' a little after his first historical flood of 1755, he tells us of another historical flood in 1761. In this second historical flood, which arose from ' the fall of heavy rains, aided, probably, by the melting of snow,' ' sixty of the inhabitants of Acicatena were killed, and many of their houses swept away.' I wonder how many unhistorical floods pass down the valleys of Etna every year now, and how many millions have passed down them. I should guess that, while the snow is melting, streams must run from the head to the foot of Etna every year for perhaps a hundred successive days and nights. But, besides the effects of general aqueous causes, is Etna free from the effects of its own particular local watering pot? \u2014 from the lava d'acqua ? In describing Vesuvius, Lyell says, ' great floods of mud were as destructive as the lava itself \u2014 no uncommon occurrence during these catastrophes ; for such is the violence of rain produced by the evolutions of aqueous vapours, that torrents of water descend the cone (no porousness helps it here), and becoming charged with impalpable volcanic dust, and rolling along loose ashes, acquire sufficient consistency to deserve their ordinary appellation of ' aqueous lavas.'

Herculaneum is ' covered not only by showers of ashes, but by alluviums and streams of lava,' ' to a depth of nowhere less than 70, and in many places of 112 feet.' Lyell says of Torre del Greco : ' It seems pro bable that the destruction of three thousand of its inhabitants in 1631, which some accounts attribute to boiling water, was principally due to one of those alluvial floods which we before mentioned.'

If not, the great work of the next age will be an expurgated edition of Lyell. In his account of the formation of the valleys of Calabria, Lyell is as completely in contra diction as usual to his own submarine theory in particular, and to his four (or five) theories in general. Indeed, I think that he should here be credited with a sixth theory ; for he here joins"], [128, "104 LYELL ON THE [Ch. VII. Ly ell's sixth theory of the formation of valleys. fire and water in a most unholy alliance against the devoted region. And the mode of action of the allied forces is quite distinct from their mode of action in the Weald. Chapter xxix., 'Principles,' he considers ' how earthquakes contribute to the formation of valleys.' But his earthquakes in Calabria are no longer ' mathematical earth quakes' like those of the Weald. He does not crack out ' great fissures,' forming a ' rectan gular intersection of geodesic fines,' like Hum boldt, or fractures, 'longitudinal and transverse,' like Messrs. Martin and Hopkins. He makes his regular approaches, indeed ; but on a system quite different from that employed in the Weald. He saps with water, and then springs his sub terranean mine. With the Mediterranean on one side, and the Adriatic on the other, he surely throws away a chance for the employment of his own submarine plan. And with the crest of the Apennines between these two seas, what an inexhaustible field for fissures, cracks, and portages ! But, no ; earthquakes and the erosion theory become the sole and sovereign specific for valley-making here. When taken to be well shaken ; that is, when water has undermined the cliff from below, an earthquake is to shake it down from above. The plan would be no great improvement, how-"], [129, "Ch.

In 1783, 60,000 Calabrians fell wretched victims to one earthquake.* And if Brovidence were to be so improvident as to allow Lyell to carry out his plan as a system, the consequences would be as disastrous to the land as to its unfortunate inhabitants ; for instead of gently sloping hill and dale, we should have a chaos intersected by clefts inclosed by cliffs. Lyell says (p* 466), that ' the formation of valleys by running water can never be understood if we consider the question independently of the agency of earthquakes. It must not be imagined that rivers only begin to act when a country is already elevated far above the level of the sea ; for their action must of necessity be most power ful while land is rising or sinking by successive movements.' Again he talks of ' that peculiar removing force * The great igneous authority, Humboldt, repeats the ancient vulgar error, that volcanoes are ' safety-valves ' against earthquakes. The Calabrians, \u2014 oh fortunati nimium ! \u2014 are nearly surrounded by safety-valves \u2014 Vesuvius, Etna, Stromboli, and another in the Lipari Isles. Humboldt quotes Strabo for the fact that Sicily was much more shaken by earthquakes before it was divided from Italy ! and before Etna was a volcano ! The modern earthquake referred to above, disregarding these ancient facts, not only desolated Messina at the foot of Strabo's safety-valve, but destroyed the aged Prince of Scilla, with 1430 of his people, who had taken to their fishing-boats in the hope of safety ; and Humboldt says ' 60,000 were destroyed- in Sicily, in 1693,' in spite of their Etna, their Stromboli, and their separation from Italy."], [130, "106 [Ch.

The sides of the valley must be again cut away by the stream and made to form pre cipices and overhanging cliffs before the next shock can take effect. ' If a single convulsion of extreme violence should agitate at once an entire hydrographical basin, or if the shocks should follow each other too rapidly, the previously existing valleys would be annihilated instead of being modified and enlarged. Every stream might in that case be compelled to begin its operations anew, and to shape out new channels, instead of continuing to deepen and widen those already excavated.

Here, in direct contradiction to his own sub- marine system of forming valleys, Lyell accords that function to rivers. But it appears that the operation is much facilitated if from time to time the valleys are choked up by earthquakes ; or if the previously existing valleys shoidd be annihilated, and ' every stream be compelled to begin its operations anew, and to shape out new channels, instead of continuing to deepen and widen those already excavated.' Also that ' the action must of necessity be most powerful while the land is rising or sinking ; ' why, he neglects to inform us. Bivers can only cut valleys down to the level of the sea, and if the land is then raised the rivers may then deepen the valleys. This would give the rivers more to do, if that is to make them more ' powerful.' But how would a sinking make them more powerful ? With submission, neither Lyell nor earthquakes are likely to throw light on the subject ; and ' if we consider the question ' as dependent on ' the agency of earthquakes,' ' the formation of valleys by running water can never be under stood.' However, in the proper districts of earthquakes, in volcanic regions, Lyell is right"], [132, "108 LYELL ON THE [Ch. VII.

His own submarine theory will not apply to volcanic districts or islands, for their surfaces have been ejected over them when they were already above the sea ; and they have been coated and recoated thousands of times, by floods of melted rock when they had long been sub dio. Yet the gradients of the river valleys and dry valleys, and the whole form of the ridges and furrows of the entire surface drainage of a volcanic region (say Madeira), are so precisely the same as those of any other mountainous district, that no eye can glance over the two, and doubt for an instant that the same cause caused the form of the drainage of both. In Tenerife I have seen numberless cases of volcanic dikes which projected from the opposite sides of valleys, and ran across the streams in their beds at all angles ; and sometimes four or five dikes close to each other, and not parallel. The direction of the water- courses is never altered by these dikes, as is asserted by Keith Johnston. A dike simply retards the deepening of the ravine where the dike is, and that part of the ravine which is above it. The part below it will be deepened precisely as if the dike did not exist. But the part above must wait for the lowering of the dike, and the deepening will then"], [133, "Ch. VII.] VALLEYS OF CALABRIA. 109 go on backward ; that is, from the dike towards the hill. When a dike runs diagonally across the main ravine, it of course does the same with the minor ridges and furrows, with which rain has scored the entire surface of the sides of each ravine. These minor ravines, however, run ' right up and straight down,' regardless of the dike or Keith Johnston. This may be well seen from the acqueduct in the ravine north of Santa Cruz. We have only to look at a geological map, to see the incorrectness of Keith Johnston's remark, that rivers change the direction of their courses with every change of geological strata. These valleys of Tenerife are almost all dry, except in rain. The beds of the upper parts are sheer rock, the middle parts wear the 'appearance of torrents of stones, the lower beds are alluvial plains of stones, and opposite the mouths of these valleys are very commonly deltas and bars of stones. Behind these bars, after each rain, large deposits of earth and sand are formed, which the people diligently collect. Where permanent streams exist, they are usually lost at a consider able distance above the mouths of the valleys ; that is, except in rains, they percolate to the sea, beneath the alluvial plains, deltas, and bars. From the sides, hundreds or thousands of torrents of stones fall into these rivers of stones. Some-"], [134, "110 LYELL ON THE [Ch. VII.

In this case, I imagine that the overwhelming force of what the French call the debacle comes into play. I shall translate it by ' the flood of out burst.' This takes place usually on the breaking up of the ice in all northern rivers or of dams formed by avalanches; and in such cases credi dimus Jovem regnare. But without frost or snow, in all steep hollows and mountain torrents, the 'flood of outburst' is of constant occurrence. The paving blocks of the beds of torrents catch floating rubbish, large and small, and form tem porary dams and lakes. Away goes a block, which deepens the outlet some feet. Bock after rock follows, dashing itself and its neigh bours below into pieces a tenth part of their former size. A day or two after, we decide that the brawling streamlet, which seems to ask per mission to steal through these fragments, never did, nor ever will, have power to move one of them.

Can any one see the blue Atlantic at Funchal turned to blood-red by every rain, and not perceive that the beautiful island is gradually and annually melting into the sea ?

These islands exemplify the contrary effects of the contrary causes \u2014 fire and water, and vividly portray the perpetual contest between the two powers which Lyell has united. They show us that rain, which we consider only as a productive power, is the destroyer, the dissolver of con tinents ; and that subterranean igneous action, which we consider only as a destructive power, is the producer, the replacer of continents.

Indeed, take our six south coast counties, and I do not think that from a glance at the pebbles on the spot any one would at first say whether he was at Helston in Cornwall, at Slapton sands in Devonshire, at the Chesil beach in Dorset shire, at Hurst Castle in Hampshire, at St. Leonard's, in Sussex, or at Dover or Dengeness in Kent. On observing what are called groins the whole affair appeared clear. Where the land is low or the cliffs are of soft material it is common to protect them by groins, that is, lines of posts boarded running straight across the beach and decreasing in height from the land to the sea. These groins do not protect the land immediately but through the medium of the beaches. That is, they prevent its travelling, and it is very curious to observe how very light a breeze, if it is along shore or oblique to it (even off shore) will cause the wave to break obliquely to the shore, and I 2"], [140, "116 TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. [Ch. VIII. consequently will heap the beach down wind against the groin. When the wave falls parallel to the shore it forms the lower shore in ridge and furrow running; straight across the shore to the sea. But as the wind blows the wave flows and as the wave flows the beach goes, and in general the wave breaks on the shore obliquely. But it always recedes from the shore straight, conse quently every pebble that is moved travels along the shore with the wind or at least with the wave. On all large beaches of shingle two or three terraces may in general be seen, owing to the movement of beach at the different high water marks at spring and neap tides, and also to the accidental differing height and power of the waves at high water, and on the same groin these ter races may often be seen to have been heaped while travelling in opposite directions, according as opposite winds have prevailed. It requires an oblique gale of wind at high water at the highest spring tide to smooth the entire beach. Groins are generally tied by cross beams from the side of the greatest exposure to wind. These beams become permanently imbedded and hold the groins by tension. So that the greater the weight on the groin the greater the power which holds its ties, and the weight against the groin is thus most ingeniously made to hold itself up."], [141, "Cu. VIII.] TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. 117 Sorting and sizing of sea beach. When the pebbles have risen as high as the groins they flow over the groins. But they never heap on the leeward side. On the contrary, the sea always digs deepest on the leeward side of the groins. For the oblique wave flows freely up the heaped windward side and over the groin and falls with impact on the unheaped leeward side and would undermine props of the groin. Thus the beach on the leeward side of a groin recedes from the sea by denudation, and the beach on the windward side of a groin advances into the sea by heaping, and the oblique wave is constantly at work to bring the line of beach parallel to itself. Shake the sugar-basin. The large lumps come to the top ; the fine sugar goes to the bottom : because the small grains have a greater facility in passing downward between the large lumps than the large lumps have. From the sugar-basin reason, when the field has been well worked and harrowed, all the surface flints are above the sur face. Abstract the motion and they have a ten dency to sink, I think as low as the bottom of the soil. From this sugar-basin reason, as the largest pebbles are always on the surface of the beach, they are the first to be struck by the wave, and they are rolled to the top of the beach, and this sugar-basin reason sifts, sorts, and sizes the beach on every seashore of the wide, wide world.

On the shore it is the upward stroke of the wave which places the largest pebbles on the upper part of the surface, and as extremes meet, the lightest floatage and the heaviest drift travel together up the shore in each flood tide, and are left together in a line to mark how far it ranged. But the largest pebbles on the surface of the shore are not only exposed to the upward stroke of the wave. They are also exposed to the on ward stroke of the oblique wave. The largest pebbles travel most quickly to leeward, and between all groins this diminishing of the pebbles from the leeward groin to the windward groin may be seen. Now, as the oblique wave travels along shore, but returns straight, there must be a constant passage of water along shore to leeward. This must be compensated by an under current in the sea, and though this under current would not carry shingle, it would carry those finest particles of sand which may be * held in suspension, and I think that this is the cause of the accumulation of sand fine enough to blow which is so common at the windward end of large beaches, and which may be observed at Bridport (Bride-port), the windward end of the Chesil beach, notwithstand-"], [143, ""], [144, "\"\"\"\" \u25a0\"\"\"^^^\u25a0~~\"~^~^~^^~'~\u2014 ~ Edw^WeUer Landau . lontfmaii _\u25a0 Co ."], [145, "Cu.

But besides these normal movements some seas carry beach out for other seas to bring in again. Thus I was told by fishermen at Abbotsbury that their crab-pots were sometimes filled or buried by shingle at a considerable distance at sea, and at Slapton sands that smugglers dared not sink their tubs there for fear of losing them in that way. It is probably in this way that shingle passes round headlands, and quantities of beach are carried out too far to be washed in again. This is the origin of the rounded pebble, the travelled pebble, the sand and the Druid-sandstone in our ' plastic clay and sand.' Now, I think that the law of the sugar-basin and the laws of the groin apply universally to all beaches and that the peninsula of Giens and the peninsula of Bortland may be viewed as natural groins. At St. Salvadour on the coast of France, opposite to Giens, I found what I conceive to be a raised beach. Baised beaches exist along our south coast, and I think that it is the shallows caused by the rising of the land which has allowed the accumulation of double beaches between Giens and the land as well as between Bortland and the land (Chesil beach and Smallmouth sands)."], [146, "120 [Ch. VIII. TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. Dover built on a beach 2,000 years old. Bebbles never accumulate where the water is deep and the cliff steep, not because they cannot travel there, but because they cannot stop there. A boulder lifted there travels with the wave almost as freely as the water which composes the wave. Boulders can no more accumulate where the water is deep and the cliff steep than soil can accumulate on the face of a precipice though the soil is perpetually forming there from disintegra tion. It is the friction of a sloping shore and the constant tendency to be landed high and dry which stops the boulder on his journey, and they only stop when they have got out of the way of the sea. They cannot rest within reach of the waves. A storm at a high spring tide may put them out of route for years, centuries, nay, thousands of years, and again set them at liberty. Speaking liberally, we know that part of the beach at Dover has been stationary for 2,000 years ; since Lyon (page 119, vol. i.) says ' the Bomans erected some of their first buildings upon it at this place and a part of the ruins have re mained to our time,' and these banks must not only have been formed, but must have assumed a permanent character before they were built on by the Bomans. From these times to the present day, and especially from the times of Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Henry VII.,"], [147, "Ch.

The engineer's art, however, has not been called on to prevent ocean from destroying its apparently most ephemeral land together with the town on it, but to prevent ocean from consolidating its work to such a degree as to stop up the harbour. Lyons says (page 146) ' the houses at the foot of the high and almost perpendicular cliff, are con- sidered by strangers in a perilous situation ; but use has familiarised it to the inhabitants, and experience has taught them that there is not much danger to be apprehended by the falling of the chalk above them.' This fact is quite in accordance with the theories which I fight for. The sea undermining the foot of a cliff keeps it a precipice and induces heavy falls. Bemove the action of the sea and atmosphere disintegration and denudation work most mildly in softening down the precipice, and the accumulation from its gradual decay is easily prevented. But for this it would long ago have formed a smooth slope of grass. But in parts now the foot both of the east cliff and west cliff is terraced and cut into some what smoky hanging gardens.

The ruins of the head land, however, furnish a constant supply of land boulders for the bay on each side, which accumu late there as soil accumulates in the valley. If in the centre of the bay rain and rivers have denuded the land to the sea level, the sea cannot farther erode it except by first shovelling the whole beach on to the land and then eroding the ground on which the beach stood. Thus the hard head land while it faces the attack of the eternal eroder at the same time throws a shield of boulders be fore its softer neighbours. Where the upright stems of trees, with their roots in their place as they grew, are found on the shore below high water mark, ' a catastrophe,' or ' a grand convulsion,' or ' a subsidence of the land,' or 'an oscillation of level' is inferred. Mantell calls these ' submerged forests,' or collections of stumps ' subterranean forests,' and he compares them to the silicified forest of the 'dirt-bed' of Bortland, and the along-shore boatmen are quite angry if you will not allow that where the sea is now a forest was ' before the flood.' But such ' catastrophes ' are, as I have stated in the Athe n\u00e6um, simply the result of the most gradual opera-"], [149, "Cu. VIII.] TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. 123 tion of rain, rivers and the sea. In former days the stream or the rain valley cuts its estuary far deeper even than low water mark, and forms what is called an arm of the sea. In later days the sea throws up a bank of shingle across the mouth of the deep-cut estuary, completely dams itself out and partially dams the streams in, though these often soak through the shingle at low water so as never to rise near the height of high water. Thousands of such cases exist in England. These sea beaches thrown up by storms frequently stand not only very much higher than the high water of the sea which throws them up, but the land be hind them is often much lower than the high water of the sea, and thus, according to circumstances, peat, pasture or wood grows below the high water mark. The rapidity of the growth of alluvial deposit from periodical inland floods is then much increased. For all the alluvial wash of the entire valley or waterslope is here at once stopped short, none of it can percolate the shingle into the sea ; deposit is rapidly accumulated on deposit, and rooted trees are found under peat, in peat, and above peat, not only on the shore outside the shingle-bank, but in cutting the sluices inside the shingle-bank, and by degrees the land which was below low water mark may be raised by alluvial deposit far above high water mark. When man"], [150, "124 TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. [Ch. VIII. Embanked land is denuded. appears on the scene, if fine alluvium plasters up the shingle enough to hold back the water, it is a common practice to dig a trench a few feet into the shingle which lets the water flow off in a stream, or if circumstances admit, a trench is cut through the shingle and occasionally cleared. Then come sluices and iron piping through the shingle bank. The land drainage is let out at low water and the sea kept out at high water. Millions of acres of our best pasturage are held on this tenure. But when the streams are embanked and are let off to the sea so perfectly as to prevent their natural annual overflow, annual denudation, of the old alluvium will take place instead of deposit of new alluvium, and the land may again become denuded far below the usual tidal level. The natural progress of such shingle banks is inward, that is, landward. In this progress they include and preserve the stems and roots of any trees which are in their line of march while the heads decay and fall. As the shingle bank travels inland the sea erodes the site on which the bank lately stood and exposes between high and low water the peat and the stems and roots which the shingle had covered. This may be seen at such places as Bevensey sluice, or at Bebblesham at the west end of St. Leonard's (and the Ham which the railroad traverses there is composed oi pebbles),"], [151, "Ch. VIII.] TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH. 125 at Hastings opposite Mantells 'diluvial valley.' In a minor way it may be seen in the bays of Torbay. To the centre of a bay, as Torbay, the beach travels from each horn, from Berry head and from Hope's nose by the same wind. Hence the accumulation of beach at thc centre of Baign ton, and the very same force which has carved this bay out of the soft sandstone between the two hard limestone heads throws up this bar of protection. The Baignton beach travels from the Torquay or Hope's nose side to the north foot of Boundham Head. The Goodrington beach travels from the Brixham (Brides-ham) or Berry head side to the south foot of Boundham head, and walls are built, not to keep back the sea ivater, but the sea land. Through these accumulations of beach the streams are now passed artificially. In former ages before art let the water out at low water, marshes, bogs and peat have accumulated behind the beach. Beat is seen in front of it now below high water mark. In this peat at Torre Abbey the stumps of trees are seen.

The materials of this sea drift have been placed in these six different positions under circumstances most distinct and in some cases at periods most distant one from the other. First and foremost, on our sea shores at this instant may be found mingled pebbles from every geological formation in England. Second, The same mixture is found in our raised beaches ; and since the shore on which the Romans built at Dover is at the same level as the present shore, our raised beaches must be at the least 2,000 years old. Third, the same mixture of travelled pebbles is found in the gravels which bed our upper dry chalk valleys. These gravels are, indeed, almost entirely angular, or only slightly worn and ..^travelled. They are the residuum of denudation. That is, while the wash of rain cut the valley through the clay- capped chalk, the travelled pebbles of the tertiary clays were dropped in the bottom together with the untravellcd angular secondary flint. Fourth, in the Druid sandstones of Froxfield, on the top of the clay-capped chalk hills of the Petersfield hangers, and in the pudding-stones of Bridestone lane, near Alton, I have found rounded pebbles of quartz mingled with pebbles of flint, and I should guess that as all conglomerates must have Origin of th. .Druid sand stone."], [154, "128 TRAVELLING OF SEA BEACH.

These Druid sandstones and conglomerates have nothing to do with icebergs, nor have they themselves travelled, though their materials have. They are simply sand or pebbles of tertiary sea shores acci dentally hardened into stone by water impregnated with iron, carbonate of lime, or flint. When they are on the bare chalk they also are the residuum of denudation, that is, these hard nodules remain after the soft clays have disappeared from the chalk by disintegration and the wash of rain. Fifth, over the entire surface of our ploughed land, whether of tertiary clay or of secondary chalk, the same mixture of travelled pebbles may be found. The clays have been deposited in the sea as a general rule farther out to sea than the sands, but in storms at high water sands and these pebbles have been washed into them. So that gravel-pits exist on our clay hill-tops entirely of rounded pebbles. When on the chalk, these pebbles must again be the residuum of denudation, that is, they remain after the clays which held them have disappeared by the wash of rain ; and Sixth, this marvellous mixture of travelled pebbles from granite and trap to the chalk flint is to be seen in the greensands of Woolmer Forest under the chalk.

About as much as they have collected the mixture of pebbles on our present sea-shores. The sands of Northern Germany and of European Bussia have been deposited in shallow seas. What then can be more natural than that lines of travelled boulders should remain where sea-shores were ? The Brighton ' Elephant Bed ' rests on an ancient sea beach containing such a mixture of boulders. The Elephant bed itself is composed of unworn or slightly worn materials. Chalk rubble, loam, chalk flints and masses of Druid sandstone and conglomerates. These are some times cemented into what is called coombe rock by water containing carbonate of lime. Through out the Elephant bed the remains of elephants, horses, deer and oxen are found. The shingle of the ancient beach below contains boulders of por phyry, granite and slate. The sand below the shingle contains bones of whales with sea shell fish of existing species. I consider this Elephant bed to be a land drift which reached the sea shore after the beach was raised.

The cliff becomes ' a sloping cliff inland,' and down its steep sides the Elephant bed has passed simply by the ivash of rain and has been deposited on the dry ancient beach. It is a land drift deposited on land, and therefore contains remains of land animals, consequently its materials are unworn or only slightly worn. But it is curious to consider the mixture of tra velled materials, organic and inorganic, which meet in this land drift and the ancient and modern beaches below without the aid of ice or icebergs or waves of translation, but by the simple opera tions of rain, rivers and the sea. The sea not only peremptorily refuses burial to our dead in her vast cemetery ; but how often does she cast her own dead on to our shores, and thus we here find the largest animals of the land not mingled but in contact with the largest inhabitants of the deep.

She dams the sea out with its own beach and shovels the contents of the \"widening, ever lowering, ever lengthening valley into the estuary. Or in other cases, at her omnipotent will she makes the victorious land to follow the sea into its own regions, and protrudes a delta into it of thousands of square miles in extent. So in the case of Giens and of Bortland, Nature has no sooner divided the island from the continent than by hoisting up the land she sets the same workman, the sea, whom she first em ployed to sever them from the land, to join them to the land again.

But the area of aqueous denudation, or wash of rain, is still more universal than the area of vegetation.

The beds of glaciers suffer denudation. the avalanche and the glacier bring down debris with them to be disintegrated below. Indeed, glaciers bring down their huge quota, ready ground for exportation by the torrents which they generate. According to Saussure, four of these main channels, or trunk lines of denudation, are continuous from the top of Mont Blanc, and from these the debris of ' the monarch of moun tains ' are traced for great distances. That the beds of the valleys of glaciers suffer denudation like those of other valleys, I think we may infer for two reasons. First, the grooves or lines scratched on the sides of the valleys by the passage of the glaciers are discovered far above their present level. Next, if this were not so, there would be an abrupt break or step from the glacier valley to the valley in prolongation of it. Besides the moraines or heaps of undigested detritus deposited by glaciers at their lowest ends, the streams which issue from them are always loaded with mud. These streams are flooded in the spring and summer, when the snows melt, to such a degree that, Saussure says, they raise the level of the Lake of Geneva six feet in that season.

And the waters of the lake and of the sea are as blue as the sky above them in clear weather ; but in cloudy weather they are lead-colour. The same argument will prove that the parts of mountains covered with perpetual snow suffer aqueous denudation precisely the same as all other parts of the earth. For if not, along the lower line of snow we should find terraces the reverse of those of Glen Boy, and similar to some which I shall mention in the next chapter ; that is, the terraces would be above the denuded parts instead of below them. Summer rains, and the melting of snow by summer suns, percolate the snow, and what does not enter the ground runs off it, and denudes it the same as if there were no snow. But it is a fallacy to suppose that if a ' glacial epoch ' had ever existed, a greater denu dation would have gone on than now goes on by rain and rivers. The cause of the descent of glaciers is simply the pressure of snow from above their upper ends. Mr. Hopkins (' Philosophical Magazine,' October 1859), is as unfortunate here with his glacial mathematics as he is in the Weald with his igneous mathematics. He talks of ' the tendency of such"], [162, "136 SEDG WICK'S DOCTRINE THAT [Ch.

Very much so. But then, no doubt, it equally as true is that '\u25a0an enormous iceight of ice' can no more slide down a slight incline than a small weight of ice can. Or if it can, perhaps the mathematician will tell us why it can. And on slopes of two or three degrees, and on all the slopes of the lower ends of glaciers, solids large or small (and among them ice) would rest motionless. If a glacier could be extracted from its valley, the valley would be instantly filled again by the fall of the snow from above into it, which snow was before supported by the upper end of the glacier. It is only the pres sure of this snow from above, which pushes the glacier down ; abstract this pressure from above, that is, let all the snow be abstracted from Mont Blanc, and let no more snoAv fall, every glacier would cease instantly to move downward. They woidd retreat upward by melting, and would finally disappear ; even above the former snow line, they would melt in summer suns. But as snow constantly does fall on Mont Blanc, and as it"], [163, "Ch. IX.] DENUDATION IS ONLY ON LINES. 137 That ice and snow must m crease at the poles is falla cious. cannot melt there in the same proportion as it falls, it would constantly accumulate there unless it was constantly shoving the glaciers down towards the sea, as rain is constantly shoving the whole surface of the earth down towards the sea. Owing to the friction of the bed of the valley, the central ice yields most easily to the pressure from above, and travels most quickly. This principle obtains also in rivers, though water is neither viscous nor brittle. But Brofessor Forbes is unfortunate in calling ice (one of the most brittle things we know), viscous. A glacier travels at different rates in different parts, or alters its form to the form of the valley on the same principle that holds in the ice-house, that is, by being pounded to atoms and freezing solid again. This results from extreme brittleness, the very reverse of viscousness. Though ice and snow perpetually surround the two poles, it is not the same ice and snow, any more than the snow on the mountain top or the water in the river continues the same. And the idea that ice and snow must increase at the poles is fallacious. Every year thousands of enormous mountains, we might say continents, of ice (all bearing mud, earth, and stones) float off, and are melted in more temperate latitudes. The causes of increase or decrease of snow which may"], [164, "138 sedgwick's doctrine that [Ch. IX. Mountains while rising may be de creasing in height. occur at the poles, are shown by a magnificent theory of the illustrious Lyell. It does not follow that while mountains are rising they are increasing in height. They may be decreasing in height. Suppose the Alps to have been rising six inches in a century for my riads of years, if their denudation has been seven inches in a century, they have been decreasing in height. It is true that the direct action in waste and denudation of torrents and rivers is on lines only ; and were it not for the atmospheric disintegration and the lateral wash of rain this their direct action would only cut ravines and channels to the sea, and the sides of all valleys, instead of sloping, would be cliffs ; that is, where a spring issues high up the mountain side, it will cut a deep ravine with precipitous cliffs, and the deeper it cuts, the more springs it will lay open. But what widens this ravine into a broad valley with gently sloping sides ? The lateral wash of rain into the longitudinal valley. And what forms the broad valley, even where there is no river at the bottom ? or within many miles ? The longitudinal scooping power of the concentrated wash of rain, which in no respect differs from that of the torrent, except in its being a hundred-fold more powerful than the torrent. It is indeed intermittent ; so is"], [165, "Ch. IX.] DENUDATION IS ONLY ON LINES. 139 the real scooping force of the torrent, for torrents only really excavate when swollen by rain. A torrent swollen by rain to perhaps twenty times the volume of its usual spring water, and hurling fragments of rocks along of all sizes, is, in point of excavating and destructive power, as much more formidable than its usual self as a shotted gun is more formidable than an unshotted gun. We never see the clear torrent set its rocky am munition in movement, though the shape of this ammunition tells us how often, and for what distances, it has been projected. But when the torrent is turbid with the wash of rain, we can hear its huge cannon balls rattling down, and grinding each other and their rocky bed and banks, till what has started from the mountain's brow as a huge rock arrives at the sea in the form of pebbles or of sand. For although, as the flood of rain subsides, the flow of boulder stones ceases, this is only for a time ; each rain sets them on a stage on their journey, as, in lower levels and gentler gradients, will be seen of soil, and the more minute particles formed by disintegration and vegetable chemistry.

But the widening of these loncritudinal ravines into broad valleys by disintegration and the lateral wash of rain is a process infinitely slow in comparison to what takes place in districts of softer sub soils. But as sure as dry land stands betwixt high heaven and the sea, the waters of heaven will wash it into the sea. And whether the dry land be of soft or of hard material simply makes the difference of the comparative time required for the operation. In soft and porous subsoils, as the tertiary and chalk, though nature does not make so much fuss about the affair, she proceeds equally surely. The top of the same Hampshire hill, which may be chalk capped with tertiary strata, is on one side moving to the German Ocean, through the medium of the Thames, and on the other side to the English Channel, by the Itchen, forming one of Humbolt's ' fissures,' or Mr. Hopkins 's ' fractures.'

In the night of Friday, the 6th of January, 1854, a rapid thaw began, with heavy rain. I walked from Botherfield to Brookwood on Saturday. Owing to the hard frost the ground absorbed no water. It stood on the high road at East Tisted more than a foot deep, nature's gradient being dammed up by the cross road of man. Over this, the water flowed into the Lavant, from Farringdon, by Chawton and Maiden Lane, to the east of Alton, into the Wey and Thames. In following the high road from Tisted up the north-east side of Filmere Hill, I saw a continuous stream along the valley, running from near Ashen Wood. Where the valley was crossed by the new enclosures of West Tisted Common, the water was ponded back into lakes till it flowed over the small banks on which these fences stand. And (risum te neatis amici ?) if left to nature precisely the same processes of filling up these lakes and cutting down their barriers would go on as have been described in the ancient lakes of Auvergne and in the valley of the St. Lawrence.

The streams of these two usually dry trunk valleys were joined by very strong streams from their usually dry branch valleys. In such a case, where the surface of the ground is frozen hard, one would suppose that very little of the soil would be washed away ; yet whenever snow is drifted, be the ground ever so hard frozen, a great quantity of soil is drifted with it. ' White as the driven snow,' is an expression as trite as it is poetical. But as the driven snow melts, its surface becomes anything rather than white. The melting snow percolates through itself in the form of water, and the whole of the soil, which is mingled with its entire bulk, is gradually accumulated on the surface, giving the drift the appearance of soil rather than of snow. And when the drift has entirely melted, a residuum of earth is deposited on the ground.

In an attempt to ascend Mont Blanc, before our arrival for the night at ' Saussure 's house,' I counted in a rent, or crevasse, of a glacier which we passed, many years of snow. The top of each of these annual beds was clearly marked in black, and I think it quite probable that an aerial deposit takes place over the entire snowy surface of Mont Blanc. I need not remark that this portage of soil by wind must take place in all frosts, inde pendent of snow drifts. Though the effect of this widely operating cause will not be so ap parent as when its burthen ' violates the ingenuous snow.' What is shoved along the bottom by water (for instance, shingle) is arrested on the near side of any obstacle, but what is held in sus pension in a stream is deposited on the farther side. And a comparatively small object, say a drifted tree grounded in a river, by causing a back-water or eddy, may form a huge mud bank or island below it, which may change the course of the river. It is very curious to remark the huge drifts of snow which very slight objects will collect on their leeward sides. But as the wind, unlike the stream, is constantly shifting-"], [171, "Ch.

There are, however, some places, as the tops of bare hills, which are constantly denuded by wind, and others, such as woods, which are constantly enriched by wind ; and as they are free from aerial denudation the soil of woods is more than compensated even for the crops taken from them by man. A part of the products of vegetation may be said to be stored in the bodies of animals. And as carnivorous animals prey on the herbivorous, a part even in carnivorous animals, but the longest lived animals and plants, die, and their hardest parts decay ; so that, on the average, the entire mass of a year's growth of all ter restrial vegetation may be considered as taken annually from below the surface and annually deposited afresh above the surface. Much of the organic or combustible part of this growth goes into the atmosphere in the form of gases, to be returned again to the earth in rain. Of the inorganic or incombustible part, or what would be the ashes of plants and animals if burnt, much is washed into the earth by rain, much ploughed in as manure, much washed into the sea with other soil.

So in dry windy weather, when cultivated lands are thoroughly cleansed and broken finely for sowing, great quantities, even of soil, change places by wind, by which exposed spots are impoverished, and sheltered spots enriched.

A very slight difference in hardness of surface or thickness of vegetation at the brow of a hill may concentrate the wash of rain into a stream ; this forms a channel, which is fed by rain from its sides. And though all possible natural acci dents of this sort might have been supposed to have taken place long ago in all but volcanic or newly raised regions, Lyell, quoting Sir T. D. Lauder's account of the great floods in Moray shire, August 1829, says, ' Some new ravines were formed on the sides of mountains where no streams had previously flowed, and ancient river channels which had never been filled from time immemorial gave passage to a copious flood.'

This was the effect of one continuous heavy rain. And in the present day we may see ravines begun by the accidental results of many opera tions of man. A hedge or ditch, a pathway or waggon-way, may commence the furrow on the mountain's brow, nay, even on downs which are covered with the closest greensward ; and how many of our bye-roads and lanes become ravines ! Indeed, as the long conduits whose gradients are laid by the wash of rain, very generally become the roads or lines of traffic of man, so, vice versa, the roads or lines of traffic of man, on or near declivities, very generally become conduits for the wash of rain. Hence our ' hol low ways,' ' sunk lanes,' and sunk roads' Hollow ways are so common as to give their name to men as well as to places. In fact, the moment roads or lanes leave the line of the valley, the moment they cross the hills from one valley to the other, that moment they become more or less"], [175, "Ch. X.] 149 AND ON THE GANGES. sunk roads. And this, ' more or less,' depends on the steepness of the hills, without reference to comparative hardness : that is, the steeper the hill, the deeper the sinking of the road. The reason is, that roads on declivities are channels for the wash of rain, and they partake of the nature of narrow valleys or ravines. In pro portion as the surface of declivities is hard and un porous, the wash of rain and its power accumulate ; so that, although declivities whose surfaces are soft are from this reason more easily abraded, by their porousness, which is generally a con sequence of their softness, they are to a certain extent protected from denudation. That a founda tion of the hardest rock will not support these modern gangways of man, witness the high cliffs on the sides of each Devonshire sunk lane. Where the subsoil is soft, as chalk, instead of cliffs, the banks mutter away, and shelve off, and where trees or coppice wood grow, have an over hanging coping of roots and earth. When a road runs horizontally along the side of a hill its upper side is loaded and its lower side denuded. When a road follows the centre of a dry upper valley with a fence on each side, it very generally becomes ' sunk.' And this appearance is in creased by the fences stopping the wash of soil to"], [176, "[Ch. X. 150 LYELL ON NEW RAVINES the centre of the valley, and so raising the ground on each side of the road. But no road running along the top of a ridge or hog's-back ever becomes ' sunk.' The deposit from the wash of rain on each side of all level roads is soon covered with growth ; it then catches the dust or aerial deposit, and unless the pickaxe and shovel are constantly at work the drainage of the road is soon choked up. In comparison to the broad waste from the wash of rain the waste by the direct action of rivers may be reckoned as nothing ; and even this waste by the direct action of rivers takes place, I might say, entirely when they are flooded by rain. The real main geological work of rivers is indirect; that is, the carrying off the traffic brought to them by the wash of rain ; and they carry this mighty traffic for the entire terrestrial surface of the globe ; at least their channels do. And the channels of most rivers would exist whether the rivers existed or not, as in the south you constantly see river beds dry or almost dry, except when filled by the superficial run of rain or the thawing of mountain snow ; and the size of the channels of all torrents and rivers (except in alluvial parts, for a reason which is given in chapter xv.) is in proportion to the heavy floods of rain which occasionally rush through them, not to the corn-"], [177, "151 Ch.

Lyell, quoting Mr. Everest, calculates that in the rainy season (four months) the flooded Ganges discharges into the sea a weight of earth equal to fifty-six great pyramids, and in the other eight months only the weight of four pyramids. Now if Brofessor Sedgwick will only grant us these four pyramids for the snows of the Himalaya, we shall have an annual superficial wash of soil amounting in weight to sixty pyramids. This is the ordinary and annual work resulting from the operation of ordinary and annual rains on one river basin. But how many extraordinary floods, the result of ex traordinary rains, have passed over the Ganges ! Does Brofessor Sedgwick think that all this soil comes every year from the erosion of the banks of the Ganges, or even from the valley of the Ganges ? If it did, the valley of the Ganges would soon be barer of soil than its declivities. The soil comes from a great part of all the tops, and from all the sides of all the declivities of all the myriads of valleys ramifying from all the tributary valleys of the valley of the Ganges ; and what has passed into the sea in the forma tion of the valley is a mere nothing to what has passed down the valley and does now pass down it, from the denudation of those infinitely extended"], [178, "152 [Ch. X. LYELL ON NEW RAVINES surfaces by rain. In the rainy season, there is, perhaps, a body of surface-wetter which flows down the vale to the sea in volume fifteen times as great as the spring water ; and were every spring of the Ganges permanently dried up, the vale would still be flooded every year by a stream in volume only less by a fifteenth part than that which flows every rainy season now, and fourteen times greater than that which flows in the three hot months. The following will show what has formerly come down, and what still does come down the sides of the Himalaya into the valley of the Ganges. 'A very ancient subterranean town, apparently of Hindoo origin, was discovered in India in 1833, in digging the Doab canal. Its site is north of Saharunpore, near the town of Behat, and seven- teen feet below the present surface of the country. More than 170 coins of silver and copper have already been found, and many articles in metal and earthenware. The overlying deposit consisted of about five feet of river sand, with a sub- stratum, about twelve feet thick, of red alluvial clay. In the neighbourhood are several rivers and torrents, which descend from the mountains charged with vast quantities of mud, sand, and shingle, and within the memory of persons now living the modern Behat has been threatened by"], [179, "Ch.

In sink ing wells in the environs masses of shingle and boulders have been reached, resembling those now in the river channels of the same district, under a deposit of thirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed the excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has gradually raised the whole country, skirting, the base of the lower hills and that the ancient town having been originally built in a hollow, was submerged by floods, and covered over with sedi ment, seventeen feet in thickness' ('Brinciples'). Denudation by rain extends over the whole space of the earth. Its pace will be modified hastened, or retarded, or partially stopped, by a thousand such circumstances as comparative hard ness of surface, porousness, levelness, vegetation, heaviness of rain, hedges, and fences, &c. &c. Over vast tracts, denudation by rain is so slow as to be inappreciable. Still there is perhaps, scarcely any place in nature where excessive continued rain will not run ; and this run will be discoloured. This discolouration will be from soil ; and this soil will be deposited where the rain ceases to run.

But the chief thing which diminishes and re- tards the effect of the wash of rain is the very force of the cause. This force, speaking liberally, has thrown the whole surface of the earth into ridge and furrow, into these graduated vales slop- ing to the sea ; so that all the broad superficial runs of this wash are shortened, and are made lateral into these longitudinal channels. We shape our roads high in the middle on this principle, to throw the rain off on each side with the shortest possible run into the ditch or gutter, and to pre- vent a wash along the road, which would otherwise soon wash our artificial road away. Were it otherwise in nature, were there one plane descent from the tops of all the hills and mountains, the volume of the superficial wash of rain, increasing as it descended, would many times in the year desolate the whole of the lower parts of the hills and mountains ; and the lower parts of the hill sides would have less soil than the upper parts ; they would be as bare of soil as the channels of torrents. The channels of torrents and rivers prevent this effect now ; they are nature's ditches and gutters, so that, in this light"], [181, "Ch. X.] 155 AND ON THE GANGES. The source of the valley is always higher up than the source of the river. rivers may be regarded as a conservative, not a destructive, power. But rivers are mere labourers or accessories in the affair. The wash of rain is the engineer which has laid out the gradients of this preventive surface drainage over the entire area of the earth. The source of the valley is always much higher up than the source of the river ; I mean than the spring source of the river, for the snow source or glacier source being both superficial sources, I consider the same as the rain source of the valley. The river has no power of making a valley above it ; but a torrent of rain water has the power of scooping a valley below it. Even on Salisbury Plain, which is comparatively flat, and covered with the closest greensward, these dry valleys, or rather continuations of valleys, above the heads of rivers, exist : and that the cause which caused them still works may be argued from the valleys being richer in soil than the tops or sides of the hills, owing to the gentle gradients of the bottoms of the valleys ; for other things the same, that is, in the same strata, with the same vegetation, &c, one universal result of the wash of rain is, that the degree of denudation of soil will be directly as steepness.

When these chalky downs are ploughed up, the brow of the hill shows light, and the soil darkens in descending. This is from the rain washing the soil quickly down the hill, which is not so quickly supplied to the brow from the flatter top of the hill. Here the universal wash of rain may be seen. When one field comprehends the head of an entire coomb in a chalk country, the semicircular brow of the coomb in like manner showTs light, and the soil darkens to the bottom of the coomb. When such a field is cropped, the crop also is light on the brow, and heavy in the bottom of the coomb. Here the universal wash of rain may not only be seen by the farmer but felt by him. This universal portage of soil by rain, the eternal effect of eternal causes, which in huge"], [183, "157 Ch. X.] AND ON THE GANGES. spaces of time results in such vast geological changes, may also be seen oculis fidelibus when ever a fence runs horizontally along the side of a hill. A natural terrace is then formed. For aqueous denudation goes on below the fence, and in chalk countries the ground becomes white ; and not only does aqueous denudation cease above the fence, but aqueous deposit takes place, and the good soil which was on its way to the valley is arrested. Even a slight dead wattle, if kept up, will produce this effect, and though the hedge is dead the ground on which it is placed will grow. In France I have seen deep terraces result from very narrow strips left uncultivated to divide fields or properties. If the subsoil is hard rock, say the Devonian lime stone or slate, the rock shows bare below each horizontal fence and rich soil collects above it. A gateway wrongly placed will often let considerable quantities of this collection of the best soil escape, which might otherwise have accumulated for what man might call for ever. So an injudicious down hill waggon-way, across fields, will sometimes act as a channel, and catching soil laterally convey it away from its proper owner. If your neighbour's land lies below you on a steep hill side, unless you wish to make him a present of your best soil, pound"], [184, "158 [Ch. X. LYELL ON NEW RAVINES it back on to your own land by a fence, and when it accumulates against your fence cart it up the hill again. The beautiful artificial terracing of the hill side, which we see in southern mountain culti vation, originates in the necessity of catching the stream of soil from above, and preventing its farther descent to the valley below, down which it would be washed, whether it were a dry valley or a river valley. In unusually heavy rains, numbers of these terrace walls give way ; and when a terrace goes which is high up the hill side, a sort of earthen avalanche takes place, bearing crops, soil, and stone walls in succession to the vale below. In these works man shows himself as a strono* conservative. In alluding to man as a leveller, our great geologist admirably remarks : ' By ploughing up thousands of square miles, and exposing a surface for part of the year to the action of the elements, we assist the abrading force of rain, and diminish the conservative effects of vegetation ; ' and by fencing these thousands of square miles, man acts as a very universal conservative.

I believe that in many cases where the country is composed of soft and porous materials, as chalk, the depth of the valleys and channels scooped out by rain lays open the springs, and forms the rivers, instead of the rivers forming the valleys. How many dry valleys are there sloping to the sea, without having laid open a spring, and there fore without any stream ? And what formed these valleys ? How many lateral or branch dry valleys are there falling into the main longi tudinal dry valley, whose lower end joins the upper end of the river valley?

Deep mud is instantly deposited over the whole bottom of the pond, and a boggy delta where the stream enters. This is from the lateral wash of soil into the river in heavy rains. We have only to look at the complexion of the river to see this. And the river deposits the mud in the pond, which it would otherwise have carried down to the sea. I will instance the ponds at Alresford and at Warnford. This was so published in the first edition in 1S57. At this moment (November 1858) an enormous gang of navvies, at an enor mous expense, are emptying of mud the artificial lake at Avington. Yet the lake is clear of the main stream of the Itchen, which still deposits the main stream of mud below, that is, in the sea and on the banks of the Southampton water, while above Avington every branch of the Itchen has its mud-trap, namely, Alresford pond, the artificial lake at the Grange, and that at Tichborne. Every river, even the purest and clearest, is an outlet of mud as well as of water. And every puddle, and every pond, and every lake, and every sea, is a receptacle of mud as well as of water.

Nature is not only the great quartz-crusher by decomposition, but also the great gold-washer by rain and rivers. And whenever circumstances will permit she sifts and sorts the drift, and drops the gold down on to the 'bed-rock' on which the alluvium rests, or to the bottom of each stratum of the alluvium as perfectly as the gold- washer does to the bottom of the box below his cradle. However geologists may differ as to the original formation of matrix gold in quartz, or the original formation of flints in chalk, there is not a geologist existing who will not allow that alluvial gold has once been matrix gold, and has been rotted out of the rocks which contained it by atmospheric disintegration, as surface flints come from the rotting of the chalk which contained them into soil, and as china clay comes from the rotting of granite. Now granite and quartz are two of the most durable rocks on earth, yet the very geologists who allow this enormous rotting of these, the hardest rocks, deny the constant decay of the softer ones. Gold released from rock by rotting, like flints released from chalk by rotting, may be on the surface for ages before it is drifted into an alluvial bed by water. But of all the drift driven by water gold is the heaviest, and so has a tendency to sink M"], [188, "162 [Ch. X LYELL ON NEW RAVINES sooner and deeper than anything of the same size and shape. Alluvial gold, therefore, is found on the rock or bed on which the alluvium rests, because that is the bottom of the first stratum. So it is found on the top of the first stratum, because that supports the bottom of the second stratum, and so the divisions or partings of the strata are the chief receptacles for the coarse gold as it is called, though fine particles may be washed out of any part through an alluvium of perhaps 300 feet in depth, and any number of miles in length. The builders of these enormous deposits have not been monstrous convulsions or disastrous floods, still less ' glacial epochs,' but simply rain and rivers, that is, quiet atmospheric disintegra tion and the wash of ram. And that these builders are still at this work I quote a practical witness. Mr. Howitt writes (' Land, Labour, and Gold,' letter xxxv.), ' These slates, sandstones, and other perishable substances holding gold being thus brought to the surface (where they are in places so conspicuous near these perpendicular dykes lately described), have gradually undergone de composition from the action of the atmosphere and of rains, and this by degrees liberated the cold which has been washed into the streams"], [189, "163 Ch. X.] AND ON THE GANGES. China clay. and valleys. This action is still going on, and, therefore, after great rains, yoii will often find gold deposited in the roots of the weeds and shrubs in the, creeks' ' A most striking proof of the results of the gradual decomposition of the surface, we found in the creek which we worked at the Upper Yackandanda. The gold was found in the mud of the creek, resting on a stratum of clay, at about a depth of two feet. But on digging through the clay we found fresh drift of three feet deep, which must have been the accumulation of centuries. Neither in that, how ever, nor in the rock beneath, was there the slightest deposit of gold. It was quite evident that the gold had only begun to wash into the creek from the surrounding slopes at a com paratively recent period, because these slopes had only then begun to undergo decomposition.' A sudden flood cannot rot or decompose. But how many centuries must it have required to rot and decompose the granite from the felspar of winch the china-clay beds of Cornwall and Devonshire come? The same rotting is going on now. The Tor reverses the law of the sugar basin.

The great Laplace has guessed, as some think very erroneously, that the average depth of the sea might be about the average height of the land, or 3280 feet. From Sir James Boss's soundings ('Brinciples,' page 105), it would appear that the greatest depths of the sea may not differ much from the greatest height of moun tains. Our highest mountain would be represented by a grain of sand, on a globe of six feet in diameter. Therefore, the deepest part of the sea would be represented by the cast or impression of a grain of sand on such a globe. What a puddle then is the sea, in point of cubical con tents, compared with the solid globe !

This water carries with it solids to the sea, which sink to the bottom of the sea ; and the same act which sinks the solids of the globe raises the liquids of the globe. Every one must see that this all-pervading* ever-acting circle of causes must result in depositing existing continents under the sea.

Blayfair originated this idea in his magnificent illustrations of our yet unappreciated Hutton. Herschel, the immortal son of an immortal father, has confirmed it. Herschel, however, with Lyell, makes the sea, acting on its shores, ' grind down ' the solids, instead of the universal circle of causes. If this is so, we shall have some high cliffs at Chimboraco, and along the Andes. A cliff 24,000 feet in height would be worth seeing. What a squat, tame cone the Beak of Tenerife would be to this ! But what average height would Orographers allow for the cliff from Banama to Batagonia? 15,000 feet? Inconvenient for land ing even if it was only 1500.

And we may reject the idea of the original fluidity of the globe, whether igneous or aqueous, and the universal chaotic ocean, velut \u00e6gri somnia. I will take Mr. M'Clausland (' Sermons in Stones'), as the latest expositor of the ' igneous fusion' theory, which was originated by Leibnitz nearly two centuries ago (1680). According to this theory, the globe began as a mass of matter melted by heat.

Between the granite and the Devonian beds are deposited, over the whole globe, 1st. the Azoic or Cambrian beds, 26,000 feet thick, and above these, the Silurian, 30,000 feet thick, making together a coating to the entire terrestrial globe of upwards of ten miles in thickness. This enormous growth over the entire globe is, ' gram by grain, and layer by layer, raised by deposit from the granite bed of the ancient ocean.' That is, it is raised from the bed on winch it is deposited, so that the last or uppermost mile of deposit must have passed through the first or lowermost nine miles of deposit. It is true that in other parts of the work mud issues from the melted mass, and ' muddy vapour ' from the sea. But how mud got into the mass melted by heat, or how it issued from the melted mass as mud does not appear. But suppose sufficient incandescent mud to be ejected to increase the diameter of the globe at any and every point twenty miles, would there be no collapse ? or no inletting of the sea ? and conse quent laying bare of dry land ?

This would indeed well account for the appearance of some dry land in the Devonian period, when according to Mr. M'Clausland, dry land first appeared ; though, according to common sense, till dry land did appear there could be no denudation, and conse quently no deposit on ' the granite bed of the ancient ocean.' If the incandescent theory is true, I think it follows that in process of time, as internal heat cools, all organic existence, vegetable and animal, must die a natural death of cold. Also that as internal heat ceases to replace continents as they are washed beneath the wave, we must end in a chaotic ocean, as the incandescent theory supposes that we began.

Or rather is it not pure Brahminism? For ' Brahma on awaking from sleep always finds the world a shapeless ocean.' And when Brahma goes to sleep again ' the universe is reduced to one vast ocean.' Very great philosophers have asserted that evaporation from surfaces of moist earth is as great as from equal surfaces of water. If this is true, it does not follow that we are equally indebted to equal surfaces of land as to equal surfaces of water for our rain, since surfaces of earth have a trick of becoming dry after a certain degree of evaporation. That we are mainly indebted for our rain to evaporation from the sea I stated thus in a letter to the Hampshire paper in September 1845. The moisture which rises through the air must be equal to that which falls through it. But vast quantities (say half) which fall on earth run into the sea by rivers.

As the moisture which is absorbed by vegeta tation is returned to the atmosphere, I consider it in the same account as that which is absorbed and returned by the earth. For vegetables while they live exhale, and when they die they dry. If a tree lives a thousand years, and its heart wood is always moist, even if it were proved that that moisture were unchanged, the thousand years come to an end, and on the average, a year's absorption of moisture by vegetation is annually returned to the air. No standing water, however, can retain the same level for two successive days, but must be always rising from rain or falling from evaporation. When we consider the difference of level from these opposite causes every instant progressing in open oceans, the marvel is that the currents are as gentle and as regular as they are supposed to be.

Lyell supposes ' that the hydrogen evolved during the process of satura tion may, on coming afterwards in contact with the heated metallic oxides, reduce them again to metals ; and this circle of action may be one of the principal means by which internal heat and the stability of volcanic energy are preserved.' If these doctrines are correct, the circle of causes, now in operation, is perfect ; and there is no reason why the existence of this world should ever go out of itself, or perish except by the will of the omnipotent God who created it. The earth eternal, unless destroyed by the will of God. This is not so with the species of plants and animals which exist on the globe. Unless we except man (as I think we may), the existence of all organic species is not only finite, but it is transi tory as compared with the existence of the globe, and it depends on second causes. The existence of species transitory, and dependent on second causes. Every local change in physical geography works not only a local but a general change in climate and physical conditions over the whole globe.

The Great Artificer authoritatively and abso lutely contradicts all this, by having, possibly from all time, and apparently successively and at distinct times, and in comparatively modern times, created distinct existences or species, and kept these distinct species separate under pre cisely similar physical conditions. This is the case with animals, vegetables, birds, reptiles, in sects, fish, shell animals, and zoophytes, whether any of all these named are terrestrial, or aquatic, or amphibious, or peculiar to fresh, brackish, or salt-water. And not only is this so now, but apparently through an indefinite number of ages the terraqueous globe has been thus gra dually and in succession stocked and restocked with species entirely distinct from those existing in this or in any two of the different periods. Indeed, supposing species to have originated from single stocks, the creation of existing species could not have been simultaneous.

Plants must have multiplied before herbivorous animals were turned among them, and herbivorous ani mals before carnivorous animals were allowed to prey on them. Humboldt says no. Humboldt saj's we might have lived on fish, which were doubtless created in shoals. For ' the existence of races of men inhabiting the icy regions of the north polar lands, and whose nutriment is solely derived from fish and the cetaceans shows the possibility of main taining life independently of vegetable substances.' And animals ? and birds ? Horace's doves and kids? were they, too, ichthyophagous?

We all see this in temperate regions ; and I will instance only some of the . largest quadrupeds, herbivorous and carnivorous, on the extremes of cold and heat, because these could not exist in regions which were not replete with vegetable and animal life for their food. In the arctic regions we find the musk-ox, the reindeer, the huge polar bear, the wolf, the seal, the whale, &c. ; in the tropics, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the camel, the giraffe, the lion, the hippopotamus, the shark, &c. But nature is by no means content with this wonderful adaptation of her organic creation to differing physical con ditions. Like the chicken-fancier, who keeps his fowl-yards separate, nature seems purposely to have contrived different stations with similar physical conditions, in order to exhibit the pro fuseness of her creative power, in cramming all full of animal and vegetable existences, with con stitutions similar to those of similar but separate stations, but the species of each similar separate station differing entirely from the species of all other similar separate stations.

M. Alph. de Candolle, son of the great De Candolle, enumerates twenty seven great nations of distinct indigenous abori ginal plants. That the plants and animals of such vast districts of stations as America and Australia should be different from those of every other part of the globe, from which they are so completely divided, does not strike one with so much astonish ment as that there should be ' found one assem blage of species in China, another in the countries bordering the Black Sea, and a third in those surrounding the Mediterranean.' Here, distance and prior occupancy seem to take the duties of natural barriers. But, however small, and how ever comparatively modern, the spot, if it be inclosed by natural barriers (as, for instance, St. Helena), it will apparently have a creation for itself. So in the Galapagos islands, of which there are ten principal islands, under the line, 600 miles westward of America, of modern origin, judging from the fresh appearance of about 2000 craters.

Of twenty-six different species of laud birds found in the Galapagos archipelago, all, with the exception of one, are distinct from those inhabiting other parts of the globe ; and in other archipelagoes, a single island sometimes contains a species found in no other spot on the whole earth.' Wings themselves furnish no exception to the rule. The Creator hangs his cages, containing distinct birds, in distinct separate regions, though those distinct separate regions may have precisely the same physical conditions. Lyell quotes Darwin : ' The archipelago is a little world within itself. One is astonished at the amount of creative force displayed on so many small, barren, and rocky islands, and still more so at its diverse, yet analogous, action on points so near each other. I have said that the Galapagos archipelago might be called a satellite attached to America ; but it should rather be called a group of satellites, physically similar, organically distinct, yet inti mately related to each other, and all related in a marked, though much lesser, degree to the great American continent.'

This forming or trans forming of the surface is, however, all that is claimed for rain. On the subject of the original forming of the land by fire, Humboldt uses plenty of sesquipe dalian words, and quotes authors from Eratos thenes downward. I shall be satisfied with one quotation from one author : Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. With regard to the cause of the form of the land : ' Very little can be empirically determined re garding the causal connexion of the phenomena of the formation of continents, or of the analogies and contrasts presented by then: configuration. All that we know regarding this subject resolves itself into this one point, that the active cause is subterranean, that continents did not arise at once in the form they now present, but were, as we have already observed, increased by degrees, by means of numerous oscillatory elevations and depressions of the soil, or, were formed by the fusion of separate smaller continental masses.' With regard to the effect of this cause, in con junction with Bacon, Bolybius, and Eratosthenes, Humboldt calls our attention to ' the pyramidal"], [212, "186 FIRE FORMS COxMTINENTS, [Ch. XIII. configuration of all the southern extremities of continents.' Here we become mithraic, and Humboldt shows us more BYBamids even than Eratosthenes. The letter A has also a ' pyramidal configura tion,' and four out of five of oui' continents, which end in pyramids, begin and end with this pyramidal letter, ASIA, AFEICA, AMEEICA, and AUSTBALIA. Axis, Arctic, and Antarctic, also begin with it. These coincidences cannot be accidental. I do not pretend to class myself with the gentlemen named above. But I do think that this one original idea of mine is likely to be as useful, and is in all respects as worthy consideration in a co(s)mical way, as their joint stock company one. It is true that ' lands-ends ' are apt lo be pyramidal, to whatever point of the compass they may face. And if we saw as much of the northern lands-ends of our continents as we do of their southern lands-ends, they might show a fair share of pyramids. Indeed, since the time of Eratos thenes, the north of Europe at the north cape, and of Asia at the north-east cape, have been found to be pyramidal. Cape Barrow, to the westward of Mackenzie river in North America, is pyramidal, and the cape to the eastward of that river not a bad imitation of a pyramid."], [213, "Ch. XIII.] WATER TRANSFORMS THEM. 187 But, ' as the fool thinks, the bell clinks,' and if a man happens to be a fire- worshipper, and wishes to see a pyramid, he will see one in the section of a circle, and out of a square he will make four beauties. If a man does not wish to see pyramids, I do not think that he will see them in the south of Australia and New Zealand, which Humboldt quotes as continents, more than he will on the north of them, or of Borneo, or any island north or south from Iceland to Madagascar. Humboldt might make four pyramids out of the Isle of Wight, though, it would then be three to one against his southern theory. For, instead of all facing the south, they each face a cardinal point. And, ' the active cauee ' of these ' pyramidal configurations,' has been water, not fire. For the eroding force of the sea, being horizontal, forms horizontal pyramids, as the eroding force of rain, being vertical, forms vertical pyramids. Fire has had nothing to do with the form of the island farther than having raised it as a part of the mass which joined both England and France. Water is the sculptor who has formed the island out of this mass, and will continue to transform it till it has swallowed the last grain of it.

The present form of the region is due to water. To water we owe its infinitely varied features and beauties, its infinite alternation of ridge and fur row, hill and dale, its infinite ramification of stream and valley, streamlet and valleylet, and its great variety of geological strata. Nay, like the Isle of Wight, its veiy hills are as much formed by water out of the original mass as the statue is formed by the sculptor out of the original block. But since all the protuberances of the earth's crust have been thrust up by subterranean fire, and as the intervals between these protuberances may be called hollows, it may perhaps be asserted that these hollows are valleys, formed by fire, not by water. All seas and lakes are such hollows. From the top of Mont Blanc in the Alps to the Bocky Mountains in North America, or to the top of Chimboraco in the Andes, may in this sense be said to be a hollow. From the Andes westward to the Himalaya another, and between Europe and Africa a third. If these hollows are called the valleys of the Atlantic, Bacific, and Mediter ranean, then I confess that there are valleys in the world not formed by water.

I think Humboldt is too modest here ; he should call it my Atlantic. The sur face of ' our ' Atlantic is about twenty-five millions of square miles, and unless it was a sea before it was formed into a sea, it must have been sur mounted by a continent when it fell a victim to the ' eddying waters.' Besides, therefore, the depth of the sea, the height of the old continent must be added to the new one. Theoretically, the formation of this particular continent, the Tierra Humboldtiana, would differ from that of continents in general. For they, according to Humboldt, ' were formed by the fusion of separate, smaller, continental masses.' Practically, the difference of formation would be found great indeed.

It is lamentable to find an Englishman imposed on by such bombastic trash. Keith Johnston, in his Physical Atlas, says ' the Atlantic ocean occu pies the great longitudinal valley, extending,' &c. If this is not an abuse of terms, we may say that three quarters of the surface space of the globe are occupied by one valley, and that the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic, Indian, China, Medi terranean, Black, White, Yellow, Bed, Baltic, Caribbean seas, with all their innumerable gulfs, bays, straits, and rivers, are only parts, particular nooks, corners, and lanes in this one valley. That the valley of the Thames is part of the same valley as the China sea and the Yang-tse-Kiang. In my view, seas are no more valleys than val leys are seas. Valleys are subaerial hollows, and not subaqueous hollows. A valley is, in my view, a waterslope, and this waterslope must be con tinuous to the sea, or to an inland lake. If you overstep a ridge which separates two waterslopes, I think you overstep the border of two valleys.

The valley of London would be the valley of the Thames ; but the basin of London is quite another affair, and is no valley at all. The north-east half of the basin of London is out of the valley of the Thames, and the north-west half of the valley of the Thames is out of the basin of London. The basins of London, Baris,* and Hampshire, have no relation whatever to valleys, river-courses, or basins. They only refer to those parts of these neighbourhoods which are still undenuded, and covered with tertiary strata, and these strata pass over hill and dale, and are not, as is usually stated, patches deposited in hollows. The origin of this opinion is twofold. First, some author has dubbed these tertiary regions basins, and his readers have naturally supposed that the basins * The Paris basin runs nearly 200 miles from north to south, and passes over not only the heights which divide the valley of the Seine from the valley of the Loire, but it passes and includes the Loire and the country south of Orleans, even as far as Sancerre, so that the Seine and the Loire traverse the same basin, one to Havre the other to Nantes. But because tertiary strata must be deposited in ' depressions of the chalk,' gentlemen of the closet join together these two dis tinct and magnificent river valleys and call them one basin."], [219, "193 Ch.

Second, tertiary strata being frequently of soft material, are easily denuded from ridges and declivities, and remain only on those heights which are flat-topped, or table-land. The hollows formed in the original igneous ele vation of land above the sea are infinite and innumerable. But they are not valleys. Water instantly occupies them, and turns them into seas or lakes, or fills them with drift and alluvium, or transforms them into valleys. That is, the mo ment any part of the bed of the sea is raised, rain shapes it into ridge and furrow. If England and Ireland were raised so as to lay dry the part of the sea between them, this hollow could not be claimed as formed by running water. But though running water had not formed the one hollow, it would immediately transform it into two valleys. From some middle part the waters would flow in opposite directions to the sea. They would instantly fill all minor hollows with water, and gradually with drift and alluvium, at the same time wearing down the sides of the hollows next the sea, and would continue for ever to deepen these two valleys from the sea upwards.

For as long as the sea acts on the foot of a cliff it remains a precipice ; because the undermining water acts more rapidly than disin- tegration and ivash, and clears away all that falls. Abstract this power, even by the accidental accu- mulation of a bank of travelling shingle, and the cliff has a tendency to conform to the slope of the hill above it, that is, to the ivash of the hill above it, both at the brow of the cliff and at its foot. For what is washed down the hill and off its brow * Keith Johnston talks of ' the plain of the Mississippi- Mackenzie.' He might as well talk of the plain of the Rhine- Danube, the centre of which plain would be the. plain of the Alps. This would be childish enough, but in the case of the Mississippi and Mackenzie the vast valley of the Sascatchewan containing 360,000 square miles runs between them, from the Rocky Mountains to Hudson's Bay, at right angles to the so called 'plain ofthe Mississippi-Mackenzie.'"], [221, "Ch. XIII.] WATER TRANSFORMS THEM. 195 will lie at the foot of the cliff as a shelving bank, and what was the mid-cliff gradually becomes the sole cliff. But this will eventually disappear into one slope. If the top of the cliff is table land, or slopes from the cliff, the cliff will waste much more slowly by disintegration and the action of the elements. But supposing such a cliff to be all of the same material, I think the brow has a ten dency to disappear most quickly, possibly from a freer access and action of rain-water in disin tegration, and possibly also from roots inserting themselves in crevices, and by turgescence de taching blocks bodily. Besides this, roots in decay generate carbonic acid, which is a great disin tegrator. Another reason may be that the wash from above, which erodes and degrades the brow, is shot clear of lower parts, as in the case of a waterfall. In addition to this, the entire surface of these former cliffs and present hill-sides would be laid in ridge and furrow. They would be grooved throughout by rain with small incipient valleys. And if it may be said that the apexes and ridges of mountains are not formed by rain, I answer that they are at least transformed by rain. That is, their surface is formed by rain.

In regard to ' vertebrated animals, the most ancient of these are, as we have already seen, fishes ; next in the order of succession of formation, passing from the lower to the upper, come reptiles and mammalia.' After enumerating the strata from the most ancient to the most recent tertiary beds, he says, ' then follow in the alluvial beds the colossal bones of the mammalia of the primitive world.' In the summary he alludes to the ' colossal bones of antediluvial mammalia in the upper alluvium ;' and later he alludes to ' the sudden destruction of so great a number of colossal vertebrata in the diluvial period.' Would he have us believe that there was no room for them in the ark ? No admit tance for Theria or Sauria beginning with Mega or Macro ? But though I accept this universal opinion of geologists as a testimony to the everlasting wash of the land into the sea, I cannot think that a perfect history of all the organisations which have existed would result, even if we could see every fossil which the earth contains.

It is only natural that in strata formed in the sea, the fossils in general should be of fish or of sea animals and plants, and that fresh-water or land animals or plants should be a most rare exception. So in fresh-water strata amphibious animals and fresh-water productions prevail ; and in beds of drift and alluvium, or ' sediment de posited on dry land,' land animals and plants. Where are the fossil remains of land quadrupeds found ? In cavern deposits, in drift and allu viums ' deposited on dry land,' in filled- up lakes, in bogs, or frozen up in polar regions. Now all these land museums are not only modern, but they are superficial and temporary. They are liable to be washed into the sea ; and their fossil con tents must be destroyed before they can be re deposited in marine strata. We have no museums for the collection of really ancient land existences. Marine strata are the museums for the collection of really ancient life ; but their collections are very imperfect, ex cept of those beings which wear their skeletons outside them.

Yet both these impossi bilities not only go on every day but all day long ; and we see the water in the air as clouds, and the land in the water as muddy water. But it is only as muddy water that land goes out to sea, or as the finest sand. It is only as muddy water that the new emigrant continent takes passage to its destination. All the coarser material brought by floods to the shore remains there till the waves have ground it fine enough for carriage. 'And the waves they are never weary.'

Or an animal may be floated out on a tree, or on an iceberg, and if not devoured may become fossil. I need not go farther to show the impossibility that nature should write us a perfect catalogue of foregone land animals, from such scanty materials, even if the archives which she has written were accessible to us. With regard to land plants it is otherwise. They might all float out to sea for great distances ; that is, till they are water-logged, till water has replaced the air which they contain. To this provision we owe our coal-beds ; and I think it somewhat puzzling that coal should be confined to the Baleozoic strata. On the west coast of Africa, immediately to the north of the equator, the Niger discharges from the mouths of its delta vast quantities of drift wood. Imme diately to the south of the equator the Congou does the same. And I have been told by mer chants, and by officers serving on that coast, that islands of wood with trees growing on them float out to sea from both these rivers. The admirable Bennel has chalked out for us the course of the current which must convey this drift vegetation across the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico. We have all heard of the vast rafts formed in the Mississippi from the accumulation of drift timber. We have all heard of the enormous quantities of"], [228, "202 [Ch. XIV. MAN MAY HAVE EXISTED Drift and alluvium, or 'deposit on dry land.' drift wood discharged from the mouths of the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the tropical rivers of the north part of South America. What becomes of these vast magazines of carbon till they are so water-logged as to sink ? Brobably, as Lyell remarks, a large proportion takes passage by the Gulf Stream. And not improbably, vast beds of future coal may now be depositing in high northern latitudes, the greatest part of which may be com posed of tropical plants. The tropics of the old world, as well as the new, are most probably at this moment storing their superabundant vegetation for the future warming of our northern descend ants. If this is true, coal may be found in any stratum foregone or to come. Lyell heads a paragraph with ' No sediment on dry land,' ' Brinciples,' chap. xiii. What, then, is the entire deposit of all alluvial plains ? and of that part of all deltas which is above the level of the sea ? Bivers may flow through alluvial plains for a continuous distance of hundreds, nay thou sands, of miles from the sea, the whole of which alluvium has travelled there as muddy water. That is, every particle of the nearly flat surface has been held in suspension by the flooded rivers and deposited by them ' on dry land.' I should also ask, what then is drift?

If so, why are they so full of the fossil remains of land animals ? and how does the submarine theory apply to the drift bed near Behat, hi India, mentioned in the ninth chapter, which, Captain Cautley tells us, was de posited ' within the memory of persons now living ? ' And how does it apply to the bed which covers the ' very ancient subterranean town' there ? Was the present subterranean town formerly a submarine one ? ' In sinking wells in the environs, masses of shingle and boulders have been reached resembling those now in the river channels of the same district (so we see how long the game which is now playing has been going on) under a deposit of thirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed the excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has gradually raised the whole country skirting the base of the lower hills' As these are quotations from Ly ell's own ' Brinciples,' may I not again ask, in his own words, if ' a false theory does not render him blind to facts which are opposed to his prepos sessions, or conceal from him their true import when he beholds them ?'

But the beds of drift, in general, are of enormous extent, and are not confined only to the alluvial neighbourhood of rivers and their estuaries, or even to low lands, but are found on very high lands provided they have higher land, or have had higher lands in their neighbourhood. High steep places waste comparatively rapidly on to lower and less steep places. Low flat places waste comparatively slowly into the sea. But, except on the brow of a hill, when a geologist states the arrangement of the beds of any district, the following is almost invariably his exordium : \u2014 1. Vegetable mould. 2.

The same may be said of the rich soil of our valleys, though the change here is infinitely more gradual. Infinitely more gradual still is the change of our drift beds. Indeed, in some places their denudation would re quire a time which, compared with the existence of any species of animal, might be called an eternity.

And though these beds are considered geologi cally new, and indeed some of them were formed yesterday and some are forming to-day, they are not all so new but what the English beds of them contain remains of species long since extinct on earth, as the mastodon or the mammoth, the gigantic mole, and of animals which have long since ceased to inhabit these climes, as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, buffalo, bison, Irish elk, reindeer, tiger, leopard, hy\u00e6na, bear, wild boar, wolf, beaver, monkey, lagonys, &c, besides animals which still do exist here, as the horse, ass, deer, ox, roebuck, otter, badger, fox, the wild cat, goat, &c."], [232, "206 [Ch.

One species is supposed to have been four or five times larger than our largest bird, the ostrich. Dr. Deane, quoted by Mantell, ' Wonders of Geology,' p. 558, says : ' I have in my possession consecutive impressions of tridactyle feet which measure eighteen inches in length by fourteen in breadth, between the ex tremities of the lateral toes. Each footstep will hold half a gallon of water, and the stride is four feet. The original bird must have been four or five times larger than the African ostrich, and therefore could not have weighed less than 600 pounds. Every step the creature took sank deep, and the substrata bent beneath the enormous load. If an ox walk over stiffened clay, he would not sink so deeply as did this tremendous bird.' Mantell adds, ' Mr. Lyell mentions having seen on the banks of the Connecticut river (at Smith's Ferry, near Northampton, eleven miles from Spring field), a space several yards square, where the entire surface of the shale was irregular and jagged, owing to the number of footsteps, not one of which could be traced distinctly, as when a flock of sheep have passed over a muddy marl ; but on withdrawing from this area, the confusion gradually ceased, and the tracks became distinct.

The largest land quadrupeds, nay man himself, might have existed in the Silurian period for aught we know geologically. . Mammalia and man might have existed in the Silurian pe riod/or what we know. I have already mentioned the appearance of land quadrupeds in the Oolitic strata, and their reappearance in the comparatively modern ter tiary beds. Did they vanish from the earth between those periods, or might they not have existed before ? Myriads of species of megathe riums, macrotheriums, dinotheriums, anaplothe riums, or anyothertheriums may have existed before the Silurian or primary and metamorphic period, without a vestige of their fossil remains being found in these strata. Their fossil remains would have been hoarded in the drift and alluvium of the lands from the denudation of which the Silurian and metamorphic beds were formed, and the fossil remains would have been dissolved pari passu with those ancient continents. Denudation and deposit pervade the whole terraqueous globe. That is, the whole surface of the land is perpetually denuded, and the whole bed of the sea perpetually deposited on. Denudation and deposit pervade the whole terra queous globe. But I need not remark that it is impossible that any stratum should be continuous over the globe, But no stra tum can be universal over the globe. r"], [236, "210 MAN MAY HAVE EXISTED [Ch. XIV since those continents could not be deposited on whose denudation furnished the deposit. As three quarters of the surface of the globe are now sea, those three quarters might be subject to deposit now. About the same proportion may always have obtained. That is, we have no reason to suppose but what the globe is now, and ever has been, pretty much the same as when God first created it. But though fossils of land animals are rare in marine strata, we are not totally without the olive branch anywhere. There are unequivocal symp toms of neighbouring dry land in all strata. Even not excepting the chalk, all deposited strata do occasionally contain the remains of land animals, plants, or shells ; or of river animals, plants, or shells ; or they have ripple-marks or footmarks. If this does not prove that the entire masses of these strata were deposited from the subaerial denudation of land which was high above the sea, it at least proves that while these beds were being deposited they were within the reach of high land which was suffering denudation. As all strata have land fossils, all strata have been formed from the debris of land. That is, by subaerial, not submarine de nudation. I have inserted ripplemarks in my list of wit nesses, because they form almost my only claim to the Silurian and crystalline and altered beds. Bipplemarks, however, evidently testify the neigh bourhood of land while the ground on which they"], [237, "Ch. XIV.] 211 IN THE SILURIAN PERIOD. Surface flints the residuum of denudation were imprinted was subject to deposition. Had the ground on which they were formed been rising and subject to denudation, they would have vanished. With regard to the remains of land plants, Lyell ('Brinciples') says of the Silurian beds : ' Hitherto few, if any, contemporaneous vegetable remains have been noticed ; but such as are mentioned agree more nearly with the plants of the carboniferous era than any other, and would therefore imply a warm and humid atmo sphere, entirely free from intense cold throughout the year.' According to Blayfair, ripplemarks are found in the crystalline and altered rocks. In reference to the chalk, it is entirely excep tional. It is a deep-sea deposit, not resulting from any denudation, but formed of the calcareous parts of the remains of fish, corals, zoophytes, and animalcul\u00e6, as its flints are of the siliceous parts of these remains. And I think that this accounts for ' the hiatus which still separates the cretaceous and Eocene periods in Europe.' For it is only natural that the orgauic remains of the deep-sea deposit should differ from those of deposits formed from the detritus of land. In chalk countries denudation leaves a residuum of flints on the surface ; because, though these flints disintegrate, and though each of them is surrounded with a white soft surface of decay, p 2"], [238, "212 [Ck. XIV. MAN MAY HAVE EXISTED they do not decay so fast as the chalk. Notwith standing the most sedulous stonepicking, these flints still make their appearance, and it is the universal opinion among farmers that they grow, not in size, but in numbers. But however we may laugh at the idea of the growth of flints on land, for the fact that surface flints increase in number, it is impossible to suppose more competent wit nesses than farmers ; and how is the fact to be accounted for unless they are the residuum of denudation ? When sheep, in feeding off turnips, have trodden the ground firm and the flints loose, I have seen them raked into rows and shovelled into carts. And were it not that the bulk of the layers of chalk which decay into soil so infinitely exceeds the bulk of the layers of flint which decay into soil, the accumulation of surface flints would soon stop agriculture in chalk districts. But as rain gradually and annually washes away the soil, the plough brings up fresh flints. And this in crease of surface flints in number would prove a very universal denudation going on at this moment under our own eyes. I add this paragraph to the second edition : \u2014 With regard to the forma tion of chalk, we have pretty good evidence that it is now forming on an enormous scale. In the Atlantic, Lieut. Nelson found a deposit from de cayed coral in some lagoons at the Bermudas,"], [239, "Cu. XIV.] 213 IN THE SILURIAN PERIOD. some specimens of which are now in the museum of the Geological Society, and Lyell says that they are only to be distinguished from chalk by their labels. 1st the Bacific, Darwin says that myriads of fish of the genus Sparus feed day and night on the living corals on the outside of the reefs, and that the inside parts of the reefs are perforated in all directions by a certain worm, and that the excrement of the fish and of the worm is not to be distinguished from chalk. Now, as there are many many thousand miles of coral reefs, we need not look farther for the origin of chalk. With regard to the how flint was formed, I think that all the suppositions are the merest and sheerest guesses. But I think that the when and the where are clear as far as this, that flint was formed when the chalk was formed and where the chalk was formed, because flint fills and involves the shell-fish and zoophytes of the chalk sea. I think that it is clear that both the chalk and the flint were formed in the sea, and I should guess that out of the sea (that is, after the chalk was raised) there has been no change whatever in either of them except decay."], [240, "214 [Ch.

Ellet forms the alluvial plain solely forward, in the sea. lations of a character more monstrous than any which have been perpetrated in modern times. But, doubtless, Ellet's opinions are practice, and his neighbour's opinions ' speculations.' This is a very usual and very useful definition of the differ ence between theory and practice. Ellet calls the whole of the alluvial plain the delta. I should restrict the delta to that small part of an alluvial plain from the sea to where the river first breaks into branches to the sea, the two outside of which, with the sea shore, often form a A. I do not, however, fight about a name, nor should I if it was the hardest and longest that Humboldt ever coined. But Ellet makes ' the head of the delta ' and the line of the ancient sea shore the same, and he places these as far north or up the river as Commerce, above the Ohio. I should place the hne of the ancient shore at least as far south as the present shore east and west of New Orleans. Ellet, indeed, deprecates the mooting the question, and designates it as ' an irrelevant geological speculation.' But, as will be seen by the diagram, page 223, Ellet forms his delta solely forward and solely in the sea. And according to him and his diagram, it is only the sea-formed delta which rises. From the sea shore upward or backward, the level of the land formed alluvial plain has been stationary for"], [242, "216 [Ch. XV. ELLET ON The beds of rivers and valleys are formed chiefly backward, or up the valley. 45,000 years ! It is therefore of vital importance even to Ellet's extraordinary theory, to know which part of the plain is sea formed, and which is land-formed, that is, where the ancient sea shore ran. I shall refer to this question hereafter, and shall here endeavour to show that all alluvial plains, including their deltas, increase and rise every year everywhere, backward up the valleys, as well as forward in the sea, at the ends of the deltas. Bain, or a river, works at the whole length of the valley or river course at the same time. But the chief formation is backward, that is from the sea to the hill. For, as the beds of rivers, if not horizontal, slope doicn to the sea, it is evident that the cutting down of the parts farthest from the sea must depend on the cutting down of the parts nearest the sea ; that is, the parts farthest from the sea cannot be cut lower than the parts next the sea. So far the cutting of the parts farthest from the sea is dependent on the cutting of the parts next the sea. So that the chief longitudinal cutting of a valley or river-bed may be said to proceed from below upward as regards the valley, or backward as regards the stream of the river ; that- is, it proceeds from the sea to the hill, not from the hill to the sea. No one will doubt that the Niagara gorge is"], [243, "217 Ch. XV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. Rivers may have patches of alluvial plain any- where. cut backward; but take the case of a barrier without a lake behind it. Suppose a barrier of rock to run across any valley or river-bed ; when the bed of the valley or river on the upper side of the barrier has been worn down to a horizontal level with this barrier, it can not go lower. The barrier is in this particular case what the sea is in all cases, a negative key to the level of the valley. Thus deep shalt thou go and no deeper. A river-bed cannot run down before it comes to the barrier and then up again over the barrier. But as the barrier is cut through, the bed of the valley or river will be deepened backward, or from below upward, or towards the hills. This principle is true of the filling in of valleys as well as of the scooping them out. For when the scooping out or deepening is stopped at the lower end by the sea or a barrier of rock, denudation of the inclined parts above still goes on, and makes that lower part horizontal. And the passage of the detritus and soil from the inclined upper parts of valleys is checked in the horizontal lower parts of valleys, and soil accumulates there. This is the origin of alluvial plains ; and a river of any size, or any rapidity, may, at any distance from the sea, have patches of alluvial plain, where no lakes have ever been ; that is, above every rapid or accidental barrier of hard ground. For as the"], [244, "218 ELLET ON [Ch. XV. and these patches pro gress back ward, or up the valley. barrier ponds the flood- water back on the hori zontal valley above it, deposit will take place, that deposit will increase the ponding back up the valley, and, as long as overflow takes place, these patches will rise and progress backward up the valley. The only difference in the laws for the growth and gradient of these patches from those which regulate the growth and gradient of the plain at the level of the sea, is that they have no increasing cause for rising equivalent to the for ward lengthening of the delta of the lower alluvial plain. These flat alluvial patches may be seen even in torrents, sometimes reaching from one cascade to the other ; and though each cascade digs a hole deep in proportion to the height of the cascade, as the cascade recedes, that part of the hole or rather groove which is farthest from the cascade is filled with debris. It is easy to perceive that these patches must be liable to constant change. They must be perpetually shortened by the re- cession of the lower barrier, and lengthened by the recession of the upper one : also that the wearing down of a barrier or shallow from below will expose the alluvial patch above it to denudation ; while the rise of an alluvial patch from below, over a rapid above it, may join two alluvial patches in one. These principles are eternally"], [245, "219 Ch. XV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. at work on all valleys, from the smallest to the largest. With regard to the lower alluvial plain, the last yard protruded at the level of the sea, by preventing the flood-water spreading in the sea, that is, by ponding the water back, forces it over the yard behind it, and raises that yard above the level of the sea ; and so every yard raises the yard behind it backward in succession not only to the highest point of the alluvial plain, but above it ; that is, from the end of the delta at the sea, the river buflds its alluvial plain at a certain gradient (say that given by Ellet, eight inches in a mile), and its banks, say at a gradient of three inches in a mile,* till these gradients strike the unalluvial bed, which it progresses up ; and whether the whole river is artificially embanked, or whether it has patches embanked, in either case, the banks must eternally be raised with the eternal rising of this natural gradient. Thus it is that a river is enabled to build itself a channel of indefinite length out to sea (the Ganges runs 220 mdes out to sea), the sides of which channel shall not only confine for three parts of the year, the waters which built them, but these banks shall rise high above the level of * The difference is owing to the winding of the banks through the plain."], [246, "220 [Ch.

All this appears impossible : yet every day, in every quarter of the globe, these impossibilities are being performed. The height of banks thus built above the spring-water, is simply the difference between the level of the flood-water and spring-water. The difference between the level of the flood-water and spring-water at the sea is nothing. Therefore the banks che off to nothing at the sea. And one would suppose that there must be a fixed rule for the height of alluvial banks, according to the distance from the sea. In other words, that there must be a fixed rule for the increased rise of the flood-water necessary to overflow alluvial banks, directly as their increased distance from the sea. Though possibly this would chiefly depend on the quantity and suddenness of the floods to which each individual river is subject. I have seen somewhere, I think in Herodotus, the planetary number 7 applied to the Nile, in the supposition that at Mendes it required a rise of 7 cubits to overflow the banks, at Memphis 14, and at Syene 28.

This determination of valleys to begin at the end, and to go on backwards, is, as has been said, the cause why they are generally widest at the end next the sea. Because the longitudinal cut ting being there first made, the sides will be there first exposed to disintegration and the lateral wash of rain. So that, other circumstances the same, valleys widen as they descend. But directly as the comparative hardness of the sides of any part of a valley will be the comparative narrowness of that part. Ellet has left the main natural difficulty out of the calculation. That is, he has blinked the growth of the alluvial plain backward up the valley, on the land. To suit his mode of forming the delta only forward, and only in the sea, he introduces the sea (and a deep sea too) 500 miles into the Continent of America, up ' to the village * As a loose approximation to a general rule, may it be said that the slope towards the sea of the banks of an alluvial river is between two and three inches in a mile, and that the slope of the flood- water is the same ?

' It is not an unreasonable sup position that, at periods anterior to the commence ment of the deposit, the bed of the gulf sloped up uniformly from its present depth (' more than 1000 feet ') near Belize to the shores then found above the mouth of the Ohio.' Here he tumbles the Mississippi over a cataract at 'the point at which rock in situ is first en countered on both sides of its channel, and sup posed to be found in its bed.' The cataract has ' a fall of 285 feet at low water, or nearly double the actual perpendicular descent of the falls of Niagara.' And the same rock still remains ' in situ ' in the channel of the river over which this cascade rolled for 45,000 years, while it formed the delta. And the wear and tear, not only of the floods of the river, for this space of time, but the passage of the material of the entire alluvial plain, have neither lowered the rock a hair's breadth, or caused its face to retreat an inch up the valley. Indeed, so far from any erosion being formed by this cataract, a curiously strong deposit, a sort of cascade of deposits, instantly begins from it. It builds up from the bottom of a sea, perhaps 300 feet deep, an alluvial deposit to the top of the cataract, nearly 300 feet high.

If alluvial plains were formed according to this diagram, solely down stream, or forward in the sea, from the sea shore backward on the land, the river once embanked would be always embanked, and there would be no difficulty about it. But nothing in nature ever happened like this diagram. The left end of the line of deposits never got up to H before the right end arrived at D. Ellet has only allowed for his house being on fire at one end, whereas it is on fire at both ends. He has only raised and lengthened the line of new deposits to the right, or forward into the sea, whereas nature raises it, and lengthens it to the left also, or backward up the valley.

Though artificial embankments will stop this rise of deposits altogether, and even expose them to denudation, the eternal causes of the rise of deposits will be at work on the rise of the surface of the river, and of its bed, and conse quently on the necessary rise of the artificial em bankment for ever. And as long as man can play this game, the plain, instead of rising every year from overflow and deposit, will sink every year from denudation, while the surface of the river and its bed will rise every year. The filling in of valleys is, as has been said, on the same principle as that which governs their scooping out. That is, it proceeds chiefly from the sea towards the hill. And the chief growth of alluvial plains in extent of area is backward or up stream on the land, not forward in the sea. That is, it is simply from the ponding back and overflow of water, which must happen where valleys which have been worn horizontal, or nearly horizontal, receive the flood-water from the inclined channels of unalluvial rivers. Commerce is nearly 300 feet above the level of the sea. The direct distance to the sea is about 500 miles. The slope of the Q"], [252, "226 ELLET ON [Ch. XV. land is about eight inches in the mile. By the river, the distance is about 1200 miles, the slope of the banks is about three inches in the mile. Cut off the lower 250 miles of alluvial plain, or introduce a deep estuary that distance, there would be a fall of the river into the estuary of nearly 150 feet. This would soon cut a deep channel through the soft alluvial deposits, back ward to Commerce, and the river could not over flow and deposit on its banks. Clap on the lower 250 miles of deposits again, and it will overflow and deposit on its banks. Why ? because the lower 250 miles of deposits pond the river back on the upper 250 miles of deposits. Artificial banks prevent this rising of the plain, that is, of the natural banks. While, by increas ing the rise of the delta in the sea, they increase the ponding back, or rising of the surface of the river and of its bed. Art, therefore, is not only perpetually fighting against itself, but perpetually increasing its powers against itself ; that is, in the case of the Mississippi, the deposit which nature would annually spread over the surface of 40,000 square miles to raise the land against the water, art annually sends to the end of the delta to increase the rising of the water against the land, while at the same time it exposes that land to denudation."], [253, "Ch. XV.] 227 THE MISSISSIPPI. Principle of the longitu dinal and lateral slopes of alluvial plains. There are two slopes in perpetual formation in alluvial plains. The degree of the longitudinal slope (eight inches per mile) is the result of the annual ponding back of flood-water. The degree of the lateral slope (say 40 inches per mile) results from the dying off of deposits from moving water. The longitudinal slope is so slight that to almost all practical intents it may be left out of calcula tion. But the effect of this slight difference between principle and practice, in such a basin as the Mississippi, may expose millions of men to the constant chance of death to themselves and des truction to their property from inundation, with the certainty that their actual estates are in process of becoming subterranean and themselves and their works fossil. For let the Bo fill the Adriatic at a dead level, what signifies it to Ferrara ? but give a slope of eight inches in the mile from Otranto towards the Alps, and Ferrara is subterranean. When the Mississippi first began to cut its channel to the sea, which was when the land had just risen from the sea, there was no indenture in the sweep of the shore of the gulf, nor did that shore reach up to above the Ohio, as Ellet has supposed. On the contrary, the shores of the gulf (I do not allude to the delta) extended then much farther into the sea than they do now, and they have been worn back by the sea. But the Q 2"], [254, "228 ELLET ON [Ch. XV. line even of the present sea shore would cross the delta about New Orleans. And the very least that can be abstracted from Ellet's ancient sea is the distance between New Orleans and Commerce. This question is, as I have said, of importance, because, according to Ellet's theory and diagram, the level of the plain at the sea shore, and from thence upwards, is stationary, and it is only in the sea that the delta rises. And the rise of nearly 300 feet from New Orleans to Commerce is, according to Ellet, exceptional, as regards the plain above it, because it was raised in the sea. Where as, in fact, it was raised on the land, by the same causes which are now raising it and all the alluvial parts above it. The only part of the delta formed in the sea is from New Orleans to the point D, in the diagram. The young river made an indenture in the sweep of the shores ; the mature river filled it in. The young river made an indenture as its estuary, or negative delta, as it is called, which must always precede a positive delta. For, as has been repeated too often, the direct operation of a river is only to cut down a deep channel for itself, till that cutting down is stopped by the sea. But since this estuary was cut, rain has formed the entire valley of the Mississippi, and the river has rolled the former contents of this valley into the"], [255, "Ch. XV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. 229 sea. There is no wonder then at the largeness of the delta ; the wonder is that it is so small. It is perhaps a millionth part of what has gone into the sea. And the other 999,999 parts are now forming tertiary (or quartiary) strata, to support our descendants a million years hence. But small as the delta is, it is a pretty good lump of earth. And where does it come from, unless from the formation of the valley ? But the operation has not ceased. On the contrary, it increases in vigour ; and the river is not only now daily in creasing the growth of the delta and the alluvial plain, by deposit from the denudation of the whole of its tributary ground, but the greater the future growth of this tributary ground, that is, of the unalluvial valley in length and in width, the greater will be the supply, not only of water, but of alluvium, and consequently the greater will be the growth of the delta forward into the sea, and of the alluvial plain backward up the valley. If, according to Ellet's theory and diagram, the level ofthe plain upward from the sea shore, which he puts at Commerce, but which actually was at New Orleans, has remained the same for 45,000 years, it may remain the same for the next 45,000 years. This is a very comfortable doctrine, be cause, in this case, the river once embanked is always embanked. But in fact, as has been stated,"], [256, "230 ELLET ON [Ch. XV. the level of a valley is never permanent in any part, and there is no part of the valley of the Mississippi subject to flood which is not raised by deposit every year, nor any part of the whole valley not subject to flood, or where flood is banked out, which is not lowered every year by denudation. ' Bock in situ' in the channel of a river is no proof in general that the sea reached up to it. The river may have cut any quantity of rocky strata down to below the level of its present bed between Commerce and the Gulf, and afterwards have covered them deep under the alluvial plain, as it may hereafter the particular rock at Com merce, or any successive strata of rocks higher up the river. And the Mississippi is now, and for ever will be, going on backwards up the valley, wearing down rapids and pushing up the alluvial plain, and patches of alluvial plain. And as to the particular rock at Commerce, the river has evidently cut it down to its present level, out of the chain ' where the rocky hills approach the shore on both sides.' And Ellet's cascade would have originally fallen from the top of these ' rocky hills' into his sea, if it had existed. Whether the river cut its passage through these ' rocky hills' by ponding, that is, by forming a lake behind them, like the St. Lawrence at"], [257, "Ch. XV.] THE MISSISSIPPI. 231 Niagara, or without ponding, as the Weald rivers have through the North and South Downs, is pro bably now not to, be guessed at. But the reason that these ' rocky lulls' still ' approach the shore on both sides ' is simply their hardness in com parison with the sides of the valley, above and below. They have yielded less quickly to disin tegration and the wash of rain, and therefore project from the sides of the valley, from the same cause as the volcanic dikes do from the sides of the Val del Bove. If left to nature, the river might continue to erode its rocky bed at Commerce, and while this erosion was going on the alluvial plain might rise, and with it the bed of the river, and, passing clear over the rock, they might carry their uniform gradients up the valley for hundreds of miles. The first rock ' in situ ' above Commerce would then, according to Ellet, mark where the delta began and the sea ended. Any stratum of rock which formed a barrier across the valley 1000 miles above Commerce might occasion a detached patch of alluvial plain above it. Below this barrier the river might run for 100 miles over rapids, and as the river wore this bed of rocks down, and the alluvial plain progressed up the valley, this patch of alluvial plain might be joined to the lower plain, and"], [258, "232 ELLET ON C h. X V. The bed of the river rises with the alluvial plain. so become the beginning of what Ellet calls the delta. Ellet contends against ' the popular belief that the river raises its bed. He is constrained, how ever, to allow that it has done so, through the 500 miles of his own particular sea-formed delta. If it had not raised its bed between Commerce and Belize, the bed of the river now would be the same as the bed of Ellet's ancient sea ; just inside the mouth of the river there should be more than 1000 feet of water where there are now 100. And though the bed would ' slope up uniformly ' to ' above the mouth of the Ohio,' we should then add 300 feet to the depth of the river, namely, the depth of the old cataract from ' the rock in situ.' Ellet, however, gives the depth of the river there as about seventy feet. Its bed then must be upwards of 200 feet above the surface of Ellet's supposed sea, since its surface was nearly 300 feet below the rock in situ. But this, according to Ellet, is only ' a has been ; * it is exceptional, because this part of the alluvial valley was formed in the sea, which it was not. The bed of the river no longer rises ; there fore the river once embanked is always embanked. This is a frightful mistake. The causes which scooped the valley of the Mississippi out and also filled it in, are still producing both these effects"], [259, "Ch. XV.] 233 THE MISSISSIPPI. Why alluvial rivers receive tributaries without in- crease of width. now as actively, nay, more actively, than ever. And as long as the river floods, and wherever it floods, it will deposit and raise its banks, and with them its bed. Even the present beds of the mouths of the delta will hereafter be raised as the delta progresses out to sea. As long as the end of the delta remains stationary the depth of the mouths must be stationary to this extent, there must be sufficient depth to let the water into the sea. But as the delta progresses forward into the sea the beds of the present mouths may rise, as the whole bed behind them does rise now, and may rise till the alluvial plain reaches the foot of the Bocky Mountains. Ellet notices, as an anomaly and a peculiarity of the Mississippi, that it receives vast tributaries without an apparent increase of width. But can that be called an anomaly which is a law in all alluvial plains ? The cause I have endeavoured to explain in the second edition of the ' Tree lifter.' Not only are the beds in unalluvial parts inclined, but the land inclines towards the banks. As floods then cannot overflow, they must tear the banks down till they can contain the largest possible flood of the river and each tributary ; and the channels of unalluvial rivers always are adapted to the flood-water, and unduly large for their spring-water. But floods in alluvial rivers,"], [260, "234 [Ch. XV. ELLET ON Cause of the shape of deltas. instead of tearing down, build up the banks, and although they cannot build higher than themselves, each year's building increases next year's ponding, and so, without scaffolding, they may build infi nitely higher than the floods of former years ; and this yearly increasing ponding not only raises the deposits on the alluvial plain, but up the unalluvial plain. The banks of an alluvial river being then high enough to accommodate the flood-water till it only just overflows, it is evident that the spring-water of each tributary, though it will increase the volume, will not increase the width of an alluvial river. The flood- water of tributaries is not contained at all, but overflows, and so in creases the building of the height of the banks. If man prevents the overflow of an alluvial river, he must consider it as an unalluvial river. He cannot, indeed, increase the width between the natural banks, but he may the width between the artificial banks. There seems to be a reason in nature for the shape (A) of all deltas. For the centre stream or streams, however they may vary their courses, besides causing the delta to bow out in the middle towards the sea, also cause it to bow up in the middle, along their courses. For all deposits from moving water must die off in the direction in which the water moves. And in this case the"], [261, "Ch. XV.] 235 THE MISSISSIPPI. deposits have a lateral slope from the river five or six times as great as their longitudinal slope, from ponding. Thus the water does not return over the general surface traversed, as it left the river, and so denude the banks which it has deposited. In the alluvial plain the flood-water returns to the river by particular longitudinal channels parallel to the river, which it reenters below, or by par ticular lateral channels cut down to the level of the spring-water. But in the delta the flood- water after depositing its load, escapes to the nearest points of the sea, along the two low outsides of the delta. In the last century a French nobleman made a bet that he would get an English horse to do twenty miles in one hour. The savans in Baris clearly proved that this was impossible, on account of the resistance of the atmosphere. Gimcrack was, however, imported to France from England. And Dr. Johnson, in giving an account of the affair, concludes thus, ' Gimcrack, being no philo sopher, set to work and did it.' Dii facientes adjuvant, the English for which is 'try.'

But since those who have there enjoyed exquisite existences are numbered by thousands of millions, would any one advocate the desertion by man of the delta of the Bhine ?
