In entering on the investigation of a subject so interesting as that which occupies the fol- lowing pages, it would be useless to detain the reader on the threshold of inquiry ; for a good book seldom requires, and a worthless one never deserves a long preface. It may not, however, be amiss to premise, that in attempt- ing to exhibit, in a luminous point of view, the causes which, in all ages, have influenced the state of nations, and produced their cha- racteristic discriminations, the principles ad vanced by various aurhors, who have directly or indirectly treated these subjects, are here brought forward to distinct inspection. The materials which serve as the basis of this in- quiry, are furnished by all that is known of human nature and social life. But the opinions"], [10, "PREFACE. IV and assertions of historians, travellers, and political writers, being dispered through nu merous volumes, and often so much obscured by contradictions, that, without a critical ex amination, it is impossible to deduce from them any satisfactory conclusion, it is requisite to collect the scattered rays of light into a focus, in order to illumine one of the most interesting subjects of moral inquiry, \u2014 the nature and origin of those circumstances which occasion the diversity that is seen in the modifications of the human mind and the forms of national existence. The eternal laws which determine the intel lectual and social state of the different portions of the human species, have their existence in certain physical and moral causes, which, by their combinations or mutual counteraction, form the character and fix the destiny of nations. The operations of these causes I have endeavoured to investigate, by ex amining the nature of man, and to illustrate by examples from ancient and modern history. The investigation of a subject so complex, might, indeed, have been extended to a much greater length ; but I have endeavoured to"], [11, "PREFACE. V exhibit the whole series of argument and illus- tration in the most condensed form ; and instead of each train of reasoning being pur- sued to its last ramifications, something is left for the intellectual exercise of the reader, as the general principles which are advanced, will admit of an almost unlimited extent and variety of application. A comparison of the ancients and moderns will not be deemed an inappropriate conclusion to a work of tins nature ; and although the contrast is exhibited in a point of view very different from that in which it has been sometimes contemplated, judicious criticism will scarcely condemn the result of the discussion. On the whole it is presumed, that these considerations, on subjects so interesting, will not be found uniustructive or unentertaining to those who possess a taste for inquiry into the history of nations and of the human mind."], [12, "VI INTRODUCTION. \u2014*>s><\u00ab\u00ab- In taking an extensive view of the human species in every period of its existence, we see its moral and intellectual form exhibiting, in different nations, communities, and profes sions, a distinctive appearance. This mental difference is not unfrequently accompanied by differences of physical qualities, which seem to distinguish particular races of men. A slight acquaintance with history, ancient and mo dern, suffices to shew that, in every age, from remote antiquity to the present day, some nations have far excelled others in courage, in bodily and mental vigour, in moral conduct, and intellectual attainments : and the aggre gate of those qualities that appear to prepon derate in different communities, is designated by the name of national character. As all men, in all nations, are of the same species, are"], [13, "INTRODUCTION. VII endowed with the same senses and feelings, and receive their perceptions and ideas through similar organs, the difference, whether physi cal or moral, that is observed in comparing different races or assemblages of men, can arise only from external and adventitious cir cumstances. The same observation is applica ble to individuals ; although the causes that in fluence their conduct are often so various and also so recondite as to render it impossible to make a just estimate of their operation. But the mode of thinking and acting pursued by bodies of men, is ever in conformity with general rules, capable of being reduced to a common standard, and assigned to definable causes. Egregious errors are common in descriptions and estimates of national character. Its dif ferent colouring arises from causes of a general nature, originating from a particular state of society, aud is totally distinct from any thing that proceeds from the passions or circum stances of individuals. In every age and country, the general principles of human nature are the same ; and the diversified modes of human conduct, in the auairs of private"], [14, "VIII INTRODUCTION. Jife, may be rather ascribed to individual than national circumstances. The different indivi- duals of each country, therefore, display all the diversity of character that can be imagined ; and in every nation, brave men and cowards, wise men and fools, may be found. But the vague assertions of inconsiderate writers, and the credulity of ignorant readers have concur- red to produce and to propagate an erroneous i notion, that every individual has so strong a tinge of the character of the nation to which he belongs, as to be distinguishable from per- sons of a different country ; and what has been once said, has, for that very reason, been a thousand times repeated. According to these superficial observations of human nature, every Frenchman must be polite, but loqua- cious and volatile, every German intemperate, every Dutchman avaricious, every Spaniard grave, sullen, and haughty ; and to these might be added a long \" Et c\u0153tera,\" of similar as- sertions, calculated to impose on the ignorant and to impress on the inexperienced mind erroneous ideas. So many foolish things, indeed, have been said, and so many sophisms repeated in regard to this subject, that a mul-"], [15, "IX INTRODUCTION. titudinous mass of observations and opinions must be examined, before a right judgment can be formed. We have been taught to view the character of the ancient Romans, and that of the modern Italians, in a light very unfavourable to the latter, and, in some respects, not without reason, especially if we confine our retrospect to the first ages of the republic. Even in their state of corruption and degeneracy, the superiority of their tactics kept up, for a long time, the military reputation of the Romans ; but all that could render them illustrious was confined to their armies, and they were more completely enslaved under the emperors than they have ever been under the popes. We cannot peruse the annals of Tacitus without perceiving, in almost every page, that no people were ever more degenerate than the Romans had become at so early a period as the reign of Tiberius. That emperor, in going to the senate house, was heard to say, \" Devoted men how they rush headlong into i bondage.\"* Tacitus, in depicting those times, * Tacit. Anna!, lib. 3. cap. 63,"], [16, "X INTRODUCTION. says, that \" At Rome, all things tended to st state of abject servitude, consuls, senators, and Roman knights, contended, with emula t tion, who should be the most willing slaves. The higher each person's rank, the more he struggled for the foremost place in bondage.3'* Neither modern Italy nor any other country has ever exhibited a more disgusting picture. Some writers affect to treat with contempt the character of thf modern Italians as unwar like and pusilanimous. But their division into a number of petty states, without any center of union, is the principal circumstance that prevents them from making a conspicuous figure on the military theatre : as individuals they have shewn themselves not inferior to any Other people in the qualities requisite for a martial life. In the Belgic wars, the Italian regiments were ranked amongst the best troops that composed the armies of Don John, of Austria, and Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma. And at the memorable naval action pf Eepanto, the Roman gallies, which led the van of the confederate fleet, displayed an en terprising intrepidity that would have done * Tacit.

National character is not to be estimated from isolated facts or temporary ebullitions. In England, the character of the French has generally been regarded as volatile and un- steady ; but it must be remembered, that the English nation changed its religion four times in the space of twenty-one- years, a circum- stance which has no parallel in the history of France, or of any other country in the world. The great rebellion in the reign of Charles I. and the execution of that unfortunate monarch, impressed foreigners with a very unfavourable opinion of the character of the English nation. And the French, who not many years before the revolution, boasted with pride of their loyalty, used to call the English an unsteadv and fickle people, whom no king could govern, and no religion could phase. But how readily the French assumed the character which they had marked with so much reprobation and ridicule, and rushed into rebellion, atheism, and anarchy, while the English exhibited themselves the patrons and supporters of loyalty, religion, and social order ! !"], [18, "XII INTRODUCTION. An observing and judicious traveller has remarked the fallacy of those notions relating to national character, which have long been current amongst the vulgar, who assert with- out proof, and believe without examination. \" The observations 1 have made,\" says Kuittner, \" in the countries through which I have tra- velled, in general contradict the characters of those nations commonly ascribed to them in books and conversation. Thus, for example, in the Spaniards, with whom I have been ac- quainted, 1 never could find the gravity and stiffness by which that nation is generally supposed to be distinguished. In the French- man I have seldom discovered that winning amiableness of disposition, and the high degree of politeness and delicacy inseparable from it, which are universally ascribed to him. I never observed that, in his own country, the Englishman was that melancholy, reserved, and gloomy being for which he is proverbial. The German is by no means the drunkard or she clownish uncivilized brute, that in many countries he is described to be. Am I to sup pose that all the individuals with whom I was acquainted, were exceptions, and that the"], [19, "INTRODUCTION. XIII observations of so many years were false? or may it not rather be asserted, that the charac ters of whole nations, as delineated in early works, from 'which they have got into every ones mouth, are incorrect ? It is much easier to collect ideas of men and things from books than from real life ; and it is inconceivable how notions once adopted, continue to be propagated for successive ages.\"* Similar observations are made by Mr. A. Young, in speaking of the taciturnity of the French at their \" Tables d' hotel's \" I came,'' says he, \" to this kingdom, expecting to have my ears constantly fatigued with the infinite volubility and spirits of the people, of which so mam persons have written, sitting, 1 suppose, at their English firesides.5'! Nothing can be more just than these obser vations, to which might be adduced many others of a similar nature and tendency. And after all that can be said of the loquacity of Frenchmen, it is questionable whether in this as well as in volubility of speech, they are not \u00bb Kuittner'sTrav. Phil.

Those who have seen their popular amusements in their towns, and especially among the peasantry, will not regard them as a people of a sullen, reserved, or gloomy character ; and no one who has been a spectator of their animated dances, the Fandango and the Volero, will ever accuse them of a want of vivacity. Dismissing the trite and groundless asser tions which have been so long re-echoed by ignorant or prejudiced writers, and adopted without examination by credulous readers, we must be on our guard against all the farrago of misrepresentation produced by prejudice * To those who happen to hear Frenchmen, or, indeed, any other foreigners converse, and do not understand their language, they appear to speak with extraordinary volubility. la regard to the French, this appears to be an effect of the pronunciation of their language, which does not, like the English, allow one fully accented syllable to drown, in a great measure, the sound of the others of which a word is composed. In the French language, almost every syllable being fully pronounced, seems a distinct word to the ear of a foreigner. But from some experiments which I have witnessed in reading an equal quantity of matter in the two languages, I am led to believe that, generally speaking, a Frenchman does not, in a given space of time, utter more words than nn Englishman."], [21, "INTRODUCTION.

While man was in his primeval state, before the species was divided into different communities and nations, distinguished by various laws, languages, and creeds, no difference could be produced in the human character by political systems and religious tenets, which had then no existence.

Dr. Adam Smith has observed, that the nations which first became conspi cuous by their civilization, were those which dwelt round the Mediterranean. And Dr. Johnson, in speaking of the coasts of that sea, made the following remark : \" On these shores,'* said he, \" were the four great empires of the world, \u2014 the Assyrian, the Persian, the Greek, and the Roman. All our religion, almost all our laws, almost all that sets us above savages, has come to us from the shores of the Mediterranean.\" The early civilization of the nations around the Mediterranean, was, undoubtedly, owing to the easy communication which it afforded. Their situation induced them to direct their attention to nautical affairs ; and the facility of intercourse suggested the ideas of commence. A reciprocal exchange of commodities encou raged the cultivation of their soil, and pro moted the invention and diffusion of various arts and conveniences. Colonies from Egypt settled amongst the savage aborigines of Greece, and introduced into that region the rudiments of letters and laws, of social insti-"], [33, "3 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. tutions, and useful sciences. The Greeks made a rapid progress in civilization, and dissemi- nated its comforts and conveniences in the neighbouring countries. Grecian colonies were, in process of time, established in Italy and Sicily, and at Marseilles, in Gaul : they were even extended to the southern, eastern, and northern shores of the Euxine, to Sinope, and Trebisond, and to the coasts of Colchis, and the Taurican Chersonesus. AVhile Greece thus poured her colonies and transfused her arts into the countries on the north of the Mediterranean, the Ph\u0153nicians of Tjre and Sidon carried the same spirit of discovery and commerce along its southern shores, and even beyond the Pillars of Hercules, as far as the island of Britain. Carthage, the future rival of Rome, was founded by a Tyrian colony, and at length eclipstd the splendour of the parent state. Thus the Mediterranean, by affording an easy intercourse to the nations situated around its shores, appears to have been the first, although not the only cause of their early civilization. The nations of mo- dern Europe derive equal benefits from their inland seas. The Baltic, another vast lake or basin, affords the same advantages to the people of the north, as the Mediterranean offers to those of the- south ; and both these inland seas contribute, in no small degree, to A 2"], [34, "4 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. the superiority which Europe has acquired over the other quarters of the globe. When we cast our eyes over the map of the old continent, we cannot but perceive the dis advantages under which both Asia and Africa lie, from the want of such inlets as the Medi terranean and the Baltic seas. Had the inte rior parts of Asia and Africa, instead of the immense wastes of Tartary, which occupy the middle of the former, and the burning sands of Zaara, which overspread the central regions of the latter, been intersected by extensive gulphs, like the Mediterranean and the Baltic, facilitating the intercourse between the nations situated near their shores, not only the physi cal, but also the moral aspect of these vast continents would have been widely different from what it, at present, appears.* Tartary, and the southern parts of Siberia, might, per haps, have equalled Sweden, European Russia, Prussia, and Germany, in arts and arms, in * The Mediterranean lays all the south of Europe, the north of Africa, and the Ottoman dominions in the south-western part of Asia, open to navigation and commerce ; and the Baltic affords the same advantages to Sweden, Prussia, and the western part of Russia. The great rivers, Oder and Vistula, which fall into the Baltic, open a trade into the interior of eastern Germany and Poland. But central Africa is totally destitute of livers, except the Niger, which, losing itself in the swamps of Wangara, can be of little use to navigation and com merce ; and the same remark may be made on the great rivers of Siberia, which, falling into the Frozen Ocean, can open no communi cation with other countries."], [35, "5 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. commerce and wealth ; while central Africa might possibly have exhibited, in countries hitherto untrodden by the foot of any Euro pean, nations as famous as the Greeks and the Romans.* An Athens or a Rome might, in this case, have occupied the site of Tombuctoo and Houssa. Our imagination may conceive a general, and even a just idea of the advantages or disadvantages of different situations ; but their effects cannot be precisely ascer tained by the most minute and accurate cal culation. Although geographical and topographical circumstances may well be supposed to have a very considerable share in giving the first direction to the pursuits of collective bodies of men, the records both of ancient history and modern discovery, contribute to shew, that, in process of time, their influence is often coun- teracted, and sometimes extinguished, by moral causes, and incidents. The favourable situa tion of Great Britain, has greatly contributed lo render her the chief commercial and mari time empire on the face of the globe; but, during several centuries, the kings of the * These are mentioned only as suppositions not wholly improbable ; but their probability, and even their possibility, will be called in question by those who regard the genius of the Greeks as the effect of their beautiful country and agreeable climate, so different from the level and uniform tracts of the Siberian and African deserts, and the extremes of heat and cold that prevail in those regions."], [36, "6 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. Plantagenet race, directing all their views to the preservation or extension of their conti nental dominions, her natural advantages were neglected ; and it was not till the reign of Elizabeth, that her trade and marine began to make a conspicuous figure. But the Romans exhibit the most remarkable instance of a civilized nation neglecting, in every period of its existence, the advantages of a commercial situation. Although Rome was situated with in sixteen miles of the Mediterranean sea, her citizens, during several ages, never directed their attention to nautical or mercantile affairs. This was owing to her political sys tem. War was the chief, and almost the only political concern of the Roman republic : con quest and dominion were its principal objects : the camp and the forum were the only sources of honour and distinction. These considera tions gave to the citizens of Rome a peculiar train of ideas and pursuits: their minds ac quired a determined bias towards the arts of war and eloquence and thej' never once thought of enriching themselves by commer cial speculations, which they regarded as mean and inglorious. The first attempt of the Romans, in the arts of ship-building and na vigation, were made in order to render them subservient to war, during their severe contest with the Carthaginians ; and, in the most"], [37, "7 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. flourishing ages of the republic and the em- pire, Rome was never commercial. Almost the whole trade of the Roman dominions was carried on by provincial merchants ; and the imperial city itself, when in the height of its splendour and luxury, received its supplies through the same medium. Under the papal dominion, causes of a different nature have prevented the Romans from applying to trade. The church has always been considered as the source of honour and wealth ; and ecclesiasti- cal preferment has been the chief object and aim- of enterprising activity. Architecture, painting, and sculpture, have been greatly encouraged by the popes; and, with the finest models of antiquity before their eyes, the modern Romans have excelled in those arts. But, under the papal government, navigation and commerce have not met with the same encouragement; and the peopleof Rome shew little inclination for such pursuits. Thus, the most celebrated, and once the largest and most opulent city of the world, has ever been one of the least commercial. But besides the great features of situation, which, if not strongly counteracted, are calcu lated to produce decided effects, there are other local circumstances of an inferior nature, and a less striking appearance, which have no inconsiderable influence on the state and cha-"], [38, "8 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. raeter of nations. Dr. Smith observes, that of all the countries in which civilization made the most early appearance and the most rapid progress, Egypt seems to have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were improved to any considerable degree, \u2014 a circumstance which he ascribes to the inland navigation of the Nile. This conjecture is far from being improbable. The benefits of in land navigation are too obvious to admit of a doubt, or to require either proof or illustra tion by argument. And it may be presumed, that its advantages would be perceived in an early period of society, as men would natu rally be inclined to practise the navigation of rivers, before they ventured to commit their safety to the turbulent waves of a wide and tempestuous sea. Local circumstances, besides their effects in promoting or retarding commercial inter course, and the progress of civilization, have also a direct influence on the minds and man ners of men. Gloomy and cheerless countries will generally give a corresponding tinge to the character of their inhabitants. In the Highlands of Scotland and the Hebrides or Western Isles, the people have ever been re markable for a gloomy and superstitious cast of mind, arising from the nature and aspect of their country ; of which the prominent"], [39, "9 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. features are lofty mountains, and rocky and lonely recesses, woods overhanging frightful precipices, lakes intersected with castled pro montories, and extensive solitudes of unculti vated and almost untrodden country, inter spersed with nameless ruins, \u2014 scenes resem bling those represented in some of the landscapes of Salvator Rosa.* The impres sions made on the mind in such situations, are those of melancholy seclusion and prime val simplicity. The romantic ideas attached to their ancient traditions, and the tales that relate the exploits of their chiefs, in former ages, carry back the minds of their present inhabitants to the times of remote antiquity, and impress on them images closely connected with feudal manners and extinguished hostili ties. These ideas are nourished by the pecu liarities of their present condition : their pastoral life in summer, and their contracted sphere of action in the winter, limited to a scanty society within the gloomy precincts of their narrow vallies, surrounded by mountains covered with clouds and fogs, or drenched with rains, and repeating, in various echoes, the scream of wild fowl and the roar of the * Salvator Rosa was born A.

Every thing in such a situation contributes to give a superstitious and melan choly cast to the mind. \" Objects like these,\" says Dr. Beattie, \"diffuse a gloom over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with occasional and social merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and solitude.\"* The same superstitious and gloomy cast of mind is also observable amongst the inhabi tants of the Isle of Man. A modern writer says, that the superstitions of the Manks must be imputed to a native melancholy, nourished by indolence and heightened by the wild, solitary, and romantic scenes, in the midst of which they pass their lives. A Manksman, amidst his lonely mountains, reclines by some romantic stream, the murmuring of which lulls him into a pleasing torpor. Half slumbering, he sees a variety of imaginary beings, which he supposes to be real. Sometimes they may resemble his traditionary ideas of fairies ; and sometimes they may assume the appearance of his friends or his neighbours, attending some nuptial or funeral solemnity. The predomi nant trait in the Manks' character, is indo lence. Great numbers of the people gain their livelihood by fishing ; and as the fishery lasts * Dr. Beattie on Poetry and Music, p. 169."], [41, "11 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. only three months, many of them lie nearly idle the remaining part of the year. From %vhatever cause this hereditary inactivity may originally spring, its influence is certainly strengthened by the tranquil solitude of the lonely vales and mountainous recesses to which the greater part of the inhabitants are accustomed from their infancy.* I he inhabi tants of the towns are, in some degree, exempt from these evils. Society promotes activity ; and activity expels from the mind the clouds of superstition and illusion. Superstition, of one kind or other, is natural to the human mind, till its clouds are dis pelled by the light of reason and philosophy; but it assumes very different appearances from the diversity of climate, of scenery, and of social institutions. The superstitions of the Irish, the Scotch, and the Welch, and, in general, of all northern nations, if not cor rected by moral causes, are of a gloomy and melancholy cast ; while the minds of the people in more southern climes, and amidst more delightful and enlivening scenery, re ceive more agreeable impressions, and the world of imagination assumes a more brilliant appearance. Several writers suppose that the elegant forms of the Greek superstitions, must \u00bb For the indolence and superstitious disposition of the Mauks, sec Robertson's Tour to the Isle of Man, in the year 1791."], [42, "12 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION. be attributed to the beautiful and variegated aspect of their country, where every mountain, valley, and grove \u2014 every fountain and river \u2014 was supposed to be inhabited by invisible deities. To these circumstances may probably be ascribed, the brilliant imagination of their poets. \" The Mediterranean,\" says a learned and sentimental traveller, \" placed in the centre of the civilized world, studded with smiling islands, and washing shores planted with the myrtle, the palm, and the olive, instantly reminds the spectator of that sea, which gave birth to Apollo, to the Nereids, and to Venus ; whereas, the ocean, deformed by tempests and surrounded by unknown regions, was well calculated to be the cradle of the phantoms of Scandinavia.*\" * Chateaubriant's Travels, I. p. 65."], [43, "13 CHAP. II. CLIMATE. On the effects of climate, much has been said by geographers, travellers, historians, and natural philosophers ; but there is scarcely, perhaps, any subject that has given rise to a greater variety of erroneous observations, and of vague and contradictory assertions. That the dispositions and characters of mankind are varied according to the climate, has long been almost a general supposition ; nor can it be doubted, that, when the difference is in the extreme, its influence must be considerable. The Laplander, like his climate, is dull, gloomy, and cold : the African, and the southern Asiatic, under the influence of an ardent sun, are fiery, sensual, and vindictive. Here the views are taken in the strongest point of contrast ; and, when this is the case, the general observation will be found just with few exceptions. Some writers, however,"], [44, "14 CLIMATE. among whom the chief are Helvetius, Hume, and Sismundi, deny that physical causes, such as air or climate, heat or cold, have any influ ence on the genius of man and the character of nations. Helvetius very justly observes, that \" when we look into history, we see nations change their characters on a sudden, without any change in the nature of their climates, or in their nourishment.* It is not to be doubted, that the nature of government, religion, political eveuts, and other moral causes, which will be hereafter investigated, have the greatest and most de cided effects on the human character ; but, notwithstanding the plausible, and, in many respects, rational arguments of those writers, it seems, that man owes much of his bodily temperament, and some portion of his mental qualities, to mere physical causes. \" The cli mate,\" says Chateaubriant, \" operates more or less upon the taste of nations. In Greece, for instance, a suavity, a softness, a repose, pervade all nature, as well as the works of the ancients. You may almost conceive, as it were by intui tion, why the architecture of the Parthenon has such exquisite proportions, why ancient sculpture is so unaffected, so tranquil, so simple, when you have beheld the pure sky * Helvetius', Treatise on Man, vol. 2. p. 9."], [45, "CLIMATE. 15 and the delicious scenery of Athens, of Co rinth, and of Ionia. In this native land of the muses, nature suggests no wild deviations : she tends, on the contrary, to dispose the mind to the love of the uniform and the harmo nious.* Dr. Russell ascribes the early pro ficiency of the lonians or Asiatic Greeks, in the liberal arts, and in all the works depend ing on imagination and sentiment, partly to moral, and partly to physical causes, \u2014 to the long period of peace and prosperity which they had enjoyed, first in a state of indepen dency, and afterwards under the protection of the Lydian monarchs, \u2014 and to a country and climate calculated to awaken and to foster all the powers of genius.- \" The Ionian cities,\" where the elegant arts were most successfully cultivated, \" are more cornmodiously and hap pily situated,\" says Herodotus, \" than any other that we know ; for they are neither chilled with cold, rendered damp by rain, nor exposed to the excesses of heat and drought. \"f In this fine climate, and in a country beauti fully diversified with hills and vallies, inter sected by rivers, indented by bays, and con stantly refreshed with gales from the numer ous isles that crown the Egean sea ; the Asiatic Greeks were favoured with the gayest and the \u00bb Chateaubriant's Travels, p. 71. + Herodot. lib.

Genius, however, is said to be the produce of every clime ; and so indeed it is. \" But the richest growths and fairest shoots of genius, spring from the happiest ex position and the most friendly soil.*'' Here we see the French traveller, and the English his torian, coinciding in the opinion, that the delicious climate and scenery of Greece, the Egean Isles, and Ionia, greatly contributed to the first dawning of Grecian genius. That this might, in some degree, be the case, is a supposition extremely probable ; as a fine climate and beautiful scenery must produce pleasing sensations and excite agreeable ideas. But some writers have carried these speculations much farther, and pretended to calculate the effects of climate on the human imagination, with as much exactness as if the degrees of genius were to be measured by the degrees of latitude. According to this hypothesis of ascribing genius solely to the warmth of the sun, and the influence of the atmosphere, L'Abbe du Bos, Winkleman, and several others, assert, that the English are situated too far to the north to produce any of those vigorous and brilliant exertions of fancy, dis- * Dr. Russell's Ancient Hist. vol. 1 ; and his quotation from Black well's Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, sec. I."], [47, "17 CLIMATE. played in the more southern regions of Greece and Italy. But the futility of these suppo sitions has been completely exposed by an eminent author and artist, who has proved, that, in England, the progress of the fine arts has been impeded, not by frigidity of climate or of imagination, but by various politico religious causes, much more inimical to the growth of refinement and taste, than any com bination of physical circumstances.* No person can be ignorant that climate has a visible influence on every animated being. Nature has adapted different species of ani mals to different latitudes : the African lion would inevitably perish under the polar circle; and the bear of the arctic regions would sink beneath the heats of the torrid zone. Man is the only creature that is able to exist in every climate from the equator to the poles. This capability, however, he derives not from the structure of his corporeal frame, but from his mental faculties, which enable him to invent a variety of artificial means of securing his body against the inclemency of atmospheric influence. t Man, therefore, is subject to the * Vide Barry's Inquiry into the real and imaginary Obstructions to the Advancement of the Arts in England.

When it is fully granted that climate must have a certain influence both on the mental and corporeal frame of man, the philosophical inquirer will still find a difficulty in ascertain ing the mode of its- operation, and the effects which it tends to produce. That the atmos phere has a very powerful influence on the corporeal frame of man, we have convincing proofs in the different degrees of salubrity of different places, and in the different diseases endemial in certain countries. In some ex treme cases, it appears to have a similar influ ence on the faculties and powers of the mind. Of this, nature affords a striking instance in the frequent occurrence of idiocy in the Val lais, or Pais de Vaud, adjoining to the south western part of Switzerland. In this district, idiots are, beyond all comparison, more numer ous than in any other part of the world of equal extent ; and most of them exhibit a spectacle of more complete mental imbecility, than such persons commonly do in any other country. Great numbers of them are deaf and dumb, their stature seldom exceeds four feet and a half, and they always die very"], [49, "19 CLIMATE. touhg. These unfortunate beings, who are here called Cretins, seem therefore to be as de fective in their corporeal powers, as in their intellectual faculties. That there must be some physical cause of this dreadful singu larity, is certain ; and that it is peculiar to the country* is evident from this remarkable circumstance, \u2014 that a family, coming from a distant place to reside in this district, has, in a few years, to lament that idiocy amongst its offspring to which it before was a stranger; while those who remove from the Vallais, soon find themselves happy in the cessation of so deplorable a misfortune. This physical cause can scarcely be any thing else than the nature of the air. The district is a vast bason full of the copious exhalations which arise from the Rhone, and the marshes adjoining to that river ; and the surrounding mountains, which rise almost perpendicular, preventing the dis persion of these vapours, create an atmosphere singular for its humidity and heat.* It seems, therefore, that the nature of the air is the pri mary cause of the idiocy so unhappily preva lent in the Vallais. Its operation, however, appears to be confined to particular constitu tions ; for, although corporeal and mental * Sir R. Clayton's paper Mem. Manchester Society, vol. 3.

There are, indeed, but few causes that act strongly on every indivi dual. The operation of one is frequently counteracted by that of another ; and it is sometimes very difficult to calculate the force of their agency. But it is certain, that effects such as have here been described, can be pro duced only by physical causes ; and no other can be discovered, or even supposed, than the nature of the atmosphere. Amidst the vast accumulation of opposite opinions and vague observations, made by his torians and physiologists, it is often extremely difficult to place the connexion between causes and effects in a luminous point of view. It has been generally assumed, that the human body is invigorated by cold, but relaxed and ener vated by heat, and, consequently, that a northern climate is the most favourable to courage and strength, as well as to health and longevity. But the writers who have treated this subject, advance such a farrago of un founded assertions, isolated or unauthenticated facts, and contradictory arguments, as can have no other tendency than to perplex and puzzle the inquirer. Mr. Orme, in speaking of Hin doostan, says, \" The courage of the people depends on the climate. In the northern"], [51, "21 CLIMATE. parts, firmer fibres produce a proportionable degree of resolution : in the southern, all is sensibility, and fear must predominate in such as are infinitely susceptible of the minutest impressions.\"* But he invalidates this argu ment by what he afterwards adds. He says, that \" Persons of high rank and distinction are seldom wanting in an intrepidity as little sensible of the apprehension of danger, as the pusillanimity of the lower and meaner people is incapable of resisting such impulses.,,-t' From this contrast between those who rule and those who obey, it appears that some other cause besides the influence of climate, which operates on all, must occasion the difference. The only physical causes that can be assigned, must be the nature of their food, which, amongst the lower classes, is not sufficient to give firmness and strength to the body, and the distinction of casts by which the Hindoos are divided into separate tribes, whose peculiar dispositions and characters are perpetuated from generation to generation. But the prin cipal cause of so marked a difference, is, un doubtedly, the state of depression and degra dation in which the lower orders are held, and which deprives them of all magnanimity and * Orme's Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire. + Orme's Hist.

Thunberg agrees in opinion with Orme respecting the enervating power of a hot cli mate. \"The inhabitants of the warmer climates,\" says that traveller, \" have a dull and torpid brain, and are less acute and pene trating than the Europeans. They have the power of thinking, but not profoundly.\"\u2014^ \" They are in general idle, sleepy, and lascivi ous. To these qualities the heat of the cli mate inclines them. And without insulting the greater part of the dark brown inhabitants of the East Indies, one may truly say, that there is a greater difference between them and the Europeans, than between the monkies and them.\" And again, \" the heat of the climate has such an influence on the Europeans who arrive here, that in time, they become heavy, inactive, and less lively than they were in the colder climates ; so that the most industrious man, against his inclination, frequently sinks into a state of inactivity and idleness.\"* Thunberg agrees with all other travellers respecting the insalubrious and enervating air of Batavia ; but he also observes that the Europeans in that settlement with few ex ceptions, live in a very irregular and intem- * Thunberg's Trav. v. 2. p. 296\u2014297."], [53, "CLIMATE. 23 perate manner, spending most of their time in luxurious feasts and entertainments.* Such a mode of living has in every country a strong tendency to enervate both the body and the mind; but in the sultry atmosphere of Batavia, situated amidst pestilential morasses under a tropical climate, the effects must be ex tremely pernicious, especially to the natives of a temperate zone.

We may assert with greater confidence, that the keen air of Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives, who were in general of a more lofty stature than the people of the south, gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent exertions than to patient labour, and inspired them with consti tutional bravery, which is the result of nerves and spirits. The severity of a winter cam paign, that chilled the courage of the Romans, was scarcely felt by these hardy children of the north, who, in their turn, were unable to resist the summer heats, and dissolved away in lan guor and sickness under the beams of an Italian sun.\"* All that can here be gathered from Gibbon's assertion is, that the Romans could endure heat better than cold, and that the Germans could bear cold better than heat, or in other words, that each found the climate to which they had been accustomed from infancy, the most suitable to their bodily temperament. The Romans, however, as Mr. Gibbon is obliged to acknowledge, made war in all cli mates, and yet were preserved in health and vigour, a circumstance which he ascribes to their excellent discipline. -j- The same writer * Gibbon's Dec.

In later times, however, we find that the heats of the torrid zone have not, either in Asia, Africa, or America, arrested the progress of European discoverers, colonists, or conquerors. When historians so frequently mention the \" hardy sons of the north,\" an expression which, from being so often repeated, is become almost proverbial, they seem to insinuate that the Goths and Germans, and other inhabitants of those parts of Europe that are situated to the north of the Danube, were of a firmer tex ture of body, and had stronger nerves than the people of Italy and the other countries that composed the Roman empire. This also ap pears to have been the opinion of the Romans themselves, who being enervated by luxury and not bv the warmth of their climate, which * Dec. Rom.

Mr. Gibbon, in speaking of the Gothic prisoners distributed in the cities of the east, by the Emperor Valens, observes, that the Roman provincials were soon familiarized with their savage appearance, and ventured by degrees to measure their own strength in wrestling and other athletic exercises, with those formidable adversaries, whose name had so long inspired them with terror.* He also subjoins in a note in the next page, on the authority of Eunapias, that the provincials on becoming familiar with these northern barbarians found that their strength was more apparent than real. They were tall of stature ; but their legs were clumsy and their shoulders were narrow.

Basil, when only a domestic, overthrew with ease, at the first onset, a famous barbarian wrestler, who had challenged the boldest aud most robust of the Greeks.* The venerable father of history tells us, that Cambyses medi tating the conquest of Ethiopia, sent ambassa dors to the king or emperor with rich presents and strong professions of friendship, for the concealed purpose of discovering the state of the country.

But in transferring our views from individual instances to national characteristics, we shall find that the Abyssi nians, the Galli, and other nations of central Africa, Avhich the ancients designated by the name of Ethiopia, are strong, courageous, and extremely ferocious. The negroes of Guinea are also robust, and able to endure great fatigue. And, although all these nations are situated in the hottest regions within the torrid zone, it does not appear that their bodies are relaxed, or their powers impaired by the heat of the cli mate. Unfeeling avarice long endeavoured to propagate and establish an opinion, that the unfortunate negroes were beings of an inferior class, formed by nature, and designed by provi dence, for a state of perpetual slavery. But the dictates of Christianity, and the penetration of an enlightened age, have exploded a position so injurious to human nature. A judicious and observing writer, speaking of the negroes, says, \" Their orators, who speak in their pala vers, are in general men who have passed the prime of life ; but they are often very success ful in exciting the passions, by their bold and figurative language, which flows in torrents, and is sometimes such as would not disgrace an"], [59, "29 CLIMATE. eastern poet.''* The constitution of Hayti, published in 1805, is no unfavourable specimen of the abilities of the negroes ; and amongst them, numerous instances might be adduced of individual proficiency in science and literature.

Gregoire, in his memoir, very justly observes, \" That their vices are the effects of tyranny : but their virtues are their own.'' Writers of distinguished reputation not un frequently make use of arguments and asser tions, which are calculated rather to invite assent by their plausibility, than to produce conviction by evidence. Dr. Robertson has filled a hundred and fifty pages with his ela borate investigation of the character of the American savages, in which he exerts all his eloquence to establish his favourite theory, that heat of climate causes pusillanimity, while cold has a contrary effect. J But, in regard to the Caribbees, a fierce and courage ous race of men, he finds himself obliged to make an exception.

The Dpctor, however, in order to make facts coin cide with his theory, supposes them to have originated from the far more distant country of Florida, although this conjecture is in direct opposition to their own traditions, as well as to all geographical appearances.* He is also obliged to confess, that some nations in Brazil were no less eminent for vigour of mind and bravery in war; and, in a note, he quotes Lery, who had been an eye witness of the courage and ferocity of the Toupinambos, a Brazilian tribe. \" These people,\" says Lery, \" are so fierce and courageous, that, as long as the least remains of strength are left, they fight without ceasing, and never take refuge in flight. f In fine, examples of the courage and ferocity of the nations of the torrid zone are so numerous, and so well attested, as to wholly invalidate Dr. Robertson's conclusions in regard to the influence of climate on the corporeal and mental faculties of man. Notwithstanding, therefore, the insinuations so frequently thrown out by historians, and the theories framed by physiologists, it is far * Vide note xcvi.

This assertion will scarcely be credited without irrefragable proof; but unexceptionable evidence may be easily adduced ; and, indeed, it presents itself from every quarter. A judicious traveller observes, that the Spaniards and Portuguese can bear a surprising degree of heat, cold, and fatigue ; that the southern Europeans are not weak or effeminate ; but that they are, perhaps, more enterprising and persevering than the inhabitants of the north.* To the testimony of a writer so unprejudiced, and so capable of judging, may be added that of many British officers, who have witnessed the hardships and privations to which the Spanish armies were exposed in the early stage of their late contest with Frances Arabia is situated under the tropic of Cancer : half of the country is within the torrid zone ; and the heat of its climate is greater than in most of the regions nearer the * Professor Link's Travels, p. 129. t Sir J.Moore's Campaign in Spain, p. 71, 72, and 75.

In this dreary waste, a boundless level of sand is sometimes intersected by sharp and naked mountains ; and the face of the desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the intense rays of an almost vertical sun. The winds often diffuse a noxious, and even a deadly vapour ; and the sands, when put in motion, have buried whole caravans. Water is so scarce that it is often an object of contest. The country is entirely destitute of any thing like a navigable river, if we except the Eu phrates, which washes its north-eastern limits; and wood is not less scarce than water.* A shady grove, a green pasture, a spring, or a stream of water, are sufficient to attract a colony of Arabs to the fortunate spot which * Dr. Vincent thinks that Arabia deserta is not quite so barren as it is generally represented.

But the Arabian armies, under Mahomed and his immediate successors, were not very numerous; and the first Caliphs extended their conquests less by the number than by the enthusiasm of their troops, till at length the inha bitants of the conquered countries, having embraced the islam, began to list under their banners.

Yet in these dreary regions, the Ara bians were at all times remarkable for their activity, courage, and contempt of death, as well as for their natural genius and vivid imagination.* The parching heat of the cli mate had not impaired either their bodily or mental powers. As soon as their different tribes were collected under one head, they displayed a valour in war seldom equalled by any other nation ; and as soon as their empire was completely established, their progress in knowledge was not less remarkable. But political events have reduced them to the dis organized and barbarous state in which they were before the appearance of Mahomed. A late traveller, in his descriptions of Ger- many, and of the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, has entered into various inquiries relating to the influence of climate, and the state of the southern and northern nations in ancient and modern times ; and in the com parison of their beauty, their strength, and their intellects, his decision is entirely in favour of the inhabitants of the south. \" That ideal beauty,'' says the Baron de Reisbeck, * Sale's Koran Prelim.

Even among the Saxons, the fairest creatures under the sun, that are not Grecians,* you seldom meet with a face which has any appear ance of ideal beauty ; and yet these are in the north, what the women of Florence are in the south, and far exceed all their country women in life and spirit.\" * The Baron de Reisbeck, or rather his translator, here seems to speak of beauty of feature, and countenance, and not solely of fairnes? of complexion, in which it must be presumed, that the Germans have always equalled or even excelled the Greeks,"], [65, "CLIMATE. 35 \" The men of the north are equally destitute of ideal beauty. Winkleman himself thinks that better models, for the study of male beauty, are to be met with in Naples and Sicily, than amongst his countrymen, the Saxons, although they are, without any comparison, the hand somest of the northern nations.\" It is not, however, impossible that the Baron de Reisbeck may deceive himself in a com parison between the beauty of the Germans and that of the Greeks, in estimating the former by real nature, and the latter by the works of ancient art. The fine imagination and the exquisite judgment of the Grecian artists, had invented an ideal standard of beauty, appropriated to each object, and ex pressive of its attributes ; and the statues of their gods and their heroes, were formed after models existing in the mind of the sculptor, rather than from any pattern afforded by nature. M. de Chateaubriant says, \" The women of Athens were never celebrated for beauty.\" And as a proof of this assertion, he adds, \" That all the most illustrious personages of that city, Pericles, Sophocles, Socrates, Aristotle, and the divine Plato, were attached to foreign females.* Experience, however, affords numerous proofs, that in the passion of * Chateaubriant's Trav. in Greece, &c. v. 1. p. 222 c 2"], [66, "36 CLIMATE. love, and the estimate of beauty, no stress can be laid on the caprice of individuals, however distinguished by talents or exalted in rank. But without adopting the very questionable opinion that Athens was deficient in female beauty, we may safely doubt, whether the whole range of Attica, Ionia, and the Egean isles, could have afforded a model for the Medicean Venus. It is difficult to assign the real cause of that beauty which a celebrated English traveller considers as peculiar to the females of Cyprus. The climate he describes, not only as exces sively hot, but also extremely insalubrious.* Yet he says, \" The women of Cyprus are hand somer than those of any other Grecian island. They have a taller and more stately figure ; and the features, particularly those of the women of Nicosia, are regular and dignified, exhibiting that elevated cast of countenance so univer sally admired in the works of Grecian artists. At present, this kind of beauty seems peculiar to the women of Cyprus : the sort of expression exhibited by one set of features, may be traced with different gradations in them all. Hence were possibly derived those celebrated models of female beauty, conspicuous in the statues, \u2022 Dr. Clarke's Trav. part 2. p. 309, 310, 311, and 312.

It must here be observed, that the beauty of the Cypriots cannot arise either from their physical circumstances, or from the com- forts of their political situation. Dr. Clarke gives this concise, but pathetic description of the state of their country : \u2014 \" Agriculture neg- lected, \u2014 inhabitants oppressed, \u2014 population destroyed, \u2014 pestiferous air, \u2014 contagion, \u2014 po- verty, \u2014 indolence, \u2014 desolation.\"f And he says the oppressions are so great, and the emi- grations or rather flights, are so frequent, that \" The population of all Cyprus scarcely ex ceeds sixty thousand persons, a number for merly insufficient to people one of its towns.J * Dr. Clarke's Trav. part 2. p. 338.

This is somewhat astonishing, that so much beauty should exist amidst such an accumula tion of physical and moral misery, under a cli mate so insalubrious, and a government so tyrannical. If the remarks of this celebrated traveller be accurate, the singular beauty of the Cypriots must proceed from some cause not easily to be accounted for by any known rules of physiology. From the comparison of southern and northern beauty, M. de Reisbeck proceeds to an estimate of the relative proportion of strength among the inhabitants of the colder and the warmer regions of Europe. \" It is well known,\" says he, \" that no German will attempt to vie with the inhabitants of the southern countries in point of beauty ; but, when you tell a German that the inhabitants of the south are stronger and more durably built than those of the north, they look upon this as a great paradox ; and yet strength is the principal point of manly beauty. Have you ever seen a Sicilian wrestle with a Hano verian or a Westphalian? I consider wrestling as the greatest proof of strength.

We are not now to consider, that, in the pre sent day, the latter are so much excelled in discipline ; for, in the time of Charles V. they were both alike. But the German troops in Spain and Italy, served only once ; and few of the armies, which the Emperors carried into Italy with them, ever came home. On the contrary, the Spaniards, under Charles V. fought many battles with great reputation on the Rhine, as well as in Holland,* the climate of which is so different from their own : they shewed more valour, and bore greater fatigues, than the natives themselves, who must have been subdued had it not been that they were assisted by external circum stances, and that the Prince of Orange's spirit did more than all the Minheers put together.'' \" The national pride of the Germans has led them to give themselves a pre-eminence over the southern nations, which history, nature, and appearances, equally give the lie to.-\\ They imagine that understanding, cou- * Reisbeck has, in this place, made a mistake.

On the contrary, consider what is deposed by history, appearances, and nature. History teaches us that light is come into the world from the south ; appearances teach us that the Spaniards and Italians are much more frugal in eating and drinking, and, probably too, in the enjoyments of love, than the Ger mans, amongst whom we include the Danes, the Swedes, the Russians, and the Poles ;* and nature teaches us, that bodily and mental beauty are commonly to be found where the great Creator of the bodies of men has ap pointed the finest forms, and the greatest strength. t Let us examine this position a little more fully : compare the understandings of men, as they are more and more removed from the happy air of Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy, till you come to the North Pole, and you will find, that nature does not suffer the in habitants of the coast of Barbary, the Arabs, the people of the coast of Guinea, and the i * Reisbeck here makes a singular classification.

Reisbeck, \" perhaps you will tell me, that at present, the inhabi tants of the north, excel those of the south.

And yet the climate of North America is not so adverse to the English, as that of the north of Germany was to the Romans ; nor was Germany at that time near so well cultivated as North America now is. Let a man conceive Varus's army on the river St. Lawrence, Lake Superior, the Lake of the Illinois, and the upper regions of the Missippi, and still he will have no true idea of their situation in Germany. They were far from possessing the facilities of pro viding for the exigences of war, which they would have had in North America. Germany was, at that time, an uninterrupted wood : its rivers were not confined within a standing bed, but in several places, formed immense moras ses, too many and too visible marks of which still remain.\" * Reisbeck here speaks in a hyperbolical stile : many nations, even all those of Asia and Africa, knew much less of discipline than the North.

The ge nerality of the Spaniards and Italians of this age, are by no means a weak people. It is not, therefore, the climate alone that makes the difference : it is rather the weak and nervous system of the northern nations that renders them unable to bear the contrast of the hot days and cold nights, which braces up the strong built natives ; nor can they support the change made in their way of life. The great bodies of the Dutch, Danes, and Poles, are mere lumps of flesh and bones, the former of which is disgustingly flabby.

Mr. Orme says, \" The texture of the human frame in India seems to bear propor tion with the rigidity of the northern monsoon, as that does with the distance from Tartary ; but as in the southern monsoon, heats are felt at the very foot of mount Caucasus, as intense as in any part of India, very few of the inhabi tants of Hindostan are endowed with the ner vous strength, or athletic size, of the most robust nations of Europe. Southward of Lahore, we see through India a race of men whose make, physionoiny, and defect of muscu lar strength, convey ideas of effeminacy which surprises, when pursued through such numbers of the species, and when compared with the form of the European, who is making the observation. \" The muscular strength of the Indian is still less than might be expected from the appear ance of the texture of his frame. Two English sawyers have performed in one day, the work of thirty-two Indians: allowances being made for the difference of dexterity, and the advan tage of European instruments, the disparity is still very great, and would have been more so, had the Indian been obliged to work with the instrument of the European, as he could scarcely have been able to wield it.

There are not more extraordinary tumblers in the world. Their messengers will go fifty miles a day, for twenty or thirty days without inter mission. Their infantry march faster, and with less weariness, than Europeans, but could not march at all, if they were to carry the same baggage and accoutrements. Exceptions to this general defect of nervous strength, are found among the inhabitants of the mountains, which run in ranges of various directions throughout the continent of Hindostan. In these, even under the tropic, Europeans have met with a savage, whose bow they could scarcely draw to the head of a formidable arrow, tinged with the blood of tigers, whose skins he offers to sale.\" After exhibiting this picture of the weakness and effeminacy of the people of India, Mr. Orme proceeds to trace these defects to what may be denominated the indirect influence of the climate. \" It is cer tain,\" says he, \" that there is no climate in which we may not find the same effects pro duced on the human species, as in climates entirely different in situation, and in every"], [77, "47 CLIMATE. other circumstance. The Sybarites, whose territory was not more than a day's journey from the country of the Horatii, the Cincin nati, and the Scipios, were more effeminate than the subjects of Sardanapulus ; and there are Sybarites, at this day, in the country of Vercingetorix. The Britons, although they possess at this day, all the courage of their painted ancestors, who beat the greatest gene ral in the world out of their country, are doubtless incapable of bearing, like them, the fatigue and hardships of a campaign. But it would be in contradiction to all our feelings, not to allow, that it is much more difficult to bring the human race to particular habits in some countries than in others. To make a Sybarite of an inhabitant of the 50th degree of latitude, infinite inventions must have been car ried to the greatest perfection. Apartments must be closed and warmed, so as to render the alterations of seasons little sensible to him : he must be carried in vehicles, contrived to be as warm as the room which he leaves, and almost as easy as the chair in which he slumbers ; his food must be every thing that is not simple.\" \" To produce the same effects in such a country as Hindostan,\" continues Mr. Orme, \" nothing is necessary but to give the man his daily food. The effect of the sun, on the per spiration of the human body, together with"], [78, "48 CLIMATE. the softness of the air, renders this secretion in India more powerful than the effect of labour in other countries. The awkward con straint arising from rest in northern climates, is the call of nature, to throw off something noxious to the habit, or to quicken the circula tion into warmth. Sensible of neither of these impulses, and satisfied with the present sense of ease, the inhabitant of Hindostan has no conception of anj' thing salutary in the use of exercise, and receiving no agreeable sensation from it, considers it in those not obliged to it by necessity, as ridiculous.\" To these obser vations he adds others, respecting the facility of procuring food, from the abundance of spontaneous productions, the easy culture of rice, which is sown immediately before the periodical rains, by which the labour of water ing is greatly diminished, the ready means of constructing houses, with a trifling labour, the little necessity of fuel and clothing, and the few wants of a people abstemious in diet, and whose constant beverage is water, all inebria ting liquors being prohibited by the Hindoo religion. \" The bamboo,\" says Mr. Orme, \" which grows every where, requires only one stroke of the hatchet to split it from one end to the other, and to divide it into laths of all lengths, and of the smallest size ; while entire, it is"], [79, "49 6LIMATE: strong enough to serve as the support of such houses as the climate demands ; for in the greater part of Hindostan, the bare earth affords a repose without danger of diseases in so temperate a climate. The palm and cocoa nut trees give their large fanlike leaves, which naturally separate into long divisions, with which a mat may be made in a few minutes. A number of these mats laid over the scaffold ing, erected with no other materials than the bamboo and packthread, compose in a day, a house, in which the Indian may live for six months, in those parts of Hindostan which are not subject to much rain. Isa better house is required, walls of mud are carried up to the height of six or seven feet, and rendered, in A few days, extremely hard by the intense heat of the sun : these are covered with thatch, made of rushes or the stems of rice ; and many per sons of good casts, and far from being distressed in their fortunes, even Bramins, are satisfied with such a habitation. There are bricks, and very good ones in India ; but a brick house is a certain mark that the inhabitant is either extravagant or rich.* It is easy to conceive, that a people, whose habits of life are so simple, and whose wants are so few, living in a country where the cli- * Orme's Dissert, on the effeminacy of the inhabitants of Hindostan r"], [80, "50 CLIMATE, mate and the soil concur in producing abun dant supplies, should have far less need of labour, than nations situated in colder and less fertile regions. But this consideration will not account for the ph\u0153nomena of character, which are found amongst the nations of the torrid zone. Of all the inhabitants of the tro pical countries, the natives of Hindostan, and the Aborigines of the West India islands, are those alone whose characters display any re marakble degree of pusillanimity. The Bir mans, are bold, active, and robust. Their shipwrights are described as athletic men, \" Possessing in an eminent degree, that vigour which distinguishes Europeans, and gives them pre-eminence over the enervated nations of the east ; nor do I imagine,\" says Major Symes, \" that the inhabitants of any country are capa ble of greater bodily exertions than the Bir mans.\"* They are also extremely addicted to poetry and music : they have epic as well as religious poems of great celebrity, and are fond of reciting in heroic verse, the exploits of their kings and generals, f The character of the Birmans is in almost every respect the reverse of that of the people of Bengal ; and yet they live under the same degrees of latitude, and nothing but a range of mountains separates the * Major Syme's Embassy to Ava, v. 2. p. 134. t Syme's Embassy to Ava, v. 2. p. 330\u2014399."], [81, "51 CLIMATE. two countries. Both in the climate and soil, and in the spontaneous abundance of nature* the Birman empire greatly resembles Hindos- tan ; and no physical cause whatever can be assigned for the contrast of character exhibited by the two nations.* The Malays, who may also be considered as neighbours to the Hindoos, inhabit countries equally fertile, and in a more southerly situation, being in the middle of the torrid zone. These Malays, however, instead of resembling the Hindoos in that pusil- lanimity which the heat of the climate is sup- posed to inspire, are the boldest and fiercest of the human race. They are the pirates of the Indian seas: one of their barks with twenty- five or thirty men has been known to board European ships of thirty or forty guns, to take possession of them, and murder with their poignards the greatest part of the crew. The Malay history is full of such enterprises which mark the desperate resolution of these barba- rains.

If climate possessed, either directly or in directly, all the influence and power ascribed to it by Orme, Thunberg, and many other travellers, physiologists, and historians, no such difference could exist among nations in habiting countries so similar in climate, soil, and productions, as that which is found between the ferocious Malay, and the peaceable passive Hindoo, whose characters are as diame trically opposite as if one lived under the equator and the other under the pole. If these examples were not sufficient, we need only cast a glance on the inhabitants of Madagascar, and on the various nations and tribes of cen tral Africa, where we find in the regions of the torrid zone, the Gallas, the Giagas, the Ansi cans, and other numerous hordes equally fierce, robust, and rapacious, not to mention the more civilized Abyssinians, whose appearance and character exhibit no marks either of bodily weakness or mental pusillanimity. Turning our eyes from the old to the new world, we find, nothwithstanding Dr. Robert son's hypothesis, that the boldest and fiercest of its original inhabitants resided within the limits of the torrid zone. The Spaniards and Portuguese in their first attempts to conquer"], [83, "CLIMATE. 53 and colonise South America, found all those vast regions, which extend from the Andes to the Atlantic, and from the tropic of Capricorn to the tenth degree of north latitude, inhabited by ferocious and warlike tribes. The civilized and peaceable Peruvians, in a climate less warm than any other within the torrid zone, were the people who shewed the least courage in defending their country. The Mexicans, living in a tropical region, were the most southerly, and by far the most warlike and powerful of the nations of North America. In making a circuit round the torrid zone, we find the prevailing character of most of its inhabi tants, directly the reverse of that which has, by many writers, been-supposed to result from the influence of its climate. The Hindoos appear to furnish the only exception worthy of notice; but it is evident that their distinguishing characteristics are not the effects of their cli mate. Their Mahomedan conquerors and rulers, residing among them, breathing the same air, and exposed to the same atmospheric influence, remain very different, both in ex terior appearance and character.

A proof of this I experienced in myself. Notwithstand ing the continual and great fatigues which I underwent in my excursions among those rocks, and, notwithstanding my advanced age, I felt in myself an energy and vigour of body, an agility and liveliness of mind, and a certain * Spalanzani'sTrav.in Sicily, chap. 8."], [85, "55 CLIMATE. animation of my whole frame which 1 had ex- perienced no where else, except on the summit of Mount Etna.

How immense the dif- ference between this most pure and almost celestial air, and the foetid and foggy atmos- phere of some of the low plains of Lombardy, surrounded by stagnant and muddy waters, and unhealthful rice grounds, producing con- tinual clouds and fogs in winter, and obstinate fevers in summer; where the spirits are depres- sed and rendered dull : and where, to complete the catalogue of ills and inconveniences, innu merable hosts of frogs in the warm season, both by night and by day, deafen the ear with their incessant croakings.''* With the greatest respect and deference for the talents and judgment of this scientific traveller, it may however be observed, that the plains of Lombardy, which Spalanzani de scribes as the region of impure air and muddy water, and the city of Venice envelloped in its * Spalanzani'sTrav. conclusion of chap. 24."], [86, "56 CLIMATE. moist and foggy atmosphere, have produced many of those illustrious painters, poets, and literati, who have conferred so much glory on Italy. Amongst the celebrated painters, Cor reesrio was born near Modena : Titian was a CO native of the province of Friuli, and resided the greatest part of his life at Venice :* Giorgione was a native and inhabitant of the same district; Tintoretto also was a native of Venice: Guido, Dominichino, and the three Carracci, all drew their first breath at Bologna : Parmeggiana and Lanfranco were natives and residents of Parma: Poesy is, not less than painting, indebted to Lombardy. Mantua, environed by marshes, produced the prince of the latin poets, Virgil, whose immortal works will be read as long as Rome shall exist, or her language and name be remembered. Vida, the first poet of the second Augustan age of Roman literature, was a native of Cremona ; although Naples gave birth to Sannazarius, whose classical verse has eternized the ancient glory of the Queen of the Adriatic. f But a long list of names might be produced to * The foggy atmosphere of the country near the Po and of Venice, neither damped the genius of Titian nor shortened his life ; he died at Venice, A.

They only tend to shew, that civil institutions and social circumstances are in most cases able to counteract and even to annihilate the effects of natural causes. The pure air on the summit of Etna could not have afforded to Spalanzani the same helps towards mental improvement, as he found in the university of Padua, nor to Muratori and Tiraboschi those which they met with in the library of the Duke of Modena ; neither could the fine atmosphere of the \u00c6olian isles have animated the genius of the above mentioned eminent painters, like the patronage which they received from the popes and the princes of Italy. Bologna, situated near the foot of the Ap pennines, although enjoying an air somewhat more pure than the low parts of Lombardy, is far more remarkable for the fertility of its soil than for the purity of its atmosphere. That city, however, has produced a greater number of eminent painters and literati than any other in Italy, except Rome and Florence, while Naples, enjoying one of the finest cli mates in the world, has not been distinguished by any excellence in -letters or arts. Bologna, therefore, owes this pre-eminence solely to her institutions and her liberal patronage of merit. \" The two grand features of the Bolognese character,\" says a judicious traveller, \"are"], [89, "CLIMATE. 59 formed by the two most honourable passions that can animate the human soul, \u2014 the love of knowledge and the love of liberty ; passions which predominate through the whole series of their history, and are justly expressed on their standard. \" Libertas\" blazes in golden letters in the centre, while \" Bononia docet'* waves in embroidery down the borders.* \" In general,\" says the Baron de Reisbeck, \" nature displays a far different vigour, a far more magnificent spirit of creation in the south, than she does in the northern provinces.

Why then should not nature, which weaves every thing else, more strongly in a warm climate, also weave man more strongly there ? It is indeed, true, that understanding and morals are no exclusive property of any strip of land. They depend on laws, customs, education, and government, which may, and often do render the artificial man superior to the natural one. But the natural understanding awakes sooner from its sleep in a warm country, than it does in a cold one. Under a warm sun, abstract ideas are more quickly formed. The senses are much clearer, and the understanding depends on the quickness of the senses. Imagination, which is so connected with all the operations of the sun, has more force in Sicily than in Iceland. The first force of impressions made by the senses, gives the powers of the mind an alacrity in the southern countries, which is the true character of genius, and which the inhabi tants of the north cannot reach by any cold abstractions which they may arrive at from their manners, customs, and government. Nor are the fine moral feelings so independent of the fine sensual ones, as some philosophers who know little of human nature, are willing to imagine.*\" \u2022 Reisbeck 's Trav. vol.3, lett. 59. p. 128. &c"], [91, "61 CLIMATE. In perusing these extracts, the reader will perceive, that Reisbeck's expressions are often confused and ill chosen ; and that his language, in the English translation, is very inelegant ; but his observations in general are just, and his theory will bear the test of examination. It is certain that all vegetable and animal life appears far more vigorous in the tropical than in the polar regions. Heat is the principle of all animation. The fierceness of the lion and the strength of the elephant, are found in the highest perfection under the burning climates of Africa and southern Asia ; while the arctic regions, with the single exception of the bear, produce only animals of a timid disposition or a diminutive size. It is, therefore, analogous to the whole system of animated nature, that the human species should display a greater degree of perfection in a warm, than in an in tensely cold climate : and this theory is con fimed by the evidence of fact. Sir George Staunton observes, that the human frame is better suited to the hottest than the coldest climate.* And if we compare the fierce Malay, the acute and vigorous Birman, the well sized and athletic Abyssinian, the robust negro, and the ferocious tribes of central Africa, with the timid, unwarlike, and diminutive Laplander, * Sir G.

Although historians often speak of the hardy and warlike nations of the north, it ought to be remembered, that the Goths were a horde which emigrated from the northern and eastern shores of the Caspian sea. But a colony of them took possession of Scandinavia, where their descendants being joined by the Saxons and other German tribes, desolated the coasts of Europe by their piratical expeditions. Not only the Goths, but the Vandals, the Huns, the Siempi, and all the other martial barba rians who subverted the Roman empire and over-ran Europe, issued from the central re gions of Asia, situated between the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude. Within the same limits, were also comprised the original seats of the Turks, the Mongols, the Manshurs, and all those warlike nations who conquered, in later times, so many of the southern countries of Asia.

Among the physical causes which must be considered as producing perceptible effects on the bodily and mental powers and faculties of the human species, and consequently on the character of nations, the nature of the food on which they chiefly subsist, will hold a distin guished place. There is no doubt, says an eminent physician, that the whole constitu tion of body may be changed by diet alone. The fluids may be thereby attenuated or con densed, rendered mild or acrimonious, coagu lated or diluted, to almost any degree. Nor are its effects upon the solids less considerable. They may be braced or relaxed, have their sensibility, motions, &c. greatly increased or diminished by different kinds of aliment.* * Buchan's Domestic Medicine, chap. 3."], [95, "65 FOOD But notwithstanding the perfection to which natural philosophy and medical science have attained, it is not easy to determine either from theory or facts, what kind of food may be the most suitable to the human constitution, in different situations, employments, and climates. Temperance, however, is universally allowed to be the most conducive to health and vigour of body and mind. The brook fed blood of the hermit is richer in its qualities and contributes more effectually to the continuance of life and energy, than that of the epicurean, whose cir culation is daily excited and forcibly propelled by the most poignant sauces and wines of the highest flavour. Factitious means of exciting the animal spirits impart a momentary feeling and appearance of vigour ; but at the same time they destroy its substance and reality. The diet of the Russian populace is extremely coarse and simple, and appears to be calculated for promoting longevity ; but their love of strong liquors, when they are able to procure them, often counteracts the effects of their abstemiousness in food. In all the lower classes, the soldiery excepted, a healthy old age is very common. \" Lively old men of a hundred years,\" says Mr. Tooke, \" are, in all parts of Russia, no unusual appearance; but probably the number of them would be far greater if the propensity to dram drinking r"], [96, "66 POOD were not the occasion of so great a mortality in the middle period of life.* It has been doubted by some, whether ani mal food be necessary to maintain the human body in the full perfection of vigour. Dr. A. Smith says, \" That grain and other vegetables, with the help of milk, cheese, and butter, or oil, where butter is not to be had, it is well known from experience, can, without any butcher's meat, afford the most plentiful, the most wholesome, the most nourishing, and the most invigorating diet.\"f It has even been asserted, that the nations which subsist on vegetable diet, are of all men, the handsomest and the most robust, the least exposed to diseases and violent passions, and they also are those who attain to the greatest longevity.]: Some kinds of vegetable diet, however, are far more salu brious and more invigorating than others. The author of the Wealth of Nations says, \" In some parts of Lancashire, it is pretended, that bread made of oatmeal, is a heartier food for labouring people than w heaten bread ; and I have frequently heard the same doctrine main tained in Scotland. I am, however, some what doubtful of the truth of it. The common * Tooke's View of Russ. Emp. v. 2. p. 4. &c. + Wealth of Nations, v.3. p. 355. X Bernardin de St. Pieire, Stnd.

They neither work so well nor look so well ; and as there is not the same difference between the people of fashion in the two countries, experi- ence would seem to shew, that the food of the common people in Scotland is not so suitable to the human constitution as that of their neighbours of the same rank in England.\" But he observes, that it seems to be otherwise with potatoes, and says that the strongest men and the handsomest women in the British dominions, are found amongst the lower orders of the Irish, who subsist chiefly on that root, and use very little of either butcher's meat or bread. He adds, that \" No food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution.*'' In examining Dr. Smith's eulogium of the potatoe, it is proper to observe, that in general, the poorest of the Irish peasantry rent a small piece of ground and keep a cow. By this means they are furnished with milk ; and if they be obliged to sell all their butter, which is very often the case, they have butter milk in \u2022 Smith's Wealth of Nations, v. 1. p. 25S\u2014 259.

The soundness and strength of the human constitution depends, in a great measure, on the simplicity of the diet in an early period of life ; for whatever a more advanced age may admit or require, youth has certainly no need of any stimulus. It is through this cause that the most robust men are generally met with amongst those who have, during the period of youth, been accus tomed to live on the coarest fare, and to take much bodily exercise.* In regard to his observations on oatmeal bread, Dr. Smith appears either to have been misinformed respecting facts, or mistaken in calculating causes and consequences. His comparison of the lower class of people in Scotland with those of England, seems to be just ; but if the former be somewhat inferior to the latter in robust appearance and capability of labour, they are able to endure far greater hardships and privations ; and if they possess a less degree of bodily strength than their * If labour be excessive, it soon wears out the human machine ; but as this can never be a national case, it does not come within the limits of any inquiry relative to national character,"], [99, "69 FOOD southern neighbours, that circumstance must be ascribed to the general poverty and parsi- mony of their food, rather than to the particu- lar article of oatmeal. In Lancashire, and the western parts of Yorkshire, Dr. Smith's obser- vation is far from being verified. The lower class of people in these districts, use scarcely any other bread but that which is made of oatmeal ; and they are as robust and athletic, and as capable of great exertions of strength, as the inhabitants of any other part of Great Britain. But it must be observed, that in the districts just mentioned, they use a sufficient quantity of animal food as well as of whole- some beer. Oatmeal, therefore, constitutes only a moderate proportion of their food. But Dr. Smith seems to have drawn his theory from those poor parts of Scotland where it may be considered as almost the whole nourriture of the inhabitants. His comparison of the superior classes in England and Scotland is also inconclusive. Amidst the profusion of different aliments used by people of that de- scription, bread is so far from being a princi- pal article of food, that whether it be made of oatmeal or wheaten flour is a matter of little importance in regard to their health, their beauty, or their strength. The human constitution, as well as the taste, may be formed to various kinds of food. Many"], [100, "70 FOOD savage tribes on the sea coasts and in islands, subsist almost wholly on fish, and yet appear as strong and as active as those who who live by hunting and eat the flesh of various land animals. In many civilized countries, the lower classes subsist on diet that to an English man would appear ill calculated for the sup port of health and strength. The Norwegians frequently grind the bark of trees to mix with their oatmeal or barley bread; and yet are scarcely surpassed in health, strength, or longevity, by any people in Europe. The coolies or porters of Tunis, in Africa, who seldom eat any thing but bread and oil of olives, may fairly be ranked amongst the strongest men in the world. \" The strength and agility of these coolies,\" says a late travel ler, \"are almost incredible: having a great many ships to load, we employed several of these people, and have frequently seen one of them carry a load which weighed half a ton, English weight, a distance of thirty or forty yards.*\" This is certainly an exertion of strength which few men in Great Britain are able to make. The same writer in describing the manners and depicting the character of the Arabs of Bussora and its vicinity says, \" That their diet consists chiefly of bread, water, and * Jackson's Journey from India, p. 65."], [101, "FOOD 71 dates, and that, although their food is so simple, they have, generally speaking, twice the strength of Europeans.''* In this part of Mr. Jackson's narrative, we cannot avoid sus pecting some mistake or exaggeration, unless we suppose him to mean, that the Arabs, when compared with the Europeans, possess in a two-fold degree, the faculty of endurance under long continued fatigue; as it can scarcely be supposed, that they should be able to exert in a single onset, double the strength of an Englishman, Spaniard, or Italian. If, how ever, what he says of the coolies or porters of Tunis be correct, his assertion relative to the Arabs of Bussora, cannot be regarded as absolutely incredible. Whatever degree of credit may be attached to these facts, which Mr. Jackson relates as an ocular observer, we have the authority of several other travellers to shew, that the Arabs of Syria, Egypt, &c. although they are ex- tremely abstemious, subsisting on the most simple food, and using no other beverage than water, milk, coffee, or sherbert, are not defi- cient either in stature, strength, or activity. Hasselquist observes, that the Arabs of Egypt are of a middle stature, full of flesh, but not fat, with strong muscles, and a rough skin. -j\" * Jackson's Journey from India, p. 36. + Hasselquisl's Trav, p. 73."], [102, "72 FOOD And a celebrated French traveller says, that wherever he has seen the Arabs in Judea, in Egypt, and in Barbary, they appeared to be rather tall than short, well made, and active, with a haughty demeanour.* But after all that can be said concerning the beauty, the strength, and longevity of cer tain nations and tribes, who appear to be extremely abstemious, it is consistent with reason, and for the most part with observation and experience, that a moderately plentiful diet, without excess, is the most congenial to the human frame. A child that is pinched with hunger, says an eminent physician, will never become a strong or healthy man. -j- The nature of the body requires a certain portion of aliment for its support, and where that is deficient, health and vigour must decline.

Those of the Rajah or warrior cast, are allowed to eat animal food ; and they greatly surpass the other Hindoos in strength as well as in courage.

When we contemplate the various characters and dispositions not of individuals only, but also of numerous collections of men, living under the same climate, and nourished by the same kind of food, we are sometimes unable to discover any such difference in their govern ment, laws or religion, or other moral circum-"], [106, "76 RACE stances, as can account in a satisfactory man- ner for so marked a distinction. In such cases, are we not tempted to believe, that something more than is generally supposed, may be attri- buted to race ? Reason and revelation concur in representing the whole human species as issuing from the same stock ; but experience shews, that families are often distinguished not only by certain peculiarities of external organization, but also by particular disposi- tions of mind, which prevail through all or the greater part of their branches. On the con- trary it sometimes happens, that one or two individuals belonging to a family, differ greatly from the rest of its members in exterior ap- pearance as well as in disposition and intellect. While, therefore, the human species was com- posed of only a few families, some of the indi- viduals might be very different from the others, both in their bodily and mental faculties. It is neither impossible, nor extremely impro- bable, that the three sons of Noah might greatly differ in strength, courage, genius, and the other gifts of nature ; or such a difference might take place amongst the children of these patriarchs, or other parents and founders of tribes or colonies, and be perpetuated in num berless directions and ramifications. This view of the varieties of race among the. human species, is analogous to what is dis-"], [107, "RACE 77 coverable throughout the whole system of ani- mated nature. A late writer ascribes the dis- tinctive properties and perfection of animals solely to the breed, independent of climate and all other extraneous circumstances, and adduces in proof of his hypothesis the successful prac- tice of jockeys and sportsmen. \"The conse- quence,\" says he, \" of this kind of attention to breed, continued for ages is, that although the climate of Great Britain has never been deemed peculiarly favourable to the horse species, yet it is admitted, that in no part of Europe are horses bred that can equal those of this country, either in swiftness of foot or iu strength and perseverance of course. In Ara- bia, indeed, where this animal may be esteemed the chief support of the family, and where the very existence of the owner depends, on many occasions, on the powers of his horse, this cir- cumstance has obtained a still greater degree of attention than in Britain. The pedigree of a horse is there preserved with as great care as the genealogy of a royal family in Europe, and the interposition of the magistrate is called in upon every occasion of this sort to prevent frauds, and to authenticate the deed. In that country, it is not so much swiftness of foot that they regard, as the faculty of bearing fatigue and abstinence without being exhausted ; and this quality, they find runs in the blood, being"], [108, "78 RACE transmissible to the descendants of a race, which is known to possess it in an eminent degree, with as much certainty as any known quality whatever.

It is well known that the Merino sheep do not dege nerate in England ; and we are assured, on unquestionable authority, that they do not degenerate in France.* The most eminent breeders of cattle agree, that attention to race is the only effectual means that can be used for the improvement of stock, and the success of their practice proves the truth of their theory, f No one will attempt to deny that there exists an unquestionable analogy between the human frame and other animal bodies ; and it is also observable, that the same individual and family differences are seen among men as among brutes. Dr. Anderson pursues this analogy, and after remarking that the diversi ties among animals are infinitely numerous, and relate to the internal qualities, as well as to the form of the body and external appear ance, transfers his observations and theories to the human species. \" To this origin,\" says he, \" we must trace the well known phenome non of family likeness, and although this in the human species is wonderfully weakened * Bourgoanne's Trav. in Spain, chap. 3. + Witness the improvements made in the breeds, not only of horse? but also of horned cattle, sheep, &c. \u2022T"], [111, "RACE 81 among European nations by the law of con- sanguinity preventing marriages between per- sons who are near a kin, yet in spite of this, a family likeness and a family cast of character have been often known to prevail for several successive centuries.

And he adduces the case of the gipsies and the jews as an additional proof of the influence of race on the exterior appearance of the human species. But the gipsies can scarcely be considered at this day as a distinct race ; for although on their first appearance in Europe, they seemed to be a particular colony or tribe wholly different from any that inhabited this quarter of the globe, yet it is certain, that in process of time they have been joined by numbers of vagabonds in all the countries in which they they have been permitted to reside ;* and their singular manner of living, may have greatly contributed to give them that peculiar cast of countenance by which they may in general be recognized.

The jews are a numerous people, and extensively diffused over most of the countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa. They subsist, generally speaking, on the same kind of food as the other inhabitants of those countries; for the prohibitions contained in their law are not such as can have any effect on their stature, their features, or their com plexion. They follow a variety of professions and employments: many of them are wealthy merchants, having a fixed residence in popu lous and commercial cities : others, engaged in a great variety of inferior branches of traffic, lead a wandering life ; and in some countries, as Lithuania, Courland, &c. great numbers of them are agriculturists. Although they rigidly adhere to their peculiar institutions these re late wholly to religious matters: in all other respects they are subject to foreign governments and foreign laws, which are very different in the different countries where they are settled.

This characteristic distinction by which the jews are so easily recognized, can be ascribed only to their almost invariable custom of in termarrying among themselves, which preserves the race pure and unmixed. The justness of this conclusion appears from an indisputable circumstance; for it has constantly been observed, that whenever any of those people have become converts, and formed family alli ances with the nations among whom they are settled, the distinctive marks of their race are soon obliterated. A proof of the perpetuation of those characteristic distinctions, unless when effaced by mixture of breed, may be adduced from what a late traveller says of the Afghans, whose incursions and victories have rendered their names terrible in the annals of Hindostan, and whose princes sat a long time on the throne of Delhi. These people claim their descent from a Jewish stock, and had long been seated in Cash mire and the adjacent parts of Little Bocharia. Their numerous adven turers, who at different periods have opened a way with their swords into India and Persia, are mixed with the native inhabitants of those countries ; but in their original seats they still discover the distinctive marks of their race ; and Mr. Forster was so struck with the general"], [115, "RACE 85 appearance of the Cashmerians, as to be almost inclined to imagine that he had been suddenly transported amongst a nation of jews.* In almost every part of India, the different casts into which the people are divided, ex hibit in their external organization and appear ance certain peculiar characteristics.

The Bramins have taken up the sword and are seen in the ranks of an army : the Kettry, or warrior tribe, engage occasionally in traffic : and the Sooders have acquired principalities.

In this manner indeed, the Turks and Persians, both of whom appear to have been originally of a very dis agreeable exterior, have so greatly improved their race by their continual mixture, during a long succession of ages, with Circasian, Gre cian, and other slaves, that they are now the two handsomest nations of Asia, and little inferior in beauty to Europeans.* The reasonings of philosophy, the history of mankind, and the discoveries of the medical art, all concur to shew that various peculi arities in the human frame and constitution are transmissible by hereditary descent.

It is the opinion of several writers of emi- nence, that national character depends wholly on political constitution. The learned and ingenious author of the \"History of the Italian Republics of the Middle Ages,\" says, \"That the virtuesor the vices of nations, their energy or their effeminacy, their talents, their know- ledge, or their ignorance, are scarcely ever the effects of climate, or the attributes or endow- ments of a particular race, but the productions of the laws : that all things were given to all men by nature ; but that government either takes away from or guarantees to its subjects the common inheritanceof thehuman species.\"* After bidding us compare the state and cha- racter of the Italians in different periods of their history, he says* \" The same soil has nourished those beings so different in their nature ; and the same blood circulates in their veins.

Considering despotism as an effect of the supineness of a people, some writers of distinguished abilities conclude that it is the system of government natural to the climate. This opinion has found, from the celebrity of its author, Mon tesquiou, a considerable number of followers. The people of hot countries, say they, do not possess those energies, that activity and vigour of mind which in cooler climates prompt man kind to investigate their natural rights, and to maintain the balance of political freedom, all their inclinations are passive, indolence consti tutes their chief happiness, and they scarcely consider any punishment so severe as that exer tion of body and mind which is necessary for the vigour of human action.* The history of mankind, however, contro verts and confutes this theory ; for the inhabi tants of warm as well as of cold countries, have fought and bled for liberty and independence.

The same beautiful scenery adorns the prospects in Greece and Ionia as that which charmed the eye and the mind in those delightful countries twenty-two cen turies ago : the productions of their soil are still of the same kind ; and the same golden sunshine illumines their skies. Since the physical circumstances of these nations remains unchanged, the origin of the revolutions which have taken place in their genius and character, must be sought in the multiplied combinations of moral causes, the complicated results of political events and social institutions. Of these, government appears to be the most prompt and most powerful ; and some writers attribute \u2022 \" Londres jadis barbare est le centre des arts, \" Le magazin du monde et le temple de Mars.\" Voltaire Henriade. \" London, formerly barbarous, is the centre of the arts, \" The magazine of the world, and the temple of Mars.\""], [134, "104 GOVERNMENT. to its influence every circumstance in the state and destiny of nations. \" The more one sees,\" says an observing traveller, \" the more I believe we shall be led to think that there is but one all-powerful cause that instigates mankind, and that is government.

Families naturally grew up into tribes, held together by common consanguinity, and of which the head of the eldest family in each tribe was revered as the chief. When they were exposed to danger from foreign enemies, or induced by considerations of mutual advantage, two or more tribes united into one body, and composed a nation or state. In the new community, which generally formed a rude republic, some man of superior sagacity in council or superior prowess in war, never failed to gain the ascendant ; and when these qualities happened to be combined in the same person, he was not only intrusted with the command of the forces of the state, but took the lead in all public deliberations. With or without the forms of election, he was constitu ted chief magistrate and captain-general for life. A portion of the respect for the father was naturally transferred to the son. He usually possessed the same elevated station. With office, wealth and influence accumulated ; and the chief magistracy became hereditary."], [137, "107 GOVERNMENT. Thus was one family raised above others, and monarchy gradually formed.\"* From the nature of things, the patriarchal form of government could not be of long dura tion. In proportion as the number of indivi duals composing a tribe was augmented, the authority of its paternal chief would be gra dually weakened, and in a short time almost annihilated. Ambitious and enterprising men possessed of abilities and desirous of power, would aspire to the supreme authority, and then the progress of government would be such as Dr. Russell has described. The two grand sources of influence in society, are personal talents and property. While men were in the savage or even in the semi- barbarous state, personal strength and courage were the only talents held in esteem, and those which laid the foundation of all superiority. In the primeval ages these qualities were of the greatest utility, not only to clear the countries, where colonies were planted, from wild and ferocious animals, but to protect the peaceable part of mankind from plunderers and assassins, who abounded in consequence of the ineffi ciency of the laws, or the want of civil institu tions. \u2022 Russell's Hilt. And. Europe, vol. i.p. 35. &c."], [138, "108 GOVERNMENT. In process of time as men became more enlightened, mental qualifications were dis- covered to be not only useful, but absolutely necessary in those who aspired to rule over tribes and communities. A clear understand- ing and sound judgment were found to be as essentially requisite as bodily strength ; and the persons in whom these qualities were the most conspicuously united, would be naturally chosen as the head of the society, and the chief administrators of its affairs. But virtue and talents are not hereditary. In the natural course of things, therefore, the office of chief or leader would in every petty state at first be elective. But wealth may descend to a succes- sor ; and in the progress of society the in- fluence of property, gradually acquiring strength, soon overwhelms that of personal merit. This circumstance could not fail of giving rise to numerous disorders. Some would consider their superior talents as afford- ing a just claim to supremacy in power : others would regard their wealth or the share of the national property which they possessed, as entitling them to a superior influence in direct- ing the affairs of the state. In proportion as communities increased in wealth, population and territorial extent, civilization brought in her train, illumination of intellect ; the num ber of persons of merit as well as of persons of"], [139, "GOVERNMENT. 109 fortune was gradually augmented ; and as the supreme power began then to be surrounded with pomp and splendour, it became the most tempting object of ambition to those who could entertain any hopes of its attainment. This gave rise to innumerable factions, let loose the reins of ambition, involved nations in civil wars, caused perpetual revolutions of govern ments and dynasties, and introduced a train of convulsions which threatened the dissolu tion of civilized society. The picture here drawn is not merely imaginary : its original exists in human nature and social circum stances ; and history attests the truth of its resemblance. In order to remedy evils of so tremendous a magnitude and of so frequent recurrence, some expedient was necessary ; and none could be better calculated for the purpose than that of making the supreme power to descend in here ditary succession. The superior prerogative of birth, when it has obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion, is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among man kind. The acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction ; and the concioussecurity which it affords disarms the cruelty of the monarch.

In all countries the first legislative regula- tions must have been of a general nature and very concise. As communities advanced in civilization, they began to require a more expanded system of laws ; and governments at the same time gaining strength, the legisla- tors, desirous of confirming or extending their power, would take a wider survey of society, and a more exact aim in their political regula- tions. Accumulated experience, resulting from the incessant occurrence of novel circum- stances, would naturally extend their views ; and having too often before their eyes the dangers arising from a tumultuary and uncon- trolled state of society, they would set an exaggerated value on a system of rigorous coercion. Thus forgetting, or at least over- looking the evils that must arise from the de- struction of individual freedom, their grand object was to plan and carry into effect a scheme of permanent control and complete superintendence. In those early periods when nations were only emerging from barbarism to a state of semi-civilization, it was necessarv to"], [141, "GOVERNMENT. 111 watch with a jealous eye, and repress with a forcible hand, those tumultuary movements of popular licentiousness, from which society had much more to fear than from any restraints imposed by the governing power. These cir cumstances and considerations naturally led to the establishment of despotism. But as civilization advanced, the excess of control began to be unnecessary and to be felt as a grievance. In proportion as the human intel lect expanded, and men began to understand their natural rights and common interests, a more liberal system of legislation was intro duced. To attain this object, some communi ties changed the monarchical for a republican government, which often proved more tyranni cal than the regal power. One of the first and most necessary objects that attracted the attention of nations in their progress towards civilization, was the division of land. Until this took place, government could have little hold on the people. The possession and enjoyment of property bind the. affections of a civilized people to an improved country. Pastoral tribes wandering about through uncultivated regions could have none of those local attachments which arise from social circumstances, and attract the minds of men to their natal soil. The political union among members of the same community"], [142, "112 GOVERN 31 ENT. is rendered more close by an apprehension of danger from abroad, and the intercourse be tween them more general from a sense of mutual conveniency. Hence arose patriotism and internal traffic, the two great and original sources of civilization and national prosperity. Men acquired a peculiar affection for their native country and for their fellow citizens, soon after the division and appropriation of lands, in consequence of their common strug gles to defend their cultivated possessions against the ravages of barbarous and hostile neighbours.* The ancient legislators, there fore, wisely considered the division of lands as the parent of social order, in making each man the guardian of his own property, and the magistrate the guardian of all, by the regula tions which became necessary. \u25a0)\u2022 The time and particular manner in which the division and individual appropriation of lands took place in different countries, may be numbered amongst the things over which anti quity has thrown an impenetrable veil. The sacred writings give aluminous description of the manner in which the conquered country of Canaan was divided among the victorious Hebrews ; and profane history relates with * Russell's Hist.

But it does not appear that any of these were primitive divisions, unless we may suppose that until the building of Rome, the seven hills, and the marshy plains adjoining the Tiber, were waste and unappropriated grounds ; for scriptural history affords suffi cient evidence that the appropriation of the soil had taken place in Canaan long before the conquest of the country by the Israelites ; and there is no doubt that the lands of Laco nia were divided before the time of Lycurgus. That celebrated legislator divided them into thirty-nine thousand portions, according to the number of citizens, nine thousand of whom resided in the city of Laced\u00e6mon, and all the rest in the country. Romulus divided the Roman territory, which was then of a very small extent, among all the people, at the rate of two acres for each citizen. In fine, all the republics of antiquity were founded on agra rian laws, which, however, soon became ineffi cacious and obsolete. Amongst the ancient Germans the lands were public property, and the part to be ap propriated to tillage was annually determined in their national assemblies. They had no cities nor towns ; nor were their dwellings contiguous.

The distinction and power of the chiefs of ancient Germany consisted in being attended by numerous bands of chosen youth. They gained and preserved the favour of these re tainers by presents of armour and horses, generally the fruits of their predatory wars, and by the profuse though inelegant hospitality with which they entertained them. J Indeed they had nothing else to bestow, nor could those youthful warriors have any higher object of ambition, in a country where the soil was common property, and the luxuries of civilized life were unknown. But after the division and appropriation of the lands, the chiefs could bestow more sub stantial rewards on their followers. Lands were of no value unless they were cultivated, nor could the possession of them be secured * Tacit, de Morib. German, chap. 43. + Tacit, de Morib. German, chap. 44. $ Tacit, de Morib.

These considerations gave rise, in process of time, to the feudal system, with all its subdivisions and gradations. Theories are the least subject to error when they rest on the basis of^ facts ; and in morals as well as in physics, instructionis the most easily conveyed by example. In attempting, there fore, to estimate the influence of political systems, it is requisite to cast a slight glance at a few of the most celebrated governments of ancient and modern times, and to observe the effects which they produced on national cha racter and circumstances. Of the political systems of antiquity, those of Athens, Sparta, and Rome, are the best known, and possess the strongest claim to attention. In these famous ej republics, the powers of government Mere vested in the assembly of the citizens ; but a senate or supreme council of state planned and proposed every public measure. The senate of Athens, as established by Solon, was composed of four hundred members. But a few years before the first Persian war their number was increased to five hundred, viz. fifty from each of the ten tribes. At the same time the law of ostracism was enacted \u2014 a law by which the majority of the Athenians in the popular assembly could banish for ten years ; but without confiscation of property H 2"], [146, "116 GOVERNMENT. any powerful or ambitious citizen by writing his name upon shells, provided that the num ber of those on which his name was inscribed amounted to six thousand. When it was pro posed to banish any one by this law, his friends used to impeach some of his reputed enemies, in order to divide the votes and prevent the majority from amounting to the number re quired.* By this extraordinary law, which subjected persons to punishment without being guilty of any crime, many of the most virtuous citizens of Athens became the victims of politi cal jealousy, and were driven into exile through the machinations of their enemies or the caprice of the people. In Athens, the citizens, of whom the number appears to have never exceeded thirty-six thousand, were divided into classes according to the annual income of their estates. By this regulation, an open field was left for emulation and hope, as a citizen of an inferior class might by industry and frugality advance himself to the highest, and obtain all the offices and honours which it was entitled to claim. The senate examined and approved all measures before they could be proposed to the assembly of the people. But to the collective body of the Athenian citizens legally convened, be- * Plutarch Vita Aristid, and Vita Themist."], [147, "GOVERNMENT. 117 longed not only the right of electing and judging the magistrates and ministers who were intrusted for a limited time with the public authority, but also the power of ulti- mately deciding in all cases, legislative, execu- tive, and judicial, of contracting or dissolving alliances, of making war and of concluding peace. Such a political constitution, in which talents conferred the highest distinction, and popularity alone was the way to honour and power, afforded the most ample scope to emu- lation and to all the efforts of genius ; but at the same time it opened the doors to licentious- ness, corruption, ambition, and to almost e\\ery kind of disorder that can agitate a nation or community. The whole history. of this celebrated repub lic exhibits only one continued series of rash ness, folly, ingratitude, injustice, tumult, vio lence, and tyranny, and indeed of every species of wickedness that can be imagined. \" This,\" says an eminent British senator, \" is the city which banished Themistocles, forced into exile Miltiades, drove out Anaxagoras, and poisoned Socrates. This was the city that changed the form of its government with the moon : eternal conspiracies, daily revolutions : nothing fixed and established.\"* At Athens the most stu- Burke's Works, vol. 1, p. 51."], [148, "118 GOVERNMENT. died behaviour was not a sufficient guard for a man of great capacity. Some of the bravest Athenian commanders were obliged to fly their country, and some to enter into the service of its enemies rather than abide a popular deci sion on their conduct. That the political constitution of Athens was highly favourable to the developement of talents and to the improvement of the human mind, the number of her great men, and the proficiency in letters, in arts, and in arms, to which her citizens so rapidly attained, are in disputable evidences ; but its tendency to promote popular licentiousness is proved by their constant progress towards the most enormous excesses. The people, under no re straint, grew idle and dissolute. They re nounced all labour, and began to convert the public revenues to their own private use. They lost all concern for their common honour and safety, and could bear no advice that tended to a reformation. \" Truth became offensive to those lords, the people, and highly dangerous to the speaker. The orators no longer ascended the rostrum but to corrupt them still further with the most fulsome adula tion. These orators were all bribed by foreign princes, and devoted to their interest.

Spartans, and Macedonians, each of them sup ported by one or more demagogues pensioned and bribed to this iniquitous service.\"* A system so corrupt could not be of long duration. The Spartan constitution, as modelled by Lycurgus, was a mixture of monarchy, aristo cracy, and democracy, in which, however, the latter appears to have been the most prevalent. There were two kings who had the executive power. They were the first citizens of the state, the perpetual presidents of the senate, and commanders of the armies. f The senate was elective, and consisted of twenty-eight members. Nothing could come before the as sembly of the people which had not previously received the approbation of the senate, and no judgment of the senate was effectual without the sanction of the people. The senate alone, had the right of proposing and deliberating ou public measures : no debate of that kind could originate in the popular assemblies. But to the people belonged the power of discussing the measures proposed, and of ultimately ratify ing or negativing every resolution of the senate.

They convened and dissolved the popular assemblies, and could expel, imprison, or put to deith any obnoxious senator ; so that they possessed a power in some respects subordinate, in others superior to that of the kings.* The Athenian and Spartan governments rested on the same basis of popular power, except in the institution of the regal office, which, since the reign of Codrus, had never existed at Athens, and was indeed greatly checked at Laced\u00e6mon bv the authority and power of the ephori, who had the chief management of that dangerous engine, the people. But although the consti tutional basis of these two celebrated states was nearly the same, their laws were totally dif ferent, and gave an entirely different character to their citizens. Lycurgus appears to have had no other object in view than to form a community, in which every idea of private comfort and happi ness should be absorbed in the sentiment of public safety and glory. In order to maintain equality among the citizens, and to prevent the accumulation of private wealth, he prohi bited the use of gold and silver, and allowed iron money only to be coined ; and that luxu- * Xenophou ubi supra."], [151, "GOVERNMENT. 121 rious indulgence might not tempt to the acquisition of wealth, he ordered all the male citizens to eat at public tables : fifteen being joined in a mess, each contributing his quota to the common meal, which always consisted of the coarsest kind of victuals. He committed the labours of husbandry and the exercise of all mechanic arts solely to slaves, and per mitted the free citizens to follow no other profession than those of the magistracy and arms. He enjoined marriage as a duty; but none were allowed to marry before they had attained the full age of maturity, a regulation calculated to promote the production of a strong and healthy offspring. Women, like all other property, were held common in Sparta. Husbands were required, in certain circumstances, to lend their wives to others, when it was deemed necessary for the purpose of improving the breed. All children, as soon as they were born, were ordered to be brought to a public office to be examined by persons appointed for that purpose, and those that appeared to be deformed, feeble, or diseased, were thrown into a deep cavern ; but such as were well shaped, strong, and healthy, were delivered to nurses provided by the state. At seven years of age, the boys were placed under public preceptors, no Spartan being permitted to bring up or educate his own children. The"], [152, "122 GOVERNMENT. grand object of these preceptors was to render them bold, vigilant, and skilful warriors, to inspire them with a high sense of honour, a desire of applause and apprehension of dis grace, to inculcate a love of their country superior to every other consideration, and to mould their passions, sentiments, and ideas, to the genius of the constitution. It was not the male sex alone that was sub ject to this severe mode of training. The Laced\u00e6monian virgins, instead of . the seden tary employments of the needle, were obliged to occupy themselves like the young men, in running, wrestling, throwing the quoit or javelin, and other vigorous exercises. This obligation was imposed on the females in order .to give them a robust frame of body, and ren der them fit to produce strong and healthy children ; and these exercises they generally performed in a state of nudity, in order to add suppleness to strength, and to give vigour and tone to the fibres. No system of laws could be better calculated to inspire a contempt of effeminacy and to extinguish the apprehension of pain, than that of Lycurgus. On the annual celebration of a festival which he instituted in honour of Diana, all the Spartan boys were whipped till the blood ran down on the altar. This flagella tion was performed under the eye of the magis-"], [153, "GOVERNMENT. 123 trates of the city, and of the fathers and mothers, who exhorted their children to suffer the discipline inflicted without discovering any uneasy sensation.* The Spartan education and discipline could scarcely ever be said to cease. After twelve years of age, the boys, whose mode of life had already been extremely austere, were permitted to wear only one garment in winter as well as in summer. They were prohibited from sleep ing on any other beds but such as were made of reeds, and compelled to go barefooted at all seasons without any regard to the weather. As they approached manhood, their discipline increased in severity: their stated exercises scarcely left them a vacant hour in the day ; nor was there any remission of their toils but when they were called out into military ser vice. Then, indeed, so many indulgences were granted that the camp was considered as a scene of ease and luxury, an admirable device of the Spartan legislator to render war an object of desire rather than of apprehension to his citizens. The laws of Lycurgus also forbad them to fortify their city, lest a sense of security should diminish their vigilance. \u2022)- He also enjoined them not to undertake any naval war, which, by abolishing the use of the * Plutarch \\ it i Lycurgi. Pausanias lib. 3. + Plutarch Vita Lycurgi, Xenophon Repub. Lacon,"], [154, "124 GOVERNMENT. precious metals, he had rendered them ill qualified to support. He made it disgraceful to fly before an enemy however superior in force: so that in battle, death or victory was the lot of every Laced\u00e6monian, or a fate worse than death, perpetual infamy and exclusion from all offices and employments civil and military.* By this severe system of legislation, Lycur gus succeeded in forming a community of soldiers and patriots at the expense of all domestic and social enjoyments. The stability of their state was founfied on the misery of the individuals who composed it ; and Alcibiades, the Athenian, used to say, \" It is no wonder that the Laced\u00e6monians should advance fear less to battle ; for considering the hardships which they suffer under their rigid institutions at home, they may choose a glorious death in the field in exchange for such a life.'^-)- The influence of these institutions in forming the national character was visible. The Laced\u00e6 monians were a nation of statesmen and sol diers, a people, during many centuries, un- * The Spartan king Leonidas acted on this principle at the strait of Thermopyl\u00e6. He sent away his auxiliaries ; but declared it to be the duty of him and his Laced\u00e6monians to die rather than retire before the enemy. The Laced\u00e6monians, however, were sometimes defeated and ofrced to fly, viz. before the Messenians under Aristomenes. Pausan. lib. 4. the Thebans under Epaminondes, &c. + Elian. Var.

Laced\u00e6mon displayed none of those master-pieces of architecture, painting, and sculpture, which adorned Athens and the other cities of Greece. The axe and the saw were for a long time the only tools that were used in the timber work of the houses, and their furniture wasproportionably rude. The elegant arts were held in little esteem, and therefore neglected. Gymnastic exercises were the chief and almost the sole amusements of the citizens ; and the maxims of policy and war, which formed almost the whole circle of their literature, were among the Spartans the only objects of a liberal education.* In the time of Lycurgus, the Laced\u00e6monians were only emerging from barbarism, and his austere institutions had a strong tendency to check their further progress in civilization. From this cause it proceeded that they never became either a literary or a scientific people. None of those celebrated philosophers, poets, and orators, whose names have rendered Greece so illustrious, are found among the Laced\u00e6mo nians. Their oratory, the only branch of * Plutarch Vita Lycurgi. Xeoophon Repub. Lacor."], [156, "126 GOVERNMENT. literature which they could be said to cultivate* was remarked for its pointed application and sententious brevity ; but it displayed none of that dazzling eloquence which shone forth at Athens and afterwards at Rome. Without entering into further particulars, it may suffice to remark that, although Laced\u00e6mon was little more than a hundred miles distant from Athens, and nearly under the same degree of latitude, the national character of the Laced\u00e6 monians was as different from that of the Athenians as if they had formed each other's antipodes, a circumstance which shews the omnipotence of government and laws in form ing the minds and the manners of men. Although the design of Lycurgus was evi dently to render the Spartans a martial people, the institutions of that stern legislator were not calcalated to make them a great or a flourishing nation. By prohibiting the use of the precious metals, he prevented the intro duction of luxury ; but that regulation en tailed perpetual poverty on the state, and rendered commerce impossible. During the contests between Greece and Persia, the Lace d\u00e6monians were obliged to set aside the laws of Lycurgus relating to naval war, and under took several expeditions against Egypt and Asia ; but while his institutions remained in full force, they. could neither acquire wealth"], [157, "GOVERNMENT. 127 by commerce, nor extend their dominions by arms. The other Greek republics had a near re semblance to Athens in their political constitu tion. In everyone of them the whole govern ment was vested in the senate and the assembly of the people, the former to debate and the latter to decide. But these states possessed only a small extent of territory ; and being unable to defend themselves against the ambi tion of Sparta and Athens, they were generally drawn into the vortex of those two potent republics, and implicated in their contests and revolutions. Athens might be considered as the metropolis of Greece, the centre and principal seat of her literature, her science, her arts and refinement. Rome was at first a monarchy and afterwards a republic. But the Roman kings were never despotic : the senate, composed of a hundred members,* designated by the name of \" Cen tum Patres,\" was established by Romulus : the rights of the people were also defined ; and in the Roman monarchy may be traced several of the principles of the future republic. After the revolution which hurled Tarquin from his throne, the political system was new modelled, and a republican government established less * In the reign of Tarquiniss Priscus, the Roman senate was increased to 300 members."], [158, "128 GOVERNMENT. favourable to democratic licentiousness than that of Athens, but less restrictive to personal liberty, and less hostile to domestic happiness than that of Sparta. The political constitu tion of ROme contained a greater portion of aristocracy than any of the Grecian republics. The patrician families were distinguished from the plebeians by peculiar and important privi leges. The people had the right of electing their governors ; but the patricians alone were eligible to the highest offices of the state. These invidious distinctions and exclusive rights excited endless disputes between the patrician and plebeian parties ; but the latter continually gained ground ; and at length the government approached near to a democracy. The Roman republic, however, through all its changes and revolutions, preserved these essential features of the Grecian governments: the senate deliberated and proposed ; but the ultimate decision on all public measures be longed to the people. The history of the Romans is well known. After subduing the petty states of Italy, Rome became mistress of the world. Her destiny in this respect was widely different from those of Sparta and Athens, neither of which famous republics ever extended their dominions be yond the narrow limits of Greece and the islands and shores of the Egean sea. It has"], [159, "129 GOVERNMENT. been already observed that the narrow policy of Lycurgus in prohibiting the introduction of gold and silver and the practice of naval war had effectually prevented the aggrandizement of Sparta. Athens, although she produced heroes whose actions are immortalized in his tory : although the names of Miltiades, Themistocles, Aristides, Conon, Alcibiades, and many other celebrated commanders, em bellish her annals and shed lustre on her me mory, was less actuated by the spirit of con quest than the Roman republic appears to have been from the first ages of its existence. An ambitious aim at universal empire appears to have been instilled into the Romans at an early period ; and the pretended vision of Juliue Proculus, may, perhaps, have contributed to ex cite in them the expectation of ruling over the world, and which at that time was very distant and improbable. Romulus, the founder and first king of Rome, having disappeared during a violent thunder storm, assassinated, no doubt, by conspirators, it was deemed necessary, in order to calm the minds of the people, to decree his apotheosis, and pretend that he was taken up to heaven and placed among the gods. The story easily obtained credit among the semi-barbarian inhabitants of infant Rome, and was confirmed by another tale equally extragavant. Julius Proculus, a senator, and i"], [160, "130 GOVERNMENT. probably one of the persons concerned in the conspiracy, solemnly declared that Romulus suddenly descending from heaven presented himself before him, and gave him the following instructions : \u2014 \" Go/' said he, \" announce to the Romans that it is the will of the celestial powers, that my city of Rome shall be the capital of the universe. Henceforth let them cultivate the military art ; and set them know and teach their posterity that no human power shall be able to resist the Roman arms.\"* Such a story was calculated to make a deep impression on the minds of a superstitious and credulous multitude, who had been accustomed to admire the exploits of their martial king, and were now made to believe that he was enrolled among the gods, and from his celestial habitation superintended' their affairs. To complete the delusion, a temple was built to Romulus on the Quirinal hill: solemn rites were established to his honour : arcd from that time he was considered as one of the gods of Rome. After expelling their king Tarquinius Super bus, and abolishing monarchical government, the Romans instituted annual consuls, who, * Abi, inquit, nuncia Romanis, ccelestes ita velle ut mea Roma caput orbis terrarumsit: proinde rem militarem colant, sciantque et lta postens tradant, nullas opes humanas armis Romanis resistere posse.

This measure greatly contributed to the establishment of that belli- gerent system to which the republic invariably adhered during the whole period of its exis- tence. In the lives of monarchs there are, as Montesquiou observes, certain moments irt which their conduct maybe actuated by ambi- tion ; bat other passions succeed ; and some- times princes sink into indolence.* Of these changes history affords innumerable instances ; and indeed it is scarcely consistent with the order of nature that a long reign should dis- play, in every period of its duration, the same invariable spirit of enterprising activity. But the consuls of Rome being changed every year, the grand object of these temporary sovereigns was to signalize the short term of their adminis- tration by some splendid achievement ; and therefore not a moment was lost to the views and pursuits of ambition. They engaged the senate to propose new wars to the people and constantly pointed out new enemies. This belligerent system was not more agree able to the views of the consuls than to those of the senate. That body being constantly haras sed by the complaints and demands of the * Montesquoiu Grandeur et Decadence des Romains, chap. 1. p. 5, I 2"], [162, "132 GOVERNMENT. people, found it, if not absolutely necessary, at least highly expedient to have the citizens con stantly engaged in foreign wars, in order to di vert their attention from domestic grievances. War was also rendered agreeable to the people by the equal distribution of the spoils to the soldiers.* Those citizens who were not called out to actual service also enjoyed the fruits of victory. The conquered lands were divided into two parts, of which one was sold for the benefit of the public treasury, the other was distributed among the citizens under a rent charge to the republic's; Rome being for a long time without commerce and almost with out arts and manufactures, her citizens could acquire no wealth but by pillage. The con suls, not being entitled to the honours of a triumph until they had made a conquest or gained a victory, carried on their wars with extraordinary activity and irresistible impe tuosity. Rome was, therefore, by the princi ples of her government, in a state of violent and perpetual war, until she had subdued all those parts of the world that were thought worth the trouble of a conquest.

The Romans, during the early ages of the republic, delighted in war, and excelled most other nations in patriotism. They despised every idea of refinement as tending to effeminacy, and cultivated no arts but such as were of evident utility. As agriculture was useful and even necessary to the state as well as to indivi duals, it was considered by them as honourable; and a Roman senator or consul did not think it beneath his dignity to put his hand to the plough. But the sciences that were held in the highest esteem, were those which could be rendered subservient to the purposes of war and government. The study of eloquence and tactics constituted the whole of a liberal educa tion ; and in these some degree of proficiency was indispensable to every citizen who aspired to the consulate or to the other offices of the republic. It is highly necessary that the rulers of states and communities should acquire the art of making strong impressions on the minds of the people : by these means the imagination is roused and kept in action. The statesman who can at all times direct public opinion, may boast of having found the point which Archimedes required to enable him to move"], [164, "134 GOVERNMENT. the earth. No politicians were ever more sensible of this than the rulers of Rome ; and none were ever more successful in forming the public mind. The Roman character had per haps less, of individuality than that of any other people, unless we may except the Laced\u00e6 modians : it was an uniform model to which all their eminent men adapted their particular dispositions; and their moral writers always presented the same examples.* The magnifi cent sounds of \" eternal Rome/' and \" the majesty of the Roman people,\" which their orators constantly rung in the ears of the citi zens; acted as a magiospell on their minds, and inspired them with lofty ideas. An insatiable thirst of military glory, an extravagant confi dence in their own force, an insolent contempt of their enemies, and an unbounded ambition of extending their empire, formed the distin guishing traits of the Roman character. The changes which took place in the govern ment of these celebrated republics, and the events that occur in their history, produced corresponding revolutions in the character as well as the circumstances of their citizens. The age of Themistocles, Conon, &c. was the \u00e6ra of the greatest external power and gran deur of Athens : the age of Pericles was that of V Mad. dc Stael de la Literal, torn.

She held the lesser states, which she called her allies, in a state of complete subor- dination, and lavished theirsubsidies, bestowed for the national defence, in magnificent build- ings, games, and festivals. The allied or rather tributary states complained ; but Lace- d\u00e6mon was the only power that dared to resist the domineering republic of Athens ; and the Peloponesan war was the consequence. This. contest, so fatal to the independence of Greece, terminated in the capture of Athens by Lysan- der, and the complete humiliation of that famous republic. The Athenians submitted so far as to demolish- their port, to limit their fleet to twelve ships, and to engage to under- take no military enterprise without the sanc- tion of the Laced\u00e6monians. That lofty and patriotic enthusiasm which had been so remark- able amongst the Greeks, was now greatly weakened and almost extinct. Their divisions proved fatal to their national independence. Athens became the ally of Persia : the influence of Persian gold excited a general confederacy of the Grecian states against the Laced\u00e6mo- nians, and rendered the power of Artaxerxes Mnemon almost as uncontrollable in Greece as in his own dominions. After the conquest of"], [166, "136 GOVERNMENT. their city by Lysander, and their political humiliation, the Athenians seemed to have lost their enterprising spirit. The pleasures of luxury, introduced by Persian gold, sup planted the ardour of heroism. Poets, mu sicians, sculptors, and comedians were now almost the only great men of Attica. The Athenian orators and popular leaders were for the most part pensioners of Persia ; and that sublime patriotism which had formerly shone so bright in the Grecian character, had now given way to considerations of private interest. Corruption reigned in all the Grecian states, and they continued to weaken one another by their divisions, till Philip, king of Macedonia, a country which before his reign had been little known or noticed, but by the active and crafty genius of that prince had become im portant and powerful, put an end to their independence. When their public virtue was lost, their popular governments only served to favour the licentiousness of the multitude and the corruption of their demagouges. The principal orators in most of their states were bribed into the service of Philip ; and all the eloquence of Demosthenes, aided by his incor ruptible patriotism, was unequal to the mean but more seductive arts of his opponents, who by flattering the people gained their affections. The victory of Ch\u00e6ronea rendered Philip"], [167, "GOVERNMENT. 137 the master of Greece ; but this conquest did not depend on the issue of a battle. That politic prince had so deeply laid his scheme, and by bribery and intrigues had gained such a number of considerable persons in the dif ferent states that, according to his own expres sion, without the victory of C\u00e6ronea the course of another day would have put him in possession of the sovereignty of Greece. Thus terminated the liberty and indepen- dence of the Greeks, whose brilliant achieve- ments and intellectual attainments form one of the most splendid pictures that history exhibits. Under Alexander the Great and his successors they were sometimes in a state ap- proaching to slavery, and sometimes enjoyed a temporary liberty. At length they called in the Romans to assist them against the Macedo- nians ; but finding that in these allies they had only given themselves new masters, they endeavoured to correct their imprudence by a folly of still greater magnitude. They called in Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, to assist them in expelling the Romans. The aid which they received from Antiochus was feeble and ineffectual, and only afforded to the Romans a specious pretext for their subjugation. Athens, Sparta, and all the celebrated states of Greece sunk into the indiscriminate mass of nations that acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome,"], [168, "138 GOVERNMENT. and never more enjoyed an independent existence. Athens and some of the other Grecian cities, although they nO longer figured in arms, were still conspicuous and celebrated as, schools of literature and science ; and the Greeks had the glory of instructing their conquerors in philo sophy and the arts of refinement. But in process of time they lost this honourable dis tinction, and sunk into a state of intellectual as well as political degradation. Confounded with the Romans, or rather with the assem blage of nations assuming that name, they constituted a part of that corrupt and de generate empire, to which historians have given the various appellations of Greek, Eastern, and Byzantine, but which continued to stile itself Roman, till the capture of Con stantinople by the Turks put a period to its existence, and reduced the people to the most degrading state of subjection. In this sketch, the mental eye casts a rapid glance over more than eighteen centuries in which the Grecian character is seen in a state of constant and for the most part increasing degeneracy, owing to political revolutions and the changes in government. While the Greeks possessed liberty and independence, their courage and genius were the subjects of univer sal admiration ; and even so long as they"], [169, "139 GOVERNMENT. retained the shadow of freedom, they com manded, by their arts and their literature, the respect and esteem of mankind. But under the disorderly despotism of the court of Con stantinople, they were constantly declining towards a state of moral degradation and men tal imbecillity. We cannot read the history of the Byzantine empire, compiled by its native writers, nor contemplate its picture, as drawn by the genius and judgment of Montesquiou, without beholding a government weak, un stable, and tyrannical, a people bigotted and immoral, the slaves of a puerile imagination.* This degeneraoy of the Greeks can be ascribed only to moral causes, as their physical circumstances remained without any altera tion It may, says an eminent writer, be true that the Greeks are not physically degenerated, and that Constantinople contained, on the day when it changed masters, as many men of six feet and upwards as in the hour of its pros perity ; but ancient history and modern poli tics instruct us, that something more than physical perfection is necessary to preserve a slate in vigour and independence; and the Greeks in particular are a melancholy ex ample of the near connexion between moral * For a lively description of the disorders aud weakness of the Eastern empire, see Monlesquiou Grandeur and Decadence des Romains, chap. 21\u201422."], [170, "140 GOVERNMENT. degradation and national decay .\"* From the whole history of the Greeks, during the long period of their decline, it evidently appears that the vices and tyranny of the government destroyed the virtues and depressed the genius of the people, whose degeneracy, by a kind of re-action, caused the downfal of the empire. The political degradation in which the Greeks have, during more than three centuries and a half, been held by the Turks, has com pleted the moral and intellectual degeneracy of their character ; and the glories of their ances tors only serve to render their vices more pro minent. Had we not been early taught to ad mire Grecian courage, wisdom, and talents, we might look upon the meanness of the present race with less emotion. But who can think without regret that the descendants of the conquerors of Marathon are cowards and slaves. \" The Greeks of the present day,\" says a modern traveller, \" present, in their moral cha racter, the same spectacle as that of a man to whom heaven has granted the doubtful blessing of a very long life.

Few among them are deformed or ugly : on the contrary those of the Morea and the western isles of the Archipelago are in general of a remarkably athletic frame, with broad shoulders and strong necks, while those of Constantinople, the coasts of Asia Minor, and the other islands, compensate by the ele gance of their form what seems to be deficient in its strength. Their countenances are ex pressive ; but slavery is strongly marked in every feature. It appears, however, that notwithstanding their present degradation, a favourable change of circumstances might restore to the Greeks their original character. They are even at this day the pirates of the Levant and the best seamen and marines in the Ottoman service. Even Turkish oppression cannot entirely de stroy the natural cheerfulness of their disposi tion. In the taverns, where they frequently drink to the greatest excess, they are generally * Semple's Trav. rol. 8. chap. 9."], [172, "142 GOVERNMENT. seen dancing to music, of Which they are ex- ceedingly fond.* Their vices perhaps have been exaggerated : but how great soever they may be, they are such as always originate from slavery. \" Their life,'* says Lord Byron, \" is a perpetual struggle against truth : they are vicious in their own defence.

'They are ungrateful notoriously ungrateful !' \u2014 this is the general cry. Now in the name of Nemesis ! for what are they to be grateful ? Where is the human being that ever conferred a benefit on Greek or Greeks ? They are to be grateful to the Turks for their fetters, and to the Franks for their broken promises and lying counsels.

These vices are every where the productions of tyranny, which extinguishes in those whom it oppresses every noble and generous sentiment and every manly virtue. A writer, who appears to be a panegyrist of the Greeks, attributes their former progress in poetry and the fine arts, in the first place, to nature, and then to the system of government as the secondary cause. He sa}'s \" That nature alone produced the poets and musicians, the painters and sculptors of ancient Greece.\" But after this positive assertion, that all the men of genius, whose works raised that celebra ted country to so high a pitch of glory and renown, owed every thing to nature, he adds, \" That a lively imagination, an active spirit, a fine organization, a delicate taste, or rather exquisite sensibility, assisted by a clear sky, by the prospect of a most beautiful country, and by a government the best adapted to ex tend, display, and aggrandize the genius of man, which, without the blessings of liberty, can never act with its true force : these are the advantages that nature so bountifully be stowed on the Greeks.\"* They had nothing to do but to turn towards the objects she pre sented, and exercise the talents she gave them : * M. de Guy's Sentimental Jonrney, vol. 3. p. 9. &c.

Possessing a taste formed by the habitude of seeing and producing the most beautiful things, the empire of the arts insensibily established itself: the ambition of the people centered in a desire to promote that empire, and to establish the glory of their country.* \" But,\" says M. de Guy, \" if genius is to be considered as the father of the arts, liberty certainly deserves to rank as their mother: cherished in her bosom, they flourished : but abandoned by this softer parent, they fled from conquered, ruined Greece.\" The arts have experienced the same fate in all countries. The Etruscans, who once seemed to rival the Greeks in taste and refinement, no sooner fell under the Roman power, than their genius disappeared and they sunk into barbarism. It appears, therefore, from numerous instances, and especially from the case of the Greeks, that moral causes, infinitely more than physi cal circumstances, influence national character, since arts, sciences, and letters now flourish on the cold and foggy shores of the Baltic sea and the German ocean, while during a period of several centuries not a single poet or philoso pher has arisen in the country of Homer and Plato. * M. de Guy ubi supra,"], [175, "145 GOVERNMENT.

Internal corruption proved equally fatal to the freedom of Athens and Rome ; but the former as well as all Greece fell under a foreign domination, the latter saw her republi can government subverted, and her liberties extinguished by the ambition of a few over grown citizens.

The conquest of Greece and Asia caused a prodigious influx of wealth, which brought in a deluge of luxury incom patible with the existence of a popular govern ment. Several of the Roman citizens acquired princely fortunes, while the greater number were oppressed by poverty. Such a state of society was quite the reverse of that equality which forms the basis and the very essence of the democratical system. While Rome was extending her dominions on every side, two hostile factions, coeval with the republic, existed within her walls. The invidious distinction of patricians and ple beians has already been noticed ; and their reiterated contests are well known to all who are conversant with Roman history. This disorganizing circumstance in the constitution has, by many writers, been considered as one of the radical causes of the dissolution of the republican government. Montesquiou, how ever, is of a different opinion, and considers those divisions as of a salutary nature and even necessary to the system ; for, as he very justly observes, the Romans who were such haughty, audacious, and terrible warriors abroad, could scarcely be remarkable for moderation at home.* * MoMcju,.

K 2"], [178, "148 GOVERNMENT. t It is the decided opinion of this eminent political writer, that the too great extension of the republic, which changed the popular tumults into civil wars, was the sole cause of its dissolution. As long as the domination of Rome was confined within the boundaries of Italy, the republican government might easily subsist. Every soldier was a citizen : the num ber of troops was not excessive ; and no person was received into the army who did not possess property sufficient to give him an interest in the conservation of the city and the support of the republic, while the senate had the near in spection of the conduct of the generals. But after the legions had passed the Alps and the sea, the soldiers being stationed for a long time in the countries which they had conquered, gradually and almost imperceptibly lost the spirit and sentiments of citizens, while the military commanders, who had armies and kingdoms at their disposal, grew sensible of their own strength and disdained control. The soldiers began to acknowledge no authority but that of their general. They were no longer the soldiers of the republic, but those of Sylla, of Marius, of Pompey, or of C\u00e6sar.* And Rome could no longer be certain whether * Montesquiou Grandeur et Decadence des Romaics, chap. 9. p. 78."], [179, "GOVERNMENT, 149 the commander of an army in one of her pro- vinces was her protector or her enemy. The extension of the freedom of the city contributed also in no small degree to the sub version of the republic. Rome having achieved so many conquests by the help of the people of Italy, granted to some of them the privilege of citizens. Her refusal of the same favour to others gave rise to the social war, one of the most dangerous in which she had ever en gaged.* The result was, that she granted the privilege of citizenship, in the first place, to such of her allies as had distinguished them selves by their fidelity and attachment during the contest, and afterwards to all the Italians. The political aspect of Rome was now entirely changed. It was no longer that city where all the people were animated by the same spirit, by the same love of liberty, and the same hatred of tyranny. All the people of Italy having now become its citizens, each city brought thither its genius, its particular interests, and its dependance on some power- ful protector. Ambitious demagogues brought to Rome the people of whole cities and pro vinces to attend the popular assemblies, in order to procure a majority of votes at the elections and on the discussion of public * Appian.

A seditious multitude, collected from all parts of Italy, assumed the name of Comiti\u00e6 ; and the authority of the people, its laws, and even the Roman people itself, were now only a chimera. Such, indeed, was the anarchy introduced by this extension of the freedom of the city, and the consequent influx of voters and clients, that it could scarcely any longer be known what was or was not decreed by the people.* The city no longer formed one united and harmonizing whole.

It has been observed that the narrow policy of preserving, without any foreign mixture, the pure blood of their citizens, checked the fortune and hastened the downfal of Athens and Sparta.

In fact, these two famous re publics consisted each of a handful of freemen amidst a nation of strangers and slaves. In regard to the privilege of citizenship the con duct of the Romans was widely different. Their aspiring genius sacrificed private vanity to public ambition ; and they deemed it pru dent as well as honourable to adopt as com patriots the enemies whom they had conquered. In the infancy of Rome this liberal policy was of great advantage to her interests : it was adopted by Romulus, her founder, and con tinued under the regal and afterwards under the republican government. Notwithstanding the incessant demands of war and colonies, the citizens, who in the first census of Servius Tullius amounted to no more than eighty three thousand, were, before the commence ment of the social war, multiplied to the num ber of four hundred and sixty-three thousand * Herodot. lib. 5. chap. 97. Athenceus lib. 6. p. 179. + Plutarch Vita Lycurgi, VitaAgls, Vita Cleom."], [182, "152 GOVERNMENT. men capable of bearing arms.* But there are certain limits where every political measure ought to stop. The liberal communication of the freedom of the city, which in the early lages of Rome was so conducive to her aggran dizement, when extended to all the people of Italy, plunged her into anarchy, and extin guished that enthusiastic spirit of patriotism which had been the source of her great achievements, and the cause of her high ex altation. If, therefore, the narrow policy of Athens and Sparta, in regard to the right of citizenship, contributed to prevent their aggran dizement, an opposite conduct was equally detrimental to Rome, a circumstance which shews the danger of extremes in political measures, especially in a republic. The exoribitant aggrandizement of Rome, and the too great extension of her civil privi leges, maybe considered as the Original sources of those complicated evils which extinguished her liberties and subverted the republican government. Her vast conquests had intro* duced a display of luxury scarcely equalled in any age or country, and accompanied by a corresponding degree of corruption. Avarice and prodigality, these two seemingly unnatural but not unusual companions, succeeded to * M. de Beaufort Repub. Rom. liv. 6. chap. t."], [183, "153 GOVERNMENT. that disinterestedness and frugality which had formerly distinguished the Roman character. A variety of other causes flowing from these sources appeared as the most conspicuous agents in the destruction of the republican system. The civil wars between Marius and Sylla had learned the Roman soldiers to embrue their hands in the blood of their fellow citizens. But the tyrannical and iniquitous system of proscriptions which these two rival chiefs introduced, was the source of still greater evils. It became dangerous to adhere to the cause of liberty ; for when two ambitious citizens contended for the supreme power, it was necessary to follow the fortunes of one or the other, as those who remained neuter were almost certain of being proscribed by the victor. The Roman affairs were now in such a state that the republican government could not long exist, and it is absurd to accuse the ambition of particular persons as the cause of its fall. That revolution must rather be ascribed to a combination of causes which had long been operating; for as Rome was then circumstanced, if C\u00e6sar and Pompey had adopted the conduct of Cato, Others would have acted the part of C\u00e6sar and Pompey ; and the republic would have been overturned by some other hands. Notwithstanding the unparalleled luxury jvhich existed in Rome, and the disorders that"], [184, "154 GOVERNMENT. convulsed the republic, the Romans had not lost all the great qualities by which they had so long being distinguished. One of the fun damental laws of the state, established by Romulus, and confirmed by the republican government, permitted to the free citizens the exercise of only two sorts of employment, agriculture and war. This law appears to have greatly contributed to form the genius and particular turn of mind of the Romans. They despised commerce and the arts as the occu pations of slaves, and regarded the exercise of them as disgraceful to freemen. If there were any exceptions to this general mode of think ing, they were found among the affranchised slaves, who preserved their former habits of industry. But the generality of the Roman citizens knew only the arts of war and elo quence, which alone opened the way to the offices and honours of the republic. The force of these institutions with the habits of life, to which they had given rise, had made such impressions on the minds of the Romans, that in the midst of riches and luxury they were still distinguished by the most heroic valour and the most assiduous application to the study and practice of war,* a circumstance * Montesquiou says he believes that this has never happened to any other nation.

From the slight sketch that has here been given of the most famous republics of antiquity, we cannot but see that the constitution of Sparta was a monstrous and singular species of tyranny, in direct and constant hostility with every principle of human happiness. But it was admirably calculated to mould the minds and the manners of the people to a particular standard of patriotism, by extin guishing every idea of private consideration and every sentiment of domestic affection. The necessary effects of so restrictive a system was such as might be supposed : a Spartan was a being not only different from all the other Greeks, but also from the men of all other nations. Brave and politic, but austere, cruel, and inflexible, he seemed to have divested himself of the common feelings of human nature : the commonwealth was the grand object that was ever in his eye : nothing of an individual nature was deemed worthy of his attention. Athens, free from the austere restrictions of Sparta, but not less ambitions of glory, im- yet neither the English nor French have in the least degenerated from their martial character."], [186, "156 GOVERNMENT. impressed on her citizens a totally different character. Her free constitution, which soon became a licentious and turbulent democracy, gave an ample scope to individual inclination, exertion and taste. The excess of freedom, although it gave rise to an infinity of evils, was also productive of incalculable good. The Athenians being left to their own inclinations, sought honour and applause by all the various means that could present themselves to a great number of aspiring and ingenious minds. Letters and arts were cultivated as well as the science of arms ; and Athens became the in structress of mankind as well as the admiration of the universe. Rome, during the purer ages of the republic, exhibited, in regard to her institutions, a medium between Athens and Sparta. Her political system, founded on principles less loose and disorganizing than those of the former, but far more liberal than those of the latter government, gave a corresponding tint to the character of her citizens. Until the end of the punic wars, the Romans displayed more of the Laced\u00e6monian than of the Athenian character. But after the destruction of Car thage and the conquest of Greece, Asia Minor and Syria, the Roman character losing every tincture of Spartan austerity, began to take more of the Athenian colouring."], [187, "157 GOVERNMENT. An elegant writer asserts, that \" One pre- dominant virtue sustains all political associa- tions, independently of the principle of govern- ment, that amongst all the different qualities one is preferred, without which all the rest are as nothing, and which alone suffices to excuse the absence of them all. This quality is the patriotic tie, the distinctive character of the citizens of one common country. Among the Laced\u00e6monians, it was the contempt of physical pain: among the Athenians, the dis- tinction of talents : among the Romans, the power of the mind over its passions and affec- tions.\"* These national characteristics, how- ever, are far from being independent of the prin- ciple of government, that, indeed, being the source from which they generally originate. But distinctive characters are chiefly formed by republican governments, where every citizen considers himself as an important member of the state, and therefore conforms his views, his habits, his ideas, and tastes to its peculiar institutions and even to its established pre judices.

A democratical government like that of Athens, and, indeed, any government which like the famous republics of antiquity, refers all the ultimate decisions to a popular assem bly instead of a body of representatives, is irrational in theory and pernicious in practice. It gives to ignorance the superiority over knowledge : to uncultivated intellect, the di rection of intelligence: and to follv, the governance of reason and sagacity. Intelli gence, information, learning, and wisdom ought to govern nations ; and these will always be found to reside chiefly amongst the middle and superior classes, whose habits of thinking are more correct than those of the vulgar. The republican system, however, is extremely favourable to the developement of talents and genius. In a republic like that of Athens, the market of public employment, of honour, and dignity, is open to all : it is consequently crowded with competitors ; and each candi date is obliged to exert all the faculties of his mind, and to call forth all his talents and energy. Hence that activity of mind, that fermentation of intellect and imagination which produces genius and creates the poet and the orator, the statesman, the sage, and the hero. But under despotic governments, the administration being confined to the"], [189, "GOVERNMENT. 159 monarch and his ministers, the whole body of the people is excluded from all influence in national affairs. In every free country, whether republic or monarchy, mental improvement frequently opens the way to fortune and fame, to rank and consideration. It is therefore necessary to every individual who wishes to attain or keep a place in the higher orders of society. A despotic government, on the con trary, presents no motives to intellectual exertion ; and all energy of mind evaporates under its baleful influence. This appears to have been the case with many of the oriental nations. The Hindoos, there is every reason to believe, were ac quainted with the ornamental arts long before the \u00e6ra of European civilization ; but they have been in a retrogade state more than twenty centuries. Mr. Forster says, that \" Iti some ruins near Kurrah, Mannickpour, and in the vicinity of Benares, there are now to be seen mutilated fragments of sculpture, which, for the simple elegance of the design as well as the exact nicety of the execution, may, in his opinion, vie with the works of European masters.

The arts became retrogade in India, and works of genius were unknown : because the artisans being ill treated and ill paid, could find no encouragement for their industry. Under the Mogul government, an Omrah could send for an artizan and compel him to perform a piece of work on such terms as he pleased to grant. The best artists of the east were retained in the courts of the princes and great men ; but there genius pined, and was checked in the bud by the terrors of despotic power.

If these two essentials are wanting, there is an end to all individual and national energy ; and such is in general the condition of the orientals. A theory may be generally true and yet fail in some particular cases. Despotism is in its nature descructive of mental energy ; but, even in this respect, much depends on the abilities and disposition of the monarch. The litera ture of the Romans suffered no detriment by the destruction of freedom : it only took a dif ferent turn, and assumed a new character under the government of Augustus. While liberty was the animating principle of republican Rome, the study of rhetoric was an efficient instrument in the hands of ambition, and con sequently commanded more than all other literary pursuits, the attention of those whose talents entitled them to aspire to the offices and dignities of the state. But after the establish ment of an absolute monarchy, these high prizes were taken out of the lottery of life., and the primitive use of intellectual accom plishments no longer existed. But talents and ambition being excluded from the career of political activity, sought for distinction and glory by the cultivation of poetry as well as of philosophy and history. Augustus was a prince of a refined understanding, and while h 2"], [194, "164 GOVERNMENT. he exercised an uncontrolled authority, under republican forms, with a mildness that scarcely excited in the people any sensation of despo tism, he distinguished himself as the patron of letters. His example was followed by M\u0153c\u0153 nas and other illustrious personages. The imperial court became the rendezvous of the Roman literati; and the reign of Augustus obtained a lasting celebrity by developing the genius and patronizing the labours of Livy and Virgil. The Arabian caliphate was a despotic monarchy : but the government of the succes sors of Mahomed was in general rational and mild. After their arms had carried slaughter and devastation over extensive countries, and their conquests formed one of the most power ful empires mentioned in history, the caliphs began to turn their attention to the encourage ment of science and letters. The genius of their subjects was awakened by the prospect of splendid rewards. Schools were opened at Bagdad, Cusa, Bassora, and many other places; and the arts and sciences were encouraged with a muhifience which reflected the highest honour on their patrons ; nor was the laudable attempt to revive the arts \"confind to the pre cincts of the court of Bagdad : it was commu nicated to the Arabians in Syria, Africa, and Spain ; and they may justly claim the honour"], [195, "GOVERNMENT. 165 of restoring letters and science both in Europe and Asia.* /* France, before the late revolution, was an absolute monarchy ; but arbitrary power was exercised in that kingdom with mildness, by a succession of humane and polished princes, who honoured learning and learned men with their esteem and encouragement. Arts, sciences, and letters were liberally patronized by the monarchs of France, and still more by their ministers. Descartes, Corneille, &c. rendered the reign of Louis XIII. illustrious. Racine, Bayle, and many others, were the ornaments of that of Louis XIV. Voltaire, Montesquiou, Fenclon, Fontenelle, D'Alem bert, and a crowd of distinguished writers adorned the age of Louis XV. In these suc cessive reigns, letters, arts, and sciences were protected and patronised by Richlieu, Colbert, and the regent Duke of Orleans, and more recently by the Due de Choiseul. Several other examples might be adduced both from ancient and modern history, of the advancement of literature and science under * To the Arabians \u00bbe are indebted for the cyphers or characters osed in arithmetic, and which so greatly facilitate its operations.

The protection and patronage of the Roman pon tiffs and other Italian princes, roused the genius of their subjects, and raised their talents to such a pitch, that in architecture, painting, and sculpture, modern Italy soon began to rival the glories of ancient Greece. And in the early part of the last century, Peter the Great, one of the most arbitrary monarchs that ever reigned in Europe, introduced the arts and sciences into Russia, and immortalized his name by promoting the civilization of his vast empire. But notwithstanding all the encouragement and support that despots can give, some branches of literature require the fostering hand of freedom to make them flourish, and without its genial influence must wither and die. The perfection of rhetoric is incompatible with subjection to an absolute monarch. The Roman senate subsisted until the subversion of the empire took place ; but under the emperors it was no longer an assembly of in dependent legislators ; and no instances of that commanding eloquence which shone with such peculiar lustre in the orations of Cicero, were produced even under the emperors of the Julian family and the Antonines. Some of these, particularly Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus"], [197, "GOVERNMENT. 167 Pius, and Marcus Aurelius, encouraged learn ing both by patronage and example ; yet the rhetorical genius of Rome sunk into the gulph of oblivion. Eloquence never revived ; and the purity of the latin language declined from the standard of the Augustan age. The fact is well known and the reason is obvious. Despotism excludes freedom of discussion, and leaves no safe or worthy end to be gained by fixing the principles and influencing the con duct of men. A free country is, therefore, the only soil congenial to eloquence : that noble science flourished at Athens while Athens was free, but vanished with the extinction of her liberties. At Rome it underwent the same fate. It has long been conspicuous in the British senate, being protected and fostered by a free constitution, while under the despotisms of Asia, its exercise and principles are equally unknown. But although absolute princes have always been unfriendly to eloquence, which requires freedom of thought and sentiment, they have generally been munificent patrons of archi tects, statuaries, and painters, and great en couragers of all the arts that contribute to magnificence. The courts of such princes are also favourable to polished manners, as the delicate disguises of the passions there become necessary. The Corinthians made their first"], [198, "168 GOVERNMENT. advances in elegance and refinement under their famous tyrant Periander. Athens dis plaved her greatest splendour under the domi nation of Pericles. Rome acquired her highest polish under Augustus ; and the most magni ficent structures that adorned the mistress of the world, were erected by the emperors. Despotism is favourable to those arts that are conducive to its splendour without being hostile to its authority. Extent of territory is one of these circum stances that have a decided influence in de termining the forms of political systems. Monarchical government is a natural and almost a constant effect of the union of ex tensive countries in one community. In a democratical republic, where the citizens ex ercise the powers of sovereignty, these powers will first be abused, and then lost, if they be committed to an unwieldy multitude. In extensive communities, each member feels his personal influence in the national system much less than the individuals of a small society. Each is, therefore, less solicitous about the concerns of the public, and more attentive to his own private interest. For that reason he more easily resigns those republican rights which he cannot exercise without considerable inconvenience, and devolves on a monarch the labour and care of governing the community."], [199, "169 GOVERNMENT. Every Roman, in the early period of the re- public, esteemed his political importance above all the wealth of the world, and all the enjoy- ments of life ; but when Rome had acquired a vast extent of dominion, and began lo indulge in luxury, individual ambition and avarice took place of public virtue. The name of a Roman citizen, at first a title of the highest dignity, being extended to all the people of Italy, became of less value, and the decay of public spirit, amidst jarring factions and the clashing of private interesss, converted the republic into a military monarchy. Such in our days has been the destiny of France ; and, indeed, no extensive and numerous community has ever been able to maintain, for any great length of time, a republican government. This may be regarded as a general position. The United Statesof America are of too recent a date to be adduced as an exception : we must wait to see the increase of population, the accumulation of wealth, and the influence of luxury, before we can calculate the effects which these powerful agents, joined to the efforts of individual ambition and other un foreseen causes, may produce beyond the Atlantic Monarchical government and extensive do minion may be classed among the political circumstances which the experience of the"], [200, "170 GOVERNMENT. ancient and modern world shews to be th\u00ab most favourable to public tranquillity. The history of human affairs affords scarcely any instance either of a powerful republic or of a country divided into a number of petty states, that was not a theatre of contention and almost incessant hostilities. Such was the primeval state of Greece.* Such was that of Italy until Roman power swallowed up all the smaller states into which that country was divided : England, while under the heptarchy, exhibited a similar spectacle : such, in fine, was the con dition of all the countries thus circumstanced, of which history has preserved any memorial. The same observation is applicable to every kingdom of Europe during the prevalence of the feudal system. The different districts of an extensive country, although nominally united in one monarchy, were yet in so ill connected a state, as to occasion almost the same confusion as would have arisen from so many independent governments. Before Wales and Scotland were united to England, the fer tile provinces adjoining to the Severn and the Tweed, now the abode of peace, plenty, and domestic felicity, continually presented scenes of danger, inquietude, carnage, and devasta tion. Even the polished republics and princi- * Plutarch Vita Thesei."], [201, "GOVERNMENT. 171 parities of Italy, in the middle ages, were con stantly harassed by their contests or their internal commotions. The republic of Florence swallowed up that of Pisa : Venice and Genoa were first jealous rivals, and afterwards impla cable enemies. Mantua and Milan, after being rent by successive factions, lost their republi can liberty : the former fell under the dominion of the family of Gonzaga, the latter under that of the tialeazo, and afterwards of the Viconti, while Padua, after seeing her government usurped by the Carrara family, became at length an appendage to Venice. The tranquil state of Italy, for near half a century previous to the French revolution, was owing to the awe in which the different princes of that country were held by their powerful neighbours, France, Spain, and Austria. The annals of all the Italian states are little more than the records of their contentions ; and to enumerate all the cases of a similar nature would be to write the early history of every known country. Extent of territory must be considered as a circumstance which, of all others, has perhaps the greatest tendency to tranquillize the world. The contests of petty states being carried on almost at the very doors of the citizens, mutual injuries often become a source of unextinguishable hatred and of personal enmity. But in wars between"], [202, "172 GOVERNMENT. great kingdoms or empires, the theatre of mili tary operations is generally near the borders ; and the extensive interior of each country ex periences .only\u00abin a slight degree the effects of hostility. ; It may here be objected, that too great an extent of dqminion has proved fatal to some of the. most celebrated empires. This circum stance, however, was not so much owing to extent as to want of consolidation. \" Exten sive conquests,\" says an eminent senator, \" sel dom or never produce any real advantage to the conquerors, especially when the solid secu rity of a very great and profitable although a limited possession is changed for the precarious tenure of an unbounded dominion, which does not pay you while you hold it ; nor does the advantage to be derived from such distant arid hazardous enterprizes tend to any thing else than to weaken the substantial resources of the state, and excite the exertion of a force which costs more in one year than the success of it will repay in many.\"* But it is to be observed, that these arguments are applied only to re mote possessions, separated from the parent state by almost one third of the circuit of the globe, and to attempts at conquest of which the success is hazardous and the advantage * Mr. Francis' speech on the Mahratta war, 1805."], [203, "173 GOVERNMENT. inadequate to the expence. It is only the union of a considerable extent of contiguous territory that can greatly contribute to the tranquillity of the world. The; noblest characteristic of a popular government is, that it favours mental exertion ; but it almost unavoidably produces licentious ness, turbulence, and disorder. Despotism checks the efforts of genius and industry ; but when exercised with justice and mildness, it tends to the preservation of tranquillity, and is1 not inconsistent 'with a very considerable degree of public happiness. When the adminis tration is in the hands of a tyrannical prince, it is frequently the cause of dreadful rebellions and bloody revolutions. The Asiatic despot, envelloped in solitary splendour, scarcely con siders his subjects as beings of the same nature as himself, until the spirit of the people being roused by oppression, some favourable coinci dence encourages them to erect the standard of revolt. It must, however, be observed, that in the strict sense of the word, no prince can be absolute, as no superiority of natural strength or acquired skill can enable one man to keep millions in subjection. In monarchies which are accounted the most despotic, such as Tur key, Morocco, Persia, and China, the power of the sovereign is checked by religion, ancient"], [204, "174 GOVERNMENT. customs, or public opinion. The authority of the Grand Seignior, the Persian monarch, and other Mahomedan princes, are under the con trol of the koran, which is a civil as well as a religious code, and cannot be grossly infringed by the sovereign, without exposing himself to the hazard of a general insurrection of the people. In the despotic monarchies in Europe, the abuses of the supreme authority are checked by the benevolent precepts of Christianity, the enlightened education of princes, the respect for public opinion, and the general principles of civilization. Where the obligations of reli gion are unknown or ineffectual, and public opinion is despised, the power of the monarch is circumscribed by that of the ministers and generals, to whom he is obliged to delegate a portion of his authority. In fine, the will of the most arbitrary monarch must be checked, and in some degree held in order by the obvious consideration that he is only one man amidst the millions of his subjects, and that all physical strength is on the side of the people. It would seem that monarchy, leaving a less degree of power in the hands of the citizens than they possess in a republic, and conse quently not bringing them into so close a con nexion with public affairs, must have a less decided influence in the formation of national"], [205, "OrOVERNMENT. 175 character. And, indeed, that uniformity of sentiments, views, and ideas which existed in the republics of Athens, Laced\u00e6mon, and Rome, especially the two latter, are seldom to be found in a monarchy. But it must be considered that the influence of both moral and physical causes are chiefly perceptible when they exist in the extreme. When they are intricately complicated, variously com- bined, counterbalancing and counteracting one another in an infinity of directions, as is often the case, their effects can be discovered and distinguished only by an accuracy of in- vestigation beyond the reach of the vulgar observer. From ancient history and modern observation, it appears that in monarchies the national character takes, in a great mea- sure, its colouring from the greater or less degree of liberty which the subjects possess. In Athens and Rome, when these states were governed by kings, the citizens enjoyed a great share of freedom, and consequently displayed many of those traits of character by which they were afterwards distinguished. Shades of difference, corresponding with the different degrees of liberty, may also at present be traced through all the monarchical governments now existing in the world, from the despotisms of Asia and Africa to the refined and excellent constitution of Great Britain."], [206, "176 GOVERNMENT.

De Guignes agrees with Barrow in his exhibitions of the Chinese character, and of the state of society amongst that celebrated people. He observes, that certain authors regard the Chinese government as a pattern of political and legislative perfection. But \" I have,\" says he, \" lived a long time in China : 1 have traversed this vast empire in its whole length : I have every where seen the strong oppress the weak ; and every person who pos sessed any portion of authority, making use of it to vex, harass, and crush the people.\"* Mr. Barrow also says, that \" A general charac ter of rapacity, of an aim to make himself master of the property of another by cheating, or thieving, or robbery, or the abuse of autho rity, distinguishes a Chinese whenever he can do it with impunity. ''-\\ It must, indeed, be confessed, that in conse quence of the jealous policy of the government, in not permitting foreigners to travel in China, our knowledge, both of the country and the people, is confined within narrow limits.

Although the immense population of China appears to be completely moulded to the views of the government, yet in an empire of so vast extent, the ambition of the great officers of the state in distant provinces might excite dangerous revolts. But occurrences of this nature are guarded against with the most cautious sagacity. The Chinese government is extremely jealous of any tumultuary move ment amongst the people, but still more of any tendency to the usurpation of power on the part of its remote delegates. The following extraordinary law shews the suspicious jealousy of the imperial court of Pekin respecting this matter. \" If any officer belonging to any of the departments of government or any private individual should address the emperor in praise of the virtues, abilities, or successful adminis tration of any of his majesty's confidential ministers of state, it is to be considered as an evidence of the existence of a treasonable com bination subversive of government, and shall therefore be investigated with the utmost strictness and accuracy : the cause and origin of these interested praises of persons high in rank and office being traced, the offending party shall suffer death by decapitation, after"], [213, "183 GOVERNMENT, remaining the usual time in prison.\u2014 His wives and children shall become slaves, and his pro perty shall be confiscated.\"* This singular exhibition of despotic jealously shews1 the ex cessive caution of the Chinese government in preventing the mandarins in the remote pro vinces of the empire from forming any con nexion with the people. Such a law cannot but tend to promote that system of tyranny and oppression so generally exercised by the provincial governors and public officers, as nothing is to be gained, but much to be lost by popular favour, which never fails to expose the possessor to the suspicion and resentment of the court. In every country, whether seini-barbarian or highly Civilized, the effects of one particular institution or law are often very conspicuous. Various circumstances tend to shew that the government and legislation of China have en entirely fashioned the character, the minds, and manners of its vast population. From the strict and regular order prevailing through every department of the state, and the great care that is taken to prevent, to repress, or to punish every thing tending to tuitiult or violence, the character of the Chinese has acquired an appearance of mih'ness, arid even * Sir Gco, Staunton's Translation, p.

Acts of inju- rious violence are, perhaps, less common and less to be apprehended in China than in most other countries; but compassion to the unfor- tunate, and kind assistance to those who are in distress, are scarcely to be expected. This unfeeling disposition of the Chinese is ascribed by Mr. Barrow to an absurd and singular law which ordains, that if a wounded man be taken into the charge of any person, even with a view to effect his recovery, and happen to die under his hands, the person into whose care he was last taken, is liable to be punished with death, unless he can produce undeniable evidence how the wound was made, or that he survived it the space of forty days. The eon- sequence of such a law is, that if a person happen to be mortally wounded by accident, or in an affray, he is suffered to die in the streets, from the fear, should any one take charge of him, of being made responsible for his death. \" A striking instance of the fatal effects of such a law,\" says Mr. Barrow, \" hap pened lately at Canton. A fire broke out in the suburbs, and three Chinese, in helping to extinguish it, had their limbs fractured and were otherwise dreadfully wounded by the falling of a wall.

The wounded Chinese were accordingly removed privately, and, no doubt, abandoned to their fate.\"* Mr. Barrow adduces various other instances of that unfeeling and hard hearted disposition which prevails among all classes of society in, China. One of the most remarkable circumstances of this great empire is, that the people, after a very early and considerable progress in all the arts of civilization, have, during the space of twenty centuries, made no further advance- * Barrow's Travels is China, p. 164, 4c."], [216, "186 GOVERNMENT. ment.* It is almost universally agreed, that of all the nations now existing in the world, the Chinese were among the first that attained to any considerable degree of refinment, and that they were civilized and enlightened to the same extent as at present more than two thousand years ago, at a period when all Europe, except Greece and Italy, might be regarded as barbarous ; but ever since that time they have been stationary and even in some respects retrogade. The history of this great empire, although immensely voluminous, is not sufficiently clear and authentic to develope the causes of this phenomenon ; for China has not, like Greece, lost her national existence, nor has she, like Italy, been broken into small principalities. The imperial suc cession in China has undergone various revo lutions ; but the empire, although sometimes violently agitated by internal commotions, has generally been in a state of progressive aggrandizement ; and even when conquered by the Manshurs, in the year 1644, its laws and institutions were adopted by the con querors. The Chinese were the instructors of * Although M. de Guignes' opinion may be right respecting the establishment of the Chinese empire, in its present extent, at so late a period as the 13th century, yet it is sufficiently proved that their great ptnio-.npher and legislator Confucius flourished four centuries before the christian era, and that China, although divided into several king doms, had then made a considerable progress in civilization."], [217, "GOVERNMENT. 187 the Tartars, as the Greeks formerly were of the Romans. In falling under the dominion of foreigners, they scarcely experienced any change, except that of the dynasty ; and from all that we can gather from their history, it does not appear that this revolution bad any prejudicial effects on their national character. The unprogressive state of the Chinese, in regard to the arts and sciences, cannot be be ascribed to any deficiency of genius. The same powers of intellect which carried them to a certain pitch of knowledge and civilization, would, unless counteracted by other causes, have carried them still further. The stupen dous canals, and other works of public and private utility, afford a convincing proof that the people of this empire do not want genius to plan nor dexterity to execute ; and it is uni versally acknowledged that they possess in an eminent degree the powers of imitation. Of this the gentlemen of the English embassy while at Yuen-min-yuen had the opportunity of observing some remarkable instances. \"The complicated glass lustres, consisting of several hundred pieces, were taken down piece by piece in the course of half an hour by two Chinese, who had never seen any thing of the 4tind before, and were put np again by them with equal facility ; yet Mr. Parker thought it necessary that the English inecbarjicjs should"], [218, "188 GOVERNMENT. attend several times at his warehouse, to see them taken down and again put together, in order to be able to manage the business on their arrival.\"* As another instance of their ingenuity, Mr. Barrow relates that a Chinese undertook to cut a slip of glass from a large curved piece, intended to cover the great dome of the planetarium, and immediately suc- ceeded, after the English artificers had broken three similar pieces in attempting to cut them with the diamond ; but the man performed this difficult task in secret, and could not be prevailed on to disclose the method by which it was accomplished. The same writer states it as a fact well known, that a Chinese in Canton, on being shewn an European watch, undertook to make one like it. and succeeded, although he had never before seen any thing of the kind, only it was necessary to furnish him with a mainspring ; and Mr. Barrow adds, that they now fabricate in Canton, as well as in London, and at one third of the expence, all those ingenious pieces of mechanism which at one time were sent to China in great quantities from the repositories of Coxe and Merlin. f It is evident therefore that it is not any defect of genius in the people of China, but solely the pride or policy \"of the government, in affecting. * Barrow's Trav. in China, p, 306, 307. t Barrow ubi supra."], [219, "GOVERNMENT. 189 to despise every thing new or foreign, and the general want of encouragement to new inven tions that have checked the progress of the arts and sciences in that celebrated empire. To the same political causes, seconded by certain physical circumstances, the contempt for foreign commerce, so conspicuous amongst, the Chinese, must undoubtedly be ascribed. It is one of the principles of the government to encourage, as little as possible, any intercourse between its subjects and foreigners ; and as it has fashioned the minds of the people to the model of its policy, they have imbibed a general contempt for foreign trade. The empire extending from the 20th to the 42 deg. of N. lat. enjoys a great variety of climate, and abounds in the productions both of the torrid and the temperate zone. In countries less ex- tensive or less favourably circumstanced, manufactures require the support of foreign trade, without which they could not flourish. But the great extent of China, the multitude of its inhabitants, the variety of climate and consequently of productions in its different provinces, and the easy communication by means of the numerous canals, render the home market capable of supporting very con- siderable manufactures.

In a cotrntry therefore of so vast an extent, and abounding in such a variety of pro ductions, the internal trade is equivalent to a \u25a0Very considerable foreign commerce, which therefore is far less necessary to the public welfare in China than in states Which are con frned within narrower limits, and comprise a less numerous population. The geographical position of China is also such as could have no tendency to excite a/ spirit of foreign com merce. Situated at' the eastern extremity of Asia, arid bounded on the west by countries producing nearly the same commodities, and by barbarian Tartars on the north, the Chinese had no neighbours with whom they could con veniently trade*.

Timidity and caution appear to be conspicuous traits in their cha racter, and by some are ascribed to the fre quency of corporal punishment. The bamboo is the moral panacea of China, and every subject, from the highest ministers of state to the lowest peasant, is equally liable to be punished by a certain number of strokes, in proportion to their offences. But, as no dis grace is attached t& this punishment, it cannot have any peculiar effect on the courage of the people. It is not tlte pain, btrt the shame and dishonour attending corporal punishments, in most countries, that can have any tendency to depress the spirits and diminish courage. The Chinese appear to be deficient in the talents5 and virtues requisite in a military life ; but their unwarlike character may, with the greatest probability, be ascribed to the situa tion of their country, bordered on the east by the ocean, and on every orher side by moun tains and deserts almost impassable to armies* or by nations greatly inferior in strength. Since the establishment of the Manshur dy nasty, the Chinese have not had an enemy that could call into action any considerable portion of their military force. If we were well acquainted with what passes in the interior of China, and with the particu lars of the state of society throughout that vast"], [222, "192 GOX'ERNMENT. empire, every trait of the national character, which appears to be in some respects an object of contempt and in others of admiration, might undoubtedly be traced to its true and original source. The timidity, the hypocrisy, the cringing servility, the selfishness, and other vices so remarkable among the Chinese, are nothing but the effects of that blasting despo tism under which they live, and which runs through every ramification of the government, and every gradation of office.* The government of China is, by a sort of fiction, considered as patriarchal. The empe ror is the absolute despot over many millions of families, to whose welfare it is impossible that his individual inspection should extend: yet he is regarded as the common father of all his subjects. He exercises over them the same authority as the father of a family, in the patri archal ages, exercised over his particular house hold, and is placed above the control of law. Conformably to this system, the governor of a province, representing the person of the sove reign, is considered as the father of the district over which he presides ; and the head of any office or department is supposed to preside over it with the same authority, interest, and affec- * L'Kveque considers the Chinese as the most vicious of all nations.

This government, however, although nomi nally patriarchal, pretending to be that of a father, and considered as such by the subjects, is evidently calculated to keep them in a state of childhood ; nor is it possible, that without a great change in their political circumstances, they should ever emerge from their minority. In China, the government is the source of almost all moral influence. There is no na tional religion to sway the minds of the people, or regulate their conduct. The religion of the court is that of the Lama; the literati in general profess themselves the disciples of Con fucius ; and the people adhere to the doctrines of Fo, and various other systems of idolatry. But the religious ideas of the Chinese are Vague and indeterminate, and have very little influence on the national character. China, indeed, is one of the very few countries where re ligion is not made an engine of state policy.

We may here observe, that China presents the extreme of despotism, as Athens and Rome formerly exhibited the extremes of popular freedom. These extremes produced a corres ponding difference of character. The Athe nians and Romans, during the flourishing ages of their respective republics, were haughty, proud, and independent, displaying on every occasion the most undaunted courage and the most inflexible patriotism, the natural conse quences of the freedom which they enjoyed, and the share which each citizen had in the government. The Chinese, on the contrary, are timid, deceitful, cringing, and selfish, vices which invariably originate from politi cal slavery. They have the same passions and affections as the ancient Greeks and Romans ; but the despotism of their govern ment, and the punctilious strictness of their laws, prevent them from acquiring indepen dence of mind or energy of character. When"], [225, "GOVERNMENT. 195 the most trifling actions of men are measured by an exact legal scale, when their words and almost their very thoughts are rigidly scru tinized by despotic rulers, they naturally learn to conceal their sentiments under the veil of hypocrisy ; and that deceit, which the terrors of despotism inspire, becoming habitual, cha racterizes their conduct even in private life, and pervades the whole system of society. Next to China, the Ottoman empire presents the most extensive system of complete despo- tism now existing in the world. But in manv respects both the moral and physical circum- stances of the Chinese and the Turks have, during many centuries, been widely different. Issuing from the centre of Asia, and making their way by progressive conquests towards Europe, the Turks distinguished themselves as a martial people : but they never made any great progress in the arts of peace, and even in war they have long been retrogade. This national apathy cannot arise from physical causes, for they inhabit the same countries on which the genius and activity of the ancient Greeks have conferred a lasting celebrity. It must, therefore, be ascribed to their institu- tions, which are fundamentally adverse to im provement. The genius and structure of their political system being entirely military, re quired the constant exercise of the warlike N 2"], [226, "196 GOVERNMENT. talents to keep it in vigour. Cessation from war soon shewed the defects of a government which had made no provision for a system of peace. When the limits of the Turkish empire became fixed, and the conquered nations had sunk into unqualified submission, the tranquillity which ensued, proved fatal to its power ; for the strength and permanence of a military state depend on providing incessant occupation for its troops. Under a pacific system, the janissaries were allowed to abate the strictness of their ancient discipline ; and like the pr\u00e6torian guards of Rome, they soon became the terror instead of the support of the government. The sultans themselves, no longer roused by those great events which called forth the talents and stimulated the exertions of their predecessors, sunk into voluptuousness and indolence ; and the great offices of the state were given to favourites who were destitute of all military claims to promo tion. Occasional wars with the Russians and Austrians have prevented the total extinction of Turkish valour and discipline, but the jarring interests and mutual jealousies of the European powers are the surest support of the Ottoman monarchy. The Turkish government is in its structure not less despotic than that of China ; but its rigour is considerably moderated by the power"], [227, "GOVERNMENT. 197 of religion. The doctrines and precepts of the koran constitute a political code as well as a religious system ; and the laws enacted by Mahomed himself, are regarded as inviolable. It is true that the grand seignor, having the appointment of the mufti, is supreme in reli gion as well as in government ; but he knows that any direct violation of the laws of the koran, would shake the foundations of his throne ; for notwithstanding the despotism of the Ottoman monarchy, numerous instances recorded in its history shew, that there is scarcely a place in the world where it is more necessary to respect public opinion than at Constantinople. That the Turks are a more warlike people than the Chinese, is a necessary effect of their situation. Their wars with the great powers of Europe, whose armies are numerous and well skilled in tactics, have preserved some remains of their martial genius, while the Chinese are but little acquainted with hostili- ties. But a particular circumstance in the social system of Turkey, and which is wholly unknown in China, contributes, perhaps, more than any other to the difference of character by which the people of these two empires are so visibly distinguished. In China, every person who is in no public office, sees himself placed in the most abject situation, with every"], [228, "198 GOVERNMENT. thing above him and no human being below him. In the Ottoman dominions, jews and christians are numerous: over these the Turk is the master, and treats them with greater contempt than the Romans ever shewed to the people of conquered provinces. As every Roman citizen esteemed himself superior to kings, the meanest Turk thinks himself supe rior to christians and jews, whatever may be their rank or their riches ; and these ideas of self-importance, produce a haughtiness of air and character very different from the abject diffidence of the Chinese. The greater part of the European monar chies are despotic, there being no constitu tional check on the power of the sovereign ; but as in these the government is generally administered with equity and mildness by enlightened princes and able ministers, they are far from resembling the Asiatic despotisms; and the difference of national character which they produce is not very considerable. There are few of these governments that do not, more or less, patronize and endeavour to pro mote arts, sciences, letters, and commerce. Universities and academies, with other literary and scientific institutions, are established in every country in this quarter of the globe ; and the same studies and pursuits, although somewhat varied according to casual circum?"], [229, "GOVERNMENT. 199 -tances, are generally common to all. Europe may now be considered as an immense com monwealth, having all its parts intimately connected by mutual interests and general in tercourse, a circumstance which produces a greater uniformity of character, especially amongst persons of a liberal education, than might be expected in countries so different from each other in regard to their civil and religious institutions as well as their physical circumstance. To accommodate the structure of political systems and civil institutions to the exigencies of different nations and ages, is an important and difficult task; and to determine by any general rule what form of government is the most conducive to human happiness, is a problem of no very easy solution, as it depends on a variety of circumstances often so multi farious and minute as to elude investigation. It is almost universally agreed, i hat the system which allows the greatest share of liberty to the subject, is the most eligible. But it must, at the same time, be remembered, that if individual conduct required no restraint, government of any kind would be unnecessary. Political liberty is certainly the basis of national prosperity and happiness; but its measure must be adapted to the state of society. Some nations are not sufficiently"], [230, "200 GOVERNMENT. civilized to be intrusted with any great degree of libertj', or to make a just estimate of its benefits. The freedom which British subjects enjoy, if allowed to the inhabitants of Turkey or China, would produce nothing but licen tiousness and anarchy. Morals and intellect must be cultivated and improved, before nations can derive any advantages from a free constitution. Generous efforts have recently been made by the sovereigns of Russia tQ relieve the peasantry of their empire from feudal restraints j and in their laudable at tempts they appear to have proceeded as far as was consistent with public safety. The name of the feudal system strikes the inhabitants of a free country with horror ; but it is far less terrific to those who live under its influence and experience all its evils ; and it is doubtful whether the Russian peasantry are so anxiously desirous of enfranchisement as an Englishman would suppose. The Prince De Ligne, speak ing of Russia, says \" The subjects of this em pire, whom we have the goodness so often to pity, would not concern themselves about your stales general : they would beseech the philosophers not to enlighten ihem, and the great iords not to permit them to hunt on their grounds.\"* Human nature is so happily * \" Les Sujets de ret empire qu' on a la bonte de plaimlre si souvent oesesoucieroientpasiievosetatsgeneraux: ilsprieroient lesphiloicphe\u00a3"], [231, "201 GOVERNMENT. constituted, that men conform themselves with wonderful pliability to all the varieties of social situation ; and it has frequently been observed, that even in countries where the feudal system prevails, the inhabitants display a cheerfulness of temper that would astonish a native of Britain or of any other country where its multiplied evils no longer exist.* From these remarks and considerations it will appear, that different degrees of liberty are suited to the different stages of civilization ; and that if the freedom of the British constitu tion were suddenly established in Russia, such a revolution would, in all probability, throw the whole empire into confusion. Systems which have existed for ayes, taken deep root, and extended their ramifications through every department of a vast community, command implicit obedience as if they were parts of the order of nature, and every change in their structure ought to be gradual, and introduced with caution.

It is unreasonable to expect perfection in man or his works, and impossible that the most enlightened statesmen and legislators should adapt their systems of government and laws to all the infinite complexity of cases resulting from the ever changing circumstances of society, or anticipate the endless variations of national interest or human delinquency. The best political system, therefore, is that of which the principles are permanent, but capable of a varied application according to times and circumstances. - In every country where despotism does not, as in Turkey and China, level all distinctions among the subjects, the whole mass of the nation may, in a political view, without regarding the more minute gradations or classi fications, be considered as consisting of two great bodies, the aristocracy and the democracy. As it is necessary that, in order to preserve the tranquillity and promote the welfare of the state, the interests of both parties should be consulted, and as much as possible unit' d, it is consequently expedient that, in countries where the people are sufficiently enlightened"], [233, "GOVERNMENT. 203 to be intrusted with the privileges of a free constitution, both the aristocratic and demo cratic bodies should concur in making the laws by which the whole is to be governed. And as the union of the legislative and the executive powers in the same hands must pro duce either despotism or anarchy, it is easy to perceive the expediency of the monarchical branch of government in an extensive empire. A limited monarchy like that of Great Britain, which serves as a pattern to foreign kingdoms, and has, with few variations, been recently adopted by France and Sicily, is of all others the best adapted to promote public pros perty and private happiness. Being a judicious and well proportioned mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, it unites all the advantages of the monarchical and republican systems without their inconveniences, and con stitutes the most perfect plan of government ever devised by human wisdom. It gives to the monarch the power and splendour suitable to the regal office and dignity, while it affords equal protection to the person and the pro perty of the nobleman and the peasant. It encourages genius and industry : and while it provides powerful checks to inordinate ambi tion, it promotes a spirit of laudable enterprise. The influence of such a political system on the character and circumstances of the people, is"], [234, "204 GOVERNMENT. sufficiently visible in their crowded ports, their extensive commerce, and their immense manufactures ; for whatever national prejudice may suggest, or ignorance may suppose, Great Britain is equalled by many, and surpassed by some countries, in the advantages arising from soil and climate.

Its operation, how imperceptible soever it may appear, is constant and perma nent, although often silent and secret. In those moments of privacy, when the thoughts and actions of men are concealed under an impenetrable veil of obscurity, when govern ment and laws cease from having any influence, the impressions which it makes on the mind are often irresistible. In estimating the force of moral impulses, religion may, therefore, be regarded as one of the strongest, and its opera tion on the human character deemed equal, at least, to that of any other social institution. But in treating this subject, it is necessary to"], [236, "206 RELIGION. draw a line of distinction between the false and true systems : the former are merely human institutions, founded on the hopes and fears of mankind, and artfully modelled to particular purposes : the latter constitute the connexion and intercourse between the soul of man and his maker, independent of political regulations and human control. A sense of religion is natural to man, being founded on his hopes and his fears. The cir cumstances of his present and future existence impress it strongly on his mind. All human life being subject to an infinite number of fortuitous accidents, and all futurity hid in a mysterious abyss of impenetrable darkness, such a prospect around and before them, would, in the most barbarous ages, excite men to an earnest inquiry concerning the invisible powers who dispose of happiness and misery.* The learned and celebrated author of the \" Divine Legation of Moses\" very justly observes, that \"The worship of superior powers, the sup posed causes of extraordinary events, and the authors of good and evil, is natural to man in his rudest condition, and necessarily proceeds from hope and fear, the two mainsprings of the human soul.\"-]\" The ancient legislators wisely took advantage of this irresistible pro- * Hume's Nat.

It is evident, therefore, that religion existed before the establishment of political systems. The first legislators made the cur rent opinions of the people, the basis on which they erected their artificial superstructure. The poets acted in a similar manner : Homer and Hesiod embellished, but did not invent the Grecian mytholog}7. The Delphic oracle was an object of super stitious veneration among the neighbouring peasantry, before it was noticed by the legisla tors and rulers of Greece : they afterwards used it as an engine of policy, in order to sanction their designs by the approbation of heaven. The augurs at Rome exercised func tions similar to those of the managers of the oracle of Delphi. They interpreted to the people the will of the gods, by signs in the heavens, the air, or the earth, by inspecting the entrails of victims, by the flying, the chirping, and feeding of birds.* Sage legisla tors and rulers of nations could never have attached any importance to such absurdities, had they not perceived that these superstitions had taken fast hold on the minds of the people. But that being the case, they wisely converted vulgar opinions into an engine of state policy. * Auguries were in use: at the time of the Trojan war.

The greatest philoso phers, legislators, and statesmen among the Greeks and the Romans, despised both oracles and auguries, with the whole train of super stitious illusion interwoven in the system of their religion ; but they considered them as useful in governing an ignorant and turbulent populace. The effects of religion may be traced through all the scenes of the moral world. Its influence on the human mind, however, is disputed, and even denied by a writer of considerable cele brity. \" The conduct of men and of nations/5 says Helvelius, \" is rarely consistent with their belief, or even their speculative opinions.

Every river had its deity : every fountain its nymph or its naiad ; and every mountain and wood their orcades and driades. Venus, and her attendant graces, hovered over female beauty : Hebe gave bloom to the youthful cheek: Cupid, ever frolicking among youths and maidens, inspired the amorous passion. Juno was the patroness of marriage, Hymen its attendant, and Diana the goddess and guardian of female innocence. Every social enjoyment, as well as every im portant pursuit, was under celestial influence and protection. The first political institutions of the Greeks were in conformity with their theological ideas; and the religion of Greece was congenial with the spirit of liberty. Jupiter was invested with sovereign authority, but not with despotic * Vide Homer's Odissey, lib. 4. and Pindar's Olymp. 2."], [243, "RELIGION. 213 rule. His conduct was sometimes arraigned by the inferior divinities: his measures were discussed, and their propriety often disputed in the assembly of the gods; and he was under the perpetual control of fate. The Grecian mythology, as Dr. Russell observes, exhibited a species of mixed monarchy, not unlike those which existed in Greece before the establish ment of republican governments. But if such a religion favoured human genius and exertion, it was highly inimical to morals. \" The gods and goddesses not only had the human form, but were subject to all the excesses of the human passions. They differed in nothing from the most corrupted human beings except in the possession of superior wisdom, power, and immortality. All of them had been guilty of violence, cruelty, fraud, or debau chery. The worship of such divinities could not inspire morality, nor repress licentiousness, but rather seemed to tolerate and excuse every vice. With their religion, the character of the Greeks appeared perfectly to coincide. They were adventurous, valiant, and ingenious; but scarcely any people were ever more vicious. They were turbulent under rule, unsteady in politics, cruel to slaves, tyrants to their wives, and addicted to unnatural vices.

But that meaning being above vulgar comprehension, they were believed in their literal sense by the multitude, who were consequently corrupted by divine example. In delineating a picture of paganism, an essential distinction must be made between the religion of the learned and that of the vulgar. Aristotle asserts the existence of one only God, the good, the eternal, and supreme Being; and this was the doctrine and belief of all the philo sophical heathens.-]\" \"All that multiplicity of gods,\" says Cudworth, \" which makes so great a shew and noise, was really nothing but several names and notions of one supreme deity according to his different manifestations in the world ; so that one unmade, self-existent deity, and no more, was acknowledged by the more intelligent pagans. \"J The Eleusinian mysteries seem to have been instituted for the purpose of purifying the minds of the initiated from the gross tenets of that mythology which was promulgated to the multitude, by incul cating the unity of God and the immortality of * Dion Halicarnass, lib. 2. cap. 20.

Plato recom- mended the appointment of solemn festivals to the honour of the twelve principal gods of Greece; but h^ did not prescribe to the people the worship of one supreme Deity, because he regarded his essence as incomprehensible, and the most acceptable mode of worshipping him impossible to determine.* The priests might also be unwilling that the people should have any notion of communicating with heaven without their intervention and ministry.

The religion of these ancient nations was not merely a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples. It was closely interwoven with every circumstance of public and private life. The most important concerns of peace and war were prepared and concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which both the magistrate, the senator, and the soldier, participated. The influence of such a religion on the national character cannot be disputed, and, indeed, it is conspicuous in almost every page of ancient history. A celebrated writer says, \" It was neither fear nor piety that established religion among the Romans, but a conviction of its necessity in every society. Their first kings were not less attentive to the regulation of public wor ship and its ceremonies, than to the establish ment of laws, and the construction of walls.* The institutionsofTatius and Numa had taken such hold on the minds of the people, that when the regal government was abolished, the Romans, in their enthusiasm for liberty, had not the audacity to cast off the yoke of religion, f * Montesquiou Grandeur et Decadence des Romains.

But it is not to be supposed that the Romans had received no religious impressions before their rulers regulated their superstitions, and digested them into a system ; for as it has already been observed, the first legislators always made the current prepossessions of the people the basis of their religion. When the Roman legislators formed their re ligious institutions, they followed the example of the Greeks, and gave no attention to the reformation of the manners or the fixing of the principles of morality, deeming it imprudent to impose too great restraints on men who were yet ignorant of the engagements of a society into which they had so recently been collected.* They had only one general view, \u2014 that of in spiring the people with the sear of the gods, and making use of that fear in order to govern them with greater facility. \" The successors of Numa,'' says Montes quiou, \" durst not complete what that prince had left deficient.

Montesquiou seems to approve their conduct in this respect, by observing, that \" Human institutions may be altered, but divine ordinances ought lo be im mutable like the gods themselves. \"f But this doctrine precludes every idea of reformation in religious establishments. Montesquiou ought to have remembered, that when religion be comes corrupted by human abuses, its corrup tions should be removed.

And from the superior purity of the Roman theology, when compared with that of the Gieeks, the former displayed a superior strictness in morals. An ancient historian observes, that as among the Greeks, a man in office was rarely to be found whose hands were clean from peculation, so it was no less rare among the Romans to discover one that was stained with this crime. He further adds, that in their magistracies and embassies, the Romans disbursed the largest sums with inviolable honesty on the single obligation of an oath, and that a Roman citizen paid as much regard to his word or solemn engagement in private, as to a written contract attested by witnesses. f Divination by oracles, auguries, and other similar means, which may be traced, with some variations, from Egypt and Babylon, to Greece and Rome, was an essential branch of the pagan religion, and a powerful instrument in * Dion.

Means that may appear ridiculous to the wise, are often necessary in governing an ignorant multitude. The augurs and aruspices were a sort of grotesque actors in the drama of paganism; but their art will not appear ridicu lous, if we consider that, in a religion entirely popular, nothing could seem extravagant.* The Romans as well as the Greeks were a semi- barbarous people at the time when their religion was established ; and the vulgar of both nations always remained ingulphed in superstition and ignorance. They were less affected by simple truths, than by subjects of admiration. They required signs of super natural agency, and supposed them only to be sound in what was marvellous and above their comprehension. It may indeed seem ridiculous to make the destiny of the republic depend on the appetite of a sacred fowl, or on the appearance of the * Montesquiou Grandeur et Decadence des Romains.

If their religious rites had been more rational, persons of talents and genius might have been their dupes as well as the vulgar, and thus have lost all the ad vantages that were to be derived from popular superstition and ignorance. It was therefore requisite to have such institutions as might keep up the superstition of the people, and enter into the political views of their rulers; and this was precisely the case with divina tions. The declarations of heaven were put in the mouths of the principal senators, who perfectly knew both the absurdity and the utility of things of this nature. The Roman writers inform us how greatly the arts of divi nation were venerated by the people and des pised by the principal philosophers, legisla tors, and commanders of armies.* The magis trates being masters of the presages, possessed the most effectual means of ruling the suffrages in the popular assemblies.

To these the halls of Odin were ever open : on these were lavished all the pleasures and luxuries the most delight ful to a Gothic imagination. But the pusil lanimous, and those who died of disease and old age, were, by the laws and religion of Scandinavia, held contemptible and infamous in this world, aud condemned in another life to severe and perpetual punishment, plunged into more than midnight gloom, surrounded by enormous piles of ice, in regions of eternal frost, for ever haunted by the apparitions of damned spirits, and tormented by loathsome serpents.* To avoid this horrible lot, death in battle, or suicide, was the only alternative. * Valerius Maximus speaking of the Cimbri,sajs, \" In acie exulta bant tanqiiaiu glririose et feliciter vita excessuri : lamentabantur in morbo quasi tjirpiter et miserabi liter perituri.\" \" lu the field of battle they exulted in the prospect of a glorious and happy exit: in sickness they bemoaned their fate in perishing by an infamous am} miserable death.\" Valer.

The histories of England and France record their extensive and repeated depredations, and exhibit a dreadful picture of their ferocious character. The famous Lodbroker Quida, or death song ofRagnar Lodbrog, shews the perfect corres pondence of their military and moral ideas and sentiments, with their horrific mythology.

In comparing the Greeks and the Romans with the ferocious inhabitants of the northern regions, we find the same difference in their national characters as in their religious ideas, The Greek and Roman mythologies possessed all that magnificent painting, and that myste rious sublimity which powerfully strikes the imagination ; but they had no imagery so wild and terrific, so calculated to inspire the love of war, slaughter, and sanguinary cruelty, as that which was displayed in the religion of Scandinavia. The consequence was, that the Greeks and Romans delighted in mental im provement, and cultivated the arts of refine ment amidst the bustle of wars and the exulta tions of triumph, while the northern nations could be pleased only with scenes of carnage and devastation. * Drake's Literary Hours, vol. 3. p. 317."], [263, "RELIGION. 233 There has never existed a people on whose national character and circumstances religion has had a more conspicuous influehce, than it had on the Arabians in the time of Mahomed, and under the caliphs his immediate successors.

The greater part of the people were attached to the Sabean idolatry, or the worship of the celestial bodies. Judaism was also in part the religion of the country, and had been adopted by one of the Arabian kings, as well as by many of his sub jects, long before the destruction of Jerusalem. After that disastrous event, numbers of jews had taken refuge in Arabia ; and several inde pendent tribes professed theMosaical religion. The persecution of s-everal sects of christains by the Greek emperors, had driven many of their followers into Arabia, where they found a secure asylum.* And the commerce and connexion of that country with Persia and India had introduced the opinions of the Manichees and Magi, as well as the doctrine of the Metempsichosis, with several other tenets of Brammical origin. t The Arabians, therefore, were a mixture of christians, jews, \u2014 1 -u-i : ,-, - * Ockley's History of the Saracens, vol.

The followers of the prophet were, therefore, encouraged to fight without fear for the propagation of the faith, since they were taught that, besides the merit of this service and its eternal reward, no caution could avert their inevitable destiny, nor prolong for a moment their lives. If it be asked why these doctrines did not continue to excite the same dauntless courage and the same ardent spirit of enterprise in aftertimes, as in the first ages of the caliphate, and why they have now almost wholly lost their efficacy, the answer is easy, as the reason is obvious. Enthusiasm, how ever ardent it may be, or by whatever means it may be excited, seldom burns long with a steady and undiminished flame. Of this, history furnishes innumerable instances. Every new religion is adopted with a fervid zeal by its first votaries: it is then a matter of conviction : it is upper most in their thoughts: it occupies the princi pal place in their minds, and forcibly com mands their attention.

It would, perhaps, be difficult to find among modern christians that indefatigable zeal, that dauntless perseverance, and that inflexible constancy, under the severest trials by which they were distin guished in the apostolic age, and in the second and third centuries. The system of religion and government which Mahomed framed and established, was more calculated for exciting a thirst of con- quest than for giving stability to empire. Although the koran is the civil as Well as the religious code of all the Mahomedan nations, it conveys no just or clear notion either of the relative duties of mankind in society, of the formation of the body politic, Or of the princi- ples of government.* The first caliphs reigned under the supposed sanction of divine autho- rity, as the legal successors of the prophet, and were considered by their subjects as the vice- gerents of the deity. But in process of time the caliphate, being rent asunder by the suc- cessful revolts of \\arious pretenders to empire, was split intodiff rent and hostile monarchies.

The conquest of the greater part of India by Mahomedan invaders, over turned the political system and most of the ancient governments of that celebrated country ; but the bloody and devastating wars, carried on with little intermission for the space of more than six centuries, would rather seem calculated to render the Hindoos a war like than a pusillanimous people. One great and powerful cause, however, seems always to have operated in India to the exaltation of the privileged classes and the degradation of the people. Their religion, with which their government is so intimately united as to form only one system, has a constant tendency to depress the genius as well as the courage of the Hindoos, to prevent every kind of emula tion, and to extinguish the spirit of enterprise.

Religion is often mutilated by time, veiled by mystery, debased by superstition, and variously corrupted in passing through the hands of men. The religion of the Hindoos and the ancient Persians sprung, in all proba bility, from the same source, and was originally pure theism, transmitted from Shem, Elam, and their other patriarchal ancestors ; but it was gradually corrupted by the Magi of Persia, and the Bramins of India.* The theologv of the magi, however, was. reformed by the second Zoroaster, and was never so degraded as that of the Bramins, which has degenerated into a system of tyranny, as well as of the grossest idolatary ; although it originally inculcated just and sublime notions of the essence of the deity.-]- anh The institutes of Menu, whom the Hindoos regard as their primeval lawgiver and patri arch, exhibit a system of despotism and priest craft both limited by law, but artfully con spiring to give mutual support though with * Hyde Relig.

This may, perhaps, be the principal cause of the striking difference of character between the Birmans and the Hindoos, although situated so near to each other, and even under the same parallels of latitude. The Hindoo religion is now become one of the most degrading systems existing in the world: \" The influence of priestcraft over superstition/' says Mr. Orme, \"is no where so visible as in India^ All the concerns of life have a strict analogy and connexion with the ceremonies of religion ; and the Bramins have inculcated such avariety of strange persuasions. that the Hindoo finds himself every hour under the necessity of consulting his spiritual guide.

Every one knows, that from time immemorial, the whole mass of Hindoo population has been divided into four great casts or classes. Of these the principal is, that of the Bramins or priests, who not only possess the most exalted rank but pretend to a superior origin, and are revered with the most \u00ab Orme's Historical Fragments of the Mogul Emp.

The second is the Sittri or Chittri tribe, who, according to their institutions, are military men, although some of them engage in other occupations. The third is the tribe of Beise, which consists of merchants, bankers, shopkeepers, and others concerned in trade; and the fourth is that of the Sooder, who are employed in manual labour, and debarred by irrevocable laws from rising to any superior rank. If any one be ex communicated from any of these casts he cannot be received into another, but is for ever excluded from society, and abhorred by every man in the nation. This circumstance renders religion all-powerful, and excommuni cation so dreadful, that almost any Hindoo will suffer death rather than deviate from one article of his faith, \u2014 a circumstance which renders their conversion to Christianity ex ceedingly difficult. The four grand divisions of the Hindoos are again subdivided into a number of other casts or classes, of which the distinctions and order of pre-eminence are decidedly fixed by religion and law. The members of each cast invariably adhere to the profession of their ancestors, from which every deviation would be impious and profane; and from generation to genera tion the same families or casts follow the same line of life.

And although the institution of hereditary employments might in bridling ambition serve the purpose of an usurping priesthood, by de pressing the spirit of the people, it must at the same time have depressed genius, by imposing a restraint upon its versatility, and extin guished the ardour of emulation, without which the liberal arts can never attain to superior excellence.

These regulations appear to have produced the same effects both in Egypt and India. The ancient Egyptians, like the modern Hindoos, were the slaves of their priests, who exercised, in the name and under the sanction of the gods, a despotic authority over men. Dr. Russell has accurately delineated their intellectual character, and if we compare it with that of the Hindoos, the picture will exhibit a striking resemblance. \" The genius of the Egyptians,\" says this excellent writer, *' was acute and steady, rather than liberal or elevated. They prosecuted works of expence and ingenuity with singular perseverance, and upon principles purely mathematical ; but they were totally destitute of taste ; and never acquired a distinguished rank among. the cul tivators of the fine arts.

The division of a whole nation into casts or classes with the institution of hereditary pro- sessions, if rigidly adhered to, must, wherever it takes place, produce similar effects.-]\" In regard to the social system, it establishes a regular series of strict subordination, and * Russell's Hist.

Dulness in design, and accuracy in execu tion, seem lo characterize the genius of all the oriental nations. Of this, despotism is the cause. The Chinese, as well as the Hindoos, possess, in an eminent degree, the talent of imitation, but appear to have no genius for invention. In China, however, religion has no legal establishment, nor scarcely any in fluence on society. But in China the despo tism of the government produces nearly the same effects as those which proceed from the despotism of religion in India : the great object of both is to exact a passive submission, which cannot fail of degrading the character and destroying the mental energies of the people. The despotism of the Chinese government, however, appears to be far less hostile to intel lectual exertion, than that of the Braminical re ligion in India. The elements of literature are almost universally diffused among the Chinese. They have an infinite number of publications, on all subjects not connected with the govern ment \u2014 particularly in poetry, and the othsr departments of the \" Belles Lettres.\" Every considerable city in China contains several"], [278, "248 RELIGION. booksellers shops ; and Sir George Staunton, in enumerating the advantages which that em pire possesses, mentions the intelligence of the lower classes of the people.* But the small portion of learning that exists among the Hindoos, is almost entirely confined to the priesthood.

In regard to the improvement of intellect, the Chinese have very great advantages over the Hindoos. There are no privileged classes in China : em ployment under the government is the only source of distinction ; the way to public offices is open to all ; and learning is the sole recoup mendation to preferment. But among the Hindoos, the place which every individual must occupy in society, is fixed by irrevocable laws, claiming for their origin and establish- ment the sanction of divine authority. In China, the cultivation of letters meets with encouragement ; and emulation is excited. in India, the progress of intellect is checked, the diffusion of learning prevented, and all emulation necessarily extinguished. In the northern parts of India, where re peated invasions and almost incessant commo tions have so often roused the natives to arms, the power of religion is greatly weakened, and the different casts, although seldom confounded f Pinkerton's Mod.

Bramins are frequently soldiers: many of them eat flesh, which is positively prohibited by their religion ; and they always carry offensive weapons. Even the merchants and the mechanics, when they travel only a sew miles, are all strongly armed, and in some of the northern provinces, particularly in Bunde- leund, the husbandmen carry their spears with them into the field,* The character of these northern Hindoos is also very different from that of the mild and passive inhabitants of the lower Carnatic, the Panjab, and some of the neighbouring provinces, even those of the domestic and unwarlike professions are brave, daring,^nd frequently cruel. 1 he Mahrattas are a warlike people, and the founder of their states, the famous Sevagee, was a hero whose name would not disgrace the annals of Greece or Rome. The Seiks, who inhabit the north- western provinces, are already become formi dable, and rather want discipline than courage to render them equal to European troops. But the religion of the Seiks appears to differ con siderably from that of the other nations of India ; and even among the Mahrattas the power of the Bramins is greatly diminished. Mr. Orme ascribes the difference between the * Chatfield's Hindostan, p. 165.

Superstition, when skilfully managed by pa- triotic politicians, may serve to excite and ele- vate the mind instead of depressing the spirits and inspiring pusillanimity. To this end it was directed by the legislators of Greece and Rome, by the chiefs of Scandinavia, and by the Ara- bian prophet. But the usurping priests of India seem to have had no other object in view than to keep the people in a state of passive submission. Had not this been the case, a religion which can impel its infatuated votaries to throw themselves under the chariot wheels of the idol of Juggernaut, and inspire delicate females with an intrepidity that enables them to meet the most terrible death without fear, in voluntarily burning themselves on the fune- ral piles of their deceased consorts, might have been made a powerful engine for rousing the courage of the Hindoos against foreign inva ders, and preserving the independence of their * Orme's Historical Fragments, b.

After exhibiting the origin, and considering the effects of false systems of religion, it is necessary to examine the influence of the doc trines of eternal truth on the human character, and on human happiness. An ample field here lies open to our survey ; and presents a contrast most striking and impressive.

It inculcated just ideas of the essence and attributes of the Supreme Being, impressed on the mind a con tinual sense of his superintending providence, and communicated the knowledge of his will in regard to moral conduct. Instead of de luding the minds of the people by oracles and auguries, and by a confused assemblage of deities, the offspring of ignorance and super stition, of fiction and fraud, it taught them to look up in every circumstance of life to the author of their existence, the omnipotent and omniscient ruler of the universe, of whose favourable regard they were assured so long as their actions were conformable to his laws. A line of moral distinction, both in specula tion and practice, was drawn between the jews and the heathens ; and whoever will take the trouble to examine and compare the writings of the Hebrews with those of the most en lightened philosophers among the Greeks and the Romans, whom education and habit have taught us to regard as the luminaries of the ancient world, will readily perceive the diffe rent effects which their respective systems were calculated to produce on the human mind, and consequently on the conduct of men in society. It has been already observed that the primeval lawgivers of Egypt and Crete, of Greece and"], [284, "254 RELIGION. Rome, established their religious systems under the pretended sanction of some ideal or allego rical deity, whose power, at the best, was limited to a particular department of the world and its government, whose authority was ill defined and uncertain, and whose very person and essence were confounded in the wild chaos of pagan mythology. Moses was the only legislator of antiquity who promulgated a na tional religion in the commanding and awful name of the one supreme and eternal being, the creator and governor of the universe, whose omnipresence pervades the whole system of nature, and whose providence, inspecting the whole train of causes and effects in the moral as well as the physical world, foresees, directs, and controls all events. The purity of the Mosaical relegion cor responded with the grandeur of its origin. The divinities of Greece were slaves to the same passions as their votaries, and most of them were stained with crimes. The gods of all the pagan nations delighted in scenes of human slaughter ; and sometimes their wrath could be appeased only by human sacrifices. The more mild and benevolent of their deities were pleased with impure rites and bacchanalian festivals.

The solemn rites by which he was honoured were of the purest kind : the ceremonies and injunctions which appear only as minuti\u00e6, and in a superficial view might be deemed unimportant, were calculated to pro mote either the health and comfort of indivi duals, or the good order and peace of society. One of the greatest advantages of the Hebrew religion over every system of paganism, was the peculiar excellency of its precepts, and the means of acquiring moral and religious in struction, which it afforded to every class of the people. The pagans never appointed in structors to deliver moral precepts in the name of the gods.* The people frequented the temples and attended the solemn rites of re ligion as well as other public shews ; but they did uot receive any moral or religious instruc tions from their priests, who never considered it as any part of their duty to enlighten the minds of the multitude. Among the Israelites the case was totally different. The scriptures were read and explained in the synagogues every sabbath day, and thus became intelligible to the meanest capacity.

This seeming defect has not been overlooked by infidels. The Greeks and the Romans, say they, had their Elysium, and their Tartarus : the ferocious Scandinavians had their Valhalla and their Nistheim ; and most of the pagan nations, of whose creeds history has left any memorial, believed that in another life happiness and misery should be impartially dispensed to the souls of the departed according to the merit or demerit of their actions in the present state of existence. But the Hebrew legislator endea vouring to impress, in a forcible manner, his system of religion and law on the minds of the people, by exciting their hopes and their fears* confines all his promises and threats to the things of this life without directing their views to any object beyond the grave. To assign a satisfactory reason for this omission of a doctrine which is calculated to operate as the strongest incitement to virtue, and the most powerful check to vice, is a task to which the powers of the human understanding are wholly inadequate. The learned Dr. War burton has displayed both genius and erudition itt the investigation of this important and"], [287, "RELIGION. 257 difficult subject ; but some of his arguments, however ingenius, are far from being satis factory to an inquiring mind.* If we should hazard an opinion on so difficult a point, it seems the most probable that the Mosaical law, being entirely a national system, and political as well as religious, the doctrine of a future state was left out because its rewards and punishments could be inflicted only on in dividuals, while temporal happiness and misery exhibited in awful contrast, were proposed lo the consideration of the Israelites, as these alone could affect the community.-]\" But whe ther this hypothosis be well or ill founded, it is certain that the clear revelation of a future state was reserved for the coming of Christ, and the establishment of a more perfect religion. In the first glimmering of light remote objects were involved in obscurity ; but when the evangelical sun rose above the horizon, the prospect was enlarged, and eternity laid open to the intellectual view. The Mosaical system being only a prepara tive to a more extended revelation of the divine will was superseded by Christianity, which, overwhelming paganism with all its crowd of fictitious divinities, effected the most important * Vide Divine Legation of Moses, passim, t Vide Deuteronomy, chap, 2S. R"], [288, "258 RELIGION. revolution in human ideas as well as morals, that ever took place since man was created. The religion of the Hebrews was designed for a particular period of time and for a pecu liar nation, and not for all ages nor for the whole human race. Several of its rites and injunctions were not calculated for every situ ation and climate : it is therefore sufficiently evident that its extension was to be limited and its existence temporary.* Christianity is a system of a totally different nature : it is suited to every country, to every age and climate, and capable of being adapted to all the variety of human circumstances. This, indeed, is one of its distinguishing excellencies, and shews that it is calculated for universal diffusion and perpetual duration. Such a religion was absolutely necessary to mankind. During a long succession of ages all the nations of the earth, with the single exception of the jews, had, in regard to re ligious matters, been left to grope their way under a canopy of fuliginous darkness. \" On the most enlightened nations the cloud of superstition hung dark, awful, and portentous. * All persons of the male sex were enjoined to appear at Jerusalem three times in the year ; Exod. chapter 23, v. 14, 17.

Their divinities were capricious, selfish, and revengeful, and the fears of the worshipper often appeared in the cruel rites which he employed to appease them, and in the numberless occurrences which revealed to him the intimations of their displeasure. A dream, an omen, any unusual event excited his alarm : the general darkness which surrounded him converted his alarms into settled terror ; and his inability to determine which of the deities he had offended, in what his offence consisted, and by what means it was to be expiated, often raised his terror to distraction and despair.\"* It must be acknowledged that the fears which Mr. Finlaysoh here de- scribes, as besetting the votaries of paganism, are not very conspicuous in the conduct of the Greek and Roman legislators and rulers, who used their religion as an instrument for govern- ing the people, nor in that of their popular assemblies and their armies, whose apprehen sions, although easily excited, were readily allayed by the skilful management of their magistrates and commanders.

In such situations superstition has always the most powerful influence; and although the philosophers and magistrates of Greece and Rome attached no credit to the absurd tales of their fictitious mythology, the case was very different with the vulgar, and even with the higher classes in nations less enlightened. History informs us, that kings and military commanders often sacri ficed their favourites, their relatives, and sometimes even their own children on the altars of their gods, in order lo appease their supposed anger, and to avert their dreaded vengeance. In the view of delivering mankind from this slavish fear of cruel, capricious, and vindictive divinities, Epicurus devised a system of phi losophical atheism. But the cure was, in some respects, worse than the disease, as by extinguishing the dread of superior beings, it left the inordinate passions of men without any religious restraint, and opened the flood gates to every kind of vice and licentiousness. Nothing could effectually dispel this intellec tual darkness, and remove these moral evils,"], [291, "RELIGION. 261 but just conceptions of the nature and attri butes of God ; and this knowledge could be acquired only through the medium of a divine revelation. Dense clouds rest upon the hal lowed and inaccessible habitation of the deity ; but through the agency of Christianity, beams of glory, darting from his eternal throne, shine around on every side, and give to the human mind an illumination which it could never have attained by its own powers. The christian revelation supplied the defects of the Mosaical system, and exploded the errors of paganism. Its doctrines and precepts were calculated to enlighten the minds and to regulate the actions of men. Besides in culcating just ideas of the essence and attri butes of the supreme being, it established the important doctrine of a future state, of rewards and punishments, concerning which the Mosai cal law had been silent, which had been darkly insinuated by the Hebrew prophets, and of which the pagan philosophers had formed only vague and confused notions. At the time when Christ appeared in the world, this doctrine was regarded, not only by the gentiles but even by the jews, as a philosophi cal opinion, rather thau an article of faith : the latter did not consider it as an essential part of their law ; and it was rejected by many of the greatest and most learned men in the"], [292, "262 RELIGION. nation.* The question, however, was of the utmost importance to mankind, and, in it, every individual, from the highest to the lowest, was personally and deeply interested.

When Pope Gregory the Great, towards the end of the sixth century, liberated his own slaves, he recommended the same conduct to others, by declaring, that \" As our Redeemer the Creator and Lord of all, was graciously pleased to take human flesh, that by his divine favour he might set us free from the bondage (of sin) by which we were held captives, and restore us to our primitive liberty, so also ought we to restore to freedom those men whom nature made free, but whom the laws of nations have subjected to slavery.\"* During the middle ages, it was common to emancipate slaves \" for the love of God,\" \"for the remission of sins,*' &c. A volume, indeed, would scarcely suffice for the enumeration of the instances of manumission on the principle of religion, nor of the various laws enacted by christian sovereigns, for the purpose of miti gating the rigours of slavery, and preparing the way to its abolition. f In recent times, \u25a0* \"Cum Redemptor noster, totius Conditor natur\u0153,ad hoc propitia tus, humanam carnem voluerit assumere ut Divinitatis su\u00e6 gratia, dirempto (quo tenebamnr capttvi) vinculn, pristin\u00e6 nos libertati, resti tueret salubriter agitursi horaines, quosabinitio, liberos natura protulit, and jus Gentium jugo substituit servitutis, in ea qui nati fuerant manu mittentis beneficio libertati reddantur.\" Potgiess. lib. 4. chap. 1. + Da Conge Voce Manumissio Muratori Antiq.

All this indeed is natural. Christianity, wherever it is pro fessed, must have either a direct or an indirect influence on all classes of men from the highest to the lowest. It establishes a train of moral ideas to which every one gives his assent, although often without either examining their propriety or considering their importance; and those impressions which float unquestioned and. undefined over the understanding, give a colouring to the character, and a bias to the conduct of multitudes, who are scarcely aware of their existence. Christianity has a direct influence on real, and an indirect influence on mere nominal professors: the latter is even extended to those who are seldom seen in the place of worship ; for how destitute soever an individual may be of the spirit of religion, he finds it necessary to respect the notions and manners that are established in society. It is thus that Christianity has so great a share in fashioning the public mind ; and even princes who understand the art of government, always"], [299, "269 RELIGION. respect public opinion. The history of the world exhibits a series of incontrovertible evi dence that Christianity has moulded even des potic governments to humanity : that it has given rise to wise and equitable laws : that it has disarmed war of a great part of its terrors : that it has taught the great, the rich, and the powerful, to acknowledge that all men are brethren, and given to the poor a rank and consequence which they never possessed amidst the boasted freedom of Greece and Rome. Christianity has been greatly conducive to the advancement of literature and science. It threw into circulation an immense number of new ideas, by which it enriched the intellectual world; and it has been particularly instru mental in preserving and disseminating moral and classical knowledge. It formed a nu merous body of men whom it compelled by the nature of their profession and employment to cultivate their talents, to cherish regular habits of thought, and to study the most effectual me thod of elucidating the doctrines which they taught. Learning could not be entirely lost while there was an order of men to whom a moderate share of it, at least, was necessary to qualify them for the sacerdotal office, and entitle them to its emoluments. The propaga tion of Christianity was every where accom panied by the introduction of letters among"], [300, "270 RELIGION. nations to whom they were unknown, and their dissemination in countries where they were already in use. To Christianity we are in debted for the preservation of the classical works of antiquity, and consequently for all that we know of the ancients. During the anarchy and barbarism which followed the subversion of the Roman empire, and continued for many centuries, the monasteries, which furnished comfortable retreats from war and tyranny, served also as inns for the accommo dation of travellers, as repositories for books, and as schools for the education of youth. It has been objected against Christianity, that by forbidding to return evil for evil, and in culcating the contempt of glory, it destroys the greatest incentives to martial exploits.* Rousseau considers the precepts of the gospel as inconsistent with liberty, valour, and pa triotism. But that writer, who is remarkable for self contradiction, is confuted by his own words when he says that if all were perfect christians, soldiers would dispise danger and death. -\\ Gibbon also insinuates that the pro pagation of the doctrines and precepts of the gospel tended to the depression of courage, and remarks the aversion of the primitive christians * Machiavel Disc, on Liv. b. 2. chap. 2. 1- Rousseau's Social Contract, vol, 4. chap. 8."], [301, "271 RELIGION. to a political or a military life.* But the historian of the decline and fall of the empire was not ignorant that among the Romans the ceremonies of the pagan religion were in timately blended with all the concerns of war, as well as with those of the magistracy, and that it was difficult, and in some cases next to impossible, to exercise the functions of a magis trate, a senator, or a soldier, without being polluted by idolatry. f The genius of pa ganism, therefore, rather than that of Christia nity, was the principal cause of the reluctance of the early professors of the gospel to engage in political or military affairs. The christian religion, although it forbids revenge and retaliation, does not prohibit self defence, nor the exercise of war for the purpose of repelling unjust aggression and maintaining national rights. And, in conformity to this view of the evangelical doctrines, we find that as soon as Christianity became,the established religion of the Roman empire* its professors readily inlisted under the banners of the state.

A writer, who has deli gently investigated the subject, says \" It is of the utmost importance that the religious im pressions made on the mind of the soldier should not be of a gloomy or dispiriting na ture: they should be connected with hope, not with fear, or they will tend to make him cowardly instead of brave.

The armies of Christendom have, in deeds of valour, rivalled those of Greece and Rome ; and at this day, the christian nations of Europe are far superior to all the rest of the world in martial prowess and the art of war. It must, however, be acknowledged, that Christianity was an indirect cause of some effects which may appear of a pernicious or at least of a doubtful nature. The happy effect of the gospel in reforming the morals of its professors, at first, were every where conspicu ous. But when it became perverted from its genuine simplicity, and to proselyte men, to particular opinions, instead of convertingthem from vice to virtue, was the principal object of its ministers, it began to lose much of its benign influence.

The elaborate attempts of infidels to invali date the authority of the gospel, have excited men of the greatest talents and genius to an accurate examination of its nature and origin, and brought into light such proofs of the authenticity of the christian revelation, as seem to have now put the matter beyond all dispute. The variety of opinions entertained by the different sects of christians, have also impelled them to examine every passage of the sacred writings with the most critical accuracy.

Difference of opinion, in matters of religion, connected with freedom of inquiry, are favourable to the progress of intellect ; but lite intemperance of zeal, and the intolerance of bigotry, contract the limits of reason and philosophy. The mind, when accustomed to an implicit submission to authority in religion or science, loses its powers of exertion, and becomes incapable of improvement. In the middle ages, when the ignorance of the laity, had naturally and necessarily increased, to an exorbitant degree, the influence of the clergy, the church established a system of intolerance which extinguished freedom of thought, and checked all mental energy.

VII. EDUCATION and HABIT. Although political and religious institutions are the most powerful of all moral causes in swaying the mind and forming the character, yet there are other impulses which have often a considerable influence in stimulating and directing the actions of men. Among these secondary causes, the chief are education and habit, which are so nearly allied, as to be scarcely distinguishable from each other, by any line of separation. If, indeed, we confine our notion of education to the instructions received in childhood, and consider habit as an assemblage of customs, of modes of thinking and acting imbibed in later years, and arising from the various circum stances of life, the two words will convey very different ideas. But by taking a more ,ex-"], [311, "EDUCATION AND HABIT. 281 tended survey, we shall find that they signify pre cisely the same thing, \u2014 the general result of in formation, observation, and experience co-ope rating with the human passions and inclina tions. Viewing the subject in this light we must, with Helvetius, adopt the well known axiom of Cicero, and consider education as con tinuing from the cradle to the grave, from the first dawn of infant perception, to the last mo ment of reasoning existence. Considered in this point of view, education comprehends the whole intellectual life of man ; and the developement of his faculties in all the different circumstances in which he may happen to be placed ; and its power is acknowledged by all who have made the his tory of the human species the subject of their study and observation. Quintilian thinks that the minds and characters of men are formed almost wholly by education ; and Locke appears to be nearly of the same opinion.* An elegant and philosophical writer of our own times, says \" The prodigies effected by human art in all the objects around \u25a0us \u2014 laws \u2014 government \u2014 commerce \u2014 religion ; but above all the records of thought preserved in those volumes that fill our libraries : what are they hut experiments by which nature \u2022 Vide Instil.

The mind is at first a perfect blank, fitted and ready to re ceive any kind of impressions. For these we are dependent on the political, civil, and religious institutions under which we live, the persons with whom we are connected, and the circumstances in which we are placed in the different periods of life. Wholly the creatures of association and habit, the charac ters of men are formed by the instruction, conr versation, and example of those with whom they mix in society, or whose ideas they imbibe in the course of their reading and studies. The aggregate of all these concurring circum stances being infinitely varied in the case of each nation, as well as of each individual, gives rise to that diversity of character which is observable among civilized men, and makes the difference between the savage and the sage. \" If,\" says Helvetius, \" all the Savoyards have, in some degree, the same character, it is be cause chance has placed them in situations nearly similar, and that they almost all re- * Dug.

Because there is no living without money, and they have none at home. Why are they laborious? Because they are with out assistance and without protection in the countries to which they transplant themselves, and bread is not to be had without labour. Why are they faithful and diligent ? Because to be employed in preference to the natives, they must surpass them in diligence and fidelity. Why, in the last place, are they all frugal ? Because having, like other men, an attachment to their native country, they go out beggars to return rich, and live on what they have accumulated.''* Helvetius here observes, that to form in any man the charac ter of the Savoyard, he must be placed in the same situation. Some writers lay less stress upon education, and attribute many of its supposed effects to natural genius. This, indeed, is the soil of talents ; but they owe their culture to educa tion, without which they could scarcely vege tate, and certainly could not bloom or blossom. \" The difference of natural talents in different men,\" says Dr. Smith, \" is, in reality, much * Helvetius' Treatise on Man, vol. 1. p. 77. \u2014 The observations here made on the Savoyards, are applicable to the Gallicians or Gallegos in Spain, and, in some measure, to the lower classes of the Scotch and Irish, who emigrate to England or America to ameliorate their circum stances."], [314, "284 EDUCATION AND HABII. less than we are aware of; and the difference of genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions when grown up. to matu rity, is not, upon many occasions, so much the cause as the effect of the division of labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a com mon street porter for example, seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit and education. When they came into the world, and for the first five or six years of their existence, they were, perhaps, very much alike ; and neither their parents nor play-fel lows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after, they came to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents begins then to be noticed, and widens, by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is scarcely willing to ac knowledge any resemblance.5'* Mr. Playfair, however, is far from laying so much stress on education, and so little on natural genius, and observes, \"That the greatest inventors have seldom been educated to the art or science in which they have made improvements.\"-]' The historian of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, seems to ascribe intellectual attain- * Smith's Wealth of Nations, vol.

These, however, are extraordinary cases, which cannot establish any general theory. Besides this, they refer less to that general education which involves and combines the whole series of human observations and experience through- out life, than to juvenile instruction and pro- gress in letters and liberal arts. In acquiring these accomplishments, genius may sometimes owe all its success to its own powers, but it is always indebted to circumstances for calling them into exertion ; and education greatly facilitates its efforts. \" Without fair cultures kind parental aid, Without enlivening suns and genial showers, And shelter from the blast, \u2014 in vain we hope The tender plant should raise its blooming head, Or yield the harvest promis'd in tbe spring.

These last observations apply to individuals rather than to states ; but it must be allowed that individuals are the materials of which nations are composed. Habits of life are of great importance to communities, as they have an equal influence on the mind and the body, and may either diminish or augment the strength of the state. This the Gieek and Roman legislators very well knew ; and they diligently studied not only to keep up the patriotism and courage of the people by every art of religion and policy, but also to increase their strength and activity by public games and gymnastic exercises. For these a late British senator of distinguished abilities and eminence, was a strenuous advocate. But while every philosophical statesman must approve the general principle, few, perhaps, will agree with Mr. Windham, in imagining that pu gilism must contribute to form a martial people. \" A smart contest this,\" says he, \"between Madox and Richman : why are we to boast so much of the valour of our troops as shewn at Talavera, at Vimiera, and at Maida, and yet to discourage all the practices and assertion. \" The influence of a polite age, and the labours of an atten tive education, had never been able to infuse into the rude and brutish mind of Commodus, the least tincture of learning ; and the son of the philosophical Marcus Aurelius, was the first of the Roman emperors that was totally devoid of taste for the pleasures of the understanding.\" Dec.

But he asks, whether habits and institutions, of one sort, have not a ten dency to produce it more than others? \" Courage,\" he observes, \" does not arise from the mere beating or being beaten, but from the sentiments excited by the contemplation and cultivation of such practices ; and will it, says he, make no difference in the mass of the people, whether their amusements be all of a pacific and pleasurable nature, or of a sort that calls forth a continued admiration of prowess and hardihood ?''* But popular di versions may be pacific without being effemi nate.

The Romans regarded the combats of gladiators as a neces sary stimulant to excite the courage of the citizens, and inspire them with martial senti ments by accustoming them to scenes of blood and slaughter ; but Gibbon has very justly observed, that this theory is confuted by the valour and heroism of ancient Greece and modern Europe. It is difficult, indeed, to conceive how courage could be acquired by sitting in safety in the amphitheatre, to see gladiators hew each other to pieces ; for the bold and the brave can never adopt the senti ments expressed in these verses of Lucretius, \" Suave mari magno turbantibus \u00e6quora ventis E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem.\" Such feelings are more congenial to a selfish and effeminate than to a generous and manly disposition. Bodily strength and activity, and a capa bility of supporting fatigue, qualifications absolutely necessary for a military life, depend almost entirely on habit and exercise. The savage, exercised in hunting, is more swift in the chace than the civilized man : the superior agility of the former, as well as the various knowledge ef the latter, is the effect of habit. There is no reason to suppose that an ancient"], [319, "289 EDUCATION AND HABIT. Roman was naturally stronger than an English man of the present age ; but by the use of vigor ous exercise and severe discipline, the Roman legionaries were able to perform the longest marches, although carrying burdens that would oppress the weakness of the modern soldier. The human body is a machine of curious construction : the vigour and perfec tion of its movements depend on due tension, and may be impaired or even destroyed by neglect and relaxation. A slender aud diminu tive porter or miller, is by habit often rendered capable of carrying burdens that would press many an athletic nobleman to the ground, and a Hercules would lose all his strength and even the power of motion, by remaining in a state of continual repose. Cards, dice, and all other sedentary games ought to be discountenanced by every person of taste, and by every friend of his country. They agitate and fatigue the mind without contributing to its improvement ; and they consume a portion of time that might be much better employed in useful studies or salubrious exercises.* Popular diversions ought to be calculated to display and increase activity, * It is not intended to include in this description, the amusements of the theatre.

Such were the gymnas- tic and equestrian exercises used by the Greeks in all their cities, as well as at the Isthmean, Nemean, and Olympic games.* In order to render a nation warlike and great, it is requi- site to inspire the mass of the people with the spirit of patriotism, and a habitual esteem for fame. This, perhaps, could not be better effected than by an extensive establishment of military schools, and inviting all young men to learn the science of tactics, and inure them- selves to discipline, by proposing honorary re- wards to those who excel. The effects of such a system may be, in some measure, estimated by considering the alacrity with which so great a number of the militia in the late war volunteered into the line.

The Gothic tribes differed but little from each other in their ideas and manners.

But its effects are always the most conspicuous amongst barbarians, whose reasoning faculties are dull, whose ima ginations are lively and ardent, and their pas sions easily excited. Among civilized men its influence is less perceptible, as these require arguments and proofs rather than rapturous excitement, and examine the rationality of motives and the probability of success, before they determine on action. The effect which poetry produces, does not arise from the mere passive perception of the images which it pre sents, nor from the sentiments which it incul cates, but from the excitement which it gives to the natural activity of the mind. It operates by giving an impulse to the current of thought and feeling, by awakening in the mind a train of lively emotions, and by exciting the imagination to work out a tissue of im pressive ideas, borrowed from the circum stances of life, and deriving their colouring from strong passions or powerful affections. When the song of the poet is the echo of familiar feelings, it diffuses a train of affecting movements throughout the imagination.

Their genius and character, as well as the reverence paid to their office, have been suffi ciently illustrated. But we cannot so easily express or even conceive the martial enthu siasm which they kindled in the minds of men accustomed to war and carnage, and delighting in deeds of arms. Among a polished people, a taste for poetry is cultivated rather to amuse the fancy than to excite the passions of the soul. And yet, when in calm retirement, we peruse the combats described by Homer and Tasse, we are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour. But how faint, how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary study ! It was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days, she ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but animating strains. The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song ; and the pas sions which it tended to excite, the desire of"], [331, "LETTERS AND ARTS. 301 fame, and the contempt of death, were the habitual sentiments of a German mind.\"* It is scarcely possible to conceive a more just idea of the different impressions made by poetry on the minds of barbarians and on those of polished men, than that which may be formed from this lumiuious representation. With the religion, warfare, politics, and manners of the Scandinavians, poetry was closely connected : their glory and happiness rested on its basis. To preserve and perpe tuate the memory of martial exploits beyond the short period of human existence, was an object of primary importance among the war riors of ancient times. The hope of holding an honourable place in the minds of future generations, animated the patriots and heroes of Greece and Rome ; and the same passion prevailed in its full force among the northern barbarians. To the powers of poetry, to the martial song of the Scald, the dying warrior looked up for the perpetuity of his fame, and few nations have cultivated this art with sreater enthusiasm than the Scandinavians, few with more energy and effect. t \" The theme was glorious war, the dear delight.

The influence of Scandinavian poetry was heightened by its celestial origin. A deity called Braga, residing in the palace of Valhalla, was supposed to preside over poetry and music, and to inspire the Scalds, whose war songs were characterised by a gigantic and savage sublimity, corresponding with their terrific and sanguinary religion. No warrior undertook a military expedition without being attended by his Scalds, who were employed to record his exploits and to animate his soldiers.* To their war songs the Scandinavian hero was indebted for his fame ; and to acquire this poetical immortality, together with the felicity expected in the halls of Odin, he exposed his life with an enthusiasm and intrepidity un known to modern times. After the northern nations were converted to Christianity, and had made some progress in civilization, their manners became less savage and sanguinary. Their poetry also took a milder colouring from the change in their social circumstances. The wild and horrific sublimity of the poems of Scandinavia was succeeded by the more pleasing charms of minstrelsy. But established customs are not readily abolished, nor ancient notions easily * Partholinus De Cause Contemp. Mortis a Danis. lib 1. chap. 8.

The minstrels of the middle ages, like the Celtic bards, and the Scalds of Scan dinavia, were retained by princes and feudal chiefs, not only to record their genealogies, to celebrate their achievements, and sing their praises, but also to excite the courage of their soldiers and vassals. Talliefer, a famous minstrel, accompanied William the Conqueror at the battle of Hastings, and marched at the head of the Norman troops singing the song of Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver.* The twelfth and thirteen centuries were the most splendid era of the minstrels ; but they flourished during several successive ages.-)- The manners of the times and the genius of poetry, however, were changed by the progress of civilization, and the beneficent influence of Christianity. Generosity began to be blended with valour, and compassion to be considered as the concomitant of courage. The song of the minstrel, though hurling defiance at the enemies of his chieftain, breathed sentiments of mercy to those who submitted to his arms, and exhibited none of those horrid pictures of indiscriminate carnage, rapine, and devasta tion, which characterised the poetry of Scan dinavia. \u2022 Ellis' Specim.

The bards and harpers of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, held the same rank and per- formed the same office as the minstrels in England and on the continent. Of these, the Welsh bards have obtained the greatest celeb- rity. Aided by the prophecies of Merlin, they animated their countrymen to a success- ful stand, in the fastnesses of their mountains, against the Saxon and afterwards the Norman power, till Edward I. reduced them to sub jection.* Their songs, like those of the min- strels, were tempered with the spirit of Chris- tianity, and no longer exhibited the sanguinary features of the original Celtic poetry ; but the}' were of a sufficiently martial cast to in- spire the people with all the ardour of courage and patriotism. The effects of poetry and music on the minds of the Highlanders, have been remarked by a number of writers. \"It^is not to be imagined,\" says Mrs. Murray, \" what an effect the G\u0153lic music has upon Highlanders ; when rowing, grinding, fulling, or at other laborious works, their tunes and songs seem to invigorate every nerve in their bodies. \"-j- Sounds and * Mr. Jones explodes the generally received opinion that Fdward T. made a general massacre of the Welsh bards.

Images which find \" a mirror in every mind,\" and sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo, cannot fail of making a deep impression. From such images and such sentiments, associated with known and familiar scenes, .the famous song called \" Ranee de Vac/ies\" derives its influence on the minds of the Swiss soldiers in foreign service. This poetical composition, although it abounds in vivid and affecting imagery, would be read by a native of any other country without extraordinary emotion ; but its effects on the Swiss soldiers in foreign countries, especially on the young recruits, are so im pressive, that before the revolution it was forbid to be sung in their regiments in the service of France.

This kind of mental disease, which the French call \" Maladie du pais,'* often admits of no other method of cure than that of indulging the young soldier with a furlough to revisit his native land and the scenes of his juvenile life. This celebrated song, the whole of which is too long to insert, commences in the following manner : \u2014 Quand reverrai je en quelquejour Tons les objets de mon amour } Nos clairs ruisseaux, Nos coteaux, Nos liameau.v, Nos montaignes, Et 1' ornement de nos montaignes La gentille Isabeau, A 1' ombre d' un ormeau, Quand danserai jeau son du chalumeau, &c. The following is as literal a translation as the genius of French and English poetry will admit ; \u2014 Oh ! When shall I return (o see All the objects dear to me ? Our lofty hills, Our chrystal rills, Our cots upon the mountain's tide. Oh ! When with Isabel so gay Our hamjets joy and pride, Shall 1 dance the roundelay, Beneath the shade of elm tree high, To ihe flutes soft melody ? &c. From this specimen, the reader will readily seethe general tendency of this affecting song, which displays, throughout, the same pic-"], [337, "307 LETTERS AND ARTS. turesque images, and the same train of roman tic sentiment. But a native of a another country will not easily conceive how powerfully it strikes the imagination of a Swiss, in some situations. This is, perhaps, the only instance of modern poetry producing so powerful and singular effects. Its influence appears to be derived from the local peculiarities of the country to which it refers, and to the social circumstances of its inhabitants. Switzerland resembles the highlands of Scotland ; but its features are more gigantic : many of its dis- tricts, inclosed by prodigious mountains, amidst the roar of cataracts, and all the grand scenery of nature, seem to be secluded from the rest of the world. From the simple habits of domestic life, in these sequestered recesses, the natives acquire a peculiar cast of ideas and character. When a Swiss recruit arrives in France, the romantic scenery of his native vallies vanishes from his eyes, but remains impressed on his memory and imagination, and closely associated with domestic recollections. The restraints also and regular discipline of the military life are widely different from the simple and uncontrolled habits of his early youth, and render him more feelingly sensible of his change of countrj'. A song, therefore, which presents a train of images borrowed u 2"], [338, "308 LETTERS AND ART9. from the scenes of his former life, and coloured from kindred affections, strike- all the chords of his soul, and makes on his mind a deep impression. Popular songs are the species of poetry which, in every country, has the most power ful and the most extensive influence. They are diffused among all classes of the people : they animate the mariner on board of his vessel, the mechanic in his workshop, and the peasant in following his plough. The songs and ballads of a country influence the morals and manners, and even the principles of its inhabitants, as much, perhaps, as any adven titious circumstance whatever, if we except its religion, its Jaws, and its political revolutions ; and some writers even exclude these exceptions. Every one, who has had the opportunity, must have observed how greatly the impure and bacchanalian songs of the debauchee contri bute to inspire a taste for licentious profligacy, and how much pious hymns stir up the mind to devotion. A very little more than half a century ago, the popular songs \" The High land-Laddie,\" \" Over the Water to Charley,\" with others of the same treasonable tendency, served to keep up the spirits of the jacobite party, whose infatuated adherents hoped to o ert-urn the most beneficent dynasty that has ever reigned over England, and to restore to"], [339, "LETTERS AND ARTS. 309 the throne a family which had always been hostile to liberty. The loyal and patriotic compositions \" God save the King,\" \"Rule Britannia,\" &c. both' attest and excite the attachment of Britons to their monarch and their country. The Marseillois hymn, and the animated tune of \" Ca ira,\" with other republican airs and songs, contributed to im pel the people of revolutionary France to rush upon every daring enterprise, and upon every clime.* Dramatic poetry, though less diffused than that of popular ballads, has, in every nation, a powerful influence on a very considerable part of the community. The theatrical re presentations which obtain, in any country, the greatest popularity', not only exhibit a tolerably just criterion of the national taste, but also contribute to form the national cha racter. In France, about the commencement of the revolution, the dramatic pieces were, for the most part, of a tendency hostile to mo narchy ; and the enthusiastic applause be stowed on the republican characters of Greece and Rome, indicated the state of the public mind. During .the republican period, the stage was entirely under the influence and * It would be amusing, and not uninstructivc, to peruse a collection of the popular songs of the different nations of l-'.urope during the late convulsions."], [340, "310 LETTERS AND ARTS. direction of the government; and the numer ous theatres of Paris served to inspire their crowded assemblies with sentiments of eternal enmity to kings. The imperial sway of Napo lean effected another change ; and every thing of a republican tendency was banished from the stage. Every change in the government of France was immediately preceded or fol lowed by a corresponding revolution in the drama. Poetry is the most impressive when accom panied by music. The Hebrew psalms had this advantage, which gave them an additional force in exciting the mind to devotion in the worship of the creator. The lyric composi tions of the Greeks, besides having sublimity and beauty to strike the soul and win the affec tions, possessed also the advantage of musical accompaniments, admirably adapted to increase the animation which they kindled. And they were usually exhibited at solemn festivals and public rejoicings, where the splendour, the bustle, and parade of the scene concurred to awaken the strongest emotions of patriotism. The power of sounds is known in all nations whether barbarous or civilized. The mode of their operation is a mysterious problem in physics ; but their effect is sufficiently ascer tained and deeply felt ; and it is evident that nature has connected with them certain emo-"], [341, "311 LETTERS AND ARTS. tions which excite or allay all the passions of the soul. In some instances, simple sounds produce as powerful effects as the most laboured compositions. The American savages are ex- cited to battle and carnage by the war whoop, in the same manner as were the ancient Celts and Scandinavians by the war songs of their bards and their Scalds. From this principle it proceeds, that all civilized nations have their military music so animating to the mind of the soldier, while the savage tribes supply, by tremendous shouts, the want of musical in struments and skill. Amongst enlightened and polished nations, poetry and every species of literature have a powerful but generally a beneficial effect. Besides transmitting to posterity illustrious names and noble actions, letters are the re pository of the arts and sciences, diffusing them to an unlimited extent, and facilitating their constant improvement, by collecting and perpetuating the discoveries and experience of successive generations. Literature, when accompanied by genius, extends its influence over the whole intellec tual creation. \" How incredible,\" says Mr. Young, \" is the power of great talents ! How many women, fair as Laura, have been loved as tenderly ; but wanting a Petrarch to illus trate the passion, have lived and died in"], [342, "312 LETTERS AND ARTS. oblivion, whilst his lines, not written to die, conduct thousands, under the impulse of feel ings which genius only can excite, to mingle, in idea, their melancholy sighs with those of the poet, who consecrated these remains to immortality.\"* The same writer, in speaking of the fountain of Vaucluse, and the ruin, called by the common people \" Le Chateau de Petrarch,'' makes a judicious and tasteful remark on the animation which literary talents are capable of giving to inanimate objects. \" The scene/' says he, \" is sublime ; but what renders it truly interesting, is the celebrity which great talents have given it. The power of rocks, and water, and mountains, even in their boldest features to arrest attention and fill the breast with touching sensations, is not derived from inanimate nature. To give energy to such sensations, it must receive ani mation from the creative touch of a vivid fancy. Described by the poet, or connected with the residence, actions, passions, or pursuits of great genius, it lives as it were personified by talents, and commands the interest that breathes around whatever is consecrated by fame.\"t Genius and talents often require the foster ing aid of opulence and power, especially in * A.

In England, learning of every kind was honoured at the courts of Elizabeth and her successor James I. and was encouraged both by the patronage and the example of these sovereigns. The effects of this encour ment were sufficiently conspicuous. During the short period of seventy years, which elapsed from the middle of Elizabeth's reign to the restoration, flourished many of the greatest men that England ever produced. Shakespear, Bacon, Spencer, Sidney, Hooker, Taylor, Napier, Milton, Cudworth, and several others of that period, are names that would do honour to any age or nation. These writers, however, were more distinguished by original genius, depth and brilliancy of thought, energy of expression, and profound erudition, than by correctness or elegance of stile. The restoration introduced a new taste in literature, and a stile more polished and classi cal. Charles II. was a prince of some learning, as well as of natural genius, and had an elegant taste. He and his principal adherents had, during their long exile, acquired, on the con tinent, and particularly at the court of France, a correctness of stile very different from the negligent luxuriance displayed by the English writers of that age. The celebrated writers patronised by Louis XIV. inspired those' of England with the spirit of emulation ; and"], [345, "LETTERS AND ARTS. 315 the stile introduced at the restoration, cultiva ted and improved by Dryden, Pope, Addison, and others, who were carried forward by the first impulse, caused the eighteenth century to be regarded as the Augustan age of British literature. The progress of the sciences kept pace with that of letters. Halley, Flamstead, and others, made important discoveries in astronomy ; and the great Sir Isaac Newton, by establishing the theories of attraction and gravitation, as well as of light and colours, outstripped all his predecessors in natural philosophy. Letters and arts are the sources of the most permanent national glory. The ambitious politician may fancy that a lambent flame of glory will play around his name ; but when a few short years are passed, his plans and him self are laid in the dust. Soon after the death of Alexander, his empire was dismembered ; but the empire founded by Aristotle continued near twenty centuries ; and till the revival of learning, he was the intellectual dictator of Europe. The Medici, of Florence, acquired more fame from the share which they had in promoting the culture of letters and arts, than from the immense wealth which they had accumulated ; and the name of Leo X. is ren dered more illustrious by his patronage of genius, than by his possession of the chair of"], [346, "316 LETTERS AND ARTS. St. Peter. The encouragement and support which Louis XIV. afforded to learning, at the expence of only a few thousands, have shed greater lustre on his memory and on the French nation, than all his military enterprises, which cost him more than ten times as many millions. His destructive wars exhausted the resources of his country, and drew upon him the merited execration of Europe; but his patronage of letters has cast a blaze of glory around his name, twhich no clouds of envy can obscure, no power of oblivion can ever extinguish. The influence of literature, sciences, and arts on the glory of princes, on the character and cir cumstances of nations, and on the general happi ness of mankind, is extensive and powerful beyond all calculation. It may, indeed, be considered as one of the most important agents in the civilization of the human species: a higher degree of intellectual improvement is the cause of that political superiority which Europe possesses over the other quarters of the globe"], [347, "317 CHAP.

But since the downfal of the Roman empire, the policy of modern Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce than to agriculture.* The sagacious author of the \" Wealth of Nations,'' observes, \" That according to the natural order of things, the greater part of the capital of every growing society is first directed to agriculture, afterwards to manufactures, and last of all to foreign commerce. f But he says that in all the states of modern Europe this order has been, in many respects, inverted. The foreign trade of some of their cities has introduced all the finer manufactures, which, together with commerce, have given birth to the principal improvements of agriculture. The oppressions of tlie feudal system seem to have forced things into this retrograde and unnatural order. \u2014 On the dissolution of the Roman empire, the chiefs and principal leaders of the northern nations acquired or usurped vast portions of desolated lands, which having been thus monopolized, the laws of entail and primogeniture \u2014 laws unknown to the Greeks and the Romans, were established for the pre- * Smith's Wealth of Nations, vol. 1. p. 5. t Smith's Wealth of Nation:-, vol. 2. p. 83."], [350, "320 AGRICULTURE, ETC. servation of the baronial families ; and by these regulations the lands remained almost wholly in the hands of great proprietors. It must be allowed that no small part of the prosperity as well as the character of a people depends on the mode in which landed property is distributed. When the soil of a country is divided among a small number of persons, the great proprietors seldom pay much attention to the management of their estates. This negligence of owners gives rise to the rapacity of agents, and the pernicious practice of under lettering, so frequent in Ireland, Spain, and several other countries. When the profits of the land are swallowed up by a sew individuals, the great mass of the peasantry, occupying small farms under exorbitant rents, are too poor, and act on too limited a scale to make agricul tural improvements, while their abject condi tion gives a tincture of barbarism and degra dation to their character. But in regard to Dr. Smith's observations on the inversion of the natural order of agricul ture, manufactures, and commerce in Europe, it does not seem to have taken place in so great a degree as he imagines. It is certain that, in every country, agriculture must na turally and necessarily have been the first em ployment of human industry, as without it, in a greater or less degree, no people could subsist."], [351, "321 AGRICULTURE, ETC. Manufactures, at least of the coarser sort, must have come next in order; for after procuring provisions, men must in the next place, except in very warm climates, have endeavoured to provide themselves with some kind of clothing. But manufactures could not be carried on to any great extent without commerce. Few countries possess every thing necessary to the persectionof manufactures, and as few, perhaps, can afford a market sufficient for their en couragement. From these considerations it is evident, that the natural order of things, in regard to the direction of human industry, however interrupted or impeded, could never be wholly inverted by any political arrange ments ; for the call of the natural appetites is more urgent than the solicitations of fashion : the means of subsistence must be secured to men before they seek for superfluities ; and the arts of necessity are therefore, in every country, antecedent to those of conveniency and ele gance. But the attention which modern states men have generally paid to the interests of manufactures and commerce, in preference to those of agriculture, seems to be founded in the consideration that the former being of a nature more complex and more dependent on adventitious and varying circumstances, have greater need of encouragement. At the same time it must be observed, that these three great z"], [352, "322 AGRICULTURE, ETC. branches of human industry are dependent on each other for their success. The arts of civi lized life are, indeed, so intimately connected, that scarcely any one of them can be brought to a state of perfection without the aid of several others. Agriculture supplies the manu facturer with food as well as with materials. Manufactures are the chief support of com merce, and both these together afford a market for agricultural productions.* The influence of agriculture on the circum stances and character of nations is very con siderable. As a proof of its effects in regard to national prosperity, Mr. Young observes, that nine-tenths of the exports of Lombardy consist of agricultural productions; and it is worthy of notice, that although subsisting by agri culture and importing manufactures, these countries must be ranked amongst the most * The want of manufactures and commerce seems to have been one of the causes of the low state of agriculture during the middle ages, and of the famines which, as history informs us, so frequently happened. It may be objected that agriculture flourishes greatly in China, with very little aid from foreign commerce. But the Chinese have very consider able manufactures, and the inland trade of their vast empire is very extensive. Besides these considerations it must be observed, that the agriculture of China is calculated for a numerous but poor population, and carried ou in a parsimonious manner although with great assiduity. Such, indeed, must always be the case where the people are numerous and poor, and luxury is confined to a few individuals. These remarks might probably be applicable to Chaldea, Egypt, and some other countries, where agriculture is said to have been assiduously carried on without much foreign commerce."], [353, "AGRICULTURE, ETC; 323 flourishing in the world, abounding with large and magnificent towns, decorated in a manner that sets all comparison at defiance : the country every where intersected by canals for the purposes of navigation or irrigation, with splendid roads, and an immense population, is productive of such public revenues as shew that if Italy were united under one head, she would be classed among the first powers of Europe. \"When it is considered,\" says Mr. Young, \" that all this has been effected under governments not the best in Europe, when we farther reflect that England has for a century enjoyed the best government that exists, we shall be forced to confess, perhaps with as tonishment, that she has not made more con siderable advances in agriculture and in the cultivation of her territory. The wastes of the three kingdoms are enormous, and far exceed ing in proportional extent, all that are to be found in Italy, while of our cultivated districts there are but a few provinces remarkable for their improvements. Whoever has viewed Italy with any degree of attention must admit, that that isa proportion of her territory, contain ing as many people as the three British king doms, had for a century enjoyed as free a government, giving attention to what has been a principal object, (viz.) agriculture instead of trade and manufactures, they would, at this X 2"], [354, "324 AGRICULTURE, ETC. time, have made almost every acre of their country a fertile garden, and would have been in every respect a greater, richer, and more flourishing people than we can pretend to be. What they have done under their present governments justifies this assertion : we, bless ed with liberty, have little to exhibit of supe riority.'' The same writer then remarks the effects which this assiduous attention to agri culture produces on the prosperity and manners of the people, and observes, that at Lodi, a town containing ten or twelve thousand in habitants, the theatre was superb and the company elegant. \u2014 \" Water, clover, cows, cheese, money, music \u2014 these,\" says Mr. Young, \"are the combinations that string Italian nerves to enjoyment, and afford lessons of government to northern politicians.''* Since these observations were made, twenty seven yearshave elapsed ; and the improvements which have taken place in this kingdom, in the various branches of the farming business, with respect to the inclosing and draining of waste lands, the cultivation of corn, and the breeding and feeding of cattle, within this space of time, exceed every thing of the kind * Young's Trav. Journ. 11th Oct. 1789. But Mr. Young must have perceived in his travels that many parts of Europe, and even of Italy, could not by any mode of husbandry be made so productive of wealtb as the country which he is bere describing."], [355, "AGRICULTURE, ETC. 325 that had ever before been performed in a century. To Mr. Young is certainly due the credit of being one of the first who directed the attention of the proprietors and principal farmers towards these improvements, and he has lived to see a considerable part of their beneficial effects. Not only have elegant farms and commodious cottages arisen in places which, thirty years ago, were desert, but the yeomanry, the farmers, and even the labouring peasantry live in a more elegant and comfort- able stile, and are become more polished as well as more intelligent. The country has assumed a new aspect ; and the numerous class of people engaged in husbandry has assumed a new character. But the operation of so active a cause has not been confined within the limits of this island. In consequence of the flourish- ing state of agriculture, and the opulence of the landed and farming interest, compensating the defalcations in manufactures and foreign trade, the British nation has borne the burthens of a war dangerous and expensive beyond all pre cedent. By a liberal and judicious use of her treasures Great Britain has been the support of altars, of thrones, and of social order, and the animating soul of all Europe. Agriculture is the firmest basis of the strength of a state, and ought, in every country, to be held in the highest esteem, and to receive"], [356, "326 AGRICULTURE, ETC. the greatest encouragement. It is the surest and the most permanent source of wealth, and its extension is the easiest and safest of con- quests. \" The tillage of land, before waste and uncultivated, is, in every point of view, an acquisition of territory highly beneficial. Unlike distant colonies which furnish a perpe- tual pretext for hostility, lands newly cultiva- ted excite no jealousy in the neighbouring states, and can furnish no grounds for those frequent wars which are the severest scourge of mankind, and disgrace the professors of a religion founded for the express purpose of disseminating benevolence and establishing peace.\"* The products of agriculture and not the precious metals constitute the real opulence of a state. In those countries which are the richest in mines, even in Mexico, Peru, Brasil, and Golconda, the produce of the soil, in a moderate state of cultivation, is of far greater value than all the gold, silver, and diamonds that can be dug out of the earth. In almost every country, the persons en gaged in husbandry constitute the majority of the population ; and it may always be obser ved, that where agriculture flourishes, the peasantry are industrious and orderly. It seldom happens that rebellions or dangerous * Kelt's Elements, vol. 2. p. 332."], [357, "327 AGRICULTURE, ETC. commotionsoriginate among the yeomanry, the farmers, or the labourers : the two first classes are inured to peaceful habits; and they have always a great influence over those of the lowest order, who are domiciliated among them, who are dependent on them for their subsistence, and are too widely dispersed to be easily col lected in any formidable numbers. An indus trious and enlightened peasantry is one of the chief supports of a state, and forms no incon siderable feature in the character of a nation. Commerce was neglected by the Greeks and despised by the Romans; but it was early practised by the Ph\u0153nicians, the Arabians, and, in all probability, by the Egyptians and the Babylonians. The Ph\u0153nicians, seated on a narrow shred of land, extending along the coast of the Levant or Mediterranean sea, were induced, by their situation, to search for those advantages from commerce which they could not derive from the scanty produce of their confined territory. These nations being situated nearly in the centre of the old con tinent, formed the principal link of commu nication between the eastern and western countries ; and Dr. Vincent supposes the Ara bians to have been th. first carriers both by land and by sea.* From analogy, from the * Dr. Vincent's Periplus, part 2. p. 434. The Midianites who sold Joseph into Egypt, were an Arabian tribe. See Gen. chap. 37. v. 28\u201436"], [358, "328 AGRICULTURE, ETC. recorded magnificence of Nineveh and Baby lon, and from the ruins of Thebes still remain ing, there is reason to suppose, that the wealth and power of those celebrated cities were, in a great measure, owing to a participation in the oriental commerce ; and that the Arabians were the principal carriers.* The Egyptians and the Hindoos had a superstitious aversion to a seafaring life, which, indeed, was incom patible with many of their religious doctrines and practices. But the Arabians had no obstructions to travelling by sea as well as by land, either from manners, laws, or religion ; and as there is every requisite proof to shew that the Tyrians and Sidonians were the merchants who first introduced the produce of India to all the nations that encircled the Mediterranean, so there is the strongest evidence that the Tyrians obtained all these commodities from Arabia. f * From various descriptions of Babylonian magnificence and splen dour met with in scripture, that ancient city must have had a very con siderable commerce, carried on either by native or foreign merchants. Gold, silver, and various other articles of luxury, which the Babylonians as well as the Egyptians possessed, could be acquired only by conquest or commerce, as they were not found in their own territories. + Dr. Vincent's Periplus, vol. 2. p. 223. The doctor adopting the opinion of Gosselin, considers Arabia Felix as the Ophir mentioned in scripture. The evidence, that Solomon procured gold through the channel of Arabia, appears to be express; and the participation of Hiram, king of Tyre, in this concern was founded in necessity. Solo mon being master or Idumea, the Tyrians were cut off from all commu nication with Arabia, unless they united themselves with the possessor ;"], [359, "329 AGRICULTURE, ETC. The history of commerce is more instructive and entertaining than the history of conquests: it has employed several celebrated pens, and filled several ponderous volumes, without ex hausting the subject. In this place it suffices to observe, that no nation or tribe, which had raised itself in the least degree above the state of savages, ever did or ever could exist without some sort of trade however trifling and limited. The Roman citizens regarded it as a disgrace to engage in mercantile concerns ; but foreign merchants brought them their commodites, and it is evident that the luxury and splendour of Rome, when mistress of the world, could not have been supplied without an extensive commerce. This was carried on by provincial merchants; and, during several centuries, Alexandria was the principal mart for the supply of Rome with the rich commodities of Africa and the east. Commerce embellishes cities as agriculture beautifies the country. To commerce, London owes the chief part of her wealth and her splendour, and Amsterdam almost her very existence. To multiply examples would be as easy as it is unnecessary. When we con template cities rising out of forests and swamps, and whatever profit the Hebrew monarch might derive from the im port of Indian or African merchandize, the whole of the export to the Mediterranean would be to the exclusive emolument of Tyre."], [360, "330 AGRICULTURE, ETC. and displaying all the proud magnificence of trade, the interesting spectacle brings to our minds the beautiful observation of the poet, \" Aurea nunc, olim sylvestribus horrida dumis.\" Virg. Encid lib. lib. 8.-349. Commerce, although more precarious than agriculture, is an immense source of opulence : there is reason to believe that London is, at the present day, more wealthy than was ancient Rome, after plundering the world. By procuring opulence and promoting in telligence, commerce is in the highest degree favourable to freedom. The feudal system fell rapidly before its influence. Commerce, in deed, cannot co-exist with tyranny : the former must flag, or the latter must fall. It also pro motes the progress of various arts and sciences. The chief part of our geographical and nauti cal knowledge owes its origin to commercial views and motives. Commerce tends in a multiplicity of ways to extinguish barbarism and promote civilization. It weakens or annihilates narrow prejudices, extends the ideas of men, renders them citizens of the world, and inspires them with senti ments of equity. Mercantile men must, in all their transactions, display the strictest probity, without which they could not carry on any extensive concerns. They must also have laws which develope every principle of justice, and"], [361, "331 AGRICULTURE, ETC. the boundaries of right and wrong in cases the most difficult and complex. Without these a commercial community cannot subsist. Ac cordingly we find that the laws of commercial nations are always remarkable for their com plexity, and that merchants surpass most other classes of men in probity. The ancient Ligu rians were noted for stratagem, cunning, and duplicity ; but these qualities do not consti tute any part of the character of their posterity, the modern Genoese. Genoa could not have subsisted so long as a commercial state had not her merchants equalled those of other countries in probity. Great Britain is the most com mercial country in the world ; and there is none where the fair dealing of merchants, and <ven of respectable shopkeepers, is more con spicuous. Manufactures are an important branch of the commercial system ; but they are attended with inconveniences which may be regarded as no inconsiderable drawback on its advan tages. The assiduous prosecution of manu factures is injurious to the health and often to the morals of a people. Thisobservation, how ever, is not applicable to every kind of manu facturing employment. The workmen in some kinds of manufactures are as healthful and strong as the gentry or peasantry, although the truth of this position will scarcely be"], [362, "332 AGRICULTURE, ETC. allowed by writers who, following one another in the same beaten tract, form their opinions from supposition rather than observation.* The cotton manufactures, and some others of a similar nature where children are employed, may, if not properly managed, be injurious to their health and their growth ; and many con demn them as obstacles to the instruction of the rising generation, by putting boys and girls to manual labour, at a period of life which ought to be spent in school education. But it must be considered that the children thus employed are those of the poorest class of people, and such would certainly not receive a better education by remaining with their parents than by being employed in the manu factories. An eminent writer seems to consider trade and manufactures as hostile to vigour of mind, and obstacles to intellectual improvement. \" The shrewdness, cunning, and selfishness im puted to the people of Scotland,'' says Mr. Millar, \" are merely the unfavourable aspect of that intelligence and sagacity by which they are distinguished above the mechanical * The author has often observed, that such of the cloth, blanket, &c. manufacturers, as do not confine themselves too closely to the sedentary part of their employment, but reside chiefly in villages, and often carry their manufactures about the country to sell, are remarkably \u25a0strong and active, and capable of supporting great fatigue."], [363, "AGRICULTURE, ETC. 333 drudges in the southern part of the island, and by which they are more able to discover their own interest, to extricate themselves from diffi culties, and to act upon every occurrence with decision and prudence.\"* The same writer asserts, that in all parts of the world the great body of the people, while they remain in a state of rudeness and simplicity, are distin guished by their intelligence, acuteness, and sagacity ; and that in proportion to their ad vancement in commerce and manufactures they become ignorant, narrow minded, and stupid. -j- The whole of this hypothesis appears to be erroneous, and may easily be confuted by a little inquiry and observation. No persons display greater sagacity in discovering their own interests, or pursue them with greater prudence and activity than the higher class of manufacturers. The workmen, also, those whom Millar calls the mechanical drudges, are at least as acute and intelligent as the lower class of the peasantry of Scotland, or perhaps of any other country. The working manufacturers are certainly less temperate than the labourers in husbandry, and in times of civil commotions they are also more turbulent and dangerous. Their intem perance proceeds from their being able to earn \u00bb Millar Hist. Eng. Gov. 3\u2014 p. 92. + Millar Hist. Eug. Gov. 3\u2014 p. 91."], [364, "334 AGRICULTURE, ETC. a great deal of money, and their turbulence from their collection in numerous bodies. The vices of manufacturers are those which natu rally arise from a numerous and concentrated population. Luxury is closely connected with commerce : indeed they are almost inseparable ; for with out the existence of the former, the latter can not flourish. If the possessors of wealth con tented themselves with the simple necessaries of life, money would always remain in the same hands, without any circulation, industry would be annhilated, and the poor would starve. It is the luxury and splendour of the great that supports the lower class of the people. Helvetius very justly observes, \" That nothing is more contradictory than the opinions of moralists on the subjects of commerce and luxury. While they agree on the utility and even the necessity of commerce in populous countries, they would, at the same time, in troduce an austerity of manners wholly incom patible with its spirit. ' The theatres, actors, and actresses, the money which they spend, and cause strangers to spend, constitute one of the most lucrative branches of the commerce of Paris.\"* Every thing that occasions a brisk circulation of money, excites industry, and Helvet'uu Treatise on Man, vol.3 p. 139."], [365, "335 AGRICULTURE, ETC. contributes to give animation to the various exertions of human ingenuity. Before the nature of commerce was well understood, sumptuary laws were frequently enacted ; but experience and reason has shewn their absurdity. Such laws, indeed, may be bene ficial to small and poor states, but they are always detrimental to great and commercial nations, and in these they are now universally abolished. Historians ascribe the downfal of most of the great empires of antiquity, to the baleful in fluence of luxury. The greater part of moral and no inconsiderable number of political writers, also consider luxury as essentially destructive of national prosperity.* But on a careful examination it will be found, that the neglect of military discipline, the despotism of their governments, the mismanagement of princes and generals, together with civil dis sentions, were the primary causes of the subver sion of ancient empires, and that foreign war and invasion commonly gave the finishing blow to their existence. Dr. Smith says, V That great nations are never impoverished by private luxury, although they sometimes are by public prodigality and misconduct. * The ancient fathers unanimously condemned luxury as contrary to the spirit of the christian religion. Vide Clemens Alexandrious P\u00e6dc gog. lib. 3. chap. S. Tertnll. de Spectacul, chap. 23."], [366, "336 AGRICULTURE, ETC. The whole, or almost the whole public re venue is, in most countries, employed in main taining unproductive hands. ' Such,' says this celebrated writer, ' are the persons who compose a numerous and splendid court, a great ecclesiastical establishment, and large fleets and armies, who, in time of war, pro duce nothing, and in time of peace acquire nothing that can compensate the expence of maintaining them. Such people, as they produce nothing, are all maintained by the product of other men's labours ; when multiplied, therefore, to an unnecessary num ber, they may, in a particular year, consume so great a share of this produce, as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the productive labourers who should reproduce it in the next year.\"* But the accurate observer will readily per ceive, that here Dr. Smith overstrains his subject. His hypothesis can extend only to the lower orders in the church, the army, and the navy. If the common soldiers and sailors were not in the service of the state, they would certainly be employed in agriculture, mechani cal trades, or manufactures, and would conse quently increase the number of productive labourers; but Dr. Smith's observations can- * Wealth of Nations, vol. 2. p. 22."], [367, "AGRICULTURE, ETC. 337 not be applicable to the chief officers of the nrmy and navy, nor to the heads of the hier archy, who are most of them gentlemen or nobles by birth, and still less to the persons composing a numerous and splendid court. None of these would have been engaged in agriculture, manufactures, or trade. They would have supported themselves on the in come of their estates ; and if the salaries which they receive be paid by the public, they are, by this means, enabled to live in a higher stile of expence. They consequently return to the' nation the sums which they receive, and thus increase the circulation of money, and animate the efforts of industry. It is certain, however, that the luxury of courts may be carried to a ruinous extent. By oppressing the people it may check instead of promoting industry, and thus contribute to degrade the national character. If it be true that a thousand barbers, a thousand cup bearers, and a thousand cooks were maintained in the court of the emperor Constantius, if one of those barbers, besides a large salary, had a daily allowance for twenty horses, and for the same number of servants, if, in fine, the domestic crowd of the imperial palace was maintained at a greater expence than the legions,* it is no wonder that the empire was Gibbon Dec. Rom. Emp. vol. 4, chap, 22. p. 42\u201443. Y"], [368, "338 AGRICULTURE, ETC beginning to sink into debility, and the cha racter of the people into degradation. Luxury, whether public or private, contri butes to the prosperity of the state, in propor tion to the excitement which it gives to indus try and ingenuity. In proportion also to its grossness or its refinement, it tends to elevate or to degrade the national character. One of the most useless kinds of luxury, is the main tenance of a great number of idle domestics, as it is too much the fashion in several European countries, particularly in Spain and Italy : the most beneficial is that which gives the most employment to labourers, artizans, and manu facturers. In regard to this kind of luxury, money may be expended either in articles which are almost immediately consumed, or in things more durable, such as superb gardens and pleasure grounds, magnificent buildings, fine paintings, and statues. These may be accumulated to an indefinite extent ; and after calling into action a large portion of ingenuity and industry, they remain articles of real wealth in the hands of the owner, and a lasting source of national profit. Such was the luxury of the Italian princes and nobles in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and its effects are still conspicuous. Italy, by possessing so many monuments of art, has long commanded the veneration of Europe, and gained millions of"], [369, "Agriculture, etc. 339 money by the visits of strangers.* Luxury, Whenever it takes this direction, not only encourages genius and industry, but refines and embellishes national character. * In the late revolutionary wars, Italy lost many of her master pieces of art, which were carried to Paris, but enough still remained to gratify Curiosity and delight taste. At the late peace, however, all or most of the finest pictures and statues were restored to the countries from which they had been pillaged. Y 2"], [370, "340 CHAP. X. WAR and MILITARY DISCIPLINE. War is the misfortune and disgrace of the human species, and the greatest blemish in the moral system of the world. Since men were collected into political societies, its opera tions have been almost incessant ; and so long as mankind shall exist upon earth, its returns will be frequent. It originates from an inex haustible source, \u2014 from thepassions and errors of the human race ; and unless the nature of man should undergo a total change, hostile armies will still continue to tinge the earth with blood. In well regulated communities, the disputes of individuals are determined, and their passions restrained by laws; but when quarrels arise between independent states, there is no supreme tribunal upon earth to which they can appeal : the decision must, therefore, be left to the sword, which has been emphatically called \" Ultima ratio regum,57 the last argument of kings."], [371, "WAR, ETC. 341 Successful war has generally obtained the applause of mankind. It has been bedizened with the most magnificent epithets of every language, and has procured for some men the idolatry of the world. The Macedonian Alexander makes a brilliant figure in history ; but to form that hero, more than a million of men were immolated at the shrine of his ambition ;* and the career of Julius C\u00e6sar was marked by as great a destruction of human life. Notwithstanding the pompous relations of victories and triumphs, it must be considered, that the business of war is destruc tion and carnage, and that the splendour with which it is emblazoned, resembles the gilding of those hideous idols to whom barbarous nations offered human sacrifices.-)\" No delusion was ever more pernicious than that which has invested conquerors with a sort of supernatural grandeur, which imposes on the public mind, and tricks the idols out with the mock attributes of divinity as if they were justly intitled to the homage of mankind.

In perusing with the least degree of attention the annals of the world, we must readily perceive that war is the most prolific of all moral evils, the most direful scourge of the human race, and a source more productive of calamity than famine or pestilence. That illustrious orator, Edmund Burke, computes, but certainly with much exaggeration, the carnage made by war and its consequences at seventy times the number of men now upon earth.* On contemplating the ensanguined fields where murderous battles have been fought, the moral philosopher, however he may admire the valour or skill of the combatants, will be ready to exclaim with Catullus, \" Troja nefas, commune sepulchrum Asi\u00e6 Europaeque: \" Troja virum et virtutum omnium acerba cinis.\" \" Accursed Troy of Europe's sons the grave, Of Asia's noblest chiefs the common tomb Where rest the ashes of the wise and brave.\" or to adopt the language of Lord Byron, \" There shall they rot, ambition's honoured fools !

When we reflect on the miseries inflicted and the happiness prevented by war, we should be astonished that neither the progresses civiliza- tion, the reasonings of philosophy, nor the influence of Christianity has eradicated an evil of so tremendous a magnitude, if experience did not shew that it is inseparably connected with the nature and circumstances of man, The promoters and conductors of wars are far from being the most ferocious and cruel of their species. Men delight in war notwith standing the miseries of which it is productive, because it exercises all the talents and calls forth all the energies of human nature, and gratifies their pride and ambition by holding peopled as at present, which it would be absurd to suppose, and the half of every generation had perished by war and its consequences, Mr. Burke's estimate must be erroneous."], [374, "344 \"WAR, ETC. them up as conspicuous objects of public at tention. These motives, however, will not justify their conduct in the sight of the com mon father of mankind. If nations adhered to the principles of equity and the precepts of the christian religion, few political quarrels would arise that might not be adjusted without draw ing the sword. War almost always implies enormous guilt either on one side or the other : it can never be justifiable unless undertaken for the defence of national rights ; and a dread ful responsibility rests on the heads of those. who commence hostilities from sinister motives. But the moral philosopher who takes an ex tensive survey of human circumstances will find some difficulty in adopting the opinions of two celebrated writers, who involve in the same responsibility subjects and soldiers as well as the rulers of states and the commanders of armies. Grotius, speaking of subjects, says, that \" If they be required to take arms which frequently happens, and it appears to them that the cause of the war is unjust, they ought absolutely to refuse.''* With this doctrine of Grotius Mr. Gisborne's opinion perfectly coin- cides.

Peace and war depend on the will of human societies, and that will is the source of all political and legislative regulations. How far men are bound to comply with their public obligations when they clash with their private duties may sometimes appear a difficult question. In the case of a subject engaging iu war, the problem will be the most easily solved by considering the comparative certainty and uncertainty of public and private duties when they come into opposition, and the liberty of choice that is left to the agent. Amidst the endless combinations of political affairs, and the contradictory declarations, pretensions, and manifestos of statesmen, of persons who, from their habits of office and their opportunities of information, ought, in these matters, to be the most competent judges, and all of whom assert, in the presence of God and of the world, the justice of their cause, it is absolutely impossible to men of ordinary capacity or know ledge, and often difficult to those of the greatest abilities * Gisb.

But if the difficulty of deciding on the justice or injustice of a war be so great, obedience to the laws of the state, of which we are members and from which we receive protection, is a duty so obvious that, in affairs merely temporal, it can never admit of any doubt. Unless this fundamental principle be established, all laws must be nugatory and all government must sink into anarchy. So far therefore as the laws of his country command, either in civil or military matters, the subject is bound toobey \u2014 where they are silent, his conduct is left to his own discretion and choice. If the laws of the state require a certain proportion of the people to arm, an individual, on whom the lot falls, is not to consider whether the war be just or unjust : his obvious duty is to perform the part of a soldier. But if a person be left to his choice, he ought, before he engages in war, to examine, as far as his means of information allow, the justice of the cause in which he is going to fight, and regulate his decision accord- ing to the dictates of his conscience, otherwise he cannot stand acquitted of murder before the tribunal of that supreme judge who has declared, that \" at the hand of every man's brother he will require the life of man.''* * Gen. chap. 9tb, v. 5th, 6th."], [377, "WAR, ETC. 347 It has been observed, that were Engrland again divided as under the heptarchy, the inhabitants of Kent might be called on to slaughter those of Essex ; and from this it is inferred, that right and wrong must be estima- ted by a more steady criterion than the change- able standards of human societies. The circum- stance here supposed, indicates the unhappy condition of a country divided into a number of petty states : but has no relation to the justice or injustice of political contests. The British channel and the Pyrennees are not boundaries in morals, any more than the Thames; and if the heptarchy yet existed, the people of Kent might, with a,s much justice, cut the throats of the people of Essex, as the inhabitants of France can slaughter those of England or Spain. In order to form just estimates of things, we must reason without passion or prejudice \u2014 without giving way to feelings excited by present circumstances. The world has long been accustomed to admire the heroic patriotism of Greece and Rome ; but we must recollect that, excepting the Persian wars, and some expeditions to Sicily, the heroism of the Greeks, and also of the Romans, during the first ages of their political existence, was exercised solely in butchering their nearest neighbours. Neither Attica, Laconia, nor any other of the Grecian"], [378, "348 WAR, ETC, states comprised so much territory as some of the English counties. The dominions of Rome were, for a long time, still more con tracted, and nearly four centuries after her foundation, did not equal, in extent, several of the kingdoms of the Saxon heptarchy. War, unless when absolutely necessary for the maintenance of national rights, is the greatest solecism in politics. \" It is impossi ble,\" says Mr. Young, \"to view such admir able works as the quay of Barcelona, without regretting the enormous sums wasted in war and bloodshed. No quarrel happens between two nations without costing twenty such quays, a thousand miles of magnificent road, a hun dred bridges, the pavements, lights, fountains, palaces, and public ornaments of fifty cities. ********** ****** **** A very little calculation would shew that the expence of our three last wars, which had no effect whatever than to spill blood and fill gazettes, would have made the whole island of Great Britain a garden, its whole coast a quay, and have converted all the houses of her towns into palaces, and her cottages into houses.\"* These reflections are calculated to make a strong impression : they merit attention, and require some comment. It must be observed, * Young's Travels, July IT, 1787."], [379, "349 WAR, ETC. that imperious circumstances too often render war a measure of necessity. Preservation is as requisite as acquisition. It would be useless to construct these quays, roads, bridges, &c. without endeavouring to secure the possession, and unfortunately this can be effected only by arms. Such is the state of things in this world, that if any nation should disclaim all resistance to hostile aggression, its magnificence, its wealth, and all its advantages would only con tribute to render it a more tempting object to a warlike and ambitious neighbour. This is a conclusion which may be drawn from all that is known of human affairs, \u2014 from the history of mankind in all ages. It must, indeed, be allowed, that if men were invariably guided by the principles of justice, reason, and reli gion, wars might be avoided ; but if such were the case, laws would scarcely be necessary, The disputes arising from ignorance and un avoidable mistakes, the natural effects of hu man weakness and imperfection, would, in pub lic affairs, be almost always terminated without bloodshed, and in private concerns without litigation. Mr. Young's observations, how ever, merit the attention not only of princes and ministers, but also of the people of every country. Historians and moralists have adopt ed the fashion of attributing the calamities of war to the ambition of kings ; but they may,"], [380, "350 WAR, ETC; perhaps, be oftener ascribed to the interested views of subjects. Mr. Young himself gives an instance of the eagerness of the democratic class for war, when it seems to favour their interests. At Lisle, and several other places in France and Flanders, he found the people, at the commencement of the revolution, clamor ous for a war with England, because they ap prehended that the commercial treaty then existing, would ruin their manufactures. \" These people,\" says Mr. Young, \" have the true monopolizing ideas : they would involve twenty-four millions of people in the certain miseries of war, rather than see the interest of those who consume fabrics, preferred to the interests of those who make them.''* In all countries, whether the government be free or despotic, some regard is paid to public opinion. Few wars have ever been long car ried on without the approbation of the people. Even in Turkey the government turns its thoughts towards peace, when the continuance of hostilities becomes unpopular at Constanti nople. A war was seldom proposed by the senates of Athens, Laced\u00e6mon, or Rome, with out meeting with the ready approbation of the people. -f No reader of history is ignorant * Young's Travels in France, p. 69. t Thucydides notices the eagerness of the people both of Attica and of the Peloponnesus to commence that war which proved so detrimen tal to Greece. Thucydides Bell, Peloponness. lib. 2. chap. 8,"], [381, "351 WAR, ETC of the ardou-r displayed by the English in their attempts to place Edward III. and Henry V. on the throne of France. The undertaking was not less impolitic than impracticable, as its success must have reduced England to the condition of a French province; yet oceans of blood were spilt in the contest. So strangely, indeed, were the people of England fascinated by this absurd project, that all the disasters of the reign of Henry VI. could not cure them of their infatuation; and the succeeding monarchs, Edward IV. Henry VII. and Henry V1I1. could never devise a readier or more effectual expe dient for procuring money from their subjects, than that of pretending to make preparations for the conquest of France. History also shews, that monarchical governments have not been more addicted to war than republics. Moralists may, therefore, cease to declaim ag inst the ambition of kings, when they re flect on the madness of nations. It would be absurd to ascribe to any parti cular class of men, rather than to the depravity of human nature, and the difficulty of human circumstances, the existence of so deplorable an evil. Man is a restless animal : the first man that was bora kided the second ; and war seems to be congenial to the nature and cir cumstances ot his present condition. It ap pears, indeed, to be one of the wise dispense-"], [382, "352 WAR, ETC. tions of providence which ordains, that the inordinate passions of man should produce their own punishment. The grand principle of the divine government is the amelioration of the state of mankind ; but thedevelopement of this fundamental law, is a most awful mystery, which darkens our view of the moral economy of the world. In our present state of existence, we are no better judges of the reasons for which evils are permitted by the ruler of the universe, than a child is of the propriety of correction by the hand of an affectionate parent. In taking an extensive view of the moral system, we shall perceive that the causes of war may, in a great measure, be traced to two very opposite propensities of human nature, a mischievous idleness, and a restless activity. How paradoxical soever it may appear, it is certain that idleness, not that kind indeed which consists in absolute inaction, but that which is opposite to steady and persevering industry, is often a secret cause of great effects. Mankind in general are more or less addicted to this kind of idleness, as may be observed in. all savage or barbarian tribes ; and, although in civilized nations, this propensity may be strongly counteracted by views of interest or the power of habit, yet, in every country, great numbers of men prefer the hardships and"], [383, "353 WAR, ETC. dangers of a military life, to the steady exer- tions of labour in agricultural, mechanical, or manufacturing employments. This is evident from the consideration, that in every country where the trumpet has been sounded for war, an army has been speedily collected. The author of the \" Wealth of Nations'' ascribes to a different cause, the readiness with which the lower class of people engage in a military life. \" What a common soldier may lose,\" says he, \" is obvious enough. Without regard- ing the danger, however, young volunteers never inlist so readily as at the beginning of a war ; and although they have scarcely any chance of preferment, they figure to themselves, in their youthful fancies, a thousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction, which never occur. These romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is less than that of common labourers ; and in actual service, their fatigues are much greater.\"* But his commentator says, \"Mr. Smith is mistaken in attributing the facility with which young men inlist for soldiers to ambition or the hope of good luck. Vanity and laziness are the two passions which chiefly act in this case : the soldier goes cleaner and better dressed than the artisan or labourer : he has \u2022 Smith's Wealth of Nations, vol. I. p. 171, &c. 2"], [384, "354 War, etc. little to do, and leads an idle life, the hard ships of which are concealed.\"* A little observation will suffice to shew that this is a tolerably just estimate of the motives which most commonly impel men to crowd the ranks of an army. The mirth and jollity of recruit ing parties, the power of intoxicating liquors, and the animating sounds of martial music, also contribute to produce this effect. In the days of youth, when the heart bounds with careless hilarity, the imagination is easily over powered by gay and splendid illusions. But the love of action and enterprise, and the aversion to steady and persevering industry, which are the usual characteristics of that period of life, are the principal causes that drive men from their homes and peaceful oc cupations into the ensanguined field, \" Where thousands fall to deck one single name.\" The ranks of an army would be slowly filled by those who are induced to engage in war by rapturous anticipations of honours and dis tinction. The mode in which war has been carried on by different nations, constitutes no inconsi derable feature in their character, and the advantages or defects of their military systems have had a conspicuous influence on their cir- * Playfair's Nffte, ibid."], [385, "WAR, ETC. 355 cumstancesi The armies of every nation were at first a militia, consisting of citizens who possessed property sufficient to enable them to defray their own expences in the camp. The citizens of all the Grecian states, served with out pay till after the Persian war, and the people of Peloponnesus retained the custom till a much later period. After the second Persian war, the armies of Athens seem to have been mostly composed of mercenary troops, consisting partly of citizens, but partly also of foreigners, and all of them paid by the state. Among the Romans the system of warfare was originally the same as that of the Grecian states. As the territory of Rome was of very narrow extent, the first wars of the Romans being confined to the adjacent neighbourhood, and carried on almost under the walls of the city, the troops could be readily supplied with all that was necessary in such operations. The citizens, therefore, served without pay, and those who were destitute of property, and con sequently unable to support themselves in war, were excluded the privilege of bearing arms. The siege of Veii, which was of ten years duration, and the unaccustomed hardships of so tedious a war, carried on at a considerable distance from home, rendered it necessary to institute a regular pay for the soldiery, levied by a just proportion on the property of the z 2"], [386, "356 War, etc. citizens.* At this time, and long afterwards, the duty of a soldier was essentially connected with that of a citizen ; and every Roman was liable to ten years of military service previous to his attaining the age of forty-five. At first the armies were recruited from the city of Rome and its territory, afterwards from the adjacent district of Latium, which had been conquered and incorporated with the republic, and of which the inhabitants had been admit ted to the rights and duties of Roman citizens. These rights being at length claimed, and obtained by all the people of Italy, necessarily involved the same duties. The armies were then levied from every part of Italy ; and at length the populace, excluded by the ancient constitution, were indiscriminately admitted by Marius.-j\" War among the Romans was then converted into a trade. Although during the last years of the republic, and in the flourishing age of the empire, the Roman armies were still, for the most part, commanded by officers of liberal birth and education, the common soldiers, like those of modern Europe, were drawn from the meanest and very fre quently from the most profligate of mankind. + But the Romans always paid great attention * Vide Liv. lib. 4 and 5. + Sallust de Bello Jugurth. t Gibbon Dec. Rom. Emp. vol. I. cap, 1. p. 15"], [387, "357 WAR, ETC. to the essential qualifications of age, strength, and stature in their levies of troops ; and they always preferred recruits taken from the labo rious employments of husbandmen, carpenters, smiths, &c. to sedentary mechanics.* Before the invention of gunpowder, bodily strength, courage, and activity, with skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, were the highest qualifications that soldiers could pos sess. But this skill and dexterity could be acquired only in the same manner as fencing is at present, by practising, not in large bodies, but each man separately under a particular master. In all the republics of ancient Greece, military exercises were an essential part of the education imposed by the state upon every citizen, and indispensably necessary to all who aspired to public employments. In or adjoining to every city, there was a public field, in which the martial youth were taught their various exercises by different masters. In ancient Rome, the exercises of the campus martins were of the same nature and answered the same purpose as those of the gymnasia in the cities of Greece. The severe discipline of the Spartans has already been described : that of the Roman armies was not inferior in rigour. Military ex- * Vegetius De Re Militare, torn. 1. cap. 2 \u2014 7."], [388, "358 WAR, ETC. ercises were their unremitted employment. Large sheds were erected in their winter quarters, that their daily exercises might meet with no interruption from the most tempestu ous weather ; and it was an invariable rule that, in this imitation of war, their arms should be double the weight of those used in real action.* Their exercises comprehended whatever could increase the strength of the body or the activity of the limbs. The soldiers were diligently taught to march, to run, to leap, to swim, to carry heavy burdens, to make various evolutions, and to bandle with dexterity every species of arms. The greatest of their generals encouraged these military exercises by their presence and example ; and the emperors Trajan and Adrian frequently condescended to instruct the inexperienced soldiers, to reward the diligent, and sometimes to dispute with them the prize of superior strength and dexterity. \"j\" In their marches, the Roman soldiers carried with them, besides their arms, their cooking utensils, their instru ments of fortification, and provisions for many days. Under this weight, which usually amounted to about sixty pounds for each soldier, they were trained to advance by a * Vegetins De Re Militare, lib. 1. + Plutarch Vita MarTi et Visa Pompeii\u2014 Gibbon Dec. Rom. Emp. vol. 1. cap. 1."], [389, "359 WAR, ETC. regular step, at the rate of about twenty miles in little more than five hours. Active courage may be the gift of nature; but the patient valour of the Romans could be only the effect of discipline and habit. The same discipline would make as good soldiers of the modern Italians. The number of soldiers which composed the legion, varied at different periods. In the most flourishing state of the empire it con sisted of six thousand one hundred infantry, and seven hundred and twenty-six cavalry. In the times of the republic, the cavalry was composed of the principal citizens; but under the emperors it was levied in all the different provinces, and formed of the same class of people as the infantry. Each legion had sixty five military engines, ten of a large and the rest of a smaller size.* The construction of the Roman legion was superior to that of any other military corps described in ancient his tory. In order of battle, it was drawn up eight deep, and the regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well as the ranks. The Macedonian phalanx was drawn up in sixteen ranks of long pikes, wedged together in the closest array, and forming an almost impenetrable mass. But when these * For a description of many of their military machines, see Cheva lier de Folard Observat. sur Polybe, torn. 2. p. 233, &c."], [390, "360 WAR, ETC. two formidable bodies came into hostile con tact, it was found that the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend with the activity of the legion.* From this very slight sketch it will be easily perceived, that the Romans made the art of war their principal study ; and history affords indisputable evidence that in its successful practice they surpassed all other nations. These circumstances contributed in no small degree to the formation and support of the Roman character. Every consideration that inspires confidence naturally increases courage ; and this cause operated on the Roman mind with a force which it cannot possess among other nations. Montesquiou very justly observes, that in the battles of modern times, the confi- dence of each individual can only be placed in the military qualities of the whole mass ; but that every Roman, being more robust and warlike than his enemy, relied on his own prowess as well as on that of his companions in arms. From this cause it proceeded that all the Romans possessed that kind of courage which naturally arises from a consciousness of * For a detailed account of the Roman discipline, arms, military engines, evolutions, encampments, and every particular relating to their system of warfare, see Vegetius De Re Militare\u2014 Polybius, lib, 6\u201417 \u2014 Academie des Inscriptions, torn. 35. p. 262, &c \u2014 Lipsius De Militia Romana \u2014 Josephus de Bello Judaico, lib. 3 \u2014 Folard's Observations on Polyb.\u2014 and Gibbou Dec. Rom.

Temporary causes may render some of them less warlike than others; but strict discipline soon brings them to an equality. The Portuguese, who were accounted the worst soldiers in Europe, became, when conducted by British officers, scarcely inferior to the troops of England and France.-]- The Italians and Poles, in the service of Napoleou, equalled the French in the day of battle, and jn all the operations of war. And if Italy were united, as in the time of the Romans, her armies might easily be rendered as formidable as those of France and Germany. The perfection of the military art has a natural tendency to increase the courage of soldiers. That army which has the greatest confidence in the effects of its own discipline, possesses a decided advantage over an enemy who is deficient in a matter so essential. If * Montesquiou Grand, et Decadence des Romains, cap. 2. + Seethe Duke of Wellington's dispatches on various occasions, and Oc reports of other British generals in the late war."], [392, "362 WAR, ETC. the individuals, of whom it is composed, have not that consciousness of personal superiority Over their oponents, by which the Romans were so eminently distinguished, they have at least a well-grounded confidence in the effective strength of the whole mass and the military skill of the Commanders. The con sciousness of their own superiority indiscipline, weapons, and tactics, encouraged small bodies of Spaniards to undertake the conquests of Mexico and Peru; and the same sentiment, united with an enthusiasm prompted by avarice, supporting them under all the hard ships and difficulties of these arduous enter prises, rendered them an overmatch for the immense population of these two empires. But amongst the numerous instances that might be adduced to illustrate this argument, none is more appropriate than the conduct of the British seamen. Conscious of their superiority and accustomed to victory, they seldom hesitate to attack an enemy whatever may be his force ; and their well-grounded confidence renders them invincible. The case was for some time the same with the French armies under Napo leon. It may seem a melancholy reflection that from the earliest periods of history, the in ventive powers of men have been employed in improving the art of murder. But if the"], [393, "WAR, ETC. 363 turbulent passions of men render wars una voidable ; it is to every nation an important concern, that its military operations should be carried on in the most effective manner that is possible. Improvements in the tactical art, far from tending to the destruction of the human species, have been in no small degree conducive to its preservation : when wars were carried on without skill, a battle was generally a downright massacre ; and undisciplined nations lavished their blood to no purpose. Herodotus in describing the battle of Platea says, that in courage and strength the Persians were not inferior to the Greeks, but they were ill armed and little skilled in discipline* The Grecian Spear, long and weighty, was greatly superior to that of the Asiatics, which was short and light ; and the firm body of the Grecian phalanx, although inferior in activity, and in the facility of its evolutions to the Roman legion, could resist the most impetuous shock of cavalry. The strong corslets, the greaves of brass, and the massy buckler of the Greeks, Were also far superior to the defensive armour of the Persians. f This inferiority in discipline, weapons, and tactics, was the princi pal cause of the bloody defeats which the * Herodot. lib. 9\u2014 cap. 61.

Persians sustained in the battles of Marathon and Platea, and a century and a half after wards at Issus and Arbela.* The improvements in the art of war have been always preceded or immediately followed by a corresponding change in the human cha racter. Since the invention of gunpowder and fire-arms, war, although become far more ex pensive, is carried on with less cruelty ; and battles are in general less bloody than they were before that event. The most sanguinary conflicts that have taken place since the French revolution, cannot, in respect of carnage, bear any comparison with those of Platea, Cann\u00e6, and numbers of others recorded jn history. The study of war as a science has tended to humanise the minds of warriors, and the improvements made in the practice appears to have had a similar effect on the character of nations and on the circumstances of the world. Amongst the most important ameliorations of the military system, is that of keeping stand ing armies, and making war a particular profession, instead of imposing it as a duty on every citizen, as was the practice of the ancients. In consequence of this happy * For the battles of Marathen and Platea, see Plutarch Vita, Mil fiad. Vita Pausan, Herodot. lib. 9.

By this regulation agriculture and trade suffer less interruption ; and the state is more effectually served than it would be by compulsory levies. \" The closeness, the regularity, and quickness of their movements, the unreserved, instaneous, and almost mechan ical obedience to orders, the sense of personal honour, and the familiarity with danger, which belong to a disciplined veteran and embodied soldiery, give such firmness and intrepidity to their approach, such weight and execution to their attack, as are not to be withstood by loose ranks of occasional and newly levied troops, who are liable, by their inexperience, to disorder and confusion, and in whom sear is constantly augmented by novelty and sur prise.\"* The judicious author of\" Moral and Politi cal Philosophy,\" while he acknowledges that a standing army is the cheapest and the most effective military force, considers it as un- * Palcy's moral and polit. philos. vol. 2, p. 472."], [396, "366 WAR, ETC. favourable to civil liberty.* But English his tory refutes this supposition. England has enjoyed a far greater degree of liberty since she maintained a standing army, than she ever possessed when her military force consisted of feudal levies. No country has ever been com pletely civilized till it maintained a standing army. The improvements of Peter the Great, and the progress of civilization in Russia, are chiefly owing to this establishment. It is the instrument which maintains all other regula tions. But if the nature of human affairs renders military establishments requisite for the pre servation of social order, war is not, for that reason, the less to be deprecated. In national contests both sides are generally losers. The prosperity and opulence of nations arise from agriculture and commerce, rather than from conquest. While the armies of Napoleon were over running and subjugating the continent, the wealth of France was exhausted, and her population dreadfully diminished. f \" War,5' * Paley's Moral and Polit.

XL CURRENT IDEAS and PUBLIC OPINION. Besides the more visible causes of which the operation seems to govern and direct the whole moral machine, there are others of a more latent and less defineable nature that have no inconsiderable influence on its movements. These may be ranged under the general head of current ideas: they arise from an endless complexity of causes, are infinitely varied in their nature, and different in their operations : some of them may be easily traced to their source: of others the origin is difficult to dis cover: some of them appeal to be founded in nature, others are often excited by policy and art ; but all of them in every age and in every country are in close connexion with the ex isting state of society, and their amalgated mass, floating in the minds of a great majority 2 A"], [400, "370 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. of individuals, forms what is called public opinion, which may either be directed by reason or led astray by error and delusion. The eternal principles of truth are the same in all ages and climates ; but opinions and prejudices are subject to unceasing variations. They take their form from the pressure of external and adventitious circumstances ; and to estimate their value we must take cool and perspicuous views, without being seduced by the colourings of fancy, the statements of misrepresentation, or those ideal phantoms which hope or fear may conjure up to mislead the judgment. The most general as well as one of the most permanent of those current ideas is patriotism, or that sentiment which attaches the mind of the individual to the country of which he is a native, to the society of which he is a member. Patriotism, however, is something very different from mere local attachment, although they are often confounded in our ideas, definitions, and estimates. Both, indeed, originate from one common source, which is habit. The child is no sooner capable of distinguishing objects, than it conceives an attachment to the persons and things that first present themselves to its notice. For its parents and familiars it im bibes a strong predilection ; and the house in which it is nursed becomes an object of its attachment. These sentiments are in the next"], [401, "371 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC; place extended to its playmates, to the streets of the village or town; and to the neighbouring fields the scene of its infantile rambles. In advancing through youth, and in the flourish ing period of manhood, social connexions are formed and multiplied. Circles of friends and familiars become united in a community of ideas and feelings, and often of interests : the sphere of human action is gradually enlarged ; and the boundaries of local attachment being thus extended, its power is commonly weak ened. The generality of men, however, retain, through life, a sort of particular affection for the place where their early years were spent. The sentiment, indeed, is natural : a man can scarcely contemplate the theatre of his child hood without agreeable reflections on the inno cent amusements of that age, so free from care and anxiety : much less can he view the places which were once the scenes of his youth, that brightest period of life, without feeling a lively interest, excited by phasing recollections. Local attachments arise from these sources: they are originally simple, and lie within narrow limits. By education and habit they are gradually extended ; and when their bound aries are marked by language, and manners, and social institutions, they assume the name of patriotism. 2 A 2"], [402, "372 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC.

This sentiment, more than even the toils of slavery, causes the wretched negro to contemplate, with pleasure, the ter mination of his mortal existence, as a happy return to his native land. In every country, whether savage or civilized, the sentiment is found to exist ; and the vulgar of every nation can scarcely think any other part of the world equal to that where they dwell.

This sentiment is generally found to be the strongest among semi-barbarous tribes. + In more polished nations its operation is less powerfully felt ; and especially among those classes whose minds are cultivated and their ideas enlarged by reading and observation. In such minds, however, it is seldom wholly extinct.

In some other countries the soil is more fertile, and a brighter sunshine gilds more genial skies : places may also be found where society presents as many charms. It is not, therefore, on any of these things that his patriotism can rest its foundation, but on a sense of obliga tion and duty to the country which has always afforded him security and protection. This noble sentiment consists in a firm attachment to the government, the constitution, and laws of his country, from the double consideration of duty and interest; and instead of being weakened, it receives additional force from his visits to foreign nations. By comparison he learns toappreciatethe political blessings which his own country enjoys, and becomes more anxious for her welfare and glory. Such was the patriotism of Greece and Rome in the most splendid periods of their history, and such are the sentiments alone which can justly be dig nified with that name. But these refined and elevated notions can scarcely be supposed to exist in any great degree amongst the multitude. In all countries the patriotism of the lower orders ia little more than a mere local attachment, which has been pathetically descril ed by Vergil, speaking in the person of Mcelib\u00e6us,"], [406, "376 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. \" Nos patri\u0153 fines et dulcia linquimus arv$ Nos patriam fugimus.\"* And Ovid, pouring forth his mournful com plaints in the place of his exile, says, \" Et pcena est patria sola carere mea.\"+ The politicians of Greece and Rome consider ing a predilection for the natal soil as the original source of patriotism, were careful to strengthen the sentiment by religion, and placed their cities under the protection of tutelar divinities. After Rome had been de stroyed by the Gauls, the people were desirous of removing to Veii, and of making that city their capital, but were diverted from their purpose by a speech of Camiljus. \" Here, in this place,\" says that magistrate and military commander, \" have been preserved the sacred fires of Vesta : here the shields sent down from heaven have been deposited : while you re main in this place you are certain of the pro tection of the gods. \"J The Roman statesmen used everv means to convert the natural but J! passive sentiment of local attachment into an artificial but active principle of patriotism.

The sentiment of patriotism has always been the strongest in small and semi-civilized states. Among the Greeks, individuals seem to have been almost exclusively consider d in their relations to the public. A noble air of patriotism runs through all their moral writings, and the ethics of Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and other Grecian philosophers, are little else than treatises concerning political duties. The \" Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\"* was the prevailing maxim, and such was the force of its operation, that with the Athenians, the Laced\u00e6monians, and the Ro mans, during the c.rlv ages of their republics, life did not appear to be the property ol indivi duals, but of the state ; and they sacrificed it with the greatest alacrity for the interests and the glory of their country. The Romans, during the first ages of their republic, were placed in a situation similar to * \" It ic delightful and glorious to die for one's country.\""], [408, "378 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. that of the Grecian communities. Their terri tories were small, their domestic life displayed no luxury, and scarcely any elegance : every citizen was a soldier, and had, by office or suffrage, a share in the management of public affairs. The consequence of such a state of society was, that the love of his country was the predominant passion of each individual, the greatness of the Roman name, the object of his pride and enthusiasm : self-preservation, self-interest, all the cares and pleasures of private life, were considered as trifles beneath attention. But this spirit of stern patriotism began to evaporate when diffused through an immense population, like a river diverted into numerous channels, while the introduction of luxury excited a taste for domestic pleasures. The citizenship of Rome being given to all the inhabitants of Italy, and afterwards to all the people of the empire, no longer conferred any distinction; and thus the nation of legislators and warriors was dissolved into the common mass, and confounded with the crowds of ser vile provincials who had received the name without adopting the spirit of Romans.* The case is somewhat similar in all extensive em pires, where the importance of each individual is diminished in proportion to the magnitude of the political mass. Under the Asiatic des- * Gibbon Dec. Rom.

But even under the milder monarchies of Europe, the majority of the subjects live at so great a distance from the seat of empire, and have so little share in public transactions, that they pay more attention to their private con cerns of business or pleasure, than to the affairs of the state. Modern patriotism, therefore, is a sentiment of a much looser texture and less powerful operation than that of the Greeks and Romans, which glowed with so much ardour during the primitive ages of their re publics, and excited ihem to exhibit those prodigies of valour and fortitude which com mand the admiral ion of all succeeding ages. The patriotism of the ancients was mixed with a strong degree of enthusiasm, which rendered it capable of producing effects so astonishing. These two sentiments, indeed, are the most powerful of all current ideas, and in every nation, where they exist in any conspicuous degree, their influence on the public mind and character is not to be easily estimated. Enthusiasm is an ardour of mind, the influ ence of which on the actions of men is almost incredible, and its effects, until ascertained by experience, are always incalculable. It is an"], [410, "380 CURRENT IDEAS, E1C. engine of such prodigious powers that by it the whole moral world may be moved. Such an instrument must, in unskilful or mis- chievous hands, be exceedingly dangerous ; but when dexterously managed and judiciously applied, it is capable of producing not only the most extraordinary but the most beneficial effects. Without its co-operation the patrio- tism of Greece and Rome would only have been a vague sentiment, an inert principle, unpro- ductive of any thing great or illustrious. En- thusiasm, however, has often led men into such dreadful extravagances, that its name is gene- rally mentioned with contempt or with horror ;* but it must be considered that with- out some degree of this impulse, the hero would not expose his life in battle, nor the sage consume his days in study. Without en thusiasm, letters, sciences, and arts would languish, and nothing that is great could be produced in human affairs. To some individuals enthusiasm is given by nature : in large bodies of men, such as nations or armies, it is. always excited by policy and * Enthusiasm simply means an extraordinary warmth of imagination, or ardour of mind in some particular pursuit, and consequently the word may be taken either in a good or bad sense : in the former sense it is generally acknowledged, that unless the poet, the painter, &c. be an enthusiast ill his art he cannot excel. But the bad effects of enthusi asm have often been so terribly conspicuous, that the wo,rd jj commonly taken in the worse sense."], [411, "381 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. art, or by a particular train of circumstances ; and its duration is generally transient. Among the Romans a patriotic and military enthusi asm continued longer than in any other nation. It was constantly excited and supported by the civil and religious institutions, as well as by the circumstances of the republic, which, amidst continual wars and repeated triumphs, was almost alw ays in a state of progressive but for a long time of slow aggrandisement. In this state of continual warfare, the military enthusiasm of the Romans had scarcely any time to cool ; and it accordingly remained for several centuries in its full vigour. The instances of the astonishing effects of enthusiam, on national character as well as on national circumstances, are numerous and well authenticated. The Arabians, in the first ages of the Caliphate, exhibited one of the most remarkable proofs of its force that can be found in history. At the time of Mahomed's appearance they were divided into a number of small tribes, without military skill or political power. But when the prophet promulgated a new system of religion to the rude and unen lightened Arabians, the propagation of the faith being made one of the conditions of ob taining eternal salvation, was a stimulus too strong to be resisted by an ignorant people ; and the enthusiasm excited by prospects so"], [412, "382 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC; novel and brilliant, propelled them with ail irresistible force beyond the limits of their native deserts. In the eye of an impartial observer, the con quests of the Arabians appear far more astonishing than those of the Romans. During the victorious ages of the republic, the Romans almost invariably confined their counsels and arms to a single war, and made it their con stant aim to suppress completely one enemy before they provoked the hostility of another. But the enthusiasm of the Arabians disdained these cautious maxims of policy. With the same vigour and success they invaded the empires of Persia and Constantinople, the former of which they totally subdued, the latter they despoiled of several of its finest provinces, and reduced it to little more than half of its former extent. Under the reign of Omar, the second of the Caliphs, which con tinued only ten years, they reduced to his obedience thirty-six thousand cities and castles, and erected one thousand four hundred mos- ques. Within eighty-two years after the death of Mahomed, his successors had extended their dominions from the river Indus to the Atlantic ocean, and established an empire little inferior to that which the Romans had acquired in seven centuries. All this was them effect of enthusiasm, founded on religion. Gibbon ob-"], [413, "383 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. serves, that the Arabians were invincible in fact because they were invincible in opinion.* And it is certain that their first leaders and their troops displayed a desperate valour, of which the most brilliant periods of Greek and Roman glory, afford few examples. But when their enthusiasm began to subside, their im mense empire, being first split into parts, became a prey to foreign invaders ; and the Arabian nation sunk into its former state of insignificance and obscurity. In human affairs great weights, as Lord Bacon observes, often hang upon small wires. The greatest events are sometimes the effects of causes apparently trivial ; enthusiasm has its source in the natural activity of the human mind: it is a spark which is never totally ex tinguished ; and history shews that the breath of priests or of politicians can easily blow it into a flame. The cruisades exhibit the most curious picture of enthusiasm that is found in the annals of mankind. They were the most interesting transactions of the middle ages, and their effects were as important as the expe ditions themselves were romantic. Their history has been written by Maimbourg, Mi chaud, and others . it has been sketched in a masterly manner by Gibbon, and it forms a * Gibbon Dec. Roro.

Like all other narratives of military transactions, it presents to the view horrid scenes of destruction and carnage ; but the causes from which these ex travagant enterprises originated, and the effects which they produced, display curious and interesting features in the character of human intellect, and the progress of European society. From the time of the apostles, christians had been accustomed to visit the places that were consecrated to pious veneration by the pre sence, the preaching, and the sufferings of the redeemer. After Jerusalem and all Judea were wrested from the eastern empire by the successors of Mahomed, the practice still continued, and was permitted and even en couraged by the liberal policy of the Arabian Caliphs. But when the Caliphate, long rent by intestine divisions, sunk under the pressure of foreign hostility, and the Turks, a ferocious and uncivilized race, became masters of Pales tine, the christian pilgrims were exposed to every kind of extortion and insult. This had been long a subject of complaint, and had ex cited the resentment of the nations of Christen dom. The project of recovering Jerusalem by arms had been formed by popes and princes; but various circumstances retarded its execution;"], [415, "CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. 385 arid, perhaps, it might have vanished like many of the airy plans of romantic enterprise, had not the enthusiastic ardour of Peter the hermit roused, in a favourable moment, the zeal and ambition of Europe. The pilgrimages which have excited the wonder and ridicule of the modern world, although converted, in process of time, to pur poses of superstition, originated from associa tions of ideas, noble in themselves, and na tural to the human mind, which is always delighted and often inspired with laudable sentiments in contemplating the places which have once been the theatre of heroic actions or important events.* It appears, indeed, to have been an universal propensity of mankind, in all ages, to venerate the places where philoso phers, heroes, and other celebrated personages have been born or have resided, and the sepulchres in which their bones are deposited. Cicero felt all the force of these associations betwpen local objects and distant events, which call forth the latent powers of feeling and intellect. \"I know not,'' says he, \" from. what principle our emotions arise, in those places where are found the traces of those whom we love or admire. For my part, our * Sages and heroes who have visited the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the inspiration of the genius of the place. Gibbon Dec. Rom.

Examples, incalculable in number, and most respectable in regard to authority, might be adduced, to shew that the influence of such associations have been felt by all men of genius and taste. Their effects are remarked by a modern traveller on passing the Granicus, a river celebrated in history. -j- \" What then,\" says he, \" is this spell of glory ?

A judicious and elegant writer describes, in a concise and lively manner, the origiu and effects of the associations which rise in the mind on surveying an antique land, re-echoing the voice of ages and the records of history. Alluding to the emotions which the view of the relics of Rome excite in the mind of the spectator, he says, \"It is ancient Rome that fills his imagination.

Take from him these associations, \u2014 conceal from him that it is Rome which he sees ; and how different would be his emotions.\"* And a classical traveller observes that, \" Were Rome, with all its magnificent edifices and noble remains annihilated, the seven hills would still be dear to genius and virtue. The pilgrim would still come from distant regions to visit, with reverence, the spot on which once stood the first of cities.''f No traveller, who approaches Avignon, neglects to visit Vaucluse, which derives its celebrity from the poetical genius of Petrarch, and every lover of letters, views with enthu siasm, the house where he lived, and his tomb in the village of Arquata, near Padua. Man tua is still revered as the native country of Virgil ; and the tomb of that celebrated poet at Pausilippo, near Naples, is still an object of high veneration to the literati of every nation. Men of genius yet resort with eager curiosity to Athens, and experience the same emotions as those felt by Cicero, in contem plating the places once honoured by the pre sence and instructions of men, whose names are an ornament to the pages of history. Here, * Mlison on Taste, vol. 1 . p. 42. t Eustace's Classical Tour, vol. 2. p. 160,"], [419, "current ideas, etc. 389 .says to himself the enraptured admirer of venerable antiquity, the virtuous Socrates, here the divine Plato, here Aristotle, instructed the Athenians ; and here Themistocles, Mil tiades, Aristides, Conon, Pericles, Demos thenes, and other illustrious commanders and orators, by their eloquent harangues, roused them to acts of valour and patriotism. Under emotions excited by these circumstances of striking coincidence, a single moment seems to concentrate whole ages of human existence. How many persons of genius and taste, im pelled by an ardent curiosity and literary enthusiasm, still visit the Troade, traverse it in every direction, and examine every rivulet and hillock, in order to fix the scenes described by Homer, and particularly the site of 1 Ilium, although the lapse of near thirty centuries has obliterated every trace of that famous city. What enthusiastic delight do they not feel when they fancy that they have discovered the tombs of Ajax and Achilles on the Sig\u0153an and Riph\u0153an promontories ? With what minute accuracy do they not explore the heights of Bonarbashy, and the sources of the Simois and the Scamander ? But if any thing connected with the history of past ages be calculated to awaken local enthusiasm, Jeru salem and its environs, are entitled to pre eminent consideration. If it be esteemed"], [420, "390 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC. rational and sentimental to explore, with rapturous veneration, the scenes of the Iliad, can it be absurd to visit, with pious reverence, the places celebrated in scriptural history. If the man of letters seels an exquisite animation in viewing the tombs, real or supposed, of the heroes of Greece or Troy, must not a christian, must not a philosopher experience devout emotions on contemplating the place where the mortal part of the Saviour of mankind was once deposited. In viewing the site of Ilium, or the remains of Athens and Rome, we con template a vast funeral procession which con veys individuals, kingdoms, and empires to the tomb. Jerusalem presents to our recollec tion a different scene, \u2014 a scene unique in the worid. It exhibits a memorial of the junction of heaven with earth, of that great event which fixes the magnificent destiny of man : \u2014 which, instead of exciting lugubrious reflections on the shortness of life, and the instability of human power and splendour, inspires the mind with views beyond the grave, with hopes that extend into eternity. .

Popular superstition, seconded by priestly imposture or ignorance, established the fatal delusion which was confirmed by the zeal or the policy of popes and princes. Thus an intellectual impulse, natural to the mind of man, and a sentiment of devotion congenial to the christian character, were changed into a religious and afterwards a military enthusiasm, which convulsed, during the spaceof almost two centuries, both Europe and Asia.* \u25a0' Amidst the universal deliriim,\" says a modern writer, *' not a single sage was heard to utter the voice of reason : no one was astonished at what causes our surprise.

Every age of the world, from she remotest antiquity to the most recent period, affords instances of the power of enthusiasm, when operating on nations or numerous bodies of men.

But after the establish ment of the imperial government in the person of Napoleon, the illusion began to vanish. The liberty for which the French had been making so tremendous efforts, was discovered to be only a phantom ; and the enthusiasm which it had excited, began to evaporate. Military discipline and tactical skill, the re sult of that martial system which had been established, insured, for a long time, success to their arms ; and repeated victories not only kept up the spirits of the soldiers, but con tinued to dazzle the eyes of the nation. The liberty of the people was then forgotten in the greatness and glory of the empire. Illusion thus succeeded illusion ; but the enthusiasm of the French people had greatly abated, by the frustation of those hopes by which it had been so tremendously excited. When the temerity of their emperor and the chances of war had turned the scale of success, and victory was no longer attached to his standards, the change which had taken place in public opinion, was immediately perceptible. When the allies had crossed the Rhine, they sound nothing of that determined resistance which they had so fatally experienced in the com mencement of the revolutionary war.

The ardour of the French at the commence ment of the revolutionary war, when contrasted with their apathy in the last campaign of Napoleon, constitutes a striking feature in the history of national enthusiasm, exhibiting a proof of the facility with which it may be excited, the difficulty of keeping it in its full vigour, and the wonderful effects which it is capable of producing on the national mind and character. Enthusiasm has the greatest influence on minds which are but partially enlightened.

In the battle of the following day, the Russians bravely withstood the whole force of the French emperor, directed by his consum mate skill ; and the ensanguined scene drew from him this exclamation, \" Jamais on n' a vu un pareil champ de battaille.\"* But the * \" Never has one seen such a field of battle,\" \u25a0"], [428, "398 CURRENT IDEAS, ETC sacrifices to which the Russians submitted, were such as few other nations would have made. Had they been in a higher state of civilization, they would have felt greater re luctance to give up their capital to the flames, for the sake of embarrassing the invaders of their country. To direct public opinion, and render current ideas subservient to the views of the state and the good of society, has always been a principal object with legislators and rulers. The design is judicious, for mind is the invisible agent that governs the world. But as the great bulk of mankind receive stronger impressions from what strikes the senses, than from any thing that should operate on the understanding, a variety of outward forms have been wisely de vised, in order to produce the requisite effects on the mind. The splendour of government, the pomp of religious ceremonies, the glitter of military parade, and the sound of martial music are not things of mere ostentation for the gratification of vanity : they have their source in sound philosophy, in a knowledge of human nature, and are calculated to strike those finer chords of the imagination which give an im pulse to thought and action.

With the power of this political magic the Romans were well acquainted. Long before luxury was known in their private life, they introduced solemn processions, rich habits, and pompom ceremonies into all the branches of public administration, whether civil, religious, or military. Of the utility of outward forms, both in religion. and politics, all mankind seem to be fully sensible. External worship, when attended with pomp and magnificence, elevates the mind, and attaches it to religion.* The vast fabric of the temple, its majestic height and venerable antiquity, the deep gioom and solemn silence, or the blaz,e of light reflected from numerous lamps, and the awful bursts of the organ, make a powerful impression on the soul.

After Christianity was established in the empire, the labarum or cross, inclosing the sacred monogram of the name of Christ, was adopted as the military standard by Constan tine and his successors, with a view of inspiring the soldiers with courage through the influence of religion. The Danish raven, an appropriate symbol of the gloomy and ferocious disposi tion of the Scandinavian warriors, was chosen by them for their standard, as the eagles had been by the Romans, and was held in nearly the same veneration. All the nations of modern Europe have their military standards conse crated by the ceremonies^ of religion. All governments deem it expedient to animate the spirits of their soldiers and subjects by military spectacles. It would scarcely have been pos sible to behold the pompous magnificence of a Roman triumph without feeling a glow of martial enthusiasm. All these things it may be said are illusions. But it is such illusions that have produced most of the great and astonishing effects which have given a striking brilliancy to the annals of the world. All human life is a scenic representation.

It is difficult, in some cases, to dispel the clouds that hang over the principles of politics and legislation, which have so great influence on human affairs. \" As soon as a victorious system is proclaimed, it rules opinion, tyrannizes over thought : its impres sion is every where to be found.\"* Accidental circumstances, or the train of passing events rather than correct views, often give a turn to subjects of investigation, and operate a change in national character. This was, perhaps, more generally the case before the diffusion of learning into the great mass of the people : but even at the present time the same causes exist, although their agency be dilferently managed. Among the ancients, besides the powers of eloquence, oracles, auguries, and other impostures were employed to sway public opinion, and excite public sentiment.

Of this, the conduct of Napoleon, who, amidst all his vast projects of conquest, never commenced a war without professing an ardent desire of peace, exhibits a notorious and recent example. Such asser tions are, in every country, readily believed by the great mass of the people, who are often deceived by false professions of disinterested ness and patriotism, while behind the scene the political actors laugh at the characters which they play on the stage. By accurate observation and an attentive perusal of history, we become acquainted with the whole farce and fallacy of life. Men of enlightened minds can alone pierce the veil that conceals the mysterious complexity of human affairs, and the folly of vulgar ideas and opinions: the people, involved in ignor ance, are only a passive machine, possessing, indeed, prodigious powers, but requiring a dexterous management.

Ignorance aids illusion, and lends to ideas and objects an air of enchantment. An emi nent writer observes, that \" The correction of One single prejudice has often been attended by consequences more important and exten sive, than could be produced by any positive stock of information.\"* But it is also certain, that the establishment of prejudices is often productive of as great effects as could arise from their correction or even their eradication ; and that the actions and events which give the most interest to history, as well as to poetry, frequently result from false systems and erro neous ideas in religion, politics, morals, and science. \"j\" Among the politicians of ancient Rome it was invariably held as a maxim, that the people ought to be kept in ignorance of many things that were true, and be made to believe many things that were false.

Dr. Smith remarks this effect in speaking of the decisions and councils of Calcutta and Madras on several critical oc casions. \" The members,\" says he, \" of these councils had been bred to professions very dif ferent from war and politics.

Most of the politicians, and many of the generals of France, at that period, arose from the different departments of the law, or of commerce, or from the inferior class of ecclesiastics, \u2014 men who had, neither by educa tion, nor habit, been trained to the part which they were called to act.* Many victims of the revolution exhibired instances not only of loyalty and of filial and parental affection, but also of fortitude and pious resignation, of which they had scarcely thought themselves capable.

Oliver Cromwell does not seem to have been tinctured in private life with any of that hyprocrisy which marked his character after his appearance on the public theatre. Several of the principal actors in the French revolution, men whose names are now remembered with horror, had not before that unhappy period shewed any ferocity of dis- position. The history of human affairs shews that characters are formed by circumstances. The man who would shudder at the thought of shedding the blood of an enemy, can, when placed at the head of an army, survey the field strewed with dead without any painful emo- tions. And he who in private life had always been mild, unassuming, and devoid of am- bition, often becomes severe, haughty, and as piring in the conduct of public affairs, the state of the times, and the exigencies of his situation, imposing upon him this dire neces sity. The character of natjons, like that of in dividuals, changes with their circumstances. The moral like the physical world presents a perpetual revolution. It is never in a state of"], [441, "POLITICAL EVENTS. 411 repose, and many of the changes by which it is agitated spring from causes more trivial than some would imagine. \" In morals, as well as in physics,\" says Helvetius, \"we are struck by the great alone : we constantly assign great causes to great effects : we would make the signs in the Zodiac announce the fall or revo lutions of empires.

The history of man, of nations, of their social circumstances in past and present times, and of the events by which these circumstances have been determined, is the source of all moral knowledge.

The Romans having acquired a knowledge of the arts and sciences from Greece, disseminated them with their conquests. After seven centuries of suc cessful wars, Rome accomplished the subjuga tion of the then known world. The people of western Asia, enervated by luxury and oppressed by despotism, made only a feeble resistance to her arms ; but the transalpine nations of Europe, brave, independent, and uncorrupted by opulence, defended their pos sessions with an obstinate valour. During the long and fierce struggle for dominion, many countries of Europe were desolated and almost depopulated ; but it was the distin tinguishing characteristic of the Romans, to civilize wherever they conquered. As a com pensation for the loss of a barbarous indepen dence, they communicated their arts and sciences, their language and manners, to their new subjects. Colonies of Romans were placed amongst the native inhabitants. New cities were built, agriculture was encouraged, a re gular government was established, and the public tranquillity was maintained. All the countries to the south of the Danube, and to the west of the Rhine, assumed a new aspect ; and in language, manners, and habits of life, the native inhabitants became Romans. Civi- lization was thus spread over all these exten-"], [444, "414 POLITICAL EVENTS. sive regions : the Romans having embraced Christianity, propagated their religion together with their arts ; and the human mind received a general illumination, which, although greatly obscured by the dreadful convulsions that accompanied the fall of the empire, could never be wholly extinguished. This state of prosperity and extensive civi lization continued with little interruption during the space of four centuries.* But in the midst of this calm, causes, hostile to its permanence, were silently operating. The vanquished nations had been disarmed by their conquerors ; and as Rome had a vast extent of frontier, no less than the whole length of the Rhine and the Danube to defend against the unsubdued nations of northern Europe, she was almost continually engaged in wars; and the provinces were drained of their martial youth to recruit her legions. The independent spirit of their ancestors be came extinct among all the people subjected to the Roman yoke ; and those warlike nations who had at a former period so long and so obstinately withstood the veteran legions of Rome, commanded by her ablest generals, made only a feeble resistance to the arms of * This period may very properly be considered as commencing with the christian era, when the temple of Janus was shut by Augustus as a signal of universal peace, and ending at the accession of Honorius."], [445, "POLITICAL EVENTS. 415 the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Lombards, and other tribes of barbarians. The oppressive extortions and mismanagement of the imperial administration, the rapacity of its delegates, and the enormous weight of the taxes, excited a general disaffection to the Roman govern- ment, and rendered its subjects indifferent spectators of its fall.* Wherever the invaders met with any check to their victorious and devastating career, it was from the Roman legions : none of the historians of the times mention any vigorous resistance made by the inhabitants of the provinces, nor any effectual attempt to organize an army for that pur.pose.-j\" Thus, without the operation or concurrence of any physical cause, the misconduct of the Roman government, under the emperors, had produced in its subjects a moral degradation, and changed the formerly courageous inhabi- tants of Gaul, Spain, lllyrium, &c. into a herd of unresisting victims.

During this period of dreadful contest, the condition of the northern nations was in every respect quite different from that of the Romans. Among them the martial spirit was in its full vigour. Their leaders were hardy and enter prising, and strangers to that luxury which had enervated the courtiers and military com manders of Rome ; and the numerous armies which they brought into the field were sup ported by pillage. In their own country they had no cities, and often no fixed habitations. And preferring the genial climate and cultiva ted regions of the south, to their own gloomy forests and vast deserts, numerous bodies of armed men, with their wives and children, issued forth in search of new settlements. Those who first fixed their residence in the countries which they had conquered, were ex pelled or exterminated by new invaders.

The subversion of the Roman empire pro- duced the most disastrous change that had ever taken place in this quarter of the globe. During a long succession of ages the civiliza- tion of Europe, although advancing by steps exceedingly slow, had constantly been progres- sive, beginning in Greece, and gradually ex- tending itself first into Italy, and afterwards into Spain, Gaul, and Britain. But at this unhappy period, the regular structure of Roman government was annihilated ; and a foundation was laid for that fertile source of anarchy, the feudal system, which held the people of every nation in a state of slavery. The Roman jurisprudence, the noblest monu- ment of the wisdom of a people that for seve- ral centuries had ruled the civilized world, was set aside and almost forgotten. And even the christian religion, which some of the northern nations had embraced before, and others soon after thev had subverted the empire, was corrupted by a mixture of degra- ding superstitions. The scenes of devastation and slaughter, of oppression and anarchy, which accompanied and followed the settlement of the barbarians in their new conquests, were decidedly hostile to the cultivation of intellect. Literary pur suits are the amusements of leisure and pros perity, when the mind, free from external pres- 2 a"], [448, "418 POLITICAL EVENTS. sure and distraction, can expatiate at ease over the regions of fancy and invention, and cull their flowers without fear or interruption. But in the fall of empires, when misery besets every door, and death stares every man in the face, it is natural to turn to objects of greater and more pressing importance. Without the pro tection of regular government, and the cer tainty of personal security, men will never make any progress in sciences, arts, or letters, nor think of attaining refinement in taste or in manners. Within less than a century, almost all the knowledge and civilization which the Romans had diffused throughout the western empire disappeared ; and the human mind, neglected and depressed, sunk into the most deplorable ignoranee. \" Europe,\" says a celebrated historian, \"did not produce during four centuries one author who merits to be read, either on account of the elegance of his composition, or the justness and novelty of his sentiments. There is hardly one inven tion, useful or ornamental to society, of which that long period can boast .\"* A more strik ing picture of the profound ignorance that pre vailed throughout Europe after the subversion of the Roman empire, can scarcely be delineated by the pen of the historian. * Dr. Robertson Hist.

The conquests of the Arabians have already been mentioned. They were a more polished and less sanguinary people than the northern barbarians, and the progress of their arms was far less destructive ; but like them they were enemies to learning, and their fanaticism inspired them with contempt for intellectual attainments. From the Indus to the Atlantic ocean, the arms and religion of the Moslems carried fanaticism and ignorance in their train. Both the east and the west were, at the same period, ingulphed in barba rism. And Constantinople was the insulated seat of literature and arts. In Europe, the barbaric inundation swept away almost every remnant of science and civilization. But Dr. Robertson seems to have assigned too great a length of lime to the period of total obscurity. It is well known that in the age of Charlemagne there flourished some men of considerable erudition ; and every oue is acquainted with the efforts of that monarch to rescue letters from the general gloom in which they were involved. These attempts, although seconded by the abilities of several learned men, were indeed like meteors that appear in the night : they cast a momentary 2 D 2"], [450, "420 POLITICAL EVENTS. light ; but the darkness returned. The general ignorance was too deeply rooted to be removed by the transient efforts of one single reign. But it is certain that the institutions of Charle magne contributed, in no small degree, to the restoration of letters in Europe. And although the eclipse of learning continued almost a thousand years, yet the seventh and eighth centuries constitute the period of its greatest obscuration. While Charlemagne was attempting to pro cure the revival of letters in Europe, the Ara bian Caliph Haroun Al Raschid was labouring for the same purpose in Asia, and with greater success. The northern barbarians of Europe consisted of different nations and tribes, who, after they had settled in the Roman provinces, were in a continual state of hostilities. The conquests of the Caliphs were made by one single people, and during a considerable period their extensive empire was united under one head. The different circumstances of the Arabians and of the nations of Europe will therefore account for the different progress which they made in the sciences. As soon as the Arabians turned their attention to the cultivation of intellect, and their Caliphs gave encouragement to learning, they made very rapid advances ; and the arts of civilization shed a brilliancy over their empire, while"], [451, "POLITICAL EVENTS. 421 Europe was overshaded by a dense cloud of ignorance. The feudal system which was established in Europe, being equally hostile to regal autho- rity and popular liberty, was calculated to keep up a state of anarchy, slavery, and igno- rance. The origin of this system is a subject of which the investigation has exercised the pens of many able writers. Montesquiou thinks that its traces may be discovered in the honorary rewards bestowed by the chiefs of ancient Germany on their retainers.* The Abbe Mably is of a different opinion. f Any attempt to decide a question so difficult and obscure would require an accumulation of historical and antiquarian research, which, in this place, would afford but little entertain- ment or instruction. It may not, indeed, be amiss to observe, that the universal adoption of the feudal system, by all the northern nations after their establishment in their new posses- sions, if it does not afford a positive proof, at least authorises a strong presumption that the rudiments of it had existed among them in their original seats, and that it was not a new in vention, although it undoubtedly received various modifications from the novelty of their circumstances. * Montesq.

It may naturally be supposed that on the first appropriation of land, the proprietors were numerous ; and the estates of individuals proportionably small.

There is a certain stage in the progress of society in which the power of the chieftains or lords must naturally receive a gradual aug mentation, while the authority of sovereigns and the liberty of the people suffer a propor abie diminution. In this semi-barbarous state the northern nations remained during seve ral centuries after their establishment in the Roman provinces.* In countries which have neither foreign commerce, nor any of the finer manufactures, a great proprietor having no thing for which he can exchange that part of the produce of his lands which remains above the maintenance of the cultivators, consumes it in rustic hospitality. He is therefore at all times surrounded by a crowd of retainers and dependants, who having no equivalent to give for their maintenance, and being fed by his bounty, must obey him for the same reason that soldiers must obey the prince by whom they are paid.f The territorial jurisdiction possessed by the nobles, during the middle ages, did not originate from the feudal laws, * For the general state of slavery in France in the tenth century, see Montesquiou Esprit des Loix, liv. 30.

One of their first measures was that of granting immunities to cities and corporate bodies, which, being in consequence attached to the sovereign, and gradually increasing in opulence and strength, became a barrier be tween the nobles and the crown : another was to restore social order by abolishing private wars ; and in this they were powerfully seconded by the authority of the church, which justly declared those deadly feuds to be diametrically opposite to the spirit of Christianity. It was equally necessary to deprive the great barons of their juridical powers, which were so inju rious to the royal authority, and to extirpate a number of other abuses that were the bane of European society. But the attainment of these objects would have been next to impossible had not events occurred which proved highly favourable to the efforts of the princes of Europe.* The crnisades, which, considered in one point of view, appear lo be the most romantic expedi tions recorded in the annals of the world; and the history of which, is regarded in modern times, as a singular memorial of human fanati cism and folly, greatly contributed to enfeeble and eventually to abolish the exorbitant * For a short but lively dissertation on the decline of the feudal system, vide Segur's Hist.

The influence of the cruisades on the com- merce and opulence of Europe, were not less important than their effects on its political system. The first rendezvouses the cruisaders was commonly in Italy or Sicily. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and other cities, which furnished them with transports, and supplied them with military stores and provisions, were enriched by that lucrative trade, and obtained great immunities and privileges in the settlements made by the christians in Asia.* The con- quest of Constantinople by the Latins, threw all the trade of the Eastern empire into the hands of the Italians, especially those of Venice and Genoa.

Some of these cities, taking advantage of the necessities of the emperors, purchased, or, by successful re volt, extorted from them such immunities as left them little more than a nominal sove reignty.* The institution of these municipal ities soon made its way into France, !Spain, Flanders, Germany, and England, with this material difference, that in these countries they were established by the sovereigns in order to diminish the power of the barons ; but in Italy the inhabitants having purchased, or extorted their privileges, formed their cities into distinct and independent republics ; and although for a considerable time, they acknowledged the paramount sovereignty of the emperors, it ap pears that before the close of the thirteenth century, most of them had entirely shaken off every mark of subjection to the imperial au thority, The cruisades had also a very importaut effect in extending the sphere of geographical and political knowledge.

Christendom as their common country. The novelty of these circumstances could not fail of extending their ideas, and refining their manners. In their journey towards Palestine, the cruisaders passed through countries more civilized than their own \u2014 countries in which the arts both of convenience and elegance flourished in a degree far beyond any thing that they had hitherto seen. In opulence and splendour the Italian cities were greatly su- perior to those of England, France, and Ger- many. Constantinople, which had never yet felt the destructive rage of barbarians, far sur- passed the other cities of Europe in extent, population, commerce, wealth, and magnifi- cence. That capital of the east was the great mart for the rich commodities of India, and the only city of Europe that retained any image of the ancient arts, or any tincture of Grecian literature. The cruisaders could not march through those countries, and behold their institutions, their civilization and opu lence, without finding their prejudices weaken ed, their views enlarged, and their minds en lightened by the accession of new ideas ; and the illumination was rendered more general by by the close intercourse which subsisted be tween the east and the west, during almost two centuries.

To these romantic expeditions, therefore, we owe the first per manent gleam of light that burst through the gloom in which Europe was involved. The spirit of chivalry had also a considerable influence in polishing the manners of Europe. This singular institution, in which valour, gallantry, and religion, were so strangely blended, appears to have derived its origin from the cruisades, and it partook of their ro mantic cast.* It arose out of the state of society, which, in those ages, exhibited a scene of continual war, rapine, and anarchy. The weak and unarmed were every moment exposed to insults and injuries, which the power of the sovereign was too limited to prevent, and the administration of justice too feeble to redress. There was scarcely any protection against violence and oppression, but what the vaiour and generosity of private persons afforded. When the final reduction of the holy land under the dominion of infidels, put an end to these foreign expeditions which had drained Europe of so much noble blood, chivalry was the only employ that was left for the activity \u2022 Chivalry was instituted in the twelfth century."], [462, "432 POLITICAL EVENTS. and courage of martial adventurers. To check the insolence of oppressors, to succour the dis tressed, to avenge or protect women, orphans, or ecclesiastics, who could not bear arms in their own defence, were acts of the greatest prowess and merit. Valour, humanity, courtesy, justice, and honour, were the characteristics of chivalry. Young men of noble birth were trained to knighthood by previous discipline, and initiated into the order by religious cere monies, the most sacred and solemn. It was esteemed the highest distinction, and consider ed by monarchs, as giving an additional lustre to their crowns. The sentiments which chi valry inspired, had a wonderful influence on Europe during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and were so deeply rooted as to operate after the vigour of the institution declined. Humanity in war, refinement in gallantry, and many other circumstances which distinguish modern from ancient manners, may be, in a great measure, ascribed to the now obsolete institution of chivalry. During the long period of time which has here been brought under consideration in the most concentrated form, many other remark able events concurred to promote the progress of knowledge, commerce, and civilization.

The improvements which now began to take place in juridical proceed ings, produced a change in the social system of great importance and extensive effect. They obliged men to cultivate different talents and to acquire different accomplishments, in order to qualify themselves for the various functions which became necessary in society. Another profession besides that of arms was introduced amongst the laity. The affairs of civil life became objects of attention ; and the cultiva tion of the arts of peace began to be regarded as honourable. The culture and manufacture of silk, introduced into Sicily by Roger I. opened a new field to commerce and industry.

During several centuries, the depression of the nobles, and the exaltation of the people, had been the great object of the monarchs of Europe.

In some cases, they arose from a spirit of adventure, and a desire of obtaining better settlements and more ample possessions : at other times, from expulsion by a conquering people or a victorious party ; and often, perhaps, from the banishment of criminals. To the last of these causes, a modern writer thinks that the origin of the savage state is chiefly to be ascribed. \" Various criminals,\" says he, \" followed by their families, must have been, from time to time, driven to countries far distant from the parent state.

These being but little acquainted with the arts of civilized life, and still less with the nature of government, would easily sink into a savage state, in which they would continue till some individuals of superior abilities would reduce the rest under their dominion, and thus form them into barbarian kingdoms and communities, as they are sound at present to exist.

The history of Asia is more luminous as well as of greater importance ; and it exhibits a series of events very different from those which mark the annals of Europe. While this quarter of the globe, excepting that part of Spain which was under the dominion of the Arabians, was in volved in profound ignorance, learning was assiduously cultivated in Asia; and Bagdad, the capital of the Caliphate, was the seat of the sciences. But while Europe was emerging from the gloom, by which it had long been pbscured, events of a most disastrous nature took place in Asia.

The causes which decide the fate of nations and dynasties are often apparently trifling. Sometimes they are of a momentary nature, although their effects endure for ages : a wrong measure in politics, an error in the plan of a battle, or of a cam- paign, has ruined great princes, and overturned mighty empires. Had Darius acted in the same manner as the monarch who sat on his throne near seven hundred years afterwards, the Macedonians would not have become masters of his extensive dominions ; and Alex- ander would had no better success in his in- vasion of Persia than the Emperor Julian met with in following the same route, or than Napoleon recently experienced in penetrating to Moscow. Sometimes one single man gives an impulse to millions, and causes revolutions in empires ; but to produce such effects great abilities are insufficient, without other coinci- dences.

COMPARISON OF THE ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. In concluding these investigations of national character, it may not be amiss to cast a glance of comparison on the ancient and modern world. On this subject, indeed, as on many others, opinions are divided, and, probably, will never be reconciled. By the denomina tion of ancients the Greeks and the Romans are generally designated, these being the only nations of antiquity which we consider as chiefly worthy of our attention and inquiries. The comparison between these and the moderns has seldom been fairly made, as there are few subjects on which the mind of a literary man is more liable to be biassed by the prejudices of early education. The classical authors of Greece and Rome were our companions in"], [475, "445 COMPARISON, ETC. early youth : from their writings were formed most of our ideas of all that is great and sub lime: it is, therefore, no wonder that the feel ings of the man are influenced by the warm imaginations of the schoolboy. \" The name of Rome,\" says a modern writer, \" echoes in our ears from our infancy: our lisping tongues are tuned to her language; and our first and most delightful years are passed among her orators, poets, and historians. We are taught betimes to take a deep interest in her fortunes, and to adopt her cause as that, of our own country, with spirit and passion. Such impressions, made at such an age, are indelible, and, it must be admitted, are likely to influence our feel ings and opinions during life.\"* That this is the case, perhaps, no one will seriously deny ; and this early prepossession naturally nourishes in our minds an admiration of the Greeks and 4,he Romans, of their progress in arts, and atchievements in arms. The narrow limits which we are apt to set to our views, in comparing the ancients with the moderns, often give rise to egregious errors In contemplating the splendid memorials of Greek and Roman renown, we fix our eyes on a few illustrious names, without deigning to cast a look on the great mass of the people, or \u2666 Eustace classical t\u00abur through Italy, vol. 1 \u2014 p. 194,"], [476, "446 COMPARISON OF THE to make any inquiry concerning their corfy dition and character.

But these poets, philosophers, and orators, whom we so greatly admire, and who stand as Pharos in the sea of literature, were few in number amidst a vast population composed of citizens and slaves, almost equally ignorant and super stitious. They were as lamps hung out to illumine an immense gloom ; and to these dis tinguished individuals belong all the applause that we are accustomed to bestow on Greek and Roman intellect; for certainly no one will imagine that the common people of Athens or Rome, during the periods of their greatest glory, could bear any comparison with the same class now existing in Great Britain, Ger many, France, or Italy, or, indeed, in any European country where books are numerous and cheap, and the means of acquiring know ledge are infinitely multiplied. Reading was not very common in Rome, and it was still less practised at Athens : even newspapers, if they existed in the former city, must, from their price, have been inaccessible to the far greater part of the people ; and we have not the least intimation of any such publications in the"], [477, "447 ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. latter.* The great majority of the inhabitants of these two celebrated cities, had no other means of acquiring information than by listen ing to the harangues of their orators in the forum. From the great expence of obtaining instruction, indeed, we may, with certainty, conclude, that the number of those who could read was comparatively small, and that not withstanding the talents displayed by a few literati, the multitude was involved in the most profound ignorance. Illumination of intellect collects its materials from the phenomena of the physical world, and from the history of man ; but in both these departments of knowledge, the ancients wanted that experience which has so greatly enlightened the moderns. \" The opinion,\" says Lord Bacon, \" which men form respecting antiquity, is vague, and incongruous with the meaning of the word.

The number of important events, and of great characters which had been pro duced, was comparatively small : history had only a narrow range, and the limits of geo graphy were yet more contracted.

In regard to the acquisition of science, and every thing relating to mental improvement, the ancients had a very great advantage over the moderns in the \u0153conomy of time. Several of the years allotted to modern education are spent in learning different languages. But the Greeks studied no other language than their own, and the Romans learned none but their own and the Greek. Their whole time might, therefore, be employed in exercising their own understandings, while a great part of modern study consists in remembering, instead of re flecting and reasoning. This disadvantage on the side of the moderns, however, is counter balanced by the advantage which they possess in having the laborious discoveries of the ancients for elementary principles of know ledge.

The first poets had a great advantage over their succes sors : the physical and moral world was all before them, unmarked by any footsteps : they could chuse their ground without having their way intercepted by any previous occupants ; and they seized on what was most striking in nature and incident. Their successors, finding the most commanding situations already occu pied, were obliged to take such posts as were less advantageous * Originality and energy characterise the poetry of the ancients : correct ness, elegance, and flowery language are the excellences most easily attainable by the moderns. f The Greek and Roman languages also being more harmonious than those now spoken in Europe, gave to ancient poetry peculiar charms. In the early ages, imagina tion, which acted by its own native powers, was stronger than judgment, which owes its correctness to observation and experience : the ancients, therefore, display greater excel lence in poetry than in history. The Greek and Roman historians narrate with force and simplicity, but they make very * See Dr. Johnson's Rasselas, ch. 10. + Dr. Johnson ubi supra."], [481, "ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. 45 1 few reflections ; nor can the most devoted admirers of antiquity pretend that Herodotus, Thucidides, or Livy, were equal to Robertson, Hume, or Gibbon, in the investigation of moral causes, or in the delineation of pictures of society. Had Gibbon adopted a less flowery and poetical stile, had he not introduced into his narrations a studied obscurity, and had he not sometimes made them a vehicle to infi delity, his celebrated work on the \" Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" might, from its extensive range and its variety of collateral matter, intimately connected, and judiciously interwoven with his principal subject, be con sidered as an historical monument greatly superior to any of those of the ancients. But this praise is not to be confined to the British historians. The \" Storia Delia Literatura Italiana\" of the Abbe Tiraboschi, is a work to which nothing similar or parallel is to be found in the whole range of Greek and Roman litera ture. During the existence of the republic, studies which had no reference to political objects were little, esteemed at Rome. It was chiefly by their supposed subserviency to popular or senatorial eloquence that the Romans were first induced lo listen to the lessons of the Grecian philosophy. Perfection in the rheto rical art was the principal object of their in- 2 F 2"], [482, "452 COMPARISON OF THE tellectual exertions : eloquence in speech, and elegance of stile, were the great excellences of their orators and writers ; and in these they are equalled by few, and certainly surpassed by none of the moderns. But in the two last centuries, Europe has produced a number of writers in various departments of literature, who display a reach of thought, a power of conception and reasoning, and an extent of observation that cannot be found in the most elegant compositions of the ancients. Even in oratory, Townsend, Flood, Pitt, Burke, Fox, Windham, and many other of our British senators, if they have not come up to the stan dard of Ciceronian eloquence, have, in the variety and complexity of the subjects which they have treated, in the, political, commercial, and moral knowledge which they have dis played, and in the vast expansion of their ideas, excelled all the celebrated orators of antiquity. With respect to the fine arts, it must be acknowledged that the ancients carried them to a degree of perfection which the moderns can only aspire to equal, but can never hope to excel. Here, indeed, they must be regarded as our masters; and the \" Chef d' \u00c6uvres\" which they have left, are, to this day, the stan dards of elegance and taste.

But it must not be forgotten, that the Grecian architecture presents itself to us with the same kind of splendid illusion that accompanies every memorial of ancient great- ness. \" The proportions of the orders,\" says a modern writer, \" it is to be remembered, are distinct subjects of beauty from the ornaments with which they are embellished, from the mag- nificence with which they are executed, from the purposes of elegance they are intended to serve, or the scenes of grandeur they were in- tended to adorn. It is in such scenes, however, and with such additions that we are accustomed to observe them ; and while we feel the effect of all these accidental associations, we are seldom willing to examine what are the causes of the complex emotion we feel, and readily attribute to the nature of the architecture itself, the whole pleasure that we enjoy. But besides these, there are other associations that we have with these forms, that still more powerfully serve to command our admiration ; for they are the Grecian orders : they derive their origin from those times, and were the ornaments of those countries which are most hallowed in our imagination.\"* This illusion, however, may, by an easy effort of the mind, be dispelled, and the proportions of the orders may be examined * Allison on Taste, vol. 2. p. 157."], [484, "454 COMPARISON OF THE without these associations.

Symmetry and just proportion are the charac teristics of the Grecian, stricking effect is that pf the Gothic architecture. Properties so dif ferent cannot admit of comparison ; but as effect is one of the principal objects of art, our Gothic cathedrals can scarcely be considered as inferior to the temples of the ancients : and although the transept of the former is an absolute loss as it does not appear in an uni formity of view like the plain paralellogram of the latter ; yet we cannot contemplate the \" Long drawn aisle and fretted vault\" without feelings of religious awe and veneration. The moderns, however, seem to acknowledge the superiority of the architectural genius of the Greeks, by adopting their orders in their most recent erections, whether for civil or reli gious purposes, as is seen in the cathedrals of St. Peter, at Rome; and St. Paul, at London, which far exceed in magnitude the most cele brated temples of the ancients. But without entering into details, it is risking nothing to"], [485, "455 ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. assert that the structures of modern Europe sur pass, at present, all those of the ancient world. Augutus could boast that he found Rome of brick and left it of marble, and succeeding em perors adorned that capital of the world with many magnificent edifices and splendid embel lishments. But there is great reason to be lieve that ancient Rome, when mistress of the world, was not superior to modern Rome in the magnificence of its structures. It is cer tain, at least, that without excepting even the temple of Diana at Ephesus, or the Parthe non at Athens, the cathedral church of St. Peter is far superior to any of the celebrated structures of antiquity. In sculpture as well as in architecture we must acknowledge the ancients as our masters. Their works are the standard of excellence and the models of modern art. Their religion was peculiarly favourable to genius of the sculptor. The embellish mem^|f their temples, with the statues of gods andVherocs, con stantly called superior talents into exertion ; and modern genius has scarcely ever been able to produce any thing equal to the models left by the ancients.

Architecture and sculpture are therefore the arts in which the ancients may fairly be con sidered as superior to the moderns, since whatever degree of perfection the latter have attained has been the result of studying and imitating the Grecian models. But in the sciences the ancients were extremely deficient. In astronomy their knowledge was trifling. The Chaldeans are supposed to have been the first people by whom it was cultivated, a cir cumstance which is ascribed partly to their early civilization, and partly to the nature of their country and climate ; for in the midst of extensive plains, under a serene sky, they had, during the greatest part of the year, an oppor tunity of observing the motions of the celestial orbs, without being impeded by the interven tion of clouds or foggy weather.* Herodotus attributes to the Babylonians the invention of the gnomon, the knowledge of the pole and the division of the day into twelve equal parts; and he gives us reason to believe that the Egyptians were indebted to them for the rudi- \u00bb Aristotle de Ccsl . lib. 2. cap. 12."], [487, "457 ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. ments of astronomical science,* Diodorus Siculus pretends to describe the extent of their astronomical attainments, but he lived too long after the extinction of the Babylo- nian empire, to be deemed an authoritative evidence. f Either they or the Egyptians had divided the zodiac into twelve signs, and the year into twelve months of thirty days each, with intercalary days to supply the deficiency. Thales, who had travelled into Egypt, has been celebrated as the first of the Grepks that predicted an eclipse ; but there is no authentic proof of his having made an exact calculation of its time. The most famed of the Grecian astronomers were Hipparchus and Ptolemy, but their advances sink into insignificancy when compared with those of Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus, Cassini, Newton, Flamstead, Hal ley, De la Lande, and other celebrated mo derns. When we consider that the ancients had no telescopes, nor numerical figures, and were ignorant of logarithms and fluxions, we may readily conceive that their astronomical observations must have been very defective, and their calculations exceedingly tedious and difficult. Under such disadvantages it was im possible that the science of astronomy should * Vide Herodot. lib. 2. cap. 109. t Diod. Sicul. lib. 2. p. 98. Diod.

The most learned of the Romans supposed the torrid zone to be wholly uninhabitable by reason of excessive heat and aridity.* They were ignorant of the existence of America: they knew scarcely any thing of India, and nothing of China :f even that part of Europe which lies to the north of the Danube was to them almost \" terra incognita.\" In every re spect the geographical knowledge of the ancients was contemptible.^ Navigation, considered as a science, may be said to have been almost wholly unknown to the Greeks and the Romans, as well as to all the other nations of antiquity. Their igno rance of the compass rendered it extremely dangerous to launch out far into the open seas, and obliged them to creep along the shores. Among the ancients the whole art of naviga ting with safety consisted in following the rule prescribed by Propertius, * Cicero Somnium Scipionis. The Romans scarcely knew any thing of Germany before the expeditions of Drusus and Germanicus. t Straho was totally ignorant of China, and the countries forming what is commonly called the farther peninsula of India.

Such ignorance in the art of navigation was sufficient to deter them from undertaking long voyages and making distant discoveries, al though they did not want the courage and per severance necessary for such enterprises ; for it must be acknowledged that, in their circum stances, the voyages of the Ph\u0153nicians to Great Britain were greater undertakings than those of the Europeans to the East Indies or China; and that the circumnavigation of the African con tinent by the fleet of IN echo, king of Egypt, six hundred and four years before the christian \u00e6ra was, beyond all comparison, a more daring and difficult attempt than the circumnavigations of the globe by the moderns. After that extraordi nary voyage the spirit of nautical enterprise seems to have long been retrograde, or at least stationary. The Greeks never surpassed, per haps never equalled, the Ph\u0153nicians in mari time affairs ; and the Romans never concerned themselves with navigation any further than in rendering it subservient to war. But amongst the nations of modern Europe, the nautical art has been brought to a state of perfection that would have been deemed impossible by the ancients ; and it has produced effects of the * Proper!, lib. 3."], [490, "460 COMPARISON OF THE greatest importance. Besides the discovery of a new world, the coasts of every part of the globe have been explored ; and the moderns have become well acquainted with countries far beyond the limits of Greek and Roman geography. If we examine the boasted philosophy of the Greeks, we shall find that it consisted rather of ideal hypotheses than of real discoveries, and accurate knowledge. In comparing the ancients and moderns, with respect to their ac quaintance with nature, weshall find the former very far inferior to the latter in the variety and correctness of their information. The ancient philosophers were too deeply engaged in sub lime speculations relative to general principles, to interest themselves in minute details con cerning particular objects. Their views were directed not so much to the qualities and uses of natural bodies, as to metaphysical theories ; and their principal aim was to ex ercise themselves in the arts of disputation. These philosophers, indeed, were too few in number, and had too contracted a sphere of observation to enable them to examine minute ly the system of nature. The extensive diffu sion of learning, in modern times, has multi plied in more than a hundred fold proportion, the number of persons qualified for accurate investigation, while the general communica-"], [491, "ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. 461 tion between men of learning in the different countries of Europe, has extended their sphere of observation, and enabled them to make a wider survey. But the principal cause that rendered the ancients so greatly inferior to the moderns in natural philosophy, was their neglect of ex periment. Instead of carefully observing in what manner effects were produced, by atten tively comparing them with iheir preceding and concomitant circumstances, they amused themselves with framing a variety of fanciful hypotheses on physical subjects.* Experimen tal philosophy can be traced back no farther than to the Arabians. Among the ancients, Archimedes alone attempted to open the way to discovery by experiment ; but this was a solitary instance without example in the pre ceding or imitation in the following ages. The great fault of the ancients was that of pre ferring metaphysical speculations to accurate observations of the ph\u00e6nomena of nature. The philosophy of Plato is nothing more than a tissue of grand and sublime ideas, with very little reference lo visible objects. Aristotle. Pliny, and some others paid more attention to the material world, aud acquired a more ex tensive acquaintance with nature; but their \u00bb \" The Greek philosophy, on the whole, affords little else than a picture of the imbecility of the human raiad.\" Tytler's Elements of Hist. vol. i.p. 111."], [492, "462 COMPARISON OF THE writings will bear no comparison either in variety of detail or accuracy of description with those of modern naturalists. That the ancients possessed a considerable degree of mechanical skill is a fact sufficiently proved by the stupendous edifices which they erected, by the weights which they removed, and especially by the lofty and ponderous obelisks which they reared, after bringing them by land or by water from a great distance. But in regard to their machinery our know ledge is very limited : they have left us but little information on this subject, except in the descriptions of their catapulta, balista, and other military engines, which were of an ex ceeding!}7 simple construction. It is evident, however, that their machinery was beyond all comparison less various as well as less complex, less powerful and commodious, and applied to infinitely fewer purposes than that of the moderns. Chemistry, a science very little known by the ancients, has, in the present times, been applied to the improvements of arts and manufactures, in a number of ways entirely new. Mathematics, as well as mechanics^ have lent their aid tow aids the production and extensive diffusion of the conveniences and comforts of life. With respect to the arts of general utility, which, spreading in numberless ramifications"], [493, "ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. 463 and multiplying themselves almost to infinity, contribute so greatly to the comforts of all classes of society, the ancients cannot be com pared to the moderns. The increase of know ledge in mechanics and chemistry has pro duced an incalculable increase of human power, which has enabled the moderns to carry manu factures to a degree of perfection, and to exe cute them with a facility unknown in the ancient world ; and the effects are seen in their cheapness and general diffusion. From the very little that we know of the price of manu factures among the Greeks and the Romans, it appears that those of the finer sort were exces sively dear. Some woollen cloths cost a hun dred denarii, or^63. 6s. 8d. per lb. weight, and others, of a particular dye, were sold at ten times that price.* The confined state of com merce contributed also to make many articles of luxury and elegance exceedingly dear. The Greeks and the Romans were not strangers to the rich merchandise of the east, but the price was exorbitant ; aud so late as the reign of the Emperor Aurelian, silk, an article of clothing so common in modern Europe, was sold at Rome for its weight in gold. From circum stances of this kind, the author of the \" Wealth of Nations\" judiciously concludes, that in the * Pliny, lib. 9, cap 19."], [494, "464 COMPARISON OF THE dress of the people of fashion, of both sexes, there was much less variety in ancient than in modern times; and this opinion seems to be sanctioned by the uniformity that is seen in the drapery of antique statues. When the expence of dress is very great, the variety must be proportionably small. But when, by the improvements made in the productive powers of manufacturing industry, the expence of dress becomes moderate, the variety will always be considerable. The machines for abridging labour, which the ingenuity of the moderns has introduced into almost even' branch of business, have enabled them to multiply the supplies of human wants, while inland naviga tion and foreign commerce facilitate the circu lation of the productions of human industry, in a manner never attempted by the ancients, and of which, indeed, they could never have formed any conception. To mention the inferiority of the ancients when compared with the moderns, in regard to religious knowledge, is almost superfluous. The theological ideas of the Greeks and the Romans were, if possible, more absurd than those of the most despicable fanatics that have ever appeared in modern Europe. In the schools of Athens, and the other seats of learn ing, the youth, it is true, were instructed to reject and despise the superstitions of the"], [495, "ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. 465 multitude. It was, indeed, impossible that a philosopher should receive, as divine truths, the tales of the poets and the incoherent tra ditions of antiquity. The philosophers medi tated on the divine nature as a curious and interesting speculation ; and in the profound inquiry, they displayed the strength and weakness of the human intellect ; while the great mass- of the people remained in all the darkness of ignorance. If from the sublime but often extravagant conceptions of Pytha goras, Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero, we descend to Plotinus, Porphyry, Jamblicus, the emperor Julian, and other philosophers of the peripa tetic, stoical, and platonic schools, we cannot but be amazed at their elaborate absurdities. The religion of the Greeks and the Romans was a splendid superstructure, raised ou the crumbling basis of folly and fiction, origina ting from the hopes and fears of men, in the ages of ignorance. And a rimple peasant of the present day would be astonished at the theological blindness of the ancient philoso phers. This superiority of the moderns in religious knowledge, is owing to the light diffused by revelation, and not to any superior strength of understanding, or greater accuracy of investigation : but it is not for that reason less real aud important. 2 a"], [496, "466 COMPARISON OF THE But the arts of government and war are those by which the Greeks and Romans have chiefly attracted the admiration and applause of succeeding: ages. But both these celebrated nations appear to have been totally ignorant of the representative system, the only mode of government that is calculated to maintain tranquillity in a free state of any considerable extent and population. The ancient republics, where every national measure, after being discussed by the senate, was ultimately referred to the popular assembly, were almost continu ally in a state of tumult and confusion. The laws of a representative government are dicta ted by the collective wisdom of the nation : at Athens and Rome wise men debated, but fools decided.* An impartial examination and fair comparison will oblige the most enthusiastic admirer of the ancients to acknowledge that the best of their political systems were greatly inferior to that of Great Britain, and even to those of several other modern states. The Greeks and the Romans, by their mili tary discipline and splendid achievements in arms, acquired a renown that has dazzled the eyes, and imposed on the minds of posterity. \" The Europeans,5' says Helvetius, \" have not * Burke calls the Athenians a nation of wicked bedlamites.

To ad- duce particular examples would be unnecessary, as the whole range of history teems with proofs of the fact. We are accustomed to contemplate the Greeks and the Romans in contrast with nations to whom they were greatly superior in \u2666weapons and skill, and do not see them de- lineated on the same canvas with the modern Europeans, who have carried the art of war to a degree of perfection of which the ancients could never have formed any idea.

In regard to the general state of society, or that combination of circumstances resulting from government, laws, religion, commerce, &c. which constitutes the whole system of life and manners, it is easy to discover a very striking difference between the ancient and the modern world. It is difficult, in some respects, to pro nounce on which side the scale of happiness pre ponderates, as we cannot unite the conceptions and feelings of an ancient Greek or Roman with those of a modern European. Several regulations, however, existed among the ancients which, according to our ideas, appear scarcely compatible with social happiness. The obligation of military service, imposed on all the citizens, was a hardship of the same nature as the conscription of revolutionary France, which, in this age, has been considered as the utmost stretch of tyranny.* But we * In one respect the obligations of military service at Rome wa\u00bb less an hardship than .the conscription laws of France.

And an ancient Roman was happy amidst every hardship, in the expectation that Rome was to be the mistress of the world. Happiness, indeed, is an indefinable some thing, which depends not on external circum stances, but on the mind. There is such a thing, however, as positive misery ; and this existed to a very great extent among all the ancient nations. In contempla ting: the Greeks and the Romans, we fix our eyes on the free citizens, without casting a look on the numerous slaves. This is one of the illusory views in which those celebrated nations are seen. The people of Athens, or rather of Attica, consisted of four distinct classes: \u2014 free citizens, foreigners, free servants, and slaves.

Almost all the ancient republics were origi nally sounded on the basis of an agrarian law, which divided the public territory in a certain proportion amongst all the citizens. But the course of human affairs by succession, by ali enation, and by various causes which operate in every country, necessarily deranged this original division, and frequently threw into the possession of one person the lands which had, at first, been allotted to many. Among the Romans in particular, a few avaricious and fortunate individuals had found means to monopolize the conquered lands which, by the fundamental laws of the state, ought to have been divided amongst the citizens. In all the dissensions between the patricians and the plebeians, this was one of the chief causes of popular complaint. To remedy this incon venience some new laws were enacted ; but they were always evaded; and the inequality of fortunes continued to increase till the far greater number of citizens possessed no lands, while others had immense estates. But with out land, the manners and customs of the times rendered it difficult to a freeman to support his family and maintain the independency of his political character.

Such of the citizens, therefore, as possessed no land, had scarcely any other means of subsistence than the bounty of the candidates at the annual elections, and the regular distributions of corn and other pro visions sent as tributes from the conquered provinces.

The female sex who form one half of the human species, and without whom, as a French writer observes, the two extremes of life would be helpless, and the middle of it joyless, were in a degraded condition at Rome, and still more at Athens.* Women lived in a state of seclusion : they were in a great measure con fined to their own houses : they were excluded from public entertainments, and treated as creatures of an inferior species.

It was not till luxury had corrupted their manners, and their liberties were on the eve of their extinction, that the principal citizens of Athens and Rome began to construct mag nificent houses, and to display their opulence and splendour in private life. It is true that, in the last age of the re public and during the flourishing period of the empire, the luxury and extravagance of the Romans in their houses, furniture, feasts, ap parel, &c. as well as in their public spectacles, exceeded almost every thing that can be con ceived by a modern imagination, and would, indeed, appear incredible were it not attested * Dr. Clarke's Trav. part 2.\u2014 p. 3. + Before Rome was almost destroyed by the conflagration in the reign of Nero, who was believed to have been the incendiary, the streets were long, close, narrow and crooked.

And when we consider the pover ty of the majority of the citizens, the great number of slaves, and the exhorbitant price of the finer manufactures, as well as of several other articles of elegance and fashion, we shall be led to believe that Rome, even in the time of her greatest splendour, displayed, as at present, a remarkable mixture of magnificence and misery. It is certain that Athens, and very probable that Rome, notwithstanding the mag nificence of their public edifices, and of some private palaces, never equalled London in the general appearance of the streets, the shops and the houses, nor in the elegance of dress displayed by the inhabitants. And it requires very little historical reading and reflexion to enable us to see that, with respect to the state of morals and intellect, these celebrated cities of the ancient world were greatly inferior to most of the modern European capitals.
