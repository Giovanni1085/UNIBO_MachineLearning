J_T is fomewhat extraordinary, that an event {o replete with tragic incidents as the French Revolution, fhould not have given to the Stage, or to the Prefs, any regular dramatic piece.' Befides the copious materials which prefent themfelves for fuch a work, it is ob vious that a theatrical reprefentation, founded either on fome particular private enormity, or on fome one of the more glaring public crimes, with which Democracy has for thefe laft three years defolated France, could not but be attended with very good effects on the minds of our own countrymen. Every true Englifhman, every real Friend of Liberty, may indeed rejoice that the prefent attachment to the Monarch and ConlUtution is fo great, as to ftand in little need of fur ther incitement ; but, as in all cafes it is more eafy to prevent than to remedy evils, it might not be impolitic, thro' the medium A of"], [6, "PREFACE. VI of the Stage, to confirm the Public good fenfe, rather than to leave it unguarded, to the machinations of the perverted or the defperate. And this is the more defireable, for that there are not wanting grave perfons, who affect to make light of the atrocious crimes which are daily perpetrated in France, when put in competition with the grand object which that Nation is faid to have in view : \u2014 a molt pernicious doctrine, which, if once infUlled into the minds of our people, as it but too fuccefsfully has been into thofe of the French, muff lead to every thing that is horrible and flagitious. Now the Stage, as it is one of the moil effe6tual means of gaining the public ear, fo is it mofl powerfully calculated to influ ence the public mind ; and though it may not at prefent greatly avail itfelf of this ho nourable and ufeful part of its office, the original inftitution is however by no means anfwerable for the negledt. On this fubje\u00a3t, ieverity or ridicule would be equallv trite ; be it then only obferved, that the revival of all the powers and energies ,of the Stage, at"], [7, "PREFACE VII at all times highly to be wifhed, was never, perhaps, of greater importance than at this critical juncture*. Nor is the pre fent age without dramatic writers eminently capable of effecting this end; though, for obvious reafons, they have maintained but too long a filence. Could any fuch have been induced to come forward on this occafion, the Author of the following Piece had molt willingly fpared his labours. It was then, in the general filence, that the circumftances which form the ground work of T'he Count de Villeroi, flruck him as calculated to produce aninterefling Drama. He arranged the outlines of each a\u00a3l, and was confirmed in his opinion. Still, how ever (having given but little of his time to poetry) a play in five acls appeared fo for midable an undertaking, that it was with difficulty he could prevail on himfelf to pro ceed. ' * The National Affembly, it feems, are not unacquainted with the powerful affiftance to be derived by Government from the Stage ; but by the pieces which they have ordered to be adted, as'well old as thofe compofed for the purpofe, they have gained an aftonifliing encreafe of popularity to their caufe : aftoniftiing to thofe who have never conlidered the influence of theatrical performances. A 2 One"], [8, "VIII PREFACE. One tragedy only occurred, of confider able merit, which was not the work of a profeffed poet ; and the excellence of that, in deed, is fo great, that it ought rather, per haps, to have made him throw down his pen in defpair, than animated him to proceed. Thofe who are acquainted with the Mjflerious Mother, will not look further for the work which is here intended : that its Author is not a pro fe fled poet is certain ; and it is faid, that this is his only dramatic compofition. However this may be, we fhall not eafily find a piece in which elegance of language, unity of defign, ftrict prefervation of character, with all the higher excellencies of tragedy\u2014 the power of exciting pity, terror, diltrefs, and horror for guilt, are more eminently united. This is not the place to enter at large into its merits ; be it only faid, that the Stage has yet to furnifh two more highly finifhed characters than thofe of the Countefs and Benedict. That the Myfterious Mother has never appeared upon the Stage, is owing, it feems, to the Author's fcruples reflecting the fubjedt ; in which, though he may be right, there are few who read his play with out being ftrongly difpofed to conteft it with him. With this example then in view, but without"], [9, "IX PREFACE. without the fmalleft hopes of equalling it, and for the reafons above-mentioned, the prefent Tragedy was taken in hand. With regard to the manner in which the Author has told his ftory, he waits with refpect for the judgment of his Readers: \u2014 \u25a0 concerning the matter of it, a few words may be neceflaiy. He has been allied, whether his play is founded in fafl? It is a fact that Sons have denounced (to ufe their own words) their Fathers, and Fathers their Children, both in the Jacobin Club and the Convention, on the very fame grounds that young Villeroi denounces his Father. It is a fact, that the King and Queen were inhumanly treated in prifon : it is a fact, that there was a defign to murder them there by a hired Mob, and that that Mob was in the pay of fome of the molt popular Leaders : it is a fact, there was a deteftable maflacre on the fecond and third of September, 1792: and it is a fact, that feveral perfons were burnt alive in it. With refpect to the atrocious circumftances which attended the murder of two Girls, one"], [10, "PREFACE. X one of fifteen, the other of eight or nine years old, as recounted by D'Orville, the Author has to fay, that the particulars ap peared in the molt authentic narratives of that maffacre ; nor have they ever been con tradicted with authority. It is prefumed that this is fufficient ground, and more than fufficient, confidering the nature of the work, for the ufe which he has made of it. To thofe who may be difpofed to cenfure fome pretty clofe imitations of two of our moft celebrated writers, the Author begs to anfwer in the words of Terence, on a fomewhat fimilar occafion : \" Quod illi malediclum vehemens eiTe exiftumant, \" Earn laudem hie ducit maxumam.\" He has alio to acknowledge the having made all the ufe he could of the fecond fcene, firft act, of the Brutus of M. de Voltaire ; feveral lines of which he has tianflated and introduced into the converfation between old Villeroi and his Son. It remains to add, that fome fteps were taken to bring this piece upon the Stage ; but for"], [11, "PREFACE. XI for want of theatrical intereft, they very naturally failed of fuccefs. If then it be aiked why, difappointed in this principal object, he did not quietly confign it to obli vion, he anfwers, \u2014 That it is his opinion, in times like the prefent, every man who is fatisfied with the Government under which he lives, fhould give fome teftimony of this fatisfaction ; if not fuch as he would wifh, the beft that he is able.
