IT is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity ; therefore I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity that I pretend at all to write my life ; but this Narrative shall con tain little more than the History of my Writings ; as, Indeed, almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object: of vanity. I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother : My father's family is a branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses for several generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College of Justice : The title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother. My family, however, was not rich, and being myself a younger brother, my patrimony, according to the mode of my country, was of course very slender. A 3 My"], [12, "MY OWN LIFE VI My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me with an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I passed through the ordinary course of education with success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments. My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my industry, gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me ; but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pur suits of philosophy and general learning ; and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was se cretly devouring. My very slender fortune, however, being unsuit able to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I was tempted, of rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life. In 1734 I went to Bristol, with some recommendations to eminent merchants ; but in a few months found that scene to tally unsuitable to me. I went over to France with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat 5 and I there laid that plan of life which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to re gard every object as contemptible, except the im provement of my talents in literature. During my retreat in Fiance, first at Rheims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou, I composed my"], [13, "MY OWN LIFE. VII my Treatise of Human Nature. After passing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down to my mo ther and my brother, who lived at his country-house, and was employed himself very judiciously and suc cessfully in the improvement of his fortune. Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human Nature. It fell dead horn from the press, without reaching such distinc tion as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine tem per, I very soon recovered the blow, and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country. In 1742 I printed at Edinburgh the first part of my Essays: The work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappoint ment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time recovered the know ledge ofthe Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth. In 1745 I received a letter from the marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England ; I found also, that the friends and fa mily of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction, for the state of his mind and health required it. \u2014 I lived with him a twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my small fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I received an invitation from the General to A 4 attend"], [14, "via MY OWN LIFE. attend him in the same station in his military em* bassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the General, along with Sir Flarry Erskine and Captain Grant, now Ge neral Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life : I passed them agreeably, and in good company ; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune, which I called independent, though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so : In ssiort, I was now master of near a thousand pounds. I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publissiing the Treatise of Human Na ture, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual in discretion, in going to the press too early. I there fore cast the first part of that work anew in the En quiry concerning Human Understanding, which was publissied while I was at Turin, But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature. On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account of Dr. Middleton's Free Enquiry, while my performance was entirely overlooked and neg lected. A new edition, which had been publissied at London, of my Essays, moral and political, met not with a much better reception. Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made little or no impression on me. I went down in 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his country-house, for my mother was, riow dead, I there composed the second pant of my 2 Essay,"], [15, "MY OWN LIFE. IX Essay, which I called Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which is another part of myTreatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile my bookseller, A. Millar, informed me that my former publications (all but the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conver. sation ; that the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were demanded. Answers by Reverends and Right Reverends came .out two or three in a year ; and I found, by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company. However, I had a fixed resolu tion, which I inflexibly maintained, never to reply to any body ; and not being very irascible in my tem per, I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement, as I was ever more dis posed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of things ; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten thou sand a year. In 1751 I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a man of letters. In 1752 were publissied at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the fame year was publissied at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals ; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and un observed into the world. In"], [16, "i MY OWN LIFE. In 1752 the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the commandos a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the History of England ; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the accession of the house of Stuart, an epoch when I thought the mis- representations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work, I thought that I was the only historian that had at once neglected present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular pre- judices ; and as the subject was suited to every capa- city, I expected proportional applause. But miser- able was my disappointment : I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detesta- tion; Englissi, Scotch, and Irissi, Whig and Tory\u00bb churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man who had presumed to ssied a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the earl of Strafford ; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three king- doms, considerable for rank or letters, that could endure the book. I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate of Ire land, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified prelates separately sent me a message not to be discouraged. 3 \u25a0 I WAS,"], [17, "MY OWN LIFE XI I was, however, I confess, discouraged ; and had not the war at that time been breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to some provincial town ofthe former kingdom, have chan ged my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was consi derably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere. In this interval, I publissied at London my Na tural History of Religion, along with some other small pieces : Its public entry was rather obscurej except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility, which distinguish the Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my per formance. In i 7 j\" si, two years after the fall of the first vo lume, was publissied the second volume of my His tory, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother. But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the slate and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther study, reading, or recollection engaged me to make in the reigns ofthe two first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridi culous to consider the Englissi constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty. In"], [18, "Till MY OWN LIFE In 1759 I publissied my History of the House of Tudor. The clamour against this performapce was almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particu larly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the impressions of public folly, and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edin burgh, to finissi, in two volumes, the more early part ofthe Englissi History, which I gave to the pub fic in r 761, with tolerable, and but tolerable, success. But notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances, that the copy money given me by the booksellers much exceeded any thing formerly known in England ; I was be come not only independent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to set my foot out of it ; and retaining the satis faction of never having preferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of friendssiip to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near prospect of being appointed se cretary to the embassy ; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This osier, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was reluctant to begin connections with the great, and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris would prove disagreeable to a per son of my age and humour : But on his Lordssiip's repeating the invitation, I accepted of it. I have every"], [19, "xm MY OWN LIFE every reason, both of pleasure and interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother General Conway. Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and sta tions. The more I resiled from their excessive ci vilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life. I was appointed secretary to the embassy ; and, in summer, 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being ap pointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was Charge d' Affaires till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards the end of the year. In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next summer went to Edin burgh, with the same view as formerly, of burying myself in a philosophical retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's friendssiip, than I left it, and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a competency. But in 1767 I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be Un der-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the person, and my connexions with Lord Hert ford, prevented me from declining. I returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very opulent (for I possessed a revenue of ioool. a-year) healthy, and though some what stricken, in years, with the prospect of enjoying long"], [20, "MY OWN LIFE XIV long my ease, and of seeing the encrease of my re putation. In spring 1775 I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as 1 apprehend it, become mortal and incur able. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder ; and what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a mo ment's abatement of my spirits ; insomuch, that were I to name a period of my life which I ssiould most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the fame ar dour as ever in study, and the fame gaiety in com pany. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities ; and though I fee many symptoms of my literary re putation's breaking out at last with additional lustre, I knew that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present. To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or rather was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments) ; I was, I fay, a man of mild disposition, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of at tachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappoint ments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary ; and as I took a particular pleasure in the company"], [21, "*v MY OWN LIFE. company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men, anywise eminent, have found reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth ; and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and con duct : Not but that the zealots, we may well sup pose, would have been glad to invent and propa gate any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral orarion of myself; but I hope it is not a misplaced one ; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.

TH E curiosity, entertained by all civilized nations, of enquiring into the exploits and adventures of their ancestors, commonly excites a regret that the history of remote ages should always be so much involved in obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction. Ingenious men, possessed of leisure, are apt to push their researches beyond the period in which literary monuments are framed or preserved ; without reflecting, that the history of past events is immediately lost or disfigured when entrusted to me mory and oral tradition, and that the adventures of barbarous nations, even if they were recorded, could afford little or no entertainment to men born in a more cultivated age. The convulsions of a civilized Vol. I.

The only certain means by which nations can indulge their curiosity in researches concerning their remote origin, is to consider the language, manners, and customs of their ancestors, and to com- pare them with those of the neighbouring nations. The sables which are commonly employed to sup- ply the place of true history, ought entirely to be disregarded ; or if any exception be admitted to this general rule, it can only be in favour of the ancient Grecian fictions, which are so celebrated and so agreeable, that they will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind. Neglecting, therefore, all traditions, or rather tales, concerning the more early history of Britain, we shall only consider the state ofthe inhabitants as it appeared to the Romans on their invasion of this country : We shall briefly run over the events which attended the conquest made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than British story : We shall hasten through the obscure and uninteresting period of Saxon Annals : And shall reserve a more full narration for those times when the truth is both so well ascertained and so complete as to promise entertainment and in struction to the reader. All ancient writers agree in representing the first Inhabitants of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celt\u00e6, who peopled that island from the neighbour ing continent. Their language was the lame, their manners, their government, their superstition ; va ried only by those small differences, which time or a communication with the bordering nations must necessarily introduce. The inhabitants of Gaul, espe- cially"], [29, "THE BRITONS 3 CHAP I. cially in those parts which lie contiguous to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with their southern neighbours, some refinement in the arts, which gra dually diffused themselves northwards, and spread but a very faint light over this island. The Greek and Roman navigators or merchants (for there were scarcely any other travellers in those ages) brought back the most shocking accounts of the ferocity of the people, which they magnified, as usual, in order to excite the admiration of their countrymen. The south-east parts, however, of Britain, had already, before the age of C\u00e6sar, made the first and most requisite step towards a civil settlement ; and the Bri tons, by tillage and agriculture, had there increased to a great multitude a. The other inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves hy pasture : They were clothed with skins of beasts : They dwelt in huts, which they reared in the forests and marshes, with which the country was covered : They shifted easily their habitation, when actuated either by the hopes of plunder, or the fear of an enemy : The convenience of seeding their cattle was even a suffi cient motive for removing their seats : And as they were ignorant of all the refinements of life, their wants and their possessions were equally scanty and limited. The Britons were divided into many small na tions or tribes ; and being a military people, whose sole property was their arms and their cattle, it was impossible, after they had acquired a relish for li berty, for their princes or chieftains to establish any despotic authority over them. Their governments, though monarchical b, were free, as well as those of all the Celtic nations ; and the common people seem even to have enjoyed more liberty among them% than among the nations of Gaul\", from whom they wsre descended.

The religion of the Britons was one ofthe most considerable parts of their government ; and the Druids, who were their priests, possessed great au thority among them. Besides ministering at the altar, and directing all religious duties, they presided over the education of youth ; they enjoyed an im munity from wars and taxes; they possessed both the civil and criminal jurisdiction ;'they decided all con troversies among states as well as among private persons, and whoever refused to sisbmit to their decree was exposed to the most severe penalties. The sentence of excommunication was pronounced against him : He was forbidden access to the sacri fices or public worship : He was debarred all inter course with his fellow-citizens, even in the common affairs of life : His company was universally shun ned, as profane and dangerous : He was refused the protection of law s : And death itself became an acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he was exposed. Thus, the bands of go vernment, which were naturally loose among that rude and turbulent people, were happily corrobo rated by the terrors of their superstition. No species of superstition was ever more terrible than that of the Druids. Besides the severe penal ties, which it was in the power of the ecclesiastics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal transmigration of souls ; and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of their timorous vo taries. They practised their rites in dark groves or other secret recesses5 ; and in order to throw a greater , mystery over their religion, they communicated their c Tacit. Agr. ' C\u00e6sar, lib 6.

Human sacrifices were practised among them : The spoils of war were often devoted to their divinities ; and thev punished with the severest tor tures whoever dared to secrete any part ofthe conse crated offering : These treasures they kept in woods and forests, secured by no other guard than the ter rors of their religion h ; and this steady conquest over human avidity may be regarded as more signal than their prompting men to the most extraordinary and most violent efforts. No idolatrous worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the ancient Gauls and Britons ; and the Romans, after their conquest, finding it impossible to recon cile those nations to the laws and institutions of their masters, while it maintained its authority, were at last obliged to abolish it by penal statutes; a vio lence which had never, in any other instance, been practised by those tolerating conquerors '. The ROMANS. HTHE Britons had long remained in this rude but independent state, when C\u00e6sar, having over run all Gaul by his victories, first cast his eye on their island. He was not allured either by its riches or its renown ; but being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new world, then mostly un known, he took advantage of a short interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an invasion on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention, were sensible of the unequal contest, and endeavoured to appease him by submissions, which, however, retarded not the execution of his design. After some resistance, he landed, as is supposed, at Deal ; and having ob- h C\u00e6sar, lib. 6. ' Sueton. in vita Claudii. tained B3"], [32, "o CHAP J. Ii \u2014 y .1 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. tained several advantages over the Britons, and ob? liged them to promise hostages for their future obe dience, he was constrained, by the necessity of his affairs, and the approach of winter, to withdraw his forces into Gaul. The Britons, relieved from the terror of his arms, neglected the performance of their stipulations ; and that haughty conqueror resolved next summer to chastise them for this breach of treaty. He landed with a greater force; and though he found a more regular resistance from the Britons, who had united under Caffivelaunus, one of their petty princes, he discomfitted them in every action. He advanced into the country ; passed the Thames in the face of the enemy ; took and burned the ca pital of Caffivelaunus ; established his ally, Mandu bratius, in the sovereignty of the Trinobantes ; and having obliged the inhabitants to make him new submissions, he again returned with his army into Gaul, and left the authority of the Romans more nominal than real in this island. The civil wars which ensued, and which prepared the way for the establishment of monarchy in Rome, saved the Britons from that yoke which was ready to be imposed upon them. Augustus, the successor of C\u00e6sar, content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own country, was little ambitious of acquiring fame by foreign wars ; and being appre hensive lest the fame unlimited extent of dominion, which had subverted the republic, might also over whelm the empire, he recommended it to his suc cessors never to enlarge the territories of the Ro mans. Tiberius, jealous ofthe fame which might be acquired by his generals, made this advice of Augustus a pretence for his inactivity k.

Without seeking any more justifiable rea sons of hostility than were employed by the late Eu ropeans in subjecting the Africans and Americans, they sent over an army under the command ofTlau tius, an able general, who gained some victories, and made a considerable progress in subduing the inha bitants. Claudius himself, finding matters sufficient ly prepared for his reception, made a journey into Britain, and received the submission of several British states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Kegni, and Trino bantes, who inhabited the south-east parts of the island, and whom their possessions and more culti vated manner of life rendered willing to purchase peace at the expence of their liberty. The other Britons, under the command of Caractacus, still maintained an obstinate resistance, and the Romans made little progress against them ; till Ostorius Scapula was sent over to command their armies. This general advanced the Roman conquests over the Britons ; pierced into the country of the Si ]ures a warlike nation, who inhabited the banks of the Severne ; defeated Caractacus in a great battle ; took him prisoner, and sent him to Rome, where his magnanimous behaviour procured him better treat ment than those conquerors usually bestowed on captive princes ', Notwithstanding these misfortunes, the Bri tons were not subdued; and this island was regarded by the ambitious Romans as a field in which mili tary honour might still be acquired. Under the reign of Nero, Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command, and prepared to signalize his name by victories over those barbarians. Finding that the island of Mona, now Anglesey, was the chief feat 1 Tacit. Ann. lib. 12, of B4"], [34, "s CHAP, I.

The Britons endeavoured to obstruct his landing on this sacred island, both by the force of their arms, and the terrors of their religion. The women and priestswere intermingled with thesoldiers upon the shore ; and running about with flaming torches in their hands, and tossing their dishevelled hair, they struck greater terror into the astonished Romans by their howlings, cries, and execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was able to inspire. But Suetonius, exhorting his troops to despise the menaces of a superstition which they de spised, impelled them to the attack, drove the Bri tons off the field, burned the Druids in the fame fires which those priests had prepared for their captive enemies, destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars ; and, having thus triumphed over the reli gion of the Britons, he thought his future progress would be easy, in reducing the people to subjection. But he was disappointed in his expectations. The Britons, taking advantage of his absence, were all in arms ; and headed by Boadicea, queen of- the Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignomi nious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked with success several settlements of their in sulting conquerors. Suetonius hastened to the pro tection of London, which was already a flourishing Roman colony ; but he found on his arrival, that it would be requisite for the general safety to abandon that place to the merciless fury of the enemy. Lon don was reduced to ashes ; such of the inhabitants as remained in it were cruelly massacred; the Romans and all strangers, to the number of 70,000, were every where put to the sword without distinction; and the Britons, by rendering the war thus bloody, seemed determined to cut off all hopes of peace or composition with the enemy. But this cruelty was revenged"], [35, "THE ROMANS 9 CHAP I revenged by Suetonius in a great and decisive battle, where 80,000 of the Britons are said to have pe rished ; and Boadicea herself, rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life by poison\"1. Nero soon after recalled Sue tonius from a government, where, by suffering and inflicting so many severities, he was judged im proper for composing the angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After some interval, Cerealis received the command from Vespasian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman arms. Julius Frontinus succeeded Cerealis both in autho rity and in reputation : But the general who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this island, was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and dis tinguished himself in that scene of action. This great commander formed a regular plan for subduing Britain, and rendering the acquisition use ful to the conquerors. He carried his victorious arms northwards, defeated the Britons in every encounter, pierced into the inaccessible forests and mountains of Caledonia, reduced every state to subjection in the southern part ofthe island, and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude under the victors. He even defeated them in a decisive action, which they fought under Gal gacus, their leader ; and having fixed a chain of garrisons, between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he thereby \u00abet off the ruder and more barren parts of the island, and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the barbarous inhabitants \". During these military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace. He introduced laws and ci vility among the Britons, taught them to desire and raise all the conveniencies of life, reconciled them to 1,1 Tack. Ann. lib. 14. \" Tacit.

The inhabitants, having experienced how unequal their own force was to resist that of the Romans, acquiesced in the dominion of their masters, and were gradually in corporated as a part of that mighty empire. This was the last durable conquest made by the Romans: and Britain, once subdued, gave no far ther inquietude to the Victor. Caledonia alone, de fended by its barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Romans entertained for it, sometimes in fested the more cultivated parts of the island by the incursions of its inhabitants. The better to secure the frontiers of the empire, Adrian, who visited this island, built a rampart between the river Tyne and the frith of Solway : Lollius Urbicus, under Anto ninus Pius, erected one in the place where Agricola had formerly established his garrisons : Severus, who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his arms to the most northern extremity of it, added new for tifications to the wall of Adrian ; and during the reigns of all the Roman emperors, such a profound tranquillity prevailed in Britain, that little mention is made ofthe affairs of that island by any historian. The only incidents which occur, are some seditions or rebellions of the Roman legions quartered there, and some usurpations of the imperial dignity by the Roman governors. The natives, disarmed, dispir rited, and submissive, had lost all desire, and even idea, of their former liberty and independence. But the period was now come when that enormous fabric of the Roman empire, which had diffused slavery and oppression, together with peace ynd civility, over so considerable a part of the globe, was approaching towards its final dissolution.

The emperors found themselves obliged to recruit their legions from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war, though languishing, was not totally extinct ; and these mercenary forces, careless of laws and civil institutions, established a military govern ment, no less dangerous to the sovereign than to the people. The farther progress ofthe fame disorders introduced the bordering barbarians into the service of theRomans ; and those fierce nations, having now added discipline to their native bravery, could no longer be restrained by the impotent policy of the emperors, who were accustomed to employ one in the destruction of the others. Sensible of their own force, and allured by the prospect of so rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, assailed at once all the frontiers ofthe Roman empire ; and having first satiated their avi dity by plunder, began to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted provinces. The more distant barba- rians, who occupied the deserted habitations of the former, advanced in their acquisitions, and pressed with their incumbent weight the Roman state, al- ready unequal to the load which it sustained. In- stead of arming the people in their own defence, the emperors recalled ail the distant legions, in whom alone they could repose confidence ; and collected the whole military force for the defence of the ca- pital and centre of the empire.

But that province, though secured by the sea against the inroads ofthe greater tribes of barbarians, found enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage of its present defence less situation. The Picts and Scots, who dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incursions upon their peaceable and effeminate neighbours ; and besides the temporary depredations which they committed, these combined nations threatened the whole province with subjection, or what the inhabitants more dreaded, with plunder and devastation. ThePictsseem to have been a tribeof the native British race, who, having been chased into the northern parts by the conquests of Agricola, had there intermingled with the ancient inhabitants: The Scots were derived from the fame Celtic origin, had first been established in Ireland, had migrated to the north west coasts of this island, and had long been accustomed, as well from their old as their new seats, to infest the Roman province by piracy and rapine*. These tribes, finding their more opulent neighbours exposed to invasion, soon broke over the Roman wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms ; and though a contemptible enemy in themselves, met with no resistance from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britons, accustomed to have recourse to the em perors for defence as well as government, made sup plications to Rome ; and one legion was sent over for their protection. This force was an overmatch for the barbarians, repelled their invasion, routed them in every engagement, and having chafed them into their ancient limits, returned in triumph to the defence of the southern provinces of the empire p.

That they might leave the island with the better grace,the Romans assisted them in erecting anew the wall of Severus, which was built entirely of stone, and which the Britons had not at that time artificers skilful enough to repair\".

Gratian also and Constantine, two Romans, who had a little before assumed the purple in Britain, had carried over to the continent the flower of the British youth; and having perished in their unsuccessful attempts on the imperial throne, had despoiled the island of those who, in this desperate extremity, were best able to defend it.

The Britons, already subdued by their own fears, found the ramparts but a weak defence for them ; and deserting their station, left the country entirely open to the inroads of the barbarous enemy. The invaders carried devasta- tion and ruin along with them ; and exerted to the utmost their native ferocity, which was not mitigated by the helpless condition and submissive behaviour of the inhabitants \\ The unhappy Britons had a third time recourse to Rome, which had declared its resolution for ever to abandon them. \u00c6tius, the patrician, sustained, at that time, by his valour and magnanimity, the tottering ruins of the empire, and revived for a moment, among the degenerate Ro- mans, the spirit, as well as discipline, of tjjeir an- cestors. The British ambassadors carried to him the letter of their countrymen, which was inscribed, The Groans ofthe Britons. The tenor of the epistle was suitable to its superscription. The barbarians, say they, on the one hand, chafe us into the sea ; the sea on the other, throws us back upon the barbarian1,; and we have only the hard choice left us, of perishing hy the sword or by the waves l. But \u00c6tius, pressed by the arms of Attila, the most terrible enemy that ever assailed the empire, had no leisure to attend to the complaints of alliec, whom generosity alone could induce him to assist u. The Britons, thus rejected., were reduced to despair, deserted their habitations, abandoned tillage, and flying for protection to the forests and mountains, suffered equally from hunger and from the enemy.

The Britons, entirely occupied in the enjoyment ofthe present interval of peace, made no provision for resisting the enemy, who, invited by their former timid behaviour, soon threatened them with a new invasion.

Kingly government, even when established among the Germans (for it was not universal), possessed a very limited Authority ; and though the sovereign was usually chosen from among the royal family, he was directed in every measure by the common consent of the nation over whom he presided. When any important affairs were transacted, all the warriors met in arms ; the men of greatest authority em ployed persuasion to engage their consent ; the peo ple expressed their approbation by rattling their ar mour, or their dissent by murmurs ; there was no necessity for a nice scrutiny of votes among a mul titude, who were usually carried with a strong Cur rent to one side or the other ; and the measure, thus suddenly chosen by general agreement, was executed with alacrity, and prosecuted with vigour. Even in war, the princes governed more by example than by authority : But in peace, the civil union was in a great measure dissolved, and the inferior leaders administered justice after an independent manner, each in his particular district.

The warriors of each tribe attached themselves to their leader with the most devoted affection and most unfliaken con stancy. They attended him as his ornament in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in the administration of justice. Their constant emulation in military renown dissolved not that inviolable friendship which they professed to their chieftain and to each other. To die for the honour of their band was their chief ambition : To survive its disgrace, or the death of their leader, was infamous. They even carried into the field their women and children, who adopted all the martial sentiments of the men ; And being thus impelled by every human motive, they were invincible ; where they were not opposed either by the similar manners and institutions of the neighbouring Germans, or by the superior dis cipline, arms, and numbers of the Romans b. The leaders and their military companions were maintained by the labour of their slaves, or by that of the weaker and less warlike part of the commu nity whom they defended.

All the refined arts of life were unknown among the Germans : Tillage itself was almost wholly ne glected : They even seem to have been anxious to prevent any improvements of that nature ; and the leaders, by annually distributing anew all the land among the inhabitants of each village, kept them from attaching themselves to particular possessions, or making such progress in agriculture as might b C\u00e6sar, lib. 6.

In order to oppose their inroads, the Ro mans had establissied an officer, whom they called Count of the Saxon shore ; and as the naval arts can flourish among a civilized people alone, they seem to have been more successful in repelling the Sax ons, than any of the other barbarians by whom they were invaded.

The Britons now began to en tertain apprehensions of their allies, whose numbers they found continually augmenting ; but thought of no remedy, except a passive submission and conniv ance.

They fought many battles with their enemies \u2022, and though the victories in these actions be disputed between the British and Saxon annalists, the progress still made by the Saxons proves that the advantage was commonly on their side.

The war still conti nued, though the success was commonly on the side of the Saxons, whose short swords, and close man ner of fighting, gave them great advantage over the missile weapons of the Britons. Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune ; and in order to ex tend his conquests, he laid siege to Mount Badon or Banesdowne near Bath, whither the most ob stinate ofthe discomfited Britons had retired. The southern Britons, in this extremity, applied for as sistance to Arthur, Prince of the Silures, whose he roic valour now sustained the declining fate of his country *. This is that Arthur so much celebrated in the songs of Thaliessin, and the other British bards, and whose military achievements have been blended with so many fables, as even to give occa^ sion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence. But poets, though they disfigure the most certain history by their fictions, and use strange liberties with truth where they are the sole historians, as among the Britons, have commonly some founda tion for their wildest exaggerations.

This misfortune stopped the progress of Cerdic : but was not sufficient to wrefl from him the conquests which he had already made. He and his son Kenric, who succeeded him, esta blished the kingdom of the West Saxons, or of Wefsex, over the counties of Hants, Dorset, Wilts, Berks, and the Isle of Wight, and left their new acquired dominions to their posterity. Cerdic died in 534, Kenric in 560. While the Saxons made this progress in the south, their countrymen were not less active in other quarters. In the year 5-27, a great tribe of adven turers, under several leaders, landed on the east coast of Britain ; and after fighting many battles, of which history has preserved no particular account, they established three new kingdoms in this island. Uffa assumed the title of king of the East- Angles in 575 ; Crida that of Mercia in 585 2 ; and Erken win that of East-Saxony or Essex nearly about the fame time, but the year is uncertain. This latter kingdom was dismembered from that ot Kent, and comprehended Essex, Middlesex, and part of Hert fordshire. That of the East-Angles, the counties of Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk ; Meroia was extended over all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the frontiers of these two kingdoms. 'Ihe Saxons, soon after the landing of Hengist, had been planted in Northumberland ; but, as they met with an obstinate resistance, and made but small progress in subduing the inhabitants, their aftairs were in so unsettled a condition, that none ot their princes for a long time assumed the appellation of king.

He entirely subdued the county now called Northumberland, the bishopric of Durham, as well as some of the south-east coun ties of Scotland ; and he assumed the crown under the title of king of Bernicia. Nearly about the fame time, \u00c6lla, another Saxon prince, having conquered Lancashire, and the greater part of Yorkshire, received the appellation of king of Dei'ri \\ These two kingdoms were united in the person of Ethilfrid, grandson of Ida, who married Acca, the daughter of \u00c6lla ; and expelling her brother Edwin, established one of the most power ful ofthe Saxon kingdoms by the title of Northum berland. How far his dominions extended into the country now called Scotland, is uncertain ; but it cannot be doubted that all the lowlands, especially the east coast of that country, were peopled in a great measure from Germany ; though the expedi tions, made by the several Saxon adventurers, have escaped the records of history. The language spo ken in those countries, which is purely Saxon, is a stronger proof of this event, than can be opposed by the imperfect, or rasher fabulous annals, which are obtruded on us by the Scottish historians. The HEPTARCHY. T^HUS was established, after a violent contest of near a hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or seven Saxon kingdoms, in Britain ; and the whole southern part of the island, except Wales and Cornwal, had totally changed its inhabitants, lan guage, customs, and political institutions. The Britons, under the Roman dominion, had made ' Ann. Beverl. p. 78. such"], [53, "*7 CHAP 1 THE HEPTARCHY. such advances towards arts and civil manners, that they had built twenty-eight considerable cities within their province, besides a great number of villages and country seats d. But the fierce conquerors, by whom they were now subdued, threw every thing back into ancient barbarity ; and those few natives, who were not either massacred or expelled their ha bitations, were reduced to the most abject slavery. None of the other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or Burgundians, though they over ran the southern provinces of the empire like a mighty torrent, made such devastations in the con quered territories, or were inflamed into so violent an animosity against the ancient inhabitants. As the Saxons came over at intervals in separate bo dies, the Britons, however, at first unwarlike, were tempted to make resistance ; and hostilities being thereby prolonged, proved more destructive to both parties, especially to the vanquished. The first in vaders from Germany, instead of excluding other adventurers, who must share with them the spoils of the ancient inhabitants, were obliged to solicit fresh supplies from their own country ; and a total ex termination of the Britons became the sole expedi ent for providing a settlement and subsistence to the new planters. Hence there have been found in history few conquests more ruinous than that of the Saxons ; and few revolutions more violent than that which they introduced. So lonsr as the contest was maintained with the natives, the several Saxon princes prelerved a union of counsels and interests ; but after the Britons were shut up in the barren counties of Cornwal and Wales, and gave no farther disturbance to the con querors, the band of alliance was in a great mea sure dissolved among the princes of the Heptarchy. Though one prince seems still to have been allowed, .<* Gildas, Bede, lib. I. or"], [54, "j.S CHAP, 1 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. or to have assumed an ascendant over the whole, his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or legal, was extremely limited ; and each state acted as if it had been independent, and wholly se parate from the rest. Wars, therefore, and revo lutions and dissensions were unavoidable among a turbulent and military people ; and these events, however intricate or confused, ought now to become the objects of our attention. But, added tp the difficulty of carrying on at once the history of seven independent kingdoms, there is great discourage ment tq a writer, arising from the uncertainty, at least barrenness, of the accounts transmitted to us. The monks, who were the only annalists during those ages, lived remote from publick affairs, con sidered the civil transactions as entirely subordinate to the ecclesiastical, and, besides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity which were then universal, were strongly infected with credulity, with the love of wonder, and with a propensity to imposture; vices almost inseparable from their profession and manner of life. The history of that period abounds in names, but is extremely barren of events , or the events are related so much without circumstances and causes, that the most profound or most elo quent writer must despair of rendering them either instructive or entertaining to the reader. Even the great learning and vigorous imagination of Milton funk under the weight ; and this author scruples not to declare, that the skirmishes of kites or crows as much merited a particular narrative, as the confused transactions and battles of the Saxon Heptarchy '. In order, however, to connect the events in some to lerable measure, we shall give a succinct account of the succession of kings, and ofthe more remarkable revolutions in each particular kingdom ; beginning with that of Kent, which was the first established. e Milton in Kennet, p. 50."], [55, "THE HEPTARCHY. 29 CHAP, I. The Kingdom of KENT. \"C* S C TJ S succeeded his father Hengist, in the kingdom of Kent ; but seems not to have pos sessed the military genius of that conqueror, who first made way for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the Saxons, who sought either the fame of valour, or new establishments by arms, flocked to the standard of \u00c6lla, king of Sussex, who was carrying on successful v/ar against the Britons, and laying the foundations of a new kingdom. Escus was content to possess in tranquillity the king dom of Kent, which he left in 5 1 2 to his son Octa, in whose time the East-Saxons established their monarchy, and dismembered the provinces of Essex and Middlesex from that of Kent. His death, after a reign of twenty-two years, made room for his son Hermenric in 534, who performed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty-two years, ex cept associating with him his son Ethelbert in the government, that he might secure the succession in his family, and prevent such revolutions as are in cident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy. Ethelbert revived the reputation of his family, which had languished for some generations. The inactivity of his predecessors, and the situation of his country, secured from all hostility with the Britons, seem to have much enfeebled the warlike genius of the Kentish Saxons ; and Ethelbert, in his first at tempt to aggrandize his country, and distinguish his own name, was unsuccessful f. He was twice dis comfited in battle by Ceaulin, king of Wessex; and obliged to yield the superiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch, who preserved no mode ration in his victory, and by reducing the kingdom of Sussex to subjection, excited jealousy in all the { Chron. Sax. p. 21. other"], [56, "3^ CHAP, 1 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. other princes. An association was formed against him ; and Ethelbert, entrusted with the_ command of the allies, gave' him battle, and obtained a de cisive victory %. Ceaulin died soon after ; and Ethelbert succeeded as well to his ascendant among the Saxon states, as to his other ambitious projects. He reduced all the princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a strict dependence upon him ; and even established himself by force on the throne of Mercia, the most extensive of the Saxon king doms. Apprehensive, however, of a dangerous league against him, like that by which he himself had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the prudence to resign the kingdom of Mercia toWebba, the rightful heir, the son of Crida, who had first founded that monarchy. But governed still by am bition more than by justice, he gave Webba posses sion of the crown on such conditions, as rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor. But the most memorable event which distin guished the reign of this great prince, was the intro duction of the Christian religion among the English Saxons. The superstition of the Germans, parti cularly that of the Saxons, was of the grossest and most barbarous kind ; and being founded on tradi tional tales received from their ancestors, not re duced to any system, nor supported by political in stitutions like that of the Druids, it seems to have made little impression on its votaries, and to have easily resigned its place to the new doctrine promul gated to them. Woden, whom they deemed the ancestor of all their princes, was regarded as the god of war, and by a natural consequence, became their supreme deity, and the chief object of their re ligious worship. They believed, that if they ob-. tained the favour of this divinity by their valour (for \u00a3 H Hunting, lib. 2. they"], [57, "3' CHAP, I, THE HEPTARCHY. they made less account of the other virtues), they should be admitted after their death into his hall ; and reposing on couches, should satiate themselves with ale from the skulls of their enemies whom they had slain in battle. Incited by this idea of pa radise, which gratified at once the passion of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling inclinations of barbarians, they despised the dangers of war, and increased their native ferocity against the vanquished by their religious prejudices. We know little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons : We only learn that they were polytheists ; that they worshipped the sun and moon ; that they adored the god of thunder, under the name of Thor ; that they had images in their temples ; that they prac tised sacrifices ; believed firmly in spells and in chantments ; and admitted in general a system of doctrines which they held as sacred, but which, like all other superstitions, must carry the air of the wildest extravagance, if propounded to those who are not familiarized to it from their earliest infancy. The constant hostilities which the Saxons main tained against the Britons, would naturally indispose them for receiving the Christian faith, when preached to them by such inveterate enemies ; and perhaps the Britons, as is objected to them by Gil das and Bede, were not overlond of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life and salvation. But as a civilized people, however subdued by arms, still maintain a sensible superiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all the other northern conquerors of Europe had been already induced to embrace the Christian faith, which they found established in the empire ; and it was impos sible but the Saxons, infoi med of this event, must have regarded with some degree of veneration a doc trine, which had acquired the ascendant over all their brethren. However limited in their views, they could not but have perceived a degree of cul- 14 tivation"], [58, "3* CHAP, I HISTORY OF ENGLAND. tivation in the southern countries beyond what they themselves possessed ; and it was natural for them to yield to that superior knowledge, as well as zeal, by which the inhabitants of the Christian king doms were even at that time distinguished. But these causes might long have failed of pro ducing any considerable effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the means of introducing Christi anity into Kent. Ethelbert, in his father's lifetime, had married Bertha, the only daughter of Caribert, king of Paris h, one of the descendants of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul ; but before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to stipulate, that the princess should enjoy the free exercise of her reli gion ; a concession not difficult to be obtained from the idolatrous Saxons1. Bertha brought over a French bistiop to the court of Canterbury ; and being zealous for the propagation of her religion, flie had been very assiduous in her devotional exer cises, had supported the credit of her faith by an ir reproachable conduct, and had employed every art of insinuation and address to reconcile her husoand to her religious principles. Her popularity in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert, had so well paved the way for the reception of the Chris tian doctrine, that Gregory, surnamed the Great, then Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of effecting a project, which he himself, before he mounted the papal throne, had once embraced, of converting the British Saxons. It happened, that this prelate, at that time in a private station, had observed in the market-place of Rome, some Saxon youth exposed to sale, whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Bri tain, had bought of their mercenary parents. Struck with the beauty of their fair complexions and bloom ing countenances, Gregory asked to what country 11 Greg, of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26. H. Hunting, lib. 2. 1 Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25.

En quiring farther concerning the name of their pro vince, he was informed that it was Dei'ri, a dis trict of Northumberland: De'iri ! replied he, that is good! They are called to the mercy of God from his anger, De ira. But what is the name of the king of that province? He was told it was \u00c6lla or Alia : Alleluia, cried he : We must endeavour that the praises of God be fung in their country. Moved by these allusions, which appeared to him so happy, he de termined to undertake, himself, a mission into Bri tain ; and having obtained the Pope's approbation, he prepared for that perilous journey : But his popularity at home was so great, that the Romans, unwilling to expose him to such dangers, opposed his design; and he was obliged, for the present, to lay aside all farther thoughts of executing that pious purpose l\\ The controversy between the Pagans and the Christians was not entirely cooled in that age ; and no pontiff, before Gregory, had ever carried to greater excess an intemperate zeal against the former religion. He had waged war with all the precious monuments of the ancients, and even with their writings, which, as appears from the strain of his own wit, as well as from the style of his compositions, he had not taste or genius sufficient to comprehend. Ambitious to distinguish his pontificate by the con version of the British Saxons, he pitched on Augus tine, a Roman monk, and sent him with forty asso ciates to preach the gospel in this island. These missionaries, terrified with the dangers which might k Bede, lib* i. cap. i. Spell. Cone. p. 91. Vol. I.

But Gregory exhorted them to per severe in their purpose, advised them to chuse some interpreters from among the Franks, who still spoke the same language with the Saxons ' ; and recom mending them to the good offices of Queen Brune haut, who at this time usurped the sovereign power in France. This princess, though stained with every vice of treachery and cruelty, either possessed or pretended great zeal for the cause ; and Gregory acknowledged that to her friendly assist ance was, in a great measure, owing the success of that undertaking10. Augustine, on his arrival in Kent, in the year 597 n, found the danger much less than he had ap- prehended. Ethelbert, already well-disposed to- wards the Christian faith, assigned him a habitation in the isle of Thanet ; and soon after admitted him to a conference. Apprehensive, however, lest spells or enchantments might be employed against him by priests, who brought an unknown worssiip from a distant country, he had the precaution to receive them in the open air, where he believed the force of their magic would be more easily dissipated0. Here Augustine, by means- of his interpreters, deli vered to him the tenets ofthe Christian faith, and promised him eternal joys above, and a kingdom in heaven without end, if he would be persuaded to receive that salutary doctrine. \" p Your words and *' promises,\" replied Ethelbert, \" are fair ; but be- 1 Bede, lib.

He attracted their attention by the austerity of his manners, by the severe pe nances to' which he subjected himself, by the absti nence and self-denial which he practised : And having excited their wonder, by a course of life which appeared so contrary to nature, he procured more easily their belief of miracles, which, it was pretended, he wrought for their conversion r. In fluenced by these motives, and by the declared favour of the court, numbers of the Kentissi men were baptized ; and the King himself was persuaded to submit to that rite of Christianity. Llis example had great influence with his subjects ; but he em ployed no force to bring them over to the new doc trine. Augustine thought proper, in the commence ment of his mission, to assume the appearance of the greatest lenity : He told Ethelbert, that the service of Christ must be entirely voluntary, and that no violence ought ever to be used in propagating so salutary a doctrine\". The intelligence received of these spiritual con quests afforded great joy to the Romans ; who now exulted as much in those peaceful trophies, as their ancestors had ever done in their most sanguinary triumphs, and most splendid victories.

The pontiff also answered some questions, which the missionary had put con cerning the government of the new church of Kent. Besides other queries, which it is not material here to relate, Augustine asked, Whether coustn germans might be al/owed to marry ? Gregory answered, that that liberty had indeed been formerly granted by the- Roman law ; but that experiencehad shewn, thatmo issue could ever come from such marriages ; and he therefore prohibited them.

And, on the whole, it appears that Gre gory and his missionary, if sympathy of manners have any influence, were better calculated, than men of more refined understandings, for making a progress with the ignorant and barbarous Saxons. The more to facilitate the reception of Christi anity, Gregory enjoined Augustine to remove the idols from the Heathen altars, but not to destroy the altars themselves ; because the people, he said, would be allured to frequent the Christian worssiip when they found it celebrated in a place which they were accustomed to revere. And as the Pagans prac tised sacrifices, and feasted with the priests on their offerings, he also exhorted the missionary to persuade them, on Christian festivals, to kill their cattle in the neighbourhood ofthe church, and to indulge them selves in those cheerful entertainments to which they had been habituated *. These political compliances shew, that notwithstanding his ignorance and pre judices, he was not unacquainted with the arts of governing mankind. Augustine was consecrated archbissiop of Canterbury, was endowed by Gregory with authority over all the British churches, and re ceived the pall, a badge of ecclesiastical honour, from Rome y. Gregory also advised him not to be too much elated with his gift of working miracles * ; and as Augustine, proud with the success of his mission, seemed to think himself entitled to extend his autho rity over the bissiops of Gaul, the Pope informed w Augustine asks, Si mulier menstrua consuetudine tenetur, an ec tlesiam inlrare ei licet, aut sacra communionis facramenta percipere ?

Ercombiirt, though the younger son, by Em ma, a French princess, found means to mount the throne. He is celebrated by Bede for two exploits, for establissiing the fast of Lent in his kingdom, and for utterly extirpating idolatry ; which, not withstanding the prevalence of Christianity, had hi therto been tolerated by the two preceding mo narchs. He reigned twenty-four years; and left the crown to Egbert his son, who reigned nine years. This prince is renowned for his encourage ment of learning ; but infamous for putting to death his two cousin-germans, sons of Erminfrid, his uncle. The ecclesiastical writers praise him for his bestowing on his sister, Domnona, some lands in the isle of Thanet, where ssie founded a monastery. The bloody precaution of Egbert could not fix the crown on the head of his son Edric. Lothaire, brother of the deceased prince, took possession of the kingdom ; and, in order to secure the power in his family, he associated with him Richard, his son, in the administration of the government.

The Britons astonissied at this event, received a total defeat : Chester was obsiged to surrender ; And Adelfrid, pursuing his victory, made himself master of Bangor, and entirely de- molissied the monastery ; a building so extensive, that there was a mile's distance from one gate of it to another, and it contained two thousand one hun- dred monks, who are said to have been there main- tained by then own labour \".

This prince, now grown to man's estate, wandered from place to place in continual danger from the attempts of Adelfrid ; and received at last protection in the Court of Redwald, king of the East-Angles ; where his engaging and gallant de portment procured him general esteem andaffection. Redwald, however, was strongly solicited by the king. os Northumberland to kill or deliver up his guest: Rich presents were promised him if he would comply ; and war denounced against him in case of his refusal.

Edwin, informed of his friend's per plexity, was yet determined at all hazards to remain in East- Anglia; and thought, that if the protection of that court failed him, it were better to die, than prolong a life so much exposed to the persecutions of his powerful rival. This confidence in Redwald's honour. and friendssiip, with his other accomplissi ments, engaged the queen on his side ; and ssie effectually represented to her husoand the infamy of delivering up to certain destruction their royal guest, who had fled to them for protection against his cruel and jealous enemies \u00b0. Redwald, embracing more generous resolutions, thought it safest to prevent Adelfrid, before that prince was aware of his inten tion, and to attack him while he was yet unprepared for defence. He marched suddenly with an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and fought a battle with Adelfrid ; in which that Monarch was defeated and killed, after avenging himself by the death of Regner, son of Redwald p: His own sons, Eanfrid, Oswald, and Oswy, yet infants, were car ried into Scotland ; and Edwin obtained possession of the crown of Northumberland. Edwin was the greatest prince of the Heptarchy in that age, and distinguissied himself both by his influence over the other kingdoms % and by the strict execution of justice in his own dominions. He reclaimed his subjects from the licentious life to which they had been accustomed ; and it was a common saying, that during his reign a woman or child might openly carry every where a purse of gold, without any danger of violence or robbery.

The East-Angles conspired against Redwald, their king ; and having put him to death, they offered their crown to Edwin, of whose valour and capacity they had had experience, while he resided among them.

Both these Northumbrian kings perissied soon after, the first in battle against C\u00e6dwalla, the Briton ; the second, by the treachery of that prince. Oswald, the brother of Eanfrid of the race of Bernicia, united again the kingdom of Northumberland in the year 634, and restored the Christian religion in his dominions. He gained a bloody and well-disputed battle against C\u00e6dwalla ; the last vigorous effort which the Bri tons made against the Saxons. Oswald is much celebrated for his sanctity and charity by the Monkissi historians ; and they pretend, that his re liques wrought miracles, particularly the curing of a sick horse, which had approached the place of his interment \\ He died in battle against Penda, king of Mercia, and was succeeded by his brother Ofwy ; who esta blissied himself in the government of the whole Northumbrian kingdom, by putting to death Oswin, the son of Osric, the last king of the race of Dei'ri..

Oswolf, son os Eadbert, was slain in a sedition, a year after his accession to the crown ; and Molla, who was not of the royal family, seized the crown. He perissied by the trea chery of Ailred, a prince ofthe blood ; and Ailred, having succeeded in his design upon the throne, was soon after expelled by his subjects. Ethelred, his successor, the son of Mollo, underwent a like fate. Celwold, the next king, the brother of Ailred, was deposed and slain by the people, and his place was filled by Oseed, his nephew, who, after a ssiort reign of a year, made way for Ethelbert, another son of Mollo, whose death was equally tragical with that of almost all his predecessors. After Ethelbert's death an universal anarchy prevailed in Northum berland ; and the people having, by so many fatal revolutions, lost all attachment to their government and princes, were well prepared for subjection to a foreign yoke ; which Egbert, king of Wessex, finally imposed upon them.

Some pretend that he founded the uni versity of Cambridge, or rather some schools in that place. It is almost impossible, and quite needless, to be more particular in relating the transactions of the East-Angles. What instruction or entertain ment can it give the reader, to hear a long bead roll of barbarous names, Egric, Annas, Ethelbert, Ethelwald, Aldulf, Elfwold, Beorne, Ethelred, Ethelbert, who successively murdered, expelled, or inherited from each other, and obscurely filled the throne of that kingdom ? Ethelbert, the last of these princes, was treacherously murdered by Offa, king of Mercia, in the year 792, and his state was thenceforth united with that of Offa, as we shall relate presently. The Kingdom of MERCIA MERCIA, the largest, if not the most power- ful, kingdom of the Heptarchy, compre hended all the middle counties of England ; and as its frontiers extended to those of all the other six kingdoms, as well as to Wales, it received its name from that circumstance. Wibba, the Ion ofCrida, founder of the monarchy, being placed on the throne by Ethelbert, king of Kent, governed his paternal dominions by a precarious authority'; and after his death, Ceorl, his kinsman, was, by the influence of the Kentissi monarch, preferred to his son Penda, whose turbulent character appeared dan gerous to that prince. Penda was thus fifty years of age before he mounted the throne; aud his te merity and restless disposition were tound nowise abated by time, experience, or reflection.

At last, Ofwy, brother to Oswald, having defeated and slain him in a decisive battle, freed the world from this sanguinary tyrant. Peada, his son, mounted the throne of Mercia in 655, and lived under the protection of Ofwy, whose daughter he had espoused. This princess was educated in the Christian faith, and ssie employed her influence with success, in converting her husband and his sub jects to that religion. Thus the fair-sex have had the merit of introducing the Christian doctrine into all the most considerable kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy. Peada died a viosent death \\ His son, Wolshere, succeeded to the government; and, after having reduced to dependence the kingdoms of Essex and East -Anglia,, he left the crown to his brother Ethelred, who, though a lover of peace, showed himself not unfit for military enterprizes. Besides making a successful expedition into Kent, he repulsed Egfrid, king of Northumberland, who had invaded his dominions ; and he slew in battle Elfwin, the brother of that prince. Desirous, how ever, of composing all animosities with Egfrid, he paid him a sum of money as a compensation for the loss of his brother. After a prosperous reign of thirty years, he resigned the crown to Kendred, son of Wolshere, and retired into the monastery of Bardney c. Kendred returned the present of the Crown to Ceolred, the son of Ethelred: and making a pilgrimage to Rome, passed his life there in pe nance and devotion.

This prince, who mounted the throne in 75c % had some great qualities, and was successful in his warlike enterprises against Lothaire, king of Kent, and Kenwulph, king of Wessex. He defeated the former in a bloody battle at Otford upon the Da rent, and reduced his kingdom to a state of de pendence : He gained a victory over the latter at Bensington in Oxfordssiire ; and conquering that county, together with that of Gloucester, annexed both to his dominions. But all these successes were stained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert, king of the East- Angles, and his violent seizing of that kingdom. This young prince, who is said to have possessed great merit, had paid his addresses to El frida, the daughter of Offa, and was invited with all his retinue to Hereford, in order to solemnize the nuptials : Amidst the joy and festivity of these en tertainments, he was seized by Offa, and secretly beheaded : And though Elfrida, who abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warning to the East- Anglian nobility, who escaped into their own country, Ossa, having extinguished the royal fa mily, succeeded in his design of subduing that kingdom '. The perfidious prince, desirous of re establissiing his character in the world, and perhaps of appeasing the remorses of his own conscience, paid great court to the clergy, and practised all the monkissi devotion so much esteemed in that igno rant and superstitious age. He gave the tenth of his goods to the church f ; bestowed rich donations on the cathedral of Hereford, and even made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his great power and riches could not fail of procuring him the papal ab solution.

This imposition, being afterwards levied on all England, was commonly denominated Peter's Pence h ; and though conferred at first as a gift, was afterwards claimed as a tribute by the Roman pontiff. Carrying his hypocrisy still far ther, Offa, feigning to be directed by a vision from heaven, discovered at Verulam the reliques of St. Alban, the martyr, and endowed a magnificent mo nastery in that place '. Moved by all these acts of piety, Malmesoury, one of the best of the old Eng lissi historians, declares himself at a loss to deter mine k whether the merits or crimes of this prince preponderated. Offa died, after a reign of thirty nine years, in 794 '. This prince was become so considerable in the Heptarchy, that the emperor Charlemagne entered into an alliance and friendssiip with him; a circum stance which did honour to Offa ; as distant prirtces at that time had usually little communication with each other. That emperor being a great lover of learning and learned men, in an age very barren of that ornament, Offa, a.t his desire, sent him over Alcuin, a clergyman much celebrated for his know ledge, who received great honours from Charle magne, and even became bis preceptor in the sciences.

This prince waged war against Kent ; and taking Egbert the king prisoner, he cut off his hands, and put out his eyes ; leaving Cuthred, his own brother, in possession ofthe crown of that kingdom. Kenulph was killed in an insurrection of the East- Anglians, whose crown his predecessor, Offa, had usurped. He left his son, Kenelm, a minor ; who was murdered the fame year by his sister, Quend rade, who had entertained the ambitious views of assuming the government p. But ssie was supplanted by her uncle, Ceolulf ; who, two years after, was dethroned by Beomulf.

This alliance proved suc cessful under the conduct of Ethelbert, king as Kent ; and Ceaulin, who had lost the affections of his own subjects by his violent disposition, and had now fallen into contempt from his misfortunes, was expelled the throne y, and died in exile and misery. Cuichelme and Cuthwin, his sons, governed jointly the kingdom, till the expulsion of the latter in 591, and the death of the former in 593, made way for Cealric, to whom succeeded Ceobald in 593, by whose death, which happened in 611, Kynegils in herited the crown.

Ina, his successor, inherited the military vir tues of Ceodwalla, and added to them the more valuable ones of ju:1ice, policy, and prudence. He made war upon the Britons in Somerset; and hav ing finally subdued that province, he treated the van quissied with a humanity hitherto unknown to the Saxon conquerors. He allowed the proprietors to retain possession of their lands, encouraged marri ages and alliances between them and his ancient subjects, and gave them the privilege of being go verned by the fame laws. These laws he aug mented and ascertained ; and though he was dis turbed by some insurrections at home, his long reign of thirty-seven years may be regarded as one of the most glorious and most prosperous of the Heptarchy. In the decline of his age he made a pilgrimage to Rome ; and after his return, ssiut himself up in a cloiiler, where he died. Though the kings of Wessex had alwrays been princes of the blood, descended from Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, the order of succession had been far from exact ; and a more remote prince had often found means to mount the throne, in prefer ence to one descended front a nearer branch of the royal family. Ina, therefore, having no children r>f his own, and lying much under the influence of Ethelburga, his queen, left by will the succession to Adelard, her brother, who was his remote kinsman : But this destination did not take place without some difficulty.

But these were so much resented by the ungrateful prince, that he conspired against the life of his pro tector, and treacherously murdered him. After this infamous action, he was forlaken by all the world ; and skulking about in the wilds and forests, was at last discovered by a servant of Cumbran's, who in stantly took revenge upon him for the murder of his master b.

Egbert, sensible of his danger from the suspicions of Brithric, secretly withdrew into France', where he was well received by Charlemagne. By living in the court, and serving in the armies of that prince, the most able and most generous that had appeared in Europe during several ages, he acquired those accomplissiments, which afterwards enabled him to make such a ssiining figure on the throne. And fa miliarizing himself to the manners of the French, who, as Malmesbury observesf. were eminent both for valour and civility above all the western nations, he learned to polish the rudeness and barbarity of the Saxon character : His early misfortunes thus proved a singular advantage to him. It was not long ere Egbert had opportunities of displaying his natural and acquired talents. Brith ric, king of Wessex, had married Eadburga, natural daughter of Offa, king of Mercia, a profligate wo man, equally infamous for cruelty and for inconti nence. Having great influence over her husband, ssie often instigated him to destroy such ofthe nobi lity as were obnoxious to her ; and where this expe dient failed, ssie scrupled not being herself active in traiterous attempts against them. She had mixed a cup of poison for a young nobleman, who had ac quired her husoand's friendssiip, and had on that account become the object of her jealousy : But, un fortunately, the king drank of the fatal cup along 'Chron. Sa::, p 16. f Lib. 2. cap. 11, * H. Hunting, lib. 4. with"], [84, "5* CHAf, J HISTORY OF ENGLAND. with his favourite, and soon after expired g. This tragical incident, joined to her other crimes, ren dered Eadburga so odious, that ssie was obliged to fly into France; whence Egbert was at the fame time recalled by the nobility, in order to ascend the throne of his ancestors11. ' He attained that dignity in the last year ofthe eighth century. In the kingdoms -ofthe Heptarchy, an exact rule of succession was either unknown or not strictly ob served ; and thence the reigning prince was conti nually agitated with jealousy against all the princes of the blood, whom he still considered as rivals, and whose death alone could give him entire security in his possession of the throne. From this fatal cause, together with the admiration of the monastic life, and the opinion of merit attending the preservation of chastity even in a married state, the royal families had been entirely extinguished in all the kingdoms except that of Wessex ; and the emulations, suspi cions, and conspiracies, which had formerly been confined to the princes ofthe blood alone, were new diffused among all the nobility in the several Saxon states. Egbert was the sole descendant of those first conquerors who subdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree from Woden, the supreme divinity of their ancestors. But that prince, though invited by this favourable circum stance to make attempts on the neighbouring Sax ons, gave them for some time no disturbance, and rather chose to turn his arms against the Britons in Cornwall, whom he defeated in several battles'. He was recalled from the conquest of that country by an invasion made upon his dominions by Ber nulf, king of Mercia. S Higden, lib. 5. M. West. p. 152. Aster, in vita Alfredi, p. 3. a edit.

Northumberland was involved in anarchy ; arid no state of any conse quence remained but that of Wessex, which, much inferior in extent to Mercia, was supported solely by the great qualities of its sovereign. Egbert led his armv against the invaders ; and encountering them at Ellandum in Wihssiire, obtained a complete vic tory, and by the great slaughter which he made of them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians.

The kingdom of Essex was con quered with equal facility ; and the East-Angles, from their hatred to the Mercian government, which had been establissied over them by treachery and violence, and probably exercised with tyranny, im mediately rose in arms, and craved the protection of Egbert '. Bernulf, the Mercian king, who marched against them, was defeated and slain ; and two years after, Ludican, his successor, met with the same fate. These insurrections and calamities facilitated the enterprises of Egbert, who advanced into the centre of the Mercian territories, and made easy conquests over a dispirited and divided people.

Egbert, however, still allowed to Northumberland, as he had done to Mercia and East-Anglia, the power of electing a king, who paid him tribute, and was dependent on him. Thus were united all the kingdoms of the Hep* tarchy in one great state, near four hundred years after the first arrival of the Saxons in Britain ; and the fortunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert at last effected, what had been so often attempted in vain by so many princes\". Kent, Northumber land, and Mercia, which had successively aspired to general dominion, were now incorporated in his empire ; and the other subordinate kingdoms seem ed willing to ssiare the fame fate.

Th\u00a3 Saxons, though they had been so long fet tled in the island, seem not as yet to have been much improved beyond their German ancestors, either in arts, civility, knowledge, humanity, jus tice, or obedience to the laws.

The reverence towards saints and reliques seems to have almost supplanted the adoration ofthe Supreme Be ing. Monastic observances were esteemed more meritorious than the active virtues : The knowledge of natural causes was neglected from the universal belief of miraculous interpositions and judgments : Bounty to the church atoned for every violence against society : And the remorses for cruelty, mur der, treachery, assassination, and the more robust vices, were appeased, not by amendment of life, but by penances, servility to the monks, and an ab ject and illiberal devotion p. The reverence for the clergy had been carried to such a height, that, wherever a person appeared in a sacerdotal habit, though on the highway, the people flocked around him ; and ssiowing him all marks of profound re spect, received every word he uttered as the most sacred oracle \u25a0\u2022 Even the military virtues, so in herent in all the Saxon tribes, began to be ne glected ; and the nobility, preferring the security and sloth ofthe cloister to the tumults and glory of war, valued themselves chiefly on endowing monasteries, of which they assumed the government '. The se veral kings, too, being extremely impoverissied by continual benefactions to the church, to which the states of their kingdoms had weakly assented, could bestow no rewards on valour or military services, and retained not even sufficient influence to sup port their government '. r* These abuses were common to all the European churches ; but the priests in Italy, Spain, and Gaul made some atonement for them by other advantages which they rendered society. For several ages they were almost all Romans, or, in other words, the ancient natives; and they preserved the Roman language and laws, with some remains of the former civility.

Another inconvenience which attended this corrupt species of Christianity, was the superstitious attachment to Rome, and the gradual subjection of the kingdom to a foreign jurisdiction. The Britons, having never acknowledged any subordination to the Roman pontift\", had conducted all ecclesiastical go vernment by their domestic synods and councils ! : But the Saxons, receiving their religion from Ro man monks, were taught at the fame time a pro found reverence for that see, and were naturally led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pil grimages to Rome were represented as the most meritorious acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of rank undertook this tedious journey u \\ but kings themselves, abdicating their crowns, sought for a secure passport to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New reliques, perpetually sent from that endless mint of superstition, and mag nified by lying miracles invented in convents, ope rated on the astonissied minds of the multitude.

Wilfrid, bishop of LindLferne, the sole prelate ofthe Northumbrian kingdom, increased this subjection in the eighth century, by his making an appeal to Rome against the decisions of an English synod, which had abridged his diocese by the erection of some new bissioprics\".

The great topic by which Wilfrid confounded the imaginations of men was, that St. Peter, to whose custody the keys of heaven were intrusted, would certainly refuse admittance to every one who ssiould be wanting in respect to his successor. This conceit, well suited to vulgar conceptions, made great impression on the people during several ages ; and has not even at present lost all influence in the catholic countries. .Had this abject superstition produced general peace and tranquillity, it had made some atonement for the ills attending it ; but besides the usual avi dity of men for power and riches, frivolous contro versies in theology were engendered by it, . which were so much the more fatal, as they admitted not like the others, of any final determination from establissied possession. The disputes excited in Britain were of the most ridiculous kind, and en tirely worthy of those ignorant and barbarous ages. There were some intricacies, observed by all the Christian churches, in adjusting the day of keeping Easter ; which depended on a complicated consider ation of the course of the fun and moon: And it happened that the missionaries, who I^d converted the Scots and Britons, had followed a different ca lendar from that which was observed at Rome in the age when Augustine converged the Saxons. The priests also of all the Christian churches were ac customed tossiavepart of their head; but the for/n Jsiven to this tonlure was different in the former fom what was practised in the latter. The Scots and Britons pleaded the antiquity of their usages.: The Romans, and their disciples, the Saxons, in- * Eddius vitaVilfr. $24.-60. sisted"], [90, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 64 CHAP, 1. sifted on the universality of theirs. That Eastef must necessarily be kept by a rule, which compre hended both the day of the year and age of the moon, was agreed by all ; that the tonsure of a priest could not be omitted without the utmost im piety, was a point undisputed : But the Romans and Saxons called their antagonists schismatics ; be cause they celebrated Easter on the very day of the full moon in March, if that day fell on a Sunday, instead of waiting till the Sunday following ; and \u2022because they ssiaved the fore-part of their head from ear to ear, instead of making that tonsure on the crown of the head, and in a circular form. In or der to render their antagonists odious, they affirmed that once in seven years they concurred with the Jews in the time of celebrating that festival y : And that they might recommend their own form of ton sure, they maintained, that it imitated symbolically the crown of thorns worn by Christ in his passion ; whereas the other form was invented by Simon Magus, without any regard to that representation z. These controversies had, from the beginning, ex cited such animosity between the British and Romissi priests, that, instead of concurring in their endea vours to convert the idolatrous Saxons, they refused all communion together, and each regarded his op ponent as no better than a Pagan \\ The dispute lasted more than a century ; and was at last finished, not by men's discovering the folly of it, which would have been too great an effort for human rea son to accomplissi, but by the entire prevalence of the Romissi ritual over the Scotch and British -b.

Their language was every where nearly the fame, their cus toms, laws, institutions civil and religious ; and as the race of the ancient kings was totally extinct in ail the subjected states, the people readily transferred their allegiance to a prince, who seemed to merit ir, by the splendour of his victories, the vigour of his administration, and the superior nobility of his birth. A union also in government opened to them the agreeable prospect of future tranquillity ; and it ap peared more probable that they would henceforth become formidable to their neighbours, than be ex posed to their inroads and devastations. But these flattering views were scon overcast by the appear ance of the Danes, who, during some centuries, kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquietude, committed the most barbarous ravages upon them, and at last reduced them to grievous servitude. The emperor Charlemagne, though naturally ge nerous and humane, had been induced by bigotry to exercise great severities upon the Pagan Saxons in Germany, whom he subdued ; and besides often ra- vaging"], [93, "*7 CHAP ii EGBERT vaging their country with fire and sword, he had in ' cool blood decimated all the inhabitants for their re- , volts, and had obliged them, by the most rigorous edicts, to make a seeming compliance with the Christian doctrine. That religion, which had easily made its wav among the British Saxons by insinua tion and address, appeared ssiocking to their German brethren, when imposed on them by the violence of Charlemagne ; and the more generous and warlike of these Pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to escape the fury of his persecutions. Meet ing there with a people of similar manners, they were' readily received among them; and they soon stimu lated the natives to concur in enterprises, which both promised revenge on the haughty conqueror, and afforded subsistence to those numerous inhabit ants with which the northern countries were now overburdened s. They invaded the provinces of France, which were exposed by the degeneracy and dissensions of Charlemagne's posterity ; and being there known under the general name of Normans, which they received from their northern situation, they became the terror of all the maritime and even of the inland countries. They were also tempted to visit England in their frequent excursions; and being able, by sudden inroads, to make great progress over a people who were not defended by any naval force, who had relaxed their military institutions, and who were funk into a superstition which had become odious to the Danes and ancient Saxons, they made no distinction in their hostilities between the French and Englissi kingdoms. Their first ap pearance in this island was in the year 787 '', when Brithric reigned in Wessex. A small body of them landed in that kingdom, with a view of learning the state ofthe country ; and when the magistrate of the place questioned them concerning their enter- * Ypod.

The next alarm was given to Nor thumberland in the year 794'; when a body of these pirates pillaged a monastery ; but their ships being much damaged by a storm, and their leader slain in a ssiirmissi, they were at last defeated by the inhabitants, and the remainder of them put to the sword. Five years after Egbert had establissied his monarchy over England, the Danes landed in the Isle of Shepey, and having pillaged it, escaped with impunity k. They were not so fortunate in their next year's enterprise, when they disembarked from thirty-five ships, and were encountered by Egbert, at Charmouth in Dorsetssiire. The battle was bloody ; but though the Danes lost great numbers, they maintained the post which they had taken, and thence made good their retreat to their ssiips1. Having learned by experience, that they must ex pect a vigorous resistance from this warlike prince, they entered into an alliance with the Britons of Cornwal ; and landing two ye trs after in that coun try, made an inroad with their confederates into the county of Devon ; but were met at Hengesdown by Egbert, and totally defeated m. While England remained in this state of anxiety, and defended it self more by temporary expedients than by any re gular plan of administration, Egbert, who alone was able to provide effectually against this new evil, unfortunately died4; and left the government to his son Ethelwolf. \u00ab Chron.

Encouraged by these suc cesses, and by the superiority which they had ac quired in arms, they now ventured, under the command of Hinguar and Hubba, to leave the sea coast, and penetrating into Mercia, they took up their winter-quarters at Nottingham, where they threatened the kingdom with a final subjection. TheMercians,in this extremity, applied to Ethered for succour ; and that prince, with his brother Al fred, conducting a great army to Nottingham, ob liged the enemy to dislodge, and to retreat into Nor- 87\u00ab thumberland. Their restless disposition, and their avidity for plunder, allowed them not to remain long in those quarters : They broke into East- Anglia, defeated and took prisoner Edmund, the king of that country, whom they afterwards murdered in cool blood ; and committing the most barbarous ra vages on the people, particularly on the monasteries, they gave the East- Angles cause to regret the tem porary relief which they had obtained, by assisting the common enemy. The next station of the Danes was at Reading; \u00ab71, whence they infested the neighbouring country by their incursions. The Mercians, desirous of ssiak ing off their dependence on Ethered, refused to join him with their forces ; and that prince, at tended by Alfred, was obliged to march against the enemy, with the West-Saxons alone, his hereditary subjects. The Danes, being defeated in an action, ftut themselves up in their garrison; but quickly making thence an irruption, they routed the West. Saxon's, and obliged them to raise the siege.

Alfred advancing with one division of the army, was surrounded by the enemy in disadvantageous ground ; and Ethered, who was at that time hearing mass, refused to march to his assistance till prayers ssiould be finissied s : But as he afterwards obtained the victory, this suc cess, not the danger of Alfred, was ascribed by the monks to the piety of that monarch. This battle of Aston did not terminate thewar : Another battle was a little after fought at Basing ; where the Danes were more successful ; and being reinforced by a new army from their own country, they became every day more terrible to the Englissi. Amidst these confusions, Ethered died of a wound which he had received in an action with the Danes; and left the inheritance of his cares and misfortunes, rather than of his grandeur, to his brother, Alfred, who was now twenty-two years of age.

His genius was first roused by the recital of Saxon poems, in which the queen took delight; and this species of eru dition, which is sometimes able to make a consider able progress even among barbarians, expanded those noble and elevated sentiments which he had received from nature'. Encouraged by the queen, and stimulated by his own ardent inclination, he soon learned to read those compositions ; and pro ceeded thence to acquire the knowledge of the Latin tongue, in which he met with authors that better prompted his heroic spirit, and directed his generous views. Absorbed in these elegant pur suits, he regarded his accession to royalty rather as an object of regret than of triumph\"; but being called to the throne, in preference to his brother's children, as well by the will of his father, a cir cumstance which had great authority with the Anglo-Saxons ', as by the vows of the whole na tion, and the urgency of public affairs, he ssiook off his literary indolence, and exerted himself in the defence of his people. He had scarcely buried his brother, when he was obliged to take the field, in order to oppose the Danes, who had seized Wil ton, and were exercising their usual ravages on the countries around. He marched against them with the few troops which he could assemble on a sud den ; and giving them battle, gained at first an advantage, but by his pursuing the victory too far, the superiority of the enemy's numbers prevailed, and recovered them the day.

For that purpose they were conducted to London, and allowed to take up winter-quarters there ; bur, careless of their engagements, they immediately set themselves to the committing of spoil on the neigh bouring country. Burrhed, king of Mercia, in. whose territories, London was situated, made a new, stipulation with them, and engaged them, by pre sents, of money, to remove to Lindesey, in Lincoln ssiire ; a country which they had already reduced to ruin .and desolation, Finding therefore no object in that place, either for their rapine or violence, they suddenly turned back upon Mercia, in a quarter where they expected to find it without defence ; and fixing their station at Repton, in Derbyssiire, they laid the whole country desolate with fire and sword.

A new swarm of Danes came over this year under three princes, Guthrum, Oscita!., and Amund; and having first joined their countrymen at Repton, they soon found the ne cessity of separating, in order to provide for their subsistence.

That prince so straightened them in these quarters, that they were content to come to a treaty with him, and stipulated to depart his country. Alfred, well acquainted with their usual perfidy, obliged them to swear upon the holy reliques to the observance of the treaty \".; not that he expected they would pay any veneration to the reliques; but he hoped, that, if they now violated this oath, their impiety would infallibly draw down upon them the vengeance of Heaven. But the Danes, little apprehensive of the danger, suddenly, without seeking any pretence, fell upon Alfred's army ; and having put it to route, marched west- ward, and took possession of Exeter. The prince collected new forces, and exerted such vigour, that he fought in one year eight battles with the enemyp, and reduced them to the utmost extremity. He hearkened however to new proposals of peace ; and was satisfied to .stipulate with them, that they would settle somewhere in England q, and would not per- mit the entrance of more ravagers into the king- dom. But while he was expecting the execution of this treaty, which it seemed the interest of the Danes themselves to fulfil, he heard that another body had landed, and having collected all the scattered troops of their countrymen, had surprised Chippenham, then a considerable town, and were exercising their usual ravages all around them. This last incident quite broke the spirit of the Saxons, and reduced them to despair.

Some left their country, and retired into 'Wales, or fled beyond sea : Others submitted to the conquerors, in hopes of appeasing their fury by a servile obe dience '. And every man's attention being now en grossed in concern for his own preservation, no one would hearken to the exhortations of the king, who summoned them to make under his conduct one effort more in defence of their prince, their coun try, and their liberties. Alfred himself was ob liged to relinquissi the ensigns of his dignity, to dismiss his servants, and to seek ssielter, in the meanest disguises, from the pursuit and fury of his enemies. He concealed himself under a peasant's habit, and lived some time in the house of a neat herd, who had been entrusted with the care of some of his cows '. There passed here an incident, which has been recorded by all the historians, and was long preserved by popular tradition; though it contains nothing memorable in itself, except so far as every circumstance is interesting, which attends so much virtue and dignity reduced to such difc tress. The wise ofthe neat-herd was ignorant of the condition of her royal guest ; and observing him one day busy by the fire-side, in trimming his bow and arrows, ssie desired him to take care of iome cakes which were toasting, while ssie was em ployed elsewhere in other domestic affairs. But Alfred, whose thoughts were otherwise engaged, neglected this injunction ; and the good woman, on her return, finding her cakes all burnt, rated the king very severely, and upbraided him, that he al ways seemed very well pleased to eat her warm cakes, though he was thus negligent in toasting them1. r Chron.

He here found two acres of firm ground ; and building a habitation on them, rendered himself secure by its fortifications, and still more by the unknown and inaccessible roads which led to it, and by the forests and morasses with which it was every way environed. This place he called \u00c6thelingay, or the Isle of Nobles u ; and it now bears the name of Athelney.

Alfred lay here concealed, but not unactive, during a twelvemonth ; when the news of a pro sperous event reached his ears, and called him to the field. Hubba, the Dane, having spread de vastation, fire, and slaughter, over Wales, had land ed in Devonshire from twenty-three vessels, and laid siege to the castle of Kmwith, a place situated near the mouth of the small river Tau. Oddune, earl ot Devonshire, with his followers, had taken ssielter there ; and being ill supplied with provisions, and even with water, he determined, by some vi gorous blow, to prevent the necessity of submitting to the barbarous enemy.

It contained the figure of a raven, which had been inwoven by the three sisters of Hinguar and Hubba with many magical incantations, and which, by its different movements, prognosticated, as the Danes believed, the good or bad success of any enterprise x. When Alfred observed this symptom of suc cessful resistance in his subjects, he left his retreat ; but before he would assemble them in arms, or urge them to any attempt, which, if unfortunate, might, in their present despondency, prove fatal, heresclved to inspect, himself, the situation ofthe enemy, and to judge of the probability of success. F'or this purpose he entered their camp under the disguise of a harper, and passed unsuspected through every quarter. He so entertained them with his music and facetious humours, that he met with a welcome reception ; and was even introduced to the tent of Guthrum, their prince, where he remained some days y. He remarked the supine security of the Danes, their contempt of the Englissi, their negligence in foraging and plundering, and their dissolute wasting of what they gained by rapine and violence. Encouraged by these favourable appear ances, he secretly sent emissaries to the most con siderable of his subjects, and summoned them to a rendezvous, attended by their warlike followers, at Brixton, on the borders of Selwood forest z. The Englissi, who had hoped to put an end to their ca lamities by servile submission, now found the inso lence and rapine of the conqueror more intolerable than all past fatigues and dangers ; and at the ap pointed day, they joyfully resorted to their prince.

The success of this expedient seemed to corre spond to Alfred's hopes : The greater part of the Danes settled peaceably in their new quarters : Some smaller bodies of the fame nation, which were dis persed in Mercia, were distributed into the five cities of Derby, Leicester, Stamford, Lincoln, and Nottingham, and were thence called the Fif or Five burghers.

The king employed this interval of tranquillity in restoring order to the state, which had been shaken by so many violent convulsions ; in esta blishing civil and military institutions ; in compos ing the minds of men to industry and justice; and in providing against the return of like calamities. He was, more properly than his grandfather Egbert, the sole monarch of the English (for so the Saxons were now universally called), because the kingdom of Mercia was at last incorporated in his state, and was governed by Ethelbert his brother-in-law, who bore the title of, Earl : And though the Danes, who peopled East-Anglia and Northumberland, were for some time ruled immediately by their own princes, they all acknowledged a subordination to Alfred, k Chron.

As equa- chap. lity among subjects is the great source of concord, \u25a0_ / _\u25a0 Alfred gave the same laws to the Danes and Eng glifh, and put them entirely on a like footing in the administration both of civil and criminal justice. The fine for the murder of a Dane was the fame with that for the murder of an Englishman ; the r great symbol of equality in those ages. The king, after rebuilding the ruined cities, par ticularly London', which had been destroyed by the Danes in the reign of Ethelwolf, established a regular militia for the defence of the kingdom. He ordained that all his people should be armed and registered ; he assigned them a regular rotation of duty ; he distributed part into the castles and for tresses, which he built at proper places g; he re quired another part to take the field on any alarm, and, to assemble at stated places of rendezvous ; and he left a sufficient number at home, who were em ployed in the cultivation of the land, and who af terwards took their turn in military service \\ The whole kingdom was like one great garrison ; and the Danes could no sooner appear in one place, than a sufficient number was assembled to oppose them, without leaving the other quarters defenceless or disarmed j.

He distributed his armed vessels in proper stations round the island, and was sure to meet the Danish ships either before or after they had landed their troops, and to pursue them in all their incursions. Though the Danes might suddenly, by surprise, disembark on the coast, which was generally become desolate by their frequent ravages, they were encountered by the English fleet in their retre:-* ; and escaped not, as formerly, by abandoning their booty, but paid, by their total destruction, the penalty of the disorders which they had committed. In this manner Alfred repelled several inroads of these piratical Danes, and maintained his kingdom, during seme years, in safety and tranquillity. A fleet of a hundred and twenty stiips of war was sta tioned upon the coast ; and being provided with warlike engines, as well as with expert seamen, both Frisians and English (for Alfred supplied the de fects of his own subjects by engaging able foreigners in his service), maintained a superiority over those smaller bands, with which England had so often been infested '. But at last Hastings, the famous Danisli chief, having ravaged all the provinces of France, both along the sea-coast and the Loire and Seine, and being obliged to quit that country, more by the desolation which he himself had occasioned, than by the resistance of the inhabitants, appeared off the coast of Kent with a fleet of 330 fail. The greater part of the enemy disembarked in the Ro ther, and seized the fort of Apuldore. Hastings himself, commanding a fleet of eighty sail, entered the Thames, and fortifying Milton in Kent, began to spread his forces over the country, and to commit the most destructive ravages. But Alfred, on the first alarm of this descent, flew to the defence of his people, at the head of a select band of soldiers, 1 Aster, p. 11. Chron. Sax. p. 86, 87. M.

Tired of this situation, which must in the end prove ruinous to them, the Danes at Apuldore rose suddenly from their encamp ment, with an inrention of marching towards the Thames, and pasting over into Essex : But they escaped not the vigilance of Alfred, who encoun tered them at Farnham, put them to rout \u00b0, seized all their horses and baggage, and chased the run aways on board their ships, which carried them up the Colne to Mersey in Essex, where they entrench ed themselves.

The East-Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, on the first appearance of Alfred upon their fron tiers, made anew the most humble submissions to him ; and he thought it prudent to take them under his immediate government, without establishing over them a viceroy of their own nation a. The Welsh also acknowledged his authority ; and this great prince had now, by prudence, and justice, and va lour, established his sovereignty over all the south ern parts of the island, from the English channel to the frontiers of Scotland ; when he died, in the vi gour of his age and the full strength of his faculties, after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years and a half b ; in which he deservedly attained the appella tion of Alfred the Great, and the title of Founder of the English monarchy. The merit of this prince, both in private and public life, may with advantage be set in opposition to that of any monarch or citizen which the annals of any age or any nation can present to us.

His civil and military virtues are almost equally the objects of our admiration ; excepting only, that the former, being more rare among princes, as well as more useful, seem chiefly to challenge our applause. Nature also, as if desir ous that so bright a production of her skill should be set in the fairest light, had bestowed on him every bodily accomplishment, vigour of limbs, dignity of shape and air, with a pleasing, engaging, and open countenance d. Fortune alone, by throwing him into that barbarous age, deprived him of historians worthy to transmit his fame to posterity ; and we wish to see him delineated in more lively colours, and with more particular strokes, that we may at least perceive seme of those small specks and ble mishes, from which, as a man, it is impossible he could be entirely exempted. But we should give but an imperfect idea of Alfred's merit, were we to confine our narration to his military exploits, and were not more particular in our account of his institutions for the execution of justice, and of his zeal for the encouragement of arts and sciences. After Alfred had subdued, and had settled or expelled the Danes, he found the kingdom in the most wretched condition ; desolated by the ravages of those barbarians, and thrown into disorders, which were calculated to perpetuate its misery. Though the great armies of the Danes were broken, the country was full of straggling troops of that nation, who, being accustomed to live by plunder, were become incapable of industry ; and who, from the natural ferocity of their manners, indulged them selves in committing violence, even beyond what was requisite to supply their necessities.

These were the evils for which it was ne cessary that the vigilance and activity of Alfred should provide a remedy. That he might render the execution of justice strict and regular, he divided all England into coun ties ; these counties he subdivided into hundreds ; and the hundreds into tithings Everv householder was answerable for the behaviour of his family and slaves, and even of his guests, if they lived above three days in his house. Ten neighbouring house holders were formed into one corporation, who, un der the name of a tithing, decennary, or fribourg, were answerable for each other's conduct, and over whom one person, called a tithingman, headbourg, or borsholder, was appointed to preside. Every man was punished as an outlaw who did not register himself in some tithing. And no man could change his habitation, without a warrant or certificate from the borsholder of the tithing to which he formerly belonged. When any person in any tithing or decennary was guilty of a crime, the borsholder was summoned to answer for him ; and if he were not willing to be surety for his appearance, and his clearing himself, the criminal was committed to prison, and there detained till his trial. If he fled, either before or after finding sureties, the borsholder and decen nary became liable to enquiry, and were exposed to the penalties of law. Thirty-one days were allowed them for producing the criminal ; and if the time elapsed without their being able to find him, the borsholder, with two other members el"], [119, "ALFRED 93 CHAP, II of the decennary, was obliged to appear, and, to gether with three chief members of the three neigh bouring decennaries (making twelve in all), to swear that his decennary was free from all privity both of the crime committed, and of the escape of the cri minal. If the borsholder could not find such a num ber to answer for their innocence, the decennary was compelled by fine to make satisfaction to the king, according to the degree of the offence f. By this institution every man was obliged from his own interest to keep a watchful eye over the conduct of his neighbours ; and was in a manner surety for the behaviour of those who were placed under the di vision to which he belonged : Whence these de cennaries received the name of frank-pledges. Such a regular distribution of the people, with such a strict confinement in their habitation, may not be necessary in times when men are more enured to obedience and justice; and it might perhaps be regarded as destructive of liberty and commerce in a polished state ; but it was well calculated to reduce that fierce and licentious people under the salutary restraint of law and government. But Alfred took care to temper these rigours by other institutions favourable to the freedom of the citizens ; and no thing could be more popular and liberal than his plan for the administration of justice. The bor sholder summoned together his whole decennary to assist him in deciding any lesser difference which occurred among the -members of this small com munity. In affairs of greater moment, in appeals from the decennary, or in controversies arising be tween members of different decennaries, the cause was brought before the hundred, which consisted of ten decennaries, or a hundred families of freemen, and which was regularly assembled once in four weeks for the deciding of causes8.

Twelve freeholders were chosen; who, having sworn, together with the hun dreder, or presiding magistrate of that division, to administer impartial justice h, proceeded to the ex amination of that cause which was submitted to their jurisdiction. And beside these monthly meet ings of the hundred, there was an annual meeting, appointed for a more general inspection of the po lice of the district ; for the enquiry into crimes, the correction of abuses in magistrates, and the obliging of every person to shew the decennary in which he was registered. The people, in imitation of their ancestors, the ancient Germans, assembled there in arms ; whence a hundred was sometimes called a wapentake, and its courts served both for the sup port of military discipline, and for the administra tion of civil justice *. The next superior court to that of the hundred \u25a0was the county-court, which met twice a year, after Michaelmas and Easter, and consisted of the free holders of the county, who possessed an equal vote in the decision of causes. The bishop presided in this court, together with the alderman ; and the proper object of the court was the receiving of ap peals from the hundreds and decennaries, and the deciding of such controversies as arose between men of different hundreds. Formerly, the alderman possessed both the civil and military authority ; but Alfred, sensible that this conjunction of powers ren dered the nobility dangerous and independent, ap pointed also a slieriff in each county, who enjoyed a co-ordinate authority with the former in the judicial h Fcedus Alfred, and Gothurn, apud Wilkins, cap. 3. p. 47.

His office also impowered him to guard the rights of the crown in the county, and to levy the fines imposed ; which in that age formed no contemptible part of the public revenue. There lay an appeal, in default of justice, from all these courts to the king himself in council ; and as the people, sensible of the equity and great talents of Alfred, placed their chief confidence in him, he was soon overwhelmed with appeals from all parts of England. He was indefatigable in the dispatch of these causes 1 ; but finding that his time must be entirely engrossed by this braich of duty, he re- solved to obviate the ic t \\.nience, by correcting the ignorance or corruption of the inferior magis- trates, from which it arose m.

The better to guide the magistrates in the admi- nistration of justice, Alfred framed a body of laws ; which, though now lost, served long as the basis of English jurilprudence, and is generally deemed the origin of what is denominated the common law.

But, on the whole, such success at tended his legislation, that every thing bore sud denly a new face in England : Robberies and ini quities of all kinds were repressed by the punish ment or reformation of the criminals r : And so exact was the general police, that Alfred, it is said, hung up, by way of bravado, golden bracelets near the highways ; and. no man dared to touch them \\ Yet, amidst these rigours of justice, this great prince preserved the most sacred regard to the liberty of his people ; and it is a memorable sentiment pre served in his will, that it was Just the Englisti should for ever remain as free as their own thoughts '. As good morals and knowledge are almost inse parable, in every age, though not in every indivi dual ; the care of Alfred for the encouragement of learning among his subjects, was another useful branch of his legislation, and tended to reclaim the English from their former dissolute and ferocious manners : But the king was guided in this pursuit, less by political views, than by his natural bent and propensity towards letters. When he came to the throne, he found the nation funk into the grossest ignorance and barbarism, proceeding from the con tinued disorders in the government, and from the ravages of the Danes : The monasteries were de stroyed, the monks butchered or dispersed, their libraries burnt ; and thus the only scats of erudition in those ages were totally subverted.

But the most effectual expedient, employed by Alfred, for the encouragement of learning, was his own example, and the constant assiduity with which, notwithstanding the multiplicity and urgency of his affairs, he employed himself in the pursuits of knowledge. He usually divided his time into three equal portions : One was employed in sleep, and the refection of his body by diet and exercise ; an other in the dispatch of business; a third in study and devotion ; and that he might more exactly mea sure the hours, he made use of burning tapers of equal length, which he fixed in lanthorns w ; an ex pedient suited to that rude age, when the geometry of dialling, and the mechanism of clocks and watches, were totally unknown.

But when the king approached the town with a great army, Ethelwald, having the prospect of certain destruction, made his escape, and fled first into Normandy, then into Northumber land ; where he hoped that the people who had been recently subdued by Alfred, and who were impatient of peace, would on the intelligence of that great prince's death, seize the first pretence or opportunity of rebellion. The event did not disappoint his ex pectations: The Northumbrians declared for himk ; and Ethelwald having thus connected his interests with the Danish tribes, went beyond sea, and col lecting a body of these freebooters, he excited the hopes of all those who had been accustomed to sub sist by rapine and violence '. The East- Anglian Danes joined his party : The Five-burgers, who were seated in the heart of Mercia, began to put themselves in motion ; and the English found that they were again menaced with those convulsions, from which the valour and policy of Alfred had so lately rescued them. The rebels, headed by Ethel wald, made an incursion into the counties of Gio cester, Oxford, and Wilts ; and having exercised their ravages in these places, they retired with their booty, before the king, who had assembled an army, was able to approach them.

This dis obedience proved in the issue fortunate to Edward. The Danes assaulted the Kentish men ; but met with so vigorous a resistance, that, though they gained the field of battle, they bought that advan tage by the loss of their bravest leaders, and among the rest, by that of Ethelwald, who perislied in the action m. The king, freed from the fear of so dan gerous a competitor, made peace on advantageous terms with the East-Angles n. In order to restore England to such a state of tranquillity as it was then capable of attaining, nought was wanting but the subjection of the Nor thumbrians, who, assisted by the scattered Danes in Mercia, continually infested the bowels of the king dom. Edward, in order to divert the force of these enemies, prepared a fleet to attack them by sea ; hoping that when his ships appeared on their coast, they must at least remain at home, and provide for their defence. But the Northumbrians were less anxious to secure their own property, than greedy to commit spoil on their enemy ; and concluding, that the chief strength of the English was embarked on board the fleet, they thought the opportunity fa vourable, and entered Edward's territories with all their forces. The king, who was prepared against this event, attacked them on their return at Teten hall in the county of Stafford, put them to rout, re covered all the booty, and pursued them with great slaughter into their own country.

He vanquished Thurke till, a great Danish chief, and obliged him to retire with his followers into France, in quest of spoil and adventures. He subdued the East-Angles, and forced them to swear allegiance to him : He ex pelled the two rival princes of Northumberland, Reginald and Sidroc, and acquired, for the present, the dominions of that province : Several tribes of the Britons were subjected by him ; and even the Scots, who, during the reign of Egbert, had, un der the conduct of Kenneth, their king, increased their power by the final subjection of the Picts, were nevertheless obliged to give him marks of submis sion p.

The king accepted of the condition, and Alfred was conducted to Rome ; where, either con scious of his innocence, or neglecting the supersti tion to which he appealed, he ventured to make the oath required of him, before John, who then silled the papal chair.

He marched into Northumberland ; and finding that the inhabitants bore with impatience the English yoke, he thought it prudent to confer on Sithric, a Danish nobleman, the title of King, and to attach him to his interests, by giving him his sister, Editha, in marriage. But this policy proved by accident the source of dangerous consequences. Sithric died in a twelvemonth after ; and his two sons by a for mer marriage, Anlaf and Godfrid, founding pre tensions on their father's elevation, assumed the so vereignty without waiting for Athelstan's consent. They were soon expelled by the power of that mo narch ; and the former took shelter in Ireland, as the latter did in Scotland ; where he received, dur ing some time, protection from Constantine, who then enjoyed the crown of that kingdom.

The English historians assert x, that Constantine did homage to Athelstan for his kingdom ; and they add, that the latter prince, being urged by his courtiers to push the present fa vourable opportunity, and entirely subdue Scotland, replied, that it was more glorious to confer than conquer kingdoms y. But those annals, so uncer tain and imperfect in themselves, lose all credit, when national prepossessions and animosities have place : And on that account, the Scotch historians, who, without having any nioie knowledge of the matter, strenuously deny the fact, seem more worthy of belief. Constantine, whether he owed the retaining of his crown to the moderation of Athelstan, who was unwilling to employ all his advantages against him, or to the palicy of that prince, who esteemed the humiliation of an enemy a greater acquisition than the subjection of a discontented and mutinous peo ple, thought the behaviour of the English monarch more an object of resentment than of gratitude. He entered into a confederacy with Anlaf, who had collected a great body of Danisli pirates, whom he found hovering in the Iriih seas ; and with some Welsh princes, who were terrified at the growing power of Athelstan : And all these allies made by concert an irruption with a great army into Eng land. Athelstan, collecting his forces, met the enemy near Brunlbury in Northumberland, and de feated them in a general engagement.

There is a circumstance not unworthy of no tice, which historians relate, with regard to the trans actions of this war. Anlaf, on the approach of the English army, thought that he could not venture too much to ensure a fortunate event ; and employing the artifice formerly practised by Alfred against the Danes, he entered the enemy's camp in the habit cf a minstre1. The stratagem was for the present attended with like success. He gave such satis faction to the soldiers, who flocked about him, that they introduced him to the king's tent ; and Anlaf, having played before that prince and his nobles during their repast, was dismissed with a handsome reward. His prudence kept him from refusing the present ; but his pride determined him, on his de parture, to bury it, while he fancied that he was unespied by all the world. But a soldier in Athel stan's camp, who had formerly served under Anlaf, had been struck with some suspicion on the first ap pearance of the minstrel ; and was engaged by cu riosity to observe all his motions. He regarded this last action as a full proof of Anlaf's disguise ; and he immediately carried the intelligence to Athelstan, who blamed him for not sooner giving him inform ation, that he might have seized his enemy. But the soldier told him, that, as he had formerly sworn fealty to Anlaf, he could never have pardoned him self the treachery of betraying and ruining his an cient master ; and that Athelstan himself, after such an instance of his criminal conduct, would have had equal reason to distrust his allegiance. Athelstan, having praised the generosity of the soldier's prin ciples, reflected on the incident, which he foresaw might be attended with important consequences.

The precaution of Athelstan was found prudent : For no sooner had darkness fallen, than Anlaf broke into the camp, and hasten ing directly to the place where he had left the king's tent, put the bishop to death before he had time to prepare for his defence \\ There fell several Danish and Welsh princes in the action of Brunsbury b ; and Constantine and Anlaf made their escape with difficulty, leaving the greater part of their army on the field of battle. After this success, Athelstan enjoyed his crown in tranquillity ; and he is regarded as one of the ablest and most active of those ancient princes. He passed a remarkable law, which was calculated for the encouragement of commerce, and which it re quired some liberality of mind in that age to have devised : That a merchant, who had made three long sea-voyages on his own account, should be ad mitted to the rank of a thane or gentleman.

Fie also conquered Cum berland from the Britons ; and conferred that ter ritory on Malcolm king of Scotland, on condition that he sttould do him homage for it, and protect the north from all future incursions of the Danes. Edmund was young when he came to the crown; yet was his reign short, as his death was violent.

Enraged at this insolence, he ordered him to leave the room ; but on his refusing to obey, the king, whose temper, naturally choleric, was in flamed by this additional insult, leaped on him him self, and seised him by the hair : But the ruffian, pushed to extremity, drew his dagger, and gave Edmund a wound, of which he immediately ex pired. This event happened in the year 946, and in the sixth year of the king's reign. Edmund left male issue, but so young, that they were incapable of governing the kingdom ; and his brother, Ed\u00ab red, was promoted to the throne. E D R E D. rr>FIE reign of this prince, as those of his pre- decessors, was disturbed by the rebellions and incursions of the Northumbrian Danes, who, though frequently quelled, were never entirely subdued, 5 nor"], [135, "IOg CHAP, II E D R E D. nor had ever paid a sincere allegiance to the crown of F'.ngland. The accession of a new king seemed to them a favourable opportunity for shaking off the yoke; but on Edred's appearance with an army, they made him their wonted submissions ; and the king having wasted the country with fire and sword, as a punishment of their rebellion, obliged them to renew their oath of allegiance; and he straight retired with his forces. The obedience of the Danes lasted no longer than the present terror. Provoked at the devastations of Edred, and even reduced by necessity to subsist on plunder, they broke into a new rebellion, and were again sub dued : But the king, now instructed by experience, took great precautions against their future revolt. He fixed English garrisons in their most consider able towns ; and placed over them an English go vernor, who might watch all their motions, and suppress any insurrection on its first appearance. He obliged also Malcolm, king of Scotland, to re new his homage for the lands which he held in England. Edred, though not unwarlike, nor unfit for active life, lay under the influence of the lowest su perstition, and had blindly delivered over his con science to the guidance of Dunstan, commonly called St. Dunstan, abbot of Glastenbury, whom he advanced to the highest offices, and who co vered, under the appearance of sanctity, the molt violent and most insolent ambition. Taking ad vantage of the implicit confidence reposed in him by the king, this churchman imported into Eng land a new order of monks, who much changed the state of ecclesiastical affairs, and excited, on their first establishment, the most violent commotions. FRom the introduction of Christianity among the Saxons, there had been monasteries in England ; and these establishments had extremely multiplied, by the donations of the princes and nobles ; whose supersti-"], [136, "JIO CHAP II HISTORY OF ENGLAND. superstition, derived from their ignorance and pre carious life, and increased by remorses for the crimes into which they were so frequently betrayed, knew no ether expedient for appeasing the Deity than a profuse liberality towards the ecclesiastics. But the monks had hitherto been a species of secu lar priests, who lived after the manner of the present canons or prebendaries, and were both intermingled in some degree with the world, and endeavoured to render themselves useful to it. They were em ployed in the education of youth e : They had the disposal of their own time and industry : They were not subjected to the rigid rules of an order : They had made no vows of implicit obedience to their superiors f : And they still retained the choice, with out quitting the convent, either of a married or a single life s. But a mistaken piety had produced in Italy a new species of monks called Benedictines ; who, carrying farther the plausible principles of mortification, secluded themselves entirely from the world, renounced all claim to liberty, and made a merit of the most inviolable chastity. These prac tices and principles, which superstition at first en gendered, were greedily embraced and promoted by the policy of the court of Rome. The Roman pontiff, who was making every day great advances towards an absolute sovereignty over the eccle siastics, perceived that the celibacy of the clergy alone could break off entirely their connexion with the civil power, and depriving them of every other object of ambition, engage them to promote, with unceasing industry, the grandeur of their own order. He was sensible, that so long as the monks were in dulged in marriage, and were permitted to rear fa milies, they never could be subjected to strict dis cipline, or reduced to that slavery under their e Cfberne in Anglia Sacra, torn. 2. p. 92. f Olberne, p. 91- 8 See Wharto'n's notes to Anglia Sacra, torn. 2. p. 91.

Celibacy, therefore, began to be ex tolled, as the indispensable duty of priests ; and the pope undertook to make all the clergy throughout the western world renounce at once the privilege of marriage : A fortunate policy ; but at the fame time an undertaking the most difficult of any, since he had the strongest propensities of human nature to encounter, and found, that the fame connexions with the female sex, which generally encourage de votion, were here unfavourable to the success of his project. It is no wonder, therefore, that this mas ter-stroke of art should have met with violent con tradiction, and that the interests of the hierarchy, and the inclinations of the priests, being now placed in this singular opposition, should, notwithstanding the continued efforts of Rome, have retarded the execution of that bold scheme during the course of near three centuries. As the bisliops and parochial clergy lived apart with their families, and were more connected with the world, the hopes of success with them were fainter ; and the pretence for making them renounce marriage was much less plausible. But the pope, having cast his eye on the monks as the basis of his authority, was determined to reduce them under strict rules of obedience, to procure them the credit of sanctity by an appearance of the most rigid mor tification, and to break off all their other ties which might interfere with his spiritual policy. Under pretence, therefore, of reforming abuses, which were, in some degree, unavoidable in the ancient establishments, he had already spread over the southern countries of Europe the severe laws of the monastic life, and began to form attempts towards a like innovation in England.

Dunstan was born of noble parents in fhe west of England ; and being educated under his uncle Aldhelm, then archbishop of Canterbury, had be taken himself to the ecclesiastical life, and had ac quired some character in the court of Edmund. He was, however, represented to that prince as a man of licentious manners h : And finding his for tune blasted by these suspicions, his ardent ambition prompted him to repair his indiscretions, by run ning into an opposite extreme. He secluded him self entirely from the world; he framed a cell so small, that he could neither stand erect in it, nor stretch out his limbs during his repose;, and he here employed himself perpetually either in devotion or in manual labour '. It is probable, that his brain became gradually crazed by these solitary occupa tions, and that his head was filled with chimeras, which being believed by himself and his stupid vo taries, procured him the general character of sanctity among the people. He fancied that the devil, among- the frequent visits which he paid him, was one day more earnest than usual in his tempta tions ; till Dunstan, provoked at his importunity, seized him by the nose with a pair of red-hot pin cers, as he put his head into the cell ; and he held him there, till that malignant spirit made the whole neighbourhood resound with his bellowings. This notable exploit was seriously credited and extolled by the public ; it is transmitted to posterity by one who, considering the age. in which he lived, may pass for a writer of some elegance k ; and it ensured to Dunstan a -reputation which no real piety, much less virtue, could, even in the most enlightened pe riod, have ever procured him with the people.

He was placed at the head of the treasury ', and being thus possessed both of power at court, and of credit with the populace, he was enabled to at tempt with success the most arduous enterprises. Finding that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of his austerity, he professed himself a partizan of the rigid monastic rules ; and after in troducing that reformation into the convents of Glastenbury and Abingdon, he endeavoured to render it universal in the kingdom. The minds of men were already wefl prepared for this innovation. The praises of a* inviolable chastity had been carried to the highest extravagance by some of the first preachers of Christianity among the Saxons : The pleasures of love had been repre sented as incompatible with Christian perfection : And a total abllinence from all commerce with the sex was deemed such a meritorious penance, as was sufficient to atone for the greatest enormities. v The consequence seemed natural, that those, at least, who officiated at the altar sliould be clear of this pollution; and when the doctrine of transnbstantia tion, which was now creeping in\"':, was once fully established, the reverence to the real body of Christ in the eucharist bestowed on this argument an addi tional force and influence. The monks knew how to avail themselves of all these popular topics, and to set off their own character to the best advantage. They affected the greatest austerity of life and man ners : They indulged themselves in the highest strains of devotion : They inveighed bitterly against 1 Osbcrne, p. 102. WaIJingford, p. 541.

The secular clergy, on the other hand, who were numerous and rich, and pos sessed of the ecclesiastical dignities, defended them selves with vigour, and endeavoured to retaliate upon their adversaries. The people were thrown into agitation ; and few instances occur of more violent dissensions, excited by the most material dif ferences in religion, or rather the most frivolous : Since it is a just remark, that the more affinity there is between theological parties, the greater commonly is their animosity. The progress of the monks, which was become considerable, was somewhat retarded by the death of Edred, their partisan, who expired after a reign of nine years n : He left children ; but as they were infants, his nephew Edwy, son of Edmund, was placed on the throne.

There was a beautiful princess of the royal blood, called Elgiva, who had made impres sion on the tender heart of Edwy ; and as he was of an age when the force of the passions first begins to be felt, he had ventured, contrary to the advice of his gravest counsellors, and the remonstrances of the more dignified ecclesiastics p, to espouse her ; though she was within the degrees of affinity prohi bited by the canon law q. As the austerity, affected by the monks, made them particularly violent on this occasion, Edwy entertained a strong prepos session against them ; and seemed, on that account, determined not to second their project of expelling the seculars from all the convents, and of possessing themselves of those rich establishments. War was therefore declared between the king and the monks ; and the former soon found reason to repent his pro voking such dangerous enemies. On the day of his coronation, his nobility were assembled in a great hall, and were indulging themselves in that riot and disorder, which, from the example of their German ancestors, had become habitual to the English ' ; when Edwy, attracted by softer pleasures, retired into the queen's apartment, and in that privacy gave reins to his fondness towards his wife, which was only moderately checked by the presence of her mother. Dunstan conjectured the reason of the king's retreat ; and carrying along with him Odo, archbishop of Canterbury, over whom he had gained an absolute ascendant, he burlt into the apartment, upbraided Edwy with his lascivious ness, probably bestowed on the queen the most op probrious epithet that can be applied to her sex, and tearing him from her arms, pushed him back, P W.

Edwy, though young, and opposed by the prejudices of the people, found an opportunity of taking revenge for this public insult. He ques- tioned Dunstan concerning the administration of the treasury during the reign of his predecessor ' ; and when that minister refused to give any account of money expended, as he affirmed by orders of the late king, he accused him os malversation in his office, and banished him the kingdom. But Dun- ftan's cabal was not unactive during his absence : They filled the public with high panegyrics on his sanctity : They exclaimed against the impiety of the king and queen : And having poisoned the minds of the people by these declamations, they proceeded to still more outrageous acts of violence against the royal authority. Archbishop Odo sent into the pa- lace a party of soldiers, who seized the queen ; and having burned her face with a red-hot iron, in order to destroy that fatal beauty which had seduced Edwy, they carried her by force into Ireland, there to remain in perpetual exile \\ Edwy finding it in vain to resist, was obliged to consent to his divorce, which was pronounced by Odo w; and a catastrophe, still more dismal, awaited the unhappy Elgiva. That amiable princess, being cured of her wounds, and having even obliterated the scars with which Odo had hoped to deface her beauty, returned into England, and was flying to the embraces of the king, whom she still regarded as her husoand ; when she fell into the hands of a party, whom the primate had sent to intercept her.

They even proceeded to re bellion against their sovereign ; and having placed Edgar at their head, a younger brother of Edwy, a boy of thirteen years of age, they soon put him in possession of Mercia, Northumberland, East- Anglia ; and chased Edwy into the southern coun ties.

He favoured their scheme for dispossessing the secular canons of all the monasteries'1; he bestowed prefer ment on none but their part'izans ; he allowed Dun stan to resign the see of Worcester into the hands of Oswald, one of his creatures' ; and to place Ethel wold, another of them, in that of Winchester g ; he consulted these prelates in the administration of all ecclesiastical, and even in that of many civil affairs ; and though the vigour of his own genius prevented him from being implicitly guided by them, the king and the bissiops found such advantages in their mu tual agreement, that they always acted in concert, and united their influence in preserving the peace and tranquillity of the kingdom. In order to complete the great work of placing the new order of monks in all the convents, Edgar summoned a general council of the prelates and the heads of the religious orders. He here inveighed against the dissolute lives of the secular clergy ; the smallness of their tonsure, which, it is probable, maintained no longer any resemblance to the crown of thorns ; their negligence in attending the exercise of their function ; their mixing with the laity in the pleasures of gaming, hunting, dancing, and sing ing ; and their openly living with concubines, by which it is commonly supposed he meant their wives. cChron.Sax.p. 117,118.

It is more pro bable that the monks paid court to the populace by an affected austerity of life ; and representing the most innocent liberties, taken by the other clergy, as great and unpardonable enormities, thereby prepared the way for the encrease of their own power and influence. Edgar, however, like a true politician, concurred with the prevailing party ; and he even indulged them in pretensions, which, though they might, when complied with, engage the monks to support royal authority during his own reign, proved afterwards dangerous to his successors, and gave disturbance to the whole civil power.. He seconded the policy of the court of Rome, in granting to some monasteries an exemption from episcopal jurisdic tion : He allowed the convents, even those of royal foundation, to usurp the election of their own abbot: And he admitted their forgeries of ancient charters, by which, from the pretended grant of former kings, they assumed many privileges and immunities '. These merits of Edgar have procured him. the highest panegyrics from the monks; and he is trans mitted to us, not only under the character of acon sommate statesman and an active prince, praises to which he seems to have been justly entitled, but un der that of a great faint and a man of virtue. But nothing could more betray both his hypocrisy in inveighing against the licentiousness of the secular clergy, and the interested spirit of his partizans, in bestowing such eulogies on his piety, than the usual tenor of his conduct, which was licentious to the highest degree, and violated every law, human and divine.

Edgar broke into a convent, carried ossEditha, a nun, by force, and even committed violence on her person11. For this act of sacrilege he was repri manded by Dunstan ; and that he might reconcile himself to the church, he was obliged not to sepa rate from his mistress, but to abstain from wearing his crown during seven years, and to deprive himself so long of that vain ornament ' : A punishment very unequal to that which had been inflicted on the un fortunate Edwy, who, for a marriage which in the strictest sense could only deserve the name of irregu lar, was expelled his kingdom, saw his queen treated with singular barbarity, was loaded with calumnies, and has been represented to us under the most odi ous colours. Such is the ascendant which may be attained, by hypocrisy and cabal, over mankind ! There was another mistress of Edgar's, with whom he first formed a connection by a kind of ac cident. Passing one day by Andover, he lodged in the house of a nobleman, whose daughter, being en dowed with all the graces of person and behaviour, cnflamed him at first sight with the highest desire; and he resolved by any expedient to gratify it. As he had not leisure to employ courtssiip or address for attaining his purpose, he went directly to her mo ther, declared the violence of his passion, and de sired that the young lady might be allowed to pass that very night with him.

Elfleda (for that was the name of the maid), trusting to her own charms, and to the love with which, ssie hoped, she had now inspired the king, made probably but a faint resistance ; and the return of light discovered the deceit to Edgar. He had passed a night so much to his satisfaction, that he expressed no displeasure with the old lady on account of her fraud ; his love was transferred to Elfleda ; ssie became his favourite mistress ; and maintained her ascendant over him till his marriage with Elfridam. The circumstances of his marriage with this lady were more singular and more criminal. Elfrida was daughter and heir of Olgar, earl of Devonssiire ; and though ssie had been educated in the country, and had never appeared at court, ssie had filled all England with the reputation of her beauty. Edgar himself, who was indifferent to no accounts of this nature, found his curiolityexcited by the frequent panegyrics which he heard of Elfrida ; and reflecting on her noble birth, he resolved, if he found her charms answerable to their fame, to obtain possession of her on honourable terms. He communicated his inten- tion to earl Athelwold, his favourite; but used the precaution, before he made any advances to her pa- rents, to order that nobleman, on some pretence to pay them a visit, and to bring him a certain account of the beauty of their daughter. Athelwold, when introduced to the young lady, found general report m W. Malmef. lib. 2. cap. S. Higden, p. 268. to"], [150, "\u00ab* CHAP. 11.

Fie returned to Edgar, and told him, that the riches alone, and high qua lity of Elfrida, had been the ground of the admira tion paid her, and that her charms, far from being anywise extraordinary, would have been overlooked in a woman of inferior station. When he had, by this deceit, diverted the king from his purpose, he took an opportunity, after some interval, of turning again the conversation on Elfrida : He remarked, that though the parentage and fortune of the lady had not produced on him, as on others, any illu sion with regard to her beauty, he could not forbear reflecting that ssie would, on the whole, be an ad. vantageous match for him, and might, by her birth and riches, maV.e him sufficient compensation for the homeliness of her person. If the king, therefore, gave his approbation, he was determined to make proposals in his own behalf to the earl of Devonshire, and doubted not to obtain his, as well as the young lady's consent to the marriage. Edgar, pleased with an expedient for establissiing his favourite's for tune, not only exhorted him to execute his purpose, but forwarded his success by his recommendations to the parents of Elfrida ; and Athelwold was soon made happy in the pcsfeiiiou of his mistress. Dreading, however, the detection of the artifice^ he employed every pretence for detaining Elfrida in the country, and for keeping her at a distance from Edgar. Thk violent paiiion of Athelwold had rendered him blind to the r.ecefiaiy consequences which mull; attend his conduct, and the advantages which the numerous enemies that always pursue a royal favour ite, would, by us means, be able to make against him.

He told him, that he intended to pay him a visit in his castle, and be introduced to the acquaintance of his new-married wife; and Athelwold, as he could not refuse the honour, only craved leave to go before* him a few hours, that he might the better prepare every thing for his reception. He then discovered the whole matter to Elfrida ; and begged her, if ssie had any regard either to her own honour or his life, to conceal from Edgar, by every circumstance of dress and behaviour, that fatal beauty which had seduced him from fidelity to his friend, and had be- trayed him into so many falsehoods. Elfrida pro- mised compliance, though nothing was farther from her intentions. She deemed herself little beholden to Athelwold for a passion which had deprived her of a crown ; and knowing the force of her own charms, she did not despair even yet of reaching that dignity, of which her husband's artifice had be- reaved her. She appeared before the king with all the advantages which the richest attire and the most engaging airs could bestow upon her, and ssie ex- cited at once in his bosom the highest love towards herself, and the most furious desire of revenge against her husband.

But as this simplicity of manners, so highly and often so injudiciously extolled, did not preserve them from barbarity and treachery, the greatest of all vices, and the most incident to a rude unculti vated people, we ought perhaps to deem their ac quaintance with foreigners rather an advantage ; as it tended to enlarge their views, and to cure them of those illiberal prejudices and rustic manners to which islanders are often subject. Another remarkable incident of this reign was the extirpation of wolves from England. This ad vantage was attained by the industrious policy of Edgar. He took great pains in hunting and pur suing those ravenous animals ; and when he found that all thar escaped him had taken ssielter in the mountains and forests of Wales, he changed the tribute of money imposed on the Welssi princes by Athelstan, his predecessor % into an annual tribute of three hundred heads of wolves \u2022, which produced such diligence in hunting them, that the animal has been no more seen in this island. Edgar died after a reign of sixteen years, and in the thirty-third of his age. He was succeeded by Edward, whom he had by his first marriage with the daughter of earl Ordmer.

But the title of Edward was supported by many advantages. He was appointed successor by the will of his fa ther r : He was approaching to man's estate, and might soon be able to take into his own hands the reins of government: The principal nobility, dread ing the imperious temper of Elfrida, were averse to her son's government, which must enlarge her au thority, and probably put her in possession of the regency : Above all, Dunstan, whose character of sanctity had given him the highest credit with the people, had espoused the cause of Edward, over whom he had already acquired a great ascendant ! ; and he was determined to execute the will of Edgar in his favour. To cut off all opposite pretensions, Dunstan resolutely anointed and crowned the young prince at Kingston ; and the whole kingdom, with out farther dispute, submitted to him '. It was of great importance to Dunstan and the monks, to place on the throne a king favourable to their cause : The secular clergy had still partisans in England, who wissied to support them in the pos session of the convents, and of the ecclesiastical au thority. On the first intelligence of Edgar's death, Alfere, duke of Mercia, expelled the new orders of monks from all the monasteries which lay within his jurisdiction u ; but Elfwin, duke of East-Anglia, and Brithnot, dukeof the East-Saxons, protected them within their territories, and insisted upon the execu tion of the late laws enacted in their favour. In order to settle this controversy, there were summon ed several synods, which, according to the practice of those times, consisted partly of ecclesiastical mem bers, partly of the lay nobility.

In one synod, Dunstan finding the majority of votes against him, rose up and informed the audi- ence, that he had that instant received an immedi- ate revelation in behalf of the monks : The assembly was so astonissied at this intelligence, or probably so overawed by the populace, that they proceeded no farther in their deliberations. In another synod, a voice issued from the crucifix, and informed the members that the establissiment of the monks was founded on the will of heaven, and could not be op posed without impiety \\ But the miracle performed in the third synod was still more alarming : The floor of the hall in which the assembly met funk of a sudden, and a great number of the members were either bruised or killed by the fall.

Though his step mother had opposed his succession, and had raised a party in favour of her own son, he always ssiowed her marks of regard, and even expressed, on all occasions, the most tender affection towards his bro ther. He was hunting one day in Dorsetssiire ; and being led by the chase near Corse-castle, where Elfrida resided, he took the opportunity of paying her a visit, unattended bv any of his retinue, and he thereby presented her with the opportunity which ssie had long wissied for.

And as the reigning prince was a minor, and even when he attained to man's estate, never discovered either courage or capacity sufficient to govern his own subjects, much less to repel a. formidable enemy,the people might justly apprehend the worst calamities from so dangerous a crisis.

Six years after, they made a like attempt in the west, and met with like suc cess. The invaders, having now found affairs in a very different situation, from that in which they for merly appeared, encouraged their countrymen to assemble a greater force, and to hope for more con siderable advantages. They landed in Essex, under the command of two leaders ; and having defeated and slain at Maldon, Brithnot, duke of that county, who ventured, with a small body, to attack them* they spread their devastations over all the neigh bouring provinces. In this extremity, Ethelred, to whom historians give the epithet of the Unready, instead of rousing his people to defend with courage their honour and their property, hearkened to the advice of Siricius, archbissiop of Canterbury, which was seconded by many of the degenerate nobility ; and paying the enemy the sum of ten thousand pounds, he bribed them to depart the kingdom. This ssiameful expedient was attended with the suc cess which might be expected. The Danes next year appeared off the eastern coast, in hopes of sub duing a people who defended themselves by their money, which invited assailants, instead of then arms, which repelled them. But the Englissi, sen sible of their folly, had, in the interval, assembled in a great council, and had determined to collect at London a fleet able to give battle to the enemy a ; though that judicious measure failed of luccess, from the treachery of Alfric duke of Mercia, whose name is infamous in the annals of that age, by the cala mities which his repeated perfidy brought upon his country. This nobleman had, in 983, succeeded to his rather Alfere, in that extensive command; a Chron. Sax. p. 126.

Having had experience of the credit and malevolence of his enemies, he thenceforth trusted for security, not to his services, or to the affections of his fellow-citizens, but to the influence which he had obtained over his vassals, and to the public calamities, which he thought must, in every revolution, render his assistance necessary. Having fixed this resolution, he determined to pre vent all such successes as might establift the royal authority, or render his own situation dependent or precarious. As the Englissi had formed the pianos surrounding and destroying the Danissi fleet in har bour, he privately informed the enemy of their danger ; and when they put to sea, in consequence of this intelligence, he deserted to them, with the squadron under his command, the night before the engagement, and thereby disappointed all the efforts of his countrymen b. Ethelred, enraged at his perfi dy, seized his son Alfgar, and ordered his eyes to be put out c. But such was the power of Alfric, that he again forced himself into authority ; and though he had given this specimen of his character, and re ceived this grievous provocation, it was found ne cessary to entrust him anew with the government of Mercia. This conduct of the court, which in all its circumstances is so barbarous, weak, and impru dent, both merited and prognosticated the molt grievous calamities.

Lindesey was laid waste ; Banbury was destroyed ; and all the Northumbrians, though mostly of Danissi descent, were constrained either to join the invaders, or to suffer under their depre dations. A powerful army was assembled to oppose the Danes, and a general action ensued ; but the Englissi were deserted in the battle, from the cow ardice or treachery of their three leaders, all of them men of Danissi race, Frena, Frithegist, and God win, who gave the example of a ssiameful slight to the troops under their command. Encouraged by this success, and still more by the contempt which it inspired for their enemy,- the pirates ventured to attack thecentre of the kingdom ; and entering the Thames in ninety-four vessels, laid siege to London, and threatened it with total de? struction. But the citizens, alarmed at the danger, and firmly united among themselves, made a bolder defence than the cowardice of the nobility and gen try gave the invaders reason to apprehend ; and the besiegers, after suffering the greatest hardssiips, were finally frustrated in their attempt. In order to revenge themselves, they laid waste Essex, Sussex, andHampssiire ; and having there procured horses, they were thereby enabled to spread, through the more inland counties, the fury of their depredations. In this extremity, Ethelred and his nobles had re course to the former expedient ; and sending am bassadors to the two northern kings, they promised them subsistence and tribute, on condition they would, for the present, put an end to their ravages, and soon after depart the kingdom. Sweyn and Olave agreed to the terms, and peaceably took up their quarters at Southampton, where the sum of sixteen thousand pounds was paid to them. Olave even made a journey to Andover, where Ethelred re sided ; and he received the rite of confirmation from the Englissi bissiops, as well as many rich presents from the king. He here promised that he would K 3 neve?"], [160, "KISTORY OF ENGLAND. 134 CHAP III 997 99S, never more infest the Englissi territories ; and he faithfully fulfilled the engagement. This prince receives the appellation of St. Olave from the church of Rome; and, notwithstanding the general pre sumption which lies either against the understand ing or morals of every one who in those ignorant ages was dignified with that title, he seems to have been a man of merit and of virtue. Sweyn, though less scrupulous than Olave, was constrained, upon the departure of the Norwegian prince, to evacuate also the kingdom with all his followers. This composition brought only a short interval to the miseries of the Englissi. The Danissi pirates appeared soon after in the Severne ; and having committed spoil in Wales, as well as in Cornwal and Devonssiire, they sailed round to the south coast, and entering the Tamar, completed the devastation of these two counties. They then returned to the Bristol channel ; and penetrating into the country by the Avon, spread themselves over all that neigh bourhood, and carried fire and sword even into Dor setshire. They next changed the seat of war ; and aster ravaging the Isle of Wight, they entered the Thames and Medway, and laid siege to Rochester, where they defeated the Kentissi-men in a pitched battle. After this victory, the whole province of Kent was made a scene of slaughter, fire, and de vastation. The extremity of these miseries forced the English into counsels for common defence both by sea and land ; but the weakness of the king, the divisions among the nobility, the treachery of some, the cowardice cf others, the want of concert in all, frustrated every endeavour : Their fleets and armies either came too late to attack the enemy, or were repulsed with dissionour ; and the people were thus equally ruined by resistance or by submission. The English therefore, destitute both of prudence and unanimity in council, of courage and conduct in the field, had recourse to the same- weak expedient which"], [161, "ETHELRED J55 which by experience they had already found so in- c h a p. effectual : They offered the Danes to buy peace, by , 1I-_, paying them a large sum of money. These ravagers rose continually in their demands ; and now re quired the payment of 24,000 pounds, to which the English Were so mean and imprudent as to sub mit a. The departure of the Danes procured them another short interval of repose, which they en joyed, as if it were to be perpetual, without making any effectual preparations for a more vigorous re sistance upon the next return of the enemy. Besides receiving this sum, the Danes wet e en gaged by another morke to depart a kingdom which appeared so little in a situation to resist their efforts : They were invited over by their countrymen in Normandy, who at this time were hard pressed by the arms of Robert king of France, and who found it difficult to defend the settlement which, with so much advantage to themselves and glory to their na tion, they had made in that country. It is probable also that Ethelred, observing the close connexions thus maintained among all the Danes, however di vided in government or situation, was desirous of forming an alliance with that formidable people : For this put pose, being now a widower, he made his addresses to Emma, sister to Richard II. duke of Normandy, and he soon succeeded in his nego ciation. The princess came over this year to Eng- 1001. land, and was married to Ethelred b.

He. was exposed in his youth to the jealousy of the king of Denmark, who attacked his small but independ ent principality; and who, being foiled in every assault, had recourse at last to perfidy for effecting his purpose, which he had often attempted in vain by force of arms c : He lulled Rollo into security by an insidious peace ; and falling suddenly upon him, murdered his brother and his bravest officers, and forced him to fly for safety into Scandinavia. Here many of his ancient subjects, induced partly by af fection to their prince, partly by the oppressions of the Danissi monarch, ranged themselves under his standard, and offered to follow him in every enter prise. Rollo, instead os attempting to recover his paternal dominions, where he must expect a vigor ous resistance from the Danes, determined to pur sue an easier, but more important undertaking, and to make his fortune, in imitation of his countrymen, by pillaging the richer and more southern coasts of Europe. Fie collected a body of troops, which, like that of all those ravagers, was composed of Norwegians, Swedes, Frisians, Danes, and adven turers of all nations, who, being accustomed to a roving unsettled life, took delight in nothing but war and plunder. His reputation brought him as sociates from all quarters ; and a vision, which he pretended to have appeared to him in his sleep, and which, according to his interpretation of it, prog nosticated the greatest successes, proved also a power ful incentive with those ignorant and superstitious people d.

The prudent Dane, finding that no advan tages could be gained over such a people, governed by such a prince, soon turned his enterprises against France, which he found more exposed to his in roads\" ; and during the reigns of Eudes, an usurper, and of Charles the Simple, a weak prince, he com mitted the most destructive ravages both on the in land and maritime provinces of that kingdom. The French, having no means of defence, against a leader, who united all the valour of his countrymen with the policy of more civilized nations, were obliged to submit to the expedient practised by Al fred, and to offer the invaders a settlement in some of those provinces which they had depopulated by their armsf. , The reason why the Danes for many years pur sued measures so different from those which had been embraced by the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards, and other northern con querors, was the great difference in the method of attack which was practised by these several nations, and to which the nature of their respective situa tions necessarily confined them. The latter tribes, iiving in an inland country, made incursions by land upon the Roman empire ; and when they entered far into the frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them their wives and families, whom they had no hopes of soon revisiting, and who could not otherwise participate of their plunder. This circumstance quickly made them think of forcing a settlement in the provinces which they had overrun ; and these barbarians, spreading themselves over the country, found an interest in protecting the property and industry of the people whom they had subdued. But the Danes and Norwegians, invited by their \u00ab Gul.

But when they increased their armaments, made incursions into the inland coun tries, and found it safe to remain longer in the midst of the enfeebled enemy, they had been accustomed to crowd their vessels with their wives and chil dren ; and having no longer any temptation to re turn to their own country, they willingly embraced an opportunity of settling in the warm climates and cultivated fields of the south. Affairs were in this situation with Rollo and his followers, when Charles proposed to relinquissi to them part of the province formerly called Neustria, and to purchase peace on these hard conditions. After all the terms were fully settled, there appeared only one circumstance ssiocking to the haughty Dane: He was required to do homage to Charles for this province, and to put himself iif that humiliating posture imposed on vassals by the rites of the feudal law. He long refused to submit to this indignity ; but being unwilling to lose such important advan tages for a mere ceremony, he made a sacrifice of his pride to his interest, and acknowledged himself, in form, the vassal of the French monarch S. Charles gave him his daughter Gisla in marriage ; and, that he might bind him faster to his interests, made him a donation of a considerable territory, besides that which he was obliged to surrender to him by his stipulations.

The Dane, commissioned for this purpose, full of indignation at the order, and despising so unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he mJght kiss it, overthrew him before all his courtiers. The French, sensible of their present weakness, found it prudent to overlook this insult1'. Rollo, who was now in the decline of life, and was tired of wars and depredations, applied himself, with mature counsels, to the settlement of his new acquired territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy ; and he parcelled it out among his cap tains and followers. He followed, in this partition, the customs of the feudal law, which was then uni versally establissied in the southern countries of Eu rope, and which suited the peculiar circumstances of that age. He treated the French subjects, who submitted to him, with mildness and justice; here claimed his ancient followers from their ferocious violence ; he establissied law and order throughout: his state ; and after a life spent in tumults and ra vages, he died peaceably in a good old age, and left his dominions to his posterity '.

Richard, after a long reign of fifty-four years, was succeeded by his son of the fame name, in the year 996 ' ; which was eighty-five years after the first establissiment of the Normans in France. This was the duke who gave his sister Emma in marriage to Ethelred king of England, and who thereby formed connections with a country which his posterity was so soon after des tined to subdue. The Danes had been establissied during a longer period in England than in France ; and though the similarity of their original language to that of the. Saxons, invited them to a more early coalition with the natives, they had hitherto found so little exam ple of civilized manners among the Englissi, that they retained all their ancient ferocity, and valued themselves only on their national character of mili tary bravery. The recent as well as more ancient achievements of their countrymen tended to sup port this idea ; and the English princes, particularly Athelstan and Edgar, sensible of that superiority, had been accustomed to keep in pay bodies of Danissi troops, who were quartered about the country, and committed many violences upon the inhabitants. These mercenaries had attained to such a height of luxury, according to the old Englissi writers m, that they combed their hair once a day, bathed them selves once a week, changed their clothes frequently; and by all these arts of effeminacy, as well as by their military character, had rendered themselves so agreeable to the fair sex, that they debauched the wives and daughters of the Englissi, and dissionoured many families.

The animosity between the inhabitants of Englissi and Danissi race had, from these repeated injuries, risen to a great height ; when Ethelred, from a policy incident to weak princes, embraced the cruel resolution of mas sacring the latter, throughout all his dominions *. Secret orders were dispatched to commence the exe- iaoz cution every where on the same day ; and the festi val of St. Brice, which fell on a Sunday, the day N\"0'- 'I on which the Danes usually bathed themselves, was chosen for that purpose. It is needless to repeat the accounts transmitted concerning the barbarity of this massacre : The rage of the populace, excited by so many injuries, sanctified by authority, and stimulated by example, distinguissied not between innocence and guilt, spared neither sex nor age, and was not satiated without the tortures as well as death of the unhappy victims. Even Gunilda, sister to the king of Denmark, who had married earl Paling, and had embraced Christianity, was, by the advice of Edric, earl of Wilts, seized and condemned to death by F.thelred, after seeing her husband and children butchered before her face. This unhappy princess foretold, in the agonies of despair, that her murder would soon be avenged by the total ruin of the tmglissi nation.

But ail these preparations were frustrated by the treachery of duke Alfric, who was intrusted with the command, and who, feigning sickness, refused to lead the army against the Danes, till it was dispirited, and at last dissipated, by his fatal miscon duct. Alfric soon after died ; and Edric, a greater traitor than he, who had married the king's daugh ter, and had acquired a total ascendant over him, succeeded Alfric, in the government of Mercia, and in the command of the Englissi armies. A great famine, proceeding partly from the bad seasons, partly from the decay of agriculture, added to all the other miseries of the inhabitants. The country, wasted by the Danes, harassed by the fruitless expe ditions of its own forces, was reduced to the utmost desolation ; and at last submitted to the infamy of purchasing a precarious peace from the enemy, by the payment of 30,000 pounds. The Englissi endeavoured to employ this interval in making preparations against the return of the Danes, which they had reason soon to expect.

Bright ric pursued him with a fleet of eighty sail ; but his ships being ssiattered in a tempest, and stranded on the coast, he was suddenly attacked by Wolfoorth, and ah his vessels were burnt and destroyed. The imbecility of the king was little capable of repair ing this misfortune : The treachery of Edric frus trated every plan for future defence ; and the Eng lissi navy, disconcerted, discouraged, and divided, was at last scattered into several harbours. It is almost impossible, or would be tedious, to re late particularly all the miseries to which the Englissi were thenceforth exposed. We hear of nothing but the sacking and burning of towns ; the devastation of the open country ; the appearance of the enemy in every quarter pf the kingdom ; their cruel diligence in discovering any corner which had not been ran* sacked by their former violence. The broken and disjointed narration of the ancient historians is here well adapted to the nature of the war, which was conducted by such sodden inroads as would have been dangerous even to an united and well-governed kingdom, but proved fatal, where nothing but a general consternation and mutual diffidence and dis sension prevailed. The governors of one province refused to march to the assistance of another, and were at last terrified from assembling their forces for the defence of their own province. General coun cils were summoned ; but either no resolution was taken, or none was carried into execution. And th * only expedient in which the Englissi agreed, was the base and imprudent one of buying a new pgace from the Danes, by the payment of 48,000, pounds.

Ethelred, equally afraid of the violence of the enemy and the treachery of his own subjects, fled into Normandy, whither he had sent before him queen Emma, and her two sons Alfred and Edward. Richard received his unhappy guests with a generosity that does ho nour to his memory. The king had not been above six weeks in Nor mandy, when he heard of the death of Sweyn, who expired at Gainsborough, before he had time to establissi himself in his new-acquired dominions. The Englissi prelates and nobility, taking advantage of this event, sent over a deputation to Normandy ; invited Ethelred to return to them, expressing a de sire of being again governed by their native prince, and intimating their hopes, that being now tutored by experience, he would avoid all those errors which had been attended with such misfortunes to himself and to his people. But the misconduct of Ethelred was incurable ; and on his resuming the govern ment, he discovered the same incapacity, indolence, cowardice, and credulity, which had so often ex posed him to the insults of his enemies. His son in-law, Edric, notwithstanding his repeated treasons, retained such influence at court, as to instil into the king jealousies of Sigefert and Morcar, two of the chief nobles of Mercia : Edric allured them into his house, where he murdered them ; while Ethel red participated in the infamy of the action, by con-< fiscating their estates, and thrusting into a convent the widow of Sigefert.

Meanwhile the Englissi found in Canute, the son and successor of Sweyn, an enemv no less ter rible than the prince from whom death had so lately delivered them. He ravaged the eastern coast with merciless fury, and put assiore all the Englissi host ages at Sandwich, after having cut off their hands and noses. He was obliged, by the necessity of his affairs, to make a voyage to Denmark ; but return ing soon after, he continued his depredations along the southern coast : He even broke into the counties of Dorset, Wilts, and Somerset ; where an army was assembled against him, under the command of prince Edmond and duke Edric. The latter still continued his perfidious machinations ; and after endeavouring in vain to get the prince into his power, he found means to disperse the army ; and he then openly deserted to Canute with forty vessels. Notwithstanding this misfortune, Edmond was not disconcerted ; but assembling all the force of England, was in a condition to give battle to the enemy. The king had had such frequent experience of perfidy among his subjects, that he had lost all con fidence in them : He remained at London, pretend ing sickness, but really from apprehensions that they intended to buy their peace, by delivering him into the hands of his enemies. The army called aloud for their sovereign to march at their head against the Danes ; and on his refusal to take the field, they were so discouraged, that those vast preparations be came ineffectual for the defence of the kingdom. Edmond, deprived of all regular supplies to main tain his soldiers, was obliged to commit equal ra vages with those which were practised by the Danes ; and after making some fruitless expeditions into the north, which had submitted entirely to; Canute's Vol. I. 11 \u00a3 'power,"], [172, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 146 CHAP ill C* ' -\u25a0 1016, power, he retired to London, determined there to maintain, to the last extremity, the small remains of Englissi liberty. Fie here found every thing in confusion by the death of the king, who expired after an unhappy and inglorious reign of thirty-five years. Fie left two sons by his first marriage, Ed mond, who succeeded him, and Edwy, whom Ca nute aftewards murdered. His two sons by the second marriage, Alfred and Edward, were imr.ie. diately, upon Ethelred's death, conveyed into Nor mandy by queen Emma. EDMOND IRONSIDE. 'THIS prince, who received the name of Ironside from his hardy valour, possessed courage and abilities sufficient to have prevented his country from sinking into those calamities, but not to raise it from that abyss of misery into which it had already fallen. Among the other misfortunes of the Eng lissi, treachery and disaffection had creeped in among the nobility and prelates ; and Edmond found no better expedient for stopping the farther progress of these fatal evils, than to lead his army instantly into the field, and to employ them against the common enemy. After meeting with some success at Gillingham, he prepared himself to de cide, in one general engagement, the fate of his drown ; and at 6coerston, in the county of Glocef ter, he offered battle to the enemy, who were com manded by Canute and Edric. Fortune, in the be ginning of the day, declared for him 5 but Edric, having cut oft* the head of one Ofmer, whose coun tenance resembled that of Edmond, fixed it on a spear, carried it through the ranks in triumph, and called out to the Englissi, that it was time to fly ; for, behold ! the head of their sovereign. And though Edmond, observing the consternation of the troops, took off his helmet and showed himself to n them,"], [173, "h: CHAP 11- 1017 EDMOND IRONSIDE. them, the Utmost he could gain by his activity and valour was to leaVe the victory undecided. Edric now took a surer method to ruin him ; by pretend ing to desert to him ; and as Edmond was well ac quainted with his power, and probably knew no other of the chief nobility in whom he could repose more confidence, he was obliged, notwithstanding the repeated perfidy of the man, to give him a con siderable command in the army. A battle soon after ensued at Assington in Essex ; where Edric, flying in the beginning of the day, occasioned the total defeat of the Englissi, followed by a great slaughter of the nobility. The indefatigable Edmond, how ever, had still resources : Assembling a new army at Glocester, he Was again in a condition to dispute the field ; when the Danissi and Englissi nobility;, equally harassed by those convulsions, obliged their kings to come to a compromise, and to divide the kingdom between them by treaty. Canute reserved to himself the northern division, consisting of Mer cia, East-Anglia, and Northumberland, which he had entirely subdued : The southern parts were left to Edmond. This prince survived the treaty about a month: He was murdered at Oxford by two of his chamberlains, accomplices of Edric, who thereby made way for the succession of Canute the Dane to the crown of England. CANUTE. THE Englissi, who had been unable to defend their country, and\" maintain their independen cy, under so active and brave a prince as Edmond, could, after his death, expect nothing but total subjection from Canute, who, active and brave him self, and at the head of a great force, was ready to take advantage of the minority of Edwin and Ed ward, the two sons of Edmond. Yet this con queror, who was commonly so little scrupulous, L 2 i ssiowed"], [174, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 148 CHAP, ill \u00ab\u00bb - \u00bb ii ~' ssiowed himself anxious to cover his injustice under plausible pretences : Before he seized the dominions of the Englissi princes, he summoned a general as sembly of the states, in order to fix the succession of the kingdom. He here suborned some nobles to depose that, in the treaty of Glocester, it had been verbally agreed either to name Canute, in case of Edmond's death, successor to his dominions, or tutor to his children (for historians vary in this par ticular) : And that evidence, supported by the great power of Canute, determined the states immediately to put the Danissi monarch in possession of the go vernment. Canute, jealous of the two princes, but sensible that he ssiould render himself extremely odious if he ordered them to be dispatched in Eng land, sent them abroad to his ally the king of Swe den, whom he desired, as soon as they arrived at his court, to free him by their death from all far ther anxiety. The Swedissi monarch was too gene rous to comply with the request ; but being afraid of drawing on himself a quarrel with Canute, by protecting the young princes, he sent them to So lomon king of Hungary, to be educated in his court. The elder Edwin was afterwards married to the sister of the king of Hungary ; but the Eng lissi prince dying without issue, Solomon gave his sister-in-law, Agatha, daughter of the emperor Henry II, in marriage to Edward the younger bro ther ; and ssie bore him Edgar Atheling; Margarets afterwards queen of Scotland, and Christina, who retired into a convent. Canute, though he had reached the great point of his ambition, in obtaining possession of the Eng lissi crown, was obliged at first to make great sacri fices to it ; and'to gratify the. chief of the nobility, by bestowing on them the most extensive govern ments and jurisdictions. He created Thurkill earl or duke of.

But seizing afterwards a favourable opportunity, he expelled Thurkill and Yric from their governments, and ba nissied them the kingdom : He put to death many of the Englissi nobility, on whose fidelity he could not rely, and whom he hated on account of their dis loyalty to their native prince. And even the traitor Edric, having had the assurance to reproach him with his services, was condemned to be executed, and his body to be thrown into the Thames ; a suitable reward for his multiplied acts of perfidy and rebellion. Canute also found himself obliged, in the be ginning of his reign, to load the people with heavy taxes, in order to reward his Danissi followers : He exacted from them at one time the sum of 72,000 pounds; besides 11, coo pounds which he levied on London alone. He was probably willing, from political motives, to mulct severely that city, on account of the affection which it had borne to Ed- mond, and the resistance which it had made to the Danissi power in two obstinate sieges \u00b0. But these rigours were imputed to necessity; and Canute, like a wise prince, was determined that the Englissi, now deprived of all their dangerous leaders, ssiould be reconciled to the Danissi yoke, by the justice and impartiality of his administration. He sent back to Denmark as many of his followers as he could safely spare : he restored the Saxon customs in a general assembly of the states : He made no distinction be tween Danes and Englissi in the distribution of jus tice : And he took care, by a strict execution of law, to protect the lives and properties of all his people.

V tain a little respite from those multiplied calamities from which the one, no less than the other, had, in their fierce contest for power, experienced such fatal consequences. The removal of Edmond's children into so dis- tant a country as Hungary, was, next to their death, regarded by Canute as the greatest security to his government : He had no -farther anxiety, except with regard to Alfred and Edward, who were pro- tected and supported by their uncle, Richard duke of Normandy. Richard even fitted out a great armament, in order to restore the Englissi princes to the throne of their ancestors ; and though the navy was dispersed by a storm, Canute saw the dan. ger to which he was exposed from the enmity of so warlike a people as the Normans. In order to ac- quire the friendssiip of the duke, he paid his ad- dresses to queen Emma, sister of that prince ; and promised that he would leave the children, whom he ssiould have by that marriage, in possession of the crown of England. Richard complied with his demand, and sent over Emma to England, where ssie was soon after married to Canute p. The Eng- lish, though they disapproved of her espousing the mortal enemy of her former husband and his family, were pleased to find at court a sovereign, to whom they were accustomed, and who had already formed connections with them : And thus Canute, besides, securing by this marriage the alliance of Normandy, gradually acquired, by the fame means, the confi- dence of his own subjects H.

Canut#"], [177, "IS* CHAP, III I02S CANUTE Canute, having settled his power in England be yond all danger of a revolution, made a voyage to Denmark, in order to resist the attacks of the king of Sweden ; and he carried along with him a great body of the Englissi, under the command of earl Godwin. This nobleman had here an opportunity of performing a service, by which he both recon ciled the king's mind to the Englissi nation, and, gaining to himself the friendssiip of his sovereign, laid the foundation of that immense fortune which he acquired to his family. He was stationed next the Swedissicamp; and observing a favourable oppor tunity, which he was obliged suddenly to seize, he attacked the enemy in the night, drove them from their trenches, threw them into disorder, pursued his advantage, and obtained a decisive victory over them. Next morning Canute, seeing the Englissi camp entirely abandoned, imagined that those dis affected troops had deserted to the enemy : He was agreeably surprised to find that they were at that time engaged in pursuit of the discomfited Swedes. He was so pleased with his success, and with the manner of obtaining it, that he bestowed his daugh ter in marriage upon Godwin, and treated him ever after with entire confidence and regard. In another voyage, which he made afterwards to Denmark, Canute attacked Norway, and expelling the just but unwarlike Olaus, kept possession of his kingdom till the death of that prince. He had now, by his conquests and valour, attained the utmost height of grandeur : Having leisure from wars and intrigues, he felt the unsatisfactory nature of all hu man enjoyments ; and, equally weary of the glories and turmoils of this life, he began to cast his view towards that future existence, which it is so natural for the human mind, whether satiated by prosperity, or disgusted with adversity, to make the object of its attention. Unfortunately the spirit which pre vailed in that age gave a wrong direction to his de- L 4 votion :"], [178, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 152 CHAP, III, Vg-^VP\u2014 * votion : Instead of making compensation to those whom he had injured by his former acts of violence, he employed himself entirely in those exercises of piety which the monks represented as the most me ritorious. He built churches, he endowed monas teries, he enriched the ecclesiastics, and he bestowed revenues for the support of chantries at Assington and other places ; where he appointed prayers to be said for the souls of those who had there fallen in battle against him. He even undertook a pilgrim age to Rome, where he resided a considerable time : Besides obtaining from the pope some privileges for the Englissi school erected there, he engaged all the princes, through whose dominions he was obliged to pass, to desist from those heavy impositions and tolls which they were accustomed to exact from the Englissi pilgrims. By this spirit of devotion, no less than by his equitable and politic administra tion, he gained, in a good measure, the affections of his subjects. Canute, the greatest and most powerful monarch of his time, sovereign of Denmark and Norway, as well as of England, could not fail of meeting with adulation from his courtiers ; a tribute which is liberally paid even to the meanest and weakest princes. Some of his flatterers breaking out one day in admiration of his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was possible for him : Upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered his chair to be set on the sea-ssiore, while the tide was rising ; and as the waters approached, he commanded them to retire, and to obey the voice of him who was lord of the ocean.

The only memorable action which Canute per formed after his return from Rome, was an expe dition against Malcolm, king of Scotland. During the reign of Ethelred, a tax of a shilling a hide had been imposed on all the lands of England. It was commonly called Danegelt ; because the revenue had been employed either in buying peace with the Danes, or in making preparations against the in roads of that hostile nation. That monarch had required that the fame tax ssiould be paid by Cum berland which was held by the Scots ; but Malcolm, a warlike prince, told him, that as he was always able to repulse the Danes by his own power, he would neither submit to buy peace of his enemies, nor pay others for resisting them. Ethelred, of* fended at this reply, which contained a secret re proach on his own conduct, undertook an expedi tion against Cumberland ; but though he committed ravages upon the country, he could never bring Malcolm to a temper more humble or submissive, Canute, after his accession, summoned the Scottissi king to acknowledge himself a vassal for Cumber land to the crown of England; but Malcolm re fused compliance, on pretence that he owed homage to those princes only who inherited that kingdom by right of blood. Canute was not of a temper to bear this insult ; and the king of Scotland soon found that the sceptre was in very different hands from those of the feeble and irresolute Ethelred. Upon Canute's appearing on the frontiers with a formidable army, Malcolm agreed that his grand son and heir, Duncan, whom he put in possession of Cumberland, ssiould make the submissions re quired, and that the heirs of Scotland ssiould al- ways"], [180, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 154 CHAP 11 %m -\u00bb -' \u00bb\u00abq* ways acknowledge themselves vassals to England for that province r. t , . Canute passed four years in peace after this en terprise, and he died at Shaftsbury S ; leaving three sons, Sweyn, Harold, and Hardicanute. Sweyn, whom he had by his first marriage with Atfwen, daughter of the earl ofHampssiire, was crowned in Norway : Hardicanute, whom Emma had born him, was in possession of Denmark : Harold, who was of the fame marriage with Sweyn, was at that time in England. HAROLD HAREFOOT. rTFIOUGFI Canute, in his treaty with Richard, duke of Normandy, had stipulated that his children by Emma ssiould succeed to the crown of England, he had either considered himself as released from that engagement by the death of Richard, or esteemed it dangerous to leave an unsettled and newly conquered kingdom in the hands of so young a prince as Hardicanute : He therefore appointed, by his will, Harold successor to the crown. This prince was besides present to maintain his claim ; he was favoured by all the Danes; and he got in> mediately possession of his father's treasures, which might be equally useful, whether he found it neces? sary to proceed by force or intrigue in insuring his succession. On the other hand, Hardicanute had the suffrages of the Englissi, who, on account of his being born among them of queen Emma, re garded him as their countryman ; he was favoured by the articles of treaty with the duke of Normandy j and above all, his party was espoused by earl God win, the most powerful nobleman in the kingdom, especially in the province of Weffex, the chief seat ' W.

Affairs were likely to ter, niinate in a civil war ; when, by the interposition of the nobility of both parties, a compromise was made ; and it was agreed that Harold ssiould en joy, together with London, all the provinces north of the Thames, while the possession of the south ssiould remain to Hardicanute ; and till that prince should appear and take possession of his dominions, Emma fixed her residence at Winchester, and esta blissied her authority over her son's ssiare of the par tition. Meanwhile Robert, Duke of Normandy, died in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and being suc ceeded by a son, yet a minor, the two Englissi princes, Alfred and Edward, who found no longer any countenance or protection in that country, glad ly embraced the opportunity of paying a visit, with a numerous retinue, to their mother Emma, who seemed to be placed in a state of so much power and splendor at Winchester, But the face of affairs soon wore a melancholy aspect. Earl Godwin had been gained by the arts of Harold, who pro mised to espouse the daughter of that nobleman ; and while the treaty was yet a secret, these two ty rants laid a plan for the destruction of the Englissi princes. Alfred was invited to London by Harold with many professions of friendssiip ; but when he had reached Guilford, he was set upon by Godwin's vassals, about six hundred of his train were murdered in the most cruel manner, he himself was taken pri soner, his eyes were put out, and he was conducted to the monastery of Ely, where he died soon after'.

This is the only memorable action performed, during a reign of four years, by this prince, who gave so bad a specimen of his character, and whose bodily accomplissiments alone are known to us by his appellation of Harefoot, which he acquired from his agility in running and walking.

On pretence of paying a visit to the queen Dowager in Flanders, he had as sembled a fleet of sixty sail, and was preparing to. make a descent on England, when intelligence of his brother's death induced him to fail immediately to London, where he was received in triumph, and acknowledged king without opposition. The first act of Hardicanute's government af forded his subjects a bad prognostic of his future conduct. Fie was so enraged at Harold, for de priving him of his ssiare of the kingdom, and for the cruel treatment of his brother Alfred, that, in an impotent desire of revenge against the dead, he ordered his body to be dug up, and to be thrown into the Thames : And when it was found by some fissiermen."], [183, "HARDICANUTE 157 CHAP, ill fissiermen, and buried in London, he ordered it again to be dug up, and to be thrown again into the river : But it was fissied up a second time, and then interred with great secrecy. Godwin, equally servile and insolent, submitted to be his instrument in that unnatural and brutal action. That nobleman knew that he was universally believed to have been an accomplice in the barbarity exercised on Alfred, and that he was on that account obnoxious to Hardicanute ; and perhaps he hoped, by displaying this rage against Flarold's memory, to justify himself from having had any participation in his counsels. But prince Edward being invited over by the king, immediately on his appearance, preferred an accusation against Godwin for the mur der of Alfred, and demanded justice for that crime. Godwin, in order to appease the king, made him a magnificent present of a galley with a gilt stern* rowed by fourscore men, who wore each of them a gold bracelet on his arm, weighing sixteen ounces, and were armed and clothed in the most sumptuous manner. Flardicanute, pleased with the splendor of this spectacle, quickly forgot his brother's mur der ; and on Godwin's swearing that he was inno cent of the crime, he allowed him to be acquitted. Though Hardicanute^ before his accession, had been called over by the vows of the Englissi, he soon lost the affections of the nation by his miscon duct ; but nothing appeared more grievous to them, than his renewing the imposition of Danegelt, and obliging the nation to pay a great sum of money to the fleet which brought him from Denmark. The discontents ran high in many places : In Worcester the populace rose, and put to death two of the collectors. The king, enraged at this opposition, swore vengeance against the city, and ordered three noblemen, Godwin, duke of Wessex,.Siward, duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of Mercia, to execute his menaces with the utmost rigour. 9 They"], [184, "J5?

This violent government was of ssiort durations Hardicanute died in two years after his accession, at the nuptials of a Danissi lord, which he had ho noured with his presence.

' J HE Englissi, on the death of Hardicanute, saw a favourable opportunity for recovering their liberty, and for soaking off the Danissi yoke, under which they had so long laboured. Sweyn, king of Norway, the eldest son of Canute, was absent; and as the two last kings had died without issue, none of that race presented himself, nor any whom the Danes could support as successor to the throne. Prince Edward was fortunately at court on his bro ther's demise ; and though the descendants of Ed mond Ironside were the true heirs of the Saxon family, yet their absence in so remote a country as Hungary, appeared a sufficient reason for their ex clusion to a people like the Englissi, so little ac customed to observe a regular order in the succession of their monarchs.

But this concurrence of circumstances in savour of Edward, might have failed of its effect, had his succession been opposed by Godwin, whose power, alliances, and abilities, gave him a great influence at all times, especially amidst those sudden opportu nities which always attended a revolution of govern ment, and which, either seized or neglected, com monly prove decisive. There were opposite reasons which divided men's hopes and fears with regard to Godwin's conduct. On the one hand, the credit of that nobleman lay chiefly in Wessex, which was al most entirely inhabited by Englissi : It was therefore presumed, that he would second the wissies of that people in restoring the Saxon line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom he, as well as they, had reason to dread, as they had already felt, the most grievous oppressions. On the other hand, there subsisted a declared animosity between Edward and Godwin, on account of Alfred's murder, of which the latter had publicly been accused by the prince, and which he might believe so deep an offence as could never, on account of any subsequent merits, be sincerely pardoned. But their common friends here interposed ; and representing the necessity ot their good correspondence, obliged them to lay aside all jealousy and rancour, and concur in re storing liberty to their native country. Godwin only stipulated that Edward, as a pledge of his sin cere reconciliation, should promise to marry his daughter Editha ; and having fortified himself by this alliance, he summoned a general council at Gillingham, and prepared every measure for securing the succession to Edward. The Englissi were una nimous and zealous in their resolutions ; the Danes were divided and dispirited : Any small opposition which appeared in this assembly was brow-beaten and suppressed ; and Edward was crowned king, with every demonstration of duty and affection. .

The triumph of the Englissi, upon this signa1 and decisive advantage, was at first attended with some insult and violence against the Danes ; but the king, by the mildness of his character, soon recon ciled the latter to his administration, and the distinc tion between the two nations gradually disappeared. The Danes were interspersed with the Englissi in most of the provinces ; they spoke nearly the same language ; they differed little in their manners and lav/s ; domestic dissensions in Denmark prevented* for some years, any powerful invasion from thence, which might awaken past animosities ; and as the Norman conquest, which ensued soon after, re duced both nations to equal subjection, there is no farther mention in history of any difference between them. The joy, however, of their present deliver ance made such impression on the minds of the Eng lissi, that they instituted an annual festival for cele brating that great event ; and it was observed in some countries even to the time of Spellman \\ The popularity which Edward enjoyed on his accession, was not destroyed by the first act of his administration, his resuming all the grants of his immediate predecessors ; an attempt which is com monly attended with the most dangerous conse quences. The poverty of the crown convinced the nation that this act of violence was become abso lutely necessary ; and as the loss fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large grants from the late kings, their countrymen, on account of their ser vices in subduing the kingdom, the Englissi were lather pleased to lee them reduced to their primi tive poverty. The king's severity also towards his mother, the queen-dowager, though exposed to some more censure, met not with very general dis approbation. He had hitherto lived on indifferent 0 Spell.

The fame reasons had probably made her unpopular in England ; and though her benefactions to the monks obtained her the favour of that order, the nation was not, in general, displeased to see her stripped by Edward of immense treasures which ssie had amassed. He confined her, during the remainder of her life, in a monastery at Win chester ; but carried his rigour against her no far ther. The stories of his accusing her of a partici pation in her son Alfred's murder, and of a crimi nal correspondence with the bissiop of Winchester, and also of her justifying herself by treading bare foot, without receiving any hurt, over nine burning plough-ssiares, were the inventions of the monkissi historians, and were propagated and believed from the silly wonder of posterity \\ The Englissi flattered themselves that, by the ac cession of Edward, they were delivered for ever from the dominion of foreigners ; but they soon found that this evil was not yet entirely removed. The king had been educated in Normandy ; and had contracted many intimacies with the natives of that country, as well as an affection for their man ners y. The court of England was soon filled with Normans, who, being distinguissied both by the fa vour of Edward, and by a degree of cultivation su perior to that which was attained by the Englissi in those ages, soon rendered their language, customs, and laws, fassiionable in the kingdom.

The courtiers affected to imitate^ that na tion in their dress, equipage, and entertainments : Even the lawyers employed a foreign language in their deeds and papers * : But above all, the church felt the influence and dominion of those strangers : Ulf and William, two Normans, who had formerly been the king's chaplains, were created bissiops of Dorchester and London. Robert, a Norman also, was promoted to the fee of Canterbury y, and al ways enjoyed the highest favour of his master, of which his abilities rendered him not unworthy. And though the king's prudence, or his want of authority, made him confer almost all the civil and military employments on the natives, the ecclesi astical preferments fell often to the ssiare of the Normans ; and as the latter possessed Edward's con fidence, they had secretly a great influence on pub lic affairs, and excited the jealousy of the Englissi, particularly of Earl Godwin z. This powerful nobleman, besides being duke or earl of Wessex, had the counties of Kent and Sussex annexed to his government. His eldest son, Sweyn, possessed the fame authority in the counties of Ox ford, Berks, Glocester, and Hereford : And Ha rold, his second son, was duke of East-Anglia, and at the fame time governor of Essex. The great authority of this family was supported by immense possessions and powerful alliances ; and the abilities, as well as ambition, of Godwin himself, contributed to render it still more dangerous. A prince of greater capacity and vigour than Edward would have found it difficult to support the dignity of the crown under such circumstances ; and as the haughty temper of Godwin made him often forget the re spect due to his prince, Edward's animosity against him was grounded on persona! as well as political considerations, on recent as well as more ancient in- x Ingulf, p. 62. r Chron, Sax. p. 161. * W.

The king, in pursuance of his engage ments, had indeed married Editha, the daughter of Godwin * ; but this alliance became a fressi source of enmity between them. Edward's hatred of the father was transferred to that princess ; and Editha, though possessed of many amiable accomplissiments, could never acquire the confidence and affection of her husoand. It is even pretended that, during the whole course of her life, he abstained from all com merce of love with her ; and such was the absurd admiration paid to an inviolable chastity during those ages, that his conduct in this particular is highly celebrated by the monkissi historians, and greatly contributed to his acquiring the title of faint and confessor b. The most popular pretence on which Godwin could ground his disaffection to the king and his administration, was to complain of the influence of the Normans in the government ; and a declared op position had thence arisen between him and these favourites. It was not long before this animosity broke into action. Eustace, count of Bologne, having paid a visit to the king, passed by Dover in his return : One of his train, being refused en\" trance to a lodging which had been assigned him, attempted to make his way by force, and in the contest he wounded the master of the house. The inhabitants revenged this insult by the death of the stranger ; the count and his train took arms, and murdered the wounded townsman ; a tumult en sued ; near twenty persons were killed on each side ; and Eustace, being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to save his life by flight from the fury of the populace. He hurried immediately to court, and complained of the usage he had met with : The king entered zealously into the quarrel, and was highly a Chron. Sax. p. 1 57. b W. Malm. p. So. Higden, p. 277.

He gave orders to Godwin, in whose government Dover lay, to re- pair immediately to the place, and to punissi the in- habitants for the crime : But Godwin, who desired rather to encourage than repress the popular discon- tents against foreigners, refused obedience, and en- deavoured to throw the whole blame of the riot on the count of Bologne, and his retinue c. Edward, touched in so sensible a point, saw the necessity of exerting the royal authority ; and he threatened Godwin, if he persisted in his disobedience, to make him feel the utmost effects of his resentment. The earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable, and pleased to embark in a cause where it was likely he should be supported by his countrymen, made preparations for his own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward. Under pretence of repressing some disorders on the Welssi frontier, he secretly assembled a great army, and was approaching the king, who resided, without any military force, and without suspicion, at Glocester *'. Edward applied for protection to Siward, duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of Mercia, two powerful noble- men, whose jealousy of Godwin's greatness, as well as their duty to the crown, engaged them to defend the king in this extremity. They hastened to him with such of their followers as they could assemble on a sudden ; and finding the danger much greater than they had at first apprehended, they issued orders for mustering all the forces within their respective governments, and for marching them without delay to the defence of the king's person and authority. Edward, meanwhile, endeavoured to gain time by negociation ; while Godwin, who thought the king * Chron. Say. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81. Higden, p. 279. * Chron. Sax. p. 163. W.

The Englissi, though they had no high idea of Edward's vigour and capacity, bore him great affec tion on account of his humanity, justice, and piety, as well as the long race of their native kings from whom he was descended ; and they hastened from all quarters to defend him from the present danger. His army was now so considerable, that he ven tured to take the field ; and marching to London, he summoned a great council to judge of the rebel lion of Godwin and his sons. These noblemen pre tended at first that they were willing to stand their trial ; but having in vain endeavoured to make their adherents persist in rebellion, they offered to come to London, provided they might receive hostages for their safety : This proposal being rejected, they were obliged to disoand the remains of their forces, and have recourse to flight. Baldwin, earl of Flanders, gave protection to Godwin and his three sons, Gurth, Sweyn, and Tosti ; the latter of whom had married the daughter of that prince ; Harold and Leofwin, two other of his sons, took ssielter in Ire- land. The estates of the father and sons were con fiscated : Their governments were given to others : O^een Editha was confined in a monastery at Ware wel : And the greatness of this family, once so for midable, seemed now to be totally lupplanted and overthrown. But Godwin had fixed his authority on too firm a basis, and he was too strongly supported by alli ances, both foreign and domestic, not to occasion farther disturbances, and make new efforts for his re-establissiment. The earl of Flanders permitted him to purchase and hire ships within his harbours ; and Godwin, having manned them with his fol- M 3 lowers,"], [192, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 166 CHAP 111 lowers, and with freebooters of all nations, put to sea, and attempted to make a descent at Sandwich. The king, informed of his preparations, had equip ped a considerable fleet, much superior to that of the enemy ; and the earl hastily, before their ap pearance, made his retreat into the Flemissi har bours '. The Englissi court, allured by the pre sent security, and destitute of all vigorous counsels, allowed the seamen to disband, and the fleet to go to decay ' ; while Godwin, expecting this event, kept his men in readiness for action. He put to sea immediately, and sailed to the Isle of Wight, where he was joined by Harold, with a squadron which that nobleman had collected in Ireland. He was now master of the sea ; and entering every har bour in the southern coast, he seized all the ssiipsE, and summoned his followers in those counties, which had so long been subject to his government, to assist him in procuring justice to himself, his family, and his country, against the tyranny of foreigners. Re inforced by great numbers from all quarters, he en, tered the Thames ; and appearing before London, threw every thing into confusion. The king alone seemed resolute to defend himself to the last extre mity ; but the interposition of the Englissi nobility, many of whom favoured Godwin's pretensions, made Edward hearken to terms of accommodation ; and the feigned humility of the earl, who disclaimed all intentions of offering violence to his sovereign, and desired only to justify himself by a fair and open trial, paved the way for his more easy admission. It was stipulated, that he ssiould give hostages for his good behaviour, and that the primate and all the foreigners ssiould be banissied : By this treaty, the present danger of a civil war was obviated, but the authority of the crown was considerably impaired, or rather entirely annihilated. Edward, sensible that eSun. Dun. i\u00a36, f Chron. Sax. p. 1 66. 6 Ibid. he"], [193, "EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. 167 CHAP lh he had not power sufficient to secure Godwin's hostages in England, sent them over to his kins man, the young duke of Normandy. Godwin's death, which happened soon after, while he was sitting at table with the king, prevented him from farther establissiing the authority which he had acquired, and from reducing Edward to still greater subjection *. He was succeeded in the go vernment of Weffex, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, and in the office of steward of the houssiold, a place of great power, by his son Harold, who was actuated by an ambition equal to that of his father, and was superior to him in address, in insinuation, and in virtue. By a modest and gentle demeanor, he ac quired the good-will of Edward ; at least softened that hatred which the prince had so long borne his family h ; and gaining every day new partisans by his bounty and affability, he proceeded in a more silent, and therefore a more dangerous manner, to the increase of his authority. The king who had not sufficient vigour directly to oppose his progress, knew of no other expedient than that hazardous one, of raising him a rival in the family of Leofric, duke of Mercia, whole son Algar was invested with the government of East- Anglia, which, before the banissiment of Harold, had belonged to the latter nobleman. But this policy, of balancing opposite parties, required a more steady hand to manage it than that of Edward, and naturally produced fac tion, and even civil broils, among nobles ot such mighty and independent authority. Algar was soon after expelled his government by the intrigues and power of Harold ; but being protected by Griffith, prince of Wales, who had married his daughter, as well as by the power of his father Leofric, he obliged Harold to submit to an accommodation, and was reinstated in the government of East-Anglia. * See note[E] at the end of the volume. h Brompt p. 9^. M 4 Thi*"], [194, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 168 CHAP. HI. This peace was not of long duration : Harold, tak ing advantage of Leofric's death, which happened soon after, expelled Algar anew, and banissied him the kingdom : And though that nobleman made a fressi irruption into East-Anglia with an army of Norwegians, and over-ran the country, his death soon freed Harold from the pretensions of so dan gerous a rival. Edward, the eldest son of Algar, was indeed advanced to the government of Mercia ; but the balance which the king desired to establish between those potent families, was wholly lost, and the influence of Harold greatly preponderated. The death of Siward, duke of Northumberland, made the way still more open to the ambition of that nobleman. Siward, besides his other merits, had acquired honour to England, by his successful con duct in the only foreign enterprise undertaken dur ing the reign of Edward. Duncan, king of Scotr land, was a prince of a gentle disposition, but pos sessed not the genius requisite for governing a coun try so turbulent, and so much infested by the in trigues and animosities of the great. Macbeth, a powerful nobleman, and nearly allied to the crown, not content with curbing the king's authority, car ried still farther his pestilent ambition : He put his sovereign to death ; chased Malcolm Kenmore, his son and heir, into England; and usurped the crown. Siward, whose daughter was married to Duncan, embraced, by Edward's orders, the protection of this distressed family : He marched an army into Scotland ; and having defeated and killed Macbeth in battle, he restored Malcolm to the throne of his ancestors ''. This service, added to his former con nections with the royal family of Scotland, brought a great accession to the authority of Siward in the north ; but as he had lost his eldest son, Osoerne, in the action with Macbeth, it proved in the issue 1055. hW.

His second son, Walthoef, ap peared, on his father's death, too young to be en trusted with the government of Northumberland ; and Harold's influence obtained that dukedom for his own brother Tosti. There are two circumstances related of Siward, which discover his high sense of honour, and his martial disposition. When intelligence was brought him ot his son Osoerne's death he was inconsolable ; till he heard that the wound was received in the breast, and that he had behaved with great gallantry in the action. When he found his own death ap proaching, he ordered his servants to clothe him in a complete suit of armour ; and sitting erect on the couch, with a spear in his hand, declared that in that posture, the only one worthy of a warrior, he would patiently await the fatal moment. The king, now worn out with cares and infirmi ties, felt himself far advanced in the decline of life ; and having no issue himself, began to think of ap pointing a successor to the kingdom. He sent a deputation to Hungary, to invite over his nephew, Edward, son of his elder brother, and the only re maining heir of the Saxon line. That prince, whose succeflion to rhe crown would have been easy and undisputed, came to England with his children, Ed gar, surnamed Atheling, Margaret and Christina ; but his death, which happened a few days after his arrival, threw the king into new difficulties. He law, that the great power and ambition of Harold had tempted him to think of obtaining possession of the throne on the first vacancy, and that Edgar, on account of his youth and inexperience, was very unfit to oppose the pretensions of so popular and enterprising a rival. The animosity which he had long borne to earl Godwin, made him averse to the succession of his son ; and he could not, without extreme reluctance, think of an encrease of gran deur to a family which had risen on the ruins of 1 4 royal"], [196, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 170 CHAP |U royal authority, and which, by the murder of Alfred, his brother, had contributed so much to the weak ening of the Saxon line. In this uncertainty, he se cretly cast his eye towards his kinsman, William duke of Normandy, as the only person whose power, and reputation, and capacity, could support any de stination which he might make in his savour, to the exclusion of Harold and his family '. This famous prince was natural son of Robert duke of Normandy, by Harlotta, daughter of a tanner in Falaise k, and was very early establissied in that grandeur from which his birth seemed to have set him at so great a distance. While he was but nine years of age, his father had resolved to under take a pilgrimage to Jerusalem ; a fassiionable act of devotion, which had taken place of the pilgrim ages to Rome, and which, as it was attended with more difficulty and danger, and carried those religi ous adventurers to the first sources of Christianity, appeared to them more meritorious. Before his de parture, he assembled the states of the dutchy ; and informing them of his design, he engaged them to swear allegiance to his natural son, William, whom, as he had no legitimate issue, he intended, in case he ssiould die in the pilgrimage, to leave successor to his dominions '. As he was a prudent prince, he could not but foresee the great inconveniencies which must attend this journey, and this settlement of his succession ; arising from the perpetual turbulency of the great, the claims of other branches of the ducal family, and the power of the French monarch : But all these considerations were surmounted by the pre vailing zeal for pilgrimages m ; and probably the more important they were, the more would Robert exult in sacrificing them to what he imagined to be his religious duty. 1 ingulf, p.

The regency establissied by Robert encountered great difficulties in supporting the government under this complication of dangers ; and the young prince, when he came to maturity, found himself reduced to a very low condition. But the great qualities, which he soon displayed in the field and in the cabinet, gave encouragement to his friends, and struck a terror into his enemies. Fie opposed himself on all sides against his rebellious subjects, and against foreign invaders ; and by his valour and conduct prevailed in every action. He obliged the French king to grant him peace on rea sonable terms ; he expelled all pretenders to the so vereignty ; and he reduced his turbulent barons to pay submission to his authority, and to suspend their mutual animosities. The natural severity of his temper appeared in a rigorous administration of justice ; and having found the happy effects of this plan of government, without which the laws in thole ages became totally impotent, he regarded it as a fixed maxim, that an inflexible conduct was the first duty of a sovereign. \u00bb W.

The tranquillity which he had establissied in his dominions, had given William leisure to pay a visit to the king of England during the time of Godwin's banissiment ; and he was received in a manner suit able to the great reputation which he had acquired, to the relation by which he was connected with Ed ward, and to the obligations which that prince owed to his family p. On the return of Godwin, and the expulsion of the Norman favourites, Robert, arch bishop of Canterbury, had, before his departure, persuaded Edward to think of adopting William as his successor ; a counsel which was favoured by the king's aversion to Godwin, his prepossessions for the Normans, and his esteem of the duke. That pre late, therefore, received a commission to inform William of the king's intentions in his favour ; and he was the first person that opened the mind of the prince to entertain those ambitious hopes'1. But Edward, irresolute and feeble in his purpose, find ing that the Englissi would more easily acquiesce in the restoration of the Saxon line, had, in the mean time, invited his brother's descendants from Hun gary, with a view of having them recognized heirs to the crown. The death of his nephew, and the inexperience and unpromising qualities of young Edgar, made him resume his former intentions in favour of the duke of Normandy ; though his aver sion to hazardous enterprises engaged him to post pone the execution, and even to keep his purpose secret from all his ministers.

Earl Godwin, when restored to his power and fortune, had given hostages for his good beha- viour ; and among the rest, one son and one grand- son, whom Edward, for greater security, as has been related, had consigned to thecustodvof the duke of Normandy. Flarold, though not aware of the duke's being his competitor, was uneasy that such near rela- tions ssiould be detained prisoners in a foreign coun- try ; and he was afraid lest William ssiould, in favour of Edgar, retain these pledges as a check on the am- bition of any other pretender. He represented, therefore, to the king, his unfeigned submission to royal authority, his steady duty to his prince, and the little necessity there was, after such a uniform trial of his obedience, to detain any longer those hostages who had been required on the first com- posing of civil discords. By these topics, enforced by his great power, he extorted the king's consent to release them ; and in order to effect his purpose, he immediately proceeded, with a numerous reti- nue, on his journey to Normandy. A tempest drove him on the territory of Guy count of Ponthieu, who, being informed of his quality, immediately detained him prisoner, and demanded an exorbitant sum for his ransom. Harold found means to con vey intelligence of his situation to the duke of Nor mandy ; and represented, that while he was pro ceeding to his court, in execution of a commission from the king of England, he had met with this harssi treatment from the mercenary disposition of the count of Ponthieu. William was immediately sensible of the im portance of the incident. He foresaw, that if he could once gain Harold, either by favours or me naces, his way to the throne of England would be open, and Edward would meet with no farther ob stacle in executing the favourable intentions which he"], [200, "i74. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. c h a p. he had entertained in his behalf. He sent, there wiJX-< fore, a messenger to Guy, in order to demand the liberty of his prisoner ; and that nobleman, not daring to refuse so great a prince, put Harold into the hands of the Norman, who conducted him to Rouen. William received him with every demon- stration of respect and friendship ; and after showing himself disposed to comply with his desire, in de- livering up the hostages, he took an opportunity of disclosing to him the great secret, of his pretensions to the crown of England, and of the will which Ed- ward intended to make in his favour. He desired the assistance of Harold in perfecting that design: he made professions of the utmost gratitude in re- turn for so great an obligation ; he promised that the present grandeur of Harold's family, which sup- ported itself with difficulty under the jealousy and hatred of Edward, should receive new increase from a successor, who would be so greatly beholden to him for his advancement. Harold was surprised at this declaration of the duke ; but being sensible that he should never recover his own liberty, much less that of his brother and nephew, if he refused the demand, he feigned a compliance with William, renounced all hopes of the crown for himself, and professed his sincere intention of supporting the will of Edw ard, and seconding the pretensions of the duke of Normandy. William, to bind him faster to his interests, besides offering him one of his daughters in marriage, required him to take an oath that he would fulfil his promises ; and in order to render the oath more obligatory, he employed an artifice well-suited to the ignorance and superstition of the age. He secretly conveyed under the altar, on which Llarold agreed to swear, the reliques of some of the most revered martyrs ; and when Ha* rold had taken the oath, he shewed him the reliqueS, and admonished him to observe religiously an engage- ment which had been ratified by so tremendous a sanction."], [201, "'75 c h a r 11 EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. sanction\". The Englissi nobleman was astonissied ; but dissembling his concern, he renewed the fame professions, and was dismissed with all the marks of mutual confidence by the duke of Normandy. When Flarold found himself at liberty, his am bition suggested casuistry sufficient to justify to him the violation of an oath, which had been extorted from him by fear, and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with the subjection of his native country to a foreign power. He continued still to practise every art of popularity ; to increase the number of his partisans ; to reconcile the minds of the Eng lissi to the idea of his succession ; to revive their hatred of the Normans ; and, by an ostentation of his power and influence, to deter the timorous Ed ward from executing his intended destination in fa vour of William. Fortune, about this time, threw two incidents in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire general favour, and to increase the cha racter which he had already attained, of virtue and abilities. The Welssi, though a less formidable enemy than the Danes, had long been accustomed to infest the western borders ; and after committing spoil on the low countries, they usually made a hasty retreat into their mountains, where they were ssieltered from the pursuit of their enemies, and were ready to seize the first favourable opportunity of renewing their depredations. Griffith, the reigning prince, had greatly distinguissied himself in those incursions ; and his name had become so terrible to the Englissi, that Harold sound he could do nothing more ac ceptable to the public, and more honourable for himself, than the suppressing of so dangerous an enemy. He formed the plan of an expedition against Wales ; and having prepared some light. armed foot to pursue the natives into their fastnesses ' Waee, p. 459, 460. MS. pcne* Cuie, p. 354. W. Malm. p. 93.

Ill HISTORY OF ENGLAND. some cavalry to scour the open country, and a squadron of ships to attack the sea-coast, he em ployed at once all these forces against the Welssi, prosecuted his advantages with vigour, made no in termission in his assaults, and at last reduced the enemy to such distress, that, in order to prevent their total destruction, they made a sacrifice of their prince, whose head they cut off, and sent to Ha rold ; and they were content to receive as their so vereigns, two Welssi noblemen appointed by Ed ward to rule over them. The other incident was no less honourable to Harold. Tosti, brother of this nobleman, who had been created duke of Northumberland, being of a violent tyrannical temper, had acted with such cruelty and injustice, that the inhabitants rose in rebellion, and chafed him from his government. Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who possessed great power in those parts, and who were grandsons of the great duke Leofric, concurred in the insurrection ; and the former, being elected duke, advanced with an army to oppose Flarold, who was commissioned by the king to reduce and chastise the Northumbrians. Before the armies came to action, Morcar, well acquainted with the generous disposition of the Englissi commander, endeavoured to justify his own conduct. He represented to Harold, that Tosti had behaved in a mariner unworthy of the station to which he was advanced, and no one, not even a brother, could support such tyranny without par cipating, in some degree, of the infamy attending it ; that the Northumbrians, accustomed to a legal administration, and regarding it as their birth-right, were willing to submit to the king, but required a governor who would pay regard to their rights and privileges ; that they had been taught by their an cestors, that death was preferable to servitude, and had taken the field, determined to perissi, rather than suffer a renewal of those indignities to which they"], [203, "EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. 177 CHAP in. they had so long been exposed ; and they trusted that Harold, on reflection, would not defend in an other that violent conduct, from which he himself, in his own government, had always kept at so great a distance. This vigorous remonstrance was ac companied with such a detail of facts, so well sup ported, that Harold found it prudent to abandon his brother's cause; and returning to Edward, he persuaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to confirm Morcar in the government. He even married the sister of that nobleman ' ; and by his interest, procured Edwin, the younger brother, to be elected into the government of Mercia. Tosti in a rage departed the kingdom, and took ssielter in Flanders with earl Baldwin, his father-in-law. By this marriage Harold broke all measures with the duke of Normandy ; and William clearly per ceived that he could no longer rely on the oaths and promises which he had extorted from him. But the Englissi nobleman was now in such a situation, that he deemed it no longer necessary to dissemble.

While he continued in this uncertainty he was surprised by sickness, which brought him to his grave, on the fifth of January 1066, in the sixty-fifth year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign. This prince, to whom the monks gave the title of faint and confessor, was the last of the Saxon line that ruled in England. Though his reign was peaceable and fortunate, he owed his prosperity less to his own abilities than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, employed in other enterprises, attempted not those incursions which had been so troublesome to all his predecessors, and fatal to some of them. The facility of his disposition made him acquiesce under the government of Godwin and his son Harold ; and the abilities, as well as the power of these noblemen enabled them, while they were entrusted with authority, to preserve domestic peace and tranquillity. The most commendable circum stance of Edward's government, was his attention to the administration of justice, and his compiling, for that purpose, a body of laws, which he collected from the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, though now lost (for the laws that pass under Edward's name were composed afterwards \"), was long the object of affection to the Englissi nation.

Enraged at the successful ambition of Harold, to which he himself had fallen a victim, he filled the court of Baldwin with com plaints of the injustice which he had suffered : He engaged the interest of that family against his bro ther : He endeavoured to form intrigues with some of the discontented nobles in England : He sent his emissaries to Norway, in order to rouse to arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and to excite their hopes of reaping advantage from the unsettled state of affairs on the usurpation of the new king : And that he might render the combination more formi dable, he made a journey to Normandy ; in expecta tion that the duke, who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin, would, in revenge of his own wrongs, as well as those of Tosti, second, by his counsels and forces, the projected invasion of England x. The duke of Normandy, when he first received intelligence of Harold's intrigues and accession, had been moved to the highest pitch of indignation ; but that he might give the better colour to his preten sions, he Tent an embassy to England, upbraiding that prince with his breach of faith, and summon ing him to resign immediately possession of the king dom. Harold replied to the Norman ambassadors, that the oath, with which he was reproached, had been extorted by the well-grounded fear of violence, and could never, for that reason, be regarded as obligatory : That he had had no commission, either from the late king, or the states of England, who alone could dispose of the crown, to make any ten-' der of the succession to the duke of Normandy ; and if he, a private person, had assumed so much au- thority, and had even voluntarily sworn to support the duke's pretensions, the oath was unlawful, and * Order.

Consulting only his courage, his resentment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the difficulties inseparable from an at tack on a great kingdom by such inferior force, and he saw only the circumstances which would facilitate his enterprise. He considered that England, ever since the accession of Canute, had enjoyed profound tranquillity, during a period of near fifty years ; and it would require time for its soldiers, enervated by long peace, to learn discipline, and its generals ex perience. He knew that it was entirely unpro vided with fortified towns, by which it could pro long the war ; but must venture its whole fortune in one decisive action against a veteran enemy, who, being once master of the held, would be in a con dition to overrun the kingdom.

The Normans, as they had long been distin guished by valour among all the European nations, had at this time attained to the highest pitch of mi litarv glory. Besides acquiring by arms such a no ble territory in France, besides defending it against continual attempts of the French monarch and all its neighbours, besides exerting many acts of vi gour under their present sovereign ; they had, about this very time, revived their ancient fame, by the most hazardous exploits, and the most wonderful successes, in the other extremitr of Europe. A few Norman adventurers in Italy had acquired such an ascendant, not only over the Italians and Greeks, but the Germans and Saracens, that they expelled those foreigners, procured to themselves ample esta blissiments, and laid the foundation of the opulent kingdom of Naples and Sicily z. These enterprises of men, who were all of them vassals in Normandy, many of them banissied for faction and rebellion, excited the ambition of the haughty William ; who disdained, after such examples of fortune and va lour, to be deterred from making an attack on a neighbouring country, where he could be supported by she whole force of his principality. The situation also of Europe inspired William with hopes, that, besides his brave Normans, he might employ against England the slower of the mi litary force which was dispersed in all the neighbour ing states. France, Germany, and the Low Coun tries, by the progress of the feudal institutions, were divided and subdivided into many principalities and baronies ; and the possessors, enjoying the civil ju- * Gul.

HAROLD, tisdiction within themselves, as well as the right of arms, acted, in many respects, as independent so vereigns, and maintained their properties and pri vileges, less by the authority of laws than by their own force and valour. A military spirit had uni versally diffused itself throughout Europe ; and the several leaders, whose minds were elevated by their princely situation, greedily embraced the most ha zardous enterprises ; and being accustomed to no thing from their infancy but recitals of the success attending wars and battles, they were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate those adventures, which they heard so much celebrated, and which were so much exaggerated by the credulity of the age. United, however loosely, by their duty to one superior lord, and by their connections with the great body of the community to which they be longed, they desired to spread their fame each be yond his own district ; and in all assemblies, whe ther instituted for civil deliberations, for military expeditions, or merely for ssiow and entertainment, to outssiine each other by the reputation ot strength and prowess. Hence their genius for chivalry ; hence their impatience of peace and tranquillity ; and hence their readiness to embark in any dan gerous enterprise, how little soever interested in its failure or success. William, by his power, his courage, and his abilities, had long maintained a pre-eminence among those haughty chieftains; and every one who de sired to signalize himself by his address in military exercises, or his valour in action, had been ambi tious of acquiring a reputation in the court and in the armies of Normandy. Entertained with that hospitality and courtesy which distinguissied the age, they had formed attachments with the prince, and greedily attended to the prospects of the signal glory and elevation which he promised them in return for their concurrence in an expedition against England. N 4 The"], [210, "]84 C HA P III. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. The more grandeur there appeared in the attempt, the more it suited their romantic spirit : The fame of the intended invasion was already diffused every where : Multitudes crowded to tender to the duke their service, with that of their vassals and retainers* : And William found less difficulty in completing his levies, than in chusing the most veteran forces, and in rejecting the offers of those who were impatient to acquire fame under so renowned a leader. Besides these advantages, which William owed to his personal valour and good conduct ; he was indebted to fortune for procuring him some assist- ance, and also for removing many obstacles which it was natural for him to expect in an undertaking, in which all his neighbours were so'deeply interested. Conan, count of Britanny, was his mortal enemy : In order to throw a damp upon the duke's enter- prise, he chose this conjuncture for reviving his claim to Normandy itself; and he required, that in case of William's success against England, the possession of that dutchy ssiould devolve to him b. But Co- nan died suddenly after making this demand ; and Hoel, his predecessor, instead of adopting the malig. nity, or, more propeHy speaking, the prudence of his successor, zealously seconded the duke's views, and sent his eldest son, Alain Fergant, to serve un* der him with a body of five thousand Britons. The counts of Anjou and of Flanders encouraged their subjects to engage in the expedition ; and even the court of France, though it might justly fear the ag-. grandizement of so dangerous a vassal, pursued not its interests on this occasion with sufficient vigour and resolution. Philip I. the reigning monarch, was a minor ; and William, having communicated his project to the council, having desired assistance, and offered to do homage, in case of his success, for the crown of England, was indeed openly or- * Gul. pictavensis, p. 198. k Gul.

HI HAROLD. dered to lay aside all thoughts of the enterprise; but the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law, being at the head of the regency, favoured under-hand his levies, and secretly encouraged the adventurous no bility to insist under the standard of the duke of Normandy. The emperor, Henry IV. besides openly giving all his vassals permission to embark in this expedi tion, which so much engaged the attention of Eu rope, promised his protection to the dutchy of Nor mandy during the absence of the prince, and there by enabled him to employ his whole force in the in vasion of England c. But the most important ally, whom William gained by his negociations, was the pope, who had a mighty influence over the ancient barons, no less devout in their religious principles, than valorous in their military enterprises. The Roman pontiff, after an insensible progress during several ages of darkness and ignorance, began now to lift his head openly above all the princes of Eu rope ; to assume the office of a mediator, or even an arbiter, in the quarrels of the greatest monarchs ; to interpose in all secular affairs ; and to obtrude his dictates as sovereign laws on his obsequious dis ciples. It was a sufficient motive to Alexander II. the reigning pope, for embracing William's quar rel, that he alone had made an appeal to his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the dispute between him and Harold ; but there were other advantages which that pontiff foresaw must result from the conquest of England by the Norman arms. That kingdom, though at first converted by Romissi mis sionaries, though it had afterwards advanced some farther steps towards subjection to Rome, main tained still a considerable independence in its eccle siastical administration ; and forming a world within itself, entirely separated from the rest of Europe, it * Gul.

Thus were all the ambition and violence of that invasion covered over safely with the broad mantle of religion. The greatest difficulty which William had to en, counter in his preparations, arose from his own subjects in Normandy. The states of the dutchy were assembled at Lislcbonne ; and supplies being demanded for the intended enterprise, which proT mised so much glory and advantage to their coun, try* there appeared a reluctance m many members, both to grant sums so much beyond the common measure of taxes in that age, and to set a precedent of performing their military service at a distance from their own country. The duke, finding it dangerous to solicit them in a body, conferred lepa^ rately with the richest individuals in the province-, and beginning with thole on whose affections he most relied, he gradually engaged all of them to advance the sums demanded. The count of Longue vijse seconded him in this negociation ; as did the count of Mortaigne, Odo bissiop of Baieux, and especially William Fitz-Osoorne, count of Breteuil, aud constable of the dutchy. Every person, when he himself was once engaged, endeavoured to bring d Eaker, p. 22. edit. 1684. over"], [213, "HAROLD 187 CHAP, III over others ; and at last the states themselves, after stipulating that this concession ssiould be no pre cedent, voted that they would assist their prince to the utmost in his intended enterprise'. William had now assembled a fleet of 3000 vessels great and small f, and had selected an army of 6.0, cop men from among those numerous supplies which from every quarter solicited to be received into his service. The camp bore a splendid yet a martial appearance, from the discipline of the men, the beauty and vigour of the horses, the lustre of the arms, and the accoutrements of both ; but above all, from the high names of nobility who en gaged under the banners of the duke of Normandy. The most celebrated were Eustace count of Bou logne, Aimeri de Thouars, Flu'gh d'Estaples, Wil siamd'Evreux, Geoffrey de Rotrou, KogerdeBeau mont, William de Warenne, Roger de Montgo mery, Hugh de Grantmesnil, Charles Martel, and Geoffrey Giffard6. To these bold chieftains Wil liam held up the spoils of England as the prize of their valour ; and pointing to the opposite ssiore, called to them, that there was the field, on .which they must erect trophies to their name, and six their tstablifiiments. While he was making these mighty preparations, the duke, that he might encreale the number of Harold's enemies, excited the inveterate rancour of Tosti, and encouraged him, in concert with Harold Halfagar, king of Norway, to infest the coasts of England. Tosti, having collected about sixty ves sels in the ports of Flanders, put to sea ; and after committing some depredations on the south and east coasts, he sailed to Northumberland, and was there joined by Halfagar, who came over with a great armament of three hundred fail.

The action ended in the de feat and flight of these two noblemen. Harold, informed of this defeat, hastened with an army to the protection of his people ; and ex pressed the utmost ardour to show himself worthy of the crown which had been conferred upon him. This prince, though he was not sensible of the full extent of his danger, from the great combination against him, had employed every art of popularity to acquire the affections of the public ; and he gave so many proofs of an equitable and prudent admi nistration, that the Englissi found no reason to re pent the choice which they had made of a sovereign. They flocked from all quarters to join his standard ; and as soon as he reached the enemy at Standford, he found himself in a condition to give them battle. The action was bloody ; but the victory was decisive on the side of Harold, and ended in the total rout of the Norvegians, together with the death of Tosti and Halfagar. Even the Norvegian fleet fell into the hands of Harold ; who had the generosity to give prince Olave, the son of Halfagar, his liber ty, and allow him to depart with twenty vessels. But he had scarcely time to rejoice for this victory, when he received intelligence that the duke of Nor mandy was landed with a great army in the south of England. The Norman fleet and army had been assembled, early in the summer, at the mouth of the small river Dive, and all the troops had been instantly em barked ; but the winds proved long contrary, and detained them in that harbour. The authority, however, of the duke, the good discipline main tained among the seamen and soldiers, and the great care in supplying them with provisions, hid pre vented any disorder ; when at last the wind became favour-"], [215, "HAROLD. 189 favourable, and enabled them to sail along the coast chap. till they reached St. Valori. There were, however, . u\\ t several vessels lost in this ssiort passage ; and as the wind again proved contrary, the army began to imagine that Heaven had declared against them, and that, notwithstanding the pope's benediction, they were destined to certain destruction. These bold warriors, who despised real dangers, were very sub ject to the dread of imaginary ones ; and many of them began to mutiny, some of them even to desert their colours ; when the duke, in order to support their drooping hopes, ordered a procession to be made with the reliques of St. Valori h, and prayers to be said for more favourable weather. The wind instantly changed ; and as this incident happened on the eve of the feast of St. Michael, the tutelar faint of Normandy, the soldiers, fancying they saw the hand of heaven in all these concurring circumstances, set out with the greatest alacrity : They met with no opposition on their passage: A great fleet, which Harold had assembled, and which had cruised all summer off the Isle of Wight, had been dismissed, on his receiving false intelligence that William, dis couraged by contrary winds and other accidents, had laid aside his preparations. The Norman armament, proceeding in great order, arrived, without any ma terial loss, at Pevensey in Sussex ; and the army quietly disembarked. The duke himself, as he leaped on ssiore, happened to stumble and fall ; but had the presence of mind, it is said, to turn the omen to his advantage, by calling aloud that he had taken possession of the country. And a soldier, running to a neighbouring cottage, plucked some thatch, which, as if giving him scizine of the king dom, he presented to his general. The joy and alacrity of William and his whole army was so great, that they were nowise discouraged, even when they h Higden, p. 285. Order. Vitalis, p. JCO. Matth. Paris, \u00abdit.

The victory of Harold, though great and ho nourable, had proved in the main prejudicial to his interests, and may be regarded as the immediate' cause of his ruin. He lost many of his bravest offi cers and soldiers in the action ; and he disgusted the rest by refusing to distribute the Norvegian spoils among them : A conduct which was little agreeable to his usual generosity of temper ; but which his de sire of sparing the people, in the war that impended over him from the duke of Normandy, had proba bly occasioned. He hastened, by quick marches, to reach this new invader ; but though he was rehv forced at London and other places with fressi troops, he found himself also weakened by the desertion of his old soldiers, who from fatigue and discontent secretly withdrew from their colours. His brother Gurth, a man of bravery and conduct, began to. en tertain apprehensions of the event ; and remonstrated with the king, that it would be better policy to pro long the war ; at least, to spare his own person in the action. He urged to him, that the desperate situation of the duke of Normandy made it requi site for that prince to bring matters to a speedy deci sion, and put his whole fortune on the issue of a bat tle; but that the king of England, in his own coun try, beloved by his subjects, provided with every supply, had more certain, and less dangerous means of ensuring to himself the victory : That the Norman troops, elated on the one hand with the highest hopes, and seeing, on the other, no resource in case of a discomfiture, would fight to the last extremity ; and being the flower of all the warriors of the con tinent, must be regarded as formidable to the Eng lissi : That if their first sire, which is always the most dangerous, were allowed to languifn for want of action ; if they were harassed with small skirmissies,. straightened in provisions, and fatigued with the bad 9 weather"], [217, "igt CHAP. in HAROLD. weather and deep foads during the winter season, which was approaching, they must fall an easy and a bloodless prey to their enemy : That if a general action wtefe delayed, the Englissi, sensible of the im minent danger to which their properties, as Well a9 liberties, were exposed from those rapacious inva ders, would hasten from all quarters to his assistance, and would render his army invincible : That at least, if he thought it necessary to hazard a battle, he ought not to expose his own person, but reserve, in cafe of disastrous accidents, some resource to the liberty and independence of the kingdom : And that hav ing once been so unfortunate as to be constrained to swear, and thit upon the holy reliques, to support the pretensions of the duke of Normandy, it were better that the command of the army ssiould be en trusted to another, who, not being bound by those sacred ties, might give the soldiers more assured hopes of a prosperous issue to the combat. Harold was deaf to all these remonstrances : Elated with his past prosperity, as well as stimulated by his native courage, he resolved to give battle in person ; and for that purpose he drew near to the Normans, who had removed their camp and fleet to Hastings, where they fixed their quarters. He was so confident of success, that he sent a message to ths duke, promising him a sum of money if he would depart the kingdom without effusion of blood: But his offer was rejected with disdain ; and William, not to be behind with his enemy in vaunting, sent him a message by some monks, requiring him either to resign the kingdom, or to hold it of him in fealty, or to submit their cause to the arbitration of the pope, or to fight him in single combat.

The Englissi and Normans now prepared them* selves for this important decision ; but the aspect of things, on the night before the battle, was very different in the two camps. The Englissi spent the time in riot, and jollity, and disorder 5 the Normans in silence, and in prayer, and in the other functions of their religion k. On the morning, the duke called together the most considerable of his com manders, and made them a speech suitable to the occasion. He represented to them, that the event which they and he had long wissied for, was ap proaching ; the whole fortune of the war now de pended on their swords, and would be decided in a single action : That never army had greater motives for exerting a vigorous courage, whether they con sidered the prize which would attend their victory, or the inevitable destruction which must ensue upon their discomfiture : That if their martial and veteran bands could once break those raw soldiers, who had rashly dared to approach them, they conquered a kingdom at one blow, and were justly entitled to all its possessions as the reward of their prosperous valour : That, on the contrary, if they remitted in the least their wonted prowess, an enraged enemy hung upon their rear, the sea met them in their retreat, and an ignominious death was the certain punissiment of their imprudent cowardice : That, by collecting so numerous and brave a host, he had en? sured every human means of conquest ; and the commander of the enemy, by his criminal conduct, had given him just cause to hope for the favour of the Almighty, in whose hands alone lay the event of wars and battles: And that a perjured usurper, ana thematized by the sovereign pontiff, and conscious of his own breach of faith, would be struck with terror on their appearance, and would prognosti* k W.

The duke next divided his army into three lines : The first, led by Montgo mery, consisted of archers and light-armed infantry : The second, commanded by Martel, was composed of his bravest battalions, heavy armed, and ranged In close order : His cavalry, at whose head he placed himself, formed the third line \\ and were so disposed, that they stretched beyond the infantry, and flanked each wing of the army m. He ordered the signal of battle to be given ; and the whole army, moving at once, and singing the hymn of song of Roland, the famous peer of Charlemagne n, advanced in order and with alacrity towards the enemv.

His presence restored the action ; the English were obliged to retire with loss ; and the duke, ordering his second line to advance, renewed the attack with fressi forces, and with redoubled courage. Finding that the enemy, aided by the advantage of ground, and animated by the .example of their prince, still made a vigorous resistance, he tried a stratagem, which was very delicate in its management, but which seemed advisable in his desperate situation, where, if he gained not a decisive victory, he was totally undone : He commanded his troops to make a hasty retreat, and to allure the enemy from their ground by the appearance of flight. The artifice succeeded against those unexperienced soldiers, who, heated by the action, and sanguine in their hopes, precipitately followed the Normans into the plain. William gave orders, that at once the infantry ssiould\" face about upon their pursuers, and the ca valry make an assault upon their wings, and both of them pursue the advantage, which the surprise and terror of the enemy must give them in that cri tical and decisive moment. The Englissi were xt pulsed with great slaughter, and driven back to the hill ; where, being rallied by the bravery of Harold, they were able, notwithstanding their loss, to main tain the post, and continue the combat. The duke tried the fame stratagem a second time with the same success ; but even after this double advantage, he still found a great body of the Englissi, who, maintaining themselves in firm array, seemed deter mined to dispute the victory to the last extremity. Fie ordered his heavy armed infantry to make an assault upon them; while his archers, placed behind, should gall the enemy, who were exposed by the situ ation of the ground, and who were intent on defend ing themselves against the swords and spears of the assailants.

A few troops, however, of the vanquissied, had still the courage to turn upon their pursuers ; and attack ing them in deep .and miry ground, obtained some revenge for the slaughter and dissionour of the day. But the appearance of the duke obliged them to seek their safety by flight ; and darkness saved them from any farther pursuit by the enemy. . Thus was gained by William, duke of Nor mandy, the great and decisive victory of Hastings, after a battle which was fought from morning till sunset, and which seemed worthy, by the heroic va lour displayed by both armies, and by both com manders, to decide the fate of a mighty kingdom. William had three horses killed under him ; and there fell near fifteen thousand men on the side of the Normans : The loss was still more considerable on that of the vanquissied -f besides the death of the king and his two brothers.

The military despotism, which had taken place in the Roman em pire, and which, previously to the irruption of those conquerors, had funk the genius of men, and de stroyed every noble principle of science and virtue, was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free people ; and Europe, as from a new epoch, re kindled her ancient spirit, and ssiook off the base servitude to arbitrary will and authority under which ssie had so long laboured.

Succession ol the kings, HISTORY OF ENGLAND. the globe maintain sentiments of liberty, honour, equity, and valour, superior to the rest of mankind, it owes these advantages chiefly to the seeds im planted by those generous barbarians. The Saxons who subdued Britain, as they en joyed great liberty in their own country, obstinately retained that invaluable possession in their new set tlement ; and they imported into this island the fame principles of independence, which they had inhe rited from their ancestors: The chieftains (for such they were, more properly than kings or princes) who commanded them in those military expeditions, still possessed a \\nsry limited authority ; and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than subdued, the an cient inhabitants, they were indeed transplanted into a new territory, but preserved unaltered all their civil and misitary institutions. The language was pure Saxon ; even the names of places, which often remain while the tongue entirely changes, were al most all affixed by the conquerors ; the manners and customs were wholly German; and the fame picture of a fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, will suit those founders of the Englissi government. The king, so far from being invested with arbitrary power, was only con sidered as the first among the citizens ; his authority depended more on his personal qualities than on his station ; he was even so far on a level with the people, that a stated price was fixed for his head, and a legal fine was levied upon his murderer, which, though proportionate to his station, and superior to that paid for the life of a subject, was a sensible mark of his subordination to the community. It is easy to imagine, that an independent people, so little restrained by law and cultivated by science, would not be very strict in maintaining a regular suc cession of their princes. Though they paid great regard to the royal family, and ascribed to it an un disputed superiority; they either had no rule, or none"], [225, "APPENDIX I 199 Appendix I. none that was steadily observed, in filling the va cant throne ; and present convenience, in that emergency, was more attended to than general prin ciples. We are not, however, to suppose that the crown was considered as altogether elective ; and that a regular plan was traced by the constitution for supplying, by the suffrages of the people, every vacancy made by the demise of the first magistrate. If any king left a son of an age and capacity sit for government, the young prince naturally stepped into the throne : If he was a minor, his uncle, or the next prince of the blood, was promoted to the govern ment, and left the sceptre to his posterity : Any so vereign, by taking previous measures with the lead ing men, had it greatly in his power to appoint his successor: All these changes, and indeed the ordi nary administration of government, required the express concurrence, or at least the tacit acqui escence of the people ; but possession, however ob tained, was extremely apt to secure their obedience, and the idea of any right, which was once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is so much the casein all barbarous monarchies, and occurs so often in the hislory of the Anglo-Saxons, that we cannot consistently entertain any other notion of their go vernment. The idea of an hereditary succession in authority is so natural to men, and is so much forti fied by the usual rule in transmitting private posses sions, that it must retain a great influence on every society, which does not exclude it by the refinements of a republican constitution. But as there is a ma terial difference between government and private possessions, and every man is not as much qualified for exercising the one, as for enjoying the other, a people, who are not sensible of the general advan tages attending a fixed rule, are apt to make great leaps in the succession, and frequently to pass over the person, who, had he possessed the requisite years and abilities,' would have been thought entitled to O 4 the"], [226, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 200 Appendix I. The Wit teua&embt, the sovereignty. Thus, these monarchies are not, strictly speaking, either elective or hereditary ; and though the destination of a prince may often be foU lowed in appointing his successor, they can aa little be regarded as wholly testamentary. The states by their suffrage may sometimes establissi a sovereign ; but they more frequently recognize the person whom they find establissied ; A few great men take the lead ; the people, overawed and influenced, acqui esce in the government ; and the reigning prince, provided he be of the royal family, passes undis putedly for the legal sovereign. It is confessed, that our knowledge of the Anglo* Saxon history and antiquities is too imperfect to a^ ford us means of determining, with certainty, all the prerogatives of the crown and privileges of the people, or of giving an exact delineation of that government. It is probable also, that the constitu tion might be somewhat different in the different kingdoms of the Heptarchy, and that it changed considerably during the course of six centuries, which elapsed from the first invasion of the Saxons till the Norman conquest \u00b0. But most of these dif ferences and changes, with their causes and effects, are unknown to us : It only appears, that at all times, and in all the kingdoms, there was a national council, called a Wittenagemot, or assembly of the wise men (for that is the import of the term), whose consent was requisite for enacting laws, and for rati fying the chief acts of public administration. The preambles to all the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, \u00bb We know of one change, not inconsiderable, in the Saxon eonllitution. The Saxon annals, p. 4.9, inform us, that it was in early times the prerogative of the king to name the dukes, earls, aldermen, and sheriffs of the counties. Asser, afcontempo rary writer, informs us that Alfred deposed all the ignorant al dermen, and apppinted men of more capacity in their place: Yet rhe laws of Edward the Confessor, $ 35. fay expressly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the sheriffs, were chosen by the free holders in thesolkmote, a councy court, which wasassembledonce s\u00ab year, and where all the freeholders swore allegiance to the king; Edward"], [227, "2or Appendix 1 APPENDIX I Edward the Elder, Athelstan, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred,-and Edward the Confessor ; even those to the laws of Canute, though a kind of conqueror ; put this matter beyond controversy, and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal government. But who were the constituent members of this Wit tenagemot has not been determined with certainty by antiquaries. It is agreed, that the bissiops and abbotsp were an essential part ; and it is also evi dent, from the tenor of those ancient laws, that the Wittenagemot enacted statutes which regulated the ecclesiastical as well as civil government, and that those dangerous principles, by which the church is totally severed from the state, were hitherto un known to the Anglo-Saxons q. It also appears, that the aldermen, or governors of counties, who after the Danissi times were often called earls *, were ad mitted into this council, and gave their consent to the public statutes. But besides the prelates and al dermen, there is also mention of the wites, or wise men, as a component part of the Wittenagemot ; but who these were, is not so clearly ascertained by the laws or the history of that period. The matter would probably be of difficult discussion, even were it examined impartially; but as our modern parties have chosen to divide on this point, the question has been disputed with the greater obstinacy, and the arguments on both sides have become, on that account, the more captious and deceitful. Our mo narchical faction maintain, that these wites, or fa pientes, were the judges, or men learned in the law : The popular faction assert them to be representa tives of the boroughs, or what we now call the commons. f Sometimes abbesses were admitted ; at least they often sign the king's charters or grants.

The expressions employed by all ancient histo rians, in mentioning the Wittenagemot, seem to contradict the latter supposition. The members are almost always called the principes, fatrap\u0153, opti mates, magnates, proceres ; terms which seem to suppose an aristocracy, and to exclude the com mons. The boroughs also, from the low state of commerce, were so small and so poor, and the in habitants lived in such dependence on the great men r, that it seems nowise probable they would be admitted as a part of the national councils. The commons are well known to have had no ssiare. in the governments establissied by the Franks, Bur gundians, and other northern nations ; and we may conclude that the Saxons, who remained longer bar barous and uncivilized than those tribes, would ne ver think of conferring such an extraordinary privi lege on trade and industry. The military profession alone was honourable among all those conquerors : The warriors subsisted by their possessions in land : They became considerable by their influence over their vassals, retainers, tenants, and slaves : And it requires strong proof to convince us that they would admit any of a rank so much inferior as the bur gesses, to share with them in the legislative autho rity. Tacitus indeed affirms, that, among the an cient Germans, the consent of all the members of the community was required in every important de liberation ; but he speaks not of representatives ; and this ancient practice, mentioned by the Roman historian, could only have place in small tribes, where every citizen might, without inconvenience, be assembled upon any extraordinary emergency. After principalities became extensive ; after the dif ference of property had formed distinctions more important than those which arose from personal r Brady's Treatise of English Boroughs, p. 3, 4, 5, &c. strength"], [229, "20 j Appendix I APPENDIX I strength and valour, we may conclude, that the national assemblies must have been more limited in their number, and composed only of the more con siderable citizens. But though we must exclude the burgesses, or commons, frpn; the Saxon Wittenagemot, there is some necessity for, supposing that this assembly con sisted of other members than the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the judges or privy council. For as all these, excepting some of the ecclesiastics s, were anciently appointed by the king, had there been no other legislative authority, the royal power had been in a great measure absolute, contrary to the tenor of all the historians, and to the practice of all the northern nations. We may therefore conclude, that the more considerable proprietors of land were, without any election, constituent members of the na tional assembly : There is reason to think that forty hides, or between four and five thousand acres, was the estate requisite for entitling the possessor to this honourable privilege. We find a passage in an an cient author ', by which it appears, that a person of very noble birth, even one allied to the crown, was not esteemed a princeps (the term usually employed by ancient historians, when the Wittenagemot is mentioned) till he had acquired a fortune of that amount. Nor need we imagine that the public council would become disorderly or confused by ad mitting so great a multitude. The landed property of England was probably in few hands during the Saxon times; at least during the latter part of that 5 There is some reason to think that the bilhops were some times chosen by the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the king.

The aristo ciacy, period : And as men had hardly any ambition to attend those public councils, there was no danger of the assembly's becoming too numerous for the dispatch of the little business which was brought be fore them. It is certain, that whatever we may determine concerning the constituent members of the Wittena gemot, in whom, with the king, the legislature resided, the Anglo-Saxon government, in the pe riod preceding the Norman conquest, was become extremely aristocratical: The royal authority was very limited ; the people, even if admitted to that assembly, were of little or no weight and consider ation. We have hints given us in historians, of the great power and riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but happen, after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the king lived at a distance from the provinces, that those great proprietors, who resided on their estates, would much augment their authority over their vassals and retainers, and over all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence the immeasurable power assumed by Harold, Godwin, Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Ed ric, and Alfric, who controlled the authority of the kings, and rendered themselves quite necessary in the government. The two latter, though detested by the people, on account of their joining a foreign enemy, still preserved their power and influence ; and we may therefore conclude, that their authority was founded, not on popularity; but on family rights and possessions. There is one Athelstan mentioned in the reign of the king of that name, who is called alderman of all England, and is said to be half-king ; though the monarch himself was a prince of valour and abilities u. And we find, that in the latter Saxon times, and in these alone, the Hist. Rames. \u00a7 3. p. 387 great"], [231, "APPENDIX I. 205 APp:ndix, i great offices went from father to son, and became in a manner hereditary in the families \". The circumstances attending the invasions of the Danes would also serve much to encrease the power of the principal nobility. Those freebooters made unexpected inroads on all quarters ; and there was a necessity that each county ssiould resist them by its own force, and under the conduct of its own nobi lity and its own magistrates. For the fame reason that a general war, managed by the united efforts of the whole state, commonly augments the power of the crown ; those private wars and inroads turned to the advantage of the aldermen and nobles. Among that military and turbulent people, so averse to commerce and the arts, and so little enured to industry, justice was commonly very ill admini stered, and great oppression and violence seem to have prevailed. These disorders would be encreasecr by the exorbitant power of the aristocracy; and would, in their turn, contribute to encrease it. Men, not daring to rely on the guardianssiip os th\u00ab laws, were obliged to devote themselves to the ser vice of some chieftain, whose orders they followed, even to the disturbance of the government, or the injury of their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them, in return, protection from any insult or in justice by strangers. Hence we find, by the ex tracts which Dr. Brady has given us from Domes day, that almost all the inhabitants, even of towns, had placed themselves under the clientssirp of some particular nobleman, whosepatronagethey purchased by annual payments, and whom they were obliged to consider as their sovereign more than the king * Roger Hoveden, giving the reason why William the Con queror made Cospatric earl of Northumberland, says, Nam ex materno sanguine attinehat ad turn honor iUhls comitatiis.

Men who were of a more considerable rank, but not powerful enough, each to support himself by his own independent authority, entered into formal confederacies with each other, and composed a kind of separate community, which rendered irself formidable to all aggressors. Dr. Hickes has preserved a curious Saxon bond of this kind, which he calls a Sodalitium, and which con tains many particulars characteristical of the man ners and customs of the times z. All the associates are there said to be gentlemen of Cambridgessiire ; and they swear before the holy reliques to observe their confederacy, and to be faithful to each other : They promise to bury any of the associates who dies, in whatever place he had appointed ; to contribute to his funeral charges, and to attend at his inter ment ; and whoever is wanting in this last duty, binds himself to pay a measure of honey. When any of the associates is in danger, and calls for the assistance of his fellows, they promise, besides flying to his succour, to give information to the fteriff; and if he be negligent in protecting the person ex posed to danger, they engage to sevy a fine of one pound upon him : If the president of the society himself be wanting in this particular, he binds him self to pay one pound ; unless he has the reasonable excuse of sickness, or of duty to hrs superior.

If any of the associates who happens to be poor kill a man, the society are to contribute, by a certain proportion, to pay his fine: A mark a-piece if the fine be 700 shillings ; less if the person killed be a clown or ceorle ; the half of that sum again if he be a Welssiman. But where any of the associates kills a man, wilfully and with out provocation, he must himself pay the fine. If any of the associates kill any of his fellows in a like criminal manner, besides paying the usual fine to the relations of the deceased, he must pay eight pounds to the society, or renounce the benefit of it : In which case, they bind themselves, under the pe nalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with him, except in the presence of the king, bissiop, or alderman. There are other regulations to protect themselves and their servants from all injuries, to revenge such as are committed, and to prevent their giving abusive language to each other ; and the fine, which they engage to pay for this last offence, is a measure of honey. It is not to be doubted but a confederacy of this kind must have been a great source of friendssiip and attachment ; when men lived in perpetual danger from enemies, robbers, and oppressors, and received protection chiefly from their personal valour, and from the assistance of their friends or patrons. As animosities were then more violent, connexions were also more intimate, whether voluntary or de rived from blood : The most remote degree of pro pinquity was regarded : An indelible memory of benefits was preserved : Severe vengeance was taken for injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the belt means of future security : And the civil union being weak, many private engagements were contracted in order to supply its place, and to pro cure men that safety which the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to insure to them.

The reason is derived from the excess itself of that liberty. Men must guard themselves at any price against insults and injuries ; and where they receive not protection from the laws and magistrate, they will seek it by submission to superiors, and by herding in some pri vate confederacy which acts under the direction of a powerful leader. And thus all anarchy is the immediate cause of tyranny, if not over the state, at least over many of the individuals. Security was provided by the Saxon laws to all members of the Wittenagemot, both in going and returning, except they were notorious thieves and robbers. The German Saxons, as the other nations of that continent, were divided into three ranks of men, the noble, the free, and the slaves \\ This distinc tion they brought over with them into Britain. The nobles were called thanes ; and were of two kinds, the king's thanes and lesser thanes. The lat ter seem to have been dependent on the former ; and to have received lands, for which they paid rent, ser vices, or attendance in peace and war b. We know of no tide which raised any one to the rank of thane except noble birth and the possession of land. The former was always much regarded by all the Ger man nations, even in their most barbarous state ; and as the Saxon nobility, having little credit, could scarcely burthen their estates with much debt, and as the commons had little trade or industry by which * K'ithard, ftist. lib. +. b Spelm. Feus and Tenures, p. 40. 8 they"], [235, "APPENDIX. I. 209 Appendix I. they could accumulate riches, these two ranks of men, even though they were not separated by po sitive laws, might remain long distinct, and the noble families continue many ages in opulence and splen dour. There were no middle ranks of men, that could gradually mix with their superiors, and insen sibly procure to themselves honour and distinction. If by any extraordinary accident a mean person ac quired riches, a circumdance so singular made him be known and remarked ; he became the object of envy, as well as of indignation, to all the nobles ; he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired ; and he would find it impossible to protect himself from oppression, except by courting the pa tronage of some great chieftain, and paying a large price for his safety. There are two statutes among the Saxon laws which seem calculated to confound those different ranks of men ; that of Athelstan, by which a mer chant, who had made three long sea- voyages on his own account, was entitled to the quality of Thanec ; and that of the fame prince, by which a ceorle or husoandman, who had been able to purchase five hides of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall, and a bell, was raised to the same distinction11. But the opportunities were so few, by which a merchant or ceorle could thus exalt himself above his rank, that the law could never overcome the reigning pre judices ; the distinction between noble and base blood would still be indelible ; and the well-born thanes would entertain the highest contempt for those legal and factitious ones. Though we are not informed of any of these circumstances by ancient historians, they are so much founded on the nature of things, that we may admit them as a necessary and infallible consequence of the situation of the kingdom during those ages. c Wilkins, p. 71. \" Selden, Titles of Honour, p. 515.

Malmesoury tells us * that the great dis tinction between the Anglo-Saxon nobility, and the French or Norman, was, that the latter built mag nificent and stately castles ; whereas the former con sumed their immense fortunes in riot and hospitality, and in mean houses. We may thence infer that the arts in general were much less advanced in Eng land than in France ; a greater number of idle ser vants and retainers lived about the great families ; and as these, even in France, were powerful enough to disturb the execution of the laws, we may judge of the authority acquired by the aristocracy in Eng land. When earl Godwin besieged the Confessor in London, he summoned from all parts his husearles, or housecoorles and retainers, and thereby con strained his sovereign to accept of the conditions which he was pleased to impose upon him. The lower rank of freemen were denominated ceorles among the Anglo-Saxons ; and, where they were industrious, they were chiefly employed in hus bandry : Whence a ceorle and a husoandman be came in a manner synonymous terms.

For there is little mention of leases among the Anglo-Saxons : The pride of the nobi lity, together with the general ignorance of writing, must have rendered those contracts very rare, and must have kept the husoandmen in a dependent condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in kind '. But the most numerous rank by far in the com munity seems to have been the slaves or villains, who were the property of their lords, and were conse quently incapable themselves of possessing any pro perty. Dr. Brady assures uSj from a survey of Domesday-book lc, that, in all the counties of Eng land, the far greater part of the land was occupied by them, and that the husoandmen, and still more the socmen, who were tenants that could not be re moved at pleasure, were very few in comparison. This was not the case with the German nations, as far as we can collect from the account given us by- Tacitus. The perpetual wars in the Heptarchy, and the depredations of the Danes, seem to have been the cause of this great alteration with the An glo-Saxons. Prisoners taken in battle, or carried off in the frequent inroads, were then reduced to slavery ; and became, by right of war1, entireJy at the disposal of their lords. Great property in the nobles, especially if joined to an irregular admini stration of justice, naturally favours the power of the aristocracy ; but still more so, if the practice of sla* very be admitted, and has become very common.

This institution must have had a very contrary effect to that which was intended, and must have procured robbers a sure protection on the lands of such noble men as did not sincerely mean to discourage crimes and violence. But though the general strain of the Anglo-Saxon government seems to have become aristocratical, there were still considerable remains of the ancient democracy, which were not indeed sufficient to pro tect the lowest of the people, without the patronage of some great lord, but might give security, and even some degree of dignity, to the gentry or in ferior nobility.

It was not unusual to add to the deed an imprecation on all such as ssiould be guilty of that crime y. Among a people, who lived in so simple a man ner as the Anglo-Saxons, the judicial power is ah ways of greater importance than the legislative. There were few or no taxes imposed1 by the states : There were few statutes enacted ; and the nation was less governed by laws than by customs, which ad mitted a great latitude of interpretation. Though it ssiould, therefore, be allowed that the Wittena gemot was altogether composed of the principal nobility, the county-courts, where all the freeholders were admitted, and which regulated all the daily occurrences of life, formed a wide basis for the go vernment, and were no contemptible checks on the aristocracy. But there is another power still more important than either the judicial or legislative ; to wit, the power of injuring or serving by immediate force and violence, for which it is difficult to obtain redress in courts of justice. In all extensive go- vernments,where the execution of the laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of the prin- cipal nobility ; and the degree of it which prevails, cannot be determined so much by the public statutes, as by small incidents in history, by particular cus- toms, and sometimes by the reason and nature of things. The Highlands of Scotland have long been entitled by law to every privilege of British subjects; but it was not till very lately that the common peo- ple could in fact enjoy these privileges. The powers of all the members of the Anglo- Saxon government are disputed among historians and antiquaries : The extreme obscurity of the sub- ject, even though faction had never entered into the question, would naturally have begotten those con- troversies. But the great influence of the lords over y Hickes, Dissert. Ep:st. their"], [241, "APPENDIX I, 215 Appendix I. Criminal Law. their slaves and tenants, the cUentssiip of the burghers, the total want of a middling rank of men, the extent of the monarchy, the loose execution of the laws, the continued disorders and convulsions of the state; all these circumstances evince that the Anglo-Saxon government became at last extremely aristocratical ; and the events, during the period immediately pre ceding the conquest, confirm this inference or con jecture. Both the punissiments inflicted by the Anglo- Saxon courts of judicature, and the methods of proof employed in all causes, appear somewhat sin gular, and are very different from those which pre vail at present among all civilized nations. We must conceive that the ancient Germans were little removed from the original state of nature : The social confederacy among them was more martial than civil : They had chiefly in view the means of attack or defence against public enemies, not those of protection against their fellow-citizens : Their possessions were so slender and so equal, that they were not exposed to great danger ; and the natural bravery of the people made every man trust to himself, and to his particular friends, for his defence or venge ance. This defect in the political union drew much closer the knot of particular confederacies : An in sult upon any man was regarded by all his relations and associates as a common injury : They were bound by honour as well as by a sense of common interest, to revenge his death, or any violence which he had suffered: They retaliated on the aggressor by like acts of violence ; and if he were protected, as was natural and usual, by his own clan, the quar rel was spread still wider, and bred endless disorders in the nation. The Frisians, a tribe of the Germans, had never advanced beyond this wild and imperfect stare of society; and the right of private revenge still re- P 4 mained"], [242, "216 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Appendix I. mained among them unlimited and uncontroled z. But the other German nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one step farther towards completing the political or civil union. Though it still continued to be an indispensable point of honour for every clan to revenge the death or injury of a member, the magistrate had acquired a right of interposing in the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference. He obliged the person maimed or injured, and the re lations of one killed, to accept of a present from the aggressor and his relations *, as a compensation for the injury b, and to drop all further prosecution of revenge. That the accommodation of one quarrel might not be the source of more, this present was fixed and certain, according to the rank ofthe person killed or injured, and was commonly paid in cattle, the chief property of those rude and uncultivated nations. A present of this kind gratified the revenge of the injured family, by the loss which the aggressor suffered : It satisfied their pride, by the submission which it expressed : It diminissied their regret for the loss or injury of a kinsman, by their acquisition of new property: And thus general peace was for a moment restored to the society c. But when the German nations had been settled some time in the provinces of the Roman empire, they made still another step towards a more culti vated life, and their criminal justice gradually im proved and refined itself. The magistrate, whose office it was to guard public peace, and to suppress private animosities, conceived himself to be injured by every injury done to. any of his people ; and be sides the compensation to the person who suffered, z LL.

When this idea, which is so natural, was once sug gested, it was willingly received both by sovereign and people. The numerous fines which were le vied, augmented the revenue of the king : And the people were sensible that he would be more vigilant in interposing with his good offices, when he reaped such immediate advantage from them : and that injuries would be less frequent, when, besides com pensation to the person injured, they were exposed to this additional penalty \\ This ssiort abstract contains the history ofthe cri minal jurisprudence of the northern nations for se veral centuries. The state of England in this parti cular, during the period of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the collection of ancient laws, pub lissied by Lambard and Wilkins. The chief purport of these laws is not to prevent or entirely lup press private quarrels, which the legislator knew to be impossible, but only to regulate and moderate them. The laws of Alfred enjoin, that if any one know that his enemy or aggressor, after doing him an injury, resolves to keep within his own house, and his own lands', he ssiall not fight him till he re quire compensation for the injury. If he be strong enough to besiege him in his house, he may do it for seven days without attacking him; and if the ag gressor be willing, during that time, to surrender himself and his arms, his adversary may detain him thirty days ; but is afterwards obliged to restore him safe to his kindred, and be content with the compen~ 6 Besides paying money to the relations of the deceased and to the king, the murderer was also obliged to pay the master of a slave or vassal a sum as the compensation for his loss.

If the criminal fly to the temple, that sane- tuary must not be violated. Where the assailant has not force sufficient to besiege the criminal in his house, he must apply to the alderman for assist- ance ; and if the alderman refuse aid, the assailant must have recourse to the king : And he is not al- lowed to assault the house, till after this supreme magistrate has refused assistance. If any one meet with his enemy, and be ignorant that he was re- solved to keep within his own lands, he must, be- fore he attack him, require him to surrender him- self prisoner, and deliver up his arms ; in which case he may detain him thirty days : But if he refuse to deliver up his arms, it is then lawful to fight him. A slave may fight in his master's quarrel : A father may fight in his son's with any one, except with his master f. It was enacted by King Ina, that no man ssiould take revenge for an injury till he had first demand ed compensation, and had been refused it S. King Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions the general misery occasioned by the mul tiplicity of private feuds and battles ; and he esta blissies several expedients for remedying this griev ance. Fie ordains, that if any one commit murder, he may, with the assistance of his kindred, pay within a twelvemonth the sine of his crime ; and if they abandon him, he ssiall alone sustain the deadly send or quarrel with the kindred of the murdered person : His own kindred are free from the feud, but on condition that they neither converse with the cri minal, nor supply him with meat or other necessaries : If any of them, aster renouncing him, receive him into their house, or give him assistance, they are finable to the king, and are involved in the feud.

It is also ordained, that the fine for murder shall never be remitted by the king ' ; and that no criminal shall be killed who flies to the church, or any of the king's towns k ; and the king himself declares, that his house shall give no pro tection to murderers, till they have satisfied the church by their penance, and the kindred of the deceased, by making compensation K The method appointed for transacting this composition is found in the fame law m. These attempts of Edmond, to contract and di minissi the feuds, were contrary to the ancient spirit ofthe northern barbarians, and were a step towards a more regular administration of justice. By the Salic law, any man might, by a public declaration, exempt himself from his family quarrels : But then he was considered by the law as no longer belonging to the family ; and he was deprived of all right of succession, as the punissiment of his cowardice n. The price of the king's head, or his weregild, as it was then called, was by law 30,000 thrifmas, near 1300 pounds of present money. The price of the prince's head was 1 5,000 thrifmas ; that of a bissiop's or alderman's 8000; a ssieriff's 4000; a thane's or clergyman's 2000 ; a ceorle's 266. These prices were fixed by the laws of the Angles. By the Mercian law, the price of a ceorle's head was 200 shillings ; that of a thane's six times as much ; that of a king's fix times more \u00b0.

Some antiquarians i have thought that these com pensations were only given for man-slaughter, not for wilful murder : But no such distinction appears in the laws ; and it is contradicted by the practice of all the other barbarous nations ', by that of the ancient Germans % and by that curious monument above mentioned, of Saxon antiquity, preserved by Hickes. There is indeed a law of Alfred's, which makes wilful murder capital ' ; but this seems only to have been an attempt of that great legislator towards establissiing a better police in the kingdom, and it probably remained without execution. By the laws of the fame prince, a conspiracy against the life of the king might be redeemed by a fine u. The price of all kinds of wounds was likewise fixed by the Saxon laws : A wound of an inch long under the hair, was paid with one shilling : One of a like size in the face two shillings : Thirty ssiillings for the loss of an ear, and so forth \". There seems not to have been any difference made, according to the dignity of the person. By the law of Ethel bert, any one who committed adultery with his neighbour's wife was obliged to pay him a fine, and buy him another wife \". These institutions are not peculiar to the ancient Germans. They seem to be the necessary progress of criminal jurisprudence among every free people, where the will of the sovereign is not implicitly obeyed.

Rules of proof. t If the manner of punissiing crimes among the Anglo-Saxons appear singular, the proofs were not less so ; and were also the natural result of the situa tion of those people. Whatever we may imagine concerning the usual truth and sincerity of men who live in a rude and barbarous state, there is much more falsehood, and even perjury, among them, than among civilized nations : Virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated reason, never flourissies to any degree, nor is founded on steady principles of honour, except where a good education becomes general ; and where men are taught the pernicious consequences of vice, trea chery, and immorality. Even superstition, though more prevalent among ignorant nations, is but a poor supply for the defects in knowledge and edu cation : Our European ancestors, who employed every moment the expedient of swearing on extra ordinary crosses and reliques, were less honourable in all engagements than their posterity, who, from experience, have omitted those ineffectual securities. This general proneness to perjury was much en creased bv the usual want of discernment in judges, who could not discuss an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number, not weigh, the testimony of the witnesses8. Hence the ridiculous practice of obliging men to bring compurgators, who, as they did not pretend to know any thing of the fact, expressed upon oath, that they believed the person spoke true ; and these compurgators were in some cases multiplied to the number of three hundred h. The practice also of single combat was employed by most nations on the continent as a remedy against false evidence ' ; and though it was frequently drop- 8 Sometimes the laws fixed easy general rules for weighing the credibility of witnesses.

It became at last a species of jurisprudence : The cases were determined by law, in which the party might chal lenge his adversary, or the witnesses, or the judge himself1 : And though these customs were absurd, they were rather an improvement on the methods of trial which had formerly been practised among those barbarous nations, and which still prevailed among the Anglo-Saxons. When any controversy about a fact became too intricate for those ignorant judges to unravel, they had recourse to what they called the judgment of God ; that is, to fortune : Their methods of con sulting this oracle were various. One of them was the decision by the cross : It was practised in this manner : When a person was accused of any crime, he first cleared himself by oath, and he was attended by eleven compurgators. He next took two pieces of wood, one of which was marked with the sign of the cross, and wrapping both up in wool, he placed them on the altar, or on some celebrated relique. After solemn prayers for the success of the experi ment, a priest, or, in his stead, some unexperienced youth, took up one of the pieces of wood, and if he happened upon that which was marked with the figure of a cross, the person was pronounced inno cent ; if otherwise, guilty m. This practice, as it arose from superstition, was abolissied by it in France. The emperor, Lewis the Debonnaire, pro hibited that method of trial, not because it was un certain, but lest that sacred figure, says he, ot the cross ssiould be prostituted in common disputes and controversies\". kLL.

The for mer was appropriated to the common people ; the latter to the nobility. The water or iron was con secrated by many prayers, masses, fastings, and ex orcisms \u00b0 ; after which the person accused either took up a stone sunk in the water p to a certain depth, or carried the iron to a certain distance; and his hand being wrapped up, and the covering scaled for three days, if there appeared, on examin ing it, no marks of burning, he was pronounced innocent ; if otherwise, guilty q. The trial by cold water was different : The person was thrown into consecrated water ; if he swam, he was guilty ; if he funk, innocent r. It is difficult for us to conceive how any innocent person could ever escape by the one trial, or any criminal be convicted by the other. But there was another usage admirably calculated for allowing every criminal to escape who had con fidence enough to try it. A consecrated cake, called a corsned, was produced ; which if the per son could swallow and digest, he was pronounced innocent s. The feudal law, if it had place at all among the Anglo-Saxons, which is doubtful, was not certainly extended over all the landed property, and was not attended with those consequences of homage, re liefs ', worssiip, marriage, and other burthens, which were inseparable from it in the kingdoms of the continent.

The king and nobility had some military tenants, who were called Sithoun-men 2. And there were some lands annexed to the office of aldermen, and to other offices; but these probably were not of great extent, and were possessed only during pleasure, as in the commencement ofthe feudal law in other countries of Europe. The revenue ofthe king seems to have consisted chiefly in his demesnes, which were large ; and in the tolls and imposts which he probably levied at discretion on the boroughs and sea-ports that lay within his demesnes.

The Saxon pound, as likewise that which was coined for some centuries after the conquest, was near three times the weight of our present money : There were forty-eight shillings in the pound, and five pence in a ssiilling A ; consequently a Saxon ssiilling was near a fifth heavier than ours, and a Saxon penny near three times as heavy \". As to the value of money in those times, compared to commodities, there are some, though not very cer tain means of computation. A ssieep, by the laws of Athelstan, was estimated at a ssiilling ; that is, fifteen pence of our money. The fleece was two fifths of the value ofthe whole ssieep f ; much above its present estimation ; and the reason probably was, that the Saxons, like the antients, were little ac- quainted with any clothing but what was made of wool. Silk aud cotton were quite unknown : Linen was not much used. An ox was computed at six times the value of a sheep; a cow at four S. If we suppose that the cattle in that age, from the defects in husbandry, were not so large as they are at pre sent in England, we may compute that money was then near ten times of greater value. A horse was valued at about thirty-six shillings of our money, or thirty Saxon shillings h ; a mare a third less. A man at three pounds \\ The board wages of a child the first year was eight shillings, together with a cow's pasture in summer, and an ox's in winter k.

In Athelstan's time a ram was valued at a ssiilling, or fourpence Saxon4. The tenants of Shirebum were obliged, at their choice, to pay either six pence, or four hens'. About 1232, the abbot of St. Alban's, going on a journey, hired seven handsome stout horses ; and agreed, if any of them died on the road, to pay the owner 30 ssiil lings a piece of our present money !. It is to be remarked, that in all ancient times the raising of corn, especially wheat, being a species of manu factory, that commodity always bore a higher price, compared to cattle, than it does in our times'. The Saxon Chronicle tells us u, that in the reign of Edward the Confessor there was the most terrible fa mine ever known ; insomuch that a quarter of wheat rose to sixty pennies, or fifteen shillings of our pre sent money.

Money in this last period was nearly of the fame value as in our time. These severe famines are a certain proof of bad husoandry. On the whole there are three things to be con- sidered, wherever a sum of money is mentioned in ancient times. First, the change of denomination, by which a pound has been reduced to the third part of its ancient weight in silver. Secondly, the change in value by the greater plenty of money, which has reduced the fame weight of silver to ten times less value, compared to commodities ; and consequently a pound sterling to the thirtieth part of the ancient value. Thirdly, the fewer people and less industry, which were then to be found in everyEuropean king- dom. This circumstance made even the thirtieth part of the sum more difficult to levy, and caused any sum to have more than thirty times greater weight and influence, both abroad and at home, than in our times ; in the fame manner that a sum, a hundred thousand pounds, for instance, is at pre- sent more difficult to levy in a small state, such as Bavaria, and can produce greater effects on such a small community, than on England. This last dif- ference is not easy to be calculated : But allowing that England has now six times more industry, and three times more people than it had at the conquest, and for some reigns after that period, we are upon that supposition to conceive, taking all circumstances together, every sum of money mentioned by histo- rians, as if it were multiplied more than a hundred fold above a sum of the same denomination at present.

IV. hazardous enterprise. But there were several vices in the Anglo Saxon constitution, which rendered it difficult for the Englissi to defend their liberties in so critical an emergency. The people had in a great measure lost all national pride and spirit, by their recent and long subjection to the Danes ; and as Canute had, in the course of his administration, much abated the rigours of conquest, and had go- verned them equitably by their own laws, they re- garded with the less terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke, and deemed the inconveniencies of submission less formidable than those of bloodssied, war, and resistance. Their attachment also to the ancient royal family had been much weakened, by their ha- bits of submission to the Danissi princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their acquiescence in his usurpation. And as they had long been accustomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the only heir of the Saxon line, as unsit to govern them even in times of order and tranquillity ; they could entertain small hopes of his being able to repair such great losses as they had sustained, or to withstand the victorious arms of the duke of Normandy. That they might not, however, be altogether wanting to themselves in this extreme necessity, the Englissi took some steps towards adjusting their dis jointed government, and uniting themselves against the common enemy. The two potent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who had fled to London with the remains of the broken army, took the lead on this occasion : In concert with Stigand, archbisoop of Canterbury, a man possessed of great authority and of ample revenues, they proclaimed Edgar, and en- deavoured to put the people in a posture of defence, and encourage them to resist the Normans b.

William, that his enemies might have no leisure to recover from their consternation, or unite their counsels, immediately put himself in motion after his victory, and resolved to prosecute an enterprise, which nothing but celerity and vigour could render finally successful. His first attempt was against Romney, whose inhabitants he severely punished, on account of their cruel treatment of some Norman seamen and soldiers, who had been carried thither by stress of weather, or by a mistake in their course c : And foreseeing that his conquessiof England might still be attended with manydifficulties and with much opposition, he deemed it necessary, before he ssiould advance farther into the country, to make himself master of Dover, which would both secure him a retreat in case of adverse fortune, and afford him a safe landing-place for such supplies as might be re quisite for pussiing his advantages. The terror dif fused by his victory at Hastings was so grear, that the garrison of Dover, though numerous and well provided, immediately capitulated; and as the Nor mans, rustling in to take possession of the town, hastily set fire to some of the houses, William, de sirous to conciliate the minds of the Englissi by an appearance of lenity and justice, made compensation to the inhabitants for their losses \".

Submission of the Eng. liQi. the people, began to declare in his favour ; and as most of the bissiops and dignified clergymen were even then Frenchmen or Normans, the pope's bull, by which his enterprise was avowed and hallowed, was now openly insisted on as a reason for general submission. The superior learning of those prelates which, during the Confessor's reign, had raised them above the ignorant Saxons, made their opinions be received with implicit faith ; and a young prince like Edgar, whose capacity was deemed so mean, was but ill qualified to resist the impression which they made on the minds of the people. A repulse which a body of Londoners received from five hun dred Norman horse, renewed in the city the terror of the great defeat at Hastings ; the easy submission of all the inhabitants of Kent was an additional dis couragement to them ; the burning of Southwark before their eyes, made them dread a like fate to their own city ; and no man any longer entertained thoughts but of immediate safety and of self-pre servation. Even the earls Edwin and Morcar, in despair of making effectual resistance, retired with their troops to their own provinces ; and the people thenceforth disposed themselves unanimously to yield to the victor. As soon as he passed the Thames at Wallingford, and reached Berkhamstead, Stigand the primate made submissions to him : Before he came within sight of the city, all the chief nobility, and Edgar Atheling himself\", the new-elected king, came into his camp, and declared their intention of yielding to his authority e.

The king appeared solicitous to unite, in an amicable manner, the Normans and the Englissi, by intermarriages and alliances; and all his new subjects who approached his person were received with affability and regard. No signs of suspicion appeared, not even towards Edgar Athel ing, the heir of the ancient royal family, whom William confirmed in the honours of earl of Oxford, conferred on him by Harold, and whom he affected to treat with the highest kindness, as nephew to the Confessor, his great friend and benefactor. Though he confiscated the estates of Harold, and of those who had fought in the battle of Hastings on the side of that prince, whom he represented as an usurper, he seemed willing to admit of every plausible excuse for past opposition to his pretensions, and he re ceived many into favour who had carried arms against him. He confirmed the liberties and im munities of London and the other cities of England ; and appeared desirous of replacing every thing on ancient establissiments. In his whole administration he bore the semblance of the lawful prince, not of the conqueror ; and the Englissi began to flatter themselves that they had changed, not the form of their government, but the succession only of their sovereigns, a matter which gave them small con cern. The better to reconcile his new subjects to his authority, William made a progress through some parts of England; and besides a splendid court and majestic presence, which overawed the people, already struck with his military fame, the appear ance of his clemency and justice gained the appro bation of the wise, attentive to the first steps of their new sovereign.

He disarmed the city of Lon don and other places, which appeared most warlike and populous ; and building citadels in that capital, as well as in Winchester, Hereford, and the cities best situated for commanding the kingdom, he quartered Norman soldiers in all of them, and left no where any power able to resist or oppose him. He bestowed the forfeited estates on the most emi nent of his captains, and establissied funds for the payment of his soldiers. And thus, while his civil administration carried the face of a legal magistrate, his military institutions were those of a master and tyrant ; at least of one who reserved to himself, whenever he pleased, the power of assuming that character.\" CHAP. IV. io6j. By this mixture, however, of vigour and lenity, he had so soothed the minds of the Englissi, that he thought he might safely revisit his native country, and enjoy the triumph and congratulation of his ancient subjects. He left the administration in the hands of his uterine brother, Odo bissiop of Baieux, and of William Fitz Oiberne. That their authority might be exposed to less danger, he carried over with him all the most considerable nobility of Eng land, who, while they served to grace his court by their presence and magnificent retinues, were in re ality hostages for the fidelity of the nation. Among these were Edgar Atheling, Stigand the primate, the earls Edwin and Morcar, Waltheof, the son of the brave earl Siward, with others eminent for the greatness of their fortunes and families, or for their ecclesiastical and civil dignities. He was visited at the abbey of Fescamp, where he resided during some time, by Rodulph, uncle to the king of France, and by many powerful princes and nobles, who, having contributed to his enterprise, were de sirous of participating in the joy and advantages of its success.

William of Poictiers, a Norman historian3, who was present, speaks with admiration of the beauty of their persons, the size and workmanship of their silver plate, the costliness of their embroideries, an art in which the Englissi then excelled; and he expresseshimself in such terms, as tend much to exalt our idea of the opulence and cultivation of the people '. But though every thing bore the face of joy and festivity, and William him self treated his new courtiers with great appearance of kindness, it was impossible altogether to prevent the insolence ofthe Normans ; and the Englissi no bles derived little satisfaction from those entertain ments, where they considered themselves as led in triumph by their ostentatious conqueror. In England affairs took still a worse turn during the absence of the sovereign. Discontents and complaints multiplied every where ; secret conspira cies were entered into against the government ; hos tilities were already begun in many places ; and every thing seemed to menace a revolution, as rapid as that which had placed William on the throne. The historian above mentioned, who is a panegyrist of his master, throws the blame entirely on the fickle and mutinous disposition ofthe Englissi, and highly celebrates the justice and lenity of Odo's and Fitz Osoerne's administration\".

It is evident, that the chief reason of this altera- tion in the sentiments of the English, must be ascribed to the departure of William, who was alone able to curb the violence of his captains, and to overawe the mutinies of the people. Nothing indeed appears more strange, than that this prince* in less than three months after the conquest of a great, warlike, and turbulent nation, ssiould absent himself, in order to revisit his own country, which remained in profound tranquillity, and was not me naced by any of its neighbours; and ssiould so long leave his jealous subjects at the mercy of an insolent and licentious army. Were we not assured of the solidity of his genius, and the good sense displayed in all other circumstances of his conduct, we might ascribe this measure to a vain ostentation, which rendered him impatient to display his pomp and magnificence among his ancient subjects. It is therefore more natural to believe, that in so extra ordinary a step he was guided by a concealed policy ; and that, though he had thought proper at first to allure the people to submission by the semblance of a legal administration, he found that he could neir ther satisfy his rapacious captains, nor secure his unstable government, without farther exerting the rights of conquest, and seizing the possessions of the Englissi. In order to have a pretext for this vio lence, he endeavoured, without discovering his in- tentions, to provoke and allure them into insurrec- tions, which he thought, could never prove dan- gerous, while he detained all the principal nobility in Normandy, while a gi'eat and victorious army w Order.

But whether we are to account for that measure lions!\" from the king's vanity or from his policy, it was the immediate cause of all the calamities which the Englissi endured during this and the subsequent reigns, and gave rise to those mutual jealousies and animosities between them and the Normans, which were never appeased till a long tract of time had gradually united the two nations, and made them one people. The inhabitants of Kent, who had first submitted to the Conqueror, were the first that attempted to throw off the yoke; and in confederacy with Eustace, count of Bologne, who had also been disgusted by the Normans, they made an attempt, though without success, on the garrison of Dover \\ Edric the Forester, whose possessions lay on the banks of the Severne, being provoked at the depre dations of some Norman captains in his neighbour hood, formed an alliance with Blethyn and Rowallan, two Welssi princes ; and endeavoured, with their assistance, to repel force by force y. But though these open hostilities were not very considerable, the disaffection was general among the English, who had become sensible, though too late, of their de fenceless condition, and began already to experience those insults and injuries which a nation must al ways expect, that allows itself to be reduced to that abject situation.

The king, informed of these dangerous discon tents, hastened over to England ; and by his pre sence, and the vigorous measures which he pursued, disconcerted all the schemes of the conspirators. Such of them as had been more violent in their mutiny, betrayed their guilt by flying, or concealing thmselves ; and the confiscation of their estates, while it encreafed the number of malcontents, both enabled William to gratify farther the rapacity of his Norman captains, and gave them the prospect of new forfeitures and attainders. The king began to regard all his Englissi subjects as inveterate and irreclaimable enemies ; and thenceforth either em- braced, or was more fully confirmed in the resolution of seizing their possessions, and of reducing them to the most abject slavery. Though the natural vio lence and severity of his temper made him incapable of feeling any remorse in the execution of this ty rannical purpose, he had art enough to conceal his intention, and to preserve still some appearance of justice in his oppressions. He ordered all the Englissi, who had been arbitrarily expelled by the Normans during his absence, to be restored to their estates - : But at the fame time he imposed a general tax on the people, that of Danegelt, which had been abo lissied by the Confessor, and which had always been extremely odious to the nation \\ As the vigilance of William overawed the mal contents, their insurrections were more the result of an impatient humour in the people, than of any 2 Chron.

The inhabitants of Exeter, instigated by Githa, mother to king Harold, refused to admit a Norman garrison, and betaking themselves to arms, were strengthened by the accession ofthe neighbour ing inhabitants of Devonssiire and Cornwal b. The king hastened with his forces to chastise this revolt ; and on his approach, the wiser and more considerable citizens, sensible of the unequal contest, persuaded the people to submit, and to deliver hostages for their obedience. A sudden mutiny of the populace broke this agreement ; and William, appearing be fore the walls, ordered the eyes of one ofthe hostages to be put out, as an earnest of that severity which the rebels must expect if they persevered in their re volt c. The inhabitants were anew seized with terror, and surrendering at discretion, threw themselves at the king's feet, and supplicated his clemency and forgiveness.

Githa escaped with her treasures to Flanders. The malcontents of Cornwal imitated the example of Exeter, and, met with like treatment : And the king, having built a citadel in that city, which he put under the command of Baldwin, son of earl Gil bert, returned to Winchelier, arid dispersed his army into their quarters. He was here joined by his wife Matilda, who had not before visited England, and whom he now ordered to be crowned by archbissiop Aldred.

But though the king appeared thus fortunate, both in public and domestic life, the discontents of his Englissi subjects augmented daily ; and the inju ries committed and suffered on both sides, ren dered the quarrel between them and the Nor mans absolutely incurable. The insolence of vic torious masters, dispersed throughout the king dom, seemed intolerable to the natives ; and where ever they found the Normans, separate or assembled in small bodies, they secretly set upon them, and gratified their vengeance by the slaughter of their enemies. But an insurrection in. the north drew thither the general attention, and seemed to threaten more important consequences. Edwin and Morcar appeared at the head of this rebellion ; and these po tent noblemen, before they took arms, stipulated for foreign succours, from their nephew Blethyn prince of North Wales, from Malcolm king of Scotland, and from Sweyn king of Denmark. Be sides the general discontent which had seized the Englissi, the two earls were incited to this revolt by private injuries. William, in order to insure them to his interests, had, on his accession, promised his daughter in marriage to Edwin \u2022, but either he had never serioufly intended to perform this engagement, or, having changed his plan of administration in England from clemency to rigour, he thought it was to little purpose, if he gained one family, while he enraged the whole nation.

These, planted throughout the whole country, and in pos session ofthe military power, left Edwin and Mor car, whom he pretended to spare, destitute of all support, and ready to fall, whenever he ssiould think proper to command their ruin. A peace which he made with Malcolm, who did him homage for Cum berland, seemed at the same time to deprive them of all prospect of foreign assistance '.

They observed, that no Englissiman possessed his confidence, or was entrusted with any command or authority ; and that the strangers, whom a rigorous discipline could have but ill re strained, were encouraged in their insolence and ty ranny against them. The easy submission of the kingdom on its first invasion had exposed the na tives to contempt ; the subsequent proofs of their animosity and resentment had made them the object of hatred ; and they were now deprived of every expedient by which they could hope to make them selves either regarded or beloved by their sovereign. Impressed with the sense of this dismal situation, many Englissimen fled into foreign countries, with an intention of passing their lives abroad free from oppression, or of returning on a favourable oppor tunity to assist their friends in the recovery of their native liberties k.

They were 1068. well received by Malcolm, who soon after espoused Margaret the eldest sister ; and partly with a view of strengthening his kingdom by the accession of so many strangers, partly in hopes of employing them against the growing power of William, he gave great countenance to all the English exiles. Many of them settled there ; and laid the foundation of families which afterwards made a figure in that country. While the English suffered under these oppres- sions, even the foreigners were not much at their ease; but finding themselves surrounded on all hands by enraged enemies, who took every advantage against them, and menaced them with still more bloody effects of the public resentment, they began to wish again for the tranquillity and security of their native country. Hugh de Grentmesnil, and Hum- phry de Teliol, though entrusted with great com- mands, desired to be dismissed the service ; and some others imitated their example : A desertion which was highly resented by the king, and which he pu- nished by the confiscation of all their possessions in England k. But William's bounty to his followers could not fail of alluring many new adventurers into his service ; and the rage of the vanquished English served only to excite the attention ot the king and those warlike chiefs, and keep them in readiness to suppress every commencement of domestic re- bellion or foreign invasion. It was not long before they found occupation for New m. their prowess and military conduct.

They landed in Devonssiire; but found Brian, son of the count of Britanny, at the head of some foreign troops, ready to oppose them ; and being defeated in several actions, they were obliged to retreat to their ships, and to return with great loss to Ireland1. The efforts of the Normans were now directed to the north, where affairs had fallen into the utmost confusion. The more impatient of the Northumbrians had attacked Robert de Comyn, who was appointed governor of Durham ; and gaining the advantage over him from his negligence, they put him to death in that city, with seven hundred of his followers m. This success animated the inhabitants of York, who, rising in arms, slew Robert Fitz-Rich?rd their governor n ; and besieged in the castle William Mallet, on whom the command now devolved. A little after, the Danissi troops landed from 300 vessels : Osoerne, brother to king Sweyn, was entrusted with the com mand of these forces, and he was accompanied by Harold and Canute, two sons of that monarch, Edgar Atheling appeared from Scotland, and brought along with him Cospatrick, Waltheof, Si ward, Bearne, Merleswain, Adelin, and other lead ers, who, partly from the hopes which they gave of Scottissi succours, partly from their authority in those parts, easily persuaded the warlike and dis contented Northumbrians to join the insurrection.

The flames, spreading into the neighbouring streets, reduced the whole city to assies : The enraged inhabitants, aided by the Danes, took advantage of the confusion to attack the castle, which they carried by assault ; and the garrison, to the number of 3000 men, was put to the sword without mercy \u00b0. This success proved a signal to many other parts of England, and gave the people an opportunity of showing their malevolence to the Normans. Here ward, a nobleman in East-Anglia, celebrated for va lour, assembled his followers, and taking shelter in the Isle of Ely, made inroads on all the neighbour. ing country p. The Englissi in the counties of So merset and Dorset rose in arms, and assaulted Mont acute the Norman governor ; while the inhabitants of Cornwal and Devon invested Exeter, which from the memory of William's clemency still remained faithful to him. Edric the Forester, calling in the assistance of the Welssi, laid siege to Shrewsoury, and made head against earl Brient and Fitz-Osoerne, who commanded in those quarters s. The English, every where repenting their former easy submission, seemed determined to make by concert one great effort for the recovery of their liberties, and for the expulsion of their oppressors. William, undismayed amidst this scene of con fusion, assembled his forces, and animating them with the prospect of new confiscations and forfeitures, he marched against the rebels in the north, whom he regarded as the most formidable, and whose de feat he knew would strike a terror into all the other malcontents.

Waltheof, who long defended York with great courage, was allured with this ap pearance of clemency ; and as William knew how to esteem valour even in an enemy, that nobleman had no reason to repent of this confidence s. Even Edric, compelled by necessity, submitted to the Conqueror, and received forgiveness, which was soon after followed by some degree of trust and fa vour. Malcolm, coming too late to support his confederates, was constrained to retire ; and all the English rebels in other parts, except Hereward, who still kept in his fastnesses, dispersed themselves, and left the Normans undisputed masters of the kingdom.

But the seeming clemency of William towards the Englissi leaders proceeded only from artifice, or from his esteem of individuals : His heart was hardened against all compassion towards the people ; and he scrupled no measure, however violent or se vere, which seemed requisite to support his plan of tyrannical administration.

As power naturally follows property, this revo- imrociuc lution alone gave great security to the foreigners ; feu'daUaw. but William, by the new institutions which he esta blished, took also care to retain for ever the military authority in those hands which had enabled him to subdue the kingdom. He introduced into England the feudal law, which he found established in France /-~ and Normandy, and which, during that age, was the foundation both of the stability and of the dis orders in most of the monarchial governments of Europe. He divided all the lands of England, with very few exceptions, besides the royal demesnes, into baronies ; and he conferred these, with the reserva tion of stated services and payments, on the most considerable of his adventurers.

The better to unite the parts of the government, and to bind them into one system, which might serve both for defence against foreigners, and for the support of domestic tranquillity, William reduced the ecclesiastical revenues under the fame feudal law ; and though he had courted the church on his invasion and accession, he now subjected it to set viceswhichthe clergy regarded as a grievous slavery; and as totally unbefitting their profession. The bi ssiops and abbots were obliged, when required, to furnissi to the king, during war, a number of knights or military tenants, proportioned to the extent of property possessed by each see or abbey ; and they were liable, in case of failure, to the fame penalties which were exacted from the laity b. The pope and the ecclesiastics exclaimed against this tyranny, as they called it ; but the king's authority was so well establissied over the army, who held every thing from his bounty, that superstition itself, even in that age, when it was most prevalent, was con strained to bend under his superior influence. But as the great body of the clergy were still na tives, the king had much reason to dread the effects of their resentment : He therefore used the precau tion of expelling the Englissi from all the consider- aM.

The partiality of the Confessor towards the Normans had been so great, that aided by their superior learning, it had promoted them to many of the sees in England ; and even before the period of the conquest, scarcely more than six or seven of the prelates were natives of the country. But among these was Stigand, archbissiop of Canterbury, a man who, by his address and vigour, by the greatness of his family and alliances, by the extent of his posses sions, as well as by the dignity of his office, and his authority among the Englissi, gave jealousy to the king c. Though William had on his accession affronted this prelate, by employing the archbissiop of York to officiate at his consecration, he was care ful on other occasions to load him with honours and caresses, and to avoid giving him farther offence till the opportunity ssiould offer of effecting his final de struction'1. The suppression of the late rebellions, and the total subjection of the English, made him hope that an attempt against Stigand, however vio lent, would be covered by his great successes, and be overlooked amidst the other important revolu tions which affected so deeply the property and li berty of the kingdom. Yet, notwithstanding these great advantages, he did not think it fase to violate the reverence usually paid to the primate; but under cover of a new superstition, which he was the great instrument of introducing into England. The doctrine which exalted the papacy above all human power, had gradually diffused itself from the city and court of Rome ; and was, during that age, much more prevalent in the southern than in the northern kingdoms of Europe. Pope Alexander, who had assisted William in his conquests, naturally expected that the French and Normans would im port into England the fame reverence for his sii- c Parker, p. 161. * Ibid. p. 164. cred"], [284, "256 HISTORY OF ENGLAND.' cred character with which they were impressed in their own country ; and would break the spiritual as well as civil independency of the Saxons, who had hitherto conducted their ecclesiastical govern ment with an acknowledgment indeed of primacy in the see of Rome, but without much idea of its title to dominion or authority. As soon, therefore* as the Norman prince seemed fully establissied on the throne, the pope dispatched Ermenfroy, bissiop of Sion, as his legate into England ; and this prelate was the first that had ever appeared with that cha racter in any part of the Britissi islands. The king* though he was probably led by principle to pay this submission to Rome, determined, as is usual, to employ the incident as a means of serving his po litical purposes, and of degrading those English prelates who were become obnoxious to him. The legate submitted to become the instrument of his tyranny ; and thought that the more violent the exertion of power, the more certainly did it confirm the authority of that court from which he derived his commission. He summoned, therefore, a council of the prelates and abbots at Winchester ; and being assisted by two cardinals, Peter and John, he cited before him Stigand, archbissiop of Canterbury, to answer for his conduct. The primate was ac cused of three crimes ; the holding of the see of Winchester, together with that of Canterbury ; the officiating in the pall of Robert his predecessor; and the having received his own pall from Benedict IX. who was afterwards deposed for simony, and for in trusion into the papacy c. These crimes of Stigand were mere pretences ; since the first had been a practice not unusual in England, ,and was never any where subjected to a higher penalty than a re signation of one os the sees; the second was a pure ceremonial ; and as Benedict was the only pope who CHAP IV.

Stigand's ruin, however, was resolved on, and was prosecuted with great severity. The legate degraded him from his dignity: The king confiscated his estate, and cast him into prison, where he continued in poverty and want during the remainder of his life. Like rigour was exercised against the other Englissi prelates : Agelric, biftop of Selesey, and Agelmare of Elmham, were deposed by the legate, and imprisoned by the king. Many considerable abbots soared the fame fate : Egelwin, biftop of Durham, fled the kingdom : Wulstan of Worcester, a man of an inoffensive character, was the only Englissi prelate that escaped this general proscription f, and remained in possession of his dig nity. Aldred, archbissiop of York, who had set the crown on William's head, had died a little be fore of grief and vexation, and had left his male diction to that prince on account of the breach of his coronation oath, and of the extreme tyranny with which he saw he was determined to treat his Englissi subjects g. It was a fixed maxim in this reign, as well as in some of the subsequent, that no native ofthe island ssiould ever be advanced to anydignity, ecclesiastical, civil, or military11. The king, therefore, upon Stigand's deposition, promoted Lanfranc, a Milan ese monk, celebrated for his learning and piety, to the vacant see. This prelate was rigid in defending the prerogatives of his station ; and after a long pro- s' Brompton relates, that Wulstan was also deprived by the sy nod ; but refusing to deliver his pastoral staff and ring to any but the person from whom he first received it, he went immedi ately to king Edward's tomb, and struck the staff so deeply into the stone, that none but himself was able to pull it out : Upon which he was allowed to keep his bishopric. This instance may serve, instead of many, as a specimen of the monkilh miracles. See also the Annals of Burton, p. 284. * Malmef. de Gest. Pont. p. 154. \" Ingulf, p. 70, 71. Vol. I. S cess"], [286, "*58 CHAP IV 1070.

Where ambition can be so happy as to cover its enterprises, even to the person himself, under the appearance of principle, it is the most incurable and. inflexible of all human passions. Hence Lanfranc's zeal in promoting the interests of the papacy, by which he himself augmented his own authority, was indefatigable ; and met with proportionable success. The devoted attachment to Rome continually increased in England ; and being favoured by the sentiments of the conquerors, as well as by the monastic establissiments formerly introduced by Edred and Edgar, it soon reached the fame height at which it had, during some time, stood in France and Italy *. It afterwards went much farther ; being favoured by that very remote situation which had at sirst obstructed his- progress ; and being less checked by knowledge and a liberal education, which were still somewhat more common in the southern countries. The prevalence of this superstitious spirit became dangerous to some of William's successors, and in commodious to most of them : But the arbitrary sway of this king over the Englissi, and his exten sive authority over the foreigners, kept him from feeling any immediate inconveniencies from it. He retained the church in great subjection, as well as his lay subjects ; and would allow none, of what ever character, to dispute his sovereign will and pleasure. He prohibited his subjects from acknow ledging any one for pope whom he himself had not previously received : He required that all the eccle siastical canons, voted in any synod, ssiould first be laid before him, and be ratified by his authority : 1 M.

These regulations were worthy of a sovereign, and kept united the civil and ecclesiastical powers, which the principles intro duced by this prince himself had an immediate tendency to separate. But the Englissi had the cruel mortification to find that their king's authority, however acquired or however extended, was all employed in their op pression ; and that the scheme of their subjection, attended with every circumstance of insult and indig nity ', was deliberately formed by the prince, and Wantonly prosecuted by his followers \u00bb'. William had even entertained the difficult project of totally abolissiing the Englissi language ; and for that pur pose, he ordered that in all schools throughout the kingdom the youth ssiould be . instructed in the French tongue ; a practice which was continued from custom till after the reign of Edward III. and was never indeed totally discontinued in England.

But amidst those endeavours to de- 1070. press the English nation, the king, moved by the remonstrances of some of his prelates, and by the earnest desires of the people, restored a few of the laws of king Edward p ; which, though seemingly of no great importance towards the protection of general liberty, gave them extreme satisfaction, as a memorial of their ancient government, and an un- usual mark of complaisance in their imperious con- querors*. 107'- The situation of the two great earls, Morcar and Edwin, became now very disagreeable. Though they had retained their allegiance during this general insurrection of their countrymen, they had not gained the king's confidence, and they found them selves exposed to the malignity of the courtiers, who envied them on account of their opulence and great ness, and at the fame time involved them in that ge neral contempt which they entertained for the Eng lissi. Sensible that they had entirely lost their dignity, and could not even hope to remain long in safety ; they determined, though too late, to ssiare the lame fate with their countrymen. While Ed win retired to his estate in the north, with a view of commencing an insurrection, Morcar took ssielter in the Isle of Ely with the brave Hereward, who, secured by the inaccessible situation ofthe place, still defended himself against the Normans. But this attempt served only to accelerate the ruin of the few Englissi, who had hitherto been able to preserve their rank or fortune during the past convulsions. Wil liam employed all his endeavours to subdue the Isle of Ely ; and having surrounded it with flat-bot tomed boats, and made a causeway through the morasses to the extent of two miles, he obliged the rebels to surrender at discretion.

Earl Morcar and Egelwin bissiop of Durham, who had joined the malcon- tents, were thrown into prison, and the latter soon after died in confinement. Edwin, attempting to make his escape into Scotland, was betrayed by some of his followers, and was killed by a party of Normans, to the great affliction of the Englissi, and even to that of William, who paid a tribute of ge- nerous tears to the memory of this gallant and beau- tiful youth. The king of Scotland, in hopes of profiting by these convulsions, had fallen upon the northern counties ; but on the approach of William he retired ; and when the king entered his country, he was glad to make peace, and to pay the usual homage to the Englissi crown. To complete the king's prosperity, Edgar Atheling himself, despair- ing of success, and weary of a fugitive life, submit- ted to his enemy; and receiving a decent pension for his subsistence, was permitted to live in England unmolested. But these acts of generosity towards the leaders were disgraced, as usual, by William's rigour against the inferior malcontents. He ordered the hands to be lopt off, and the eyes to be put out, of many of the prisoners whom he had taken in the Isle of Ely; and he dispersed them in that miserable condition throughout the country, as monuments of his severity. The province of Maine in France had, by the will of Herbert the last count, fallen under the do- minion of William some years before his conquest of England ; but the inhabitants, dissatisfied with the Norman government, and instigated by Fulk count of Anjou, who had some pretensions to the succes- sion, now rose in rebellion, and expelled the ma gistrates whom the king had placed over them. The S 3 lull"], [290, "2fJ2 CHAP IV J07 I074. Insurrec tion ot the Norman barons. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. full settlement of England afforded him leisure to punissi this insult on his authority ; but being un, willing to remove his Norman forces from this island, he carried over a considerable army, composed al most entirely of Englissi ; and joining them to some troops levied in Normandy, he entered the revolted province. The Englissi appeared ambitious of dis tinguissiing themselves on this occasion, and of re trieving that character of valour which had long been national among them ; but which their late easy sub jection under the Normans had somewhat degraded and obscured. Perhaps too they hoped that, by their zeal and activity, they might recover the con fidence of their sovereign, as their ancestors had for merly, by like means, gained the affections of Ca nute ; and might conquer his inveterate prejudices, in favour of his own countrymen. The king's miT litary conduct, seconded by these brave troops, soon overcame all opposition in Maine : The inhabitants were obliged to submit, and the count of Anjou rer linquissied his pretensions. But during these transactions the government of England was greatly disturbed ; and that too by those very foreigners who owed every thing to the king's bounty, and who were the sole object of his friendssiip and regard. The Norman barons, who had engaged with their duke in the conquest of England, were men of the most independent spirit ; and though they obeyed their leader in the field, they would have regarded with disdain the richest acquisitions, had they been required in return to submit, in their civil government, to the arbitrary will ps one man. But the imperious character ot William, encouraged by his absolute dominion over the English, and often impelled by the necessity of his affairs, had prompted him to stretch his autho rity over the Normans themselves beyond what the free genius of that victorious people could easily bear. The discontents were become general among those"], [291, "263 CHAP, IV 1074, WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. those haughty nobles ; and even Roger, earl of Hereford, son and heir of Fitz-Osoerne, the king's chief favourite, was strongly infected with them. This nobleman, intending to marry his sister to Ralph de Guader, earl of Norfolk, had thought it his duty to inform the king of his purpose, and to desire the royal consent ; but meeting with a refu sal, he proceeded nevertheless to complete the nup tials, and assembled all his friends, and those of Guader, to attend the solemnity. The two earls, disgusted by the denial of their request, and dread ing William's resentment for their disobedience, here prepared measures for a revolt ; and during the gaiety of the festival, while the company was heated with wine, they opened the design to their guests. They inveighed against the arbitrary con duct of the king ; his tyranny over the Englissi, whom they affected on this occasion to commi serate ; his imperious behaviour to his barons of the noblest birth ; and his apparent intention of re ducing the victors and the vanquissied to a like ig nominious servitude. Amidst their complaints, the indignity of submitting to a bastard q was not for gotten ; the certain prospect of success in'a revolt, by the assistance of the Danes and the discontented Englissi, was insisted on ; and the whole company, inflamed with the same sentiments, and warmed by the jollity of the entertainment, entered, by a so lemn engagement, into the design of ssiaking off the royal authority.

But as he was a man of generous principles, and loved his country, it is probable that the tyranny exer cised over the Englissi lay heavy upon his mind, and destroyed all the satisfaction which he could reap from his own grandeur and advancement. When a prospect, therefore, was opened of retrieving their liberty, he hastily embraced it ; while the fumes of the liquor, and the ardour of the company, pre vented him from reflecting on the consequences of that rassi attempt. But after his cool judgment re turned, he foresaw, that the conspiracy of those discontented barons was not likely to prove success ful against the establissied power of William , or if it did, that the slavery of the Englissi, instead of being alleviated by that event, would become more grievous under a multitude of foreign leaders, fac tious and ambitious, whose union and whose dis cord would be equally oppressive to the people. Tormented with these reflections he opened his mind to his wife Judith, of whose fidelity he en tertained no suspicion, but who, having secretly fixed her affections on another, took this oppor tunity of ruining her easy and credulous husoand. She conveyed intelligence of the conspiracy to the king, and aggravated every circumstance, which, ssie believed would tend to incense him against Waltheof, and render him absolutely implacable'. 1 Order.

Waltheof, convinced by these arguments, went over to Normandy; but though he was well received by the king, and thank ed for his fidelity, the account, previously trans mitted by Judith, had sunk deep into William's mind, and had destroyed all the merits of her hus- band's repentance. The conspirators, hearing of Waltheof's depar- ture, immediately concluded their design to be be- trayed ; and they flew to arms before their schemes were ripe for execution, and before the arrival of the Danes, in whose aid they placed their chief confidence. The earl of Hereford was checked by Walter de L'acy, a great baron in those parts, who, supported by the bissiop of Worcester and the abbot of Evessiam, raised some forces, and pre vented the earl from passing the Severne, or ad vancing into the heart of the kingdom. The earl of Norfolk was defeated at Fagadun, near Cam bridge, by Odo, the regent, assisted by Richard de Bienfaite and William de Warenne, the two ju sticiaries. The prisoners taken in this action had their right foot cut off, as a punissiment of their treason : The earl himielf escaped to Norwich, thence to Denmark; where the Danissi fleet, which had made an unsuccessful attempt upon the coast of England,"], [294, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 266 CHAP IV.

Ralph retired in despair to Britany, where he pos sessed a large estate and extensive jurisdictions. The king, who hastened over to England in order to suppress the insurrection, found that no thing remained but the punissiment of the crimi nals, which he executed with great severity. Many ofthe rebels were hanged; some had' their eyes put out ; others their hands cut off. But William, agreeably to his usual maxims, ssiewed more lenity to their leader, the earl of Hereford, who was only condemned to a forfeiture of his estate, and to im prisonment during pleasure. The king seemed even disposed to remit this last part of the punish ment ; had not Roger, by a fresh insolence, pro voked him to render his confinement perpetual. But Waltheof, being an Englissiman, was not treated with so much humanity; though his^guilt, always much inferior to that ofthe other conspira tors, was atoned for by an early repentance and re turn to his duty. William, instigated by his niece, as well as by his rapacious courtiers, who longed for so rich a forfeiture, ordered hint to be triecj, condemned, and executed. The Englissi, who con sidered this nobleman as the last resource of their na tion, grievously lamented his fate, and fancied that miracles were wrought by his reliques, as a testimony of his innocence and sanctity.

But though the contest seemed very unequal between a private no bleman and the king of England, Ralph was so well supported both by the earl of Britany and the king of France, that William, after besieging him for some time in Dol, was obliged to abandon the en terprise, and make with those powerful princes a peace, in which Ralph himself was included. Eng land, during his absence, remained in tranquillity ; and nothing remarkable occurred, except two eccle siastical synods which were summoned, one at Lon don, another at Winchester. In the former, the pre- cedency among the episcopal sees was settled, and the seat of some of them was removed from small villages to the most considerable town within the di ocese.

All this immense store of spiritual and civil authority was now de volved on Gregory VII. of the name of Hilde brand, the most enterprising pontiff that had ever silled that chair, and the least restrained by fear, de cency, or moderation. Not content with shaking off the yoke of the emperors, who had hitherto exercised the power of appointing the pope on every vacancy, at least of ratifying his election; he undertook the arduous task of entirely disjoining the ecclesiastical from the civil power, and of ex cluding profane laymen from the right which they had"], [296, "268 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. CHAP IV, 1076, had assumed of filling the vacancies of bissiopricsi abbies, and other spiritual dignities w. The sove reigns, who had long exercised this power, and who had acquired it not by encroachments on the church, but on the people, to whom it originally belonged x, made great opposition to this claim of the court of Rome ; and Henry IV. the reigning emperor, defended this prerogative of his crown with a vigour and resolution suitable to its import ance. The few offices, either civil or military, which the feudal institutions left the sovereign the power of bestowing, made the prerogative of con ferring the pastoral ring and staff the most valu able jewel of the royal diadem ; especially as the ge neral ignorance of the age bestowed a consequence on the ecclesiastical offices, even beyond the great extent of power and property which belonged to them. Superstition, the child of ignorance, in vested the clergy with an authority almost sacred ; and as they engrossed the little learning of the age, their interposition became requisite in all civil busi ness, and a real usefulness in common life was thus superadded to the spiritual sanctity of their cha racter. When the usurpations therefore, of the church had come to such maturity as to embolden her to attempt extorting the right of investitures from the temporal power, Europe, especially Italy and Ger many, was thrown into the most violent convulsions, and the pope and the emperor waged implacable war on each other. Gregory dared to fulminate the sen tence of excommunication against Henry and his adherents, to pronounce him rightfully deposed, to free his subjects from their oaths of allegiance ; and instead of shocking mankind by this gross encroach ment on the civil authority, he found the stupid peo ple ready to second his most exorbitant pretensions. w L' Abbe Cone. torn. x. p. 371, 372. com. 2. * Padre Paolo sopra benef. eccles. p. 30.

WiLLiAMvthe Conqueror, the most potent, the most haughty, and the most vigorous prince in Europe, was not, amidst all his splendid successes, secure from the attacks of this enterprising pontiff. Gregory wrote him a letter, requiring him to fulfil his promise in doing homage for the kingdom of England to the see of Rome, and to send him over that tribute, which all his predecessors had been ac customed to pay to the vicar of Christ. By the tribute, he meant Peter's pence ; which, though at first a charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was interpreted, according to the usual practice of the Romissi court, to be a badge of subjection acknow ledged by the kingdom. William replied, that the money ssiould be remitted as usual ; but that neither had he promised to do homage to Rome, nor was it in the least his purpose to impose that servitude on his state c. And the better to ssiow Gregory his in dependence, he ventured, notwithstanding the fre quent complaints of the pope, to refuse to the Eng lissi bissiops the liberty of attending a general coun cil which that pontiff had summoned against his enemies. But though the king displayed this vigour in supporting the royal dignity, he was infected with the general superstition of the asje, and he did not perceive the ambitious scope of those institutions, which, under colour of strictness in religion, were introduced or promoted by the court of Rome. a Epist.

By this artifice, he had endea voured to appease the jealousy of his neighbours, as affording them a prospect of separating England from his dominions on the continent; but when Robert demanded of him the execution of those engagements, he gave him an absolute refusal, and told him, according to the homely saying, that he never intended to throw off his clothes till he went to bed f.

In this disposition on both sides, the greatest trifle sufficed to produce a rup- ture between them.

The whole castle was filled with tumult, which the king himself, who hastened from his apartment, found some difficulty to appease. But he could by no means appease the resentment of his eldest son, who complaining of his partiality, and fancying that no proper atonement had been made him for the insult, left the court that very evening, and hast ened to Rouen, with an intention of seizing the citadel of that place'.

The popular character ofthe prince, and a similarity of manners, engaged all the young nobility of Normandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Britanny, to take part with him ; and it was suspected, that Matilda, his mother, whose favourite he was, supported him in his rebellion by secret remittances of money, and by the encourage ment which ssie gave his partisans. All the hereditary provinces of William, as well as his family, were, during several years, thrown into convulsions bythis war ; and he was at last obliged to have recourse to England, where that species of military government which he had esta blished gave him greater authority than the ancient feudal institutions permitted him to exercise in Nor mandy. He called over an army of Englissi under his ancient captains, who soon expelled Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and restored the authority of the sovereign in all his dominions. The young prince was obliged to take ssielter in the castle of Gerberoy in the Beauvoisis, which the king of France, who secretly fomented all these dissensions, had provided for him. In this fortress he was closely besieged by his father, against whom, having a strong garrison, he made an obstinate de fence.

The resentment harboured by William was so implacable, that he did not im mediately correspond to this dutiful submission of his son with like tenderness; but giving him his ma lediction, departed for his own camp, on Robert's horse, which that prince had assisted him to mount. He soon after raised the siege, and marched with his army to Normandy ; where the interposition of the queen, and other common friends, brought about a reconcilement, which was probably not a little forwarded by the generosity of the son's behaviour in this action, and by the returning sense of his past misconduct. The king seemed so fully appeased, that he even took Robert with him into England ; where he entrusted him with the command of an army, in order to repel an inroad of Malcolm, king of Scotland, and to retaliate by a like inroad into that country.

This monument, called Domefday book, the most valuable piece of antiquity possessed by any nation, is still preserved in the Exchequer; and though only some extracts of it have hitherto been published, it serves to illustrate to us, in many particulars, the ancient state of England. The great Alfred had finissied a like survey of the kingdom in his time, which was long kept at Winchester, and which probably served as a model to William in this undertaking n. The king was naturally a great economist ; and though no prince had ever been more bountiful to his officers and servants, it was merely because he had rendered himself universal proprietor of England, and had a whole kingdom to bestow. He reserved an ample revenue for the crown ; and in the general distribution of land among his fol lowers, he kept possession of no less than 1422 ma nors in different parts of England\", which paid him rent, either in money, or in corn, cattle, and the usual produce of the soil. An ancient historian computes, that his annual fixed income, besides escheats, fines, reliefs, and other casual profits to a great value, amounted to near 400,000 pounds a yearp ; a sum which, if all circumstances be attended to, will appear wholly incredible.

This revenue, therefore, of William, would be equal to at least nine or ten millions at present ; and as that prince had neither fleet nor army to support, the former being only an occasional expence, and the latter be ing maintained, without any charge to him, by his military vassals, we must thence conclude, that no emperor or prince, in any age or nation, can be com pared to the Conqueror for opulence and riches. This leads us to suspect a great mistake in the com putation of the historian : though, if we consider that avarice is always imputed to William, as one of his vices, and that having by the sword rendered him self master of all the lands in the kingdom, he would certainly in the partition retain a great proportion for his own ssiare ; we can scarcely be guilty ot any error in asserting, that perhaps no king of England was ever more opulent, was more able to support, by his revenue, the splendour and magnificence of a court, or could bestow more on his pleasures, or in libe ralities to his servants and favourites 4. There was one pleasure, to which William, as well as all the Normans and ancient Saxons, was extremely addicted, and that was hunting : But this pleasure he indulged more at the expence of his unhappy subjects, whose interests he always dis regarded, than to the loss or diminution of his own revenue. Not content with those large forests, which former kings possessed in all parts of Eng land ; he resolved to make a new forest near Win chester, the usual place of his residence : And for that purpose he laid waste the country in Hampssiire 1 Fortescue, de Dotn. reg. & politic, cap.

The killing of a deer or boar, or even a hare, was punissied with the loss of the delinquent's eyes ; and that at a time, when the killing of a man could be atoned for by paying a moderate fine or composition. The transactions recorded during the remainder of this reign, may be considered more as domestic occurrences, which concern the prince, than as na tional events, which regard England. Odo, bishop of Baieux, the king's uterine brother, whom he had created earl of Kent, and entrusted with a great ssiare of power during his whole reign, had amassed immense riches; and agreeably to the usual pro gress of human wiihes, he began to regard his present acquisitions but as a step to farther gran deur. He had formed the chimerical project of , buying the papacy ; and though Gregory, the reigning pope, was not of advanced years, the pre late had confided so much in the predictions of an astrologer, that he reckoned upon the pontiffs death, and upon attaining, by his own intrigues and money, that envied state of greatness. Re solving, therefore, to remit all his riches to Italy, he had persuaded many considerable barons, and, among the rest, Hugh earl of Chester, to take the same course ; in hopes that when he ssiould mount the papal throne, he would bestow on them more considerable establissiments in that country.

His officers, from respect to the immunities which the ecclesi astics now assumed, scrupled to execute the com mand, till the king himself was obliged in person to seize him ; and when Odo insisted that he was a prelate, and exempt from all temporal jurisdiction, William replied, that he arrested him not as bi ssiop of Baieux, but as earl of Kent. He was sent prisoner to Normandy; and notwithstanding the remonstrances and menaces of Gregory, was detained in custody during the remainder of this reign. CHAP. IV. io8*t Another domestic event gave the king much more concern : It was the death of Matilda, his consort, whom he tenderly loved, and for whom he had ever preserved the most sincere friendship. Three years afterwards he passed into Normandy, and carried with him Edgar Atheling, to whom he willing I y granted permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He was detained on the con tinent by a misunderstanding, which broke out be tween him and the king of France, and which was occasioned by inroads made into Normandy by some French barons on the frontiers. It was little in the power of princes at that time to restrain their licentious nobility ; but William suspected, that these barons durst not have provoked his in dignation, had they not been assured of the coun tenance and protection of Philip. His displeasure was increased by the account he received of some railleries which that monarch had thrown out against him. William, who was become corpulent, had been detained in bed some time by sickness ; upon which Philip expressed his surprise that his brother of England ssiould be so long in being delivered of his big belly.

Immediately on his recovery, he led an army into L'lfle de France, and laid every thing waste with fire and sword. Fie took the town of Mante, which he reduced to assies. But the progress of these hostilities was stopped by an accident, which soon after put an end to William's life. His horse starting aside of a sudden, he bruised his belly on the pommel of the saddle ; and being in a bad ha bit of body, as well as somewhat advanced in years, he began to apprehend the consequences, and or* dered himself to be carried in a litter to the mo nastery of St. Gervas. Finding his illness increase, and being sensible of the approach of death, he dis covered at last the vanity of all human grandeur, and was struck with remorse for those horrible cruelties and acts of violence, which, in the attainment and defence of it, he had committed during the course of his reign over England. He endeavoured to make atonement by presents to churches and monasteries ; and he issued orders, that earl Morcar, Siward, Bearne, and other Englissi prisoners, ssiould be set at liberty.

It is needless to enter into a controversy, which, by the terms of it, must necessarily degenerate into a dis pute of words. It suffices to fay, that the duke of Normandy's first invasion of the island was hos tile; that his subsequent administration was entirely supported by arms ; that in the very frame of his laws he made a distinction between the Normans and Englissi, to the advantage of the former ' ; that he acted in every thing as absolute master over the natives, whose interest and affections he totally dif rep-arded ; and that if there was an interval when he assumed the appearance of a legal sovereign, the period was very ssiort, and was nothing but a tem porary sacrifice, which he, as has been the case with most conquerors, was obliged to make, of his in clination to his present policy. Scarce any of those revolutions, which, both in history and in common language, have always been denominated conquests, appear equally violent, or were attended with so sudden an alteration both of power and property. The Roman state, which spread its do minion over Europe, left the rights of individuals in a great measure untouched ; and those civilized conquerors, while they made their own country the seat of empire, found that they could draw most advantage from the subjected provinces by secur ing to the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of their private possessions.

But the Normans and other foreigners, who followed the standard of William, while they made the vanquissied kingdom the seat of govern ment, were yet so far advanced in arts as to be ac quainted with the advantages of a large property ; and having totally subdued the natives, they pussied the rights of conquest (very extensive in the eyes of avarice and ambition, however narrow in those of reason) to the utmost extremity against them. Ex cept the former conquest of England by the Saxons themselves, who were induced, by peculiar circum stances, to proceed even to the extermination of the natives, it would be difficult to find in all history a revolution more destructive, or attended with a more complete subjection of the ancient inhabitants. Contumely seems even to have been wantonly added to oppression\" ; and the natives were universally re- duced to such a state of meanness and poverty, that the Englissi name became a term of reproach; and several generations elapsed before one family of Saxon pedigree was raised to any considerable honours, or could so much as attain the rank of baron of the realm w. These facts are so apparent from the whole tenour of the Englissi history, that none would have been tempted to deny or elude them, were they not heated by the controversies of faction ; while one party was absurdly afraid of those absurd conse quences which they saw the other party inclined to draw from this event.

Robert's title to the dutchy they esteemed incontestible ; his claim to the kingdom plausible ; and they all desired that this prince, who alone had any pretensions to unite these states, should be put in possession of both. A comparison also of the personal qualities of the two brothers led them to give the preference to the elder. The duke was brave, open, sincere, generous : Even his predominant faults, his extreme indolence and facility, were not disagreeable to those haughty barons, who affected independence, and submitted with reluctance to a vigorous adminisiratic se their sovereign.

The conspirators, retiring to their castles, hastened to put themselves in a mi litary posture ; and expecting to be soon supported by a powerful army from Normandy, they had al ready begun hostilities in many places. The king, sensible of his perilous situation, en deavoured to engage the affections of the native Englissi. As that people were now so thoroughly subdued that they no longer aspired to the recovery of their ancient liberties, and were content with the prospect of some mitigation in the tyranny of the Norman princes, they zealously embraced William's cause, upon receiving general promises of good treatment, and of enjoying the licence of hunting in the royal forests. The king was soon in a situation to take the field ; and as he knew the danger of de lay, he suddenly marched into Kent ; where his uncles had already seized the fortresses of Pevensey and Rochester. These places he successively re duced by famine ; and though he was prevailed on by the earl of Chester, William de Warrenne, and Robert Fitz Hammon, who had embraced his cause, to spare the lives of the rebels, he confiscated all their estates, and banished them the kingdom '.

Some of them received a pardon ; but the greater part were attainted ; and the king bestowed their estates on the Norman barons, who had remained faithful to him. William, freed from the danger of these insur rections, took little care of fulfilling his promises to the Englissi, who still found themselves exposed to the same oppressions which they had undergone during the reign ofthe Conqueror, and which were rather augmented by the violent impetuous temper of the present monarch. The death of Lanfranc, who retained great influence over him, gave soon after a full career to his tyranny ; and all orders of men found reason to complain of an arbitrary and illegal administration. Even the privileges of the church, held sacred in those days, were a feeble rampart against his usurpations. He seized the temporalities of all the vacant bishoprics and abbies; he delayed the appointing of successors to those dig nities, that he might the longer enjoy the profits of their revenue; he bestowed some of the church lands in property on his captains and favourites ; and he openly set to sale such sees and abbies as he thought proper to dispose of. Though the murmurs ofthe ecclesiastics, which were quickly propagated to the nation, rose high against this grievance, the terror of William's authority, confirmed by the suppres sion of the late insurrections, retained every one in subjection, and preserved general tranquillity in England. The king even thought himself enabled to disturb his brother in the possession of Normandy. The loose and negligent administration of that prince had emboldened the Norman barons to affect a great independency ; and their mutual quarrels and devastations hadrendered that whole territory a scene of violence and outrage. Two of them, Walter and"], [319, "WILLIAM RUFUS. 289 CHAP. V 1089. and Odo, were bribed by William to deliver the fortresses of St. Valori and Albemarle into his hands : Others soon after imitated the example of revolt ; while Philip, king of France, who ought to have protected his vassal in the possession of his fief, was, after making some efforts in his favour, engaged by large presents to remain neuter. The duke had also reason to apprehend danger from the intrigues of his brother Elenry. This young prince, who had inherited nothing of his father's great possessions, but some of his money, had furnissied Robert, while he was making his preparations against England, with the sum of three thousand marks ; and, in re turn for so slender a supply, had been put in posses sion of the Cotentin, which comprehended near a third of the dutchy of Normandy. Robert after wards, upon some suspicion, threw him into prison; but finding himself exposed to invasion from the king of England, and dreading the conjunction of the two brothers against him, he now gave Henry his liberty, and even made use of his assistance in soppressingthe insurrections of his rebellious subjects. Conan, a rich burgess of Rouen, had entered into a conspiracy to deliver that city to William ; but Henry on the detection of his guilt, carried the traitor up to a high tower, and with his own hands flung him from the battlements. The king appeared in Normandy at the head of an army ; and affairs seemed to have come to extre mity between the brothers ; when the nobility on both sides,, strongly connected by interest and^ al liances, interposed and mediated an accommodation. The chief advantage of this treaty accrued to Wil liam, who obtained possession of the territory of Eu, the towns of Aumale, Fescamp, and other places : But in return he promised that he would assist his brother in subduing Maine, which had re belled; and that the Norman barons, attainted in Robert's cause, ssiould be restored to their estates in Vol. I.

The two brothers also stipulated, that on the demise of either without issue, the survivor should inherit all his dominions ; and twelve of the most powerful barons on each side swore, that they would employ their power to insure the effectual execution of the whole treaty d : A strong proof of the great independence and authority of the nobles in those ages ! Prince Henry, disgusted that so little care had been taken of his interests in this accommodation, retired to St. Michael's Mount, a strong fortress on the coast of Normandy, and infested the neighbour hood with his incursions. Robert and William, with their joint forces, besieged him in this place, and had nearly reduced him by the scarcity of wa ter ; when the elder hearing of his distress, granted him permission to supply himself, and also sent him some pipes of wine for his own table. Being re proved by William for this ill-timed generosity, he replied, What, shall I suffer my brother to die of thirst ? Where shall we find another when he is gone? The king also, during this siege, performed an act of generosity which was less suitable to his character. Riding out one day alone, to take a survey of the fortress, he was attacked by two soldiers and dis mounted. One of them drew his sword in order to dispatch him ; when the king exclaimed, Hold knave ! I am the king of England. The soldier suspended his blow ; and raising the king from the ground, with expressions of respect, received a hand some reward, and was taken into his service. Prince Flenry was soon after obliged to capitulate ; and be ing despoiled of all his patrimony, wandered about for some time with very few attendants, and often in great poverty. > e Chron.

To this Norman war, which was so soon conluded, there succeeded hostilities with Scotland, which were not of longer duration. Ro bert here commanded his brother'sarmy, and obliged Malcolm, to accept of peace, and do homage to the crown of England. This peace was not more durable. Malcolm, two years after, levying an army, invaded England ; and after ravaging North umberland, he laid siege to Alnwick, where a party of earl Moubray's troops falling upon him by sur prise, a ssiarp action ensued, in which Malcolm was flain. This incident interrupted for some years the regular succession to the Scottift crown. Though Malcolm left legitimate sons, his brother Donald, on account of the youth of these princes, was ad vanced to the throne ; but kept not long possession of it. Duncan, natural son of Malcolm, formed a conspiracy against him ; and being assisted by Wil liam with a small force, made himself master of the kingdom. New broils ensued with Normandy. The frank, open, remiss temper of Robert was ill fitted to withstand the interested rapacious character of William, who, supported by greater power, was still encroaching on his brother's possessions, and in stigating his turbulent barons to rebellion against him. The king, having gone over to Normandy to support his partisans, ordered an army of twenty thousand men to be levied in England, and to be conducted to the sea coast, as if they were instantly to be embarked. Here Ralph Flambard, the king's minister, and the chief instiument of his extortions, exacted ten shillings a-piece from them, in lieu ot tbeir service, and then dismissed them into their se veral counties. This money was so skilfully em ployed by William, that it rendered him better ier- U 2 vice"], [322, "2Q2- CHAP, V. 1094. l\u00b095 1096 ThecrU fedes.

He engaged the French king by new presents to depart from the protection of Robert ; and he daily bribed the Norman barons to desert his service : But was prevented from pussiing his advantages by an incursion ofthe Welssi, which obliged him to return to England. He found no difficulty in repelling the enemy ; but was not able to make any considerable impression on a country guarded by its mountainous situation. A conspiracy of his own barons, which was detected at this time, appeared a more serious concern, and engrossed all his attention. Robert Moubray, earl of Northumberland, was at the head of this combination ; and he engaged in it the count d'Eu, Richard deTunbridge, Roger de Lacey, and many others. The purpose of the conspirators was to dethrone the king, and to advance in his stead Stephen, count of Auinale, nephew to the Con queror. William's dispatch prevented the design from taking effect, and disconcerted the conspira tors. Moubray made some resistance ; but being taken prisoner, was attainted, and thrown into con finement, where he died about thirty years after. The count d'Eu denied his concurrence in the plot ; and to justify himself, fought in the presence of the court at Windsor, a duel with Geoffrey Bainard who accused him. But being worsted in the com bat, he was condemned to be castrated, and to have his eyes put out. William de Alderi, another con spirator, was supposed to be treated with more ri gour when he was sentenced to be hanged. But the noise of these petty wars and commotions was quite funk in the tumult of the crusades, which now engrossed the attention of Europe, and have ever since engaged the curiosity of mankind, as the most signal and most durable monument of human folly that has yet appeared in any age or nation.

Jerusalem by its situation, became one of their most early conquests ; and the Christians had the mortification to see the holy sepulchre, and the other places, consecrated by the presence of their religious sounder, fallen into the possession of infidels. But the Arabians or Saracens were so employed in mili tary enterprises, by which they spread their empire in a few years from the banks of the Ganges to the Streights of Gibraltar, that they had no leisure for theological controversy : And though the Alcoran, the original monument of their faith, seems to con tain some violent precepts, they were much less in fected with the spirit of bigotry and persecution, than the indolent and speculative Greeks, who were con tinually refining on the several articles of their reli gious system. They gave little disturbance to those zealous pilgrims, who daily flocked to Jerusalem ; and they allowed every man, after paying a mode rate tribute, to visit the holy sepulchre, to perform his religious duties, and to return in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometanilm, having wrested Syria from the Saracens, and having in the year 1065, made themselves masters of Jerusalem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult and dangerous to the Christians. The barbarity of their manners, and the confusions attending their unsettled govern ment, exposed the pilgrims to many insults, rob beries, and extortions : and these zealots, returning from their meritorious fatigues and sufferings, filled all Christendom with indignation against the insidek, who profaned the holy city by their presence, and derided the sacred mysteries in the very place ot TJ 3 their"], [324, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 294 CHAP V. 1096, their completion. Gregory VII. among the other vast ideas which he entertained, had formed the design of uniting all the Western Christians against the Mahometans ; but the egregious and violent invasions of that pontiff on the civil power of princes, had created him so many enemies and had rendered his schemes so suspicious, that he was not able to make great progress in this undertaking. The work was reserved for a meaner instrument, whose low condition in life exposed him to no jea lousy, and whose folly was well calculated to coin cide with the prevailing principles of the times. Peter, commonly called the Hermit, a native of Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Being deeply affected with the dangers to which that act of piety now exposed the pilgrims, as well as with the instances of oppression under which the eastern Christians laboured, he enter tained the bold, and in all appearance impractica ble project of leading into Asia, from the farthest extremities ofthe West, armies sufficient to subdue those potent and warlike nations which now held the holy city in subjection e. He proposed his views to Martin II. who filled the papal chair, and who, though sensible of the advantages which the head of the Christian religion must reap from a religious war, and though he esteemed the blind zeal of Peter a proper means for effecting the purpose f, resolved not to interpose his authority, till he saw a greater probability of success.

The more disciplined armies followed after ; and passing the streights at Constantinople, they were mustered in the plains of Asia, and amounted in the whole to the number of 700,000 combatants ,. Amidst this universal frenzy which spread itself by contagion throughout Europe, especially inFrance and Germany, men were not entirely forgetful of their present interests ; and both those who went on this expedition, and those who stayed behind, enter tained schemes of gratifying, by its means, their avarice or their ambition. The nobles who enlisted themselves were moved, from the romantic spirit of the age, to hope for opulent establissiments in the east, the chief seat of arts and commerce during those ages ; and in pursuit of these chimerical pro jects, they sold at the lowest price their ancient castles and inheritances, which had now lost all vahie in their eyes. The greater princes, who remained at home, besides establishing peace in their dominions by giving occupation abroad to the inquietude and mar tial disposition of their subjects, took the opportunity of annexing to their crown many considerable fiefs, either by purchase, or by the extinction of heirs. The pope frequently turned the zeal ofthe crusades from the infidels against his own enemies, whom he re presented as equally criminal with the enemies of Christ. The convents and other religious societies bought the possessions of the adventurers ; and as the contributions ofthe faithful were commonly en. trusted to their management, they often diverted to this purpose v/hat was intended to be employed against the infidels r. But no one was a more imme diate gainer by this epidemic fury than the king of England, who kept aloof from all connexions with thole fanatical and romantic warriors. \"5 Matth.

William employed both me naces and persuasion for that purpose ; but finding the convert obstinate in his new faith, he sent for the father and told him, that as he had not suc ceeded, it was not just that he ssiould keep the pre sent ; but as he had done his utmost, it was but equitable that he ssiould be paid for his pains-, and he would therefore retain only thirty marks of the money x.

There was a mode, which, in that age, prevailed throughout Europe, both among men and women, to give an enormous length to their ssioes, to draw the toe to a ssiarp point, and to affix to it the figuTe of a bird's bill, or some such ornament, which was turned upwards, and which was often sustained by gold or silver chains tied to the knee d. The eccle siastics took exception at this ornament, which they said was an attempt to bely the scripture, where it is affirmed, that no man can add a cubit to his stature ; and they declaimed against it with great vehemence, nay assembled some synods, who abso lutely condemned it. But, such are the strange contradictions in human nature ! though the clergy, at that time, could overturn thrones, and had au thority sufficient to send above a million of men on their errand to the deserts of Asia, they could never prevail against these long-pointed ssioes : On the contrary, that caprice, contrary to all other modes,' maintained its ground during several centuries ; and if the clergy had not at last desisted from their per secution of it, it might still have been the prevailing fassiion in Europe. But Anselm was more fortunate in decrying the particular mode which was the object of his aversion, and which probably had not taken such fast hold of the affections of the people. He preached zealously against the long hair and curled locks which were then fassiionable among the courtiers ; he refused the allies on A ssi- Wednesday to those who were soaccou- A Order.

The noted historian of Anselm, who was also his companion and secretary, celebrates highly this effort of his zeal and piety c. When William's profaneness therefore returned to him with his health, he was soon engaged in con troversies with this austere prelate. There was at that time a schism in the church between Urban and Clement, who both pretended to the papacy f; and Anselm, who, as abbot of Bee, had already acknow ledged the former, was determined, without the king's consent, to introduce his authority into Eng land z. William, who, imitating his father's exam ple, had prohibited his subjects from recognizing any pope whom he had not previously received, was enraged at this attempt ; and summoned a synod at Rockingham, with an intention of deposing An selm : But the prelate's suffragans declared, that, without the papal authority, they knew of no expe dient for inflicting that punishment on their pri mate h. The king was at last engaged by other motives to give the preference to Urban's title ; Anselm received the pall from that pontiff; and matters seemed to be accommodated between the king and the primate ', when the quarrel broke out afresh from a new cause. William had undertaken an expedition against Wales, and required the arch bissiop to furnissi his quota of soldiers for that ser vice ; but Anselm, who regarded the demand as an oppression on the church, and yet durst not re fuse compliance, sent them so miserably accoutred, that the king was extremely displeased, and threat- e Eadmer, p. 23. f Hoveden, p. 463. * Eadmer, p. 29- M.

All his temporalities were seized m ; but he was re ceived with great respect by Urban, who considered him as a martyr in the cause of religion, and even menaced the king, on account of his proceedings against the primate and the church, with the sentence of excommunication. Anselm assisted at the coun cil of Bari, where, besides fixing the controversy between the Greek and Latin churches concerning the procession of the Holy Ghost % the right of election to church preferments was declared to be long to the clergy alone, and spiritual censures were denounced against all ecclesiastics, who did homage to laymen for their sees or benefices, and against all laymen who exacted it \u00b0.

The cession of Normandy and Maine by duke Robert increased the king's territories ; but brought him no great increase of power, because of the un settled state of those countries, the mutinous dispo sition of the barons, and the vicinity of the French king, who supported them in all their insurrections. Even Helie, lord of la Fleche, a small town in Anjou, was able to give him inquietude ; and this great monarch was obliged to make several expedi tions abroad, without being able to prevail over so petty a baron, who had acquired the confidence and affections of the inhabitants of Maine. He was, however, so fortunate as at last to take him pri soner in a rencounter ; but having released him, at the intercession of the French king and the count of Anjou, he found the province of Maine still ex posed to his intrigues and incursions. Elelie, being introduced by the citizens into the town of Mans, besieged the garrison in the citadel : William, who was hunting in the new forest when he received in telligence of this hostile attempt, was so provoked, that he immediately turned his horse, and galloped to the sea-ssiore at Dartmouth ; declaring, that he would not stop a moment till he had taken venge ance for the offence.

The weakness of the greatest monarchs, during this age, in their military expeditions against their nearest neighbours, appears the more surprising, when we consider the prodigious numbers, which even petty princes, seconding the enthusiastic rage of the people, were able to assemble, and to con duct in dangerous enterprises to the remote pro vinces of Asia. William, earl of Poitiers and duke. of Guienne, enflamed with the glory, and not dis couraged by the misfortunes, which had attended the former adventurers in the crusades, had put himself at the head of an immense multitude, com- puted by .some historians to amount to 60,000 horse, and a much greater number of foot s, and he purposed to lead them into the Holy Land against the infidels. He wanted money to forward the pre parations requisite for this expedition, and he offer ed to mortgage all his dominions to William, with out entertaining any scruple on account of that ra pacious and iniquitous hand, to which he resolved to consign them '. The king accepted the offer ; and had prepared a fleet and an army, in order to escort tfie money, and take possession of the rich provinces of Guienne and Poictou ; when an acci dent put an end to his life, and to all his ambitious projects. He was engaged in hunting, the sole amusement, and indeed the chief occupation of princes in those rude times, when society was little cultivated, and the arts afforded few objects worthy of attention. Walter Tyrrel, a French gentleman, remarkable for his address in archery, attended him in this recreation, of which the new forest was the scene ; and as William had dismounted after a chafe, Tyrrel, impatient to ssiow his dexterity, let fly an arrow at a stag, which suddenly started be- S W.

The body of William was found in the forest by the coun try people, and was buried without any pomp or ce remony at Winchester. His courtiers were negli gent in performing the last duties to a master who was so little beloved ; and every one was too much occupied in the interelling object of fixing his suc cessor, to attend the funeral of a dead sovereign. The memory of this monarch is transmitted to andcha us with little advantage by the churchmen, whom wiiham he had offended ; and though we may suspect, in Rufui general, that their account of his vices is somewhat exaggerated, his conduct affords little reason for contradicting the character which they have assigned him, or for attributing to him any very estimable qualities. Lie seems to have been a violent and ty rannical prince ; a perfidious, encroaching, and dangerous neighbour ; an unkind and ungenerous relation. He was equally prodigal and rapacious in the management of his treasury ; and if he possessed abilities, he lay so much under the government of impetuous passions, that he made little use of them in his administration ; and he indulged, without re- serve, that domineering policy, which suited his temper, and which, if supported, as it was in him, with courage and vigour, proves often more suc- cessful in disorderly times, than the deepest foresight and most refined artifice.

The most laudable foreign enterprise which he undertook, was the send ing of Edgar Atheling, three years before his death, into Scotland with a small army, to restore prince Edgar, the true heir of that kingdom, son of Mal colm, and of Margaret, sister of Edgar Atheling ; and the enterprise proved successful. It was remarked in that age, that Richard, an elder brother of Wil liam's, perissied by an accidentMn the new forest; Richard, his nephew, natural son of Duke Robert, lost his life in the fame place, after the fame man ner : And all men, upon the king's fate, exclaimed, that, as the Conqueror had been guilty of extreme violence, impelling all the inhabitants of that large district to make room for his game, the just venge ance of Heaven was signalized, in the same place, by the slaughter of his posterity. William was killed in the thirteenth year of his reign, and about the fortieth of his age. As he was never married, he left no legitimate issue. In the eleventh year of this reign, Magnus, king of Norway, made a descent on the isle of Anglesea, but was repulsed by Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury. This is the last attempt made by the northern nations upon England.

The Greek emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to the western Christ ians for succour against the Turks, entertained hopes, aud those but feeble ones, of obtaining such a moderate supply, as, acting under his command, might enable him to repulse the enemy : But he was extremely astonished to see his dominions over whelmed, on a sudden, by such an inundation of licentious barbarians, who, though they pretended friendssiip, despised his subjects as unwarlike, and detested them as heretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he endeavoured to divert the torrent; but while he employed professions, caresses, civilities, and seeming services towards the leaders of the crusade, he secretly regarded those imperious X t, allies"], [342, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 3io allies as more dangerous than the open enemies by whom his empire had been formerly invaded. Hav ing effected that difficult point of disembarking them safely in Asia, he entered into a private cor respondence with Soliman, emperor of the Turks ; and practised every insidious art, which his genius, his power, or his situation, enabled him to employ, for disappointing the enterprise, and discouraging the Latins from making thenceforward any such pro digious migrations. His dangerous policy was se conded by the disorders inseparable from so vast a multitude, who were not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders of the most inde pendent intractable spirit, unacquainted with mi litary discipline, and determined enemies to civil authority and submission. The scarcity of provi sions, the excesses of fatigue, the influence of un known climates, joined to the want of concert in their operations, and to the sword of a warlike ene my, destroyed the adventurers by thousands, and would have abated the ardour of men impelled to war by less powerful motives. Their zeal, how ever, their bravery, and their irresistible force, still carried them forward, and continually advanced them to the great end of their enterprise. After an obstinate siege they took Nice, the seat of the Turkissi empire ; they defeated Soliman in two great battles ; they made themselves masters of An? tioch ; and entirely broke the force of the Turks, who had so long retained those countries in subjec tion. The soldan of Egypt, whose alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall of the Turkissi power, his former authority in Jerusalem ; and he informed them by his ambassadors, that if they came disarmed to that city, they might now perform their religious vows, and that all Christian pilgrims, who ssiould thenceforth visit the holy se pulchre, might expect the same good treatment which they had ever received from his predecessors. 14.

Among these was Robert duke of Normandy, who, as he had relinquissied the greatest dominions of any prince that attended the crusade, had all along distinguished himself by the most intrepid courage, as well as by that affable disposition and unbounded generosity which gain the hearts of soldiers, and qualify a prince to ssiine in a military life. In passing through Italy, he became acquainted with Sibylla, daughter of the count of Converlana, a young lady of great beauty and merit, whom he espoused: Indulging himself in this new passion, as well as fond of en joying ease and pleasure, after the fatigues of so many rough campaigns, he lingered a twelvemonth in that delicious climate ; and though his friends in the north looked every moment for his arrival, none of them knew when they could with certainty expect it. By this delay he lost the kingdom of England, which the great fame he had acquired during the crusades, as well as his undoubted title, both by birth and by the preceding agreement with his deceased brother, would, had he been present, have infallibly secured to him, Prince Henry was hunting with Rusus in the new forest, when intelligence of that monarch's death was brought him ; and being sensible of the advantage attending the conjuncture, he hurried to Winchester, in order to secure the royal treasure, which he knew to be a necessary implement for fa- cilitating"], [345, "3'3 CHAP.

But Henry, drawing his sword, threatened him with instant death if he dared to disobey him ; and as others ot the late king's retinue, who came every moment to Winchester, joined the prince's party, Breteuil was obliged to withdraw his Opposi tion, and to acquiesce in this violence y .

But as Henry foresaw that a crown, usurped against all rules of justice, would sit unsteady on his head, he resolved, by fair professions at least, to gain the affections of all his subjects. Besides tak ing the usual coronation oath to maintain the laws and execute justice, he passed a charter, which was calculated to relieve many of the grievous oppres sions which had been complained of during the reign of his father and brother \\ He there pro mised, that, at the death of any bissiop or abbot, he never would seize the revenues of the see or abbey during the vacancy, but would leave the whole to be reaped by the successor ; and that he would ne ver let to farm any ecclesiastical benefice, nor dis pose of it for money.

To give greater authenticity to these concessions, Henry lodged a copy of his charter in some abbey of each county ; as if desirous that it ssiould be ex posed to the view of all his subjects, and remain a perpetual rule for the limitation and direction of his government : Yet it is certain that, after the pre sent purpose was served, he never once thought during his reign, of observing one single article of it ; and the whole fell so much into neglect and oblivion, that, in the following century, when the barons, who had heard an obscure tradition of it, desired to make it the model of the great charter which they exacted from king John, they could with difficulty find a copy of it in the kingdom. But as to the grievances here meant to be redressed, they were still continued in their full extent ; and the royal authority, in all those particulars, lay un der no manner ot restriction.

The very form of this charter of Henry proves that the Norman ba rons (for they, rather than the people of England, were chiefly concerned in it) were totally ignorant of the nature of limited monarchy, and were ill quali fied to conduct, in conjunction with their sovereign, the machine of government.

He objected the decrees of the council of Bari, at which he himself had assisted ; and he declared, that so far from doing homage for his spiritual dignity, he would not so much as communicate with any eccle siastic who paid that submission, or who accepted of investitures from laymen. Henry, who expected, in his present delicate situation, to reap great ad vantages from the authority and popularity of An selm, durst not insist on his demand g : He only desired that the controversy might be suspended ; and that messengers might be sent to Rome, in or der to accommodate matters with the pope, and obtain his confirmation of the laws and customs of England. There immediately occurred an important affair, in which the king was obliged to have recourse to the authority of Anselm. Matilda, daughter of Malcolm III. king of Scotland, and niece to Edgar Atheling, had, on- her father's death, and the sub sequent revolutions in the Scottissi government, been brought to England, and educated under her aunt Christina, in the nunnery of Rumsey. This princess Flenry purposed to marry ; but as she had worn the veil, though never taken the vows, doubts might arise concerning the lawfulness of the act ; and it behoved him to be very careful not to shock, in any particular, the religious prejudices of his subjects. The affair was examined by Anselm, in a council of the prelates and nobles which was sum. moned at Lambeth : Matilda there proved that ssie had put on the veil, not with a view of entering into a religious life, but merely in consequence of a cus tom familiar to the Englissi ladies, who protected s W.

The council, sensible that even a princess had otherwise no security for her honour, admitted this reason as valid : They pronounced that Matilda was still free to marry ' ; and her espousals with Henry were celebrated by Anselm with great pomp and solemnity \". No act of the king's reign rendered him equally popular with his Englissi subjects, and tended more to establish him on the throne. Though Matilda, during the life os her uncle and brothers, was not heir of the Saxon line, ssie was become very dear to the Englissi on account of her connexions with it : And that peo ple, who before the conquest had fallen into a kind of indifference towards their ancient royal family. had felt so severely the tyranny of the Normans, that they reflected with extreme regret on their former liberty, and hoped for a more equal and mild administration, when the blood .of their native princes ssiould be mingled with that of their new sovereigns '. But the policy and prudence of Henry, which, if time had been allowed for these virtues to produce their full effect, would have secured him possession of the crown, ran great hazard of being frustrated by the sudden appearance of Robert, who returned to Normandy about a month after the death of his brother William. He took possession, without op position, of that dutchy ; and immediately made preparations for recovering England, of which, during his absence, he had, by Henry's intrigues, been so unjustly defrauded.

He consulted him in all difficult emergencies ; seemed to be governed by him in every measure ; promised a strict regard .to ecclesiastical privileges ; professed a great attachment to Rome, and a resolution of persevering in an implicit obedience to the decrees of councils, and to the will of the sovereign pontiff. By these caresses and declarations he entirely gained the confidence of the primate, whose influence over the people, and authority with the barons, were of the utmost service to him in his present situation. Anselm scrupled not to assure the nobles of the king's sincerity in those professions which he made, of avoiding the tyrannical and oppressive govern ment of. his father and brother : He even rode through the ranks of the army, recommended to the ioldiers the defence of their prince, represented the duty os keeping. their oaths of allegiance, and prognosticated to them the greatest happiness from the government of so. wise and just a sovereign.

The two armies lay in sight of each other for some days without coming to action ; and both princes, being apprehensive of the event, which would probably be decisive, hearkened the more willingly to the councils of Anselm and the other great men, wb# mediated an accommodation be tween them. After employing some negociation, it was agreed that Robert should resign his pre tensions to England, and receive in lieu of them an annual pension of 3000 marks ; that if either of the princes died without issue, the other ssiould succeed to his dominions ; that the adherents of each ssiould be pardoned, and restored to all their pos sessions either in Normandy or England ; and that neither Robert nor Henry ssiould thenceforth en courage, receive, or protect the enemies of the other n.

He began with the earl of Shrewsoury, who was watched for some time by spies, and then indicted on a charge, consisting of forty-five articles.

Iiis ruin involved that of his two bro thers, Arnulf de Montgomery, and Roger earl of Lancaster. Soon after followed the prosecution and condemnation of Robert de Pontefract and Robert de Mallet, who had distinguissied themselves among Robert's adherents. William de Warenne was the next victim : Even Willliam earl of Corn wal,, son of the earl of Mortaigne, the king's uncle, having given matter of suspicion against him, lost all the vast acquisitions of his family in England. Though the usual violence and tyranny of the Nor man barons afforded a plausible pretence for those prosecutions, and it is probable that none of the sentences pronounced against these noblemen was wholly iniquitous ; men easily saw, or conjectured, that the chief part of their guilt was not the injustice or illegality of their conduct. Robert, enraged at the fate of his friends, imprudently ventured to come into England ; and he remonstrated with his brother, in severe terms, against this breach of treaty : But met with so bad a reception, that he began to apprehend danger to his own liberty, and was glad to purchase an escape, by resigning his pension. The indiscretion of Robert soon exposed him to more fatal injuries. This prince, whose bravery and candour procured him respect while at a dis tance, had no sooner attained the possession of power and enjoyment of peace, than all the vigour of his mind relaxed ; and he fell into contempt among those who approached his person, or were subject to his authority. Alternately abandoned to dissolute pleasures and to womanish superstition, he was so remiss, both in the care of his treasure, and the exercise of his government, that his servants 14 pillaged"], [355, "HENRY I. 323 pillaged his money with impunity, stole from him chap. his very clothes, and proceeded thence to practise VL every species of extortion on his defenceless sob- \"TT01. jects. The barons, whom a severe administration alone could have restrained, gave reins to their unbounded rapine upon their vassals, and inveterate animosities against each other; and all Normandy, during the reign of this benign prince, was become a scene of violence and depredation. The Nor- ' mans at last, observing the regular government which Henry, notwithstanding: his usurped title, had been able to establissi in England, applied to him, that he might use his authority for the sup pression of these disorders ; and they thereby afforded him a pretence for interposing in the affairs of Nor mandy. Instead of employing his mediation to render his brother's government respectable, or to redress the grievances ofthe Normans ; he was only attentive to support his own partisans, and to in crease their number by every art of bribery, in trigue, and insinuation. Having found, in a visit which he made to that dutchy, that the nobility were more disposed to pay submission to him than to their legal sovereign, he collected, by arbitrary extortions on England, a great army and treasure, and returned next year to Normandy, in a situation i!o3. to obtain, either by violence or corruption, the do minion of that province. He took Bayeux by storm after an obstinate siege : He made himself master of Caen by the voluntary submission of the inhabitants: But being repulsed at Falaife, and obliged by the winter season to raise the siege, he returned into England ; after giving assurances to his adherents that he would persevere in supporting and protecting them. Next yearheopened the campaign with the siege \"06. of Tenchebray ; and it became evident, from his preparations and progress, that he intended to usurp the entire possession of Normandy. Robert was at Y 2 last"], [356, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 324 CHAP VI. i ic6 last roused from his lethargy ; and being supported by the earl of Mortaigne and Robert de^Bellesne, the king's inveterate enemies, he raised a consider able army, and approached his brother's camp, with a view of finishing, in one decisive battle, the quarrel between them. He was now entered on that scene of action in which alone he was qualified to excel; and he so animated his troops by his ex ample that they threw the Englissi into disorder, and had nearly obtained the victory \u00b0 ; when the flight of Bellesne spread a panic among the Nor mans, and occasioned their total defeat. Henry, besides doing great execution on the enemy, made near ten thousand prisoners, among whom was duke Robert himself, and all the most considerable barons who adhered to his interests11. This vic tory was followed by the final reduction of Nor mandy : Rouen immediately submitted to the con queror : Falaise, after some negociation, opened its gates ; and by this acquisition, besides ren dering himself master of an important fortress, he got into his hands prince William, the only son of Robert : He assembled the states of Normandy ; and having received the homage of the vassals of the dutchy, having settled the government, re voked his brother's donations, and dismantled the castles lately built, he returned into England, and carried along with him the duke as prisoner.

This prince was distinguished by personal bravery : But nothing can be a stronger proof of his mean talents in every other respect, than that, notwith standing he possessed the affections of the English, and enjoyed the only legal title to the throne, he was allowed, during the reigns of so many violent and jealous usurpers, to live unmolested, and go to his grave in peace.

The king's situation, in the beginning of his reign, obliged him to pay great court to Anselm : The advantages which he had reaped from the zealous friendssiip of that prelate, had made him sensible how prone the minds of his people were to superstition, and what an ascendant the ecclesiastics had been able to assume over them. Fie had seen, on the accession of his bro ther Rusus, that though the rights of primogeni ture were then violated, and the inclinations of al- S Chron. Sax. p. 214. Ann.

These recent examples, while they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body, con vinced him, at the fame time, that it was extremely his interest to retain the former prerogative of the crown in filling offices of such vast importance, and to check the ecclesiastics in that independence to which they visibly aspired. The choice which his brother, in a fit of penitence, had made of Anselm, was so far unfortunate to the king's pretensions, that this prelate was celebrated for his piety and zeal, and austerity of manners; and though his monkissi de votion, and narrow principles, prognosticated no great knowledge of the world or depth of policy, he was, on that very account, a more dangerous instru ment in the hands of politicians, and retained a greater ascendant over the bigoted populace. The prudence and temper of the king appear in nothing more conspicuous than in the management of this delicate affair ; where he was always sensible that it had become necessary for him to risque his whole crown, in order to preserve the most invaluable jewel of it p. Anselm had no sooner returned from banissi ment, than his refusal to do. homage to the king raised a dispute, which Henry evaded at that cri tical juncture, by promising to send a messenger, in order to compound the matter with Pascal II. who then filled the papal throne.

But as he desired still to avoid, at least. to delay, the coming to any dangerous extremity with the church, he persuaded Anselm, that he ssiould be able, by farther negocia tion, to obtain some composition with Pascal ; and for that purpose he dispatched three bishops to Rome, while Anselm sent two messengers of his own, to be more fully assured of the pope's inten tions '.

Anselm's two messengers, who were monks, affirmed to him, that it was impossible this story could have any foundation : But their word was not deemed equal to that of three bishops ; and the king, as if he had finally gained his cause, proceeded to fill the sees of Hereford and Salisourv, and to invest the new bi- shops in the usual manner y .

The policy of the court of Rome has commonly been much admired ; and men, judging by success, have bestowed the highest eulogies on that pru dence by which a power, from such slender begin nings, could advance, without force of arms, to establissi an universal and almost absolute monarchy in Europe. But the wisdom of so long a succession of men who filled the papal throne, and who were of such different ages, tempers, and interests, is not intelligible, and could never have place in na ture. The instrument, indeed, with which they wrought, the ignorance and superstition of the peo ple, is so gross an engine, of such universal preva lence, and so little liable to accident or disorder, that it may be successful, even in the most unskilful hands ; and scarce any indiscretion can frustrate its operations. While the court of Rome was openly abandoned to the most flagrant disorders, even while it was torn with schisms and factions, the power of the church daily made a sensible progress in Europe ; and the temerity of Gregory and cau tion of Pascal were equally fortunate in promoting it. The clergy, feeling the necessity which they lay under of being protected against the violence of princes, or rigour of the laws, were well pleased to adhere to a foreign head, who, being removed from the fear of the civil authority, could freely employ the power ofthe whole church, in defending her an cient or usurped properties and privileges, when invaded in any particular country : The monks, desirous of an independence on their diocesans, pro fessed a still more devoted attachment to the triple crown ; and the stupid people possessed no science or reason, which they could oppose to the most ex orbitant pretensions.

During the course of these controversies, a synod was held at Westminster, where the king, intent only on the main dispute, allowed some ca nons of less importance to be enacted, which tend ed to promote the usurpations of the clergy. The celibacy of priests was enjoined, a point which, it was still found very difficult to carry into execution : And even laymen were not allowed to marry within the seventh degree of affinity n. By this contriv ance the pope augmented the profits which he reap ed from granting dispensations, and likewise those from divorces ; for as the art of writing was then rare, and parish registers were not regularly kept, it was not easy to ascertain the degrees of affinity even among people of rank ; and any man who had money sufficient to pay for it, might obtain a di vorce, on pretence that his wife was more nearly related to him than was permitted by the canons. The synod also passed a vote, prohibiting the laity from wearing long hair \u00b0. The aversion of the clergy to this mode was not confined to England. When the king went to Normandy, before he had conquered that province, the bissiop of Seez, in a formal harangue, earnestly exhorted him to redress the marrifold disorders under which the government laboured, and to oblige the people to poll their hair in a decent form. Henry, though he would not resign his prerogatives to the church, willingly parted with his hair : He cut it in the form which they required of him, and obliged all the courtiers to imitate his example \u2022'.

His nephew William was but six years of age, when he com mitted him to the care of Helie de St. Saen ; and it is probable, that his reason for entrusting that im portant charge to a man of so unblemissied a cha racter, was to prevent all malignant suspicions, in case any accident ssiould befal the life of the young prince. He soon repented of his choice ; but when he desired to recover possession of William's per son, Helie withdrew his pupil, and carried him to the court of Fulk count of Anjou, who gave him protection \\ In proportion as the prince grew up to man's estate, he discovered virtues becoming his birth ; and wandering through different courts of Europe, he excited the friendly compassion of many princes, and raised a general indignation against his uncle, who had so unjustly bereaved him of his inheritance. Lewis the Gross, son of Phi lip, was at this time king of France, a brave and generous prince, who having been obliged, during the lifetime of his father, to fly into England, in order to escape the persecutions of his step-mother Bertrude, had been protected by Henry, and had thence conceived a personal friendship for him. But these ties were soon dissolved after the accession of Lewis, who found his interests to be in so many particulars opposite to those of the Englissi monarch, and who became sensible of the danger attending the annexation of Normandy to England. He joined, therefore, the counts of Anjou and Flan ders in giving disquiet to Henry's government; 1 Eadmer, p. 83. Chron. Sax. p. 211 212,213,2.9 220. 228. Hunt. p. 380. Hoveden, p. 4-0. Atm.

The war which ensued among those princes, was attended with no memorable event, and produced only flight fkirmissies on the frontiers, agreeably to the weak condition of the sovereigns in that age, whenever their subjects were not roused by some great and urgent occasion. Henry by contracting his eldest son William to the daughter of Fulk, detached that prince from the alliance, and obliged the others to come to an accommodation with him. This peace was not of long duration. His nephew, William, retired to the court of Baldwin, earl of FJanders, who espoused his cause ; and the king of France, having soon after, for other reasons, joined the party, a new war was kindled in Nor mandy, which produced no event more memora ble than had attended the former. At last the death of Baldwin, who was slain in an action near Eu, gave some respite to Henry, and enabled him to carry on war with more advantage against his enemies. Lewis, finding himself unable to wrest Norman dy from the king by force of arms, had recourse to the dangerous expedient of applying to the spiritual power, and of affording the ecclesiastics, a pretence to interpose in the temporal concerns of princes. He carried young William to a general council, which was assembled at Rheims by pope Calix tus II. presented the Norman prince to them, com plained of the manifest usurpation and injustice of Henry, craved the assistance of the church for re instating the true heir in his dominions, and repre sented the enormity of detaining in captivity so brave a prince as Robert, one of the most eminent champions of the cross, and who, by that very qua lity, was placed under the immediate protection of the holy see.

He had sent over \"the Englissi bissiops to this synod ; but at the same time had warned them that if any farther claims were started by the pope or the ecclesiastics, he was determined to adhere to the laws and customs of England, and maintain the prerogatives transmitted to him by his predecessors. \" Go,\" said he to them, \" salute the pope in my \" name ; hear his apostolical precepts ; but take \" care to bring none of his new inventions into \" my kingdom.\" Finding, however, that it would be easier for him to elude than to oppose the efforts of Calixtus, he gave his ambassadors orders to gain the pope and his favourites by liberal presents and promises. The complaints of the Norman prince were thenceforth heard with great coldness by the council ; and Calixtus confessed, after a conference which he had the fame summer with Henry, and when that prince probably renewed his presents, that, of all men whom he had ever yet been ac quainted with, he was beyond comparison the most eloquent and persuasive. The warlike measures of Lewis proved as inef fectual as his intrigues. He had laid a scheme for surprising Noyon ; but Flenry having received intelligence of the design, marches to the relief of the place, and suddenly attacked the French at Brenneville, as they were advancing towards it. A ssiarp conflict ensued ; where prince William be haved with great bravery, and the king himself was in the most imminent danger. He was wounded in the head by Crispin, a gallant Norman officer, who had followed the fortunes of William'; but being rather animated than terrified by the blow, he immediately beat his antagonist to the ground, and so encouraged his troops by the example, that they put the French to total rout, and had very nearly ' H.

The dignity of the per sons engaged in this ssiirmissi, rendered it the most memorable action of the war : For, in other re spects it was not of great importance. There were nine hundred horsemen, who fought on both sides; yet were there only two persons slain. The restwere defended by that heavy armour worn by the cavalry in those times '. An accommodation soon after en sued between the kings of France and England ; and the interests of young William were entirely neglected in it. But this public prosperity of Henry was much overbalanced by a domestic calamity which befel him. His only son William had now reached his eighteenth year ; and the king, from the facility with which he himself had usurped the crown, dreading that a like revolution might subvert his family, had taken care to have him recognised suc cessor by the states of the kingdom, and had car ried him over to Normandy, that he might receive the homage of the barons of that dutchy. The king, on his return, set fail from Barfleur, and was soon carried by a fair wind out of sight of land. The prince was detained by some accident ; and his sailors, as well as their captain Thomas Fitz-Ste phens, having spent the interval in drinking, were so flustered, that, being in a hurry to follow the king, they heedlessly carried the ship on a rock, where ssie immediately foundered. William was put into the long boat, and had got clear of the ssiip ; when hearing the cries of his natural sister, the countess of Perche, he ordered the seamen to row back in hopes of saving her : But the num bers who .then crowded in soon funk the boat ; and the prince with all his retinue perissied.

Henry entertained hopes for three days, that his son had put into some distant port of England : But when certain intelligence of the calamity was brought him, he fainted away ; and it was remarked, that he never after was seen to smile, nor ever recovered his wonted cheerfulness x. The death of William may be regarded, in one respect, as a misfortune to the English ; because it was the immediate source of those civil wars, which, after the demise of the king, caused such confusion in the kingdom : But it is remarkable, that the young prince had entertained a violent aversion to the natives ; and had been heard to threaten, that when he should be king, he would make them draw the plough, and would turn them into beasts of burthen. These prepossessions he inherited from his father, who, though he was wont, when it might serve his purpose, to value himself on his birth, as a native of England y, showed, in the course of his government, an extreme prejudice against that people.

Prince William left no children ; and the king had not now any legitimate issue ; except one daughter, Matilda, whom in 1110 he had betroth ed, though only eight years of age \", to the emperor Henry V. and whom he had then sent over to be educated in Germany *. But as her absence from the kingdom, and her marriage into a foreign family, might endanger the succession, Henry, who was now a widower, was induced to marry in hopes of having male heirs ; and he made his addresses to Adelais, daughter of Godfrey duke of Lovaine, and niece of pope Calixtus, a young princess of an amiable person b. But Adelais brought him no children ; and the prince, who was most likely to dispute the succession, and even the immediate pos session of the crown, recovered hopes of subverting his rival, who had successively seized all his patri monial dominions. William, the son of duke Ro bert, was still protected in the French court; and as Henry's connexions with the count of Anjou were broken off by the death of his son, Fulk joined the party of the unfortunate prince, gave him his daugh ter in marriage, and aided him in raising disturb ances in Normandy. But Henry found the means of drawing off the count of Anjou, by forming anew with him a nearer connexion than the former, and one more material to the interests of that count's family. The emperor, his son-in-law, dying with out issue, he bestowed his daughter on Geoffrey, the eldest son of Fulk, and endeavoured to insure her succession by having her recognised heir to all his dominions, and obliging the barons 'both of Nor mandy and England to swear fealty to her.

It seemed probable, that his nephew's party might gain force from the increase of the mal contents: An accession of power which that prince acquired a little after, tended to render his preten sions still more dangerous. Charles earl of Flanders being assassinated during the celebration of divine service, king Lewis immediately put theyoung prince in possession of that county, to which he had preten sions in the right of his grandmother Matilda, wife to the Conqueror. But William survived a very little time this piece of good fortune, which seemed to open the way to still farther prosperity. He was killed in a skirmish with the landgrave of Alsace, his competitor for Flanders ; and his death put an end, for the present, to the jealousy and inquietude of Henry. The chief merit of this monarch's government consists in the profound tranquillity which he efta blifhed and maintained throughout all his domi nions during the greater part of his reign. The mu tinous barons were retained in subjection ; and his neighbours, in every attempt which they made upon him, found him so well prepared, that they were discouraged from continuing or renewing their en terprises. In order to repress the incursions of the Welssi, he brought over some Flemings, in the year 1 Hi, and settled them in Pembrokeshire, where J W. Malm. p. 175.

Though his government seems to have been arbitrary in Eng land, it was judicious and prudent ; and was as little oppressive as the necessity of his affairs would per mit. He wanted not attention to the redress of grievances ; and historians mention in particular the levying of purveyance, which he endeavoured to moderate and restrain. The tenants in the king's de mesne lands were at that time obliged to supply gratis the court with provisions, and to furnissi carriages on the fame hard terms, when the king made a progress, as he did frequently, into any ofthe counties. These exactions were so grievous, and levied in so licentious a manner, that the farmers, when rhey heard of the approach of the court, often deserted their houses as if an enemy had invaded the country d ; and ssiel tered their persons and families in the woods, from she insults of the king's retinue. Henry prohibited those enormities, and punissied the persons guilty of them by cutting off their hands, legs, or other mem bers '. But the prerogative was perpetual ; the re medy applied by Henry was temporary ; and the violence itself of this remedy, so far from giving se curity to the people, was only a proof of the ferocity of the government, and threatened a quick return of like abuses. c H A P, VI. 1128.

But in the year 1 1 16, Anselm abbot of St. Sabas, who was coming over with a like legantine commission, was prohibited from entering the kingdom s ; and pope Calixtus, who in his turn was then labouring under many difficulties, by reason of the pretensions of Gregory, an antipope, was obliged to promise, that he never would for the future, except when so licited by the king himself, send any legate into Eng land'1. Notwithstanding this engagement, the pope, as soon as he had suppressed his antagonist, granted the cardinal de Crema a legantine commission over that kingdom; and the king, who, by reason of his nephew's intrigues, and invasions, found himself at that time in a dangerous situation, was obliged to submit to the exercise of this commission'.

It was a usual maxim with every pope, when he found that he could not prevail in any pretension, to grant princes or states a power which they had always exercised, to resume at a proper juncture the claim which seemed to be resigned, and to pretend that the civil magi strate had possessed the authority only from a special indulgence of the Roman Pontiff. After this man ner, the pope, finding that the French nation would not admit his claim of granting investitures, had passed a bull, giving the king that authority; and he now practised a like invention to elude the com plaints of the king of England. He made the arch bissiop of Canterbury his legate, renewed his com mission from time to time, and still pretended that the rights which that prelate had ever exercised as metropolitan, were entirely derived from the indul gence ofthe apostolic see.

IN the progress and settlement of the feudal law, the male succession to fiefs had taken place some time before the female was admitted ; and estates being considered as military benefices, not as property, were transmitted to such only as could serve in the armies, and perform in person the con ditions upon which they were originally granted. But when the continuance of rights, during some generations, in the fame family, had in a great measure obliterated the primitive idea, the females were gradually admitted to the possession of feudal property ; and the fame revolution of principles which procured them the inheritance of private estates, naturally introduced their succession to go vernment and authority. The failure, therefore, of male heirs to the kingdom of England and dutchy of Normandy, seemed to leave the succes sion open, without a rival, to the empress Matilda ; and as Henry had made all his vassals in both states swear fealty to her, he presumed that they would not easily be induced to depart at once from her hereditary right, and from their own reiterated oaths and engagements.

Englissi subjects were as yet capable of adhering to a strict rule of government ; and as every precedent of this kind seems to give authority to new usurpa tions, he had reason to dread, even from his own family, some invasion of his daughter's title, which he had taken such pains to establissi. Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror, had been married to Stephen count of Blois, and had brought him several sons, among whom Ste phen and Henry, the two youngest, had been in vited over to England by the late king, and had received great honours, riches, and preferment, from the zealous friendssiip which that prince bore to every one that had been so fortunate as to ac quire his favour and good opinion. Henry, who had betaken himself to the ecclesiastical profession, was created abbot of Glastenbury and bissiop of Winchester ; and though these dignities were con siderable, Stephen had, from his uncle's liberality, attained establissiments still more solid and durable '. The king had married him to Matilda, who was daughter and heir of Eustace count of Boulogne, and who brought him, besides that feudal sove reignty in France, an immense property in Eng land, which in the distribution of lands had been conferred by the Conqueror on the family of Bou logne. Stephen also by this marriage acquired a new connexion with the royal family of England; as Mary his wife's mother, was sister to David the reigning king of Scotland, and to Matilda, the first wife of Henry, and mother of the empress. The king, still imagining that he strengthened the in terests of his family by the aggrandizement of Ste phen, took pleasure in enriching him by the grant of new possessions ; and he conferred on him the great* estate forfeited by Robert Mallet in England, and that forfeited by the earl of Mortaigne in Nor- * Gul.'

Stephen, in return, professed great at tachment to his uncle ; and appeared so zealous for the succession of Matilda, that, when the barons swore fealty to that princess, he contended with Ro bert earl of Gloucester, the king's natural son, who ssiould first be admitted to give her this testi mony of devoted zeal and fidelity \\ Meanwhile he continued to cultivate, by every art of popu larity, the friendssiip of the Englissi nation ; and many virtues with which he seemed to be endowed, favoured the success of his intentions. By his bra very, activity, and vigour, he acquired the esteem of the barons : By his generosity, and by an affable and familiar address, unusual in that age among men of his high quality, he obtained the affections of the people, particularly ofthe Londoners c. And though he dared not to take any steps towards his farther grandeur, lest he ssiould expose himself to the jealousy of so penetrating a prince as Henry ; he still hoped that, by accumulating riches and power, and by ac quiring popularity, he might in time be able to open his way to the throne. No sooner had Henry breathed his last than Ste phen, insensible to all the ties of gratitude and fide lity, and blind to danger, gave full reins to his cri minal ambition, and trusted that, even without any previous intrigue, the celerity of his enterprise, and the boldness of his attempt, might overcome the weak attachment which the Englissi and Normans in that age bore to the laws and to the rights of their sovereign. He hastened over to England ; and though the citizens of Dover, and those of Canter bury, apprised of his purpose, ssiut their gates against him', he stopped not till he arrived at London,^ where some of the lower rank, instigated by his emissaries, as well as moved by his general popularity, imme diately saluted him king.

His brother, the bissiop of Winchester, was useful to him in these capital articles : Having gained Roger bissiop of Salisoury, who, though he owed a great fortune and advancement to the favour of the late king, preserved no sense of gratitude to that prince's family ; he applied, in conjunction with that prelate, to William archbissiop of Canterbury, and required him in virtue of his office, to give the Toyal unction to Stephen. The primate, who, as all the others, had sworn fealty to Matilda, refused to perform this ceremony ; but his opposition was overcome by an expedient equally dissionourable with the other steps by which this revolution was effected. Hugh Bigod, steward of the household, made oath before the primate, that the late king on his death-bed had ssiown a dissatisfaction with his daughter Matilda, and had expressed his intention of leaving the count of Boulogne heir to all his do minions d. William, either believing, or feigning to believe, Bigod's testimony, anointed Stephen, and put the crown upon his head ; and from this reli gious ceremony that prince, without any ssiadow either of hereditary title or consent of the nobility or people, was allowed to proceed to the exercise of sovereign authority. Very few barons attended his coronation e ; but none opposed his usurpation, however unjust or flagrant. The sentiment of re ligion, which, if corrupted into superstition, has often little efficacy in fortifying the duties of civil society, was not affected by the multiplied oaths taken in favour of Matilda, and only rendered the people obedient to a prince who was countenanced 11 Matt.

The late king had a great trea sure at Winchester,amounting to a hundred thousand pounds : and Stephen, by seizing this money, im mediately turned against Henry's family the precau tion which that prince had employed for their gran deur and security : An event which naturally attends the policy of amassing treasures. By means of this money the usurper insured the compliance, though not the attachment, of the principal clergy and no bility ; but not trusting to this frail security, he in vited over from the continent, particularly from Bri tanny and Flanders, great numbers of those bravoes or disorderly soldiers, with whom every country in Europe, by reason of the general ill police and tur bulent government, extremely abounded h. These mercenary troops guarded his throne by the terrors of the sword; and Stephen, that he might also over awe all malcontents by new and additional terrors of religion, procured a bull from Rome, which ratified his title, and which the pope, seeing this prince in possession of the throne, and pleased with an appeal to his authority in secular controversies, very readily granted him '. f Such stress was formerly laid on the rite of coronation, that the monkish writers never give any prince the tide of king till he is crowned ; th. ugh he had for some time been in possession of the crown, and exercised all the powers of sovereignty. t W.

Matilda, and her husoand Geoffrey, were as unfortunate in Normandy as they had been in Eng land. The Norman nobility, moved by an here ditary animosity against the Angevins, first applied to Theobald count of Blois, Stephen's elder brother, for protection and assistance ; but hearing afterwards that Stephen had got possession of the Englissi crown, and having many of them the fame reasons as for merly for desiring a continuance of their union with that kingdom, they transferred their allegiance to Stephen, and put him in possession of their govern ment. Lewis the younger, the reigning king of France, accepted the homage of Eustace, Stephen's eldest son, for the dutchy ; and the more to corro borate his connexions with that family, he betrothed his sister Constantia to the young prince. The count of Blois resigned all his pretensions, and re ceived in lieu of them an annual pension of two thousand marks ; and Geoffrey himself was obliged to conclude a truce for two years with Stephen, on condition of the king's paying him, during that time, a pension of five thousand1\". Stephen, who hsd taken a journey to Normandy, sinissied all these transactions in person, and soon after returned to England. Robert earl of Gloucester, natural son ofthe late king, was a man of honour and abilities ; and as he was much attached to the interests of his sister Matilda, and zealous for the lineal succession, it was chiefly from his intrigues and resistance that the king had reason to dread a new revolution of government. This nobleman, who was in Nor mandy when he received intelligence of Stephen's accession, found himself much embarrassed con cerning the measures which he ssiould pursue in that difficult emergency. To swear allegiance to the usurper appeared to him dishonourable, and a k M.

Fie offered Stephen to do him ho mage, and to take the oath of fealty ; but with an express condition that the king ssiould maintain all his stipulations, and ssiould never invade any of Robert's rights or dignities : And Stephen, though sensible that this reserve, so unusual in itself, and so unbefitting the duty of a subject, was meant only to afford Robert a pretence for a revolt on the first fa vourable opportunity, was obliged, by the nume rous friends and retainers of that nobleman, to re ceive him on those terms m. The clergy,- who could scarcely at this time be deemed subjects to the crown, imitated that dangerous example: They annexed to their oaths of allegiance this condition, that they were only bound so long as the king de fended the ecclesiastical liberties, and supported the discipline of the church \". The barons, in return for their submission, exacted terms still more de structive of public peace, as well as of royal au thority : Many of them required the right of forti fying their castles, and of putting themselves in a posture of defence ; and the king found himself to tally unable to refuse his consent to this exorbitant demand\". All England was immediately filled with those fortresses, which the noblemen garrisoned either wiih their vassals, or with licentious soldiers, who flocked to them from all quarters. Unbounded rapine was exercised upon the people for the main- tenance of these troops: and private animosities, which had with difficulty been restrained by law, now breaking out without controul, rendered Eng- land a scene of uninterrupted violence and devasta- tion.

The erection of one castle proved the immediate cause of building many others ; and even those who obtained not the king's permission, thought that they were entitled, by the great principle of self-preservation, to put themselves on an equal footing with their neighbours, who com monly were also their enemies and rivals. The ari siocratical power, which is usually so oppressive in the feudal governments, had now risen to its utmost height during the reign of a prince who, though endowed with vigour and abilities, had usurped the throne without the pretence of a title, and who was necessitated to tolerate in others the fame violence to which he himself had been beholden for his sovereignty. But Stephen was not of a disposition to submit long to these usurpations, without making some effort for the recovery of royal authority. Finding that the legal prerogatives of the crown were re sisted and abridged, he was also tempted to make his power the sole measure of his conduct ; and to violate all those concessions which he himself had made on his accession % as well as the ancient pri vileges of his subjects. The mercenary soldiers, who chiefly supported his authority, having ex hausted the royal treasure, subsisted by depreda tions ; and every place was silled with the best grounded complaints against the government.

David, king of Scotland, appeared at the head of an army in defence of his niece's title, and penetrating into Yorkssiire, committed the most barbarous devasta tions on that country. The fury of his massacres and ravages enraged the northern nobility, who might otherwise have been inclined to join him ; and William earl of Albemarle, Robert de Ferrers, William Piercy, Robert de Brus, Roger Moubray, Ilbert Lacey, Walter l'Espec, powerful barons in those parts, assembled an army, with which they encamped at North-Allerton, and awaited the ar rival of the enemy.

This success overawed the malcontents in England, and might have given some stability to Stephen's throne, had he not been so elated with prosperity as to engage in a contro versy with the clergy, who were at that time an overmatch for any monarch. Though the great power ofthe church in an cient times weakened the authority of the crown, and interrupted the course of the laws, it may be doubted whether, in ages of such violence and out rage, it was not rather advantageous that some li mits were set to the power of the sword, both in die hands of the prince and nobles, and that men were taught to pay regard to some principles and CHAP.

The chief misfortune was, that the pre lates on some occasions acted entirely as barons, employed military power against their sovereign or their neighbours, and thereby often encreased those disorders which it was their duty to repress. The bissiop of Salisbury, in imitation of the nobility, had built two strong castles, one at Sherborne, an other at the Devizes, and had laid the foundations of a third at Malmesoury: His nephew Alexander, bissiop of Lincoln, had erected a fortress at New ark: And Stephen, who was now sensible from experience of the mischiefs attending these multi plied citadels, resolved to begin with destroying those of the clergy, who by their function seemed less entitled than the barons to such military securi ties5. Making pretence of a fray which had arisen in court between the retinue of the bissiop of Salis bury and that of the earl of Britanny, he seized both that prelate and the bissiop of Lincoln, threw them into prison, and obliged them by menaces to deliver up those places of strength which they had lately erected'. Henry bissiop of Winchester, the king's bro ther, being armed with a, legantine commission, now conceived himself to be an ecclesiastical sove reign no less powerful than the civil ; and forgetting the ties of blood which connected him with the king, he resolved to vindicate the clerical privi leges, which he pretended were here openly vio lated. He assembled a synod at Westminster, and there complained of the impiety of Stephen's mea sures, who had employed violence against the dig nitaries of the church, and had not awaited the sen tence ot a spiritual court, by which alone, he af firmed, they could lawfully be tried and condemned, if their conduct had anywise merited censure or pu nissiment u.

Soon after Geoffrey Talbot, William Mohun, Ralph Lovel, William Fitz-John, William Fitz-Alan, Paganell, and many other barons, declared for her ; and her party, which w W. Malm. p. 182. M.

Were we to relate all the military events trans mitted to us by conremporary and authentic histo rians, it would be easy to swell our accounts of this reign into a.largse volume : But those incidents, so little memorable in themselves, and so confused both in time and place, could afford neither instruc tion nor entertainment to the reader. It suffices to fay that the war was spread into every quarter ; and that those turbulent barons, who had already ssiaken off, in a great measure, the restraint of go vernment, having now obtained the pretence of a public cause, carried on their devastations with re doubled fury, exercised implacable vengeance on each other, and set no bounds to their oppressions over the people. The castles of the nobility were become receptacles of licensed robbers; who, sally ing forth day and night, committed spoil on the open country, on the villages, and even on the cities ; put the captives to torture, in order to make them reveal their treasures ; sold their persons to slavery ; and set fire to their houses, after they had pillaged them of every thing valuable. The fierce ness of their disposition, leading them to commit wanton destruction, frustrated their rapacity of its ( purpose; and the poverty and persons even ofthe ecclesiastics, generally so much revered, were at last, from necessity, exposed to the fame outrage which had laid waste the rest of the kingdom. The land was left unfilled; the instruments of husoandry were destroyed or abandoned ; and a grievous famine, the natural result of those disorders, affected equally both parties, and reduced the spoilers, as well as the defenceless people, to the most extreme want and indigence *. \u00bb Chron.

After several fruitless negociations and treaties of peace, which never interrupted these destructive ho stilities, there happened at last an event, which seemed to promise some end ofthe public calami ties. Ralph, earl of Chester, and his half-brother William de Roumara, partisans of Matilda, had surprised the castle of Lincoln ; but the citizens, who were better affected to Stephen, having invited him to their aid, that prince laid close siege to the castle, in hopes of soon rendering himself master of the place, either by assault or by famine. The earl of Gloucester hastened with an army to the relief of his friends ; and Stephen, informed of his approach, took the field with a resolution of giving him battle. After a violent ssiock, the two wings of the royalists were put to flight : and Stephen himself, surrounded by the enemy, was at last, alter exerting great ef forts of valour, borne down by numbers, and taken prisoner. He was conducted to Gloucester ; and though at first treated with humanity, was soon after, on some suspicion, thrown into prison, and loaded with irons. Stephen's party was entirely broken by the cap tivity of their leader, and the barons came in daily from all quarters, and did homage to Matilda. The princess, however, amidst all her prosperity, knew that ssie was not secure of success, unless ssie could gain the confidence of the clergy ; and as the conduct of the legate had been of late very ambi guous, and ssiowed his intentions to have rather aimed at humbling his brother, than totally ruining him, ssie employed every endeavour to six him in her interests. She held a conference with him in an open plain near AVinchester ; where ssie pro mised upon oath, that if he would acknowledge her for sovereign, would recognise her title as the sole descendant of the late king, and would again sub mit to the allegiance which he, as well as the rest of the kingdom, had sworn to her, he ssiould in return"], [396, "3*2 CHAP, VII 1141 Matilda crowned, HISTORY OF ENGLAND. return be entire master of the administration, and in particular ssiould, at his pleasure, dispose of all va cant bissioprics and abbies. Earl Robert, her bro ther, Brian Fitz-Count, Milo of Gloucester,and other great men, became guarantees for her observing these engagements * ; and the prelate was at last in duced to promise her allegiance, but that still bur dened with the express condition, that ssie ssiould on her part fulfil her promises. He then conducted her to Winchester, led her in procession to the cathedral, and with great solemnity, in the presence of many bissiops and abbots, denounced curses against all those who cursed her, poured out blessings on those who blessed her, granted absolution to such as were obedient to her, and excommunicated such as were rebellious \\ Theobald archbissiop of Canterbury soon after came also to court, and swore allegiance to the empress c. Matilda, that ssie might farther ensure the at tachment of the clergy, was willing to receive the crown from their hands ; and instead of assembling the states of the kingdom, the measure which the constitution, had it been either fixed or regarded, seemed necessarily to require, ssie was content, that the legate ssiould assemble an ecclesiastical synod, and that her title to the throne ssiould there be ac knowledged. The legate, addressing himself to the assembly, told them, in the absence of the em press, Stephen his brother had been permitted to reign, and previously to his ascending the throne, had seduced them by many fair promises of honour ing and exalting the church, of maintaining the laws, and of reforming all abuses : That it grieved him to observe how much that prince had in every particular been wanting to his engagements ; public peace was interrupted, crimes were daily committed with impunity, bifliops were thrown into prison and a W.

London, notwithstanding its great power, and its attachment to Stephen, was at length obliged to submit to Matilda ; and her authority, by the pru dent conduct of earl Robert, seemed to be esta blissied over the whole kingdom : But affairs re mained not long in this situation. That princess, besides the disadvantages of her sex, which weak ened her influence over a turbulent and martial people, was of a passionate, imperious spirit, and knew not how to temper with affability the harssi ness of a refusal. Stephen's queen, seconded by many of the nobility, petitioned for the liberty of her husoand ; and offered that, on this condition, he ssiould renounce the crown, and retire into a convent. The legate desired that prince Eustace, his nephew, might inherit Boulogne and the other patrimonial estates of his father s: The Londoners applied for the establissiment of king Edward's laws, instead of those of king Henry, which, they said, were grievous and oppressive \\ All these pe titions were rejected in the most haughty and pe remptory manner.

The artillery also of the church, which his brother had brought over to his side, had, after some inter val, joined the other party. Eugenius III. had mounted the papal throne ; the bissiop of Win chester was deprived of the legantine commission, which was conferred on Theobald archbissiop of Canterbury, the enemy and rival of the former le gate. That pontiff also, having summoned a ge neral council at Rheims in Champagne, instead of allowing the church of England, as had been usual, to elect its own deputies, nominated five Englissi bissiops to represent that church, and required their attendance in the council.

The weakness on both sides, rather than any de crease of mutual animosity, having produced a tacit cessation of arms in England, many ofthe nobility, Roger de Moubray, William de Warrenne, and others, finding no opportunity to exert their mili tary ardour at home, insisted themselves in a new crusade, which with surprising success, after former 'Epist.

But an event soon after happened which threatened a revival of hostilities in Eng land. Prince Henry, who had reached his sixteenth year, was desirous of receiving the honour of knighthood; a ceremony which every gentleman in that age passed through before he was admitted to the use of arms, and which was even deemed requi site for the greatest princes. He intended to receive his admission from his great-uncle, David king of Scotland ; and for that purpose he passed through England with a great retinue, and was attended by the most considerable of his partisans. He re mained some time with the king of Scotland ; made incursions into England ; and by his dexterity and vigour in all manly exercises, by his valour in war, and his prudent conduct in every occurrence, he soused the hopes of his party, and gave symptoms of those great qualities which he afterwards displayed when he mounted the throne of England. Soon after his return to Normandy, he was, by Matilda's consent, invested in that dutchy ; and upon the death of his father Geoffrey, which happened in the subsequent year, he took possession both of Anjou and Maine, and concluded a marriage, which brought him a great accession of power, and ren dered him extremely formidable to his rival. Elea nor, the daughter and heir of William duke of Guienne, and earl of Poictou, had been married sixteen years to Lewis VII. king of France, and had attended him in a crusade, which that monarch conducted against the infidels : But having there lost the affections of her husband, and even fallen under some suspicion of gallantry with a handsome Sa racen, Lewis, more delicate than polite, procured a divorce from her, and restored her those rich pro vinces, which by her marriage ssie had annexed to m Hagulst. p. 275, 276. the"], [402, "368 HISTORY OF ENGLAND. chap, the crown of France. Young Henry, neither dis s v\"'_, couraged by the inequality of years, nor by the re- J152. ports of Eleanor's gallantries, made successful court- ship to that princess, and, espousing her six weeks after her divorce, got possession of all her domi- nions as her dowry. The lustre which he received from this acquisition, and the prospect of his rising fortune, had such an effect in England, that when Stephen, desirous to ensure the crown to his son Eustace, required the archbishop of Canterbury to anoint that prince as his successor, the primate re- fused compliance, and made his escape beyond sea, to avoid the violence and resentment of Stephen. 1153. Henry, informed of these dispositions in the people, made an invasion on England : Having gained some advantage over Stephen at Malmefbury, and having taken that place, he proceeded thence to throw succours into Wallingford, which the king' had advanced with a superior army to besiege. A decisive action was every day expected; when the great men of both sides, terrified at the prospect of farther bloodshed and confusion, interposed with their good offices, and set on foot a negociation be- tween the rival princes. The death of Eustace, during the course of the treaty, facilitated its con- Compro- elusion : An accommodation was settled, by which mue he- jt was agreed, that Stephen ssiould possess the crown twccn the \u2022\u2022 kin- and during his lifetime, that justice ssiould be adminis- pnnee tered in his name, even in the provinces which had submitted to Henry, and that this latter prince ssiould, on Stephen's demise, succeed to the king- dom, and William, Stephen's son, to Boulogne and his patrimonial estate. After all the barons had sworn to the observance of this treaty, and done ho- mage to Henry, as to the heir of the crown, that Death of prince evacuated the kingdom ; and the death of the king.

Religion alone, not politics, carried abroad the views of princes ; while it either fixed their thoughts on the Holy Land, whose conquest and defence was deemed a point of common honour and interest, or engaged them in intrigues with the Ro man pontiff, to whom they had yielded the direc tion of ecclesiastical affairs, and who was every day assuming more authority than they were willing to allow him. Before the conquest of England by the duke of Normandy, this island was as much separated from the rest ofthe world in politics as in situation ; and except from the inroads of the Danish pirates, the Englissi, happily confined at home, had neither enemies nor allies on the continent. The foreign dominions of William connected them with the king and great vassals of France ; and while the opposite pretensions ofthe pope and emperor in Italy produced a continual intercourse between Germany and that country, the two great monarchs of France and England formed, in another part of Europe, a separate system, and carried on their wars and ne gotiations, without meeting either with opposition or support from the others. On the decline of the Carlovingian race, the no bles in every province of France, taking advantage of the weakness of the sovereign, and obliged to provide each for his own defence, against the ra vages of the Norman freebooters, had assumed, both in civil and military affairs, an authority al most independent, and had reduced within very narrow limits the prerogative of their princes. The accession of Hugh Capet, by annexing a great fief to the crown, had brought some addition to the royal dignity ; but this fief, though considerable for a subsect, appeared a narrow basis ot power tor a prince who was placed at the head of ib great a community. The royal demesnes consisted only of B b z Paris,"], [408, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 372 CHAP. VIII 1 54, Paris, Orleans, Eslampes, Compiegne, and a few places scattered over the northern provinces : In the rest ofthe kingdom, the prince's authority was ra ther nominal than real : The vassals were accustom ed, nay entitled, to make war without his permission, on each other : They were even entitled, if they con ceived themselves injured, to turn their arms against their sovereign : They exercised all civil jurisdicton, without appeal, over their tenants and inferior vas sals : Th.;ir common jealousy of the crown easily united them against any attempt on their exorbit ant privileges ; and as some of them had attained the power and authority of great princes, even the. smallest baron was fore of immediate and effectual protection. Besides six ecclesiastical peerages, which, with the ether immunities of the church, cramped extremely the general execution of justice ; there were six lay peerages, Burgundy, Normandy, Guienne, Flanders, Toulouse, and Champagne, which formed very extensive and puissant sovereign ties. And though the combination of all those princes and barons could, on urgent occasions, mus ter a mighty power ; yet was it very difficult to set \u2022that great machine in movement ; it was almost im possible to preserve harmony in its parts ; a sense of common interest alone could, for a time, unite them under their sovereign against a common enemy*; but if the king attempted to turn the force of the com munity against any mutinous vassal, the fame fense of common interest made the others oppose them selves to the success ot his pretensions. Lewis the Gross, the last sovereign, marched at one time to his frontiers against the Germans at the head of an army of two hundred thousand men ; but a petty lord of Corbeil, of Puiset, of Couci, was able, at another period, to set that prince at defiance, and to main tain open war against him. The authority ofthe Englissi monarch was much more extensive within his kingdom, and the diforo- i portion"], [409, "HENRY II. 373 portion much greater between him and the most chap. powerful of his vassals. His demesnes and revs- ...,-^_/ nue were large, compared to the greatness of his \"54> state : He was accustomed to levy arbitrary exac tions on his subjects : His courts of judicature ex tended their jurisdiction into every part ofthe king dom : He could cruih by his power, or by a judi cial sentence, well or ill founded, any obnoxious baron : And though the feudal institutions which prevailed in his kingdom, had the fame tendency as in other states, to exalt the aristocracy and depress the monarchy, it required, in England, according to its present constitution, a great combination ot the vassils to oppose their sovereign lord, and there had not hitherto arisen any baron so powerful as of him self to levy war against the prince, and ro afford protection to the inferior barons. While such were the different situations of France and England, and the latter enjoyed so many advantages above the former; the accession of Henry II. a prince of great abilities, possessed of so many rich provinces on the continent, might ap pear an event dangerous, if not fatal to the French monarchy, and sufficient to break entirely the ba lance between the states. He was master, in the right of his .father, of Anjou and Touraine ; in that of his mother, of Normandy and Maine ; in that of his wise, of Guienne, Poictou, Xaintogne, Auvergne, Perigord, Angoumois, the Limousin. He soon after annexed Britanny to his other states, and was already possessed of the superiority over that province, which, on the first cession of Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had been granted by Charles the Simple in vassalage to that formidable ravager. These provinces composed above a third of the whole French monarchy, and were much superior in extent and opulence to those territories which were subjected to the immediate jurisdiction and government o'l the king. The vassal was here more ]3 h i powerful"], [410, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 374 CHAP, V11I ?'i4' powerful than his liege lord : The situation which had enabled Hugh Capet to depose the Carlovin gian princes, seemed to be renewed, and that with much greater advantages on the side of the vassal : And v/hen England was added to so many pro vinces, the French king had reason to apprehend, from this conjuncture, some great disaster to himself and to his family, : But, in reality, it was this cir cumstance, which appeared so formidable, that laved the Capetian race, and by its consequences exalted them to that pitch of grandeur which they at present enjoy. The limited authority of the prince in the feudal constitutions, prevented the king of England from employing with advantage the force of so many states, which were subjected to his government ; and these different members, disjoined in situation, and disagreeing in laws, language, and manners, were never thoroughly cemented into one monarchy. He soon became, both from his distant place of residence, and from the incompatibility of in terests, a kind of foreigner to his French domi nions ; and his subjects on the continent considered their allegiance as more naturally due to their su perior lord, who lived in their neighbourhood, and who was acknowledged to be the supreme head of their nation. He was always at hand to invade them ; their immediate lord was often at too great a distance to protect them j and any disorder in any part of his dispersed dominions gave advantages against him. The other powerful vassals of the French crown were rather pleased to see the expul sion of the Englissi, and were not affected with that jealousy which would have arisen from the oppres sion of a co-vassal who was of the fame rank with themselves. By this means, the king of France found it more easy to conquer those numerous pro vinces from England, than to subdue a duke of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou, Maine, 3 \u00b0'"], [411, "HENRY II. 375 CHAP.

And after reducing such extensive ter ritories, which immediately incorporated with the body of the monarchy, he found greater facility in uniting to the crown the other great fiefs which still remained separate and independent. But as these important consequences could not be foreseen by human wisdom, the king of France remarked with terror the rising grandeur of the house of Anjou, or Plantagenet ; and, in order to retard its progress, he had ever maintained a strict union with Stephen, and had endeavoured to sup port the tottering fortunes of that bold usurper. But after this prince's death it was too late to think of opposing the succession of Henry, or preventing the performance of those stipulations which, with the unanimous consent of the nation, he had made with his predecessor. The Englissi, harassed with civil wars, and disgusted with the \"bloodssied and depredations which, during the course of so many years, had attended them, were little disposed to violate their oaths, by excluding the lawful heir from the succession of their monarchy q. Many of the most considerable fortresses were in the hands of his partisans ; the. whole nation had had occasion to see the noble qualities with which he was endowed', and to -compare them with the mean talents of Wil liam the son of Stephen ; and as they were ac quainted with his great power, and were rather pleased to see the accession of so many foreign do minions to the crown ot England, they never en tertained the least thoughts of resisting them._ Hen ry himself, sensible of the advantages attending his present situation, was in no hurry to arrive in Eng land : and being engaged in the iiege of a castle on the frontiers of Normandy, when he received in telligence of Stephen's death, he made it a point ot honour not to depart from his enterprise, till he \u2022 Gul.

He revoked all the grants made by his predecessor ', even those which neces- sity had extorted from the empress Matilda ; and that princess, who had resigned her rights in favour of Henry, made no opposition to a measure so ne- cessary for supporting the dignity of the crown.

The earl of Albemarle, Hugh Mortimer, and Roger the son of Milo of Glocester, were inclined to make some resistance to this salutary measure ; but the approach of the king with his forces soon obliged them to submit. \"$(>\u2022 Every thing being restored to full tranquillity in England, Henry went abroad in order to op- pose the attempts of his brother Geoffrey, who, during his absence, had made an incursion into S FitzSteph. p. 13.

Conan, duke or earl of Britanny (for these titles are given indifferently by historians to those princes), pretended that Nantz had been lately separated by rebellion from his principality, to which of right it belonged ; and immediately on Geoffrey's death he took possession of the disputed territory. Lest Lewis the French king ssiould interpose in the con troversy, Henry paid him a visit ; and so illured him by caresses and civilities, that an alliance was contracted between them ; and they agreed that young Henry, heir to the Englissi monarchy, ssiould be affianced to Margaret of France : though the former was only sive years of age, and the latter was still in her cradle. Henry, now secure ofmeeting with no interruption on this side, advanced with his army into Britanny ; and Conan, in despair of being able to make resistance, delivered up the county of Nanfz to him. The able conduct ofthe king procured him farther and more important advantages from this in cident. Conan, harassed with the turbulent dispo sition of his subjects, was desirous of procuring to himself the support of so great a monarch ; and he betrothed his daughter and only child, yet an in fant, to Geoffrey the king's third son, who was ot the fame tender years.

By this means the title to the county of Toulouse came to be disputed between the male and female heirs ; and the one or the other, as op portunities favoured them, had obtained possession. Raymond, grandson of Raymond de St. Gilles, was the reigning sovereign ; and on Henry's reviving his wife's claim, this prince had recourse for protection to the king of France, who was so much concerned in policy to prevent the farther aggrandizement of the Englissi monarch. Lewis himself, when mar ried to Eleanor, had asserted the justice of her claim, and had demanded possession of Toulouse z ; but his sentiments changing with his interest, he now deter mined to defend by his power and authority the title of Raymond. Henry found that it would be requi site to support his pretensions a^*inst potent antago nists ; and that nothing but a formidable army could maintain a claim which he had in vain asserted by arguments and manifestos. An army, composed of feudal vassals, was com monly very intractable and undisciplined, both be cause of the independent spirit of the persons who served in it, and because the commands were not given, either by the choice ofthe sovereign, or from the military capacity and experience of the officers. Each baron conducted his own vassals : His rank was greater or less, proportioned to the extent of his property : Even the supreme command under the prince was often attached to birth : And as the mi litary vassals were obliged to serve only forty days at their own charge ; though if the expedition were distant, they were put to great expence; the prince reaped little benefit from their attendance.

He imposed, therefore, a scutage of 180.000 pounds on the knights' fees, a commutation to which, though it was unusual, and the first perhaps to be met with in history *, the military tenants willingly submitted ; and with this money he levied an army which was more under his command, and whose service was more durable and constant. Assisted by Berenger count of Barcelona, and Trincaval count of Nisines, whom he had gained to his party, he invaded the county of Tou louse ; and after taking Verdun, Castlenati, and other places, he besieged the capital of the pro vince, and was likely to prevail in the enterprise ; when Lewis, advancing before the arrival rjf his main body, threw himself into the place with a small reinforcement. Henry was urged by some of his ministers to prosecute the siege, to take Lewis pri soner, and to impose his own terms in the pacifica tion ; but he either thought it so much his interest to maintain the feudal principles, by which his fo reign dominions were secured, or bore so much re spect to his superior lord, that he declared he would not attack a place defended by him in person ; and he immediately raised the siege \\ He marched into Normandy to protect that province against an in cursion which the count of Dreux, instigated by king Lewis his brother, had made upon it.

Disputes between the civil and eccle siastical The usurpations of the clergy which had at first been gradual, were now become so rapid, and had mounted to such a height, that the contest between the regale and pontificale was really arrived at a crisis in England ; and it became necessary to determine whether the king or tht priests, particularly the archbissiop of Canterbury, ssiould be sovereign ot the kingdom '. The aspiring spirit of Henry, which gave inquietude to all his neighbours, was not likely long to pay a tame submission to the en croachments of subjects ; and as nothing opens the eyes of men so readily as their interest, he was in no danger of falling, in this respect, into that abject superstition which retained his people in subjection. From the commencement of his reign, in the go vernment of his foreign dominions, as well as of England, he had ssiown a fixed purpose to repress clerical usurpations, and to maintain those preroga tives which had been transmitted to him by his predecessors.

Fie was afterwards employed with success by Theobald in transacting business at Rome ; and on Henry's accession he was recom mended to that monarch as worthy of farther pre ferment. Henry, who knew that Becket had been instrumental in* supporting that resolution of the archbissiop, which had tended so much to facilitate his own advancement to the throne, was already prepossessed in his favour ; and finding, on farther acquaintance, that his spirit and abilities entitled him to any trust, he soon promoted him to the dignity of chancellor, one of the first civil offices in the kingdom.

He wore sack-cloth next his skin, which, by his affected care to conceal it, was necessarily the more remarked by all the world : he changed it so seldom, that it was filled with dirt and vermin : His usual diet was bread ; his drink water, which he even rendered farther unpa latable by the mixture of unsavoury herbs : He tore his back with the frequent discipline which he in flicted on it : He daily on his knees wassied, in imi tation of Christ, the feet of thirteen beggars, whom he afterwards dismissed with- presents ' :\"He gained the affections of the monks by his frequent charities to the convents and hospitals.

The earl of Clare, besides the lustre which he de- rived from the greatness of his own birth, and the extent of his possessions, was allied to all the princi- pal families in the kingdom ; his sister, who was a celebrated beauty, had farther extended his credit among the nobility, and was even supposed to have gained the king's affections ; and Becket could not better discover, than by attacking so powerful an interest, his resolution of maintaining with vigour the rights real or pretended, of his see5.

The primate making himself, as was usual in spiritual courts, both judge and party, issued in a summary manner the. sentence of ex- communication against Eynsford, who complained to the king that he who held in capite of the crown ssiould, contrary, to the practice establissied by the Conqueror, and maintained ever since by his suc- cessors, be subjected to that terrible sentence, with- out the previous consent ofthe sovereign '.

This precaution had hi therto been much neglected in England, as well as in other catholic countries; and affairs at last seemed to have come to a dangerous crisis : A sovereign of the greatest abilities was now on the throne : A pre late of the most inflexible and intrepid character was possessed of the primacy : The contending powers appeared to be armed with their full force, and it was natural to expect some extraordinary event to result, from their conflict. Among their other inventions to obtain money, the clergy had inculcated the necessity of penance as an atonement for sin ; and having again introduced the practice of paying them large sums as a com mutation, or species of atonement for the remission of those penances, the sins of the people, by these means, had become a revenue to the priests ; and the king computed, that by this invention alone they levied more money upon his subjects than flowed, by all the funds and taxes, into the royal exchequer \\ That he might ease the people of so heavy and arbitrary an imposition, Henry required that a civil officer of his appointment ssiould be present in all ecclesiastical courts, and ssiould for the future give his consent to every composition which was made with sinners for their spiritual offences. The ecclesiastics in that age had renounced all immediate subordination to the magistrate : They openly pretended to an exemption in criminal accu sations from a trial before courts of justice; and were gradually introducing a like exemption in civil causes : Spiritual penalties alone could be inflicted on their offences : and as the clergy had extremely multiplied in England, and many of them were con-t z Fitz-Steph. p. 32, sequently"], [427, "39* CHAP V1II 1163; HENRY II. sequently of very low characters, crimes of the deepest dye, murders, robberies, adulteries, rapes, were daily committed with impunity by the eccle siastics.

A clerk in Worcesterssiire, having debauched a gen tleman's daughter, had at this time proceeded to murder the father ; and the general indignation against this crime moved the king to attempt the remedy,of an abuse which was become so palpable, and to require that the clerk ssiould be delivered up, and receive condign punissiment from the magis trate2. Becket insisted on the privileges of th* church ; confined the criminal in the bissiop's pri son, lest he ssiould be seized by the king's officers ; maintained that no greater punissiment could be in flicted on him than degradation: And when the king demanded, that immediately after he was de graded he ssiould be tried by the civil power, the primate asserted that it was iniquitous to try a man twice upon the fame accusation, and for the same offence \\ Henry laying hold of so plausible a pretence, resolved to pussi the clergy with regard to all their privileges, which they had raised to an enormous height, and to determine at once those controversies which daily multiplied between the civil and the ecclesiastical jurisdictions.

He left the as sembly with visible marks of his displeasure : He re quired the primate instantly to surrender the honours and castles of Eye and Berkham : The bissiops were terrified, and expected still further effects of his re sentment.

But Henry was not content with a declaration in these general terms : He resolved, ere it was too late, to define expressly those customs, with which he required compliance, and to put a stop to clerical usurpations before they were fully consolidated, and could plead antiquity, as they already did a sacred authority, in their favour. The claims ofthe church were open and visible. After a gradual and insen sible progress during many centuries, the malk had at last been taken off, and several ecclesiastical coun cils, by their canons, which were pretended to be irrevocable and infallible, had positively defined those privileges and immunities, which gave such general offence, and appeared so dangerous to the civil magistrate.

There were only six articles, the least important, which, for the fake of peace, he \\vas willing to ratify.

In vain did Becket urge that his court was proceeding with the utmost re gularity and justice in .trying the mareschal's cause ; which, however, ..he said, would appear from the ssieriss's testimony to be entirely unjust and ini quitous : That he himself had discovered no con tempt ofthe king's court; but, on the contrary, by sending four knights to excuse his absence, had virtually acknowledged its authority : That he also, in consequence of the king's summons, personally appeared at present in the great council, ready to justify his cause against the marefchal, and to sub mit his conduct to their enquiry and jurisdiction : That even ssiould it be found that he had been guilty of non-appearance, the laws had affixed a very slight penalty to that offence : And that, as he was an inhabitant of Kent, where his archiepiscopal palace was seated, he was by law entitled to some greater indulgence than usual in the rate of his fine\".

Becket, after premising that he was not obliged to answer to this suit, because it was not contained in his summons ; after remarking that he had expended more than that sum in the repairs of those castles, and of the royal palace at London ; expressed however his resolution, that money should not be any ground of quarrel between him and his sovereign : He agreed to pay the sum ; and imme diately gave sureties for it'. In the subsequent meeting, the king demanded five hundred marks, which, he affirmed, he had lent Becket during the war at Toulouse ' ; and another sum to the same amount, for which that prince had been surety for him to a Jew. Immediately after these two claims, he preferred a third of still greater importance : He required him to give in the accounts of his admi nistration while chancellor, and to pay the balance due from the revenues of all the prelacies, abbies, and baronies, which had, during that time, been subjected to his management11. Becket observed, that, as this demand was totally unexpected, he had * Fitz-Steph. p. 36. ' Ibid. p. 38. p. 47. u Hoveden, p. 494- Diceto, p- 537- 1 Hist.

The king insisted upon sureties ; and Becket desired leave to consult his suffragans in a case of such im portance w. CHAP, VIII. ii$4. IT is apparent, from the known character of Henry, and from the usual vigilance of his go vernment, that, when he promoted Becket to the fee of Canterbury, he was, on good grounds, well pleased with his administration in the former high office with which he had entrusted him ; and that, even if that prelate had dissipated money beyond the income of his place, the king was satisfied that his expences were not blameable, and had in the main been calculated for his service x. Two years had since elapsed ; no demand had, during that time, been made upon him ; it was not till the quarrel arose concerning ecclesiastical privileges, that the claim was started, and the primate was, of a sud den, required to produce accounts of such intricacy and extent before a tribunal which had ssiewn a determined resolution to ruin and oppress him. To find sureties that he ssiould answer so boundless and uncertain a claim, which, in the king's esti mation amounted to 44,000 marks7, was imprac* ticable; and Becket's suffragans were extremely at a loss what counsel to give him in such a critical emergency. By the advice of the bissiop of Win chester he offered two thousand marks as a general satisfaction for all demands : But this offer was re jected by the king*. Some prelates exhorted him to resign his see, on condition of receiving an ac quittal : Others were of opinion, that he ought to submit himself entirely to the king's mercy a : But the primate, thus pushed to the utmost, had too much courage to sink under oppression: He de- w Fitz-Steph. p. 38. x Hoveden, p. 49;.

After a few days spent in deliberation, Becket went to church, and said mass, where he had pre viously ordered, that the introit to the communion service ssiould begin with these words, Princes fat aud spake against me ; the passage appointed for the martyrdom of St. Stephen, whom the primate thereby tacitly pretended to resemble in his suffer ings for the fake of righteousness.

The king, who was in an inner room, was astonissied at this parade, by which the primate seemed to menace him and his court with the sentence of excommunication ; and he sent some of the prelates to remonstrate with him on account of such audacious behaviour. These prelates com plained to Becket, that, by subscribing himself to the constitutions of Clarendon, he had seduced them to imitate his example ; and that now, when it was too late, he pretended to ssiake of all sub ordination to the civil power, and appeared de sirous of involving them in the guilt which must attend any violation of those laws; establissied by their consent, and ratified by their subscriptions'. Becket replied, that he had indeed subscribed the constitutions of Clarendon, legally, with good faith, and without fraud or reserve ; but in these words was virtually implied a salvo for the rights of their order, which, being connected with the cause of God and his church* could never be relinquissied by their oaths and engagements : That if he and b Fitz-Steph. p. 40.

The king, having now obtained a pretext so much more plausible for his violence, would probably have pussied the affair to the utmost extremity against him ; but Becket gave him no leisure to conduct the prosecution. He refused so much as to hear the sen tence, which the barons, sitting apart from the bi ssiops, and joined to some ssieriffs and barons ofthe second rank % had given upon the king's claim : He departed from the palace ; assied Henry's immediate .permission to leave Northampton ; and upon meet ing with a refusal, he withdrew secretly ; wandered about in disguise for some time ; and at last took ssiipping, and arrived safely at Gravelines. The violent and unjust prosecution of Becket had a natural tendency to turn the public favour on his side, and to make men overlook his former in- gratitude towards the king, and his departure from all oaths and engagements, as well as the enormity of those ecclesiastical privileges, of which he affected to be the champion. There were many other rea sons which procured him countenance and protection in foreign countries. Philip earl of Flanders f, and Lewis king of France E, jealous of the rising greatness of Flenry, were well pleased to give him disturbance in his government ; and forgetting that this was the common cause of princes, they affected to pity extremely the condition of the exiled pri mate ; and the latter even honoured him with a visit at Soissons, in which city he had invited him to six his residence h.

The king,- in re venge, sequestered the revenues of Canterbury ; and by a conduct which might be esteemed arbitrary, had there been at that time any regular check on royal authority, he banissied all the primate's relations and domestics, to the number of four hundred, whom he obliged to swear, before their departure, that they would instantly join their patron. But this policy, by which Henry endeavoured to reduce Becket sooner to necessity, lost its effect : The pope, when they arrived beyond sea, absolved them from their oath, and diflributed them among the convents in France and Flanders : A residence was assigned to Becket himself in the convent of Pontigny, where he lived for some years in great magnificence, partly from a pension granted him on the revenues of that abbey, partly from remittances made him by the French monarch. The more to ingratiate himself with the pope., Becket resigned into his hands the see of Canter bury, to which, he affirmed, he had been unca nonically elected by the authority of the royal man date ; and Alexander, in his- turn, besides investing him anew with that dignity, pretended to abrogate, by a bull, the sentence which the great council of England had passed against him. Henry, after attempting in vain to procure a conference with the pope, who departed soon after for Rome, whither the prosperous state of his affairs now invited him, made provisions against the consequences of that breach which impended between his kingdom and the apostolic see. He issued orders to his justicia- vies, inhibiting, under severe penalties, all appeals to the pope or archbissiop ; forbidding any one to' receive any mandates from them, or apply in any case"], [441, "H E N R Y II. 405 case to their authority ; declaring it treasonable to c h a p. bring from either of them an interdict upon the .

The spiritual powers, which, in the primitive church, were, in a great measure, dependant on the civil, had by a gradual progress reached an equality and independence ; and though the limits of the two jurisdictions were difficult to ascertain or define, it was not impossible, but, by moderation on both sides, government might still have been conducted in that imperfect and irregular manner which attends all human institutions. But as the ignorance of the age encouraged the ecclesiastics dailv to extend their privileges, and even to ad vance maxims totally incompatible with civil go vernment k, Henry had thought it high time to put an end to their pretensions, and formally in a pub lic council, to fix those powers which belonged to the magistrate, and which he was for the future de termined to mamtain. In this attempt he was led to re-establish customs, which, though ancient, were beginning to be abolished by a contrary practice, * Hist. Quad. p. 88. 167. Hoveden, p. 496. M.

Prin ciple, therefore, stood on the one side, power on the other ; and if the Englissi had been actuated by con science more than by present interest, the controversy must soon, by the general defection of Henry's sub jects, have been decided against him. Becket, in order to forward this event, filled all places with ex clamations against the violence which he had suffer ed. He compared himself to Christ, who had been condemned by a lay tribunal ', and who was crucified anew in the present oppressions under which his church laboured : He took it for granted, as a point incontestable, that his cause was the cause of God m : He assumed the character of champion for the pa trimony of the Divinity : He pretended to be the spiritual father ofthe king and all the people of Eng land \" : He even told Henry, that kings reign solely by the authority ofthe church\": And though he had thus torn off the veil more openly on the one side, than that prince had on the other, he seemed still, from the general favour borne him by the ecclesi astics, to have all the advantage in the argument. The king, that he might employ the weapons of temporal power remaining in his hands, suspended the payment of Peter's pence ; he made advances towards an alliance with the emperor, Frederick Bar baroffa, who was at that time engaged in violent wars with pope Alexander ; he discovered some intentions of acknowledging Pascal III. the present anti-pope, who was protected by that emperor ; and by these expedients he endeavoured to terrify the enterpri sing though prudent pontiff from proceeding to ex tremities against him. 1 Epist.

But the violence of Becket, still more than the nature ofthe controversy, kept affairs from remain ing long in suspence between the parties. That pre late instigated by revenge, and animated by the pre sent glory attending his situation, pussied matters to a decision, and issued a censure, excommunicating theking'schief ministers by name, and comprehend ing in general all those who favoured or obeyed the constitutions of Clarendon : These constitutions he abrogated and annulled ; he absolved all men from the oaths which they had taken to observe them ; and he suspended the spiritual thunder over Henry himself, only that the prince might avoid the blow by a timely repentance p. The situation of Henry was so unhappy, that he could employ no expedient for saving his minis ters from this terrible censure, but by appealing to the pope himself, and having recourse to a tribunal whose authority he had himself attempted to abridge in this very article of appeals, and which, he knew, was so deeply engaged on the side of his adversary. But even this expedient was not likely to be long effectual. Becket had obtained from the pope a legantine commission over England ; and in virtue of that authority, which admitted of no appeal, he summoned the bissiops of London, Saliftury, and others, to attend him, and ordered under pain of excommunication, the ecclesiastics, sequestered on his account, to be restored in two months to all their benefices. But John of Oxford, the king's agent with the pope, had the address to procure orders for suspending this sentence ; and he gave the pontiff such hopes of a speedy reconcilement between the king and Becket, that two legates, William of Pavia and Otho, were sent to Nor- p Fitz Steph.

But the pretensions of the parties were, as yet, too op posite to admit of an accommodation : The king required, that all the constitutions of Clarendon ssiould be ratified : Becket, that previously to any agreement, he and his adherents ssiould be re stored to their possessions : And as the legates had no power to pronounce a definitive sentence on ei ther side, the negociation soon after came to no thing. The cardinal of Pavia also, being much attached to Henry, took care to protract the nego tiation ; to mitigate the pope, by the accounts which he sent of that prince's conduct ; and to pro cure him every possible indulgence from the see of Rome. About this time the king had also the ad dress to obtain a dispensation for the marriage of his third son Geoffrey, with the heiress of Britan ny ; a concession, which, considering Henry's de merits towards the church, gave great scandal both to Becket, and to his zealous patron the king of France. The intricacies of the feudal law had, in that age, rendered the boundaries of power between the prince and his vassals, and between one prince and another, as uncertain as those between the crown and the mitre ; and all wars took their origin from disputes, which had there been any tribunal pos sessed of power to enforce their decrees, ought to have been decided only before a court of judicature. Henry, in prosecution of some controversies, in which he was involved with the count of Auvergne, a vassal ofthe dutchy of Guienne, had invaded the territories of that nobleman ; who had recourse to the king of France, his superior lord, for protec tion, and thereby kindled a war between the two monarchs. But this war was, as usual, no less fee ble in its operations, than it was frivolous in its cause"], [445, "HENRY II. 409 CHAP, VIII 1167 \u2022cause and object ; and after occasioning some mu tual depredations9, and some insurrections among the barons of Poictou and Guienne, was termi nated by a peace. The terms of this peace were rather disadvantageous to Henry, and prove that that prince had, by reason of his contest with the church, lost the superiority which he had hitherto maintained over the crown of France : An addi tional motive to him for accommodating those dif ferences. The pope and the king began at last to perceive, that, in the present situation of affairs, neither of them could expect a final and decisive victory over the other, and that they had more to fear than to hope from the duration of the controversy. Though the vigour of Henry's government had confirmed his authority in all his dominions, his throne might be ssiaken by a sentence of excommu nication ; and if England itself could, by its situa tion, be more easily guarded against the contagion of superstitious prejudices, his French provinces at least, whose communication was open with the neighbouring states, would be much exposed, on that account, to some great revolution or convul sion r. He could not, therefore, reasonably ima gine that the pope, while he retained such a check upon him, would formally recognise the constitu tions of Clarendon, which both put an end to pa pal pretensions in England, and would give an ex ample to other states of exerting a like independ ency '. Pope Alexander, on the other hand, be ing still engaged in dangerous wars with the em peror Frederic, might justly apprehend, that Henry, rather than relinquissi claims of such importance, would join the party of his enemy; and as the trials hitherto made of the spiritual weapons by Becket 1 Hoveden, p. 5 1 7.

The disposi- tion cf minds on both sides, resulting from these circumstances, produced frequent attempts towards an accommodation ; but as both parties knew that the essential articles of the dispute could not then be terminated, they entertained a perpetual jealousy of each other, and were anxious not to lose the least advantage in the negotiation. The nuncios, Gra- tian and Vivian, having received a commission to endeavour a reconciliation, met with the king in Normandy ; and after all differences seemed to be adjusted, Henry offered to sign the treaty, with a salvo to his royal dignity ; which gave such umbrage to Becket, that the negotiation, in the end, became fruitless, and the excommunications were renewed against the king's ministers. Another negotiation was conducted at Montmirail, in presence of the king of France, and the French prelates ; where Becket also offered to make his submissions, with a salvo to the honour of God, and the liberties of the church ; which, for a like reason, was extremely offensive to the king, and rendered the treaty abor- tive. A third conference, under the fame media- tion, was broken off, by Becket's insisting on a like reserve in his submissions ; and even in a fourth treaty, when all the terms were adjusted, and when the primate expected to be introduced to the king, and to receive the kiss of peace, which it was usual for princes to grant in those times, and which was regarded as a sore pledge of forgiveness, Henry re fused him that honour ; under pretence, that, dur ing his anger, he had made a rassi vow to that pur pole. This formality served, among such jealous spirits, to prevent the conclusion of the treaty ; and though the difficulty was attempted to be overcome by a dispensation which the pope granted to Henry froni"], [447, "HENRY II. 4ix from his vow, that prince could not be prevailed on c h a p. to depart from the resolution which he had taken.

All difficulties were at last adjusted between the \"7\u00b0- parties ; and the king allowed Becket to return, on *\"*\" conditions which may be esteemed both honourable and advantageous to that prelate.

It was easy to fee how much he dreaded that event, when a prince of so high a spirit could submit to terms so dissionourable in order to prevent it. So anxious was Henry to accommodate all differences, and to reconcile him self fully with Becket, that he took, the most ex traordinary steps to flatter his vanity, and even, on one occasion, humiliated himself so far as to hold the stirrup of that haughty prelate while he mounted y. But the king attained not even that temporary tranquillity which he had hoped to reap from these expedients. During the heat of his quarrel with Becket, while he was every day expecting an inter dict to be laid on his kingdom, and a sentence of excommunication to be fulminated against his per son, he had thought it prudent to have his son, prince Flenry, associated with him in the royalty, and to make him be crowned king by the hands of Roger archbissiop of York. By this precaution he both ensured the succession of that prince, which, considering the many past irregularities in that point, could not but be esteemed somewhat pre carious ; and he preserved at least his family on the throne, if the sentence of excommunication ssiould have the effect which he dreaded, and ssiould make his subjects renounce their allegiance to him. Though this design was conducted with expedition and secrecy, Becket, before it was carried into exe cution, had got intelligence of it ; and being de sirous of obstructing all Henry's measures, as well as anxious to prevent this affront to himself, who * Hist.

There prevailed in that age an opinion, which was a-kin to its other superstitions, that the royal unction was essential to the exercise of royal power3 : It was therefore natural both for the king of France, careful of his daughter's establissiment, and for Becket, jealous of his own dignity, to de mand, in the treaty with Henry, some satisfaction in this essential point. Henry, after apologising to Lewis for the omission with regard to Margaret, and excusing it on account of the secrecy and dis patch requisite for conducting that measure, pro mised that the ceremony ssiould be renewed in the persons both of the prince and princess : And he assured Becket, that besides receiving the acknow ledgments of Roger and the other bissiops for the seeming affront put on the see of Canterbury, the primate ssiould, as a farther satisfaction, recover his rights by officiating in this coronation. But the violent spirit of Becket, elated by the power of the church, and by the victory which he had already obtained over his sovereign, was not content with this voluntary compensation, but resolved to make the injury, which he pretended to have suffered, a handle for taking revenge on all his enemies. On his arrival in England he met the archbissiop ot York, and the bissiops of London and Salisbury, who were on their journey to the king m Nor- mandy : He notified to the archbissiop the sentence of suspension, and to the two bissiops that of ex- \u00ab Hist.

Reginald de Wa renne, and Gervase de Cornhill, two of the king's ministers who were employed on their duty in Kent, asked him, on hearing of this bold attempt, whe ther he meant to bring fire and sword into the king dom ? But the primate, heedless of the reproof, proceeded, in the most ostentatious manner, to take possession of his diocese. In Rochester, and all the towns through which he passed, he was received with the ssiouts and acclamations of the populace. As he approached Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of all ranks and ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated with hymns of joy his triumphant entrance. And though he was obliged, by order of the young prince, who resided at Woodstoke, to re turn to his diocese, he found that he was not mis taken when he reckoned upon the highest venera tion of the public towards his person and his dig nity. He proceeded, therefore, with the more courage, to dart his spiritual thunders: He issued the sentence of excommunication against Robert de Broc and Nigel de Saekville,\" with many others, who either had assisted at the coronation of the prince, or been active in the late persecution of the exiled clergy. This violent measure, by which he in effect denounced war against the king himself, is Commonly ascribed to the vindictive disposition and imperious character of Becket ; but as this prelate was also a man of acknowledged abilities, we are not, in his passions alone, to look for the cause of his conduct, when he proceeded to these extremities against his enemies. His sagacity had led him to discover all Henry's intentions ; and he proposed, by this bold and unexpected assault, to prevent the execution of them. CHAP, VIII. 1170.

Conscious also of his own violence in attempting to break or subdue the inflexible primate, he was not displeased to undo that measure which had given his enemies such advantage against him ; and he was contented that the controversy ssiould terminate in that ambiguous manner, which was the utmost that princes in those ages could hope to attain in their disputes with the see of Rome. Though he drop ped, for the present the prosecution of Becket, he still reserved to himself the right of maintaining, that the constitutions of Clarendon, the original ground of the quarrel, were both the ancient cus toms and the present law ofthe realm : And though he knew that the papal clergy asserted them to be impious in themselves, as well as abrogated by the sentence of the sovereign pontiff, he intended, in spite of their clamours, steadily to put those laws in execution b, and to trust to his own abilities, and to the course of events, for success in that perilous enterprise. He hoped that Becket's experience of a six years' exile would, after his pride was fully gratified by his restoration, be sufficient to teach him more reserve in his opposition ; or if any con troversy arose, he expected thenceforth to engage in a more favourable cause, and to maintain with advantage, while the primate was now in his power% the ancient and undoubted customs of the king dom against the usurpations of the clergy.

But no man who enters into the genius of that age can reasonably doubt of this prelate's sincerity. The spirit of superstition was so prevalent, that it infallibly caught every careless reasoner, much more every one whose in terest, and honour, and ambition, were engaged to support it. All the wretched literature ofthe times was insisted on that side : Some faint glimmerings bf common sense might sometimes pierce through 1 Hist. Quad. p. 144- Trivet, p. $$.

Throughout that large col lection of letters which bears the name of St. Tho mas, we find, in all the retainers of that aspiring prelate, no less than in himself, a most entire and absolute conviction of the reason and piety of their own party, and a disdain of their antagonists : Nor is there less cant and grimace in their style, when they address each other, than when they compose manifestos for the perusal of the public. The spirit of revenge, violence, and ambition, which accom panied their conduct, instead of forming a presump. tion of hypocrisy, are the surest pledges of their sin cere attachment to a cause, which so much flattered these domineering passions. Henry, on the first report of Becket's violent measures, had purposed to have him arrested, and had already taken some steps towards the execution ef that design : But the intelligence of his murder threw the prince into great consternation ; and he was ilnmediately sensible of the dangerous conse quences which he had reason to apprehend from so unexpected an event. An archbissiop of reputed sanctity assassinated before the altar, in the exercise of his functions, and on account of his zeal in main taining ecclesiastical privileges, must attain the highest: honours of martyrdom ; while his murderer would be ranked among the most bloody tyrants that ever were exposed to the hatred and detestation of mankind.

In vain would he plead his own innocence, and even his total ignorance of the fact : He was sufficiently guilty, if the church thought proper to esteem him such : And his concurrence in Becket's martyrdom, becoming a religious opinion, would be received with all the implicit credit which belonged to the most establissied articles of faith. These considera tions gave the king the molt unaffected concern; and as it was extremely his interest to clear himself from all suspicion, he took no care to conceal the depth of his affliction \".

The ter rible blow was thus artfully eluded ; the cardinals Albert and Theodin were appointed legates to ex amine the cause, and were ordered to proceed to Normandy for that purpose ; and though Henry's foreign dominions were already laid under an inter dict by the archbissiop of Sens, Becket's great par tisan, and the pope's legate in France, the general expectation, that the monarch would easily excul pate himself from any concurrence in the guilt, kept every one in suspense, and prevented all the bad consequences which might be dreaded from that sentence. The clergy, meanwhile, though their rage was happily diverted from falling on the king, were not idle in magnifying the sanctity of Becket ; in ex tolling the merits of his martyrdom ; and in exalt ing him above all that devoted tribe who in seve ral ages had, by their blood, cemented the fabric ofthe temple. Other saints had only borne testi mony by their sufferings to the general doctrines of christianitv ; but Becket had sacrificed his life to the power and privileges ofthe clergy; and this peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a suitable acknowledgment to his memory. Endless were the panegyrics on his virtues ; and the miracles wrought by his reliques were more numerous, more nonsensical, and more impudently attested, than those which ever silled the legend of any confessor or martyr. Two years after his death he was canonized by pope Alexander ; a solemn jubilee was establissied for celebrating his merits ; his body was removed to a magnificent ssirine, enriched with presents from all parts of Christendom ; pilgrimages were performed to obtain his intercession with heaven j and it was E e 3 computed,"], [458, "HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 422 CHAP VIII U71 computed, that in one year above a hundred thou- sand pilgrims arrived in Canterbury, and paid their; devotions at his tomb. It is indeed a mortifying reflection to those who are actuated by the love of fame, so justly denominated the last infirmity of noble minds, that the wjsest legislator, and most exalted genius that ever reformed or enlightened the world, can never expect such tributes of praise as are lavissied on the memory of pretended saints, whose whole conduct was probably to the last de- gree odious or contemptible, and whose industry was entirely directed to the pursuit of objects per- nicious to mankind. It is only a conqueror, 3 per- sonage no less entitled to our hatred, who can pre- tend to the attainment of equal renown and glory. It may not be amiss to remark, before we con- clude the subject of Thomas a Becket, that the king, during his controversy with that prelate, was on every occasion more anxious than usual to express his zeal for religion, and to avoid all appearance of a profane negligence on that head. He gave his consent to the imposing of a tax on all his domi- nions for the delivery of the Holy Land, no\\y threatened by the famous Saladine : This tax amounted to two pence a pound for one year, and a penny a pound for the four subsequent \u00b0. Almost aU the princes of Europe laid a like imposition on their subjects, which received the name of Saladine's tax. During this period, there came over from Germany about thirty heretics of both sexes, undtr the direction of one Gerard ; simple ignorant people, who could (rive no account of their faith, but de- clared themselves ready to suffer for the tenets of their master. They made only one convert in England, a woman as ignorant as themselves ; yet they gave such umbrage to the clergy, that they were delivered over to the secular arm, and were * Chron.

It is pro bable that their departure from the standard of or thodoxy was still more subtle and minute. They seem to have been the first that ever suffered for he resy in England. As soon as Henry found that he was in no imme diate danger from the thunders ofthe Vatican, he undertook an expedition against Ireland ; a design which he had long projected, and by which he hoped to recover his credit, somewhat impaired by his late transactions with the hierarchy. > Neubr. 391.

The Irish from the be ginning of time had been buried in the most pro found barbarism and ignorance ; and as they were never conquered, or even invaded by the Romans, from whom all the western world derived its civi lity, they continued still in the most rude state of society, and were distinguissied by those vices alone to which human nature, not tamed by education, or restrained by laws, is for ever subject. The small principalities into which they were divided, exercised perpetual rapine and violence against each other ; the uncertain succession of their princes was a continual source of domestic convulsions ; the usual"], [461, "HENRY IT. 425 CHAP, IX. 1171. usual title of each petty sovereign was the murderer of his predecessor ; courage and force, though ex ercised in the commission of crimes, were more ho noured than any pacific virtues ; and the most sim ple arts of life even tillage and agriculture, were almost wholly unknown among them. They had felt the invasions of the Danes and the other northern tribes ; but these inroads, which had spread barba rism in other parts of Europe, tended rather to im prove the Irish; and the only towns which were to be found in the island, had been planted along the coast by the freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other inhabitants exercised pasturage in the open country ; sought protection from any danger in their forests and morasses ; and being divided by the fiercest animosities against each other, were still more intent on the means of mutual injury, thanon the expedients for common or even for private in terest. Besides many small tribes, there were in the age of Henry II. five principal sovereignties in the island, Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster, and Connaught ; and as it had been usual for the one or the other of these to take the lead in their wars, there was commonly some prince, who seemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ireland. Roderic O'Connor, king of Connaught, was then advanced to this dignity H ; but his government, ill obeyed even within his own territory, could not unite the people in any measures either for the establissiment of order, or for defence against foreigners. The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign, been moved by the prospect os thele advantages, to attempt the subjecting of Ireland ; and a pretence was only wanting to invade a people who, being always confined to their own island, had never given any reason of complaint to any of their neigh- 1 Hpveden, p. 527. bours."], [462, "4*6 CHAP, IX. 1172, HISTORY OF ENGLAND. bours. For this purpose, he had recourse to Rome, which assumed a right to dispose of kingdoms and empires ; and not foreseeing the dangerous disputes, which he was one day to maintain with that see, he helped, for present, or rather for an imaginary con venience, to give sanction to claims which were now become dangerous to all sovereigns. Adrian III. who then filled the papal chair, was by birth an Englissiman ; and being on that account the more disposed to oblige Henry, he was easily persuaded to act as master of the world, and to make, with out any hazard or expence, the acquisition of a great island to his spiritual jurisdiction. The Irish had, by precedent missions from the Britons, been imperfectly converted to Christianity ; and, what the pope regarded as the surest mark of their im perfect conversion, they followed the doctrines of their first teachers, and had never acknowledged any subjection to the see of Rome. Adrian, there fore, in the year 11 56, issued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after premising that this prince had ever (hewn an anxious care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to increase the num ber of his saints and elect in heaven ; he represents his design of subduing Ireland as derived from the fame pious motives : He considers his care of pre viously applying for the apostolic sanction as a sore earnest of success and victory ; and having esta blissied it as a point inconfestible, that all christian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it to be his own duty to sow among them the feeds of the gospel, which might in the last day fructify to their eternal salvation : He ex horts the king to invade Ireland, in order to extir pate the vice and wickedness of the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every house, a penny to the see of Rome : He gives him entire right and authority over the island, commands all the inhabitants to obey him as their sovereign, and in- vests"], [463, "HENRY II. 427 CHAP IX. 1 172, yests with full power all such godly instruments as he ssiould think proper to employ in an enterprise thus calculated for the glory of God and the salva tion of the souls of men \\ Henry, though armed with this authority, did not immediately put his design in execution ; but being detained by more interesting business on the continent, waited for a favourable opportunity of invading Ireland. Dermot Macmorrogh, king of Leinster, had, by his licentious tyranny, rendered himself odious to his subjects, who seized with alacrity the first oc casion that offered of throwing off the yoke, which was become grievous and oppressive to them. This prince had formed a design on Dovergilda, wife of Ororic prince of Bressny ; and taking advantage of her husoand's absence, who, being obliged to visit a distant part of his territory, had left his wife se- cure, as he thought, in an island surrounded by a bog ; he suddenly invaded the place and carried off the princess s. This exploit, though usual among the Irish, and rather deemed a proof of gallantry and spirit ', provoked the resentment of the hus- band ; who, having collected forces, and being strengthened by the alliance of Fioderic king of Connaught, invaded the dominions of Dermot, and expelled him his kingdom. The exiled prince had recourse to Henry, who was at this time in Guienne, craved his assistance in restoring him to his sove- reignty, and offered, on that event, to hold his kingdom in vassalage under the crown of England. Henry, whose views were already turned towards making acquisitions in Ireland, readily accepted the offer; but being at that time embarrassed by the re- bellions of his French subjects, as well as by his disputes with the see of Rome, he declined for the present embarking in the enterprise, and gave T M.

Dermot, supported by this authority, came to Bristol ; and after endeavouring, though for some time in vain, to engage adventurers in the enterprise, he at last formed a treaty with Richard, surnamed Strongbow, earl of Strigul. This nobleman, who was of the illustrious house of Clare, had impaired his fortune by expensive pleasures ; and being ready for any desperate undertaking, he promised assistance to Dermot, on condition that he ssiould espouse Eva daughter of that prince, and be declared heir to all his dominions\". While Richard was assembling his succours, Dermot went into Wales ; and meet- ing with Robert Fitz-Stephens, constable of Aber- tiyi, and Maurice Fitz- Gerald, he also engaged them in his service, and obtained their promise of invading Ireland.

Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived with ten knights, thirty esquires, and a hundred archers2; and being joined by the former adven turers,, composed a force which nothing in Ireland was able to withstand. Roderic, the chief monarch of the island, was foiled in different actions ; the prince of Offory was obliged to submit, and give hostages for his peaceable behaviour ; and Dermot, not content with being restored to his kingdom of Leinster, projected the dethroning of Roderic, and aspired to the sole dominion over the Irish. In prosecution of these views, he sent over a messenger to the earl of Strigul, challenging the performance of his promise, and displaying the mighty advantages which might now be reaped by a reinforcement of warlike troops from England. Richard, not satisfied with the general allowance given by Henry to all his subjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and having obtained a cold or ambiguous permission, prepared himself for the execution of his designs. He first sent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and seventy archers, who, landing near Watertord, de feated a body of three thousand Iriih that had ven tured to attack him a ; and as Richard himself, who brought over two hundred horse, and a body of archers, joined, a few days after, the victorious Englissi, they made themselves masters of Water - ford, and proceeded to Dublin, which was taken by assault.

Henry, jealous ofthe progress made by his own subjects, sent orders to recal all the Englissi, and he made preparations to attack Ireland in person c : But Richard, and the other adventurers, found means to appease him, by making him the most humble submissions, and offering to hold all their acquisitions in vassalage to his crown d. That mo narch landed in Ireland at the head of five hundred knights, besides other soldiers : He found the Irish so dispirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a pro gress which he made through the island, he had no other occupation than to receive the homage of his new subjects. He left most of the Irish chieftains or princes in possession of their ancient territories ; bestowed some lands on the Englissi adventurers ; gave earl Richard the commission of seneschal of Ireland; and after a stay of a few months, returned in triumph to England. By these trivial exploits, scarcely worth relating, except for the importance of the consequences, was Ireland subdued, and an nexed to the Englissi crown. The low state of commerce and industry during those ages made it impracticable for princes to sup port regular armies, which might retain a conquered country in subjection ; and the extreme barbarism and poverty of Ireland could still less afford means of bearing the expence.

By this policy, the l\u2014^hj northern invaders of old, and of late the duke of 1172.

But the state of Ire land rendered that island so little inviting to the Englissi, that only a few of desperate fortunes could be persuaded, from time to time, to transport themselves thither' ; and instead of reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated manners, they were gradually assimilated to the ancient inhabitants, and degenerated from the customs. of their own nation. It was also found requisite to bestow great military and arbitrary powers on the leaders, who command ed a handful of men amidst such hostile multitudes ; and law and equity, in a little time, became as much unknown in the Englissi settlements, as they had ever been among the Irish tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of the new adventurers ; in dependent authority conferred ; the natives, never fully subdued, still retained their animosity against the conquerors ; their hatred was retaliated by like injuries ; and from these causes, the Irissi, during the course of four centuries, remained still savage and untractable : It was not till the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, that the island was fully subdued; nor till that of her successor, that it gave hopes of becoming a useful conquest to the Englissi nation. Besides that the easy and peaceable submission of the Irissi left Henry no farther occupation in that island, he was recalled from if by another incident, which was ofthe last importance to his interest and safety.

He hastened therefore to Normandy, and had a conference with them at Savigny, where their de mands were so exorbitant,' that he broke off the ne gotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade them do their worst against him. They perceived that the season was now past for taking advantage of that tragical incident ; which, had it been hotly pursued by interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into com bustion. But the time which Henry had happily gained had contributed to appease the minds of men : The event could not now have the fame in fluence as when it was recent ; and as the clergy every day looked for an accommodation with the king, they had not opposed the pretensions of his partisans, who had been very industrious in repre senting to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the primate, and his ignorance ofthe de signs formed by the assassins. The legates, there fore, found themselves obliged to lower their terms; and Henry was so fortunate as to conclude an ac commodation with them. Fie declared upon oatfy before the reliques of the saints, that, so far from commanding or desiring the death of the archbissiop,^ he was extremely grieved when he received intel ligence of it : But as the passion, which he had ex pressed on account of that prelate's conduct, had probably been the occasion of his murder, he stipu lated the following conditions, as an atonement for the offence. He promised, that he ssiould pardon all such as had been banissied for adhering to Becket; and ssiould restore them to their livings; that the see of Canterbury ssiould be reinstated in all its an cient possessions ; that he ssiould pay the templars a 1 Girald.

Upon signing these concessions, Henry received absolution from the legates, and was confirmed in the grant of Ireland made by pope Adrian h ; and nothing proves more strongly the great abilities of this monarch, than his extricating himself on such easy terms, from so difficult a situ ation. He had always insisted, that the laws esta blissied at Clarendon contained not any new claims, but the ancient customs of the kingdom ; and he was still at liberty, notwithstanding the articles of this agreement, to maintain his pretensions. Ap peals to the pope were indeed permitted by that treaty ; but as the king was also permitted to exact reasonable securities from the parties, and might stretch his demands on this head as far as he pleas ed, he had it virtually in his power to prevent the pope from reaping any advantage by this seeming concession.

Henry, freed from this dangerous controversy with the ecclesiastics, and with the see of Rome, seemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity, and to be equally happy in his domestic situation and in his political govern ment. A numerous progeny of sons and daughters gave both lustre and authority to his crown, pre vented the danger of a disputed succession, and re pressed all pretensions of the ambitious barons. The king's precaution also, in establissiing the seve ral branches of his family, seemed well calculated to prevent all jealousy among the brothers, and to perpetuate the greatness of his family. He had ap pointed Henry, his eldest son, to be his successor in the kingdom of England, the dutchy of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine ; territories which lay contiguous, and which, by that means, might easily lend to each other mutual assistance both against intestine commotions and foreign invasions. Richard, his second son, was in vested in the dutchy of Guienne and county of Poic tou; Geoffrey, his third son, inherited, in right of his wife, the dutchy of Britanny ; and the new con quest of Ireland was destined for the appanage of John, his fourth son. He had also negotiated, in favour of this last prince, a marriage with Adelais, the only daughter of Humbert count of Savoy and Maurienne ; and was to receive as her dowry consi derable demesnes in Piedmont, Savoy, Breffe, and Dauphiny'. But this exaltation of his family ex cited the jealousy of all his neighbours, who made those very sons, whose fortunes he had so anxiously establissied, the means of embittering his future life, and disturbing his government. 1 Ypod.

This faying, which might pals only for an innocent pleasantry, or even for an oblique compliment to his father, was however regarded as a symptom of his aspiring temper; and his conduct soon after justified the conjecture. Henry, agreeably to the promise which he had given both to the pope and French king, permitted his son to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbissiop of Rouen, and associated the princess Margaret, spouse to young Henry, in the cere mony '. He afterwards allowed him to pay a visit to his father-in-law at Paris, who took the oppor tunity of instilling into the young prince those am bitious sentiments to which he was naturally but too much inclined m.

In consequence of these extravagant ideas, young Henry, on his return, desired the king to resign to him either the crown of England, or the dutchy of Normandy ; discovered great discontent on the refusal ; spake in the most undutiful terms of his father; and soon after, in concert with Lewis, made his escape to Paris, where he was protected and supported by that monarch. While Henry was alarmed at this incident, and had the prospect of dangerous intrigues, or even of a war, which, whether successful or not, must be extremely calamitous and disagreeable to him, he received intelligence of new misfortunes, which must have affected him in the most sensible manner. Queen Eleanor, who had disgusted her first hus band by her gallantries, was no less offensive to her second by her jealousy \u2022, and after this manner car ried to extremity, in the different periods of her life, every circumstance of female weakness. She com municated her discontents against Henry to her two younger sons, Geoffrey and Richard; persuaded them that they were also entitled to present possession of the territories assigned to them ; engaged them to fly secretly to the court of France; and was me ditating herself an escape to the same court, and had even put on man's apparel for that purpose ; when ssie was seized by orders from her husoand, and thrown into confinement. Thus Europe saw with astoniftment the best and most indulgent of parents at war with his whole family ; three boys, scarcely arrived at the age of puberty, require a great monarch, in the full vigour of his age and height of his reputation, to dethrone himself in their favour ; and several princes not assiamed to support them in these unnatural and absurd pretensions.

Henry, reduced to this perilous and disagree able situation, had recourse to the court of Rome : Though sensible of the danger attending the inter position of ecclesiastical authority in temporal dis putes, he applied to the pope, as his superior lord, to excommunicate his enemies, and by these cen sures to reduce to obedience his undutiful children, whom he found such reluctance to punissi by the sword of the magistrate n. Alexander, well pleased to exert his power in so justifiable a cause, issued the bulls required of him : But it was soon found, that these spiritual weapons had not the fame force as when employed in a spiritual controversy ; and that the clergy were very negligent in supporting a sentence which was nowise calculated to promote the imme diate interests of their order. The king, after tak ing in vain this humiliating step, was obliged to have recourse to arms, and to enlist such auxili aries, as are the usual resource of tyrants, and have seldom been employed by so wise and just a monarch. The loose government which prevailed in all the states of Europe, the many private wars carried on among the neighbouring nobles, and the impossibi lity of enforcing any general execution ofthe laws, had encouraged a tribe of banditti to disturb every where the public peace, to infest the highways, to pillage the open country, and to brave all the ef forts of the civil magistrate, and even the excom munications of the church, which were fulminated against them\". Troops of them were sometimes enlisted in the service of one prince or baron, some times in that of another : They often acted in an independent manner, under leaders of their own : \"Epist.

Those desperate ruffians re ceived the name sometimes of Brabancons, some times of Routiers or Cottereaux ; but for what rea son is not agreed by historians : And they formed a kind of society or government among themselves, which set at defiance the rest of mankind.

His licentious barons, disgusted with a vigilant government, were more desirous of being ruled by young princes, ignorant of public affairs, remiss in their conduct, and profuse in their grants r ; and as the king had ensured to his sons the succession to every particular province of his do minions, the nobles dreaded no danger in adhering to those who, they knew, must some time become their sovereigns.

Twenty thousand Brabancons, therefore, joined to some troops which he brought over from Ireland, and a few barons of approved fidelity, formed the sole force with which he intended to re sist his enemies. Lewis, in order to bind the confederates in a closer union, summoned at Paris an assembly of the chief vassals of the crown, received their approba tion of his measures, and engaged them by oath to adhere to the cause of young Henry. This prince, in return bound himself by a like tie never to de sert his French allies ; and having made a new great seal, he lavishly distributed among them many considerable parts of those territories which he pur posed to conquer from his father. The counts of Flanders, Boulogne, Blois, and Eu, partly moved by the general jealousy arising from Henry's power and ambition, partly allured by the prospect of reaping advantage from the inconsiderate temper and the necessities of the young prince, declared openly in favour of the latter. William, king of Scotland, had also entered into this great confede racy ; and a plan was concerted for a general inva sion on different parts of the king's extensive and factious dominions. Hostilities were first commenced by the counts of Flanders and Boulogne on the frontiers of Nor mandy. Those princes laid siege to Aumale, which was delivered into their hands by the treachery of the count of that name : This nobleman surren dered himself prisoner ; and on pretence of thereby paying his ransom, opened the gates of all his other fortresses.

In another quarter, the king of France, being strongly assisted by his vassals, assembled a great army of seven thousand knights and their followers on horseback, and a proportionable number of in fantry : Carrying young Henry along with him, he laid siege to Verneuil, which was vigorously de fended by Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de Beauchamp, the governors. After he had lain a month before the place, the garrison, being straitened for provi sions, were obliged to capitulate ; and they enga ged, if not relieved within three days, to surrender the town, and to retire into the citadel. On the last of these days, Henry appeared with his army upon the heights above Verneuil. Lewis, dread ing an attack, sent the archbissiop of Sens and the count of Blois to the Englissi camp, and desired that next day ssiould be appointed for a conference, in order to establissi a general peace, and terminate the difference between Henry and his sons. The king, who passionately desired this accommodation, and suspected no fraud, gave his consent; but Lewis, that morning, obliging the garrison to sur render, according to the capitulation, set fire to the place, and began to retire with his army : Henry, provoked at this artifice, attacked the rear with vigour, put them to rout, did some execution, and took several prisoners. The French army, as their time of service was now expired, immediately dispersed themselves into their several provinces : and left Flenry free to prosecute his advantages against his other enemies. The nobles of Britanny, instigated by the earl pf Chester and Ralph de Fourgeres, were all in arms ; but their progress was checked by a body of Bra bancons, which the king, after Lewis's retreat, had sent against them. The two armies came to an action near Dol ; where the rebels were defeated, fifteen hundred killed on the spot, and the leaders, the earls of Chester and Fourgeres, obliged to take slielter"], [477, "4*1 CHAP.

Henry hastened to form the siege of that place, and carried on the at tack with such ardour, that he obliged the gover nor and garrison to surrender themselves prisoners. By these vigorous measures and happy successes, the insurrections were entirely quelled in Britanny ; and the king, thus fortunate in all quarters, will ingly agreed to a conference with Lewis, in hopes that his enemies, finding all their mighty efforts entirely frustrated, would terminate hostilities on some moderate and reasonable conditions. The two monarchs met between Trie and Gisors ; and Henry had here the mortification to see his three sons in the retinue of his mortal enemy. As Lewis had no other pretence for war than support ing the claims of the young princes, the king made them such offers as children might be assiamed to insist on, and could be extorted from him by no thing but his parental affection, or by the present necessity of his affairs \\ He insisted only on retain ing the sovereign authority in all his dominions ; but offered young Henry half the revenues of Eng land, with some places of surety in that king dom ; or, if he rather chose to reside in Nor mandy, half the revenues of that dutchy, with all - those of Anjou. He made a like offer to Richard in Guienne: he promised to resign Britanny to Geoffrey ; and if these concessions were not deemed sufficient, he agreed to add to them whatever the pope's legates, who were present, ssiould require of him '. The earl of Leicester was also present at the negociation ; and either from the impetuosity of his temper, or from a view of ab ruptly breaking off a conference which must cover the allies with confusion, he gave vent to the most violent reproaches against Henry, and he even put s Hoveden, p. 539.

This furious action threw the whole company into confusion, and put an end to the treaty u. The chief hopes of Henry's enemies seemed now to depend on the state of affairs in England, where his authority was exposed to the most imminent danger. One article of prince Henry's agree ment with his foreign confederates was, that he ssiould resign Kent, with Dover, and all its other fortresses, into the hands of the earl of Flanders w : Yet so little national or public spirit prevailed among the independent Englissi nobility, so wholly bent were they on the aggrandizement each of himself and his own family, that, notwithstanding this pernicious concession, which must have pro duced the ruin of the kingdom, the greater part of them had conspired to make an insurrection, and to support the prince's pretensions. The king's principal resource lay in the church and the bissiops, with whom he was now in perfect agreement ; whe ther that the decency of their character made them assiamed of supporting so unnatural a rebellion, or that they were entirely satisfied with Henry's atone ment for the^murder of Becket, and for his former invasion of ecclesiastical immunities. That prince, however, had resigned none of the essential rights of his crown in the accommodation ; he main tained still the fame prudent jealousy of the court of Rome; admitted no legate into England, with out his swearing to attempt nothing against the. royal prerogatives ; and he had even obliged the monks of Canterbury, who pretended to a free election on the vacancy made by the death of Becket, to chuse Roger, prior of Dover, in the place of that turbulent prelate *. a Hoveden, p. 536. w Ibid. p. 533.

This truce enabled the guardian to march southward with his army, in order to oppose an invasion, which the earl of Leicester, at the head of a great body of Flemings, had made upon Suf folk. The Flemings had been joined by Hugh Bigod, who made them masters of his calile of Framlingham ; and marching into the heart of the kingdom, where they hoped to be supported by Leicester's vassals, they were met by Lucy, who, assisted by Humphry Bohun, the Constable, and the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, and Cornwal, had advanced to Farnham, with a less numerous, but braver army, to oppose them. The Flemings, who were mostly weavers and artificers for manufac tures were now beginning to be establissied in Flanders,) were broken in an instant, ten thousand of them were put to the sword, the earl of Leicester was taken prisoner, and the remains of the invaders were glad to compound for a safe retreat into their own country.

Henry, who had baffled all his enemies in France, and had put his frontiers in a posture of defence, now found England the seat of danger ; and he determined by his presence to overawe the malcontents, or by his conduct and courage to subdue them. He landed at South ampton ; and knowing the influence of superstition over the minds of the people, he hastened to Can terbury, in order to make atonement to the assies of Thomas a Becket, and tender his submissions to a dead enemy. As soon as he came within sight of the church of Canterbury, he dismounted, walked barefoot towards it, prostrated himself before the ssirine of the saint, remained in fasting and prayer during a whole day, aud watched all night the holy reliques. Not content with this hypocritical de votion towards a man, whose violence and ingrati tude had so long disquieted his government, and had been the object of his most inveterate animo sity, he submitted to a penance still more singular and humiliating. He assembled a chapter of the monks, disrobed himself before them, put a scourge of discipline into the hands of each, and presented his bare ssioulders to the lassies which these ecclesiastics successively inflicted upon him. Next day he received absolution; and departing for London, got soon after the agreeable intelligence of a great victory which his generals had obtained over the Scots, and which being gained, as was re ported, on the very day of his absolution, was re- IX. 1174. 8th Jaly.

William king of Scots, though repulsed be fore the castle of Prudhow, and other fortified places, had committed the most horrible depreda tions upon the northern provinces : But on the ap proach of Ralph de Glanville, the famous justi ciary, seconded by Barnard de Baliol, Robert de Stuteville, Odonel de Umfreville, William de Vesci, and other northern barons, together with the gal lant bissiop of Lincoln, he thought proper to re treat nearer his own country, and he fixed his camp at Alnwic. He had here weakened his army ex tremely, by sending out numerous detachments in order to extend his ravages ; and he lay absolutely safe, as he imagined, from any attack of the ene my. But Glanville, informed of his situation, made a hasty and fatiguing march to Newcastle ; and allowing his soldiers only a small interval for refressiment, he immediately set out towards even ing for Alnwic. He marched that night above thirty miles ; arrived in the morning, under cover of a mist, near the Scottissi camp : and regard less of the great numbers of the enemy, he be gan the attack with his small but determined body of cavalry. William was living in such supine se curity, that he took the Englissi, at first, for a body os his own ravagers, who were returning to the camp : But the sight of their banners convin cing him of his mistake, he entered on the action with no greater body than a hundred horse, in con fidence that the numerous army which surrounded him would soon hasten to his relief. He was dis mounted on the first ssiock, and taken prisoner ; while his troops, hearing of this disaster, fled on all sides with the utmost precipitation.

The bissiop of Dur ham, who was preparing to revolt, made his sub missions ; Hugh Bigod, though he had received a strong reinforcement of Flemings, was obliged to surrender all his castles, and throw himself on the king's mercy; no better resource was left to the earl of V errars and Roger de Moubray ; the inferior rebels imitating rhe example, all England was re stored to tranquillity in a few weeks ; and as the king appeared to lie under the immediate protec tion of Heaven, it was deemed impious any longer to resist him. The clergy exalted anew the merits and powerful intercession of Becket ; and Henry, instead of opposing this superstition, plumed him self on the new friendssiip of the saint, and propa gated an opinion which was so favourable to his interests z. Prince Henry, who was ready to embark at Gravelines, with the earl of Flanders and a great army, hearing that his partisans in England were suppressed, abandoned all thoughts of the enter prise, and joined the camp of Lewis, who, during the absence ofthe king, had made an irruption into Normandy, and had laid siege to Rouen a. The place was defended with great vigour by the inha bitantsb; and Lewis, despairing of success by open force, tried to gain the town by a stratagem, which, in that superstitious age, was deemed not very ho nourable. He proclaimed in his own camp a ces sation of arms, on pretence of celebrating the festi val of St. Laurence ; and when the citizens, sup posing themselves in safety, were so imprudent as to remit their guard, he purposed to take advantage 1 Hoveden, p. c.39. k Diceto, p. 578. * Brompton, p. 1096.

Happily, some priests had, from mere curiosity, mounted a steeple, where the alarm bell hung ; and observing the French camp in mo tion, they immediately rang the bell, and gave warning to the inhabitants, who ran to their se veral stations. The French, who, on hearing the alarm, hurried to the assault, had already mounted the walls in several places ; but being repulsed by the enraged citizens, were obliged to retreat with considerable loss c. Next day Henry, who had hastened to the defence of his Norman dominions, passed over the bridge in triumph ; and entered Rouen in sight of the French army. The city was now in absolute safety ; and the king, in order to brave the French monarch, commanded the gates, which had been walled up, to be opened; and he prepared to pussi his advantages against the enemy. Lewis saved himself from this perilous situation by a new piece of deceit not so justifiable. He pro posed a conference for adjusting the terms of a ge neral peace, which he knew would be greedily em braced by Henry ; and while the king of England trusted to the execution of his promise, he made a retreat with his army into France. There was, however, a necessity on both sides for an accommodation. Henry could no longer bear to see his three sons in the hands of his ene my; and Lewis dreaded, lest this great monarch, victorious in all quarters, crowned with glory, and absolute master of his dominions, might take re venge for the many dangers and disquietudes which the arms, and still more the intrigues of France, had, in his disputes both with Becket and his sons, found means to raise him. After making a cessa tion of arms, a conference was agreed on near Touri ; where Henry granted his sons much less advantageous terms than he had formerly offered ; and he received their submissions.

The provisions which he made, show such largeness of thought as qualified him for being a legislator ; and they were commonly calculated as well for the future as the present happiness of his kingdom. He enacted severe penalties against robbery, murder, false coining, arson ; and ordained that these crimes should be punissied by the amputation ofthe right hand and right foot \\ The pecuniary commutationfor crimes, which has a false appearance of lenity, had been gradually disused ; and seems to have been entirely abolished by the rigour of these statutes.

All advances towards reason and good sense are flow and gradual. Henry, though sensible ofthe great absurdity attending the trial by duel or battle, did not venture to abolissi it : He only admitted either ofthe parties to challenge a trial by an assize or jury of twelve freeholders ': This latter method of trial seems to have been very ancient in England, and was fixed by the laws of king Alfred : But the barbarous and violent genius of the age had of late given more credit to the trial by battle, which had become the general method of deciding allimportant controversies. It was never abolissied by law in England ; and there is an instance of it so late as the reign of Elizabeth : But the institution revived by this king, being found more reasonable and more suitable to a civilized people, gradually prevailed over it. The partition of England into four divisions, and the appointment of itinerant justices to go the cir cuit in each division, and to decide the causes in the counties, was another important ordinance of this prince, which had a direct tendency to curb the oppressive barons, and to protect the inferior' gentry and common people in their property m.

Every man possessed of a knight's fee was ordained to have for each fee a coat of mail, a helmet, a shield, and a lance ; every free layman, possessed of goods to the value of six seen marks, was to be armed in like manner ; every one that possessed ten marks was obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a lance ; all bur gesses were to have a cap of iron, a lance, and a wambais ; that is, a coat quilted with wool, tow, or such like materials \u00b0. It appears that archery, for which the Englissi were afterwards so renowned, had not, at this time, become very common among them. The spear was the chief weapon employed in battle. The clergy and the laity were, during that age, in a strange situation with regard to each other, and such as may seem totally incompatible with a civi lized, and indeed with any species of government. Isa clergyman were guilty of murder, he could be punissied by degradation only : If he were mur dered, the murderer was exposed to nothing but excommunication and ecclesiastical censures ; and the crime was atoned for by penances and submis sion p.

It was not till they found their pre sence ssiunned by every one as excommunicated persons that they were induced to take a journey to Rome, to throw themselves at the feet of the pontiff, and to submit to the penances imposed upon them : After which, they continued to possess, without molestation, their honours and fortunes, and seem even to have recovered the countenance and good opinion of the public. But as the king, by the constitutions of Clarendon, which he en deavoured still to maintain 9, had subjected1 the clergy to a trial by the civil magistrate, it seemed but just to give them the protection of that power to which they owed obedience-: It was enacted, that the murderers of clergymen ssiould be tried before the justiciary, in the presence of the bissiop or his official ; and besides the usual punissiment for mur der, ssiould be subjected to a forfeiture of their estates, and a confiscation of their goods and chat tels '. The king passed an equitable law, that the goods of a vassal ssiould not be seized for the debt of his lord, unless the vassal be surety for the debt ; and that the rents of vassals ssiould be paid to the ere-. ditors of the ford, not to the lord himself. It is remarkable that this law was enacted by the king in a council which he held at Verneuil, and which consisted of some prelates and barons of England, as well as some of Normandy, Poictou, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Britanny ; and the statute took place in all these last-mentioned territories s, 1 Chron.

If the prince was hated or despis ed ; if the nobles who supported him had small in fluence ; if the humours of the times disposed the people to question the justice of his ordinance ; the fullest and most authentic assembly had no authority. Thus all was confusion and disorder; no regular idea of a constitution ; force and violence decided every thing.

The monks, sensible that their faint's ho nour was concerned in the case, failed not to pub lissi that Lewis's prayers were answered, and that the young prince was restored to health by Becket's intercession. That king himself was soon after struck with an apoplexy, which deprived him of his understanding: Philip, though a youth of fifteen, took on him the administration, till his father's death, which happened soon after, opened his way to the throne ; and he proved the ablest and great est monarch that had governed that kingdom since the age of Charlemagne. The superior years, how ever, and experience of Henry, while they mode rated his ambition, gave him such an ascendant over this prince, that no dangerous rivalssiip, for a long time, arose between them. The Englissi monarch, instead of taking advantage of his own situation, ra ther employed his good offices in composing the quarrels which arose in the royal family of France; and he was successful in mediating a reconciliation between Philip and his mother and uncles. These services were but ill requited by Philip, who, when he came to man's estate, fomented all the domestic discords in the royal family of England, and encour raged Henry's sons in their ungrateful and undutiful Behaviour towards him. Prince Henry, equally impatient of obtaining power, and incapable of using it, renewed to the king the demand of his resigning Normandy ; and on meeting with a refusal, he fled with his consort to the court of France : But not finding Philip at that time disposed to enter into war for his fake, he accepted of his father's offers of reconciliation, and made"], [491, "HENRY II. 455 made him submissions.

Richard, whom he had made master of Guienne, and who had displayed his valour and military genius by suppressing the revolts of his mutinous barons, refused to obey Henry's orders, in doing homage to his elder brother for that dutchy ; and he defended himself against young Henry and Geoffrey, who, uniting their arms, carried war into his territories u. The king, with some difficulty, composed their difference ; but immediately found his eldest son engaged in con- spiracies, and ready to take arms against himself.

But the rivalssiip between these potent princes, and all their inferior interest, seemed now to have given place to the general passion for the relief of the holy land, and the expulsion of the Saracens. Those infidels, though obliged to yield to the im mense inundation of Christians in the first crusade, had recovered courage after the torrent was past ; and attacking on all quarters the settlements of the Europeans, had reduced these adventurers to great difficulties, and obliged them to apply again for succours from the West. A second crusade, under the emperor Conrade, and Lewis VII. king of France, in which there periihed above 2co,coo men, brought them but a temporary relief; and those princes, after losing such immense armies, and see ing the flower of their nobility fall by their side, re turned with little honour into Europe. But these repeated misfortunes, which drained the western world of its people and treasure, were not yet suf ficient to cure men of their passion for those spiritual adventures ; and a new incident rekindled with fressi fury the zeal of the ecclesiastics and military adventurers among the Latin Christians. Saladin, a prince of great generosity, bravery, and conduct, having fixed himself on the throne of Egypt, began to extend his conquests over the east ; and finding the settlement of the Christians in Palestine an in vincible obstacle to the progress of his arms, he bent the whole force, of his policy and valour tp subdue that small and barren, but important terri tory Taking advantage of dissensions which pre vailed among the champions of the cross, and hav ing secretly gained the count of Tripoli, who com manded their armies, he invaded the frontiers with a mighty power ; and, aided by the treachery of that"], [494, "458 HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

The holy city itself fell into his hands, after a feeble re sistance ; the kingdom of Antioch was almost en tirely subdued ; and except some maritime towns, nothing considerable remained of those boasted con quests, which, near a century before, it had cost the efforts of all Europe to acquire z. The western Christians were astonissied on re ceiving this dismal intelligence. Pope Urban III. it is pretended, died of grief; and his successor, Gregory VIII. employed the whose time of his ssiort pontificate in rousing to arms all the Christians who acknowledged his authority. The general cry was, that they were unworthy of enjoying any in? heritance in heaven, who did not vindicate from the dominion of the infidels the inheritance of God on earth, and deliver from slavery that country which had been consecrated by the footsteps of their Redeemer. William archbissiop of Tyre, having procured a conference between Henry and Philip near Gisors, enforced all these topics ; gave a par thetic description ofthe miserable state of the eastern Christians; and employed every argument to ex cite the ruling passions of the age, superstition, and jealousy of military honour a. The two monarchs immediately took the cross ; many of their most considerable vassals imitated the example b ; and as the emperor Frederic I. entered into the fame con? federacy, some well-grounded hopes of success were entertained ; and men flattered themselves, that an enterprise which had failed under the conduct of many independent leaders, or of imprudent princes, might at last, by the efforts of soch potent and able monarchs, be brought to a happy issue. * M.

This backwardness of the clergy is perhaps a symptom, that the enthusi astic ardour which had at first seized the people for crusades, was now by time and ill success consider ably abated ; and that the phrenzy was chiefly sup ported by the military genius and love of glory in the monarchs. But before this great machine could be put in motion, there were still many obstacles to surmount. Philip, jealous of Henry's power, entered into a private confederacy with young Richard ; and, workinc on his ambitious and impatient temper, persuaded him, instead of supporting and aggran dising that monarchy which he was one day to in herit, to seek present power and independence by disturbing and dismembering ir. In order to give a pretence for hostilities between the two kings, Richard broke into the territories of Raymond count of Toulouse, who immediately carried com plaints of this violence before the king of France as his superior lord. Philip remonstrated with Henry ; but received for answer, that Richard had confessed to the archbissiop of Dublin, that his en terprise against Raymond had been undertaken by the approbation of Philip himself, and was con ducted by his authority.

Henry retaliated by making inroads upon the frontiers of France, and burning Dreux. As this war, which destroyed all hopes of success in the projected crusade, gave great scandal, the two kings held a conference at the accustomed place between Gisors and Trie, in order to find means of accommodating their differences : They separated on worse terms than before ; and Philip, to ssiew his disgust, ordered a great elm, under which the conferences had usually been held, to be cut down f; as if he had renounced all desire of accommodation, and was determined to carry the war to extremities against the king of England. But his own vassals refused to serve under him in so in vidious a cause E ; and he was obliged to come anew to a conference with Henry, and to offer terms of peace. These terms were such as entirely opened the eyes of the king of England, and fully con vinced him of the perfidy of his son, and his secret alliance with Philip, of which he had before only entertained some suspicion. The king of France required that Richard should be crowned king of England in the lifetime of his father, ssiould be in vested in all his transmarine dominions, and ssiould immediately espouse Alice, Philip's sister, to whom he had formerly been affianced, and who had al ready been conducted into England11.

Several historians assert, that Henry himself had become enamoured of young Alice, and mention this as an additional rea son for his refusing these conditions: But he had so many other just and equitable motives for his con duct, that it is superfluous to assign a cause, which the great prudence and advanced age of that mo narch rendered somewhat improbable. Cardinal Albano, the pope's legate, displeased with these increasing obstacles to the crusade, ex communicated Richard, as the chief spring of dis cord : But the sentence of excommunication,which, when it was properly prepared, and was zealously supported by the clergy, had often great influence in that age, proved entirely ineffectual in the pre sent case. The chief barons of Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being attached to the young prince, and finding that he had now received the investiture from their superior lord, declared for him, and made inroads into the territories of such as still adhered to the king. Henry, disquieted by the daily revolts of his mutinous subjects, and dreading still worse effects from their turbulent dis position, had again recourse to papal authority ; and engaged the cardinal Anagni, who had succeeded Albano in the legatessiip, to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his dominions. But Phi lip, who was a prince of great vigour and capacity, despised the menace, and told Anagni, that it be longed not to the pope to interpose in the temporal disputes of princes, much less in those between him and his rebellious vassal.

Richard, still more outrageous, offered to draw his sword against the legate, and was hindred by the interposition alone of the company, from committing violence upon him1.

While he was in this state of despond ency, the duke of Burgundy, the earl of Flanders, and the archbissiop of Rheims, interposed with their good offices; and the intelligence which he receiv ed of the taking of Tours, and which made him fully sensible of the desperate situation of his affairs, so subdued his spirit that he submitted to all the ri gorous terms which were imposed upon him. He agreed, that Richard ssiould marry the princess Alice ; that that prince ssiould receive the homage and oath of fealty of all his subjects both in Eng land and his transmarine dominions; that he himself ssiould pay twenty thousand marks to the king of France as a compensation for the charges of the war; that his own barons ssiould engage to make him observe this treaty by force, and in case of his vio lating it, should promise to join Philip and Richard against him ; and that all his vassals who had en- 1 M.

Bur the mortification which Henry, who had been accustomed to give the law in most treaties, re ceived from these disadvantageous terms, was the least that he met with on this occasion. When he de manded a list of those barons to whom he was bound to grant a pardon for their connections with Richard, he was astonissied to find at the head of them the name of his second son John \u00b0 ; who had always been his favourite, whose interests he had ever anxiously at heart, and who had even, on ac count of his ascendant over him, often excited the jealousy of Richardp.

The more his heart was disposed to friendship and affection, the more he resented the barbarous return which his four sons had successively made to his parental care ; and this finissiing blow, by depriving him of every comfort in life, quite broke his spirit, and threw him into a lingering sever, of which he expired at the castle of Chinon near Saumur. His natural son Geoffrey, who alone had behaved dutifully towards him, attended his corpse to the nunnery of Fontervrault; where it lay in state in the abbey church.

When he could enjoy leisure, he recreated himself either in learned conversation or in reading ; and he cultivated his natural talents by study, above any prince of his time.

This prince, like most of his predecessors of the Norman line, except Stephen, passed more of his time on the continent than in this island : He was surrounded with the Englissi gentry and nobility, when abroad : The French gentry and nobility at tended him when he resided in England : Both na tions acted in the government as if they were the fame people ; and, on many occasions, the legisla tures seem not to have been distinguissied. As the king and all the Englissi barons were of French ex traction, the manners of that people acquired the as cendant, and were regarded as the models of imi tation. All foreign improvements, therefore, such as they were, in literature and politeness, in laws and arts, seem now to have been, in a good mea sure transplanted into England ; and that kingdom was become little inferior in all the fassiionable ac complissiments, to any of its neighbours on the con tinent. The more homely but more sensible man ners and principles ofthe Saxons, were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the fubtilties of school philosophy : The feudal ideas of civil govern ment, the Romissi sentiments in religion, had taken entire possession of the people : By the former, the sense of submission towards princes was somewhat diminished in the barons ; by the latter, the devoted attachment to papal authority was much augmented among the clergy.

They aspired to the same liberty and in dependence which they saw -enjoyed by their bre thren on the continent, and desired to restrain those exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the necessities of war and the violence of conquest had at first obliged them to indulge in their monarch. That memory also of a more equal government under the Saxon princes, which re mained with the Englissi, diffused still farther the spirit of liberty, and made the barons both desirous of more independence to themselves, and willing to indulge it to the people. And it was not long ere this secret revolution in the sentiments of men pro duced, first violent convulsions in the state, then an evident alteration in the maxims of government. The history of all the preceding kings of Eng land since the conquest, gives evident proofs ofthe disorders attending the feudal institutions ; the li centiousness of the barons, their spirit of rebellion against the prince and laws, and of animosity against each other : The conduct of the barons in the transmarine dominions of those monarchs, af forded perhaps still more flagrant instances of these convulsions ; and the history of France, during seve ral ages, consists almost entirely of narrations of this nature. The cities, during the continuance of this violent government, could neither be very nume rous nor populous; and there occur instances which seem to evince, that, though these are always the first seat of law and liberty, their police was in ge neral loose and irregular, and exposed to the fame disorders with those by which the country was ge nerally infested.

By these crimes, it had become so dangerous to walk the streets by night, that the citizens durst no more venture abroad after fun-set, than if they had been exposed to the incur sions of a public enemy. The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been murdered by some of those nocturnal rioters ; and the death of so eminent a person, which was much more regarded than that of many thousands of an inferior station, so pro voked the king, that he swore vengeance against the criminals, and became thenceforth more rigorous in the execution ofthe Laws '\". There is another instance given by historians, which proves to what a height such riots had pro ceeded, and how open these criminals were in com mitting their robberies.

Henry's care in administering justice had gained him so great a reputation, that even foreign and distant princes made him arbiter, and submitted their differences to his judgment. Sanchez king of Navarre, having some controversies with Alphonso king of Castile, was contented, though Alphonso had married the daughter of Henry, to chuse this prince for a referee ; and they agreed, each of them to consign three castles into neutral hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his award. Henry made the cause be examined before his great coun cil, and gave a sentence, which was submitted to by both parties. These two Spanissi kings sent each a stout champion to the court of England, in order to defend his cause by arms, in case the way of duel had been chosen by Henry y. Henry so far abolissied the barbarous and absurd practice of confiscating ships which had been wrecked on the coast, that he ordained, if one man or animal were alive in the fliip, that the vessel and goods ssiould be restored to the owners z. The reign of Henry was remarkable also for an innovation which was afterwards carried farther by his successors, and was attended with the most im portant consequences. This prince was disgusted with the species of military force which was esta blissied by the feudal institutions, and which, though it was extremely burdensome to the subject, yet ren dered very little service to the sovereign. The ba rons, or military tenants, came late into the field ; \"Observations on the ancient Statutes, p. 216. ' Rymer, vol. iv. .p. 43. Bened. Abb. p. 172. Diceto, p. 597.

Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of making a com mutation of their military service for money ; and he levied scutagesfrom his baronies and knights fees, instead of requiring the personal attendance of his vassals. There is mention made, in the history of the exchequer, of these seutages in his second, fifth, and eighteenth year * ; and other writers give us an account of three more of them b. When the prince had thus obtained money, he made a contract with some of those adventurers in which Europe at that time abounded : They found him soldiers of the fame character with themselves, who were bound to serve for a stipulated time : The armies were less numerous, but more useful than when composed of all the military vassals of the crown : The feu dal institutions began to relax : The kings became rapacious for money, on which all their power de pended : The barons, seeing no end of exactions, sought to defend their property : And as the fame causes had nearly the fame effects in the different countries of Europe, the several crowns either lost or acquired authority, according to their different success in the contest. This prince was also the first that levied a tax on the moveables or personal estates of his subjects, nobles as well as commons. Their zeal for the holy wars made them submit to this innovation ; and a precedent being once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns, the usual method of supplying the necessities of the crown.

Flenry, after the first years of his reign, never renewed this ceremony, which was found to be very expensive and very useless. None of his successors revived it. It is considered as a great act of grace in this prince, that he mitigated the rigour ofthe forest laws, and punissied any trans gressions of them, not capitally, but by fines, im prisonments, and other more moderate penalties. Since we are here collecting some detached'in cidents, which ssiow the genius of the age, and which could not so well enter into the body of our historv, it may not be improper to mention the quarrel between Roger archbissiop of York, and Richard archbissiop of Canterbury. We may judge of the violence of military men and laymen, when ecclesiastics could proceed to such extremities. Cardinal Haguezun being sent, in 1176, as legate into Britain, summoned an assembly of the clergy at London ; and as both the archbissiops pretended to sit on his right hand, this question of precedency begat a controversy between them. The monks and retainers of archbissiop Richard fell upon Ro ger, in the presence of the cardinal and of the synod, threw him to the ground, trampled him under soot, and so bruised him with blows, that he was taken up half dead, and his life was, with difficulty, saved from their violence- The archbissiop of Can terbury was obliged to pay a large sum of money to the legate, in order to suppress all complaints with regard to this enormity c.

Henry is said by ancient historians to have been of a very amorous disposition : They mention two of his natural sons by Rosamond, daughter of lord Clifford ; namely, Richard Longespee, or Long sword (so called from the sword he usually wore), who was afterwards married to Ela, the daughter and heir of the earl of Salisbury ; and Geoffrey, first bissiop of Lincoln, then archbishop of York.

'T'HIS question has been disputed with as great zeal -*- and even acrimony, between the Scotch and Irish antiquaries, as if the honour of their respective countries were the most deeply concerned in the decision. We shall not enter into any detail on so uninteresting a subject ; but fliall propose our opinion in a few words. It appears more than probable, from the similitude of language and man ners, that Britain either was originally peopled, or was subdued, by the migration of inhabitants from Gaul, and Ireland from Britain: The position ofthe several countries is an additional reason that favours this conclusion. It ap pears also probable, that the migrations of that colony of Gauls or Celts, who peopled or subdued Ireland, was originally made from the north-west parts of Britain ; and this conjecture (if it do not merit a higher name) is founded both on the Irish language, which is a very dif ferent dialect from the Wellh, and from the language an ciently spoken in South Britain, and on the vicinity of Lancassiire, Cumberland, Galloway, and Argylefhire, to that Island. These events, as they passed long be fore the age of history and records, must be known by reasoning alone, which in this cafe seems to be pretty satisfactory : C\u00e6sar and Tacitus, not to mention a mul titude of other Greek and Roman authors, were guided by like inferences. But besides these primitive facts, which lie in a very remote antiquity, it is a matter of positive and undoubted testimony, that the Roman province of Britain, during the time of the lower empire, was much infested by bands of robbers or pirates, whom the provin- cial"], [510, "NOTES TO THE FIRST VOLUME. 474 cial Britons called Scots or Scuits ; a name which was probably used as a term of reproach, and which these ban ditti themselves did not acknowledge or assume. We may infer from two passages in Claudian, and from one in Orosius, and another in Isidore, that the chief feat of these Scots was in Ireland. That some part of the Irish free booters migrated back to the north-west parts of Britain, whence their ancestors had probably been derived in a more remote age, is positively asserted by Bede, and im plied in Gildas. 1 gram, that neither Bede nor Gildas are C\u00e6sars or Tacitufes; but such as they are, they re main the sole testimony on the subject, and therefore must be relied on for want of better : Happily, the frivolousness of the question corresponds to the weakness of the autho rities. Not to mention, that, if any part of the traditional history of a barbarous people can be relied on, it is the ge nealogy of nations, and even sometimes that of families. It is in vain to argue against these facts from the supposed warlike disposition of the Highlanders, and unwarlike of the ancient Irish. Those arguments are still much weaker than the authorities. Nations change very quickly in these particulars. The Britons were unable to resist the Picts and Scots, and invited over the Saxons for their de fence, who repelled those invaders: Yet the fame Britons Taliantly resisted for 150 years, not only this victorious band of Sasons, but infinite numbers more, who poured in upon them from all quarters. Robert Bruce in 1322, made a peace, in which England, after many defeats, was constrained to acknowledge the independence of his coun try: Yet in no more distant period than ten years after, Scotland was totally subdued by a small handful of English, led by a few private noblemen. All history is full of such events. The Irish Scots, in the course of two or three centuries, might sind time and opportunities sufficient to settle in North Britain, though we can neither assign the period nor causes of that revolution. Their barbarous manner of life rendered them much sitter than the Romans for subduing these mountaineers. And, in a word, it is clear, from the language of the two countries, that the Highlanders and the Irissi are the fame people, and that the one are a colony from the other. We have positive evidence, which, though from neutral persons, is not perhaps the best that may be wistied for, that the former, in the third or fourth century, sprang from the latter : We have"], [511, "47J NOTES TO THE FIRST VOLUME. have no evidence at all that the latter sprang from the for mer. I mall add, that the name of Erse or Irish, given by the low country Scots to the language of the Scotch High landers, is a certain proof of the traditional opinion deli vered from father to son, that the latter people came origi nally from Ireland. NOTE [B], p. 117. 'T'HERE is a seeming contradiction in ancient histo- -*\u25a0 rians with regard to some circumstances in the story of Edwy and Elgiva. It is agreed, that this prince had a violent passion for his second or third cousin, Elgiva, whom he married, though within the degrees prohibited by the canons. It is also agreed, that he was dragged from a lady on the day of his coronation, and that the lady was after wards treated with the singular barbarity above mentioned. The only difference is, that Osborne and some others call her his strumpet, not his wife, as ssie is said to be by Malmefbury. But this difference is easily reconciled: For if Edwy married her contrary to the canons, the monks would be sure to deny her to be his wife, and would insist that ssie could be nothing but his strumpet : So that, on the whole, we may esteem this representation os the matter as certain ; at least, as by far the most probable. If Edwy had only kept a mistress, it is well known, that there are methods of accommodation with the church, which would have prevented the clergy from proceeding to such extre mities against him : But his marriage, contrary to the ca nons, was an insult on their authority, and called for their highest resentment.

Brompton, p. 869, fays, that Edgar had 4000 vessels. How can these accounts be re conciled to probability, and to the state of the navy in the rime of Alfred ? W.

The fleet of"], [512, "4;6 NOTES TO THE FIRST VOLUME. of Ethelred, Edgar's son, must have been ssiort of 1000 ships ; yet the Saxon Chronicle, p. 13 7, fays, it was the greatest navy that ever had been seen in England.

A LMOST all the ancient historians speak of this -^*- massacre of the Danes as if it had been universal, and as if every individual of that nation throughout Eng land had been put to death. But the Danes were almost the. sole inhabitants in the kingdoms of Northumberland and East Anglia, and were very numerous in Mercia. This representation, therefore, of the matter is absolutely im possible. Great resistance must have been made, and violent wars ensued ; which was not the cafe. This account given by Wallingford, though he stands single, must be admitted as the only true one. We are told that the name Lur dane, lord Dane, for an idle lazy fellow, who lives at other people's expence, came from the conduct of the Danes, who were put to death. But the English princes had been entirely masters for several generations ; and only sup ported a military corps of that nation. It seems probable, therefore, that it was these Danes only that were put to death.

I have followed the account which appeared to me the most consistent and probable. It does not seem likely, that Ed ward ever executed a will in the duke's favour, much less that he got it ratified by the states of the kingdom, as is affirmed by some. The will would have been known to all, and would have been produced by the Conqueror, to whom it gave so plausible, and really so just a title ; but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he seems always to have mentioned it, proves that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favour, which he was desirous to call a will. There is indeed a charter of the Conqueror preserved by Dr. Hickes, vol. i. where he calls himself rex hereditarius, meaning heir by will; but a prince possessed of so much power, and attended with so much success, may employ what pretence he pleases : It is sufficient to refute his pretences to observe, that there is a great difference and variation among historians, with re gard to a point which, had it been real, must have been agreed upon by all of them. Again, some historians, particularly Malmefbury and Matthew of Westminster, affirm that Harold had no in tention' of going over to Normandy, but that taking the air in a pleasure-boat on the coast, he was driven over by stress of weather to the territories of Guy count of Ponthieu : But besides that this story is not probable in itself, and is contradicted by most of the ancient historians, it is contra dicted by a very curious and authentic monument lately dis covered. It is a tapestry, preserved in the ducal palace of Rouen, and supposed to have been wrought by orders of Matilda, wife to the emperor: At least it is of very great antiquity. Harold is there represented as taking his de parture from king Edward in execution of some commis sion, and mounting his vessel with a great train. The de sign of redeeming his brother and nephew, who were hostages, is the most likely cause that can be assigned; and is accordingly mentioned by Eadmer, Hoveden, Bromp ton, and Simeon of Durham.

TT appears from the ancient translations of the Saxon \u25a0*- annals and laws, and from king Alfred's translation of Bede, as well as from all the ancient historians, that comes m Latin, alderman in Saxon, and earl in Dano-Saxon, were quite synonimous. There is only a clause in a law of king Athelstan's, (fee Spelm. Cone. p. 406.) which has stum bled some antiquaries, and has made them imagine that an earl was superior to an alderman. The weregild, or the price of an earl's blood, is there fixed at 15,000 thrimfas, equal to that of an archbishop; whereas that of a bishop and alderman is only 8000 thrimfas. To solve this diffi culty we must have recourse to Selden's conjecture (fee his Titles of Flonour, chap. v. p. 603, 604.) that the term of earl was in the age of Athelstan just beginning to be in use in England, and stood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of Canute, \u00a7 55. where an atheling and an arch bifliop are put upon the fame sooting. In another law of the same Athelstan the weregild ofthe prince or atheling is said to be rj,oco thrimfas. See Wilkins, p. 71. He is therefore the fame who is called earl in the former law.

If there were the least concurrence or opposition, it was always supposed that the civil powerwas to give way: Every deed, which had the least pretence of holding of any thing spiritual, as marriages, testaments, promissory oaths, were brought into the spiritual court, and could not be can* vassed before a civil magistrate. These were the establissied laws of the church ; and where a legate was sent immedi ately from Rome, he was sure to maintain the papal claims with the utmost rigour : But it was an advantage to the king to have the archbissiop of Canterbury appointed le gate, because the connections of that prelate with the king dom tended to moderate his measures.

Lord Lyttleton chuses to follow the authority of a manuscript letter, or rather manifesto, of Folliot, bishop of London, which is addressed to Becket himself, at the time when the bishop appealed to the pope from the excommunication pro nounced against him by his primate. My reasons, why I give the preference to Fitz-Stephens, are, (1.) If ssie friendship of Fitz-Stephens might render him partial to Becket, even after the death of that prelate, the declared enmity of the bishop must, during his life-time, have ren dered him more partial on the other side. (2.) The bist.op was moved by interest, as well as enmity, to calumniate Becket. He had himself to defend against the sentence of excommunication, dreadful to all, especially to a prelate : And ?io more effectual means than to throw all the blame O'i"], [519, "4*3 NOTES TO THE FIRST VOLUME. On his adversary. (3.) He has actually been guilty of palpable calumnies in that letter. Among these, I reckon the following ; He affirms, that, when Becket subscribed the Constitutions of Clarendon, he said plainly to all the bissiops of England, It us my master's pleasure that Istould forswear myself, and at present I submit to it, and do resolve to incur a perjury, and repent after-wards as I may. How ever barbarous the times, and however negligent zealou3 churchmen were then of morality, these are not words which a primate of great fense, and of much seeming sanc tity, would employ in an assembly of his suffragans : He might act upon these principles, but never surely would publicly avow them. Folliot also says, that all the biffiops were resolved obstinately to oppose the Constitutions of Clarendon, but the primate himself betrayed them from timidity, and led the way to their subscribing. This is contrary to the testimony of ail the historians, and directly contrary to Becket's character, who surely was not desti tute either of courage or of zeal for ecclesiastical immuni ties. (4.) The violence and injustice of Henry, ascribed to him by Fitz -Stephens, is of a piece with the reft of the prosecution. Nothing could be more iniquitous, than, after two years' silence, to make a sudden and unprepared demand upon Becket to the amount of 44,000 marks (equal to a sum of near a million in our time), and not al- low him the least interval to bring in his accounts. If the king was so palpably oppressive in one article, he may be presumed to be equally so in the rest. (5.) Though Fol- liot's letter, or rather manifesto, be addressed to Becket himself, it does not acquire more authority on that ac- count. We know not what answer was made by Becket : The collection of letters cannot be supposed quite complete. But that the collection was not made by one (whoever he were) very partial to that primate, appears from the tenor of them, where there arc many passages very little favour- able to him : Insomuch that the editor of them at Brussels, a Jesuit, thought proper to publish them with great omis- sions, particularly of this letter of Folliot's. Perhaps Becket made no answer at all, as not deigning to write to an excommunicated person, whole very commerce would contaminate him ; and the bishop, trusting to this arro- gance of his primate, might calumniate him the more freely.
