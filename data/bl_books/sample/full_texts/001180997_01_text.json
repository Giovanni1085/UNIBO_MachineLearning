From The Fern Paradise, by Francis George Heath. 5th Edition. London: Sampson Low & Co. 1878. \" Amidst all our English counties, Devonshire stands unrivalled for the exquisite loveliness of its scenery. Few of those who have climbed its bold heights, crossed its"], [23, "SWEET DEVON. 9 rugged moorlands, and wandered through its shady woods and its delightful green lanes, will be inclined to dispute this assertion, however familiar they may be with English landscapes. It is the marvellous variety of its scenery which constitutes the peculiar charm of this county \u2014 the rugged boldness of its many hills contrasting with the soft grace of its valleys. Its majestic coast lines tower defiantly against the sky, both on its north and its south seaboard \u2014 now frowning with barren but lofty grandeur at the waves, now clothed from the highest point of the cliff to the water's edge with one deep dark mass of vegetation. But there is not even a grand monotony in the lines of noble cliffs along the coasts of Devonshire. There is no monotony at all ; for the grand rocks sink at intervals, to give place to magnificent bays, which sweep gracefully from cliff's point to cliff's point, and help to fling over the coast scenery of this, the most beautiful of English counties, the same aspect of variety which is its most charming characteristic. Those only who have explored the Devonshire coast along the Bristol Channel on the north, and along the English Channel on the south, and who are also familiar with the interior of the county, can properly realise the extreme magnificence of its landscapes. But we believe that thousands of the tourists who annually visit the western ' Garden of England ' \u2014 for Devonshire well deserves that appellation \u2014 whilst deeply impressed with the general love liness of the county, nevertheless find it difficult to explain what it is that lends the peculiar character of softness and grace to the scenery. Here is the secret. The whole county is richly and luxuriantly clothed with Ferns. The number and variety of the most exquisite forms of these beautiful plants to be found in Devonshire are equalled by those of"], [24, "SWEET DEVON. 10 no other county in the United Kingdom. Devonshire is emphatically the 'paradise' of the British Ferns. There they are in very truth at home. The soil and the air are adapted to them, and they adapt themselves to the whole aspect of the place. They clothe its hill-sides and its hill tops ; they grow in the moist depths of its valleys ; they fringe the banks of its streams ; they are to be found in the recesses of its woods ; they hang from rocks and walls and trees, and crowd into the towns and villages, fastening themselves with sweet familiarity even to the houses. Devonshire abounds in warm, moist, and shady nooks ; and Ferns delight in warmth, moisture, and shade. Though they love the warmth, they avoid the sun, and when acci dentally exposed to its full influence, their delicate fronds become shrivelled and discoloured. Yet these beautiful plants do occasionally coquet with the tiny sunbeam which may perchance find its way through some crevice in their cool rocky home, or through the thick foliage of the hedge row under whose darkest shade they love to grow. But even the Ferns are changeable in their moods, and fickle in their attachments, differing from one another in their habits and modes of growth. Some members of the lovely family will boldly grow in situations where, perched on rocky corners, away from the cool shelter of overhanging shrubs, they are exposed to the full blaze of the sun, and roughly blown upon by the wild force of the wind. Others only seek to bathe the tips of their delicate fronds in sunshine, hiding all beside under damp masses of foliage. Others again will bear the sunlight if they can just find a refuge for their roots in the damp hedge-bank, in the moist crevices of walls and ruins, or amidst the interlaced branches of trees. There are others still which hide where not even the"], [25, "SWEET DEVON. 11 tiniest ray of sunlight can pierce the dark retreat which they choose, and where they can revel in soft and humid warmth. But all Ferns, even the sunniest of the modest family, love moisture and shade the best, and though they will sometimes grow in the full sunlight, become developed into their most mature forms in cool and shady situations. It is, then, the beautiful and unrivalled forms of Fern-life which fling over Devonshire scenery its almost undescribable charm. Peer at low tide into yon dark and dripping cavern which yawns upon the sea ! The bright sunshine that dances upon the rippling waves, pauses at the cavern's mouth, as if not daring to penetrate its gloomy depths. But just one tiny gleam of light has ventured to cross the threshold, and sparkling on the dripping water, it flashes through the opaque darkness a kind of electric light. As the water falls, drip ! drip ! into the pool below, the light increases, and then \u2014 oh glorious sight ! \u2014 you see at the side and on the roof of this lonesome sea-cave the beautiful Sea Spleenwort (Asplenium marinum), hiding its roots in the cavern walls, and spreading out its bright green and shining fronds, that they may luxuriate in the dark humidity of its chosen retreat. Or peer over yonder cliff, whose inaccessible sides overhang the seething waves ! Look closely into the shady cleft which nestles under yon projecting spur ! There you may see, far out of your reach, one of the most rare and exquisite of the British Ferns \u2014 the True Maiden-hair (Adiantum Capillus-veneris). Could you venture near enough to grasp it in your hand, you would indeed recognise that it is one of the most exquisite of plants. Its fine black wiry frond-steins like a dark maiden's hair \u2014 it is most appropriately named \u2014 rise in clusters from its crown, the main frond-stems being branched with smaller and more"], [26, "SWEET DEVON. 12 beautiful hair-like stems, which bear upon their tender points the delicate, light-green, fan-shaped leaflets. Wandering through the cool lanes of Devonshire you may, too, meet with the fragrant Hay-scented Buckler Fern (Lastrea recurva), which emits so beautiful an odour when pressed in the hand ; with the delicately and transparently leaved Ma'rsh Buckler Fern (Lastrea thelypteris) ; with the Mountain BuckleT Fern (Lastrea montana), whose silvery fronds make the air fragrant when you tread upon them in their incipient unrolled state. But these varieties are not to be commonly encountered in every Devonshire lane. And still rarer \u2014 though found in Devonshire \u2014 are the Lanceolate Spleenwort (Asplenium lanceolatum), the tiny Forked Spleenwort (Asplenium septentrionale), the Tunbridge Filmy Fern (Hymenophyllum tunbridgense), and Wilson's Filmy Fern (Hymenophyllum unilaterale). The Moonwort (Botrychium lunaria), and the common Adder's Tongue (Oj)hioglossum vulgatum) are also Ferns of Devonshire growth. We do but enumerate these, and pass on to speak of some of the Ferns which may be seen in almost every Devonshire lane, and which, although common in the sense of being plentiful, are nevertheless among the most beautiful of the British Ferns.\""], [27, "DEVON VALES. 13 Efte Combe J&outft.

Each is like the other, and each is like no other English scenery. Each has its upright walls, inland of rich oakwood, nearer the sea of dark green furze, then of smooth turf, then of weird black cliffs which range out right and left far into the deep sea, in castles, spires, and wings of jagged iron-stone. Each has its narrow strip of fertile meadow, its crystal trout steam winding across and across from one hill-foot to the other ; its grey stone mill, with the water sparkling and humming round the dripping well ; its dark rock pools above the tide-mark, where the salmon-trout gather in from their Atlantic wanderings, after each autumn flood ; its ridges of blown sand, bright with golden trefoil and crimson lady's fingers, its grey bank of polished pebbles, down which the stream rattles towards the sea below.

' The lanes,' as the Hand-Book prettily describes them, ' are steep and narrow, and bordered by tangled hedges, often thirty feet above the road, sheltering even the hills from the rigour of unfriendly blasts. In the deep shadowy combes the villages lie nestled with roseate walls of clay and roof of thatch, and seldom far from one of those crystal streams which enliven every valley of this rocky county.' If the mind of the traveller be in unison with such quiet prospects, he may enjoy them here in endless succession. But he must not be impatient of the leafy screen which generally confines his eye to the close home view. Without it the scene would lose its peculiar charm ; while, were.it absent, the general conformation of the country is such, that the observer would seldom gain an extensive view to counterbalance the loss. He must be content with the occasional peep at some unexpected turn of the moorland tor, or the stripe of blue sea which bound the valley in opposite directions. It is a spot for repose and meditative enjoyment, and 'dreams that wave before the half shut eye:' not for eager admiration and novelty-hunting. According to the deep analogy which subsists between outward nature and human life, it may be said that while one might prefer to live amidst scenery of bolder features and freer character, and suggestive of a wider range of thought, it is to such a nook as this that one would fain retire to die,\""], [31, "DEVON LANES. 17 fHarriage is Htkt a \u00a9cbonsfjire 3Lane.

A pair of crooks thus com- pleted, is slung over the packsaddle on the beast of burden, one swinging on each side to make the balance true. They are used for carrying faggots furze, or logs of wood.

But, thinks I too, these banks, within which we are pent, With bud, blossom, and berry are richly besprent ; And the conjugal fence, which forbids us to roam, Looks lovely when decked with the comforts of home. In the rock's gloomy crevice the bright holly grows, The ivy waves fresh o'er the withering rose ; And the evergreen love of a virtuous wife Soothes the roughness of care, cheers the winter of life. Then long be the journey, and narrow the way, I'll rejoice that I've seldom a turnpike to pay ; And, whate'er others say, be the last to complain, Though marriage is just like a Devonshire lane. \u00a9ebon Hanes anb tfjeir Associations. Rev. M. G. Watkins, M.A. From vol. ix. of the Cornhill Magazine. The great Italian poet, at the commencement of his song, finds himself lost in a wood, dark, rugged, and solitary. We shall begin by placing our readers in a labyrinth, bright, smiling, and picturesque. Nothing is easier than to find this maze in the outskirts of most Devonshire villages. The West is proverbially the land of green lanes, and though you must not go too far west, or the stone walls of the Cornish hills will disenchant you, no one can find it hard to lose himself in the network of lanes that surround any village in Devon. Let us transport our reader then to the lanes that skirt the myrtles and fuchsias of Budleigh Salterton."], [33, "DEVON LANES. 19 Much like the \" hollow lanes \" of Hampshire, about which Gilbert White discourses so lovingly, they far surpass them in prodigality of floral wealth and abrupt change of scenery. Curious legends and old-world characters are to be found in them ; railroads have, for the most part, avoided them, and there are no more pleasant associations than those which crowd upon the mind in threading these lanes at any season of the year. Labyrinthine, indeed, are the lanes of South Devon to the stranger who wanders in them, hopelessly enclosed by lofty banks crowned with tall hedges, that twist in and out, and are interlaced by others, and circle round again under the blue spring sky, like the fabled stream that never blent its waters with the ocean. Passing beautiful, too, are they, filled with a changeful loveliness of bright-coloured flowers and pendent ferns and darting dragon-flies ; while creeping bind-weeds knot themselves round gnarled oak -steins, with leaves more artistically cut than those of the acanthus, and berries, green, black and red, like the wampum on an Indian warrior. Here the hedges almost meet overhead, and grace ful festoons of flowers depend like lianas in a tropical forest, as you will see them nowhere else in England. There the bank on one side falls gently, and what a prospect opens on the view! Fair meadows bathed in sunshine, with the Otter river winding through them, lie below ; yonder are the red Devon steers grazing up to their dewlaps in buttercups ; beyond them dusky moors melt into purple haze, and every here and there you catch a glimpse of the far-off Tors on Dartmoor simmering in the mid-day glare. Then again, the other side of our lane sinks abruptly, and the sea spreads out far below, with a white sail specking it here and there to take away from its oppressive infinity. C2"], [34, "DEVON LANES. 20 And birds sing and bees hum amongst the bright yellow furze-flowers, and a stream that like yourself has lost its way tinkles merrily adown the bank from the coppice. The lazy hawk hovering on your right does not even deem it needful to wheel off in alarm. So irresistible is Devon in her beauty that you fall in love at first sight, and may be quite sure that like every loveable maiden, the more you see of her the more will her unobtrusive gentleness endear her to you. A glance at the physical features of the country shows how these picturesque lanes were formed. The aboriginal trackway over hill and dale rudely marked out by stones laid at intervals, just as the Devon coastguardsmen still guide themselves over the cliffs at night by lines of stones so deposited, sank gradually into the soil. Mud from the path was flung on either side. Violent rains cut deep furrows in the load ; during winter the path became a water-course where it was not a bog, and this continued for centuries. Then came an age of improvement, the adjoining moor was divided from the road, after the native fashion, by banks of earth ; trees and bushes took possession of them ; and while every season washes the road away, every time the farmer mends his fence, the banks above gain height. Thus each year deepens the lane. Frost often brings down one of these banks, which are topped by hedges, in some cases thirty feet above the traveller's head ; and this \" rougement,\" as they call it in Devon, must be replaced before the lane is passable, so that their depth seldom diminishes, and perpetually increases. Many of these lanes are extremely ancient. Round Dartmoor especially, they go back to Celtic times, or beyond them to that dim, pre-historic antiquity where even"], [35, "DEVON LANES. 21 archaeology loses itself. Their natural formation, as we have described it above, overthrows a theory which has before now found favour with ethnologists, and which would contrast the generous, open-hearted Roman with the skulking Celt. The Roman shows his character, according to this fancy, by his wide, elevated streets, driven for the most part in a straight line through the length and breadth of the land ; while the other's nature was to hide in cir cuitous, hollow lanes, fighting in trenches as it were, while the legions man\u0153uvred in the open. What little the ancients have told us of the Celts negatives this view. Though superior force and a higher civilization drove the ancient Briton to the fastnesses of Wales and Cornwall, the Celt was brave to rashness. Returning to the lanes, another feature which strikes the stranger \u2014 besides their twistings up and down the hill sides, and their depth \u2014 is their narrowness. It is very difficult and in many cases impossible for one vehicle to pass another in them. Sometimes a gate has to be opened and one or other must drive into the field; sometimes by waiting in a more open space it is just possible for the coming vehicle to graze by. When the great man of the country drives in them he has outriders to clear the way for him. This narrow roadway gives the history of loco motion in Devon. Originally these lanes would only be traversed by foot passengers and beasts of burden, the predecessors of the pack-horses, laden with \" crooks \" of faggots or furze, so often met with at the present day. Then came the broadest view on the subject of transport our forefathers could hold. The curious narrow wain without wheels, consisting of a rough body drawn on two thick shafts which rest on the ground behind, came into"], [36, "22 DE VON LANES. vogue. Specimens of it may still be seen in use on the hill farms. Amongst the minor embarrassments of these old lanes is meeting an infuriated ox running amuck. If you are not prepared to scale the steep banks at a moment's notice, you should be ready-witted enough to provide yourself with a straw. It is a west-country superstition that even if you meet his Satanic Majesty you can cut him in half with a straw. We hesitate about giving another receipt, as we never came to such close quarters as to give us the oppor tunity of trying its efficacy. It is of little use to ladies, who are most likely to be caught in the plight we have fancied, still here it is. You have only to spit over his horns, whether it be ox or devil, and he will instantly disappear. There is another bit of Devon folk-lore we may as well mention, for a traveller in these intricate lanes will often have the chance of putting it in practice. If you lose your way, take off your coat, and having turned it inside out, put it on again. You will immediately find the right track. It may easily be conjectured that the proverb, \" It is a long lane which has no turning,\" could never have been coined in Devonshire, although that other equally true one of marriage being like a lane, from which when once you are in there is no getting out, is manifestly indigenous. Autumn brings a beauty of its own to these quiet lanes. Heather and golden gorse stray from the moorland down their banks \u2014 the last bright flowers of the year \u2014 just as two or three purple and pink cloud-flakes often linger in the west long after a glorious sunset. The tall hedges are a tangle of convolvulus and honeysuckle, filling the calm evening hours with fragrance. Mid-day, which, sooth to say, is during July somewhat oppressive in these still"], [37, "23 DEVON LANES. retreats, has now its own clear, sharp breeze. Deeper shades of red and yellow are passing over the leaves. You may often meet here two or three bare-armed children from the cottage on the hill-side, staring at you with round blue eyes as they gather blackberries, which have left numerous specimens of nature-printing on their cheeks. The biggest boy maybe stands on a donkey's back under the nut trees, clutching at their treasures, with no fear of the patient animal beneath him moving on. Mother is far away on the moors gathering \" worts \" (whortleberries), to sell to visitors at the neighbouring sea-side village. Home life is very uneventful to these cottagers. The children tell you, \" Vather be to the zyder-press,\" and this answer will apply equally well to him, good honest man, any day from August to November. The stranger rambling in these Devon lanes is frequently surprised at a turn of the road to find before him, in its sheltered \" Combe,\" an old mansion now converted into a farm-house. Very picturesque does the transformation render it, with its thatched gables, deeply sunk dormer windows, and large lower casements, lighting what was the common hall, but is now the goodwife's kitchen. Merry beards once wagged there, and the best families of Devon \u2014 the Mohuns, Carews, Champernounes \u2014 may have flourished within the massive walls whose heavy mullioned windows you see blinking in the sunshine. Gilbert and Drake may have circumnavigated the world there to an admiring audience O'ler oceans of cider. All these worthies have long since passed away, but Nature is still unchangeable.

Just such a house may be seen in a lane near Budleigh Salterton. Sir Walter Raleigh was born in it. Its pro jecting porch and heavily-thatched gables have an old world look about them ; but on the whole it takes its fame as a matter of course, and makes no great pretensions to be anything more than an Elizabethan country house. The hills rise above it at the back, stacks close in around it, you hear the cows lowing from the \" linneys,\" the garden is full of old-fashioned flowers, and a genial atmosphere of peace hangs over it. The general features of the place must have changed very little since Sir Walter rambled about the quiet woodland ways which hem it in. Here he cherished boundless dreams of El Dorado galleons and ingots. Hayes Wood in front and the hills behind must often have seen him, like another Alexander, chafing at the narrow horizon of his world. The first pipe smoked in England may have been puffed on the mossy bank where you sit at present. It is impossible to refrain from associating this calm spot with the courtier's after-life. How often must he have turned in fancy to this little homestead when fainting under a tropical sun, or chafing as a prisoner in the Tower ! The mind, they say, often revisits early scenes in the moment of death. Raleigh may have seemed to hear the sheep bleat, and called up in fancy the well-remembered outline of Hayes Farm against yonder green hill-side as he closed his eyes and laid his head on the block. Expeditions to such famous spots should be undertaken if possible during summer. Candour compels us to state that no one would care to walk lightly shod in winter through the Devon lanes. The road which in more"], [39, "DEVON LANES. 25 civilized counties November converts into \"feather-bed lane,\" becomes here in the native term \" mucksy-lane.\" You long, as you flounder in the mire, for the ten-foot stride of the giant Ordulph, who lies buried at Tavistock. As the hedges lose their bravery, the red sandstone stares in all its nakedness from the banks. No storm or wet daunts the pretty blue periwinkle from flowering here during the winter months, and there is sure to be a plentiful supply of wormwood at every corner, \" good to prevent weariness in travellers,\" according to Pliny's old-world wisdom. As the long evenings close in, you may hear \"eldritch skirls\" in the coppices around. That silent spectre passing overhead so silently as hardly to disturb the streams of moonlight is only the owl on his way, as in Shakespeare's days, \" to woo the baker's daughter.\" You need not mistake it for some thing uncanny. The last of the Devonshire witches \u2014 Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susannah Ed wards \u2014 were executed at Exeter Castle in 1082, though many a poor old woman in out-of-the-way districts is still suspected of being \" a white witch.\" It is still thought dangerous, though, to disturb \"the little people \" at their revels on the sward by the lane-side which falls back to the oak wood. You will do this if you whistle as you pass by. Let them be in peace, unless you wish to be \" pixy-led,\" and left \" stogged \" in a deep swamp. It is ticklish work meddling with Elbricht and his fairy folk. Be forbearing, even you, my irate British farmer, if they will gallop your horses over the moor at night, and Dobbin, your faithful market steed, be discovered all over foam in his stall on one or two mornings during winter. Why should the pixies be debarred from a night with \"the wish hounds \" occasionally ? Open your window the next"], [40, "26 DEVON LANES. frosty midnight, and you will hear the rout sweeping merrily away towards Dartmoor. Do not even let your better half exasperate you by complaints of her dairy being rifled by them. It is true she has never ceased twitting you for that unlucky night's work, when you went down to the cellar, after she had retired to the upper regions, and un fortunately dropping the candle and the cork of the cider barrel, had to stand all night with your finger in the bung hole, to prevent the precious liquor running out. But bid her wink at fairy misdemeanours, and remind her she may then be invited to fairy-land herself, and come back won derfully enriched. Perhaps she may even stay there alto gether. Such cases are not unknown in the West. In 1696, it is upon record that a certain Ann Jeffries, in Cornwall, \" was fed for six months by a small sort of airy people called fairies,\" and performed many strange and wonderful cures on her return home with salves and medicines she received from them, for which she never took a penny from her patients. The Devon peasantry are very superstitious, and the long moonlit nights of Christmas, which are so fascinating to most people, bring their special terrors to the lone farm house, or the cottage half hidden by the pines at the side of these lanes. These fancies do not for the most part take the fatalistic hue of the Welsh countryman, or the still more gloomy complexion of the superstitions of the Channel Islander. The Devon yeoman has no fear of meeting a coffin obstructing his path when benighted in the narrow lanes, which is sure to betoken his own if he knocks it roughly over, or is otherwise than scrupulously polite in taking off the lid and replacing it the wrong way, when it instantly disappears. It is rather an undefined dread that"], [41, "DEVON LANES. 27 something might come, which oppresses him as he looks over the glimmering waste of snow. Something did assuredly come, some thirteen or fourteen years ago, to tbe very neighbourhood wherein we have fancied our traveller rambling, the angle formed about Salterton by the left bank of the Exe and the sea. In the outskirts of Topsham, to the lanes which ramify from there into the country, were noticed on several wintry mornings mysterious footsteps over the virgin snow, having great affinity (so the natives affirmed) to the cloven hoofs popularly assigned to a certain nameless personage. These tracks advanced steadily without any apparent divarication, walking over roofs, walls, and other obstacles that might reasonably be supposed capable of baffling a hoaxer. The story quickly spread to the London papers, and all kinds of guesses were made respecting the footprints. Some ascribed them to natural causes, such as the visit of a large wild fowl, &c, but found small favour with the country-side for their trouble. The mystery was never satisfactorily cleared up. Long after most people, however, had forgotten the whole occurrence, the neighbouring peasants did not dare to stir from their hearths after nightfall. Often as we our selves have threaded Devon lanes after sunset, we cannot testify to having seen anything more fearsome than bats or owls. But our lanes are full of beauty (as well as of mud) even in winter. Here a delicate snow-wreath glitters in the moonlight, waiting for sunrise to lend its pink and amber flushes, the death-tints of its graceful folds. There a deep recess in the bank glistens with icicle spears, as if deter mined that summer shall never more hang fondly over the ferny treasures within. The old trees sigh overhead, as"], [42, "DEVON LANES. 28 their last leaf flutters to the ground; and now a deeper plunge than usual into the quagmire recalls us to the sterner realities of life. We were fast nearing some enchanted land of fancy, and lo ! wre find ourselves ankle-deep in mud ! Pluck up courage and press on through the wintry lanes a little further. The faint chimes of St. Mary's at distant Ottery are flinging their Christmas greeting over many a mile of moorland. We are passing the old \" cob \" walls and grey-headed barns of a substantial farmstead. The cocks will crow here all the night before Christmas-day, according to the beautiful legend of the county, to bid \" Each fettered ghost slip to his several grave,\" and the very oxen at midnight will fall down on their knees before the manger. The next turn brings us to the Otter, rushing along some forty feet below with angry stream, very different from the pleasant murmur with which it glides through the land in summer. Notice how abrupt are the transitions of the lanes. We can now catch the distant roar wdiich tells of the sea chafing awfully amidst the rocks of the Salterton reef. How changed, too, are its waves from those which in August ripple gently over the many-coloured pebbles on the beach, much as some gigantic Viking might have dallied with the yellow curls of his princess. Now they form a black seething torrent, flashing here and there into huge foam-crested rollers, that chase each other wildly on, and leap, and strike, and roar again with rage as the sturdy rocks stand firm, and they can only swirl round and break against their next neighbours in the mighty charge. Fully to appreciate the Devon sea, it should be visited from one of the quiet lanes that open on to the beach, when a good southerly breeze brings it in, and all the green expanse"], [43, "DEVON LANES. is flecked with many a white \" sea-horse \" riding gallantly on, as though after some imaginary hero of Ivry. One more Christmas association, and then we will pass to a brighter scene. Curiously enough, the blue scented violet, which lends such a charm to the lanes of other counties, is very rare in Devon, and the mistletoe is never found there. Glastonbury seems its head-quarters in England, and whole truck-loads of it are imported every Christmas for the festivities in the West. Its absence in Devon and Cornwall calls up an awful picture of the womankind of other days, when such amatory trifles as violets and mistletoe were not encouraged in the land. In some such mood do the Latin poets look back with reverence on the austere virtues of the Sabine dames, who dismissed their husbands to work in the fields, while they ruled the house and spun quietly at home. Doubtless the Devon swains are duly grateful as they see the pearly berries littering the stations on the Great Western, that their lives have fallen on more oscillatory days. If the Devon lanes are fair in summer, fairer in autumn, and not without a certain loveliness in winter, in spring they are simply radiant with beauty. Let us breast yonder hill with April's sunshine fleeting in vast sheets of splendour over the heather. The lanes are rather intricate, and if a damp place here and there speaks of spring showers, you will often recover your equanimity by finding some rare plant, such as the pretty little pinguicola, Lusitanica. On these spangled banks all the wild flowers of the .West seem following the example of the hares, and running riot over mossy cushions and ivy-clad stumps. But we are out of the lanes now, and with just one look from the hill-side, plunge into the glades on the other side, and soon reach my favourite grange."], [44, "30 DEVON LANES.

Diving down here into the deep valley of a little stream ; climbing up there again to the summit of an intervening spur, anon, hurrying down once more, helter-skelter, lane and watercourse and gutter together, it tumbles headlong but crookedly into a second dale ; for all these old Devon shire roads run transversely to the natural watersheds, and no sooner have they mounted the steep on one side of a dividing ridge, than they are off again in a semi-circle down the sheer slope of the other. Cart-horses toil wearily up the first half of the way with straining muscles, and plunge wildly down the second half, with drag red-hot and load jolting behind them, like mad creatures ; and when you hear them coming round a jutting corner you stand hastily flat tened against the right hand bank, reducing your sectional diameter to the smallest possible dimensions, with two inches to spare between your toes and the nearside rut. For brightness of hue there is nothing like it. The red soil glows with ochre between the ferns ; the green hartstongues defy all the resources of one's colour-box ; the clear blue sky puts to shame the muddy ultramarine on one's palette. Further on, when a distant glimpse here and there lets us catch a passing vista of the sea, it shows a scarred cliff of umber and sienna, with a sheet of purple water gleaming against the white pebbles of the beach beyond. There are critics who talk about the brilliant colours of the tropics and the Mediterranean ; but if any spot on earth can beat the mingled green grass, and red broken rocks, and purple sea, and deep- fleeced sheep of Watcombe, then that spot has still to be seen by the present spectator,"], [46, "32 DEVON LANES. It is not all still life either. From the hedge, as we move, a self-assertive cuckoo reiterates from minute to minute the obtrusive announcement of his own name, with a persistence which in spite of its monotony never succeeds in wearying the ear. Over the gaps which lead into the turnip-fields we can see the white tails of numberless young rabbits twink ling rapidly and unanimously towards the safety of the hedge-bank. Horse-flies do not forget to pay us their grace ful attentions, especially on the delicate and juicy region about the nape of the neck, while midges dance about us by thousands, and occasionally insist upon immolating them selves in a watery grave by recklessly flying down our mouths whenever we open them to speak. For winged things of all kinds, indeed, the true Devonshire lane is a heaven-sent refuge. There are four separate torrents tumbling down it in four parallel courses, one on each side by way of gutter, and one in each of the ruts worn down by the cart-wheels near the middle. In and about the pools into which they broaden now and again innumerable insects live and breathe. Then there is the shade to attract them, and the coolness and the moisture and the freedom from wind, all of which things your midge or your May-fly dearly loves. Furthermore, there are horses and cows to torment, let alone stray carters, tourists, and sketchers \u2014 no feeding ground on earth can equal an amateur's neck for sweetness ; while the very droppings on the road afford a rich feast to less epicurean flies. In and out among them the big dragon flies dart on evenly-poised wings ; horse-stingers we call them commonly in these parts, though they are really guilt less of the horse's blood ; but they prey on the smaller insects around them with all the swiftness and ferocity of tigers. Flowers, on the other hand, are few, and of common"], [47, "DEVON LANES. 33 sorts ; a great purple foxglove or two, a bunch of tattered ragged robins, and a mass of yellow woodspurge now and again \u2014 these make up the chief bright colouring of the nearer foreground. The damp and the shade sort better with the retiring taste of ferns ; and for ferns of every kind the lane is a perfect picture. Set in their hollowed frame of russet sandstone, they stand out against their surroundings with a vivid greenness which beggars the resources of human pigments. Why the lanes should run so deep below the general surface \u2014 this one is cut down about seven or eight feet beneath the level of the fields on either side \u2014 has often puzzled many a casual visitor ; but in truth they were not made, they have been simply worn so. It is the ceaseless usage of ages that has cut them down to their existing depth, and the ruts of the wheels are cutting them still deeper at the present day. The wear and tear they have undergone is the best proof of their immemorial antiquity. For the lanes are far older than the high-roads, which often have to dip down in order to cross them ; and just here one can see how the ancient line avoids the new-fangled town that dates only from the days of the Plantagenets, but keeps right on from point to point of the earlier villagers, with names lost in the philological mist of Keltic times. The Roman ridge ways on the chalk still stand high above the downs, instead of falling flush to the level ; and so, on the chalk there are no lanes, because the water sinks in instead of running off along the surface and cutting itself a pathway. For the same reason,v chalk has no glens or water-courses, only long swelling ridges, and basin-shaped hollows ; it weathers evenly and smoothly in every part. But here on the sand stone the rain soon carves out deep cleaves (as we call them) l>"], [48, "34 DEVON LANES. for the little brooks ; and so the sandstone is a country of Devonshire valleys and Devonshire lanes. As soon as human feet or cart-wheels (it was chariot-wheels, doubtless, when they first began) have made a little runnel for the water to flow in, it continues to scoop out a channel for itself, till at last it cuts down the lane to a depth of several feet below the surface. Horses, too, help the work forward by loosening the middle soil, and the rain then washes away the softer sandy parts, leaving only the central ridge of worn pebbles in their midst. Often enough one can prove that the lane is older than the Roman road itself, because the Roman road dips or diverges to meet it ; and in other cases the lane religiously avoids a mound or earthwork which the Roman road ruthlessly cuts through. It must be thousands of years since some of these rude trackways first began to be ; and in their meaningless meanderings one can easily read the fact that they grew up from mere accidental use, like modern footpaths, instead of being definitely laid out and engineered, like modern roads. It is one of the great charms of our Devonshire lanes that they twist thus irresponsibly from angle to angle ; for everyone of their elbows brings us face to face with a fresh view, and every one of their topmost turning-points brings us down with two brace of petty torrents at our side into the valley of a fresh streamlet, brawling and bustling over its pebbly little ford below. -\u00bb-^|^)\"\u00a34-"], [49, "DEVON HEDGES. 35 \u00a9cbansljivc $}cbges anb ILanes. Richard John King in the Standard, 14 April, 1876. Among the changes which the progress of modern agriculture is bringing into the West must be reckoned the gradual clearing away of the broad, steep hedges -which form one of the most distinctive characteristics of Devonshire scenery. The gradual clearing ; for the work is happily of such a nature that only very distant descen dants of the present generation will see the completion of it should it ever be carried so far. These Devonshire hedges are literally earthworks : many of them quite as massive and as formidable as the mounds and intrench ments that surround an ancient hill fort. Some of them, too, may perhaps be of almost equal age. Hallam suggests that some English hedges may be among the most vener able relics in this country \u2014 that is, of course, within, and far within, the historical era. But no hedges and no fence.1-, of any kind can possibly claim a greater antiquity, or have more in common with works of which the antiquity is certain, than these Devonshire earth mounds, which time has half mouldered, half clothed, into so great beauty. It is quite possible that when the first Saxon settlers (in this case they were really Saxons, and cannot properly be called English) appeared in the far west, they found a condition of the country very different from that which they encountered on the east and in the midland of Britain. Of course here, as there, were wide open heaths and great stretches of unenclosed land. But may not the Danmonians have already fenced and warded D\""], [50, "36 DEVON HEDGES. whole tracts of their district ? May not this be the reason why we find so little trace in Devonshire of the open field system which usually marks the Teutonic settlement in Germany as in England ? And may not some, at least, of the Devonshire hedges be as old as the days of Gereint, or the historic Arthur ? If this is possibly the case with the fence itself, far more are we entitled to claim such an antiquity for the deeply sunk, winding lanes, the steep banks of which are so often crested with these earthworks. These are the lanes which, we are assured on good poetical authority, have so much in common with the \" conjugal fence \": \u2014 \" The banks are so high to the left hand and right, That they shut up the beauties around them from sight, And hence you'll allow 'tis an inference plain That marriage is just like a Devonshire lane.\" There is no \" path \" or \" road \" quite like a true Devon shire lane to be found elsewhere in England ; nothing so long and often so irritating in its unbroken length ; and nothing certainly half so beautiful. Many of them were at first, perhaps, mere cattle tracks, worn gradually into the yielding soil, and widened as communication became more necessary between different parts of the county. But the width of the older roads barely suffices for two horsemen to ride abreast. Sir Walter Raleigh, in one of his reports, declares that ordnance could not be conveyed from Exeter to Plymouth by land, because thc road \u2014 and the road which he meant was the old line of the Foss way \u2014 was too narrow and too bad to allow of the dragging of the guns by horses ; and, indeed, along the coast the sea was the natural highway. Inland, the lanes were in winter picturesque water-courses."], [51, "37 DEVON HEDGES. Fuller, who during the troubles of the civil war, was for some time in Devonshire, and printed his \" Good Thoughts in Bad Times \" at Exeter, shows us plainly enough that he found the Devonshire lanes an entire novelty, and that, if he recognised certain of their merits in summer, he was keenly alive to the discomforts of journeying through them in wet and wintry weather. He appreciated the wild strawberries that sometimes give a scarlet touch to the bank side. \" Most toothsome to the palate,\" he writes, \" (I mean if with claret wine or sweet cream) ; and so plentiful in this County that a traveller may gather them, sitting on horseback, in their hollow highways.\" This is a picture surely drawn from pleasant experience ; and when he describes the invention or rather the introduction of \" gambadoes \" by one of the Carews of Antony, he suggests not less clearly winter troubles encountered by himself in muddy lanes and under dripping branches. \" They be much worn in the west ; whereby, whilst one rides on horseback, his legs ai-e in a coach, clean and warm, in those dirty countries.\" And yet, even in winter, who with any feeling for colour, or intricacy of outline, has ever struggled onward between the steep banks of such a \" hollow highway \" without lingering at times in admiration of the beauty that surrounds him ? There comes now and then a clear, bright day, when the sky is all blue, and the crisp, white frost, except in deeply shadowed places, has quite disappeared before noon. The trees and coppice wood that overhang the road are for the most part leafless ; but here a group of oaken boughs retain their withered foliage, rich in all tones of brown and purple ; and there a spiring holly, a mass of deep green bossed with scarlet, glitters in the sun"], [52, "38 DEVON HEDGES. with its myriad reflections of light, and the mosses that lie in great broad patches along the steep weather-broken banks, put on their brightest and freshest vesture on such a day. Many of them belong altogether to winter, and their quaint forms, like those of diminutive trees and ferns can only then be seen in perfection. Ivy wreaths trail over the soft, sunny beds, and add a charm to them by the contrast of tone. The lady ferns are yet green ; only the bracken has changed ; and though the richer colouring has passed away, it is still where the light falls through it, the \" red fern \" of the old ballad makers. And for the moving life of the place, a company of blue-winged jays, keeping together through the winter, as the spring brood generally does, may flit across from side to side, or a magpie (let us hope it will be a pair) may hop before us in the sun. Even Reynard himself may show his bright fur for a moment. In truth, if a long Devonshire lane at all resembles a prison, it is one to which the most ardent lover of space and freedom might readily doom himself for a time : \" Bees that soar for bloom High as the highest peak of Furness Fells, Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells.\" Many an artist and many a wanderer must have felt from time to time \"the weight of too much liberty.\" Mr. Ruskin somewhere tells us that a foot or two of an ordinary hedge will contain matter with which a true and reverent student of Nature might busy himself for months. And a Devonshire hedge is by no means ordinary, even, as we see, in mid-winter. It may very well be a question whether the strong local"], [53, "DEVON HEDGES. 39 feeling of Devonshire \u2014 the strong affection with which Devonians regard their native hills and homesteads, to whatever distance they may have been withdrawn from them in actual life \u2014 may not, at least, have been intensified, by the enclosing and protecting influences of high hedges and steep banks, narrowing the life of the hill farm and of the solitary hamlet, at the same time that they give it shelter \u2014 \" The child who plays Beneath the ash trees, by the river side, Sees the same quiet home his fathers knew ; \" and all that surrounds that home becomes the more deeply impressed, the more narrowed in range and extent it is. The little furze-grown enclosures, and the pasture fields about a true moorland farm produce in Devonshire much the same feeling of long lingering attachment, as a very similar country, and households isolated in much the same manner, have tended to bring about in the Scottish Lowlands, and many a picture drawn from Eskdale or \" the Mearns \" by our dear old friend Christopher North would answer almost equally well for the home-life of a farm nitched into the side of a half reclaimed hill rising towards Dartmoor or Exmoor. The long lane which winds upwards towards such a farm may be a true hollow way, with its own special beauty. Probably it will have an unusual share of such beauty, since its course will most likely be through deep copses, covering the lower ground with an intricate tangle of grey stems and leafy branches. But the hedges, if they are to be so called, which surround the farm itself will be of a very different character. They are often of great age, as old as the settlement itself, the \" cote,\" or the \" worthy,\" whose primitive name tells us at once that it was founded in the"], [54, "40 DEVON HEDGES. earlier days of Saxondom. Great blocks of native stone have been allowed to remain untouched, whilst the granite wall or hedge has been piled on or around them. Such a fence might seem unpromising enough, as far as beauty is concerned, -whatever shelter it might afford to the young lambs or the growing corn. But century after century has not passed away without clothing and softening the rugged stones ; and an ancient fence of this sort is hardly less full of charm or less rich in contrast than a hedgerow of the lower land. Lichens, grey, yellow, red, cover the granite blocks, and soft green mosses glow in the hollows between them. Wild thyme, hawkweed, hartstongues, find their own nooks and spread themselves as they may. Stone crops, white and yellow, star the crevices; and often along the hillocks of green turf that close up towards the foot of the wall, or on the broad crest of the fence itself, the foxglove dresses its purple ranks, giving its own decided colouring to the whole scene. Such a fence has plenty of lessons for those who can read them ; and if it be not, in its general character, so peculiar to the west as the steep bank or the broad earthwork, it is nowhere else so beautiful, and its native roughness is nowhere else so gracefully veiled. We have wandered away from the true Devonshire hedges with which we set out, and must return to the less rugged country and to the fields and fences about the low land farms. An old Devonshire hedge, a venerable earth work, which has mingled in the lives of generation after generation from tho days of Wolfhard or the Godwyne who first raised it, is often one of the best guardians of the natural antiquities of the country. Plants and insects which have disappeared elsewhere make such a hedge their fastness, and hardly leave it until the whole mass of earth"], [55, "DEVON HEDGES. is displaced, and field added to field after the modern \u2014 but not the picturesque or homely \u2014 system. The proper and simple hedgerow of the midland counties is frequently of great beauty. In spring-time its masses of blossoming whitethorn mark out the great fields in lines of snow ; and in autumn the wealth of scarlet berries is hardly less striking. But these can in no way compare with the broad west-country rampart, wdiose very breadth and massiveness tell of days when there was land enough and to spare, and the unproductive covering of such a surface was of little moment. All wild flowers find their home here ; and often the flat top of the hedge, for a season after the brushwood has been cut, becomes a sheet of colour, thick set with pink \" Robins \" (the campion that in local folk-lore seems to be called after Robin Goodfellow, and is certainly not uncon nected with the wood-elves), alive with flocks of the wild blue hyacinth, or with daffodils that \"take the winds of March wdth beauty.\" And nestled here, under some oaken sapling or some mountain ash whose white clusters fill the air with faint sweetness, what a perfect foreground the hedge itself, with its flowers and its sprays of leafage, affords for the distant landscape. The grey moorland far away \u2014 the nearer woods \u2014 the farms with their meadows and pastures, intersected by a network of fences like our own \u2014 \"Hardly hedge rows \u2014 little lines Of sportive wood run wild,\" gain fresh value from the contrast, and each part of the scene is tied to thc others without a discord. Devonshire hedges, it is often complained, shut out the grand views of the distant country, and you may travel between them for"], [56, "DEVON HEDGES. 42 miles without a glimpse of what lies beyond. This may now and then be the case. But let him who, in spite of the beauty of his prison walls, grumbles at such confinement, scale the wall itself, and make that his \"coign of vantage.\" He will admit that the broken, wooded landscape would lose half its charm if the high, leafy hedges were swept away from it. But in truth it is a great mistake to quarrel with the deep \" hollow ways,\" or the broad earthwork fences, even on the score of the distant landscape. They form, in most cases, the becoming avenue or the long vestibule leading to the point of high ground where the widest and grandest view is to be obtained ; and we all know how great is the advantage of such a sudden revelation. The long, green ferny hollow has delighted us in its own fashion. All at once we gain the hill top ; the hedges fall away on either side as the road descends at our feet, and half a county stretches in front, with all its deep coombes, its tumbled hills, and its river valleys, rising towards the peaks and the ridges of Dartmoor, all, it may be, glowing in the sunset, or changing with the gleams and cloud shadows of a soft spring morning. Few modern roadways prepare for us a surprise like this. It belongs to the old system, like thc hedges and the lands themselves. Those who formed and beat out the old tracks took small account of steep hills, and knew well enough the advantage of such shelter as the high banks afforded them. They had to keep clear of low marshy grounds and of thickly-tangled woods ; and in looking for some such height as has just been suggested, it is curious to note the manner in which the most ancient roads are made to follow the first ridge above the valley, often winding along them for miles rather than descend for"], [57, "DEVON HEDGES. 43 a more direct way. We are changing all this ; but all who care for venerable associations and for the quiet beauty which gathers about old-world homesteads and their bye ways will look forward with little satisfaction to a time, however remote, when Devonshire hedges and Devonshire lanes shall have become altogether things of the past. \u00a9cbonsljire ?l?rtinrs in jjcbntary From the Queen, 1872. The \" flowery band that binds us to the earth \" is usually such a slender one in February, that it is hardly worth while to kneel upon damp banks and prowl under dripping hedgerows in search of the blooms that are probably not there. But this is an exceptional season. Wild vegetation is at least a month in advance at the date at which I am writing. While garden ground lies fallow, because gar deners object to working on land that is like a bog, the ground that is independent of garden is studded with flowers that belong properly to March and April. I have made three or four trial trips in search of wild flowers lately with the following results : It is true that the atmosphere of the West of England is peculiarly favourable to the early development of flowers, as well as to the perfect develop ment of ferns. But the lover of wild flowers, whose fate it is to pass the spring in London, will find that the lovely lanes about Willesden are not deficient in rare floral attractions. About three miles from Torquay there is a narrow road"], [58, "44 DEVON HEDGES. that much resembles a ravine, especially now, when the pathway is a shallow stream that comes \"cortling in its joy\" down from the table-land. Instead of sheer glistening rocks rising on either side, however, there are almost perpendicu lar banks, green and glossy as walls of emerald could be, whereon hartstongues with fronds two feet long, fat thick ivy leaves, the hard fern, the polypody, and the waving lady fern are tangled together in a glorious profusion. Of course the ferns are quite in the order of things. We were not in the least surprised to see them there ; we merely, half un consciously, patronisingly applauded them for being so fine. But presently the road grew less like a rivulet running down a ravine. The hedges sloped away instead of rising perpendicularly, and, as I bent down to gather the first wild narcissus I had seen for the year, a flash of bright blue caught my eyes, and I recognised the dear little scollop edged leaves and the trailing bloom of that familiar old hedgerow friend, the ground ivy. I was so glad to see it in February that I acted in a weak but human way : I tore it up and pressed it into the pocket of my saddle, as I had gone out without a specimen tin. In imagination I already saw it well dried and carefully pressed. But its actual fate was to be presently crushed under a gigantic head of the sweet-scented coltsfoot, whose superior charms rendered me indifferent to the integiity of the ground ivy. A little further on, at the junction of two cross lanes, I came to a drear looking old wall surrounding a deserted farm house. In its abandonment to clamp and dry rot, and all the other ills that beset a deserted house, it would have been a desolate object enough had it not been for the luxuriant ivy that trailed about its eaves, the delicate little white-flowered whitlow grass that covered the top of the"], [59, "DEVON HEDGES. 45 wall, and the long fronds of hartstongue that waved like pennons from the mouth of the ruined well. There was a tough ascent from the farmhouse. Once more the lane was like a ravine cut in the side of a mountain ; once more the water rippled down among big loose stones, whose presence there proved how little this bridle path was used. Brambles trailed out from either side, well into the middle of the pathway, in an unkempt, uncivilised way, that was pretty enough to look at, but not pleasant to ride through; but I struggled on, and at a corner had my reward in coming upon a tall group of , wild snow drops. We prize them in our gardens very properly, but I think we never value them to the same degree as when, in some country wild, their little graceful white heads bending down with a sweet stateliness arrest our attention. I was desperately divided in my desires about this little un expected clump upon which I had come. It seemed to me that I should be equally wrong to leave them or to take them ; they were so perfectly placed there on the top of a bank, waving well in sight of everyone who might pass, that it would be cruel to displace them ; but, on the other hand, probably no one would pass down that secluded lane while they were in bloom, and I have only pity, and no sympathy, for the flowers that blush unseen. But the snowdrops may be blooming in their solitude still, for the saving thought that if I brought them home they would have no more beauty than the other snowdrops in my garden, struck me just in time to save me from uprooting them. So I went on, giving them more than one wistful backward glance, but satisfied after all that I had spared them. These Devonshire lanes are inexhaustible, try them at what season of the year you like. Just as the first flush of"], [60, "DEVON HEDGES. 46 my regret for the snowdrops was parting, I came upon a yard or two of bank that was free from ferns, and was blue with that most exquisite of all our English blue wild flowers \u2014 the periwinkle. There is nothing in the hedges in any month that can exceed this purplish blue flower in richness and intensity, and at the same time in purity of hue. Nothing, except the tiny growing pimpernel, which is neither scarlet nor crimson, but something fairer and rarer than either colour \u2014 something that makes it a minute empress among wild flowers. What a bouquet I might have had by this time if I had only gathered everything I had seen ! It was too late to begin now, for the day was dying; but by the faint light that still came from the west I saw several half -open primroses, and upon a great loose heap of stones I recognised a large patch of mistletoe flowers, in their livery of uuconspicuous green. Pendant from the hedges every here and there the great tassels of the hazel waved in my face, showering out the powdery fluff with which they are covered. These can be arranged beautifully for room decoration in a tall vase, together with long trails of the glossy ivy. The \" black buds of March \" are showing on the ash trees, and the broad leaves of the wild garlic, which ought to have waited patiently till April, are already plentiful in some woods I know of, and will soon be crowded with flowers as pure and beautiful in appearance as the lily of the valley, but their perfume is intolerable. \u2014 A.T.C."], [61, "DARTMOOR. 47 Dartmoor Srcnrru. From Thc Forest of Dartmoor and its Borders, by Richard John King. The Forest of Dartmoor, together with the adjoining wrastes, contains about 130,000 acres, and its average level ranges from 1,200 to 1,400 feet above the sea. But many of the Tors are of much greater elevation ; in the northern quarter, especially, they rise to about 2,000 feet ; and the southern districts of England can shew few mountain views more varied, or more beautiful, than those which may be obtained from the skirts of Dartmoor. The dusky sweep of hills stretches away with an endless variety of form and outline ; in some parts sharply peaked, and crested with masses of broken rock ; at others, rounded and massive, and lifting a long line of sombre heath against the sky. The deep hollows which separate the hills are thickly covered with fern and heather, over which blocks of splintered granite are scattered in all directions ; and as in all similar districts, each valley has its own clear mountain stream, which receives the innumerable waterfalls des cending from the hill-sides. The whole country has a solitude, and an impressive grandeur, which insensibly carries back the mind to an earlier and ruder age ; in this respect resembling the heaths and mountains of the English border, and the solitary glens \" Up pathless Ettrick, or on Yarrow, Where erst the outlaw drew his arrow.\" Yet, although the Forest of Dartmoor and its bordering"], [62, "48 DARTMOOR. valleys have many points of striking resemblance to the rude moorlands of the North, they possess distinctive features which are peculiarly their own. The whole scenery is more suggestive of repose than that of Scotland. The solitary farm-houses, with their slanting gables and wide granite porches, which lie nestled in the windings of the glens, and sheltered by the heathery hills which rise behind them, could only belong to a country which had no fear of ' Willie of Westburnflat,' or ' Dan o' the Howlet Hirst.' There are no traces of annual burnings of the home- stead or the corn ricks ; and the good wife might at any time have gone quietly to rest, with but little fear of finding, when she rose in the morning, that her cattle had been driven off, and that ' her gear was a' gane.' In the valleys which lie along at the foot of Dartmoor, no ' towers of lime and stane ' rise up between their ancient ash trees, such as are scattered in such numbers throughout Eskdale and Liddesdale. There was no need of the bartizan, from which to watch the approach of the forayers as they came down over the distant hill-side ; or of the barmekin for the pro- tection of the cattle which belonged to each little moorland farm. The only enemies they had to guard against were ' winter and rough weather ; ' and accordingly, instead of choosing, as an English borderer would have done, a rising ground, which should command an uninterrupted view over the surrounding moors, the old settlers on the borders of Dartmoor looked out for the most sheltered hollow, gener ally preferring the head of the coombe or narrow valley, where the hills meet in a semi-circle above the house. In this manner almost every wooded glen, which runs up into the skirts of Dartmoor, contains more than one ancient farm, generally a long gabled house, of the time of"], [63, "DARTMOOR. 49 James I., with granite windows and open porch, above which a tablet is frequently placed, containing the date of its erection and the initials of its builders. The branches of two or three large old trees, which have been allowed to stand as much for shelter as for ornament, generally over- hang the low mossy walls of the courts and rickyards ; and sometimes an enormous walnut, a tree which was largely planted in Devonshire toward the beginning of the seven- teenth century, stands at the head of the little garden, bright with sun-flowers and hollyhocks, where the bee- hives are ranged along close under the mullions of the old windows. Below the farm, the coombe stretches away, gradually widening until it opens into the main valley ; sometimes cleared into meadow ground, where a wider space is left on the banks of the stream which flows along it, ' red from its heathery hill ; ' \u2014 and towards the broader opening, shewing rich tracts of a deep arable soil. Its steep rocky banks are covered with a thick growth of oak coppice and underwood, where the red berries of the mountain ash hang forth in heavy clusters, and the smooth leaves of the holly glitter in the sunlight. Above the coppice, on either side of the coombe, stretches the line of rough moorland ; in some places rising up bare and open ; at others hidden by the knotted branches of some outspreading oak or ash tree. Throughout its whole extent, the valley exhibits that mixture of rude uncultivated ground with the richest corn- land and pasture, which is far more ' delicious to the eye and the imagination ' than the order and regularity of the best-managed farm in a more open country. Marrow paths of the brightest greensward wind between the deep beds of fern and heather ; the broom and the foxglove fringe the edges of every copse, and spring up between the shafts of B"], [64, "50 DARTMOOR. granite that overhang the borders of the streams ; and patches of birch and hazel are scattered irregularly over the pasture, marking the gradual clearing of the valley from the wood with which it was once overgrown. It was from the fact that the most ancient inhabitants fixed their places of abode in the narrow valleys which are everywhere found intersecting the hills, that they acquired the name by which they first become known to us, \u2014 Danmonii \u2014 \" The men of the deep valleys.\" The access to these hill-farms must have been anciently of the rudest and most difficult character ; and many of them, even now, are inaccessible to a cart or wheeled carriage of any description. On such farms the whole work is clone by pack-horses ; and the good wife travels to church, like her predecessor in the days of Elizabeth, on a pillion, behind her master. Generally, the broken road which leads up through the valley has its steep sides covered with short heath and wild strawberries ; \" most toothsome to the palate,\" says Fuller, \" (I meane if with clarett wine or sweet cream) and so plentiful in this county that a traveller may gather them sitting on horseback in their hollow high wayes. I would not wish this countie the increase of these berries, according to the proverb, ' Cut down an oak, and set up a strawberrie.' \" Such is the character of the farm steadings which occupy the wooded valleys on the borders of the Moor. But within the bounds of the Forest itself, there exist many ancient ' Towns,' a word used in Cornwall as in Scotland, to denote a solitary or ' bye-farm,' with its outbuildings. Many of these are of great antiquity ; and in most instances, in addition to the shelter obtained from the hill that rises behind them, a situation has been chosen, where a better soil,"], [65, "DARTMOOR. 51 or the winding of a stream, might afford nourishment to a clump of forest trees, which, nothwithstanding, shew evident signs of many a year's hard battling with the mountain winds. These are generally ash trees or sycamores ; the last, a hardy and firm-growing tree, to whose strong and unyielding nature Sir Walter has compared the Scottish character ; but it is the ash which, of all forest trees, assimilates most completely with wild and lonely scenery ; nor is there one which can shew a better title to be regarded as the charac teristic tree of northern Europe. \" Oh, the oak, the ash, and the bonny ivy tree, They flourish best at hame in the North Countrie.\" It was, perhaps, from the mysterious feeling with which the old Saxon regarded it, that the ash was generally chosen as the ' household tree,' which marked the bounda ries of his farm, or was planted close to his dwelling; and still on the moors of Devonshire, where the house has long perished, and heather is growing over what was once corn land, the site of the homestead is marked by a clump of aged ash trees. In such situations the form and outline of the ash are widely different from those which it assumes on lower ground, where it spreads out its branches without fear of wind or storm. Its sprays of foliage are thinner and more curved ; and its moss-covered trunk is knotted and twisted, as though it had encountered fierce obstacles in its rising, and had put forth all its strength in the struggle. In early autumn, when the heather is purpling the hills, and the fern is beginning to assume that deep russet hue than which few woodland tints are more beautiful, the leaf of the ash becomes of a clear transparent golden colour, harmonisino- in the finest manner with the rich hues of the E2"], [66, "DxlRTMOOR. 52 surrounding landscape ; and even in mid-winter, when the leaves are fallen, and the long thin branches are 'resounding o'er the steep,' the presence of the old trees circling round the snowy roofs of the homestead, gives a feeling of shelter and of comfort, which nothing else could possibly bestow. There are, however, but few of such tree-sheltered ' steadings ' throughout the whole of the upper wastes. For the most part this entire region is bare and treeless ; and seen from one of the central heights it exhibits nothing but wide sweeps of fern and heather, above which the granite crests of thc tors rise in every direction. \" The scenes are desert now and bare, Where flourished once a forest fair, When these waste glens with copse were lined, And peopled with the hart and hind.\" The solitary thorn, which spreads its knotted branches over the hillocks of green turf by the river side, might relate as many ' changes of his parent dell,' as his more famous in-other of Ettrick. For, like the forests of the Scottish borders, the lower valleys of Dartmoor were anciently covered with a thick coppice of thorn, birch, hazel, and oak. Trunks and branches of all these trees are con stantly found in the mosses, especially in such as lie along the banks of the stream. Many names, for the most part of British origin, which are still given to particular spots in the Forest, indicate the ancient presence of wood ; and it is probable that the formation of the great bogs and morasses has partly been caused by the falling of the trees which once occupied their site. Many of these morasses are of great extent, and are covered with patches of the flowering rush, the ' cana grass ' of the Highlands, and more rarely, with"], [67, "DARTMOOR. 53 the sweet gale, or bog myrtle, whose narrow aromatic leaves are used in Sweden for brewing a peculiar kind of ale, such as the Picts are said to have made from the flowers of the heather. Among the rocks on the sides of the tors, and upon certain tracts of drier ground, especially over a district called Holming-beam, between the East Dart and the Cowsick rivers, the whortleberry grows in great abundance. \" In Latin, Vaccinia,\" says Fuller, who has recorded it, as well as the wild strawberry amongst the natural commodities of Devonshire, \" most wholesome to the stomake, but of a very astringent nature ; so plentiful in this shire, that it is a kind of harvest to poor people, whose children, nigh Axminster, will earne eight pence a day, for a month together, in gathering them. First they are green, then red, and at last a dark blew. The whitest hands among the Romans did not disdain their blacknesse ; witnesse the Poet \u2014 ' Vaccinia nigra leguntur. It is the wide extent of these solitary wastes which makes them so impressive, and gives them their influence over the imagination. Whether seen at mid-day, when the gleams of sunlight are chasing one another along the hill-side ; or at sunset, when the long line of dusky moorland lifts itself against the fading light of the western sky, the same character of extent and freedom is impressed on the landscape, which carries the fancy from hill to hill, and from valley to valley, and leads it to imagine other scenes, of equal wildness, which the distant hills conceal \" Beyond their utmost purple rim. Perhaps the scenery of Dartmoor is never more im pressive than under those evening effects which have"], [68, "54 DARTMOOR. last been suggested. The singular shapes assumed by the granite cappings of the tors are strongly projected against the red light of the sunset, which gleams between \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 the many openings in the huge piles of rock, making them look like passages into some unknown country beyond them, and suggesting that idea of infinity, which is afforded by no other object of sight in equal degree ! Meanwhile, the heather of the foreground is growing darker and darker ; and the only sound which falls upon the ear is that of the river far below, or perhaps the flapping of some heron's wings, as he rises from his rock in the stream, and disappears westward ; \" Where darkly painted on the blood-red sky, His figure floats along.\" \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9artntoor.

There are wastes and wilds, crags of granite, views into far off districts, and the sound of waters hurrying away over their rocky beds, enough to satisfy the largest hungering and thirsting after poetical delight. I shall never forget the feelings of delicious entrancement with which I approached the outskirts of Dartmoor. I found myself among the woods near Haytor Crags. It was an autumn evening. The sun, near its setting, threw its yellow beams amongst the trees, and lit up the ruddy tors on the opposite side of the valley into a beautiful glow. Below, the deep dark river went sounding on its way with a melancholy music, and as I wound up the steep road beneath the gnarled oaks, I ever and anon caught glimpses of the winding valley to the left, all beautiful with wild thickets and half-shrouded faces of rock, and still on high those glowing ruddy tors standing in the blue air in their sublime silence. My road wound up, and up, the heather and the bilberry on either hand showing me that cultivation had never disturbed the soil they grew in ; and one sole wood lark from the far-ascending forest to the right, filled the wild solitude with his wild autumnal note. At that moment I reached an eminence and at once saw the dark crags of Dartmoor high aloft before me, and one large solitary house in the valley beneath the woods. So fair, so silent, save for the woodlark's note and the moaning river, so unearthly did the whole scene seem \u2014 that my imagina tion delighted to look upon it as an enchanted land, \u2014 and to persuade itself that that house stood as it would stand for ages, under the spell of silence, but beyond the reach of death and change."], [72, "DARTMOOR. 58 Dartmoor.

Where over Devon's vales and woods Bleak Dartmoor lifts her summits stern And rivers pour their infant floods Through granite wastes of furze and fern, Deep in a rudely cultured nook (Hard by where Dart's red waters boil) A peasant dwelt, in heart and look Well sorted with that savage soil. Beneath his roof two pauper boys Were bound to earn their daily bread, Poor exiles from domestic joys, Who scarce had where to lay their head.

In cloudless gold the morning shone On Widdecombe's dark belt of hills, And gilt her tower the winter sun, And sparkled in her frozen rills ; The holy peal of Sabbath bells Proclaimed the solemn hour of prayer, And echoing o'er the moorland dells, Aroused the straggling hamlets there. oo o And with the rest those children joined The sacred work of praise and prayer, Nor dreamed how few brief days might find Their limbs beneath that cold turf there. \u2014 As home they turned, at evening fall, The heaven, erewhile so fair, grew brown ; And glimmering through a misty pall, The moon in sickly white shone down.

Rev. Samuel Rowe, M.A. The Moreton road from Sandypark will lead us directly to the bridge over the Teign, within a furlong from the inn. We shall not cross the bridge, but shall follow a beaten path on the left, down the river, along the northern bank. Following the course of the stream as it winds through the meadows, we shall soon reach that point where a rock crested headland rises abruptly above the lateral vale of Coombe on one side, and the wooded steeps of Whiddon Park press forward to narrow the valley on the other. Scarcely a quarter of a mile from this point, by keeping close to the river's brink on the north side, we shall discover thc Logan stone. Should the explorer inadvertently follow a more accessible track which winds along the side of the hill at a short distance above the river, he may pass the Logan stone without noticing it, as it stands among the numerous masses of granite with which the channel of the Teign is profusely strewed ; but by making his own path close to the brink, he will not fail to find the object of his search rising boldly out of the bed of the river near the northern bank. Proceeding down the river, we shall be greeted with some of the most striking vale scenery in the west of England. The course is a continuous succession of graceful curves ; the banks on the south, or Moreton side, clothed with wood and heather as high as the eye can reach, and on"], [87, "DARTMOOR. 73 the Drewsteignton slope presenting abrupt and bare de clivities, occasionally interspersed with craggy projections beetling above our rugged but romantic pathway. In one particular spot, high in the abrupt declivity, two bold cliffs will be observed jutting out from the hill like the ramparts of a redoubt guarding the narrow pass below. Lower down, the northern bank becomes wooded, and the path, pro ceeding through a jungle copse, at length emerges upon the Drewsteignton and Moreton road at Fingle Bridge. Here, let us pause on its narrow roadway \u2014 just wide enough for a single cart \u2014 to gaze from, its grey moorstone parapet on a scene the general features of which may be recorded by the pen, but of whose particular features of loveliness the pencil alone can convey an adequate idea. Three deeply scooped valleys converging to one point, two or three little stripes of greenest meadow-sward occupying all the narrow level at the foot of the encircling hills, the fortified head land of Prestonbury rising bold and precipitous, its rigid angular outline strikingly contrasted with the graceful undulations of the woody slopes which confront its southern glacis ; the mill at their base embowered in foliage, and the river clear and vigorous giving animation to the scene without marring its sylvan seclusion, all combine to form a scene of surpassing loveliness which it is a disgrace for any Devonians not to have visited before they set out in search of the picturesque to Wales or Cumberland or the Highlands, and still more before they make their continental peregrina tions, Or by the lazy Scheldt, or wandering Po, Or onward, where the rude Carinthian boor Against the houseless stranger shuts his door.\""], [88, "74 DARTMOOR. \u0152ijc jFcrng J$loorlanos. From The Fern Paradise, by Francis George Heath. 5th Ed. London: Sampson Low & Co. 1878. \" We one day made for the moors, in order to explore the ferny borders of Fingle Bridge, of Lustleigh Cleave, and of Horseman's Steps. Changing trains at Newton, we were not long in getting to our point of departure at Moreton hampstead. On this branch line, twelve miles in length, the changing scenes are supremely beautiful. During the whole distance the line passes along a valley which is pre eminently Devonian. It is curious and interesting to watch in the early summer the gradual substitution of the barren moorland for the cultivated tract. Grand slopes of rich greenwood, flower-dotted meadow, and June corn-crops standing proudly up, with rich promise for the -autumn \u2014 the light, waving green of the cornstalks and ears charm- o ' o o ingly contrasting with the red and full-blown poppies scattered in patches here and there \u2014 first meet the eye. But the cultivated land is shorn of no picturesque surround ings. Hill, wood, and river, each with its peculiar Devonian charm, intermingle in rich and varying proportions, flinging their characteristic grace over the whole. As we advance, however, cultivation becomes sparse and sparser still. The heights become too steep for anything but their own wild growth. There is, however, even until the broken moor is reached, a grand intermingling of wooded and barren steeps, of hilly corn-fields, and heather and Fern-covered heights. Then we pause at the extremity of thc branch line to More tonhampstead."], [89, "DA RTxUOOR. 75 Now begins the moorland walk, extending away for some three or four miles to Fingle Bridge. Along the entire distance there is spread out for the Fern-lover a continual feast. For a short way the path winds by the side of a meadow; then crosses, at the end of a small thicket, a Fern fringed brook. Anon it ascends a steep upland, and then for two miles it takes a course which includes all the wild and varied characteristics of moorland scenery. Now the interchained peaks of Dartmoor carry the eye away over a wide stretch of country, the vividly-coloured landscape losing in freshness, but losing nothing in grandeur, as the dimness of distance causes it to melt away in shadowy out lines. Now the eye rests on the graceful scenery which lies immediately contiguous to the path \u2014 huge boulders scattered about on each side, clothed with moss and Ferns ; rugged hedge-banks formed of slate-rock and red-sandstone teeming \u00a9 o with Fern life; slopes of furze and heather intermingled with wild flowers. Now the path descends the hill-side and lights on and traverses a glade strewn with boulders of all sizes and shapes, forming a natural rockery and giving congenial shelter to the roots of Bracken, whose tall fronds are spread out with a wild grace which no word-painting can adequately represent. Along the route which we have indicated, the Fern hunter may find, in charming variety, the Common Polypody, the Soft Prickly Shield Fern, the Male Fern, the Broad Buckler Fern, the Lady Fern, the Black Maidenhair Spleenwort, the Harts-tongue, and the Hard Fern. Few scenes can be more magnificent than the view which is to be obtained shortly after commencing the descent \u2014 a mile in length \u2014 which sweeps by a winding path down towards the vale of Fingle Bridge. We have to descend the"], [90, "76 DARTMOOR. densely-wooded side of a hill, and the path along nearly the whole way is overhung by trees. If we peer under the dense wooded cover that extends en either side of the path, we may well admire the splendid growth of the ferns that revel in the humid shelter of the greenwood. Following the downward course of the steep path, a clear ance in the trees, and a jutting point of the hill suddenly give the opportunity for a sight which is sublimely beautiful. We stand at a height far above the vale of Fingle Bridge. From our feet, down to the extreme point of the narrow valley, sweeps a dense mass of trees, gracefully curving round to the left, until it is almost met by the lofty wood-covered hill that rears its head boldly against the sky on the opposite side of the valley. We have said that the wood-covered hills almost meet. Their bases interlace ; but a clear space intervenes between their tops, giving a marvellous combination of varying moorland scenery in the vista between. Hills \u2014 some densely wooded, others bare and wild \u2014 interlace their tops in a symmetrical network, \u25a0which stretches away until dimly defined in the far-off distance. On the right, in varying terraces which rise towards the sky, is a mixed landscape of meadow and hedge and tree. Down far beneath, rushing along under a dark overgrowth of trees, roar the waters of the Teign, just seen away to the left, where a break in the canopy of overhanging green reveals the dark and foaming current. O O Winding round and round to lighten the roughness and steepness of the descent, the path at length reaches the extreme point of the valley, and crossing a swift, dark mill stream that runs for a short distance parallel with the Teign, emerges on to Fingle Bridge. This spot is, indeed, a chosen land of Ferns, To the right and to the left, away from the"], [91, "DARTMOOR. 77 arches of the bridge, the Teign brawls over and between the granite boulders which are strewn in its bed : now sparkling in pebbly shallows ; now deepening into sluggish pools ; now roaring in mimic fury over miniature falls ; now calmly flowing by its silent banks, which overhung with the deep green foliage of clustering shrubs, afford shady nestling places for waving Fern-fronds which lap the surface of the stream, and lend to it a graceful and beautiful aspect. At a short distance to the right of the bridge the stream is lost from sight ; but from its boulder-strewn, roaring course the eye is naturally lifted to the glorious view which is to be seen overhead. On both sides, almost from the water's brink, rise two precipitous hills, \u2014 the one on the right, clothed with a dark green mantle extending from the surface of the stream to the extreme hill-top by the gradation . of shrub and bush and tree : that on the left sparsely covered with furze and heather ; but both endowed with that boldness of aspect which lends grandeur to a scene. Away to the left of the bridge a similar scene meets the eye ; but here both hill-sides which bound the stream are densely and darkly clothed with trees, which sweeping upwards finely contrast with the delightful blue of the sun lit sky, as the hill-tops cut the sheen. The blue sky with its golden sunshine, the green woods, the graceful waving Ferns and the brawling river combine to make an exquisite picture. After a peep at the bridge scenery, we followed a path which led down to the left, along by the river side. Huge granite boulders were scattered about in mid stream ; and some of these, clustered in the form of a rocky islet, were approachable from the river-side by stepping-stones which offered a dry passage for the tourist. On this boulder islet"], [92, "78 DARTMOOR. we rested for refreshment \u2014 the cool stream flowing on each side of us gurgling and splashing and flashing in the sun, the calm surface of its silent pools, where the current was pent by the rocks, being broken only from time to time by the splash of the rising trout, as they dashed at the flies which skimmed the surface of the water. From this point on the same side of the bridge, a path skirted for a short way the brawling course of the stream. We followed this path for some distance, and we found that it was a walk that would well repay the Fern hunter for a long journey across rugged moorlands. It is indeed almost impossible to express in words the keen sense of enjoyment experienced during so delightful a ramble as this river-side path afforded. We thread a narrow path along a. grassy sward. Beneath, soft verdant carpeting thickly strewn with wild flowers ; above us a delightful canopy formed of the interlaced branches of trees, through which the screened sunlight ' o O softly falls. On our right a high embankment, leading up to a higher path on the hill-side, from out of which hang tufts of Fern fronds mingled in charming variety. Down to our left rolls the river, whose music joins in chorus with the songs of the birds, singing, we know not where, but everywhere around us. As we follow this charming river- side path, we have from time to time to press through the dense masses of shrubs which surround us \u2014 now hanging o o down overhead, now springing from the left, and now from the right side. The small, but startling, incidents of the route add a sort of piquancy to the enjoyment. The sudden flutter and the wild cry of a blackbird, as it darts out of the tiny thicket where its nest is hid ; the rustle in the high embankment on our right, and the quivering of"], [93, "DARTMOOR. 79 the Fern frond, followed by the sudden flight across the path of a rabbit ; the rolling, hurry-scurrying contortions of a snake, which our unexpected appearance has surprised, basking in the tiny gleam of sunshine which has fallen on to the greensward through an opening in the trees over head ; the heavy splash in the river on our left as a water rat, which had not dreamed of our unwelcome intrusion, takes the shortest and readiest path to his hole, diving one moment in one place into the stream, to re-appear the next somewhere else, under the belief that meanwhile his power of holding his breath is unlimited ; or the lighter splash of a trout, as unaware of our presence, it rises in the dark, deep pool near us at the tempting palmer-fly that has just dropped from the bushes. All these sights and sounds con tribute to the delight of this river-side ramble. Or we may rest for a moment, and peering cautiously around us, so as not to disturb the free inhabitants of the woodland, admire and enjoy their unrestrained movements. The snake will wriggle on to the sunlit path again; the rabbit will come quietly out from his hiding-place ; the rat wdll return from his hole ; the trout will skim about on the surface of the river close to where we are sitting, if our shadow does not fall across the sunlit pool. As we sit and rest, we may listen with a deep sense of enjoyment to the soft buzzings of the insects which surround us ; and watch the bushes, the grass, the ground, and the water. Eveiywhere there is life \u2014 fresh, delightful, enjoyable life. Such a scene as we have attempted to describe is not imaginary. It is real and tangible. Who that has visited Devonshire has not experienced the varied and varying sensations of a ramble so essentially Devonian ? After pursuing this river-side path for some little distance,"], [94, "80 DARTMOOR. we reached a waterfall, where a division in the river makes provision for the stream which drives the mill at Fingle Bridge. Close by the fall there is a light and open planta tion of small trees, and underneath these a tiny forest of ferns. Bracken in glorious luxuriance clothe the ground, and splendid forms of the Male Fern also abound in this wood. The dark stream, too, which flows by the wood is fringed with some beautiful specimens of the Lady Fern, of all sizes. Here also is the lemon-scented Mountain Buckler Fern. We saw a number of these lovely plants. It was no wonder that the ferns in this delightful grove were so luxuriant, for the soil consisted of nothing but spongy, sandy, leaf mould. The soft and exquisitely beautiful scenery in, around, and above this charming wood it is almost impossible to describe. The ground covered with waving fern fronds ; on one side the foaming waterfall, on the other the river with its fern-fringed banks ; above, the interlaced tops of the trees in the grove, through which might be seen the great wood-covei-ed hills which shut in the prospect all round, and towering up against the blue sky, seemed almost to fold over us like a delightful canopy with a loveliness that cannot be described. From Fingle Bridge back to Moretonhampstead along the intricate moorland path. From Moretonhampstead to Horseman's Steps, across four miles of delightful country, and through ferny valleys, up ferny hills, and through ferny lanes. This was our route on the day of our visit to the ferny borders of Dartmoor. We reach, near Horseman's Steps, a solitary cottage, perched in a charming nook. Close by the cottage walls, the North Bovey River, pent into a narrow bed, roars over the big boulders that choke up its course, Here we have the charming combination of water-"], [95, "DARTMOOR. 81 fall, cascade and silent pool. The huge masses of granite which lie along the course of this stream are in many places delightfully carpeted with moss, whose deep and light-green colouring looks charmingly fresh where the limpid water flows over or near it. A short distance from this spot are the far-famed Horseman's Steps. The narrow course of the North Bovey River is here completely blocked by enormous masses of granite, and we can only see the stream by peering down between interstices in the rocks ; but we can hear it thundering along in its almost subterranean channel. A small tract of marsh land intervenes between Horseman's Steps and Lustleigh Cleave ; and there we found, along by the course of the North Bovey River, numbers of the Mountain Buckler Fern, the Hard Fern, the Lady Fern, the Male Fern, the Broad Buckler Fern, and others. In this district is to be found the somewhat rare Tunbridge Filmy Fern, Wilson's Filmy Fern, and the delicate and beautiful Marsh Buckler Fern. From this point a precipitous ascent leads on to Lustleigh Cleave. We can give no better description of this cleave than by comparing it to a huge fern rockery. By some singular agency, the hill-sides have been strewn with blocks of granite, of all shapes and sizes. It is really difficult to understand how this curious phenomenon could have been produced, though it would seem that volcanic action of some kind must have had something to do with the original formation of Lustleigh Cleave. But the present effect is singularly beautiful. Here, as elsewhere, the ferns have taken possession of the ground, and have given an in describably graceful aspect to the strewn boulders. Reaching the top of the cleave, after a toilsome ascent, we made for the Logan or Nutcracker Rock. Near this rock, peering Q"], [96, "82 DARTMOOR. into the stony crevices, we made a pleasing discovery. We found in one of the interstices, between the gigantic masses of granite which cover the hill-top, several specimens of the Lanceolate Spleenwort. They were growing in one little cluster, and in the dark shadow of their retreat we could not at first be sure that they were not the beautiful but commoner Black Maidenhair Spleenwort. We knew, how ever, that from the position in which they were growing, it was quite possible they might be Asplenium Lanceolatum. With the aid of a long stick we succeeded in digging them out ; and a close examination at once gave proof that the plants we had discovered were what we had hoped they would prove to be. The fronds of the Black Maidenhair Spleenwort are always broadest at their base, narrowing gradually towards their apex, the spores being arranged in lines at the back of the fronds. The fronds of Lanceolatum taper at both ends towards their apices and towards their bases, and its spores when ripe are gathered in little round clusters on the back of its fronds. The distinguishing O O characteristics of this species were present in our ' find.' We had previously hunted in numerous places in South Devon for Asplenium lanceolatwm, and had carefully explored several of its known habitats, but without being able to find a single plant. Those who have experienced it know the pleasure derived by the Fern hunter when, after a long search, he at length lights on the variety for which he has been seeking. \u00a9 Down the side of the Cleave towards Lustleigh ; through a boulder lane \u2014 -huge masses of granite piled up on each side, and almost hidden by Ferns and moss\u2014 and away by hill-side, meadow and stream towards Totnes ! So ended our delightful ramble for that day across the ferny moor lands.\""], [97, "DARTMOOR. 83 & prospect on Dartmoor. Sophie Dixon. Wild scene amid the heathy fells !

A clear, vigorous stream ripples cheerily down the dell, to turn the busy mill at the end of the hamlet ; graceful shelving acclivities are partitioned by varied foliage into green crofts or blooming garden grounds; substantial farm-steads, and whitewashed cottages peep from among the orchards or are nestled under sheltering trees. Boulder rocks, with thickets and copse interspersed, protrude from the soil on the higher ground, while the far famed Lustleigh Cleave, with its granite barrier, fences in the vale from the storms of the neighbouring moor. The combination of rural scenery of this particular class, thus presented in this sequestered spot, is certainly not surpassed, if equalled, in any other part of Devonshire.

But if we should fail in identifying any Druidical relic in this rocky labyrinth, the smiling combe of Lustleigh below, contrasted with the stern magnificence of the moor land heights above, will abundantly repay the trouble of the explorer ; and some will think the picturesque masses of rock, with shrubs and foliage springing up from their fissures, in the evergreen crofts of the little hamlet of Ham merslake just below, are worthier of notice and admiration than the more conspicuous and celebrated Cleave itself.

In whatever direction the eye turns, the same slightly undulating but unvarying surface of heath, common and morass presents itself.

Yet in this very monotony there is a charm, for it gives birth to a feeling"], [109, "DARTMOOR. 95 that you are now in the domains of primeval Nature, and that this is one of the few spots where no indication of man's presence or occupancy is to be traced.

Hence, then, in imagina tion we follow the mountain-born streams along their devious course to the distant ocean, through green pastures and wavy cornfields, by the noisy mill and the plenteous farm ; now lingering by the fragrant-blossomed orchard, and now sweeping by the golden furze-clad hill ; now flashing in sunshine along the enamelled meadows, and now darkling O ' o beneath deep \" o'er arching groves ; \" at one time mirroring the simple cottages and grey steeple of the sequestered village, and anon, where the tidal waters have widened into o * ' a lake and deepened into a harbour bearing on their ample bosom the riches of commerce and the terrors of war, \u2014 reflecting the bristling masts of the crowded port, or the guarded battlements of the frowning citadel. All these are present to the mind's eye ; and whilst by contrast with the visible objects around, they render the desert still more waste and lonely, they will not fail to remind us of the justice of the poet's acknowledgment of the obligations of the smiling lowlands to Dartmoor, as \" the source of half their beauty.\""], [110, "96 THE TEIGN. \u00ae DefjottsJjtre. \u0152rout Stream. Richard John King. From the Standard, 20 July, 1874. If the season has been so far not such a one as \" Piscator\" most delights in ; if the April skies were too bright and cloudless, and if the long-continued drought has rendered even Dartmoor streams somewhat too shallow, many Springs have, nevertheless, gone by since the country looked half as lovely as at present. The moorlands are fresh and breezy ; the valleys axe rich with a depth of greenwood as yet unstained and unruffled. It is pleasant to pass from the whirl of Piccadilly to the landscapes that brighten the walls of Burlington House, and which charm all the more by contrast ; and it may not be disagreeable to the reader to escape for ten minutes from the noise and hurry of the great city, whilst he traces the windings of a Devonshire trout stream. We will try to paint them for him in a series of \" pictures.\" The stream is the Teign ; rising in the solitary central recesses of Dartmoor, and flowing onward by wood and wold, deep glens and sunlit meadow, until it reaches the sea at the pleasant watering-place of Teignmouth. Our first station is on Kestor Rock, rising against the horizon like a dark \" Kist \" or ark just above the point where the stream leaves the moorlands and loses itself among the oaks of Gidleigh Chase. The rock was once a famous haunt of ravens, and it commands a grand panorama. From this foreground of granite grey with lichens, and tufted with"], [111, "97 THE TEIGN. whortleberry through clefts that divide the masses of piled rock, the moorland stretches away on all sides covered with boulders and marked by hut circles and long lines of wall division ; for we are among the relics of a great primitive settlement. Away to the west, steep \" backs \" of heathery hill rise ridge beyond ridge, their long sky outlines broken here and there by tors of granite ; and far below Kestor,but nearer to us, winds and flashes the stream through a middle distance bright with young bracken, and with the fresh turf of moor grass threading the darker heath. East and south, the vast prospect dies away into a far blue haze \u2014 fields, woods, farms, villages, and church towers \" in fair confusion mingled.\" Northward the hill slopes steeply to the river, and beyond it the rough banks are scattered with birch and oak trees, outposts of the closer ranks of the Chase. The scene is a grand one ; but it is the life animating and stirring it \u2014 the wind singing among the rock crevices, the O O o o ' white clouds full of morning light journeying swiftly across the sky, the shadows that chequer the landscape and vary with each moment, the vqices of birds, and the sound of the river rising fitfully upwards from the rocky hollows where it sparkles in the sun \u2014 it is all this movement and variety that gives the highest charm, and which the most perfect landscape-artist can but indistinctly suggest. But he might profit by the figures which, on this fresh spring morning, give in Southey's words, \" a human interest to the solitude.\" Flocks of sheep scattered over the moors are being driven inward towards the oki farm, whose roofs and wide courts are just visible among the sycamores. Farm lads on rough ponies gallop from hillock to hillock. Their shouting, the sheep-cries, and the barking of half-a-dozen dogs \u2014 black and white, and full of cleverness, though hardly H"], [112, "98 THE TEIGN. so picturesque as a north country colley \u2014 are sounds well in keeping with the wild, sparkling landscape. Through scenes such as this all the trout streams of Dart moor pass in the earlier part of their course. We cannot here see the actual spring-head of the Teign ; but taking the stream for our guide, and looking toward the distant moor land, we can make out a green hollow under the shelter of one of the roughest and steepest ridges, which is not far from the source, and where the first dwelling rises by the side of the stream. It is difficult to imagine a more lonely abiding place. Those whose home it is are so far from \" Kirk and market \" that they are necessarily independent of both, and in winter they are sometimes snowed up for weeks together. It is one of those isolated dwellings which are the last strongholds of half-heathen beliefs and supersti tions driven from the cultivated country. Such isolation sharpens the wits in some directions ; for there are no neighbours to consult, and everything must be done without more assistance than the house affords. But the silence of this central moorland, the long shadow}'' summer twilights, the dark winter nights, are the very nurses of old-world superstition ; and this household \u2014 the farmer and his family have been here for nearly half-a century \u2014 has a sad, half-scared look, as if mysterious sights and sounds had indeed oppressed it, but were too common to be overmuch cared for. The river, in former days, seems to have brought such fancies downward with its waters, as it conveys the seeds of moor plants, and as it is haunted by the ring ouzel ; the sycamore-shadowed farm to which the sheep are driving, was once the house of a substantial franklin, and has the initials of its builder, with the date 1590, on a granite"], [113, "THE TEIGN. 99 tablet over the entrance. An older house had been inhabited by the same family for many centuries. After the new one was built and duly finished, the continuance of the race seemed to be promised by the birth of a son, for which the franklin and his wife had long been hoping in vain. But other creatures had also been hoping, and now watched their opportunity. On a winter evening, when the light had nearly faded, and the turf fire had fallen low, the mother slept for a moment instead of keeping watch over her child in the cradle. As she woke, she heard a strange low laugh, and thought she saw the flutter of a grey cloak. But the child was gone. The earthmen had bided their time ; and the letters T.W. above the new doorway remain, the initials of the last of a long descended race. The house, it was thought, had been built of granite from some rock under the special protection of the hill folk, and the first human being born in it had thus fallen into their power. Leaving the breezy height of Kestor, we descend the river toward our next picture. The passage of a stream from open moorland to its first clothing of wood is always marked by scenes specially delightful to the eye and the imagination. Scattered birches and hollies first appear. Then the trees spread upward close and more close along the steep river banks ; and at last, broken into a thousand waterbreaks among the boulders that bar its course, the stream disappears under the branches of the \" greenwood.\" Here we pass into this pleasant region by a fisherman's path, winding along banks set with wild flowers. \" There blooms the strawberry of the wilderness, The trembling eyebright shows her sapphire blue, The thyme her purple like the blush of even,\" through thickets of sweet gale filling all the air with its H2"], [114, "THE TEIGN. 100 aromatic scent, and at last, through a wilderness of Osmunda, the royal fern lifting its great ash-leaved fronds almost above our heads, and fluttering with changing colour in the breeze. This is its chosen home, and it has taken full possession of the river side for at least a quarter of a mile. It ceases as the oaks close up, and then we enter a region of mingled shadow and sunlight, in strong contrast with the open moors through which the stream has hitherto been winding. The banks slope gently upwards from the river, thick set with ancient oak trees, and with an undergrowth of holly and hazel. The river bed itself is full of great boulders, splashed sometimes with bright green mosses, and marked every where with tinted lichens. Through them the water foams and struggles, reposing for a moment in some rare pool, where \" trouts bedropt wi' crimson hail \" hover in the black depths. A narrow line of cloud-flecked sky opens above the tree-tops along the course of the stream, and in one place the sun lights up a younger oak bursting into leaf in all the \" glad bright green \" of Chaucer's forest pictures. It is almost golden in its brightness, with a great jutting boulder at its root, over which the water pours in a full, sparkling fall. The brightness and the flutter of young leaves in every way recal Chaucer with his delight in this spring season of birds and daisies ; and as if to give life to his verses, a bushy-tailed squirrel runs along a projecting bough of the oak tree and springs with a sharp cry into the branches on the farther side. This is the point for an artist, who may find his fore ground in the midst of the river. Below we reach the enclosures of Gidleigh Park, and the scene, though still wild, shows that it has not been left entirely to the \" sweet will \" and influences of nature. But wander as we may, so long as we keep within sight"], [115, "THE TEIGN. 101 and sound of the stream we cannot go far wrong. By many a hamlet and picturesque old mill, through lovely pastures, and under great whitethorns, each tree at this season a hill of snow, we descend towards Fingle Bridge, where the Teign passes through a narrow gorge, one of the most striking bits of hill scenery in Devonshire. The hills rise up some hundred feet sheer on either side of the river. There is only a scrambling path along them, and to climb to the heights is no small labour.

Beneath the garish beam of day I've often marked this scene before ; When field, and hill, and moorland grey One aspect broad of beauty wore.

From The Nm-th Devon Scenery Book, 1863, by George Tugwell, M.A. Five miles from Clovelly is Hartland Town ; a very quiet street of grey-stone cottages and white-washed houses on a high and windy table-land. They say it rains a good deal at Hartland ; and no doubt it does, for, put out of the question the obvious fact that the moist air-currents of the gulf -stream are naturally condensed by the first high land they encounter, it seems evident that it rains at Hartland because there is nothing else for the weather to do there. But one must not murmur, for the Inn is the perfection of a country Inn, and the weather is, on this occasion, faultless. So, after the earliest of breakfasts, we set out for Hart land Point. We lose ourselves in a labyrinth of ferny lanes which have had no apparent beginning, and certainly seem to be without end ; and at last having gone across country in sheer hopelessness and desperation, we are pulled up by an irate farmer in the middle of what he is good enough to o O call his wheat-field, and whom I unnecessarily exasperate by remarking that the field is sufficiently visible, but that the wheat is very much the reverse. At length we arrive at the Point, which is the peak of a narrow promontory running far out into the Atlantic. As we ramble cautiously up the narrowest of paths to its steep afid slippery summit, the wind buffets us to its heart's content ; when once on the platform which is thc termination of all things we are suddenly becalmed, for the western sea breeze strikes against the perpendicular scarp of the pro-"], [126, "112 NORTH DEVON. montory, and by virtue of an obvious mechanical law, rises vertically and leaves the peak to a strange and unexpected quiet. On either side the view of the coast-line is magnificent, needle points of hard black slate-rock dart out into the white-crested sea ; the cliffs are sheer ; the beach is a level pavement of vertical strata cut at right-angles by the cease less action of the stormy sea, and strewn with chaotic boulders of black slate and white quartz. One can almost hear these huge masses grinding and clanging together as the great Atlantic rollers tower in on stormy winter nights, and nothing living lives where they are omnipotent. The day is wearing onwards when I am again in the outskirts of Hartland Town, and thence walk rapidly along the hilly road which leads to Hartland Quay. We pass through a lovely valley by the banks of a ferny trout-stream which glides seaward beneath magnificent oaks. Here is Hartland Abbey, stretching bar-like across the vale, a stately and impressive pile of buildings, modernised as it is for modern uses. On the hill above, the lofty tapering tower of the Abbey Church soars high into the air. The church of S. Nectan would alone repay the trouble of a long and toilsome journey. Thoroughly restored as it is, its great charm is that it has never become thoroughly dilapidated. The stained windows, the reading desk and reredos are of modern care, and the stone altar and credence table have been removed from the neighbouring Abbey, but the rest of the church is as it always was. There is a magnificent carved and coloured oaken screen with parcloses of like work ; there are massive open seats ; there is a glorious vista from tower arch to altar steps. I climb the beautiful tower ; high in the wind is a peal of eight bells, and on the"], [127, "NORTH DEVON. 113 great tenor is the engraven legend \" Watch : for ye know not the hour of death.\" From the lofty summit is a view over valley and stream, and wood and sea, which I do not think I shall easily forget. Then, for the day is now waning, I walk rapidly down to Hartland Quay ; where at the foot of beetling cliffs a curved pier of solid masonry appears to grow out of the solid rock, and forms a seemingly-insecure harbourage for the fisher men's boats in stormy weather. Beyond again, to the westward, we ramble on over the cliffs, whose every turn and angle makes one lament that more time had not been given to this district, which is by far the most picturesque part of the North of Devon. Here is Catharine Tor, a huge rounded hill cut in two by the encroaching ocean, as by a giant's sword ; and here I am standing once more on the rocky beach at the crowning point of my westward rambles \u2014 for here are Milford Water falls. A moorland stream has forced its way through the heart of the iron cliffs ; first it makes a sheer leap of a hundred feet down a black rock into a black and whirling pit, now it rushes downwards through the murky ravine with another mighty fall, and still another, and then there is a dark pool at the base of the contorted scarp, into which the crested breakers of the spring flood are dashing with a wild and angry roar. We hasten homewards by the light of the cloudy moon as best we may, and I resolve that my next Devonshire holiday shall be devoted to Hartland country only. I"], [128, "114 NORTH DEVON. Ciobrllu. From Tlie North Devon Scenery Book, 1863, By Rev, Geokoe Tugwell, M.A. The road from Bideford to Clovelly is a high and pleasant one, full of those undulations which a wise pedestrian loves who knows that a long flat is more trying to his muscles than any hills which were ever upheaved ; full too of cool tracts of grateful shade, and gemmed as it were with many sudden and shining glimpses of the neighbouring sea. At the ninth mile-stone we come within sight of the \" Hobby \" Gate, which will admit us to that most facile and umbrageous of Clovelly approaches. But, under advice, I continue the main road for another hundred yards or so, and thus arrive at Clovelly Dykes, the remains of an old British camp of great extent, and in marvellously perfect preservation. Having duly inspected this relic of ancient days, I repass the Lodge gates and stroll leisurely down the Hobby road, which winds for ever and ever along the hill side, through a charming wilderness of stately timber-trees and luxuriant undergrowth. A profusion of flowers and ferns for the botanist, of cuttings and sections of contorted ' o strata for the geologist, of lovely vistas of wood, and glimpses of the neighbouring sea for the artist, render this walk attractive in no common degree, and I leave its well worn track with regret, and find myself under the shadow of full-foliaged oaks in a grass-green lane which must needs shortly conduct me to Clovelly. Soon afterwards we came upon a tiny grey church with a low square tower, which in no way seems markworthy ; close by is a well-kept Rectory, and opposite is Clovelly"], [129, "NORTH DEVON. 115 Court' with its large handsome conservatory and gay gardens. These latter look sufficiently tempting, but although I am invited to pay them a visit I venture to decline, and enquire anxiously for the whereabouts of Clovelly village, which is quite invisible, although one seems to have arrived at the very land's end. \" It's just down there, Sir,\" says the civil woman whom I am questioning. I followed the direction of her hand, and my eye falls over the wooded cliff, and plunges into the sea. \" Where ? \" I ask again. \" There ! \" she replies, pointing seawards with outstretched finger. \" Why, that's Lundy ! \" I retort rather pettishly, for the weather is hot, and I am not in the humour for practical jokes. Finally, I discover that my informant is in sober earnest ; and I apologise, and marvel, and proceed. Presently, always among trees, I come upon the head of a ravine which rushes down into the sea at an angle of about fifty degrees. From its wooded summit down to the pebbly beach at its base falls a perfectly unique cataract of cottages, descending in an unbroken white straight line. So sheer is the fall that the eaves of every house are on a level with the foundations of its higher and immediate neighbour. The street itself is paved with well-worn boulders from the shore, arranged in a series of irregular stairs, down whose steeps \" I slip, I slide,\" brook- fashion, in increasing bewilderment. By and by the double line of cottages coalesce, and all further descent seems impracticable, but on a sudden we discover a dark passage passing through and under an ancient house, well-eaved and gabled after the picturesque manner of houses of olden days. So we dive into the tunnel f"], [130, "116 NORTH DEVON. and come out quite unexpectedly upon the quay, where the herring boats, with their red sails and festoons of endless nets, are grinding idly against the water-worn stones of the narrow winding gangway. Beyond is a rude and Inassive pier which thrusts out its encircling and protecting arm into the rippling waters of the bay ; at its extremity I pause and look down upon the sea which is still below me, and there is a rough ladder so wet and worn and perpendicular, that one's breath is positively taken away at the suggestion of the possibility of embarking by means of its dangerous aid. Then I look up at the cascade of white houses, and only wonder how I or any other man could have accomplished the dizzy descent. t After securing a sketch of the main features of this most unique of villages from an advantageous point of view to the eastward of the pier, I pass the rest of the day in rambling by the cliffs through the grounds of Clovelly Court, which with kindly liberality are thrown open to all comers. Lovely indeed are the wildernesses of virgin grass and deepest fern, and darkest oak shadows ; pleasant are the resting-places on the summits of wooded cliffs, where one could rest for ever and absorb the quiet country beauty of the land and the ever-changing charms of the stately sea. That sullen promontory in the west is Harty Point, haunted by all strong winds and waves on blackest winter nights ; and that silver bar of light in front is Lundy, a granite peak, restful ever in the ever restless sea.

Charles Dickens in A Message /ron thc Sea. \" The village was built sheer up the face of a steep and lofty cliff. There was no road in it, there was no wheeled vehicle in it, there was not a level yard in it. From the sea-beach to the cliff-top two irregular rows of white houses, placed opposite to one another aud twisting here and there, and there and here, rose like the sides .of a long succession of stages of crooked ladders, and you climbed up the village or climbed down the village by the staves between, some six feet wide or so, and made up, of sharp, irregular stones. The old pack-saddle, long laid aside in most parts of England as one of the appendages of its infancy, flourished here intact. Strings of pack-horses and pack-donkeys toiled slowly up the staves of the ladders, bearing fish and coal, and such other cargo as was unshipping at the pier from the dancing fleet of village boats, and from two or three little coasting traders. As the beasts of burden ascended laden, or des cended light, they got so lost at intervals in the floating clouds of village smoke, that they seemed to dive down some of the village chimneys, and come to the surface again far off, high above others. No two houses in the village were alike, in chimney, size, shape, door, window, gable, roof -tree, anything. The sides of the ladders were musical with water, running clear and bright. The staves were musical with the clattering feet of the pack-horses and pack-donkeys, and the voices of the fishermen urging them up, mingled with the voices of the fishermen's wives and their many children. The pier was musical with the wash of the sea, the"], [132, "118 NORTH DEVON. creaking of capstans and windlasses, and the airy fluttering of little vanes and sails. The rough sea-bleached boulders of which the pier was made, and the whiter boulders of the shore, were brown with drying nets. The red-brown cliffs, richly wooded to their extremest verge, had their softened and beautiful forms reflected in the bluest water, under the clear North Devonshire sky of a November day without a cloud. The village itself was so steeped in autumnal foliage from the houses giving on the pier, to the topmost round of the topmost ladder, that one might have fancied it was out a bird's-nesting and was, (as indeed it was) a wonderful climber. And mentioning birds, the place was not without some music from them too ; for the rook was very busy on the higher levels, and the gull with his flapping wings was fishing in the bay, and the lusty little robin was hopping among the great stone blocks and iron rings of the break water, fearless in the faith of his ancestors and the \"Children in the Wood.\" &be f&ohhrj, \u0152lo&ellp..

Away below us on our right the sea is softly murmuring on the shingle beach, its blue expanse dotted here and there with white sails. Looking across and beyond the high cliff which rises over the wooded height under which from this point Clovelly appears to nestle, Lundy island is seen stretching its length across the sea. Now, as we go on, screening trees close over our path, and the scene changes"], [137, "NORTH DEVON. 123 in detail. On our left a gently sloping bank, now densely crowded under its overgrowth of trees with fern forms. On our right also a. sloping bank now falling gently and now steeply to the sea, and now presenting a level surface charmingly wooded and Fern dotted. Then for a moment the sea is hidden by a ferny bank on our right, but almost immediately it again bursts on the view, seen through the leafy openings in the trees on the steep bank on our right. In a minute or two more we get a peep by the beach of two or three of the white houses of Clovelly, and we catch sight momentarily of the foreshore of its harbour. Then as our road descends, we lose sight of the little place. But it is only for a moment, for anon we come upon an opening on our right, where an iron chair invitingly placed tempts us to be seated, and to look on the pretty little town. Charming indeed is the scene which now opens before us. Down away below us on our left nestles a wooded glen, its sides densely clothed with a dark-green mantle of trees. At the foot of this glen two bright-green meadows lie, whose lighter verdure charmingly contrasts with the darker shade of the trees above them. Away in front is the tiny harbour of Clovelly, backed by its sloping beach, both calmly resting at the foot of the wooded hill topped by a bare cliff, which rises high over it. Beyond all, the blue sea with Lundy island again in sight. Turning from this spot, our road for a little distance is free from the shadow of overarching trees, and there is nothing to shelter us from the fiery glare of the July sun, save that the soft sea-breeze wdiich gently fans us imparts a delicious coolness. Presently, however, our path winding round and descending takes us by a rude stone bridge to the opposite side of the wooded glen we have just described."], [138, "124 NORTH DEVON. Here are we indeed in a veritable paradise of Fern-land. Compelled to pause for a moment by the delightful sense of delicious coolness which comes over us, we take our stand upon the bridge, lean over its huge parapet and look down, attracted by the music of the flowing stream beneath, at the wealth of ivy clothing its arches \u2014 the dark green leaves of the delightful climber being relieved here and there by glossy fronds of the lighter-coloured hartstongue, which peep out from rootstocks nursed under the moist and con genial shelter of the ivy-trailers. We linger but a moment, however, upon this wealth of evergreen. The dreamy murmur of the stream below us, as it runs down to the bottom of the ravine to the sea, rivets our attention. The sides of the ravine shelve steeply to the bed of the stream, the trees on each side of which droop forward to meet each other from opposite sides, their ivy-and-moss-covered branches interlacing. From each side of the stream-bank, under the moist shelter of the overhanging trees, huge ferny forms fling out their graceful fronds, and mingling with the wealth of green branches away beyond, form a vista beneath which the stream disappears, its murmur becoming less and less distinct as it melts away in the distance. Turn we now to the opposite side of this rustic bridge, and we shall get a charming peep at a spot where Nature delightfully holds her own. In mid-stream a few yards above the bridge, an islet is planted narrowing- on each side of it the channel of the brook whose waters, divided for a moment into two rills, unite again ere they flow under the dark arches. A charming bit of Fern-land is this same islet, formed no doubt by the aggregation of earthy particles arrested by a group of stones in mid-stream ; but as we see it, with its ferny fronds and moss and ivy, it is one dense"], [139, "NORTH DEVON. 125 mass of delicious green. Snugly sheltered as it is by the protecting shadows of little trees, which in their turn are sheltered by the larger tree-growth above them, the green and graceful tops of the Ferns are nevertheless silvered by a few rays of the July sun which have coyly crept down to the stream through the overgrowth of arching branches, which in a wealth of leafiness spread themselves like a canopy between the blue sky and the glancing waters of the music-loving brook. Leaving this charming spot, and rounding the glen which on our right opens up in all its splendour to the sea, nothing being seen but sea and wood, the two sides of the glen uniting in a point, our path rapidly descends. We cross another murmuring stream tumbling down the glen to the sea, and then we appear to be almost lost in a sylvan maze. On our right is the musical glen, on our left a hillock, steep and tree-crowned, with trees of stately growth overarching ferny banks. On we go, our road winding round and round, and down and o ' o ' down \u2014 giving ever-changing peeps of steep glen and ferny bank, blue sea and sky \u2014 until we come at length upon a spot whence we appear to be looking out from a leafy heaven upon the snug little world of Clovelly lying below us, and seen only between the leafy interstices of the trees, its white-slated and thatched houses clustering on the hill-side. For a moment the place has the appearance of being buried under the trees. So much indeed do the trees outslant, that they appear as if they had been hewn down and thrown on to the houses. Again we cross a stream that flow's down a little ravine right into Clovelly. We pass down on the other side of this ravine. Now our path rounds the back of the town, lying"], [140, "126 NORTH DEVON. from our point of view embowered on the hill, the blue sea seen bejond in all its loveliness through the green interstices of the trees. At the end of the road continuing the Hobby Drive towards Clovelly (the New Road is the name given to the last mile), a turn to the right leads us on to a spot whence we get a most charming peep of the cliff along which our path has been cut. But pursuing our road towards the romantic little town, we come into its High-street, and begin to explore this singular place, the site of which has been cut out from the steep hill-side. First, the street goes straight down by a series of paved steps. Then it winds and winds down to the beach, the houses being placed one over the other, each with its bit of garden railed off. The houses seem to adhere as by an effort to the wooded hill-side \u2014 a hill which is in fact so steep that it may be called a cliff. Let us begin our exploration of this singular place from the beach. Around the quay at Clovelly and opposite the small breakwater which is built up to enclose its tiny harbour, small houses cluster, built on rocky foundations which are daily washed by the tide. These houses are curiously arranged, some of them with wooden balconies, erected probably to keep children from tumbling out on to the beach. Turning away from the beach in commencing our ascent through the heart of Clovelly, hung on thc steep and wooded hill which rises over the sea, we enter, passing under an archway, the lower end of the High-street, corresponding to the bottom of the town. In doing this, we are actually passing under the foundations of a house which has been built on the archway in question."], [141, "NORTH DEVON. 127 And now we commence the singular ascent to ' the top of the town.' To make this ascent as easy as possible for the pedestrian, the entire road through the heart of Clovelly is not only paved with rounded stones like very big pebbles, but the whole of the way is divided into broad steps, each some what the shape of a parallelogram, and rising two or three inches above the next below it \u2014 the division where the upper steps rise above the lower being marked by a line of larger stones. The crevices between the stones are filled with small tufts of grass, and at the end of each division below the line marked by the big stones are larger tufts of grass and weeds. Grass, too, grows along the way at the foot of the walls of the houses which are some of brick and others of stone, and some composed partty of brick and partly of stone. Some of the houses are perched over others, and are approached by winding-steps. Fern and grass fill the inter stices between the bricks and stone. Gardens are placed in odd corners in all sorts of spaces, which exist in all kinds of almost impossible situations; and where there is no room for gardens, little spaces at the foot of the walls are utilised, where fuchsias and creepers, snapdragons, geraniums and ivy grow. From the quay the road winds round and round in its first ascent. Some steps in almost every direction appear to lead everywhere, up into the houses which would, but for them, be impossible of approach, down into and up into gardens placed in marvellous corners, and away into pantries and out-houses. Now on the side of the High-street a wall parts off a small enclosure which does service for a garden. In other places such enclosures are filled with high and rank weeds. Now as our paved path winds on and up, we pass under a"], [142, "128 NORTH DEVON. wall built up of big stones ; and topping this wall above us and springing out over our path are long clumps of fuchsia and other garden flowers. As we wind upwards, we reach a point where our path opens up a view of the harbour and the sea beyond. At this spot, looking over the wall on our right in the direction of the sea, we catch sight of a tiny garden bright with hydrangia, sweet pea, nasturtium, and fuchsia. This garden is hung as it were over the wall, and is actually higher than the pointed slate roof of a house, which from where we stand has the appearance of clinging by its side to the cliff. We go on winding up and up. All at once, we hear the merry voices of children, appearing to come from high up in the air. Looking up to whence the voices proceed, and far above us, we see children playing in gardens that seem almost to hang over our head. A few minutes more and from the ledge where we stand, if we look across on our left, we espy a cottage giddily perched right on the top of a cliff covered with ivy and shrubbery. A little further on and a turning to the right leads into a sort of paved quadrangle, which is in fact a little world in itself, having little flights of steps leading up to and leading down into gardens placed in every imaginable position, the houses to which they are attached respectively being so placed as to command a view of several tiers of houses lying below them. Then after winding and turning in every possible way, we at length reach once more the steep and almost straight part of the High-street which leads away up to the top of the town.\""], [143, "NORTH DEVON 129 &f)r Corrioge.

Above the town the hills close in, cushioned with deep oak woods, through which juts here and there a crag of fern-fringed slate ; below they lower, and open more and more in softly rounded knolls, and fertile squares of red and green, till they sink into the wide expanse of hazy flats, rich salt marshes, and rolling sand-hills, where Torridge joins her sister Taw, and both together flow quietly toward the broad surges of the bar, and the everlasting thunder of the long Atlantic swell.

But all do not know the occult powers which have advanced and animated the said wondrous bridge for now 300 years, and made it the chief wonder, according to Prince and Fuller, of this fair land of Devon ; being first an inspired bridge ; a soul-saving bridge ; an alms-giving bridge ; an educational bridge ; a sentient bridge ; and last, but not least, a dinner -giving bridge. All do not know how, when it began to be built some half-mile higher up, hands invisible carried the stones down stream each night to the present site ; until Sir Richard Gurney, parson of the parish, going to bed one night in sore perplexity, and fear of the evil spirit who seemed so busy in his sheepfold, beheld a vision of an angel, who bade build the bridge where he himself had so kindly transported the materials : for there alone was sure founda tion amid the broad sheet of shifting sand. All do not know how Bishop Grandison of Exeter proclaimed through out his diocese indulgences, benedictions and ' participation in all spiritual blessings for ever,' to all who would promote the bridging of that dangerous ford; and so, consulting"], [148, "134 north Devon. alike the interests of their souls and of their bodies, 'make the best of both worlds.' \" All do not know, nor do I, that ' though the foundation of the bridge is laid upon wool, yet it shakes at the slightest step of a horse'; or that 'though it has 23 arches, yet one William Alford (another Milo) carried on his back, for a wager, four bushels salt-water measure, all the length thereof ' ; or that the bridge is a veritable esquire, bearing arms of its own (a ship and a bridge proper on a plain field), and owning lands and tenements in many parishes, with which the said miraculous bridge has from time to time founded charities, built schools, waged suits of law, and finally given yearly dinners, and kept for that purpose (luxurious and liquorish bridge that it was) the best stocked cellar of wines in all Devon.\" Braunton Burroojs. From Tlie North Devon Scenery Book, By George Tugwell, M.A. The Burrows are a great chaos of wind-strewn sand-hills, covering a tract of ground, say of two miles in length, and, from half to three-quarters of a mile in breadth, and forming a natural and most necessary barrier to the further inland incursions of the drifting sands. It is curious to notice the manner in which an impassable barricade is naturally formed out of such shifting and perishable materials as drifting sand and decayed vegetation. A hillock of white ever-moving sand is driven up by the wind \u2014 by and by a long creeping trailer of the tufted sand grass slides along from a neighbouring hillock, where the"], [149, "NORTH DEVON. 135 process is already in a forward state, \u2014 then another under ground-root shoots out in a straight line, and another, and another, till at last an interlacing mat of sturdy grass is constructed. Then a few rushes perhaps will spring up ; by and by the sword-like leaves of the lesser Iris, (whose grey blue blossoms and bright scarlet berries are so great an adornment of this and other like waste places) put in an appearance ; then more grass springs up, and more plants burst out into flower ; and so, in the end, the whole surface is covered with luxuriant many-hued vegetation, and a hairier is formed against which the stormy winds may rage in vain. The Burrows, waste and desolate as they seem to a careless observer, are in truth full of life and beauty. Countless troops of rabbits hurry in and out and round about in ceaseless motion ; overhead the pee-wit screams, the white gulls soar, the lark chants ; in the marshy pools the brown-winged water-beetle dives, the water-snails crawl, and swarms of grey-winged gnats and gayer ephemerid\u00e6 live out their brief and sunlit hours. Over the jagged leaves and yellow blooms of the Ragwort, the pretty pink-winged moth (Phal\u0153na Jacob\u0153a) is fluttering his bright colours. And the plants ! 0, brother botanist, go and visit the Burrows, and thank me for the harvest which I point out as a reward for your happy labours ! In this short summer afternoon I gathered more rare and beautiful specimens than I must here catalogue : amongst many others were the dull and livid blossom of the Henbane, the blue and crimson Viper's Bugloss, the woolly great Mullein. the pretty pink Centaury, the yellow Chlora, the delicate- Bog-pimpernel, the dull-purple Hound's-tongue, the square stemmed St. John's-wort, with which and divers others not"], [150, "136 NORTH DEVON. to be here recorded I filled my vasculum, and intend to enrich m}' home herbarium. And the views from those Burrows ! Over the white sands, all down the glittering reach of the brimming river my eye is wandering : now it rests on the winding water wasted curve of white Appledore : now it loses itself amid the leafy mazes of Northam, nestling among its fair green hills : now it catches the twinkling of the tossing flood on o o the wreck-sown Bar : now it rests on the far-off cliff outline where Clovelly sleeps in its wooded gorge, and great Harty Point keeps lonely watch amid the Atlantic surge. Yes \u2014 whatever you do in North Devonshire, go and \" do \" the Burrows : and if you pronounce them to be (as they are) \" a number of sand-hills in the neighbourhood of a marsh,\" it will be your own fault, and not mine \u2014 nor theirs.

Lulled by the tumult, oft, in thoughtful mood, On yonder rock how often have I stood, And breathed moist air, and wooed the briny shower, Absorbed, and reckless of the passing hour ; Nor moved until the tide, with deafening sound, Circled my narrowing station close around ; Then, as the exhausted wave forsook the strand, With foot elastic pressed the yielding sand ; And ere its force regathered, with a bound Gained the dry shore, and spurned the grassy ground. Thence with rude toil I climbed yon cliff's steep brow And viewed, enraptured, all the scene below, A vast expanse of heaving billows, crowned With trembling, snowlike foam, exulted round ; And 'neath my feet, between each watery vale, I marked the white-winged sea-gull slowly sail.

Towards the close of Spring, when the trees are in full leaf but still keep their delicate varieties of colour \u2014 varieties lost in the fulness of Summer, to be regained with even greater beauty in Autumn \u2014 at this time, when the furze is in all its golden glory, perpetually tempting one to pluck a tuft of blossoms as the largest specimen ever seen, and scenting the air all round, Ilfracombe is enchanting. So it is in Summer ; but the loss of the furze is almost like the fading away of the evening led. Contemporary with the furze is the lovely primrose, here seen to perfection, covering the hill-sides with pale stars, almost as plentifully as butter-cups and daisies elsewhere. In such a season, the walk to Lee seduces with its beauties of rocky coast and wooded inland hill ; or the woods of Chambercombe lure you into their coolness. When the sun is broiling in cloud- less blue, the coolness of a wood, in which the sunbeams only flicker through branches and elicit all their beauties, forms a pleasant retreat, and before you reach Chamber- combe the eye has been delighted with perpetual landscapes.

Close to the gate of this farmyard there is a spring which is a perfect miniature of some Swiss \" falls.\" It spreads itself like a crystal fan on successive ledges of the hedge-bank, until it reaches a much broader ledge, where it forms a little lake on a lied of brown pebbles ; then down it goes again till it reaches the road where it runs along a tiny, happy, babbling stream. One of the endless charms of these lanes \u2014 as of all mountainous districts \u2014 is the frequency of the springs, glossy with liverwort and feathery with fern, making a pleasant music day and night. Passing through the farmyard, where the pigs wallow, and grunt sensual satis-"], [155, "NORTH DEVON. 141 faction, and the cows look at you with bovine stupidity, you come upon a widening of the lane, where several gateways meet, and here the exquisite wild flowers, everywhere so abundant, seem more than ever luxuriant. What a perfect bit of foreground is that ! A few rough mossy trunks lying against the tufts of fern, and a quiet donkey stretched across the lane in \" maiden meditation, fancy free \" ; it is one of those exquisite nothings which somehow affect you more than a fine landscape. At least it so affected us ; and this was surpassed a little further on, when we came to a spot where a brook runs brawling across the lane, and a wooden bridge allows those to pass who prefer not wetting their feet. A rough hurdle is fixed up where the brook gushes from the field into the lane, over brown stones, which it polishes into agate. Against the little bridge rises a tree, and all round its roots by the brook-side are varied tufts of fern, and gems of wild-flowers. How I wished to be a painter that I might sketch such \" bits \" as these, and not let enthusiasm evaporate in oh's ! Another favourite walk was to Watermouth and Berry narbor, over the edges of majestic cliffs, revealing inlet after inlet, each differing in its wealth of colour, each a picture, till we passed into what are called the \" meadows,\" really a noble park, through which runs a stream fringed with wild flowers, and clear as crystal ; every twenty or thirty yards the stream falls over an artificial precipice of stones, making a dulcet music.

And yet, beautiful as that was, Lynmouth will ever live in my memory, not for that alone, or for that chief of all, but rather for that other Watersmeet down by the mur muring sea. It is now deep midnight, but I lie awake on this warm summer night with the full moon streaming in at my open window, and as I lie, so I listen. There is a great deal to be heard, as there always is, if one will only listen. I hear the quiet lapping of the sea among the slushing beach-pebbles, and its rolling swirl as it eddies about the angles of the weed-grown rocks : now a white owl hoots fitfully from about some far-off hill-barton : now a night-jar is clamouring in the hill-side woods ; now a stray footstep patters down the empty village street ; now a fisherman's boat grates slowly against the wet wood-work of the pier head ; now a sudden gusty wind rustles among the sleeping trees for an instant and is gone. But in all and above all and every sound is the sound of the merry brown Lyn. I hear the tinkling melody of its treble as its surface water is falling and falling in ten thousand tiny cascades and streamlets, the full rich harmony of its tenor and bass as the under-current rolls and gathers in the lower depths of its rocky bed.

The Lyn and the Brendon, sparkling diamond-like through the foliage, as they rush rapidly over their stony beds, unite their waters at a point called Waters'-meet, forming from thence the East Lyn ; which, after flowing for two miles through a deeply gorged and densely wooded combe of indescri- bable beauty, empties itself into the little harbour of Lynmouth. The West Lyn flows through another lovely valley, but running too swiftly to lose the race (the Lyns are a fast and dashing family) pours its waters into the latter stream, under a picturesque stone bridge beneath the houses of Lynmouth, just before entering the sea. Oh, take me to the watersmeet, In Devon's loveliest vale, Where Lynmouth's jewelled daughters meet \u2014 Twin sisters of the dale ;"], [170, "156 NORTH DEVON.

By Richard John King. From the Standard, September 4, 1874. In one of his romances, Hawthorne refers to the life of the flitting moment, existing in the antique shell of an age gone by, as having a fascination not to be found in either the past or present taken by themselves. It is a spell which, in these railroad days, not very often falls upon us even in an old country like our own. Nevertheless, a corner or too may still be found where not only the shell of former ages still survives, but where the very life seems to have been fossilized within it ; so that on entering such a district we find ourselves carried back all at once for two or three centuries. The charm is undoubtedly great for the time. It is like intruding on some happy valley where the hopes and anxieties of ordinary life are altogether unknown. Of course this is only seeming ; and after a short experience of its glamour, we begin to find that humanity in its antique shell is troubled by much the same disorders as humanity in its most modern habiliments, and we are contented to leave the valley to its own old-fashioned existence. But a glimpse into such a bygone world is full of"], [179, "SOUTH DEVON. 165 interest, and we know of no corner that more completely satisfies the conditions than a certain strip of the English coast stretching away westward for some miles from the little town of Axinouth on the extreme border of Dorset shire. There are certain peculiarities of the coast-line here which, as well as the unwillingness of proprietors to intro duce or to encounter change, have led to the comparative isolation of the district. It is greatly shut off from the land behind it. High ranges of hills, flanked here and there by single heights of much steepness, rise above the sea, and from them descend at intervals long narrow combes, each carrying its own streamlet. Sometimes, indeed most frequently, there is no pass over the hill from the head of the combe, so that from the sea the valley opens like a cleft, often broadening as it ascends, and occasionally spreading out on the upper hill-side in a cluster of hollows like the fingers of an open hand. The descent into these combes must always have been difficult. The roads are bad enough now, but in former days they could hardly have existed at all, and the tracks deep in mire can scarcely have been passable in winter. Yet almost every valley has its church, its group of cottages about it, and its farms and old squires' houses scattered through the more distant recesses. And the church is generally so ancient, showing portions which are at least Norman and may be older, as to prove that each valley received its settlement at a very early period. The seaboard itself, with a broken underclitf \u2014 for the chalk and the sandstone have been crumbling away for centuries \u2014 had always its own attractions ; but except the Cob at Lyme Regis, a very ancient work no doubt, and one which has been of infinite service, there is no place of shelter for a vessel between Portland on one side and the"], [180, "SOUTH DEVON. 166 mouth of the Exe on the other ; and landing on this rocky coast is difficult and sometimes dangerous. This, while it has helped, of course, to isolate the district, has also produced results and habits which have gone far to colour the life of it. It was often what Bacon calls Cornwall, with more injustice, a \"back door of rebellion.\" Secret messengers and bearers of mysterious tokens and packets arrived here and despatched from this little-watched coast, and the caves and cliff's which abound along it were long the haunt of the most daring company of smugglers to be found between the mouth of the Thames and John o' Groat's House. The head-quarters of the smugglers was the little cove of Beer, one of the. most picturesque hollows throughout the whole range of the western coast. Here the chalk, which extends across England in a south-westerly direction from Flainborough Head, terminates in a great headland, shattered into towers and peaks and pinnacles, and pierced below with broad-arched caves, through which the sea flows, filling them at high tide with strange colours and reflections. Higher up in the cliffs are other caverns, some of which have partly been fashioned by human handiwork. These are Jack Rattenbury's caves, and in them that famous smuggler\u2014 as well known in the west as Rob Roy round Loch Lomond \u2014 was wont to disport himself with his companions, and to stow away certain of his ventures. Certain solitary woods and plantations also are still pointed out as the favourite hiding places of the smugglers. All this has passed away ; but the village of Beer i3 as quaint and old-fashioned as ever. A streamlet dashes down the steep street, and falls over a cliff' at the end. Red capped fishermen lie sunning themselves on the rocks ; and changing lights, through which flocks of sea-birds Hash and"], [181, "SOUTH DEVON. 167 whirl, flit across the white glimmering headland. * * * Over the cliffs from Beer, with all the great Western Bay open before us, with Portland and the Start both visible at the horns of the bay, and with the. long range of Dartmoor stretching inland in the extreme distance, we pass on to the hollow of Branscombe \u2014 the most important and most interesting of the valleys that break the cliff' lino. On the heights there is but little furze and heather. The combe that is broken into at least three narrow valleys, each of which has its spurs and its tributary \" goyles \" \u2014 to use the local word \u2014 is tufted with thick wood, and green with bright crofts and meadows. To look down upon it from the edge of the overhanging hill is like looking into another region. You see the little clusters of houses that have gathered in the most sheltered spots. You mark the patches of coppice, and the old, far spreading trees that encircle the outlying, solitary dwellings, and towards the centre of the combe you distinguish the tower of the church, rising grey and massive, with a circular projecting turret, above the principal group of cottages. All round, the hills sweep projectingly, and seaward beyond the combe mouth, are broken into a strange outline, like a long entrenchment with an occasional baiTow \u2014 due in reality to abandoned chalk works which have been again covered with soft green turf. Before descending into the combe you see how secluded and how little changed it is. The little fields and pastures keep their ancient hedges, and the trees in them have not been pollarded. They spread their branches as they will ; and the banks of the stream, at least near the sea, are a tangle of wild plants and flowers ; some of them, as the larkspur and tlie great purple pea, not very often to be met with.

The name itself, as chosen by its early colonists, gives a free and comprehensive description of its scenery \u2014 Brans-Combe \u2014 two British words, whose modern equivalent would imply, the Croiu's dingle \u2014 and there is no better introduction to its attractions than a walk over the hill from the neighbouring village of Beer. As we gain the crest of the hill, which is a very high one, we look down at once into the place. Facing us first, and somewhat to the left, is the ever beautiful sea (wdiich to-day is intensely blue and calm), revealed in a sort of triangular peep, as the hill sides run down with sharp obliquity to almost a point at the bottom of the narrow, gorge-like valley, and meet at a strip of wdiite building, where a tall signal post and a dot of red bunting tell us Her Majesty's coast wTatchmen are domiciled. Directly in front, the cliff line is broken and jagged in a remarkable manner into huge plateaus and ravines, and"], [184, "170 SOUTH DEVON. looks like colossal fortifications raised by some past Cyclo pean race. At our feet, far below, is Branscombe proper \u2014 a series of deep, narrow, tortuous combes, convoluting round high coniformed hills of differing shape : \u2014 \u2022 \" Crags, knolls and mounds confusedly hurled, The fragments of an earlier world, And mountains that like giants stand To sentinel enchanted land.\" The villages forming the place are three in number \u2014 little nests of houses at the bottom of these valleys, half-a-mile apart, but connected together by the main road of the parish, which runs round the base of one of the hills, with a sort of esplanade appearance, well defined by strings of cottages skirting its margin at intervals. The first of these hamlets contains the parsonage, also a portion of an old manse, with tall gable and quaint gargoyles and the village \" public \" ; the second, the church and one or two antient farm-houses ; the third, the village smithy, the ubiquitous preaching-house of the disciples of Wesley, and sundry cottages. We must now descend from this elevated station, and our path zig-zags down the steep declivity through a copse of stunted trees and thick under-gro-wth. To our right rises a noble rocky hill at the base of which are the remains of an old unused lime quarry of large size, whose crater, scooped out of the side of the eminence, and serrated at the edges, gives it a sort of volcanic appearance.

Richard John King iu the Standard of August 22, 1874. The oldest watering-place on the Devonshire coast \u2014 yet, in one sense, the very newest \u2014 is Sidmouth. It was \" discovered \" by an occasional aristocratic visitor long before the end of last century. It has only within the last month or twTo been brought into contact with the world by means of a railway. At present Sidmouth is one of the pleasantest retreats on the southern coast. It is not fashionable. The marvellous toilettes of Trouville or of Dean ville would create on its esplanade at least as much wonder as admiration. As yet there has been no great"], [186, "172 SOUTH DEVON. accession of visitors, for there are no new lodging-houses or hotels, and the old supply was but scanty. To visit it is almost like passing back to the days when a journey to such a watering place was an event, when Torquay was a little more than a collection of fishermen's huts, and when King George used to dip himself in the sea at Weymouth whilst a military band stationed at becoming distance played \"God save the King \" as he took the first plunge from his \" bathing chariot.\" There are few modern villas or modern houses at Sidmouth. The old town (it is little more than a village), narrow streeted, with here and there a quaint gable or frontage, winds down the valley toward the sea, and opens on a wide esplanade, under which the. waves murmur or roar at their pleasure. There is no lack of sea breeze and sea spray ; but it is the beauty of the situation, the quiet, old-fashioned surrounding country, lovely with its broken hills and valleys, and shadowed with wood that, \u2022wherever the cliffs afford an opening, overhangs the very shore\u2014 it is this that gives especial character to Sidmouth, and distinguishes it even among its sister watering places \u2014 Season, Exmouth, Dawlish, Teignmouth. As to Torquay, she has long since become a sort of west country Brighton, and, beautiful as the whole neighbourhood may be, you have to walk through a forest of brick and mortar before you can get at the true greenwood, and further still if you desire to make an acquaintance wdth an untouched Devon shire lane. At Sidmouth every thing remains much as it was fifty years ago. The church has been rebuilt, not perhaps before it was needful, though certainly to the destruction of some ancient memorials ; but with this exception there is little sign of serious change. The place has all the appearance of being well cared for by its"], [187, "SOUTH DEVON. 173 permanent inhabitants, who perhaps feel little desire to see their quiet valley invaded by troops of summer visitors, who if they are to come in their usual numbers will necessarily change its appearance. The streets are admirably kept and cleaned. Field paths lead everywhere into the open country and to the beautiful cliffs that guard the bay, and there are plenty of seats at due intervals. The whole valley beyond the town is scattered with houses which are not of yesterday, as the old trees and enclosures about them sufficiently prove. Many of these houses may date from the time when Sidmouth first began to rise into notice as a sea side resort ; but they are one and all real homes, not places whose inhabitants change with every month, The equable climate \u2014 the average daily range of temperature is indeed less here than on any other part of the Devonshire coast \u2014 and its comparative dryness were duly felt and appreciated long ago, although it is of course only of late years that such subjects have been examined -with real knowledge. Some Devonshire families built winter villas here. Some wandering strangers, struck with the beauty of the country, the soft air, and the gardens full of hydrangeas, roses and myrtles, thought that a retreat among them would be the pleasantest change possible from the noises of town. One of the first of these was a Mr. Boehm, at whose house in St. James's Square, the Prince Regent was attending a grand ball, when the news of the Waterloo victory was brought to him, and three of the French eagles were laid at his feet in the midst of the ball-room by Henry Percy. Mr. Boehm built a house at Sidmouth, which was afterwards occupied by Bacon, the sculptor, and the lines which exist of his composing prove that the charms of Sidmouth were not lost on the Bacons ; \u2014"], [188, "SOUTH DEVON. 174 \" Mrs. Boehm wrote a poem On the Sidmouth air ; Mr. Boehm read the poem, And built a cottage there. Mr. Bacon all forsaken, Wandered to the spot ; Mrs. Bacon he has taken Partner of his lot ; As they longer live, the stronger Their affection grows, Every season they with reason Bless the spot they chose ! \" Sidmouth moreover, as we all know, was at this early time not without the occasional presence of Princes. The Duke of Kent occupied for some time a villa close to the sea belonging to General Baynes, and he died in this house in January, 1820. The villa \u2014 by no means one of the most attractive in the neighbourhood \u2014 stands at the end of a narrow green hollow, opening to the esplanade and the sea. It looks damp and dark, overshadowed as it is with trees ; but it has, and always must have, an especial interest above other houses in the place since it was the home of her Majesty the Queen, during some of the first years of her life. As a memorial of that time, and of the event which saddened her residence at Sidmouth, the western window of the rebuilt church has been filled with stained glass as a gift from the Queen. It was somewhat later that Sidmouth made an impression on the youthful mind of Thackeray, who in his Charterhouse days, between the years 1825 and 1828 used to spend his vacations at Larkbeare, in the parish of Ottery St. Mary, then occupied by his step-father Major Carmichael Smyth. There can be little doubt but that some memories of Ottery, of Exeter, and of Sidmouth, interwove themselves in the descriptions of \" Clavering St."], [189, "SOUTH DEVON. 175 Mary,\" the \"Chatteris,\" and the \"Baymouth\" of \"Pendennis\" although the scenic pictures in that novel, as in others by the same \" eminent hand,\" never impress us so vividly as the pictures of human life to which they form the back ground. It is doing no injustice to Thackeray, to say that he was more at home on the shady side of Pali-Mall, than on the breezy heights of \" Baymouth.\" One had all his sympathies ; the other he cared for only so far as the heath or the shore were speckled with human figures. But that shore \u2014 the shore of Sidmouth \u2014 is one to delight a poet or a poet painter. The Great Western Bay, as it is called \u2014 that vast indentation of the coast which extends from the Bill of Portland to Berry Head \u2014 -is here at its deepest point, indented yet more deeply, so that a consider able portion of the shores of the main bay is hidden from the beach at Sidmouth. The Great Bay, it has been suggest ed, may have been hollowed by the action of the Gulf Stream, which divides at the Land's End ; part of the current passing westward, another portion up the Channel and curving round the bay. The stream indeed, has never borne tropical fruits and woods to the beach at Sidmouth, as it has sometimes carried them to the shores of the Orkneys ; but the equable climate of the place, no less than the rich growth of the cliff sides and the valleys, are possibly due to it. All manner of green things \u2014 furze, heath, holly, streamers of honey suckle, and thickets of \"traveller's joy,\" cluster at the very edge of the cliffs, and wherever the rock has fallen in landslips, descend and occupy it as their own property. The colouring of the whole coast is varied, with the cliffs of Beer Head, the most southernly extremity of the chalk in England, projecting whitely at one end, whilst intervening heights exchange pale green"], [190, "176 SOUTH DEVON. sand, capped with yellow clay, for the dull red of the sandstone, until the High Peak sends its long spined outline toward the sea, with a single inaccessible pinnacle of rock isolated beyond it. Between the spines, and in the hollows of the High Peak, tufts and thickets of green plants have established themselves, in fine contrast with the red of the cliff, which has been called the most beautiful, as the Prawle is the grandest on the Devonshire coast. The beauty of outline is great, but the High Peak is even more indebted to its wonderful variety of colour \u2014 colour that changes with every mood of the sky and with every hour of the day. Half veiled with mist, through which the sea birds float and wheel, sparkling in sunlight, or resting half in shadow, with the bluest of seas stretching far away from its point, there is no limit to its changeful \" shows \" and the eye is never tired of watching them. There is considerable resemblance between the climate of this part of the Devonshire coast, and that of St. David's, in South Wales\u2014 with the exception of the Land's End the most westerly promontory of Britain. In both cases, the equable temperature and the absence of severe winters seem to have been some kind of inducement (they are advantages, it must be remembered, which would certainly not be over looked by half-civilised tribes at present) at very early periods to the settlements of wandering races, who gradu ally spread themselves over the country. The Welsh coast abounds in \" Cliff Castles,\" and in more inland strongholds. This part of Devonshire was, as careful exploration has shown, thickly peopled during the Bronze Age \u2014 a time of unknown and scarcely (as yet) measurable antiquity, to which however the hill forts and barrows scattered all over the country have been referred by competent arch\u00e6ologists."], [191, "SOUTH DEVON. 177 The country, as seen from any of the heights which command it, is as naturally formed for camps and hill forts as Dorsetshire itself. The red sandstone runs out into long ridges with deep spurs and buttresses, and rises in isolated hills commanding the many valleys that open round their bases. On one of these hills, a mile or two up the little stream of the Sid, is what we may regard as the parent settlement of the valley \u2014 the hill-fort of Sidbury. This is a large and strong camp, nearly oval, with a double rampart 40 feet high. From its area you look in one direction upon a maze of winding coombes and ravines, and in another down the richly wooded valley to the patch of blue sea at its mouth. It may have been the fortress successively of those unknown tribes whose bronze hatchets and daggers have been found in the tumuli about it \u2014 of Britons and Saxons, until the latter, as the world around them became somewhat less wild, deserted the hill-top for the valley, and raised the little church of Sidbury near the stream below. Here was the second settlement. The church as it now stands can show nothing more ancient than the Conquest, but it has some quaint Norman work, and rises picturesquely from the hamlet that nestles round it. Long after the bells of Sidbury had first sounded through the valley, colonists crept downwards towards the sea, and the third settlement was founded at the mouth of the Sid. This is the story we can read plainly enough from the broken ramparts of the \" Bury,\" which overlooks the -whole country. N"], [192, "178 SOUTH DEVON. Sonnet to the Ei&er \u00a9ttcr.

Uofon the \u00a9art. From Rambles in Devonshire by the Rev. H. J. Whitfeld, M.A., 1854. Sailing in a boat down the Dart on a fine day is a very pleasant affair. There is not the grandeur of the Rhone, nor the legendary beauty of the Rhine, but perhaps you enjoy it quite as much. It is only the Dart, after all, coming clown gently from its native tors, and winding here and there, with a wood on one side, and on the other a ruin, and then a current that might almost be termed rapid, and then again a broad silver bay, and at last, to your surprise, a seaport and the sea, and an end to your quiet voyage. Still it has no lack of objects on its banks to interest and to charm. There is that fine old mansion, Dartington Hall with its memories of the Duke of Exeter, and of the Champernounes, its present possessors. There is Dartington Parsonage, linked with a name known to every Churchman the name of Froude. There is Berry Pomeroy with a host"], [220, "SOUTH DEVON. 206 of traditions ; and the old keep of Joel de Totnes ; and Sharpham, reminding me of a dear place which I shall never see again ; and Stoke Gabriel, nestling in its little amphitheatre of slope and wood ; and Sandridge ; and Waddeton Court, showing its Elizabethan outlines well upon the hill ; and Dittisham ; and Greenaway ; and the rock in the stream upon which Raleigh is said to have smoked his first pipe ; and then the oak groves of Lupton House ; and then Dartmouth. All these are peaceful beauties, but they are such as one does not often see compressed in so small a compass. There you have in succession wood, and ruin, and hill, and between all, the Great Deep. It would, I think, be difficult to find an additional charm, or to say where one is wanting in the list. Gliding down, gliding down, Gliding down the stream, Like an old familiar tune, Like a quiet dream, Every whisper breathes a song, Bright is every beam, As we muse, and float along Gliding down the stream. Holy light, o'er earth and sky, Hovereth ever near, And a voice from days gone by Answereth to the ear, Telling us of those who thus Basked in pleasure's beam, Those who passed away like us Gliding down the stream."], [221, "SOUTH DEVON. 207 We are on a quest as gay, Ours are smiles as fond, They have left the bright to-day For the Deep beyond, They have closed their pilgrimage, And to us they seem Guides along the unknown Dark Gliding down the stream. And then we come upon Dartmouth, and a pretty panorama it is. The town lies in a not ungraceful cluster, on the right, below Mount Boone. Facing us is Kingswear, and beyond is Brookhill, and the Beacon, and opposite to them Clifton Castle, and St. Petrox Church. And between their shores, amid scenes as beautiful as ever eye beheld, or mind conceived, the Dart is lost upon the bosom of the deep broad sea, never seeming so fair as when it is bidding you farewell. 33ucKfast ahheu. Richard John King. Buckfast had been at first a Benedictine Abbey, but when it was resounded by Ethelwerd de Pomeroy in 11,17, it received, like Ford, a colony of Cistercians from Waverley. From the high ground above Buckfast, the castle of the Pomeroys on its_ scarped rock in the midst of thick woods is visible in the far distance. The site of Buckfast itself was far more fitting for the quiet-seeking, hard-labouring white monks than for the Benedictines ; and of all the Devonshire Monasteries it most recalls the wild and picturesque positions of the great Yorkshire houses. It"], [222, "208 SOUTH DEVON. stood \u2014 its scanty ruins yet stand \u2014 on the right bank of the Dart, where the river winds under a steep wooded hill, and leaves a broad stretch of green meadow between itself and the much steeper hills that rise, crest on crest, towards the open moorland. The river is here in the middle portion of its course ; between the wilder scenes where it sparkles and dashes among the huge masses of broken granite under Benjie Tor and the woods of Buckland, and the more cultivated and richer, but hardly lest striking country through which it passes below Staverton and Totnes. Above the site of the Abbey and beyond the meadows, tufted with patches of coppice and still known as the \" Monks' Walk,\" oak woods and coppices of birch close in the stream on either side ; and far away over the wide, wooded landscape, the rocky peaks of Dartmoor rise grey in the distance. Nothing can well be imagined more truly monastic, more full of quiet, peace, and seclusion, than the whole of this valley in the earlier days of the Cistercian house, when the white monks were still workers, and the life of the Convent was still true to its rule. The great church, whose ruins at the end of the last century, in the words of a Devonshire historian, \" moved all beholders to wonder and pity,\" rose, the centre and protection of the whole monastery. Round it were grouped the various buildings of such a house : the cloister of the monks, the abbot's lodging, the various guest chambers \"and the outer offices ; the great barns also or spicaria, of which one noble example still remains and which were especially prominent in the establishments of the agricultural Cistercians. The meadows lay green and sunny round the monastery.

The ruins of the church were used early in the century for building a factory ; and on the site of the abbot's house has arisen a modern Abbey of very different character from that known by the Cistercians. But the valley and the meadows are little changed ; and we may still mark the green sward of the \" Abbot's Way,\" \u2014 a track so called that winds over the moors, between the fern and the heather, from Holne Lee to Brent, \u2014 both of which manors belonged to the Abbey. These moors, lying outside the ring of the Roj'al Forest, were the Cistercian sheep tracts ; answering here to the wide fells and mountain pastures over which ranged the flocks belonging to Fountains or to Rievaulx. \u00a9n 'Ml: & Sonnet. \u25a0 From South Devon Songs and Sonnets.

From The Fern World, by Francis George Heath. 7th Ed. London, Sampson Low & Co., 1882. \" Amongst the boldest and grandest of the coast scenery of Devon is the wild, uninhabited, and we may really say almost unknown region which extends from Portlemouth to Prawle Point, the southernmost extremity of the county. To reach Portlemouth we took a cross-country course from Torcross, mounting the steep hill behind it and then pro ceeding along the high table-land to South Poole. It was late in the afternoon when we left the Torcross Hotel, and we had gone but a little distance when the last faint glimmer of day sank behind the hills. For miles we pursued our way in the darkness, lighted only by the faint glitter of the stars. But the depth of the shadows which fell upon our path was relieved here and there by the lights of the glow-worms which crept forth in their mimic brilliance along thc bushes on both sides of the road. Wearily we approached our journey's end for that day at South Poole, in whose little inn we passed the night. The sun shone out brilliantly, as early the next morning we took our way along the picturesque bank of the Kings bridge Water, on the opposite side of which we soon sighted Salcombe. Skirting the higher edge of Portle mouth, we made over the point of coast which commences"], [225, "SOUTH DEVON. 211 the line from Kingsbridge Creek to Prawle Point. Calling to get a draught of milk at a farmhouse on our line of route, we passed through a kind of water-lane, the stony sides of which were in places absolutely crowded with plants of the beautiful Asplenium lanceolatwn. Thence across some fields we made for the terrific but beautiful coast, iu search of Asplenium Marinum, which we had been assured grew in splendid luxuriance along the sheltered rocks in this neighbourhood. We were not long in reaching the top of a steep inlet of the sea. But the cliffs reared up almost perpendicularly, and appeared to forbid the possibility of access to the wild beach which lay far down below. With some difficulty, however, and at some risk we clambered down the rocky sides of the solitary chasm, and made our way on to the rugged beach which was wildly strewn with great masses of rock, over which the boiling waters of the sea broke in fury. We had indeed reached the home of the Sea Fern ; for on the first glance around we espied under the moist shelter of a great mass of rock just over our head, a splendid specimen of Marinum with fronds fully twelve inches long, hanging down in a great and shining mass of purple stem and leafy glossy green. For some distance we made our way along this terrible but beautiful shore, terrible to the hapless bark which might be flung on to it in the wild rage of a south-westerly gale, but beautiful to those who love to see Nature in her grandest aspects. Above, steep, jagged, precipitous cliffs ; below, fallen rocks of every form and shape, strewn wildly upon the savage beach, and meeting sternly and immoveably the heavy roll of the sea, which comes in with a sullen roar, and is broken into a dozen reverberations as wave after Pa"], [226, "212 SOUTH DEVON. wave finds its way in amongst the rocky masses of the fore shore. Now against a solid front of rock the incoming wave comes with a swinging crash, and the liquid missile hurled against the stony surface flies far into the air in ten thousand points of snow-white foam. Now there is a dull roar followed by a succession of mournful echoes as a great wave rolls into a cavernous hollow in the cliff'. In one of these, where the incoming waves sped through a huge channel \u2014 formed between two great masses of almost per pendicular rock \u2014 we espied growing beyond the tide mark, but just within reach of the finest spray of the waves, a noble specimen of Marinum, its roots imbedded in the veins of rock, and its fronds hanging down as if to meet the fresh onset of the sea. But we encountered in all directions abundance of these beautiful plants, sometimes perched boldly on a cleft of rock which lay under the shelter of a larger rock above, sometimes ensconced in the hollows formed by two masses of superincumbent rock, and some times clinging to the side of the open cliff' in places where trickling moisture came oozing down from the height above. Presently we found that our progress along this rugged beach was no longer possible, for giant masses of rock lay right in our path, too precipitous to climb, and too steep to round on the seaward side. We therefore once more sought the high ground over the hill-top, along which the coast guard path took us for a considerable distance. A hill rose above us on our left like a great ridge, its side and top presenting a peculiarly wild appearance, strewn in some places as they were by gieat masses of contorted rock, whilst in others the surface of the ground was covered by waving bracken, purple heather, and golden gorse. Here we found in gieat abundance many fine plants of Asplenium"], [227, "SOUTH DEVON. 213 Lanveolatuii , ensconced under the shady projections of the hill-side rocks. In places where a mass of rock was piled up in a conglomerate heap, forming a variety of dark, moist, and shady recesses, these beautiful Ferns would be found growing in the greatest luxuriance, their pinnules having the peculiar crisped or curled appearance which is charac teristic of Lanceolatum. But perhaps the most beautiful part of this singularly wild and beautiful coast was that which lay between the coast we have just described and Prawle Point. We marvelled indeed that the railway which so quickly opens up thc most beautiful parts of our beautiful island had not long since been brought to this charming part of the coast of Devon. We passed a succession of the most lovely bays, which would make the most delightful of seaside retreats ; now fronted by strips of golden sand, as smooth as velvet to the touch ; now by a stretch of snow-white pebbles ; now by shingle of varying hue. Studded along the foreshore and partly covered by the sea were scattered about great masses of rock on which the sea-fowl perched, and around which the waves foamed and boiled. In places the tiny strips of beach were unapproachable from the cliff-top, which rose sheer above them to a vast height. At one particular spot to which we were led by following the coastguard path, we stood for a few moments, and gazed down a terrible precipice which suddenly yawned away below us. It was formed by two projecting point of cliff's, which spread out in horseshoe shape, approaching each other at their seaward extremity, and forming what might be almost likened to a huge well in their rear. Terrible indeed was this chasm, the jagged walls of which, down far, far belowr, appeared covered in places with a film of green which we knew must lie thc"], [228, "214 SOUTH DEVON. wild rough grass which is so often seen growing on sandy soil. Looking down the giddy height, we espied across and below on a glittering point of rock what looked like a small white stone. As we looked, however, the object appeared to move, and then by the aid of a glass we found that it was a sheep grazing on the cliff-side. The white gulls skimming in mid-air below us looked like butterflies, and down farther still the sea, whose roar we could not hear, except in a faint sigh, showed its fringe of snowy foam, as it broke upon the desolate rocks and spread itself over the golden sand. It is probably due to the ruggedness of many parts of this wild coast that the beautiful Sea Spleenwort flourishes there in such luxuriance. The shady clefts of rock and dripping caves, though offering a congenial home to this Fern, are too difficult, though not impossible, of access to admit of many visits from any except the most enthusiastic of Fern hunters. A week might well be spent in an exploration of the two or three miles of coast between Portlemouth and Prawde Point, and the Fern gatherer would find a world of pleasure in examining the charming nooks of that home of the Sea Fern.\" Pumouth, From Sonnets, by Rev.

A rough track leads from West Down to a retired nook, where, sheltered by the overhanging heights, is the con fluence of the Tavy and the Walkham. Two gentle rivers are they in this favoured spot. The Tavy glides around a promontory of great sylvan loveliness, and flows softly onward to meet its murmuring tributary. The peculiar beauty of this confluence gave rise to the following poem : The meeting of the waters With murmurs low and sweet ! Like beauty's modest daughters When first they kindly greet. The mountain o'er them bending, The bank of radiant flowers, To each a shadow lending, Unite their magic powers. The bird above them winging O O His flight to realms of day, In liquid measure singing, Repeats their soothing lay.

The marshes are so numerous that even the sheep and cattle desert the spot, and seek pasturage elsewhere. The form of man is seldom seen. A wild colt with tossing mane may sometimes cross our path, and gaze with wonder at the intruders on his domain. Otherwise no living creature but ourselves seems to tread the dreary waste. The solitude is as perfect as if we were in the deserts of Africa, instead of in the immediate neighbourhood of a civilised country. I never felt silence more than when I first visited the Cleaves ; for not even a bird raised its small note to break the stillness. All was quiet until a raven sprang from some distant quarter, where it had probably been making a carrion meal, and with its melancholy \" roke, roke,\" sailed across the valley, and was lost in the distance.

The sun sent an occasional ray through the lurid veil, rendering the dark ness more visible, and throwing a flickering and uncertain light over the frowning tors and gloomy valleys. However, this threatening aspect but heightened the grandeur of the scene ; and we went on our way impressed with awe and delight, and really enjoying the prospect of a storm. A wall of rocks forms a natural barrier to the Cleaves ; this is of granite, and seems justly fitted to be the bulwark of a world. A mighty portal opens to the view a deep sunk and wide-spread vale broken by small clefts or cleaves, by which the Tavy rushes with all the wild fury of a mountain stream. Masses of stone, tinted with red and yellow lichen, give to the hollow the appearance of a ruined town or city. At our feet a Druidical temple, with its cromlech or altar, seems to have been hurled from the heights on which we stand. Nature in her wildest frolics appears to figure forth the elaborate works of Art. In these fantastic groups of stones hurled together in motley confusion, we may imagine the ruins of an ancient Baalbec or Palmyra. \" But the masses of granite are so enormous,\" says Reason, that no effort of human power could have brought them together. \" There were giants in those days,\" we answer, and the idea of a ruined city again returns. Descending by the pre cipitous wTall which bounds Tavy Cleaves we gaze upwards on the scene, and still it wears new forms of grandeur.
