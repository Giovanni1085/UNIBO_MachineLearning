P. Harrington. Composed by Geo. Le Brunn. Words and Music published by Francis, Day, & Hunter, 195, Oxford Street, London, W. I'm just about the idlest coon that ever shook a leg \u2014 Too idle for to work and too idle for to beg \u2014 I always love to slouch about from morning until dusk, And pick up all the kernels while the workers get the husk. When I'm kind of thirsty, to the nearest pub, Amongst a crowd of other coons then I my shoulders rub; It's \" Howde do ?\" and \" How are you ?\" \u2014 of drinks I've three or four But when the paying part comes round I get close to the door. Chorus. I'm an I-D-L-E-R \u2014 I am an idler, I'm an IDLER ! I can take a drink all gay, But when it comes my turn to pay, I'm an I-D-L-E-R. An awful saucy coon I am in any sort of row, I talk a lot of fight, though to fight I don't know how, I get in lots of arguments, and lots of trouble too, Just like an idle nigger that's got nothing else to do. Now and then, my gracious ! when it comes to blows, I've a pumpkin on my eye and melons on my nose ; And if a coon lets out too soon and puts me on the ground, And says, \" Now then, get up, old chap, and have another round \" \u2014 Chorus. I'm an I-D-L-E-R \u2014 I am an idler, I'm an IDLER ! If he puts me on the floor And says\u2014\" Get up and have some more,' I'm an I-D-L-E-R. I once was nearly married, as nearly as could be \u2014 A lovely pretty girl threw her blinkers on to me \u2014 She was sweet \u2014 yes, extra sweet \u2014 a pearl beyond all price, And wore a satin dress that was particularly nice. Perhaps I would have spliced her, but, the day before, She dropped her glass eye. you know, just outside our street door ; And when I heard that other parts of her were false also, I stopped a few yards off the church and said, \" What ! me? oh no ! \" Chorus. I'm an I-D-L-E-R \u2014 I am an idler, I'm an I-D-L-E-R! Off to church I'd gladly waltz, But if from top to toe she's false. I'm an I-D-L-E-R,<?-,T' ?,y"], [11, "7 THE TIPPERARY COON.

We called upon McCarthy, and I told him that his daughter Was completely gone upon this coon ; I told him that the wedding ring and trousseau I had bought her \u2014 Then he grabbed his stick and faced this coon. He emptied first his whisky flask, Said, \" Why the divil, may I ask, Don't you remove that ugly mask \u2014 you brute !\" But when I told him 'twas my face. Said he, \" Oh !

He ain't no cause to boast and prate how he can lub a gal, He's just a silly ordinary individual ; No better and no worser than the other human kind, But Cupid's most promisc'ous, and the brat is always blind.

He says, while eating rice, I up and told him he was nice \u2014 But not at all \u2014 he ought to know I spoke about the rice ; I shouldn't tell him things like that as long as I may live, For the spirit of contrary is a gal's prerogative ! He says my eyes, like any book, speak volumes when I need, But when I like the book's a foreign language he can't read ; And he saw my eyes a-glistening, but such things he shouldn't note, For you can't help tears a-coming when a lump sticks in your thioat, Chorus. \u2014 Although I lub that coon, &c. Oh ! I've flirted with the other boys, the niggers and the coons, I've led them all a monkey dance like any big baboons ; I've seen that coon a-looking on, and not a word he said, Though his eyes were like a reservoir and heart a lump of lead. He says he knows the way a girl should be loved, and he crows, But I reckon this here child has taught him well nigh all he knows And though I flirt and tease him, oh ! soon over is my whim, For that coon is best of all. and so I soon go back to him.

I'se bound to snare another, When a likely coon I see ; I'se sure to grab his elbow, Sayin', \" Man, you b'long to me ! \" Before the reverend person, Right soon you'll see him switched ; And I'll say, \"Lord parson, look !

I've met in my time some very funny fellows, But the funniest of all I know Is a colour'd individual \u2014 as sure as you're alive, He's as black as any black crow. You may talk until you're tired, but you'll never get a word From this very funny queer old coon : He's a knock-kneed, double-jointed, hunky-plunky moke, But he's happy when he whistles this tune: \u2014 (Whistle.) He's got a pair of lips like a pound of liver split, And a nose like an injun-rubber shoe ; He's a limpy, happy, chuckle-headed, huckleberry nig, And he whistles like a happy killy-loo : He's an independent, free-and-easy, fat and greasy ham, With a cranium like a big baboon \u2014 I never heard him talk to anybody in my life, But he's happy when be whistles this tune : \u2014 (Whistle.) He'll whistle in the morning, through the day and through the night. He'll whistle to the children in bed, He'll whistle like a locomotive engine in his sleep, He'll whistle and stand on his head. One day a fellow hit him with a brick in the mouth, His face swelled like a balloon \u2014 Now he goes around shaking like a monkey in a fit, And this is how he whistles that tune : \u2014 (He cannot whistle any more, or scarcely.)"], [20, "16 I LUB A LUBLY GAL, I DO! t Written and Compoied by Brandon Thomas.

For you are the girl that has won my heart, With your lovely face and figure, You've been and stole all the mortal soul And senses of this nigger. I'm jealous lest I should lose you, when Down town you are parading ; To gain your smile once in a while, That's why I'm serenading. Do you remember the night we met ? Topsy mine ! I fancy that I see you yet, Your face so sweet, your tiny feet, And the frock just lifted from off the field ; You were shy as you passed me by, When I spoke, you turned away a laughing eye ; And for a week you would not speak, Till at last you found you had to yield. Then your Dad (wasn't he mad ?) Walked around us, when he found us ! Up I stand, I demand That he give me your little hand.

Written and Composed by Joseph Tabrar. Words and Music published by Hopwood & Crew, 42, New Bond Street, London, W. I love a little yaller gal, her name's Susanna, By her manner you d take her for a bird \u2014 She whistles, and it sounds just like an old pianner, Such a row you never ever heard. Talk about a-playing on an old tin whistle, With a thistle sticking in your nose, If any whistle takes the cake, then I'll bet this will \u2014 Well, just imagine this is how she blows : \u2014 ( Whistle). Susanna's like a fellow blowing down a trumpet, Like or lump it, she won't go away ; With a face that looks just like an underdone crumpet, Susie keeps a-blowing all the day. Whistling in the dark one night she blew her lip off, And the tip off of her flattined nose, From a little dimple too she blew a chip off \u2014 Well, just imagine this is how she blows: \u2014 (Whistle.) \"When Susie goes to bed at night she blows the clothes off, That is, those off which are not tucked in ; Perhaps yon won't believe it, once she blew two toes off, And now she keeps them in a lobster tin. Some one sewed her mouth up, and a lot he earnt too, But she learnt to whistle through her nose, Till one day the house caught fire, her nose got burnt too, And since that time this is how she blows : \u2014 ( Whistle. )"], [28, "THE Pftltflf t^yfevURftv trUUlI \u00a7> UBarn Stance.
