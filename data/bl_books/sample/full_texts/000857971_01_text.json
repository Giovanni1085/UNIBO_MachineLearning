Dana, immediately after the publication of the fifth edition of the System of Mineralogy. The state of his health, however, early compelled him to relinquish the work, and he was not able subsequently to resume it. Finally, after the lapse of seven years, the editorship of the volume was placed in the hands of the writer, Avho has endeavored to carry out the original plan. The work is intended to meet the requirements of class instruction. With this end in view the Descriptive part has been made subordinate to the more important, subjects embraced under Physical Mineralogy. The Crystallography is presented after the methods of Naumann ; his system being most easily understood by the beginner, and most convenient for giving a general knowledge of the principles of the Science. For use iu calculations, however, it is much less satisfactory than the method of Miller, and a concise exposition of Miller's System has accordingly been added in the Appendix. The chapter on the Physical Characters of Min erals has been expanded to a considerable length, but not more than was absolutely necessary in order to make clearly intelligible the methods of using the principles in the practical study of crystals. For a still fuller discussion of these subjects reference may be made to the works of Schrauf and of Groth, and for details in regard to the optical characters of mineral species to the Mineralogy of M. DesCloizeaux.

Unlike a plant or animal, an inorganic spe cies is a simple chemical compound, possessing unity of chemical and physi cal nature throughout, and alike in essential characters through all diversity \u201e . \u00b0 \u00b0 J of age or size. The Science of Mineralogy treats of those inorganic species which occur ready formed in or about the earth. It is therefore but a fragment of the Science of Inorganic nature, and it owes its separate consideration simply to convenience. The Inorganic Compounds are formed by the same forces, and on the same principles, whether produced in the laboratory of the chemist or in outdoor nature, and are strictly no more artificial in one case than in the other. ' Calcium carbonate of the chemical laboratory is in every character the same identical substance with calcium carbonate, or calcite, found in the rocks, and in each case is evolved by nature's operations. There is hence nothing whatever in the character of mineral species that entitles them to constitute a separate division in the natural classification of Inorganic species. Tlrte objects of Mineralogy proper are three-fold : 1, to present the true idea of each species ; 2, to exhibit the means and methods of distinguishing species, which object is however partly accomplished in the former ; 3, to make known the modes of occurrence and associations of species, and their geographical distribution. In presenting the science in this Text Book, the following order is adopted : I. Physical Mineralogy, comprising that elementary discussion with regard to the structure and form, and the physical qualities essential to a right understanding of mineral species, and their distinctions. II. Chemical and Determinative Mineralogy, presenting brief! v the general characters of species considered as chemical compounds, also giving the special methods of distinguishing species, and tables constructed for this purpose. The latter subject is preceded by a few words on the use of the blow-pipe. III. Descriptive Mineralogy, comprising the classification and descrip tions of species and their varieties. The descriptions include the physical and chemical properties of the most common and important of the minerals."], [16, "INTRODUCTION. VIII with some account also of their association and geographical distribution . The rarer species, and those of uncertain composition, are only very briefly noticed. Besides the above, there is also the department of Economic Mineralogy, which is not here included. It treats of the uses of minerals, (1) as ores ; (2) in jewelry ; and (3) m the coarser The following subjects connected with minerals properly pertain to Geology : 1, Litholo gical geology, or Lithologij, which treats of minerals as constituents of rocks. 2, Chemical geology, which considers in one of its subdivisions the origin of minerals, as determined, in the light of chemistry, by the associations of species, the alterations which species are liable to, or which they are known to have undergone, and the general nature, origin, and changes of the earth's rock formations. Under chemical geology, the department which considers especially the associations of species, and the order of succession in such associations has received the special name of the paragenesis of minerals ; while the origin of minerals or rocks through alteration, is called metamorphism or pseudomorphism, the latter term being restricted to those cases in which the crystalline form, and sometimes also the cleavage, of a mineral is retained after the change.

Structure. \u2014 Structure in Inorganic nature is a result of mathemati cal symmetry in the action of cohesive attraction. The forms produced are regular solids called crystals ; whence morphology is, in the Inorganic kingdom, called crystallology. It is the science of structure in this king dom of nature. 2. Physical properties of Minerals, or those depending on relations to light, heat, electricity, magnetism ; on differences as to density or specific gravity, hardness, taste, odor, etc. Crystallology is naturally divided into, I. Crystallography, which treats of the forms resulting from crystallization; II. Crystallogeny, which de scribes the methods of making crystals, and discusses the theories of their origin. Only the former of these two subjects is treated of in this work. SECTION I. CR YST ALLO GR APH Y. Crystallography embraces the consideration of \u2014 (1) normally formed or regular crystals ; (2) twin or compound crystals ; (3) the irregularities of crystals ; (4) crystalline aggregates ; and (5) pseudomorphous crystals. 1. General Characters of Crystals. (1) External form. \u2014 Crystals are bounded by plane surfaces, called simply planes or faces, symmetrically arranged in refer ence to one or more diametral lines called axes. In the an nexed figure the planes 1 and the planes i are symmetrically arranged with reference to the vertical axis c c / and also the planes of each kind with reference to the three transverse axes. (2) Constancy of angle in the same species. \u2014 The crystals of any species are essentially constant in the angle of inclination between like planes. The angle between 1 and ., in a given l species, is always essentially the same, wherever the crystal is found, and whether a product of nature or of the laboratory."], [20, "2 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. (3) Difference of angle of different species.\u2014 The crystals of different species commonly differ in angles between corresponding planes. The angles of crystals are consequently a means of distinguishing species. (4) Diversity of planes. \u2014 While in the crystals of a given species there is constancy of angle between like planes, the forms of the crystals may be exceedingly diverse. The accompanying figures are examples of a few of the forms of the species zircon.' There is hardly any limit to the number of forms which may occur ; yet for each the angles between like planes are essentially constant. Crystals occur of all sizes, from the merest microscopic point to a yard or more in diame ter. A single crystal of quartz, now at Milan, is three and a quarter feet long, and five and a half in circumference ; and its weight is estimated at eight hundred and seventy pounds. A single cavity in a vein of quartz near the Tiefen Glacier, in Switzerland, discovered in 1807, has afforded smoky quartz crystals weighing in the aggregate about 20,000 pounds ; a considerable number of the single crystals having a weight of 200 to 250 pounds, or even more. One of the gigantic beryls from Acworth. New Hampshire, measures four feet in length, and two and a half in circumference; and another, at Grafton, is over fourfeet long, and thirty-two inches in one of its diameters, and does not weigh less than two and a half tons. But the highest perfection of form and transparency are found only in crystals of small size. In its original signification the term crystal was applied only to crystals of quartz (f. 1), which the ancient philosophers believed to be water congealed by intense cold. Hence the term, from upvamWos, ice. (5) Symmetry in the position of planes. \u2014 The planes on the crystals of any species, however numerous, are arranged in accordance with certain laws of symmetry and numerical ratio. If one of the simpler forms be taken as a primary or fundamental form, all other planes will be secondary planes, or modifications of the fundamental form. It should be observed, however, that the forms called primary and fundamental in crystallographic \u25a0description, are in general merely so by assumption and for convenience of reference. (See also p. 12.) Cleavage. \u2014 Besides external symmetry of form, crystallization produces also regularity of internal structure, and often of fracture. This regular ity of fracture, or tendency to break or cleave along certain planes, is called cleavage. The surface afforded by cleavage is often smooth and brilliant. The directions of cleavage are those of least cohesive force in a crystal ; it"], [21, "3 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. is not to be understood that the cleavage lamell\u00e6 are in any sense present before the}7 are made to appear by fracture. In regard to cleavage, two principles may be here stated : \u2014 (a) In any species, the direction in which cleavage takes place is always parallel to some plane which either actually occurs in the crystals or may exist there in accordance with the general laws which will be stated hereafter. (_\u00bb) Cleavage is uniform as to ease parallel to all like planes ; that is, if it may be obtained parallel to one plane of a kind (as 1, f. 1), it may be ob tained with equal facility parallel to each of the other planes 1 ; and will afford planes of like lustre. This is in accordance with the symmetry of crystallization. It will be evident from this that the angles between planes of like cleavage will be constant : thus, a mass of calcite under the blow of a hammer will separate into countless rhombohedrons, each of which affords on measurement the angles 74\u00b0 55' and 105\u00b0 5'. In a shapeless mass of marble the minute grains have the same regularity of cleavage structure. See further, p. 115. 2. Descriptions of some of the simpler forms of Crystals. Preliminary Definitions. Angles. \u2014 In the descriptions of crystals three kinds of angles may come under consideration, solid, plane, and inters ti- dal. The last are the inclinations between the faces or planes of crystals. Axes. \u2014 The crystallographic axes are imaginary lines passing through the centre of a crystal. They are assumed as axes in order to describe, by reference to them, the relative positions of the different planes. One of the axes is called the vertical, and the others the lateral / the number of lateral axes is either two or three. The axes have essentially the same re- lative lengths in all the crystals of a species ; but those of different species often differ widely Diametral platies. \u2014 -The planes in which any two axes lie are called the a,xial or diametral planes or sections ; they are the coordinate planes of an- alytical geometry. They divide the space about the centre into sectants; into eight sectants, called octants, if there are but two lateral axes, as is generally the case ; but into twelve sectants if there are three, as in hexa- gonal crystalline forms. Diagonal planes are either diagonal to the three axes, as those through the centre connecting diagonally opposite solid angles of a cube, oi diag- onal to two axes, and passing through the third, as those connecting diag- onally opposite edges of the cube. Similar planes and edges are such as are similar in position, and of like angles with reference to the axes or axial planes. Moreover, in the case of similar edo-es, the two planes by whose intersection the edges are formed, meet at the same angle of inclination. For example, all the planes and edges of the tetrahedron (f. 9), regular octahedron (f. 11), cube (f. 14), rhombic dodecahedron (f. 19), are similar. In the rhombohedron (f. 16) there are two sets of similar edges, six being obtnse and six acute. Solid angles are similar when alike in plane angles each for each, and when formed by the meeting of planes of the same kind. A combination-edge is the edge formed by the meeting or intersection of two planes."], [22, "4 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Truncations, bevelments. \u2014 In a crystal, an edge or angle is said to be re placed when the place of the edge or angle is occupied by one or more jilanes ; and in the case of the replacement of an edge, the replacing planes make parallel intersections with the including planes, that is, with the direction of the replaced edge (f. 43). A replacement of an edge or angle is a truncation when the replacing plane makes equal angles with the including planes. Thus, in f. 6, i-i truncates the edge between / and 1. An edge is said to be bevelled when it is replaced by two similar planes, that is, by planes having like inclinations to the adjoining planes. Thus, in f. 5, the edge between 3, 3, is bevelled by the two planes 3-3, 3-3, the right 3-3 and 3 having the same mutual inclination as the left 3-3 and 3. So, in f. 192, p. 43, the edge between /and I is bevelled by the planes i-2, i-2- Truncations and bevelments of edges take place only between similar planes. Thus 1, 1, and 3, 3, are similar planes in fig. 5. The edge i\\i might be truncated or bevelled, for the same reason ; but not the edge between 1 and /, since 1 and / are dissimilar planes. A zone is a series of planes in which the combination-edges or mutual intersections axe parallel. Thus, in fig. 3. the planes 1, 3, /make a vertical zone; so in f. S, the planes between 1 and i-i make a zone, and this zone actually continues above and below, around the crystal ; in f. 5, the planes 3, 3-3, 3-3, 3 are in one zone ; and i-i, I, i-i, I, in another. On the true meaning of zones, see p. 53. The above explanations are preliminary to the descrip tions of the forms of all crystals. A. \u2014 Forms contained under four equal triangular planes. \u2014 A. Regu lar tetrahedron (f. !)). Edges six ; solid angles four. Faces equilateral trian gles, and plane angles therefore 60\u00b0.

Plane and interfacial angles varying ; the latter of two kinds, (a) two terminal, (b) four lateral. Named from <r<f>rjv, a wedge. B. \u2014 Forms contained under eight triangular planes. \u2014 The solids here included are called octahedrons, from otcTatcK, eight times, and eSpa, face. They have twelve edges ; and six solid angles. One of the axes, when they differ in length, is made the vertical axis ; and the others are the lateral axes. The solid angles at the extremities of the vertical axes are the vertical or terminal solid angles ; the other fonr are the lateral. The four edges meeting in the apex of the terminal solid angle are the terminal edges ; the others, the lateral or basal edges. i. Regular Octahedron (f. 11). Faces equilateral triangles. Interfacial angles 109\u00b0 28' 16\" ; angle between the planes over the apex of a solid angle 70\u00b0 31' 44\" ; angle between edges over a solid angle 90\u00b0. The three axes are equal, and hence either may be made the vertical. Lines connect ing the centres of opposite faces are called the octahedral or trigonal inter-"], [23, "5 crystallography. axes ; and those connecting the centres of opposite edges the dodecahedral or rhombic interaxes. 2. Square Octahedron (f. 12, f. 12a). Faces equal isosceles triangles, not equilateral. The four terminal edges are ecpial and similar; and so also the four lateral. 11 12 12a 13 The lateral axes are equal; the vertical axis may be longer or shorter than the lateral. 3. The rhombic octahedron (f. 13) differs from the square octahedron in having a rhombic base, and consequently the three axes are unequal. The basal edges are equal and similar ; but, owing to the unequal lengths of the lateral axes, the terminal edges are of two kinds, two being shorter and more obtuse than the other two. C. \u2014 Forms contained under six equal planes. \u2014 The forms here in cluded have the planes parallelograms ; the edges are twelve in number and equal ; the solid angles eight. 1. Cube (f . 14). Faces equal squares, and plane angles therefore 90\u00b0. The twelve edges similar as well as equal ; the eight solid angles similar and equal. Interfacial angles 90\u00b0. The three axes equal and intersecting at right angles. Lines connecting the apices of the solid angles are the octahedral or tri gonal interaxes, and those connecting the centres of opposite edges the dodecahedral ov rhombic- interaxes. if the cubic axis (=edge of the cube) = 1, then the dodecahedral interaxes = 1/2 =1.41421 ; and the octahedral interaxes = \\/3 \u2014 1.73205. Aud if the dodecahedral axis = 1, then the octahedral = 1.224745. U 15 16 17 18 r\\ If a cube is placed with the apex of one angle vertically over that diagonally opposite, that is, with an octahedral interaxis vertical, the parts are all symmetrically arranged around this vertical axis. In this position (f. 15) the cube has three planes inclined toward one apex, and three toward the other ; it has three terminal edges meeting at each apex ; and six late ral edges situated symmetrically, but in a zigzag, around the vertical axis. If lines are drawn connecting the centres of the opposite lateral edges, and these are taken as the lateral axes, the lateral axes, three in number, will lie in a plane at right angles to the vertical, and will intersect at the centre at angles of 60D. The cube placed in this position would then have"], [24, "6 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. one vertical and three equal lateral axes ; and as the lateral axes correspond to the dodeca hedral interaxes of a cube, the ratio of a lateral axis to the vertical is 1 : 1.224745. 2. Rhombohedron (f. 16 to 18). Faces equal rhombs. The twelve edges of two kinds ; six obtuse, and six acute. Solid angles of two kinds ; two symmetrical, consisting each of three equal plane angles ; the other six un symmetrical, the plane angles enclosing them being of two kinds. The rhombohedron resembles a cube that has been either shortened, or lengthened, in the direction of one of the octahedral axes, the former mak ing an obtuse rhombohedron, the latter an acute; and it is in position when this axis is vertical, the parts being situated symmetrically about this axis, as in the second position of the cube above described. In an obtuse rhom bohedron (f. 16, 17), the terminal solid angles are bounded by three obtuse plane angles, and the other six, which are the lateral, by two acute and one obtuse : the six terminal edges (three meeting at each apex) are obtuse, and the six lateral edges are acute. Conversely, in au acute rhombohedron (f. 18) the terminal angles are made up of acute plane angles, and the lateral of two obtuse and one acute ; the six terminal edges are acute, and the six lateral obtuse. The axes are a vertical, and three lateral ; the lateral axes connect the centres of opposite lateral edges and intersect at angles of 60\u00b0. The cube in the second position (f. 15) corresponds to a rhombohedron of 90\u00b0, or is intermediate between the obtuse and the acute series. D. \u2014 Forms contained under twelve equal planes. 1. Rhombic Dodecahedron (f. 19). Faces rhombs, with the 19 plane angles 109\u00b0 28' 16\", 70\u00b0 31' 44\". Edges twenty-four, all similar ; interfacial angle over each edge 120\u00b0. Solid angles of two kinds : (a) six acute tetrahedral, bein^ formed of four acute plane angles; and (b) eight obtuse trihedral, being formed of three obtuse plane angles. Angle between planes over apex of tetrahedral solid angle, 90\u00b0 ; angle between edges over the same 109\u00b0 28' 16\". The axes three, equal, rectangular, and therefore identical with those of the regular octahedron and cube. The dodecahedral interaxes connect the centres of opposite faces ; and the octahedral the apices of the trihedral solid angles. Named from Sco&etca, twelve, and face. 20 eSpa, 2. Pyramidal dodecahedron, or Quartzoid, (Called also Dihexagonal Pyramid, Isosceles Dodecahedron.) Faces isosceles triangles, and arranged in two pyramids placed base to base (f . 20). Edges of two kinds : twelve equal terminal, and six equal basal; axes, a vertical differ ing in length in different species; and three lateral, equal, situated in a plane at right angles to the vertical, and in tersecting one another at angles of 60\u00b0, as in the rhombo hedron. E. \u2014 Prisms.\u2014 Prismatic forms consist of at least two sets of planes, the basal planes being unlike the lateral. The bases are always equal ; and the lateral planes parallelograms. The vertical axis is unequal to the lateral, (a) Three-sided prism. A right (or erect) prism, having its bases equal equilateral triangles, (b) Fimr-sided prisms. Four sided prisms are either right (erect), or oblique, the former having the vertical axis"], [25, "7 crystallography. at right angles to the base or to the plane of the lateral axes, and the latter oblique. 1. Square or Tetragonal Prism (f. 21, 22). Base a square ; lateral planes equal. Edges of two kinds : (a) eight basal, equal, each contained between the base and a lateral plane ; (b) four lateral, contained between the equal lateral planes. Interfacial angles all 90\u00b0, plane angles 90\u00b0. Solid anodes eight, of one kind. Axes : a vertical, differing in length in different species, and longer or shorter than the lateral ; two lateral, equal, at right angles to one another and to the vertical, and connecting either the centres of opposite lateral planes (f. 21) or edges (f. 22). The cube is a square prism with the vertical axis equal to the lateral. 2. Right Rhombic Prism (f. 23). Base a rhomb ; lateral planes equal parallelograms. Edges of three kinds : (a) eight basal, equal, and rectan gular as in the preceding form ; (b) two lateral, obtuse; and (c) two lateral, acute. Solid angles of two kinds ; (a) obtuse at the extremities of the ob tuse edge, and (b) acute at the extremities of the acute edge. Axes rect angular, unequal ; a vertical ; a longer lateral, the maerodiagonal axis (named from ixcucpos, large), and a shorter lateral, the brachydiagonal axis (named from (3pa-%vs, short). 3. Right Rectangular Prism (f. 24). Base a rectangle, and in conse quence of its unequal sides, two opposite lateral planes of the prism are broader than the' other two. Edges all rectangular, but of three kinds ; (a) four longer basal ; (b) four shorter basal ; (c) four lateral. Axes con necting the centres of opposite faces, rectangular, unequal; a vertical, a maerodiagonal, and a brachydiagonal, being like those of the right rhom bic prism. In the rectangular prism, either of the faces may be made the basal, and either axis, consequently, the vertical. 4. Oblique Prisms. Figs. 25 and 26 represent prisms oblique in the direction of one axis. As seen in them, the vertical axis c is oblique to the lateral axis d, called the clinodiagonal axis ; but, b, the orthodiagonal axis, is at right angles to both c and d. Similarly, the axial sections cb, ba are mutually oblique in their inclinations, while ca, cb and ca, ba are at right angles. The clinodiagonal section ca is called the section or plane of sym metry. The form in f. 25 is sometimes called an oblique rhombic prism. The edges are of two kinds as to length, but of four kinds as to interfacial angles over them : (a) four basal obtuse ; (b) four basal acute ; (c) two lateral ob tuse : (d) two lateral acute. The prism is in position when placed with the clinodiagonal section vertical. Figs. 27 and 28 show the doubly oblique, or oblique rhomboidal prism, in which all the axes, aud hence all the axial sections, are oblique to each"], [26, "8 crystallography. other. All these cases will receive further attention in the description of actual crystalline forms. The prisms (in f. 21, 24, 26, 28) in which the planes are parallel to the three diametral sections, are sometimes called diametral prisms. This term also evidently includes the cube. The planes which form these diametral prisms are often called pinacoids. The terminal plane is the basal pinacoid, or simply base ; also, in f. 24 the plane (lettered i-i) parallel to the macrodiagonal section is called the macropinacoid, and the plane (i-i) parallel to the brachydiagonal the brachypinacoid. In f. 26 the plane (i-i) parallel the to orthodiagonal section is called the orthi pinacoid, aud the plane (i-i) parallel to the clinodiagonal section the clinopinacoid. The word pinacoid is from the Greek irCvat;, a board. (c). Six-sided Prism. \u2014 The Hexagonal prism. 29 30 Base an equilateral hexagon. Edges of two kinds: (a) twelve basal, equal and similar, (b) six lateral, ecpial and similar ; interfacial angle over the former 90\u00b0, over the latter 120\u00b0. Solid angles, twelve, similar. Axes : a vertical, of different length in different species ; three late ral equal, intersecting at angles of 60\u00b0, as in the rhombohedron, and the dihexagonal pyramid or quartzoid, connecting the centres either of the lateral edges (f. 29), or lateral faces (f . 30). 3. Systems of Crystallization. The systems of crystallization are based on the mathematical relations of the forms ; the axes are lines assumed in order to exhibit these relations, they mark the degree of symmetry which belongs to each group of forms, and which is in fact the fundamental distinction between them. The num ber of axes, as has been stated, is either tJiree or four \u2014 the number being four when there are three lateral axes, as occurs only in hexagonal forms. Among the forms with three axes, all possible conditions of the axes exist both as to relative lengths and inclinations ; that is, there are (as has been exemplified in the forms which have been described), (A) among ortho metric kinds, or those with rectangular axial intersections ; (a) the three axes equal ; (b) two equal, and the other longer or shorter than the two ; (c) the three unequal ; and (B) among clinometric kinds, one or more of the intersections ma)7 be oblique (in all of these the three axes are unequal). The systems are then as follows : A. Axes three ; orthometric. 1. Isometric System. \u2014 Axes equal. Examples, cube, regular octahe dron, rhombic dodecahedron."], [27, "9 crystallography. 2. Tetragonal System. \u2014 Lateral axes equal ; the vertical a varying axis. Ex., square prism, square octahedron. 3. Orthorhombic System. \u2014 Axes unequal. Ex., right rhombic prism, rectangular prism, rhombic octahedron. B. Axes three ; clinometric. 1. Monoclinic System. \u2014 Axes unequal ; one of the axial intersections oblique, the other two rectangular. Ex., the oblique prisms (f. 25, 26). 2. Triclinic System. \u2014 Axes unequal ; three of the axial intersections ob lique. Ex., oblique rhomboidal prism (f. 27, 28). C. Axes four. \u2014 Hexagonal System. \u2014 Three lateral axes equal, intersect ihg at angles of 60\u00b0. The vertical axis of variable length. Example, hexagonal prisms (f . 29, 30). The so-called Diclinic system (two oblique axes) is not known to occur, for the single sub stance, an artificial salt, supposed to crystallize in this system has been shown by von Zepha rovich to be triclinic. Moreover, von Lang, Quenstedt, and others have shown mathemati cally that there can be only six distinct systems. The six systems may also be arranged in the following groups : 1. Tsom etric (from laos, equal, and ixk-rpov, measure), the axes being all ecpial ; including: I. Isometric System. 2. Isodiamttric, the lateral axes or diameters being equal ; including : II. Tetragonal System ; III. Hexagonal System. 3. Anisometric (from dvt<jo<i, unequal, etc.), the axes being unequal ; in cluding : IV. Orthorhombic System; V. Monoclinic System ; VI. Tri clinic System. A further stud)7 of these different systems will show that in group 1 the crystals are formed or developed alike in all three axial directions; in group 2 the development is alike in the several lateral directions, but un like vertically ; and in group 3 the crystals are formed unlike in all three directions. These distinctions are of the highest importance in relation to the physical characters of minerals, especially their optical properties, and are often referred to beyond. The numbers (in Roman numerals) here connected with the names of the system are often used in place of the names in the course of this Treatise. The systems of crystallization have been variously named by different authors, as follows : 1. Isometric Tessular of Mohs and Haidinger ; Isometric of Hausmann ; Tesseral of Nau mann ; Regular of Weiss and Rose ; Cubic of Dufrenoy, Miller, DesCloizeaux; Monometric of the earlier editions of Dana's System of Mineralogy. 2. Tetragonal. Pyramidal of Mohs ; Viergliedriege, or Zwei-und-einaxige, of Weiss ; Tetragonal of Naumann ; Monodimetric of Hausmann ; Quadratic of von Kobell ; Dimetric of early editions of Dana's System. 3. Hexagonal. Rhombohedral of Mohs ; Sechsgliedrige, or Drei-und-einaxige of Weiss; Hexagonal of Naumann ; Monotrimetric of Hausmann. 4. Orthorhombic Prismatic, or Orthotype, of Mohs; Ein-und-einaxige of Weiss; Rhombic and Anisometric of Naumann; Trimetric and Orthorhombic of Hausmann ; Trinict ric of earlier editions of Dana's System. 5. Monoclinic Hemiprismatic and Hemiorthotype of Mohs ; Zicei-und-eingliederige of Weiss; Monoclinohdral of Naumann ; Clinorhombic of v. Kobell, Hausmann, Des Cloizeaux ; Augitic of Haidinger ; Oblique of Miller; Monosymmetric of Groth. 6. Triclinic Tetarto-prismatic of Mohs ; Ein-und-einglicderige of Weiss ; Triclinohedral of Naumann ; Ciinorhomboidal of v. Kobell ; Anorthic of Haidinger and Miller ; Anorthic, or Doubly Oblique, of Des Cloizeaux ; Asymmetric, of Groth."], [28, "10 crystallography. 4. Laws with reference to the planes of Crystals. The laws with reference to the positions of the planes of crystals are two: first, the law of simple mathematical ratio; secondly, the law of symmetry. 1. The Law op simple Mathematical Ratio. The crystallographic axes afford the means, after the methods of analyti cal geometry, of expressing with precision the relative positions of the planes of crystals, and so exhibiting the mathematical ratios pertaining to crystallization. These axes, as has been stated, are supposed to pass through the centre of the crystal, and every plane must intersect one, two, or three of them. The position of a plane is obviously determined by the position of the points in which it meets these axes. Thus the plane AB C, f. 31, meets the three axes at the points A, B, and C, and its position is determined by the dis tances O A, O B, O C, intercepted be tween these points and the centre O. Similarly the plane A B D meets the axes in the points A, B, and D, and its position is determined b)7 the distances O A, O B, O D ; and in the same manner with any other plane. On the crystals of a given species the occurring planes have exact numerical relations to each other, and it is to show these relations that certain lengths of the axes are assumed as units. Thns, in the case already given if O C, O B, O A, or more briefly c, b, a, are the lengths of the axes * (strictly speaking semi-axes) for a given species, then the position of the first plane is expressed by \\c : lb : la ; that of the second by 2c : lb : la (if OD = 20C), and still another plane might be 2c : 2b : la, and so on. Consequently the general position of any plane may be expressed by me : no : ra,\\ or more simply me : nb : a, as every plane is for simplicity snpposed to meet one of the axes at the unit distance. In the first case mentioned above, m =1 and n \u2022**\u2022= 1 ; but in general m and n may vary in value from zero to infinity. The law of simple mathematical ratio, how ever, requires that m and . ., which express the ratios in the lengths of the I axes, should be invariably rational numbers, and in general they are either whole numbers or simple fractions. This principle may be stated as follows : The position of the planes in a given crystal is related in some simple ratio to the relative lengths of the axes. * The vertical axis is throughout called <\u2022 , see p. 53. \u25a0f It is more usual, and analytically more correct, to write this expression ra : nb : me ; but as the usual symbols take the form m-n, the order of the terms used here and elsewhere is more convenient."], [29, "11 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. This subject will become clear in the subsequent study of the different crystalline forms ; in passing, however, reference may be made to f. 32 (zircon) * as a single example. The planes lettered 1 and 3 have respectively the positions, lc : \\b : la, and 3c :1b : la, and in the second case the vertical axis has exactly three times the length of that of the former ; any such multiples as 2.93 or 3.07 are crystallographically impossible. It is this principle which makes crystallography an exact mathematical science. Some apparent exceptions, such as occasionally occur, do not at all set aside this rule. The expression me : lib : a is called the symbol of a plane, as it expresses its exact mathematical position, and the values of -m and n are called its parameters. If a plane intersects two of the axes, but not the third, it is parallel to it, and mathematically it is said to cut it at infinity (oo ) ; hence the general expression for a plane parallel to the vertical axis c (as in f . 33) will be oo *c : nb '.a, or oo c : b : na, according as a or b is taken as the unit ; for a plane parallel to the lateral axis b (as in f. 34), it will be me : cnb : a ; if parallel to the lateral axis a (as in f . 35), me : b : oo a. If a plane is parallel to two axes, b and a, that is, intercepts these axes at an infinite distance, its position is expressed by c : co b : co a, as is illus trated by f. 36 ; again, its position is expressed by co c : b : co a, if parallel to c and a ; and by oo c : oo b : a, if parallel to c, b. These may also be written 0c : b : a, etc. The following important principle should be kept in mind. The relative not the absolute position of any plane has to be regarded, and hence all planes parallel to each other are crystallographically identical. A plane on the angle of the cube is the same, if the mutual inclinations re main unchanged, whether large or small, for, though the actual distances cut off on the axes may differ in each case, the ratios of these axes are iden tical. Again, in f. 37, the three planes, 4c : 45 : 2a, and 2c :2b : a, and c : b : %a are identical, for the ratios of the three axes are the same throughout, the planes being of course parallel. Similarly the symbol le : \\b : \\a may be written 3c : b : a,"], [30, "12 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. and c: cob: go a is the same as Oc : b : a. It will be seen that this prin ciple makes it right to regard every plane as meeting one of the axes at the unit distance from the centre, which, as before stated, reduces the general expression of any plane me : nb : ra to the simpler form me : nb : a, or me : b : na. The principle, which has just been stated, also makes it evident that when the axes are all equal, they are not necessarily considered in naming the position of any plane ; when the lateral axes alone are equal, a certain length of the vertical axis must be assumed for each species ; and when all the axes are unequal, certain lengths for two of the axes, expressed in terms of the third axis, must in every case be adopted. Hence the fundamental form of any species may be regarded as that octahedron whose axes correspond in relative lengths with the axes c, b, a adopted for the species. The faces of this octahedron intersect the axes at distances from the centre equal to nc, nb, na (or c :b : a) respectively, and, since the ratio of the coefficients which expresses the position of these planes is 1:1:1, this form is also called the unit octahedron. But the form is not necessarily fundamental ; for it is frequently more or less arbi trarily assumed, and the structure or genesis of the crystals of a species may point to other forms, having very different axial relations, as will appear from facts stated beyond. MoD\"ELS.\u2014 For clear illustration of the axes and axial ratios of planes it is well to have models of the axes made of rods of wood mortised and glued together at the crossing at centre. The rods may be half an inch in diameter and 10 or 12 inches long ; for the Isometric system, three equal rods, say 12 inches long ; for the Tetragonal system, two of 12 inches for the lateral axes and one of 8 or 14 inches for the vertical ; for the Orthorhombic, one of 10 inches for axis *, one of 10 inches for axis c, and one of 14 inches for axis a. (Either axis may be made the vertical by way of change.) For the Clinornetric systems, make a second model like that for the Orthorhombic system, but with the rods but loosely mortised and tied together, so as to admit of a little movement at centre. Then, the model when in its more natural position will be that of the orthorhom bic system, the intersections being all rectangular. But by pushing the front rud a down in the plane of ca, making it thus oblique to c while at right angles to b, the model will repre sent the monoclinic axes ; if all the intersections of the rods are oblique, the model will represent the axes of the Triclinic system. Now by taking a large piece of thick pasteboard, and placing it in different positions with reference to the three axes, the relations to the various planes may be readily illustrated. Models of the various forms of crystals are also of the highest importance ; and the best for general illustration are those made of plate glass, some of them having the positions of the axes within indicated by threads, and others consisting of one form inside of another to show their mutual relations. Such glass models (first made by Professor Dana, in 1835, and recommended in the first edition of his Mineralogy) are now manufactured of great per fection at Siegen, in German}-. Pasteboard models, likewise useful aids to the study of crystallography, are easily made from the outlines of the faces of the various forms, which have been prepared by various authors. Models cut in hard wood representing the actual forms of the various mineral species are very valuable, when accurately made. They not only show the relations of different planes, but may also be advantageously used to give the student practice in the mathematical cal culations of the axes and parameters, the angles being measured by him as on an actual crystal. Such models have the advantage of being of convenient size, and symmetrically formed, which are conditions not often realized in the crystals furnished by nature. 2. Law of Symmetry. The symmetry of crystals is based upon the law that either :"], [31, "13 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. I. All parts of a crystal similar in position with reference to the axes are similar in planes or modification, or II. Each half of the similar parts of a crystal, alternate or symmetri cal in position or relation to the other half, may be alone similar in its planes or modifications. The forms resulting according to the first method are termed holohe dral forms, from o\\os, all, e$pa, face ; and those according to the second, hemihedral, from i]fj,tcrv<;, half. According to the law of full or holohedral symmetry, each sectant in one of the rectangular systems (a) should have the same planes both as to num ber aud kind ; and (b) whatever the kinds, in each sectant there should be as many of each kind as are geometrically possible. But in hemi/iedrism, either (a) planes ot a kind occur only in half of the sectants ; or else (b) half the full number occur in all the sectants. In the isometric system, for example, if one solid angle of a cube has upon it a plane equally inclined to the diametral sections, so will each of the other angles (or sectants) (f. 39-42). If one of the twelve edges of the cube has a plane equally inclined to the enclosing cubic faces (or diametral planes) the others will have the same (f. 43-^:6). Again, one of the solid angles of a cube being replaced by six planes, as in f. 70, this law requires that the same six planes should appear on all the other solid angles. But under the law of hemihedrism these planes may occur on half the solid angles of the cube, and not on the other half, as in f . 87, or half the full number of planes may occur on all the angles, as in f. 101. This subject is further elucidated in the discussion of the hemihedral forms belonging to each system of crystallization. Hemihedrism is of various kinds : 1. Holomoiphic, in which the occuring planes pertain equally to both the upper and lower (or opposite) ranges of sectants, as in all ordinary hemi hedral forms. 2. Hemimorphic, in which the planes pertain to either the upper or the lower range, and not to both, and hence the planes are only half enough of the kind to enclose a space, whence the term hemimorphic, from ijfiiav^, half, and fi6pcj>r),form. The holomorphic forms may be either : A. Hemiholohedral, half the sectants having the full number of planes, or B. Holohemihedral, all the sectants having half the whole number of planes. Again, as to the relative positions of the sectants containing the planes, the forms may be : a. Vertically-direct, in which the sectants of the upper and of the lower ranges are alternate, but the upper not alternate with reference to the lower,"], [32, "14 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. and, accordingly, each plane above is in the same vertical zone with a like plane below ; as in forms described on pp. 34, 35. b. Vertically-alternate, in which the sectants of the upper and lower ranges are alternate, and also the upper are alternate with reference to the lower, and, accordingly, each plane above is not in the same vertical zone with alike plane below; as in the tetrahedron (f. 9), rhombohedron (f. 16), and gyroidal forms (f. 182). c. \" Vertically-oblique, in which the sectants of the upper and lower ranges are adjacent, but the upper are situated diagonally with reference to the lower, being on the opposite side of a transverse diametral or diagonal plane ; as in hemihedrons of monoclinic habit under the orthorhombic system (p. 45). Tetartohedrism. \u2014 Mathematically the rhombohedron is a hemihedron un der the hexagonal system, consequently the forms that are hemihedral to the rhombohedron are tetartohedrons, or quarter-forms. See p. 39. Tetartohedral forms, or those with one-fourth of the normal number of planes, have also been observed in the Isometric system. The term mero hedrism, from p.ipo<;, part, and eSpa, face, has been used in place of hemi hedrism, to include both this and tetartohedrism. I.\u2014ISOMETRIC SYSTEM. A. Holohedral Forms. In the Isometric system the axes are equal, so that either one may be the vertical axis, and each may be called a. It has already been shown that the general expression for any plane meeting the axes c, b, a is me : nb : a; and in this system it will be ma : na : a, or, since the axes are equal, simply m : n : 1. Now it has been shown also that according as a plane intersects the several axes at different points, or is parallel to one or more of them, this fact is indicated by the values given for m and n in each case (p. 11). Hence expressions for all the forms geometrically possible in this system will be obtained if to ... and;., in the general expression ma : na : a, succes sive values are given. These values may be in this system, 0, 1, a number greater than 1, or co . In this way are derived : \u2014 1. m : n : 1 [m-n] when m and n have both different values greater than unity. 2. m: m:l [m-m] when \u25a0;.. > 1,'n = .... 3. m : 1 : 1 [...] when ... > 1, n = 1. 4. 1:1:1 [1] when ... and n = 1. 5. oo : n : 1 [i-n] when ... = co , . . > 1. 6. co : 1 : 1 [i~\\ when m = oo , n = 1. 7. co : co : 1 [II] when ... and 71=00. In lettering the planes of the several forms only the essential part of the symbol is used: the cube is H (hexahedron) ; the octahedron _.(=_.: 1 : 1) ; the dodecahedron i (00 \u25a0 1 \u25a0 1) ( i stands for infinity) ; m is used for the planes \u00bb.:!:]; m-m f or m : m : 1 ; i-n for 00 \u25a0 n \u25a0 1 \u25a0"], [33, "15 isometric system. m-n for m : n : 1. These symbols are the same as those of Naumann, except that he wrote oo instead of i for infinity, and introduced also the letter 0 (octahedron) as the sign of the system ; <x> 0 oo of his system =._/; 0=1 ; oo 0=i ; m 0=m ; m 0 m\u2014m-m, oo 0 n=i-n, and m 0 n=m-n. Each of these expressions, appearing at first sight possibly a little obscure, may be translated into simple language. Cube. \u2014 The cube with the symbol oo : oo : 1, is composed of planes each one of which is parallel to two of the axes, and meets the third at its unit point (see f . 36). It is evident that there are six such planes, one at each extremity of the three axes, and the figure or ciystal which is enclosed by these six planes has already been described (p. 5) as the cube (f. 3S). Octahedron. \u2014 The symbol 1:1:1 comprises all those planes which meet the three axes at the same distance, that is, cut off the unit length of each. It is evident that there must be eight such planes, one in each octant, and they together form the regular octahedron (f. 42), which has already been described, p. 4. Dodecahedron. \u2014 The symbol co : 1 : 1 includes those planes which inter cept two of the axes at the same unit distance, and are parallel to the third. There can be twelve planes answering to these conditions, and they form together the dodecahedron (f. 45, see also p. 6). These three forms, the cube, octahedron, and dodecahedron, are those most commonly occurring in this system, and it is important that their rela tion should be thoroughly understood. The transitions between these forms, as they modify one another, are exhibited in the following figures : 38 39 40 41 42 Figs. 3S and 42 represent the cube and octahedron, and 39, 40, 41, the intermediate forms. Slicing off from the eight angles of a cube piece after piece, such that the planes made are equally inclined to H, or the cubic faces, the cube is finally converted into the regular octahedron ; and the last disappearing point of each face of the cube is the apex of each solid angle of the octahedron. The axes of the former, therefore, of necessity connect the apices of the solid angles of the latter. The form in f. 40 is called a cubo-octaliedron. H r\\l=12o\u00b0 15' 52\". If the twelve edges of the cube are truncated (for all will be truncated if one is) it affords the form in f . 43 ; then that of f . 44 ; then the dodecahe-"], [34, "16 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. dron, f. 45 ; the axes of the cube becoming, in the transition, the axes^ con necting the tetrahedral solid angles of the dodecahedron ; H A * = 135\u00b0. If the twelve edges of the octahedron (f. 42) are truncated, the form in f. 47 results ; and bv continuing the replacement, finally the dodecahedron again is formed (f. 45). 1A. = 144\u00b0 44' 8\". The last point of the face of the octahedron, as it disappears, is the apex of the trihedral solid angle of the dodecahedron. These forms are thus mutually derivable. The process may be reversed, the cube being derivable from the dodecahedron by the truncation of the tetrahedral solid angles of the latter (compare in succession f. 45, 44, 43, 38) ; and the octahedron by the truncation of the trihedral solid angles (compare f. 45, 47, 42). These remarks are important as showing the rela tions between these forms, though it is of course not intended to be under stood that they are in any sense\" derived from each other in this manner in nature. The three axes (or cubic axes) connect the centres of opposite faces in the cube ; the apices of opposite solid angles in the octahedron ; the apices of opposite tetrahedral solid angles in the dodecahedron. The eight trigonal or octahedral interaxes connect the centres of opposite \u25a0faces in the octahedron ; the apices of opposite solid angles in the cube ; the apices of opposite trihedral solid angles in the dodecahedron. The twelve rhombic or dodecahedral interaxes connect the centres of op posite faces in the dodecahedron ; the centres of opposite edges both in the cube and the octahedron. In a vertical section, containing each of these kinds of axes, the octahe dral interaxis intersects one of the three cubic axes at the angles 54\u00b0 44' 8\" and 125\u00b0 15' 52\", and one of the dodecahedral interaxes, at the an gles 35\u00b0 15' 52\" and 144\u00b0 44' 8\". 48 There remain four other holohe dral forms belonging to the system as contained in the list on page 14. Trisoctahedrons. \u2014 The symbol in : 1 : 1 is of that solid each of whose planes meets two of the axes at the unit distance, and the third axis at some distance which is a multiple of this unit length. It will be evident, as in f. 48, that there are three such planes in each of the eight sectants, and hence the total number of planes by which the solid is bounded is twenty-four. The resulting solid is called a trigonal trisoctahedron, and one, having ... = \u00a7, is shown in f. 49. It will be found a very valuable practice for the student to construct the figures of the successive crystalline forms in this way, laying off the proper lengths of the several axes and"], [35, "17 ISOMETRIC SYSTEM. noting the points where the different planes intersect. Further remarks on the drawing of crystals will be found in the Appendix. 49 The symbol m : in : 1 belongs to all the planes which meet one axis at the unit distance, and the others at equal distances which are multiples of the former. As seen in the preceding case, there will be three such planes in each of the eight sectants, and the total number consequently will be twenty-four. The solid is seen in f. 50, and is called a tetragonal trisoctahedron, or a trapezohedron. Both these forms are called trisoctahedrons, from three times, and octahedron, because in each a three-sided pyramid occupies the position of the planes of the regular octahedron. They are closely related to each other ; starting with the form m, : 1 : 1, if m is diminished till it equals unity, then the symbol becomes 1:1:1, that is, it has passed into the octa hedron. If m becomes less than unity, the symbol maybe, for example, -J* : 1 : 1, which is identical, as has been ex plained (p. 11) with 1:2:2 (2-2), and this is the symbol of the second trisoctahedron. This explains why, in the first list comprising all the possible forms, m was in no case made less than unity. Trigonal-trisoctahedron. \u2014 In this form the solid angles are of two kinds : the trigonal or octahedral, and the octagonal or cubic. The edges are thirty-six in number, twenty-four of one kind, forming the octahedral or trihedral solid angles, and twelve edges meeting at the extremities of the cubic axes. Each of the twenty-four planes is an isosceles triangle. In combination with the cube, the form 2 appears as a replacement of each of the solid angles by three planes equally inclined on the edges ; this is seen in f. 52. With the octahedron, it appears as a bevelment of its twelve edges, as shown in f. 53. It also replaces the eight trigonal solid angles of a dodecahedron bj7 three planes inclining on the faces. The more commonly occurring examples of this form are 2 (=2 : 1 : 1), also \u00a7 (=f : 1 : 1), and 3 (3 : 1 : 1). The Tetragonal-trisoctahedron or trapezohedron, has three kinds of solid angles : six cubic, whose truncations are cubic faces (f. 56) ; eight octahe dral, whose truncations are octahedral faces (f. 56) ; twelve dodecahedral, truncated by the dodecahedral planes (f. 60). It has forty-eight edges ; twenty -four of one kind, those of the trihedral or octahedral solid angles, and the remaining twenty -four, also of one kind, meeting in the cubic solid angles. Each of the twenty-four faces is a quadrilateral. In combination with the cube it is seen in f. 55, 56,- appearing as a re placement of each of the solid angles by three planes equally inclined on 2"], [36, "18 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the faces of the cube. Fi<*s. 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, also show it m com bination with the octahedron and dodecahedron. The most commonly occurring of this series is 2-2 ( = 2 : 2 : l),f. 54 ; as seen in f. 59, it truncates the twenty -four edges of the dodecahedron. On the other hand the form 54 55 50 57 58 59 60 61 63 63 |-| would replace the trihedral solid angles by planes inclined on the edges, while 3-3 replaces (f. 62), the tetrahedral solid angles of the dodecahedron, by planes also inclined on the edges. Tetrahexahedron. \u2014 The symbol co : n : 1 (i-n) belongs to all the planes which are parallel to one axis, meet a second at the unit distance, and the third at some multiple of that. There are twenty-four planes which satisfy these conditions, and they form the tetrahexahedron ; f. 64, 65, represent two varieties of tetrahexahedrons. It will be seen that the planes are so arranged that a square pyramid corresponds to each of the six faces of the cube; and hence the name from rerpatcfi, four times, e\u00a3, six, and eSpa, face, it being a 4x0-faced solid. The tetrahexahedron has six tetrahe dral solid angles and eight hexahedral or octahedral solid angles. There are twenty-four edges of one kind forming the former solid angles, and twelve edges occupying the position of the cubic edges. Each of the twenty -four faces is an isosceles triangle. In combination with the cube it produces a bevelment of its twelve edges, as represented in f . 64. 64 65 66 67 68 The tetrahexahedron, in f. 65, lettered i-2, has the symbol oo : 2 : 1 ; and that of f. GQ, lettered i-3, co : 3 : 1. Some of the other occurring kinds are those with the ratios, 2 : 3, 3 : 4, 4 : 5, etc., etc. The relation of the tetrahexahedron to the octahedron is shown in f. 67. By comparing this figure with f. 42, it is seen that the planes i-2 replace"], [37, "ISOMETRIC SYSTEM. 19 the solid angles of the octahedron by planes inclined on its edges. Its rela tion to the dodecahedron is presented in f. 68, which is a dodecahedron (planes i being the dodecahedral planes, see f. 45) with the tetrahedral solid angles replaced by four planes inclined each on an *. The tetrahexahedron is called a fiuoroid, by Haidinger, the form being common in fluorite. It is the Tetrakishexahedron (ov Pyramidenwiirfel) of Naumann. In accordance with considerations already presented it is evident that n, in the symbol i-n, may always be written as a whole number, for the symbol oo : -| : 1 is identical with oo : 1 : 2. Moreover it is seen that when n is oo , the form passes into the cube (\u00b0o : \u25a0\u00bb : 1), and as .. diminishes and becomes unity, it passes into the dodecahedron (oo : 1 : 1). Hexoctahedron. \u2014 The general form m : n includes the largest number of similar planes geometrically possible in this system. This symbol requires six planes in each octant, as will be seen by a method of con struction similar to that in f. 48, and consequently the whole solid has forty-eight planes. It is hence called a hexakisoctahedron (efa/ct?, six times, oktco, eight, and eSpa, face, i.e., a 6 x 8-faced solid) or hexoctahedron. The form is shown in f . 69, where it will be seen that there are three differ ent kinds of edges, and three kinds of solid angles; each of the forty eight planes is a scalene triangle. When modifying the cube it appears as six planes replacing each of the solid angles, f. 70. It replaces the eight angles of the octahedron, and the form 3-f bevels the twenty-four edges of the dodecahedron (f. 71). Other hexoctahedrons, differing in their angles, may replace the six acute solid an gles of the dodecahedron by eight planes, or the eight obtuse by six planes. The hexoctahedron of f. 69, 70, 71 is that whose planes have the axial ratio 3 : | : 1. Others have the ratio 4 : 2 : 1, 2 : f : 1 (=6 : 4 : 3), 5 : f : 1 (=15 : 5 : 3), 7 : _- : 1 (=21 : 7 : 3), etc. Amalgam. Magnetite."], [38, "20 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The preceding figures show dodecahedrons variously modified. In f . 72, I, or i, are faces of the dodecahedron ; Hoi the cube ; 1 of the octa hedron ; i-3 of a tetrahexahedron (f. 66) ; 2-2 of the trapezohedron of f . 54, 59 ; 3-f of the hexoctahedron of f. 69, 70. In f. 73, i, O, and 1 are as in f. 72 ; 3-3 is the trapezohedron of f. 61, 62 ; and 5-| (either side of 3-3) a hexoctahedron. The hexoctahedron is called the adamantoid by Haidinger, in allusion to its being a common form of crystals of diamond. It is the hexakisocta hedron of Naumann. B. Hemihedral Forms. Of the kinds of hemihedral forms mentioned on page 13, the hemiho lohedral, in which only half of the sectants are represented in the form, produces what are called inclined hemihedrons ; and the holohemihedral, in which all the sectants are represented by half the full number of planes, parallel hemihedrons. In the former the sectants to which the occurring planes belong are diagonally opposite to those without the same planes ; and hence no plane has another opposite and parallel to it; on the contrary, opposite planes are oblique to one another, and hence the name of inclined hemihedrons applied to them. They are also called tetrahedral forms, the tetrahedron being the simplest form of the number, and its habit character istic of them all ; while the latter are called pyritohedral, because observed in the species pyrite. The complete symbols of the inclined hemihedrons are written in the general form \u00a7(m : n : 1), of the parallel hemihedrons in the form \\ [m : n : 1] ; also written /_(\u00bb_ : n : 1) and iriin : n : 1) re spectively. a. Inclined or Tetrahedral Hemihedrons. 1. Tetrahedron, or Hemi octahedron. \u2014 *i(l : 1 : 1). As has been shown, the form 1(1 : 1 : 1) embraces eight planes, and when holohedrally developed it produces the octahedron ; in accordance, how ever, with the law of hemihedrism, half of the eight possible planes may occur in alternate octants; thus in two opposite sectants above, and the two diagonally opposite below, as shown by the shaded planes in f . 74. If"], [39, "21 ISOMETRIC SYSTEM. these four shaded planes are suppressed, while the other four of the octa hedron are extended, the resulting form is the regular tetrahedron, f. 76. The relation of the octahedron and tetrahedron maybe better understood from f. 75. If, as just remarked, the planes shaded in f. 74 are suppressed, while the others are extended, it will be seen in f. 75 that the two latter pairs intersect in edges parallel respectively to the basal edges of the octahedron, and the complete tetrahedron is the result. The axes, it is im portant to observe, connect the middle points of the opposite edges. Further than this, since either set of four planes may go to form the solid, two tetrahedrons are evidently possible, and they may be distinguished by calling the first, f. 76, positive, and the second negative, f. 76a. These terms are of course only relative. The plus and the minus tetrahe drons may occur in combination, as in f. 79 ; and though there are here pre sent the eight planes which in holohedral forms make the octahedron, and though they should happen to be equally developed so as to give the same shape, the crystal would still be pronounced tetrahedral, since the planes 1 and \u2014 1 are physically different. An example of this occurs in crystals of boracite, where the planes of one tetrahedron are polished while those of the other are without lustre. The plane angles of the tetrahedron are 60D, and the interfacial angles 70\u00b0 31' 44\". The combinations of the cube and tetrahedron are shown in f . 77 and 78, and the dodecahedron and tetrahedron in f . 80. As the octahedron results geometrically from slicing off successively the solid angles of the cube, by planes of equal inclination on the cubic faces, so also the tetrahedron may be made mechanically by slicing off similarly half these solid angles. Hemi-trisoctahedrons, \\{jn : m : l)and %(m : 1 : 1). In the same manner as with the tetrahedron, the form m-m, when hemihedral, may have half its twenty -four planes present, viz., those in the two opposite sectants above and the alternate sectants below. When these twelve planes are extended, the others being suppressed, they form the solid represented in f. 81 ; the symbol properly being \u25a0\u00a7\u25a0( m-m), or here -^(2-2). The faces, as will be ob served, are trigonal, and the solid is sometimes called a cuproid. There is the same distinction to be made here between the plus and the minus forms as with the tetrahedrons. Figs. 82, 83, 84 show combinations of + i(m-m) with the plus tetrahedron, the dodecahedron, and the tetrahexahedron. Similarly the form m, when heniihedral, according to the same principle results in the solid, f. S5. It is called the deltohedron by Haidinger ; it has trapezoidal faces. In f. 86, +\u00a3(\u00a7) is shown in combination with +|-(2-2). Here also the distinction between the plus and minus forms is to be made in the same manner as that already explained."], [40, "22 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Inclined or tetrahedral Hemi-hexoctahedron %(m : n : 1). The form m-n when developed according to the law of inclined hemihedrism, that is, when of its forty-eight faces, half are present, viz., all in half the whole number of sectants, produces the solid seen in f. 87. There is here also a plus solid, and a minus solid, corresponding to the + and \u2014 tetrahedron. in f. SS it is in combination with the plus tetrahedron. If the same method of inclined hemihedrism be applied to the remain ing solids of this system, the cube, dodecahedron, and tetrahexahedron, that is, if in each case the parts in two opposite sectants above, and the two diag onally opposite sectants below, be conceived to be extended, the other half being suppressed, it will be seen that the solid reproduces itself .; the hemi hedral form of the cube is the cube, and so of the others. The following figures represent some other combinations of these forms. Sphalerite. Sphalerite. Tetrahedrite. In f. 89, the cuproid3-3 is combined with the faces /of a dodecahedron. The form 3-3 resembles closely that of f. 81, but in its combination with the dodecahedron it does not truncate an edge of the dodecahedron, like 2-2 iu f . 83. Fig. 89a contains the same planes combined with the plus tetra hedron, hexagonal planes 1, the minus tetrahedron, triangular planes 1, and the faces of the cube II. The presence of the plane the com parison of the form with f. 55, 56, 57, p. 18, the plane 3-3 having the same position essentially with 2-2. Fig. 90 has as its most prominent planes those of f. 81 , but the position given it is relatively to f. 81 that of the minus hemihedron ; and there are also the small planes 2-2 about the angles, which are those of the minus hemihedron. II, are planes of the cube ; 1, those of the tetrahedron; i, those of the dodecahedron ; i-3 those of a tetrahexahedron (H, i, i-3 all holohedral) ; and f- the planes of a deltohe dron similar to f. S5, and occurring with 2-2 iu f. 86."], [41, "ISOMETRIC SYSTEM. 23 b. Parallel or pyritohedral hemihedrons. \u2014 According to the second law of hemihedrism, half the whole number of planes of any form may be pre sent in all the sectants. In the resulting solids each plane has another par allel to it. This method of hemihedrism obviously produces distinct forms only in those cases where there is an even number of planes in each octant. Pentagonal Dodecahedron, or Ilemi-tetrahexahedron, -i-(x> : n : 1). If of the twenty-four planes of the form i-n(cc : n : 1), only half are present ; viz., one of each pair in the manner indicated by shading in f. 91, these being extended while the others are suppressed, the solids in f. 92 and f. 93 result. The parallelism of each pair of opposite planes will be seen in these figures. These two possible forms, seen in the figures, are distinguished by calling one plus (arbitrarily), + *J[_-2], and the other minus,\u2014^[.-2]. These solids are very common in the species pyrite, and are hence called pyritohe drons ; they are also called pentagonal dodecahedrons, in allusion to their pentagonal faces. The regular dodecahedron of geometry belongs to this class, but is an impossible form in nature, since for it ._ must have an irra tional value, viz., \u2014 - \u2014 , see p. 10. __ In combination with the cube the form +-1[.-2] is seen in f. 94 and f. 95, and in f. 96, 97, with the octahedron, and in f. 98, with the cube and octa hedron. I Parallel hemi-hexoctahedron, \\[m : n: 1]. When of the forty-eight planes of the form m-n, only half are present, viz., the three alternate planes in each octant as indicated by the shading in f. 99, the solid in f. 100 results. This solid is called a,d iploi d by Haidinger. It is also called"], [42, "24 CRY STALLOGR APH Y. a dyakis-dodecahedron. In f. 101 it is shown in combination with the cube, and in f. 102 with the octahedron. Figs. 103, 104, 105, of the species pyrite, represent various combina tions of parallel hemihedrons with the cubic and other faces. In f. 103 there are planes of two hemi-tetrahexahedrons (pentagonal dodecahedrons) i-2, i-\\ ; and of two diploids 4-2, 3-f, along with planes of the octahedron, 1, and of the trapezohedron 2-2. In f. 104 the dominant form is the dode cahedron, /; it has the faces of the cube, H; of the octahedron, 1 ; of the trapezohedron, 2-2; and of the parallel hemihedrons, i-2 and 4-2. Fig. 105 represents a map of one angle of a cube, showing at centre the octahe dral face 1, and around it the faces of the cube H, of the trapezohedron 2-2, the trigonal trisoctahedron 2, and the parallel hemihedrons, i-2, 2-4, 3-f. The axial ratio for 2-f is 2 : -f : 1 (or 6:4:2), and for 3-1, 3 : f : 1 (or 6 : 3 : 2). Prominent distinctive characters. \u2014 The student, in order to facilitate his study of Isometric forms in nature, should be thoroughly familiar with the following points, from the study of models or natural crystals ; (1) The isometric character of the symmetry, the planes being alike in grouping in the direction of the three axes. (2) The forms of the faces and solid an gles of the octahedron, the dodecahedron, the trapezohedron 2-2, the pen tagonal dodecahedron i-2. (3) The fact that the following are common an gles in the system\u2014 135\u00b0 (=Ha\u00bb); 109\u00b0 28' (angle of octahedron), 70\u00b0 32' (angle in octahedron and tetrahedron) ; 120\u00b0 (angle of dodecahedron); 125\u00b0 16'(=HAl); 144\u00b0 44' (=Ha2-2= lt\\i); 153\u00b0 26'' (=Ha*-2) ; 161\u00b0 34' (=H A*-3). A list of the angles belonging to the various forms of this system is given on p. 67. (4) Cleavage may be cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral ; and sometimes two of these kinds, and occasionally the three, occur in the same species, but always with great difference of facility between them. Galenite is an example of easy cubic cleavage ; fluorite of easy octahedral ; sphalerite (blende) of easy dodecahedral. Planes of symmetry. \u2014 The seven kinds of solids described on pp. 15 to 19, include all the holohedral forms possible in this system, as is evident from their geometrical development. In them exists the highest degree of sym metry possible in any geometrical solids. In the cube, as has already been stated, all planes, solid angles, and edo-es are equal and similar. The three diametral planes, passing each through two of the axes, are the chief planes of symmetry, every part of the crystal"], [43, "25 TETRAGONAL SYSTEM. on one side of the plane having its equal and symmetrical part on the oppo site side. Further than this, each of the six planes passing through the diagonal edges of the cube, and consequently parallel to the dodecahedral planes, are also planes of symmetry. There are hence in this system nine planes of symmetry. II.\u2014 TETRAGONAL SYSTEM. In the Tetragonal System, there are three rectangular axes ; but while the two lateral axes are equal, the remaining vertical axis is either longer or shorter than they are ; there are consequently to be considered the lateral axes (a) and the vertical axis (c). The general geometrical expression for the planes of crystals becomes for this system me : na : a, and, if this be developed in the same way as the cor responding expression in the Isometric system, all the forms* geometrically possible are derived. 1. me : na : a [m-n] \u201e j c : a : a [1] | me : a : a [m] o j c : co a : a [1-i] \u00b0' | me : co \u00ab : a [m-i] 4. co c : na : a [i-n] 5. co c : a : a [I] 6. oo c : co a : a [i-i] h j (c : oo a : <x> a) [0] \\ or Oc :.a : a. when m >1, n>l. when w. = l, n=l. when m^l, n=l. when ;/_ = l, .i=co . when wt< 1, ra=oo . when m=oo , ._ >1. when m=co , .. = 1. when .71=00 , n\u2014co when m=Q, n=l. In lettering the planes the abridged symbols are used; here, as before, i=co , and the unit term is omitted as unnecessary, me : cca : a-\u2014 m-i, etc. These are the same as the symbols of Naumann, except that he wrote oo , and added P as the sign of the systems which are not isometric; OP\u2014O; oo Pec \u2014 i-i; ccP\u2014I; co Pn=i-n ; mPco =m-i ; mP=m ; P\u2014 1; and mPn=m-n. A. Holohedral Forms. Basal plane. \u2014 There are two similar planes corresponding to the sym bol c : ooa : <x>a (or Oc : a : a), parallel to both the lateral axes ; each is called the basal plane. They do not inclose a space, and consequently they can occur only in combination with other planes. Prisms. \u2014 The planes having the symbol co c : oo a : a are parallel to the vertical and one of the lateral axes. There are four such planes, one at each extremity of the two lateral axes, and, in combination with the plane 0, they form the square prism, which has been called the diametral prism, seen in f. 106. For the symbol oo a : a : a, the planes are parallel to the vertical axis, * The word form has been freely used in the preceding pages ; from this point on. how ever, it needs to be more exactly defined. In a crystallographic sense it includes all the planes geometrically possible, never less than two, which have the same general symbol."], [44, "26 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. and meet the others at equal distances. There are. as in the preceding case, four such planes. They form, in combination with the plane O, that square prism which is seen in f. 107, and may be called the unit prism. Both the prisms i-i and I are alike in their degree of symmetry. Each has four similar vertical edges, and eight similar basal edges unlike the vertical. There are also in each case eight similar solid angles. The form i-n (co c : na: a) is another prism, but in this each plane meets one of the lateral axes at the unit distance, and the other at some multiple of its unit distance. As is evident iu the accompanying horizontal section (f. 113), this general symbol requires eight similar planes, two in each quadrant, and the complete form is shown in f. 109. The sixteen basal edges are all similar; the vertical edges are of two kinds, four axial X, and four diagonal Y (f. 109). The regular octagonal pyramid with eight similar vertical edges, each angle being 135\u00b0, is crystallographically impossible. Ill 112 The planes I truncate the edges of the diametral prism i-i, as in f. 108. Similarly the planes i-i truncate the vertical edges of /. The prism i-n be vels the edges of i-i, as in f. 110, where i-n=i-2. The relation of the two square prisms, i-i and 7\", may be further illus trated by the figs. Ill and 112. In f. 112 the sections of the two prisms are shown with the dotted lines for the axes, and in f. Ill there are the two forms complete, the one (7) within the other (i-i). The unit prism /is sometimescalled the prism of the first series, and the prism i-i that of the second series. Octahedrons or Pyramids. \u2014 The forms m-i and m both give rise to square octahedrons, corresponding to the two kinds of square prisms. In m-i the planes are parallel to one lateral axis and meet the vertical axis at variable distances, multiples (denoted by in) of the unit length. The total number of such planes, for a given value of in, is obviously eight, and"], [45, "27 TETRAGONAL SYSTEM. the form is shown in f. 114 and 115. These planes replace the basal edges of the form shown in f. 106, and m varies in value from 0 to co . When m=0 the four planes above and below coincide with the two basal planes ; as m increases, there arises a series, or zone, of planes, with mu tually parallel intersections (f. 116) ; and when m\u2014aa , the octahedral planes m-i coincide with the planes i-i. The value of m in a particular species depends upon the unit value assumed for the vertical axis c. The same form replaces the vertical angles of the prism I, as in f. 117. The octahedrons of the in series meet both of the lateral axes at equal distances and the vertical axis at variable distances. It is clear that the whole number of planes for this form, when the value of mis given, is also eight, one in each octant. When m = l the solid iu f. IIS is obtained, which is sometimes called the unit octahedron. As m decreases, the octahe drons become more aud more obtuse, till m = 0, when the eight planes coin cide with the two basal planes. As m increases from unity, on the other hand, the octahedrons or pyramids become more and more acute, and when m\u2014\u00b0o they coincide with the prism /; this series forms another zone of planes. These octahedrons replace the basal edges in the form f. 107, as seen in f. 119, and as the octahedron is more and more developed it passes to f . 120, and finally to f . 118. The same form replaces the solid angles of the form f. 106, as seen in f. 121 and this too gradually passes into f. 122 and f. 114."], [46, "28 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The relation of the octahedrons 1 and 1-i (m and m-i) is the same as that of the prisms I and i-i (compare f. 112). Similarly, too, they are often called octahedrons (or pyramids) of the first (m) and second (m-i) series. As will be seen in f. 123, 1-i truncates the pyramidal edges of the octahe dron 1, and, conversely, the edges of the octahedron 2-i are truncated by the octahedron 1 (f. 124). Octagonal pyramids. \u2014 The form m-n (me : na : a) in this svstem has, as in the nrecedino- svs- 125 na : a) in this system has, as in the preceding sys tem, the highest number of similar planes which are geometrically possible ; in this case the num ber is obviously sixteen, two in each of the eight sectants, as in f. 125, where m=l, n\u20142. These sixteen similar planes together form the octagonal pyramid (strictly double pyramid) or zirconoid, f. 126. It has two kinds of terminal edges, the axial X and the diagonal Y ; the basal edtres are all similar. It is seen (...-.. = 1-2) in f. 127 in combination with the diametral prism, and in f. 128 with 1, where it bevels the vertical edges. 128 Other tetragonal forms are illustrated in figures 2 to 8, of zircon crystals, on p. 2 ; f. S is the most complex, and besides 3-3 shows also the related zirconoids 4-4 and 5-5. Several series of forms occur in f. 129, of vesuvianite. In the unit series of planes there are the octahedrons (or pyramids) 1, 2, 3, and the prism I ; in the diametral series 1-i, i-i ; of octagonal prisms, i-2, i-3 ; of zir conoids 2-2, 3-3, 5-5, 4-2, f-3, the whole num ber of planes being 154. B. Hemihedral Forms. Among hemihedral forms there are two divisions, as in the isometric system : 1. Hemiholohedral, having the full number of planes in half the sectants. (a) Vertically-alternate, or sphenoidal forms. \u2014 The planes occur in two sectants situated in a diagonal line at one extremity, and two in the trans verse diagonal at the other."], [47, "29 TETRAGONAL SYSTEM. With octahedral planes \\(mc : a : a) the solid is a tetrahedron (f. 130, 131) called a sphenoid, having the same relation to the square prism of 130 131 132 133 134 f. 106 that the regular tetrahedron has to the cube. Fig. 130 is the positive sphenoid or +1, and 131 the negative, or \u20141. The form %(mc : <x>a : a) is similar. Fig. 132 represents the sphenoid in combination with the prism i-i. If the planes of each sectant are the two of the octagonal pyramid i(mc : na : a) (f. 126), the form is a diploid (f. 133). It is in combination with the octahedron 1-i in f. 134. (b) Verticctlly-direct, or the planes occuring in two opposite sectants above, and in two on the same diagonal below. The result is a horizontal prism, or forms resembling those of the orthorhombic system. Character izes crystals of edingtonite. (e) Vertically-oblique. Planes occurring in two adjacent octants above, and in two diagonally opposite below, producing monoclinic forms, as in a hydrous ammonium sulphate. 2. Holohemihedral , all the sectants having half the full number of planes. As the largest number of planes of a kind is two, half the full number is in all cases one. Hemihedrism may occur in the forms m-n (f. 126, 127), or zirconoids, and in the forms i-n (f. 109), or the octagonal prism. The following are the kinds : (a) Vertically-direct. The occurring plane of the sectants, the right one in the upper series, and that in the same vertical zone below, as indi cated by the shading in f. 135 ; or else the left one above, and that in the same vertical zone below, f. 136. 135 i:.fi 137 138 139 (b) Vertically-alternate. The occurring plane the right above, and that in the alternate zone below, as indicated in f. 137 ; or else the left above, and that in the alternate zone below, f. 138. As the right of the two planes above is in the same vertical zone with the left of the two below (supposing the lower end made the upper), the two kinds of the first division will be the rl m-n ; and the Ir m-n (in f. 136 on the angles of the prism i-i) ; and the two of the second division the rr m-n and the 11 m-n (in f. 138, on the angles of the prism i-i)."], [48, "30 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The completed form for the first methods has parallel faces, and is like the ordinary square octahedron in shape, because the upper and lower planes belong to the same vertical zone. But in the second it is gyroidal ; the upper pyramid has its faces in the same vertical line with an edge of the lower, as represented in f. 139, the form 11 m-n. The first of these methods occurs in octagonal prisms, producing a square prism, either r i-n, or I i-n. Fig. 140 represents a com- 140 141 bination of the octahedron 1-i with the unit-octahedron 1, and two hemihedral forms, one of them Ir 1-2, the other rl 3-3. The plane 1 shows the posi tion of the octant ; 3-3 is to the right of 1, and 1-2 to the left. In f. 141, which is a top view of a crystal of wernerite, there occurs . 3-3 laree, along with r 3-3 small, indicating hemihedrism, and, judging from that of the allied species sarcolite, it is of the square oc tahedral kind, rl 3 3 and Ir 3-3, Wernerite.

Variable elements in this system. \u2014 In the tetragonal system two ele ments are variable, and in any given case must be decided before the rela tions of the forms can be definitely expressed. (a) The position of the lateral axes. \u2014 These axes are equal, but there are two possible positions for them, for in a given square octahedron they may be either diagonal or diametral ; in other words, given an octahedron, as in f. 115, 116, the prismatic planes may be made diametral (i-i), and the octahe dron so belong to the m-i series, or the prismatic planes may be made diag onal, that is I (oo c : a : a), when the corresponding octahedrons belong to the m series. The ratio of the lateral axes for the two cases is obviously 1 :V2, or 1 : 1.4142 +. (b) The length of the vertical axis. \u2014 Among the several occurring octa hedrons, one must be assumed as the unit, and the others referred to it. In f. 143, of zircon, the octahedron 1 is made the unit, and bv measur- ing the basal angle it is found mathematically, as explained later, that the length of the vertical axis is 0.85 times that of the lateral axes. The octahedron 3 has then the symbol 3c : a : a as referred to this unit. If the latter octahedron had been taken as the fun damental form, the length of the vertical axis would have been 3x0.85 times that of the lateral axes, and the symbol of the first plane would have been \\c : a : a. Which form is to be taken as the unit or fundamental, that is, what length of the vertical axis c is to be adopted, depends upon various considerations. In general that form is"], [49, "HEXAGONAL SYSTEM. 31 assumed as fundamental which is of most common occurrence or to which the cleavage is parallel ; or which best shows the morphological relations of the given species to others related to it in chemical composition, or which gives the simplest symbols for the occurring forms of a species. Prominent characteristics of ordinary tetragonal forms. \u2014 The promi nent distinguishing characteristics of tetragonal forms are : (1) A symme trical arrangement of the planes in fours or eights. (2) The frequent oc currence of a square prism diagonal to a square prism, the one making with the other an angle of 135\u00b0. (3) The occurrence of bevelling planes on the lateral edges of the square prism. (4) A resemblance of the octahedrons to the regular octahedron, in having a square base, but a dissimilarity in that the angles over the basal edges do not equal those over the terminal. (5) Cleavage maybe either basal, square-prismatic, or octahedral; prismatic cleavage, when existing, is alike in two directions, parallel to the lateral faces of one of the square prisms, and is always dissimilar to the basal cleav age; the basal, or the lateral, is sometimes indistinct or wanting; the pris matic may occur parallel to the lateral planes of both square j.risms, but when so, that of one will be always unlike in facility that of the other. Planes of symmetry. \u2014 There are five planes of symmetry in the tetra gonal system : one principal plane of symmetry normal to the vertical axis, and four others, intersecting in this axis ; these four are in two pairs, the planes of each pair normal (90\u00b0) to each other, and diagonal (45\u00b0) to those of the other. III.\u2014 HEXAGONAL SYSTEM. The Hexagonal System includes two grand divisions : 1. The Hexa gonal proper, in which (1) symmetry is by sixes, and multiples of six ; (2) hemihedral forms are of the kind called vertically-direct ; and (3) cleavage and all physical characters have direct relations to the holohedral hexagonal form. 2. The Rhombohedral, in which (1) symmetiT is by threes and multi ples of three, rhombohedral forms being hemihedral in mathematical rela tion to the hexagonal system, and of the kind called vertically-alternate ; (2) cleavage, and many other physical characters, usually partake of the hemihedrism. While the rhombohedron is mathematically a hemihedral form under the hexagonal system, and is properly so treated in a system of mathema tical crystallography, it is not so genetically, or in its fundamental relations. Moreover, it has its own hemihedral forms, which, under the broad hexago nal system, are tetartohedral. The holohedral forms, all of which belong to the Hexagonal division, are here first described ; and then the hemihedral forms, which include, be sides a few under the hexagonal division, the whole of the Rhombohedral division. A. Holohedral Forms : Hexagonal Division, The general expression for planes of this system is me : na : a : pa, where there are to be considered the vertical axis, c, and three equal lateral axes, a"], [50, "32 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. It is evident, however, that the position of any plane is determined by its intersections with two of the lateral axes, as its direction with the third follows directly from them. (Compare f. 146.) Consequently, in writing the symbol of any plane it is necessary to take into consideration only the vertical axis, and two of the lateral axes adjacent to each other. The various holohedral forms possible in this system are derived after the analogy of those of the tetragonal system. The parameters for all the lateral axes are given below for sake of comparison. It is to be noted here that ... may be either < 1, or > 1 ; n is always > 1 and < 2, whiles > 2 and< oo ; further than this it is alwavs true that \u00bb___ J J n-1 Qc:a:a: (a) [0] coc : a : a : (aoa) [I] oo c : 2a : a : (2a) [i-2] oo c : na : a : (pa) [i-n] \\ e : a: a: (co a) [1] [ me : a : a : (ooa) [m] me : 2a : a : (2a) .

The abridged symbols need no explanation beyond that which has been given on p. 25 ; mPn\u2014m-n ; oo Pn=i-n, etc. Basal planes. \u2014 The form O=0c : a : a includes the two basal planes above and below, parallel to the plane of the lateral axes. Prisms. \u2014 The form I=coc: a : a comprises the six planes parallel to the vertical axis, and meeting the two adjoining lateral axes at equal dis tances. These six planes with the basal plane form the hexagonal unit prism, f. 114. The form i-2=x c : 2a : a includes the six planes which are parallel to the vertical axis bnt meet one of the lateral axes at the unit distance, and the other two at double that distance. These planes with the basal plane form the diagonal prism, f. 145. The relations of the two prisms / and i-2 is shown in f. 146. In f. 147, it will be seen that the one prism truncates the vertical edges of the other. The faces of the i-2 make an angle of 150\u00b0 with the faces of /. \u2022 These two prisms have an inti mate connection with each other, and together form a regular twelve-sided prism\u2014 a prism which is crystallographically impossible except as the result of the combination of these two different forms."], [51, "HEXAGONAL SYSTEM. 33 The form i-2 is a special case of the general form i-n or oo c : na : a. When .. is some number less than 2, and greater than 1, there must be twa planes answering the given conditions in each sectant, and twelve in all. Together they form the dihexagonal, or twelve -sided, prism. This prism bevels the edges of the prism I, and the vertical edges are of two kinds, axial and diagonal. The values of n must lie between 1 and 2 ; some of the occurring forms are i-^, i-%, etc. Hexagonal pyramids, or Quartzoids. \u2014 The symbol l=c : a : a belongs to the twelve planes of the unit pyramid, f. 148, while the general form m \u2014 mc : a : a includes all the pyramids in this series where the length of the vertical axis is some multiple of the assumed unit length. As in the tetragonal system, when in diminishes, the pyramids become more and more obtuse, and the form passes into the basal plane when m is zero ; while as in increases, the pyramids become more and more acute, and finally coincide with the prism /. These pyramids consequently replace the basal edges between 0 and I, f . 149, and with them form a vertical zone of planes. The pyramids of the m-2 series have the same relation to those of the m series, just described, that the prism i-2 has to the prism I. They replace the basal edges between i-2 and 0 (f. 145), and as the value of m varies, give rise to a series or zone of planes between these limits. The pyramids of both the first (in) and the second (m-2) series are well shown iu f. 150, of apatite. In the first series there are the pyramids -J*, 1, and 2 ; and in the second series the pyramids 1-2, 2-2, and 4-2. The cor- responding prisms /and i-2 are also shown, and the zones between each of them and the basal plane 0 are to be noticed. Attention may also be called to the fact, exemplified here, that the pyramid 2-2 truncates the ver tical edges of the pyramid 2 ; also 1-2 truncates the vertical edges of 1 ; while the latter form (1) also truncates the vertical edges of -\u00a7--2, as is seen in f . 147. Dihexagonal pyramids, or Berylloids. \u2014 The general form me : net : a gives the largest number of similar planes possible in this system, which is here obviously twenty-four, that is, two in each of the twelve sectants. These pyramids correspond to the prisms of the i-n series, and form the dihexagonal pyramids, or berylloids, as in f. 151. The berylloid has three kinds of edges : the axial edges __T(f. 151, 152), connecting the apex with the extremity of one of the axes ; the diagonal edges Y, and the basal edges Z. 3"], [52, "34 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. In the upper pyramid, one of these two planes for each sectant may be distinguished as the right, and the other the left, as lettered in f. 152 ; and the same, after inverting the crystal, for those of the other pyramid. It is to be observed that in a given position of the form, as that of f. 151, the right of the upper pyramid will be over the left of the lower pyramid, and the reverse. Fig. 153 represents the planes of such a form m-n combined with the unit prism /, and the planes are lettered I, r, in accordance with the above. In f. 154, of a crystal of beryl, the prism I is combined with the pyramids 1, 2, 2-2, and the berylloid 3-f. B. Hemihedral Forms. I. Vertically Direct. \u2014 The planes of the upper range of sectants being in the same vertical zone severally with those below. (A). Hemiholohedral. \u2014 Half the sectants having the full number of planes : 1. Trigonal pyramids. \u2014 The diametral pyramid m-2 is some times thus hemihedral, as in the annexed figure (f. 155) of a crys tal of quartz, in which there are only three planes, 2-2 at each extremity, and each of those above is in the same zone with one below. The completed form would be an equilateral aud symme trical double three-sided pyramid. 2. Trigonal prisms. \u2014 The occurrence of three out of the six planes of the prism /, or i-2, produces a three-sided prism. The prism 1 is thus hemihedral in tourmaline (f. 156, a top view of a crystal), and the prism i-2 in quartz. Both these forms properly belong to the Khombo hedral division. 3. D it rigonal prisms. \u2014 An hexagonal prism hemihedral to the dihexago nal prism occurs in quartz and tourmaline, the hexagonal prism sometimes having only the alternate vertical edges bevelled, as in f. 183, and f. 185, p. 40. (__?). Holohemihedral. \u2014 All the sectants having half the full number of planes : 1. Hemi-dihexagonal pyramids. \u2014 Each sectant has one out of the two planes of the dihexagonal pyramid (f. 151, 153) ; this is indicated by"], [53, "35 hexagonal system. the shading in f. 157. The occurring plane may be the right above and left below, or left above and right below, and the form accordingly 157 1 ' Tourmaline. Apatite. either rl m-n, or Ir m-n. Examples of the first of these occur in f. 158, representing a crystal of apatite, the planes o(3-f), and o'(4--f) being of this kind. This method of hemihedrism occurs only in forms that are true hexagonal, and not in the rhombohedral division. II. Vertically alternate, the planes of the upper range of sectants being in zones alternate with those below. (A) He mi holohedral forms, or those in which half the sectants have the full number of planes as in the Rhombohedral Division. 1. Rhombohedron s, and their relation to Hexagonal forms. \u2014 The rhom bohedron is derivable from the hexagonal pyramid by a suppression of the alternate planes and the extension of the others. In f. 159, if the shaded planes in front and the opposite ones behind are suppressed, while the others are extended, a rhombohedron will be derived. This is further shown in f. 160, where the hexagonal pyramid is represented within the rhom bohedron. Another similar rhombohedron, complementary to this, would result from the suppression of the other alternate half of the planes. One of these rhombohedrons is called minus, and the other plus (f. 161, 162). The form in f. 148 is made up, under the rhombohedral system, of +__? and \u2014 R (or +1 and \u20141) combined, as in the annexed figure (f. 163), of a crystal of quartz. 159 160 161 162 Fig. 164 shows the combination of the rhombohedron with the prism I; in f. 165 the former is more developed, and it finally passes into the com-"], [54, "36 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. plete rhombohedron, f. 161. In f. 166 the rhombohedral planes occur on the alternate angles of the diagonal prism i-2. The symbol of the unit rhombohedron as referred to the hexagonal sys tem is i(c: a: a), a second rhombohedron may be \u00a3(2e :a : a) and so on ; it is, however, more simple to write only +R or \u2014 R, and +2R or \u2014 2R, and so on ; or, where there is no confusion with the symbols of hexagonal forms, as -fl, \u2014 1, and +m, \u2014m. 163 164 165 166 This hemihedrism resulting in the rhombohedron is analogous, in the alternate positions of the planes above and below, to that producing the tetrahedron in the isometric system. But owing to the fact that there are three lateral axes instead of two, the rhombohedron has its opposite faces parallel, unlike the tetrahedron In f. 167 the planes R belong to the rhombohedron +1 ; \u2022\u00a7 to the rhombohedron +-\u00a7\u25a0, having the verti tical axis \u00a7c ; 0 is the basal plane, or mathematically the rhombohe dron 0, the vertical axis being Oc. / is the hexagonal prism oo : 1 : 1, or more properly a rhom bohedron with an infinite axis, coo. On the opposite side of I the planes are rhombohedral, but belong to the minus series ; \u2014 -\u00a7 has the vertical axisfc; \u20144,4c; \u20142, 2c; \u2014 f, so, this last being complementary to Calcite. -ff, and the same identical form, except that all the parts 169 are reversed. Fig. 168, __!-___' represent different rhombo hedrons of the species calcite: A, the rhombohedron 1; B, \u2014\\; C, \u20142 ; D, \u2014 \u00a3\u25a0 ; E, 4 ; having respectively for the vertical axis, lc, \u00a7e, 2c, fc, 1c, with c=0.8543, the lat eral axes being made equal to unity. In f. 169 the rhombohedron 2 (or 211) is combined with \u20141 (or \u2014 B), the latter truncating the terminal edges of the former. In relation to the series of + and \u2014 rhombohedrons it is important to note that, since the position of \u2014 &R is that of the vertical edge of +R, in combination with it, it truncates these edges. Similarly +\\R truncates the same edges of \u2014^R, and so on."], [55, "37 HEXAGONAL SYSTEM. Also +R truncates the edges of -27?, and -R the edges of + 27? (f. 169), \u2014 27? truncates the edges'of +47?, and so on. 2. Scalenohedrons ; forms hemihedral to the dihexagonal pyramid. \u2014 As the rhombohedron is a hemihedral hexagonal pyramid or qnartzoid, so a scalenohedron is a hemihedral dihexagonal pyramid or berylloid. The method of hemihedrism is similar by the suppression of the planes of the alternate sectants, as indicated by the shading in f . 170 (analogous to f. 159) and the extension of those of the other sectants. A scalenohedron is 170 171 172 173 174 represented in f. 171, a hexagonal double pyramid with a zig-zag basal out line, and three kinds of edges ; the shorter terminal edge X, connecting the apex with the extremity of a lateral axis ; the longer terminal edge Y, intermediate in position; and the basal edge Z ; X and _Fcorrespond to X and Ym f. 151,152. There are plus and minus scalenohedrons, as there &replus and minus rhombohedrons. The relations of the form to replacements of the rhom- 175 bohedron are illustrated in the other figures. Fig. 172 repre sents a rhombohedron (+1 or 7?) with its basal edges bevel led ; and this bevelment, continued to the obliteration of the planes 7?, produces the scalenohedron shown by the dotted lines. The scalenohedron in f. 171, 172 has the vertical axis equal to 3c, or three times as long as that of R, the lateral axes of both being equal ; and hence it is that the planes are lettered I3, the 1 referring to the rhombohedron and the index3 being the multiple that gives the value of the vertical axis of the scalenohedron. In f. 173 there are two scalenohedrons of the same series, viz., I6, Is, combined with the rhombohedrons 7? (or +1) and + 4. Fig. 174 shows the scalenohedron \u2014 Is combined with the rhombohedron \u20144 (or \u201447?); and 175, the same with the rhombohe* dron 5 ( + 5R). Other scalenohedrons replace the basal angles of a rhombohedron by two similar planes (f. 1 76) ; or bevel the terminal edges ; or replace the terminal solid angles by six planes, two to each terminal edge, or to each"], [56, "38 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. rhombohedral face ; and they will be relatively + or -, according to their position in one or the other set of sectants, as has been explained. Fig. 177 represents the top view of a crystal of tourmaline. It contains the rhombo- 176 Tourmaline. hedral planes, 7?, f, -V1-, \u2014 \\,\u2014 \\, \u2014\\, \u20142, along with the scalenohedrons \u2014 i\\ \u2014%*, \u2014 _*b, If, I2, and also two others bevelling the terminal edges of the rhombohedron 7?. The scalenohedrons \u2014 42, \u2014 \u25a0_', -\u2014- }5, bevel the basal edges of the rhombohedron \u2014 | ; and consequently the length of the axes are respectively 2, 3, 5 times that of the rhombohedron i, and hence, equal lc, fe, Jc. Every scalenohedron corresponds to a bevelment of the basal edges of some rhombohedron \u2014 and that particular one whose lateral edges are parallel to those of the scalenohedron. The symbols for them accordingly are made up of the symbol of the rhombohedron and an index which expresses the relation of its vertical axis as to length to that of the rhombohedron, according to a method proposed by Saumann. (See p. 72.) ...q Hexagonal pyramids of the m-2 or diagonal series occur in many7 rhombohedral species ; as f. 17S of corundum, which contains f-2(. \u25a0), 4-2, -^--2 (for 9-2 on the figure read -s8-2, Klein), along with the rhombohedron 1, and the basal plane 0 ; also f. 167, in which is the pyramid 2-2. Hemihedral forms of the same pyramids (of the kind described on p. 34) are met with in rhombohedral species, but only such as have also tetartohedral modifications. Hemihedral forms of the hexagonal and dihex- Corundum. ag0na] piisms (p. 34) are also characteristic of some rhombohedral species, and of those that have either tetartohedral or hemimorphic modifi cations. Fig. 179 illustrates the relative positions of the zones of the -+- and \u2014 rhombohedrons, and diagonal pyramids m-2 alternating with regions of + and \u2014 scalenohedrons in the scheme of the rhombohedral system. The figure is supposed to be a top view. It is similar to f. 152, p. 34, and like that contains the upper planes of the dihexagonal pyramid ; but these are divided between a plus and a minus scalenohedron, those planes marked + being the former, and the others (\u2014 ) the latter. The three lateral axes are lettered each lib. The posi tion of the + mR zone of planes (or plus rhombohedrons) relative to the scalenohedrons is shown by the lettering +R; of the \u2014mR zones (oi minus rhombohedrons) by \u2014R. The position of the vertical zone of m-2, or diametral pyramidal planes, is indicated by the letter d. The order of succession, beginning 179 with one of the plus interaxial sectants (the one in the medial line below; aud numbering it I, is as follows :"], [57, "39 HEXAGONAL SYSTEM. ( (1) Plus scalenohedrons, or planes of the general form +\u00ab.\". I. -J (2) Zone of plus rhombohedrons, -(-mR. ( (3) Plus scalenohedrons, or planes of the general form +m\". (4) Zone of diagonal pyramids, m-2. ( (5) Alinus scalenohedrons, or planes of the general form \u2014hi\". II. \u2022< (6) Zone of minus rhombohedrons, \u2014mR. ( (7) Minus scalenohedrons, \u2014m\". (8) Zone of diagonal pyramids, m-2. ( (9) Plus scalenohedrons, +mn. III. -! (10) Zone of plus rhombohedrons, +mR. ( (11) Plus scalenohedrons, + \u00bb.\". (12) Zone of diagonal pyramids. And so on around, as the figure illustrates. In the lower pyramid the order of succession is the same ; but the plus planes are directly below the minus of the above view of the upper pyramid. The plus scalenohedrons have the pyramidal edge over the +mR section, the more obtuse of the two (or edge Y) ; and the minus scalenohedrons have that edge the less obtuse (or edge ___), and that over the \u2014mB section the more obtuse (or edge T). B. Holohemihedral forms, or those in which all the sectants have half the full number of planes (as shown by the shading in f. 180). Gyroidal, or trapezohedral forms. \u2014 Of the planes, in f. 181 there would occur only those lettered r, .*, above and below ; or those lettered I, I, and, unlike f. 157, the planes above and below are not in the same zone. The form is consequently gyroidal, the planes being inclined around the prism, both above and below, and in the same direction at the two extremities. It is also called plagihedral. The symbol for the planes is rr m-n, or 11 m-n, according as the occurring planes of the two in the same sector are the right or the left. Fig. 182 is an example of 11 6-$- in the species quartz. C. Tetartohedral Forms. These forms are hemihedral to the Rhombohedron. (A) Ilolomorp/iic forms, like the preceding heniihedral, the planes occur ring equally in the upper and lower range of sectants. 1. R/iombohedral tetartohedrism. \u2014 Occurring planes the alternate of those mentioned on page 35, that is, the alternate planes r of one base, and I of the other. They are the r of three alternate sectants above, and"], [58, "40 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the I of three sectants below alternate with these. A form of this kind consists of six equal planes, equally spaced, aud hence, equal in inclina tions, and is therefore, in the completed state, a rhombohedron. It occurs in menaccanite or titanic iron, and in quartz (f. 183, planes 13~f\u00a7). 2. Gyroidal or trapezohedral tetartohedrism.\u2014 Occurring planes the alternate of those lettered r or . in f. 153, p. 34, that is, the alternate planes r, or alternate I, of both bases. Quartz. Quartz. In f. 185, the planes o\\ ov\\ oUi, olv, o\" (4-f, 5-f, 6-f, 8-f, 3-|, the first four right, the last left) are examples. The upper and lower of a kind adjoin the same diametral plane, but are on opposite sides of it, and therefore the three sectants containing planes below are alternate with the three above. The solid made of these six planes (f. 184) has trapezoidal faces, and is called a trigonotype by Naumann. The tetartohedral planes on quartz and cinnabar have a remarkable con nection with the circular polarization which is characteristic of them both, and which is further explained elsewhere (p. 138). (B) Hemimorphic forms ; the planes occurring either in the upper or the lower range of sectants and not in both. There are two kinds of forms : (1) the hemi-rhombohedron, and (2) the -oa hemi-scalenohedron. Fio-. 186 illustrates each of these 186 \u201e m, ~ r> \u25a0 ii -i j -i _ _i forms. The form 7? is properly hemihedral at the two extremities, its planes being very large at one, and quite small at the other. So with \u2014 &. Another rhom bohedron, \u20142, occurs only at the upper extremity. Again, \u00a3' is a hemi-scalenohedron, the upper six planes being present, but not the lower. The prism 7 in this figure is hemihedral, as explained on p. 34. It is not tetartohedral to the hexagonal system in the ordinary view. But since in a vertical zone +mR, co R, \u2014mR, the ooT? may be regarded as the infinite term of either the +mR series, or else the same of the \u2014mR series; and as this view accords with the tetartohedral character of the mR series in all such crystals, it might be ranked among tetartohedral forms. From the same point of view, the ditrigonal prisms in tourmaline and"], [59, "ORTHORHOMBIC SYSTEM. 41 quartz are tetartohedral, since they may be regarded as either plus or minus tetartohedral scalenohedrons, with an infinite vertical axis. Variable elements. \u2014 In the hexagonal system the same elements are vari able as in the tetragonal (see p. 30). In other words, the position of the vertical axis is fixed, but (1) a certain length must be assumed as the unit in a given species, and also (2) the position of the lateral axes must be fixed, for, as in f. 144, 145, either of the hexagonal prisms may be made / and the other i-2. The general characteristics of this system which the student must be acquainted with are : (1) The planes constantly occur in threes or sixes, or their multiples ; (2) The frequency of the angles 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 in the prismatic series ; (3) The rhombohedral cleavage, common in species be longing to the rhombohedral division. It is also important to note that many forms apparently hexagonal really belong to the orthorhombic system, being produced by twinning parallel to the vertical prism ; e.g., the appar ently hexagonal prisms of aragonite. The close relation of the two systems is spoken of elsewhere (p. 46). The planes of symmetry for the holohedral forms are analogous to those in the tetragonal system ; that is, one principal plane of symmetry normal to the vertical axis, and six others intersecting in this axis. These last belong to two sets, the planes of the one cutting each other at angles of 60\u00b0, and diagonal to those of the other. IV.\u2014 ORTHORHOMBIC SYSTEM. In the Orthorhombic system the three axes are unequal c, b, a; of these c is the vertical axis, b is made the longer of the two lateral axes, or the macrodiagonal axis, and a the shorter lateral, or brachydiagoned, axis.* The different occurring forms, deduced as before from the general ex- pression, are: j me : nb : a [m-ii] \\ me : b : net [m-ii] ( me : b : a [m] \\c:b:a [1] \\ me : oob : a [m-i] ( me : b : coa [m-i] co c : nb : a [i-n] co c : b : na [i-H] co c : b : a [I] oo c : oo b : a [i-i] oo c : b : co a [*.-_] Oc : b : a [O] The abridged symbols need very little explanation additional to that given on p. 25. As before, only the essential part of the symbol is given ; m is written first, and refers in all cases to the vertical axis (c), and n refers to one of the lateral axes, whether the longer (b) or the shorter (a) is indicated by the sign placed over it, as /. or h. When n = co , this is indicated by the i hitherto used, and the sign is placed over it, ., or i. with the same signi fication. These correspond to the symbols used by Naumann, as follows: 0 \u2014 OP; i-i= \u0153Pcc; .-. = *\u00bb Poo; co Pii=i-h; mP\u00a3>=m-i; mP=m; m-n=mP,i, etc. * For the relation of the axes thus lettered to those of Dana's System of Mineralogy and of other authors, see p. 53."], [60, "42 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. A. Holohedral Forms. Pinacoids. \u2014 The final case mentioned in the above enumeration em braces, as before, the two basal planes, or basal pinacoids ; the one pre ceding it includes the two planes parallel to the vertical and brachydiagonal axes (c and b), called the macropinacoids, and the third includes the two planes parallel to the vertical and brachydiagonal axes (c and a), called the brac/iypinacoids. These three sets of planes together form the solid in f. 1S8, which is called the diametral prism. In consequence of the ine quality of the different pairs of planes there are only four similar edges in any set ; thus four similar vertical edges ; four macrodiagonal basal edges, two above and two below, between O and i-i ; and similarly four brachy diagonal basal edges between 0 and i-i ; the eight solid angles are all similar. Prisms. \u2014The form co c : b : a, or 7, includes the four planes of the unit prism which, in combination with 0, is seen in f. 187. In this case the eight basal edges are similar, being made in each case by a similar pair of planes O and I. Of the vertical edges there are two pairs, those at theextremity of the axis a, which are obtuse, and those at the extremity of b, which are acute. Similarly, there are two sets of basal solid angles, four in each; for though each solid angle is formed by the meeting of the same three planes, the angles are different in the two cases, The form 7 replaces the four similar vertical edges of f. 18S ; the macro pinacoids i-i truncate the obtuse vertical edges of the prism I, and the brachypinacoids i-l truncate the acute vertical edges of 7, as shown in f. 189. There are two other series of prisms with symbols oo c : nb : a and oo c : b : na. In the latter series the axis b is made the unit; the reason for this will be obvious when the relations of the two forms are The prism I meets both axes a and b at their unit lengths, as in f. 187. If, now, the prismatic planes meet the longer lateral axis (b) at a greater distance, a prism is formed such as that in f. 190, whose symbol is i-2, or co c : 2b : a. This is a maerodiago nal prism ; and others might have 190 191 the symbols i-3 (oo c : 3b : a), i-i (\u00ab c : ib : a), and so on, or in general i-n. If .. becomes less than unity, the case shown in f. 191 arises, where the inner prism has n=\\, and the symbol is i-J (oo c : \u00a7b : a), still retaining a as the unit axis. For convenience of reference, however, the principle before explained (p. 11) is made use of, and the plane is called oo c : b : 2a, or i-i;"], [61, "43 ORTHORHOMBIC SYSTEM. these expressions and those before given being identical, except that in the latter case b is the unit axis. By this method the use of any fractions less than unity is avoided. The inner prism i-\\, indicated by dotted lines in f. 191, then becomes the outer prism or i-i. The prisms of the general form i-h, are called brachydiagonal prisms. The prisms i-h bevel the front and rear (obtuse) edges of the prism 7\", f. 192, and the prisms i-h bevel the side (acute) edges as in f. 193. Further, the former, i-n, replace the edges between i-i and 7 (f. 194), while the i-n prisms replace the edges between i-i and 7 (f. 194). This series of planes (f. 194), from i-i to i-i, is another example of a zone ; all the planes make parallel intersections with each other, being alike in that they are parallel to the vertical axis. Domes. \u2014 The form me : cob : a includes the four planes which are parallel to the macrodiagonal axis, and meet the vertical axis at variable distances, multiples of the unit length (see f. 34, p. 11). An example of them in combination with i-i, the brachypinaeoid, is shown in f. 195. These planes are called macrodomes (see also f . 196). The forms me : b : co a include four analogous planes, which differ in this respect, that they are parallel to the brachydiagonal axis, and are hence called brachydomes (see f. 35, p. 11). In this case, the longer lateral axis is taken as the unit. Fig. 197 shows two such brachydomes, 1-. aud 2-i, in combination with other forms. (See also f. 19.8.) The word dome, used here and above, is derived from Sopii], or domus, a house, the form resem bling the roof of a house. The combination of 1-i with 1-i is shown in f. 199, forming a retangular octahedron, and in f. 200 they are shown replacing the solid angles formed by 7\" and O, as in f. 188. As either of the three directions may be made the vertical, it is evident that these domes differ from vertical prisms only in position."], [62, "44 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The occurrence of these domes in combination with the other forms, 0, i-i, i-i, I, affords an illustration of the law of symmetry that all similar parts must be modified alike. Ihus m f. 199 200 188, as has been shown, there are two sets of solid angles, four in each ; one set is replaced by the four planes of the form m-i, and if one is, all must be ; and the other set (lateral) is replaced by the four planes of the form m-l, f. 200. Octahedron* (or Pyramids).\u2014 The sym- bol c : b : a (1) belongs to the unit octahedron (f. 201). It replaces the edges between the prism /and the basal plane O (f. 202). It also replaces 203 202 the eight similar solid angles of the diametral prism, as in f. 203. This is a special case of the form me : b : a, in which m may have values vary ing from 0 to oo . Fig. 208, of sulphur, shows a zone of such planes, of the general symbol me : b : a, with m=co for 7; also, m\u20141, m=i, m=\\, m\u2014\\, and finally m=0, for the basal plane O. The general form in this system, consisting of eight similar planes, may be written either me : nb : a (m-ii) or me :b : net (m-n). The relation be tween the two is the same as that between the prisms i-h and i-h. Thus, in f. 204, one plane of the octahedron 2c : 2b : a (2-2) is given, and also one plane of another octahedron or pyramid, whose symbol is 2c : b : a (2). If n becomes less than unity, as -J, the plane has the symbol 2c : \\b : a (2-J). In order to avoid this use of fractions the symbol is written 4c : b : 2a, that is, 4-2. The plane is shown in f. 205, in its two positions correspond ing to 2c : ib : a, and 4c : b : 2a, the two being crystallographically iden tical."], [63, "45 ORTHORHOMBIC SYSTEM. . Thus there are two scries of pyramidal planes : a macrodiagonal (m-n), where the shorter axis is taken as the unit, and a brachydiagonal (m-h), where the unit is the longer 208 lateral axis ; and between the two lie the unit octahedron (1) and those of the m series, just as the prism 7 lies between the prisms i-h and i-h. The macrodiagonal planes 1-2 and 2-2 are shown in f. 206 and f. 207. It is also seen in f. 207 that the planes 2-2, __-*, 2-2 all make parallel intersec tions with each other and with i-i, being an example of a zone where the ratios of the ver tical axes are the same. Further orthorhombic forms are displayed in f. 208, of sulphur, already referred to. The full symbol of the plane 1-3 is c:b :3a. Sulphur. B. Hemihedral Forms. The hemihedral forms that have been observed are of two kinds : 1, The vertically -oblique (p. 14), producing monoclinic forms; and 2, the hemimorphic. in which the planes of the octahedrons or domes of one base have no corresponding planes at the opposite extremity. The former kind is illustrated in f. 209, of the species chondrodite (var. humite, type III). Fig. 210 represents the holohedral form of the same ; the planes \u00a7-i, 1-i, 2-i, are of macrodomes ; \u25a0\u00a7-\u00a3, |-_, 4-*., of brachydomes ; and the others of various octahedrons, mostly7 in two vertical zones, the unit zone (me : b : a), and the 1 : 2 zone (ma : 2b : a). In f. 209 the alternate of the macro domes and of the octahedral planes of the 1 : 2 zone are absent in the upper half of the form, and are present without those with which they alternate in the lower half. The crystal consequently resembles one under the monoclinic system. Datrdite was formerly cited as a hemihedral orthorhombic species, but it has been found to be really monoclinic. Furthermore, it has been recently shown by the author, by reference to the optical properties, that the chon-"], [64, "46 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. drodite of the second and third types (see p. 305) is not orthorhombic but monoclinic, and this must be true also of humite.* Hemimorphic forms characterize the species topaz and calamine. The latter (in f. 211) has only the planes of a hemioctahedron at one extremity, and planes of hemidomes at the other. For the pyro-electric properties of such forms, see p. 165. Variable elements. \u2014 In the orthorhombic system the lengths of the three axes are variable, though their position is fixed, and after these are fixed the choice of one for the vertical axis must be arbitrarily made. In other words, given an orthorhombic crystal, the three rectangular directions are fixed, but two assumptions must be made which will mathematically deter mine the length of two of the axes in terms of the third. For instance, in a crystal, if certain occurring domes are adopted as the unit planes 1-i and 1-i, this will determine the relative lengths of the three axes, for which two measurements will be necessary ; or, if an occurring octahe dron is assumed as the unit octahedron (1,) this alone will obviously fix the axes ; but here, also, two independent measurements are necessary in order to enable us to calculate their length, as is explained later, p. 74. Hav ing determined upon the relative lengths of the axes, one of these must be made the vertical axis (c), and then, of the two remaining, the shorter will be the brachydiagonal (a), and the longer the macrodiagonal axis (b). In deciding these arbitrary points, the following serve as guides : The habit of the crystals ; the relations of the given species to those allied in composition; the cleavage, which is regarded as pointing to that form which is properly fundamental ; and other considerations. How arbitrary the choice generally is is well shown by the fact that, in a considerable number of species belonging to this system, different lengths of axes, as also different positions for them, have been adopted by different authors. \"Where an optical examination can be made of an orthorhombic crystal, the results show what the true position of the axes is, in accordance with the principles proposed by Schrauf. This subject is alluded to again in its proper place (p. 147). The general characteristics of the crystals of this system are not so marked as those of the preceding systems. The kind of symmetry should be well understood, though, as remarked on p. 50, crystals which are in appearance orthorhombic may be really monoclinic ; the true test of the system is to be found in the three rectangular axial directions. A pris matic habit is very common, the prisms (except the diametral prism) not being square, also the prominence of some of the most commonly occur ring macrodomes and brachydomes ; a prismatic cleavage is common, and often a cleavage exists parallel to one of the pinacoids (e.g., i-i) and not to the other, which could not be true in the tetragonal system ; similarly the planes i-i, i-i are sometimes physically different, e.g., in regard to lustre. As has already been remarked, forms apparently hexagonal are common among certain species belonging to this system ; this is true in those cases * Since the above paragraph was put into type, Des Cloizeaux has announced that an opti cal investigation by him has proved that humite crystals, of types II. and III., are really monoclinic, as suggested above. The figures are allowed to remain, however, since they illus trate the form which this method of hemihedrism icould produce."], [65, "MONOCLINIC SYSTEM. 47 where the prism has an angle approximating to 120\u00b0. It is immediately evident, as is explained more thoroughly in the chapter on compound crystals, that if three individual crystals are united each by a prismatic face, when the prismatic angle is near 120\u00b0, they will form together a six-sided prism, approximating more or less closely to a regular hexa gonal prism. Similarly, under the same circumstances, the correspond ing pyramids will thus together form a more or less symmetrical hexagonal pyramid. 11ns is illustrated by the accompanying figures of witherite, where the prismatic angle is 11S\u00b0, 30'. It need hardly be added that this is true in general, not only of the vertical prism, but also of a macrodome or brachydome, having an angle near 120\u00b0. The optical relations connected with this subject are alluded to elsewhere, p. 147. Planes of Symmetry. \u2014 The three diametral planes are planes of symmetry in this system, and they are the only ones. V.\u2014 MONOCLINIC SYSTEM. In the Monoclinic system the three axes are un equal in length, and while two of them have rectan gular intersections, the third is oblique. The positii >n usually adopted for these axes is as shown in f. 214, where the vertical axis, c, and lateral axis, b, make retangular intersections, The same is true of b and d, while c and d are oblique to one another. The following is an enumeration of the several distinct forms possible in this system, deduced, as be- 214 fore, from the general expression : j \u2014me : cob : a [\u2014m-i] ( +me : cob : a [-\\-m-i] j oo c : .**._> : __ [wi] j oo c : b : na (Y**1] oo c : b : a [/] oo c : co _i : a [i-i] co c : b : <x> a [i-i] Oc:b: a [6*] j \u2014me : nb : a \\_\u2014m-n\\ \\ +mc : nb : a [ + m-\u00bb] J \u2014me : b : m\u00ab [\u2014 m-h] \\ +mc : b : na [ 4- ?n-ii] J \u2014 //lo' : b : a [ \u2014 ?\u00ab.] l-c:b: a [-1] j +mc : -5 : \u00ab [ + m] [+c:i : a [ + 1] \u25a0*??_! : b : ooa [WiJ The abridged symbols correspond to those in the orthorhombic system, explained on p. 42. The only point to be noted is that where n or . relates to the clinodiagonal axis, a, this is indicated by an accent placed over it, as m-i, m-ii ; but in m-i, and m-n, etc., i and n refer to the orthodiagonal axis. Naumann wrote these mPaa , and mPii, or else with the accent across the initial letter P. The minus signs are used in the same way as by Naumann (see p. 76). Pinacoids. \u2014 As in the orthorhombic system, there are three pairs of pinacoidal planes : the base O\u20140c :b : a; the orthopinacoid, parallel to the"], [66, "48 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. ortho-axis (b) oo c : co b : a, or i-i ; and the clinopinacoid, parallel to the in clined axis (a), co c : b : oo a, or i-i. In the solid (f. 216) or diametral prism formed of these three pairs of planes, the four vertical edges are similar, and this is also true of the four edges between 0 and i-i. On the other hand, the four remaining edges are of two sets ; that is, the edge in front above is similar to the edge be- hind and below, for the angles are equal 215 216 and inclosed by similar planes; but these edges are not similar to the remainino* two, since, though the planes are the same, the inclosed angles are unequal to the former. Further, there are two sets of solid angles, two in front and two dia gonally opposite behind, being alike ob- tuse angles, and the other four alike and acute. Prisms. \u2014 In consequence of the similarity of the vertical edges of the diametral prism, they must all be replaced if one is ; this is done by the unit prism I (co c : b : a), in f. 215, 217. Of the other prisms, each obviously consist- ing of four planes, there are two series, the orthodiagonal, i-n, and clinodiagonal, i-h, bearing the same relation to each other as the macro- and brachy-diagonal prisms in the orthorhombic system, in fact, the same explanation may be made use of here. Fig. 217, of a crystal of datolite from Toggiana, shows the pinacoid planes, as also the unit prism, 7, and the clinodiagonal prism, i-2. Clinodomes. \u2014 The form m-i (me : b : <x>a) includes the four planes parallel to the clino- diagonal axis, and meeting the others at variable distances. They are analo gous to the brachydomes \"of the orthorhombic system. There are four of these planes, because the two axes, c and b, make rectangular intersections. This is also seen in f. 218, since, as has been remarked, the four clino diagonal edges in f. 215 are similar, and hence are simultaneously replaced by these clinodomes. Orthodomes. \u2014 Of the general form, me : co b : a, there are two sets of planes, two in each, both of which are alike in that they are parallel to the vertical (c) and orthodiagonal (b) axes (see f. 219). They are unlike, how ever, in that two are opposite an obtuse angle, and two opposite the acute angle. Consequently these two pairs of planes are distinct, and must occul"], [67, "49 monoclinic system. independently of each other. To distinguish between them, those belonging to the obtuse sectants receive the minus sign (\u2014m-i), and those belonging to the acute sectants the plus sign (-(-m-i), f. 219. This same point is illus trated by f. 220, where, as has been remarked, the obtuse edges, above in front, and below behind, are similar, and are hence replaced by planes of the \u2014m-i series, while the remaining two (f. 221), are also similar, and are replaced by +m-i planes. Hemi-octahedrons. \u2014 The same distinction of plus and minus belongs to all the pyramidal planes, and the signs are used in the same way. For each form there are only four similar planes. The m series is that of the unit octahedrons, \u2014 property hemi-octahe drons, or hemi-pyTamids +m and \u2014 m. The form made up of +1 and \u20141 is seen in f. 223, and in f. 222 the same planes are in combination with the three pinacoids. The general form, +m-n, \u2014m-n, and +m-h, \u2014m-n, give each four simi lar planes. They bear exactly the same relation to each other as the m-n and m-n of the orthorhombic system, so that no additional explanation is needed here in regard to them. The figure (f. 217) of datolite may be referred to for illustrations of the different forms which have been named. There are here three different clinodomes -f-., 24, and 4-*., each comprising four planes ; a minus hemi orthodome (opposite the obtuse angle), \u20142-i, and also a plus orthodomc, + 2-i (these two planes are quite distinct, though numerically the symbols are the same) ; moreover, of hemi-octahedrons of the unit series, there are \u20144, \u2014 f, and +4, +2, +|, + 1, + -|-, + f; also of orthodiagonal pyramids, \u20144-2, \u20146-3, also +2-2, and of clinodiagonal planes, \u2014 8-S, and + 12-\u00a7-. A cares ul study of a few such figures, especially with the help of models, will give the student a clear idea of the symmetry of this system. It will be noticed that all the planes above in front are repeated below behind, and those below in front appear again above behind. More important than this, it will be seen that the clinodiagonal diametral plane divides the crys tal into two symmetrical halves, right and left; in other words, as remarked later, it is a plane of symmetry. Hemihedral forms occur of a hemimorphic character, in which the planes about the opposite extremities of the orthodiagonal axis are unlike a plane of one or more hemi-pyramids occurring at one, without that corresponding at the other, as in tartaric acid, ammonium tartrate, etc. With many7 monoclinic crystals the obliquity is obvious at sight ; but with many others it is slight, and can be determined only by exact measurements. 4"], [68, "50 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. In datolite it is only six minutes. The character of the symmetry exhibits further the obliquity. But, as seen above, both + and \u2014 planes of the same value do occur together, and though they are really distinct yet they may give a monoclinic crystal the aspect of an orthorhombic crystal. On the other hand, true orthorhombic crystals may be hemihedral, and thus may be monoclinic in the character of the symmetry (p. 45). Variable elements. \u2014 In the monoclinic system, the only element which is fixed is the position of the orthodiagonal axis (b) at right angles to the plane in which the other axes must lie. The lengths of these axes must obviously be assumed in the same way as in the preceding system ; but, further than this, their position in the given plane, and the angle they make with each other, are both arbitrary ; in other words, any plane in the zone at right angles to the clinopinacoid may be taken as the base (0) and any other as the orthopinacoid (i-i). The existence of a prismatic cleavage, or one parallel to a plane in the orthodiagonal- zone often points to the planes which are really to be considered fundamental. In many cases it is considered desirable to assume an angle near 90\u00b0 as the angle of obliquity, so as to show the degree of divergence from the rectangular type. It need hardly be added that authorities differ widely both as to the position and lengths given to the axes of the same species. Plane of symmetry. \u2014 Monoclinic crystals have but one plane of sym metry, the diametral plane, in which the vertical and clinodiagonal axes lie, that is, the plane parallel to the clinopinacoids. The maximum num ber of similar planes for any form is four, and it will be noticed that there is no single form which alone can enclose a space, or form a geome trical solid. VI.\u2014 TRICLINIC SYSTEM. In the Triclinic system the three axes are unequal, and their intersections are mutually oblique. In consequence of this fact, there is no plane of symmetry. Only diagonally opposite octants are similar ; there can conse quently be only two planes of anyone kind. There are no truncations or bevelments, and no interfacial angles of 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0, or 120\u00b0. The prisms are all hemiprisms, and the octahedrons tetarto-octahedrons. The lateral axes are called the macrodiagonal (b), and the brachydiago nal (a). In f . 225 the diametral prism (made up of three pairs of different planes) is represented, and in f. 224 the unit prism. To the latter is added (in f. 226) one plane \u20141 on two diagonally opposite edges, which are two out of the eight of the unit octahedron (f. 227). This octahedron, as will"], [69, "MATHEMATICAL crystallography. 51 be seen, is made up of four sets of different planes. The different kinds of planes are distinguished by the long or short mark over the n (h or n) and also by giving those which occur in the right-hand octants, in front, an accent ; those above (in the obtuse octants) are minus, and the others plus. The form m-h consequently may be \u2014m-h' , or \u2014m-ii, +m-ii', or + m-h ; and similarly with m-h. In f. 228 the unit prism is combined with a hemidome and a vertical plane parallel to the brachydiagonal section. The forms, although oblique in every direction, may still be closely similar to monoclinic forms of related species. 229 Anorthite. Axinite. The annexed figures are of triclinic species. In f. 229, of anorthite, of the feldspar group, the form is very similar to those of the monoclinic feldspar, orthoclase ; in orthoclase, 0 on the brachydiagonal (clinodiagonal) section is 90\u00b0, whence it is monoclinic, while in anorthite this angle is 85\u00b0 50', or 4\u00b0 10' from 90\u00b0, and this is the principal source of the diversity of angle and form. ' Fig. 230 represents one of the crystalline forms of axinite, nearly all of which fail of any special monoclinic habit. MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Introductory remarks on the proper symbol of each plane of a gen-eral crystalline form. \u2014 Hitherto the symbol me : nb : a has been employed to express the general position of all the planes comprising any crystalline form, and it has been shown that there are in some cases forty-eight similar planes answering to the general symbol, and in other cases only two. In order, however, to express the exact position of each individual plane be longing to such a form, it becomes necessary to resort to the methods of analytical geometry. As shown in f. 231, the portions of the axes, when the centre is the starting point, which lie above, to the right, and in front of the centre, are called plus (+) ; the corresponding portions of the axes measured from the centre below, to the left, and behind, are called, for the"], [70, "52 crystallography. sake of distinction, minus (-). The planes of the first quadrant (see also f. 232) are all positive ( + ); the planes of the second positive (+) with reference to the axes c and a, but negative (-) with reference to b ; in the third, both lateral axes are negative (\u2014 ) ; in the fourth quadrant the planes are positive in regard to c and b, but negative with respect to a. The lower quadrants are respectively similar, except that the vertical axis is always negative. The symbols for each plane of the orthorhombic octahedron (f. 231), taken^ in the same order, will be as follows . Above, +c : +b : +a; +c : \u2014b : +a; +c : \u2014b : \u2014a; +c : +b : \u2014a. Below, \u2014 c : +b : +a; \u2014c:\u2014b:+a; \u2014c:\u2014b:\u2014a; \u2014c:+b: \u2014a. The hexoctahedron (ma : na : a) may be taken as another example. The general symbol of the form of f. 247, p. 64, is 3-f (3a : fa : a), but the symbol of each plane is distinct. The same principle applies here as in the other case. Several of the planes in f. 247 are numbered to allow of convenient reference to them as examples, the appropriate symbols are written below ; the order in the symbols is the same as that uniformly used in the work : 1st, the vertical axis (c) ; 2d, the lateral axis extending right and left (b) ; and 3d, the lateral axis, in front and behind (a). c b a c b a 1 = 3a : f a : a 6 = 3a : a : f a 2 = fa : 3a : a 7 = \u20143a : f a : a 3 = a : 3a : f a S = \u20143a : a:\\a 4 = a : f a : 3a 9 = \u00a7 a : \u20143a : a 5 = fa : a : 3a 10 = \u20143a : \u2014fa : a, and so on. It will be evident from these examples that to express the position of an individual plane the numbers expressing its relations to the three axes must all be regarded, each with its appropriate sign ; in other words, the values of in, n, r, in the general form, me : nb : ra, must all be given, one of them being unity; m always refers to the vertical axis, c; n to the lateral axis, b ; r to the lateral axis, a ; as has already been remarked, a, is usually made the unit axis. In the example last given the axes, being all equal, are all called a."], [71, "MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 53 Reference must be made here to the method of lettering the axes adopted in this work.

DETEBMINATION OP PLANES BY ZONES. The subject of zones has been briefly explained on page 4, and various examples have been pointed out. The principle is one of the highest im portance, both practically, since it gives the means of determining the symbols of many planes without calculation, and also theoretically. The law of zones, which states simply that the planes of a crystal lie in zones, is one of the most important of the science, and second only7 to that of the rationality of the indices. The planes of a crystal thus may be said to be connected together by these zones, a single j.lane often lying in a large number of zones. Parallelism in the combination edges, or mutual intersections of planes, is based upon some common geometrical ratio, and this common ratio be longs to the symbols of all the planes of the zone. All planes which lie in the same zone will give exactly parallel reflections with the reflective goniometer, as explained on p. 87. This is the only decisive test, and when possible should be made use of, since combination-edges often appear parallel when the planes forming them are not really in the same zone. Furthermore, inasmuch as parallel intersections are observed between planes of a zone only when they actually intersect, the goniometer may often serve to detect the ex istence of zones not otherwise manifest. Iii f. 194, p. 45, the planes i-i, i-2, I, i-i, i-i, all lie in a vertical zone, and they are all obviously alike in this, that they are parallel to the vertical axis ; in other words, the common value c = co be- longs to them all. Again, in the zone O, l-l, 2-i, Acanthite. i-l, etc. (f. 197, p. 43), the planes are alike in that they are all parallel to the brachydiagonal axis ; in other words, a \u2014 co is true of all of them. Still again, the pyramidal planes \u00a3, 1, 2 (f . 150, p. 33), are also in a zone between 0 and 7, and here the ratio 1 : 1 for the lateral axes applies to all ; also, 1-2, 2-2, 4-2, are in a zone from 0 to i-2, and for them the lateral axes have the ratio 1:2. In the case of an oblique zone, as i-i, 3-i, 2-2, 1, etc. (f. 233), this fact is less evident on inspection, but is equally true, as will be seen later. The common ratio in this case is m = r. Since all the planes of a zone have a common ratio, which has been"], [72, "54 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. shown to be true in several examples but also admits of rigid proof, it is evident that a plane which lies in two zones has its position deter mined by that fact, since it must answer to two known conditions. In other words, the algebraic equation of a zone is known when the parame ters of two of its planes are given, for they are sufficient to determine the common ratio, and by combining them the zone equation is obtained ; and further, when the equations of two zones are given, combining them will give the equation, that is, the parameters, of the plane common to both. The general equation, derived from Analytical Geometry, for any plane me : nb : ra, making parallel intersections with the planes m'c : n'b : r'a and m\"c : n\"b : r\"a is, M X R , . . . , \u2014 + \u2014 + \u2014 = 0 ; m which, m n r 31= m'm\"(n'r\"-n\"r'); X= n'n\" (r' m\" -r\" m'); R = r'r\" (m'n\"-m\"nl). By substituting the values of the parameters of two given planes form', n' , r' , and m\" , ..\", r\" in the zone equation, a derived equation is obtained which expresses the relations between m, n, r of all the planes of the zone. The form of the general zone equation is so symmetrical that the calcula tions are in any case quickly and easily made by a method analogous to that used in Miller's system (as suggested by Prof. J. P. Cooke). H we write the parameters in parallel lines, repeating the first two terms, we have m' , n' \\y r' \\y m' \\/ n' m\" , n\" /\\ r\" X\\ m\" y\\ n\" and it will be seen that the coefficients II, X, R are found by multiplying together the parameters in the manner which the scheme indicates. 31= m'm\" (n' >\" ' \u2014 r'n\"). X= n'n\" (r'm\"\u2014m'r\"). R = r'r\" (m'n\"\u2014n'm\"). Take, for example, the zone of planes between i-l and 1 (f. 233). For i-i, m' = i, n' = 1, *.*' = i ; for 1, ...\" = 1, n\" = 1, r\" = 1 (i = co ) ; hence the scheme becomes i ; i x i x _ x J 1 , 1 /\\ 1 and for the several values of the coefficients 3I=i(l-i)= -#. X=l(i-i)=0. R = i(i -!) = <?. This reduces the zone equation torn = r (after dividing by i? = oo 2), and to this all the planes of the zone conform. So also for the zone of 1-i, I, 3-f, 1-i, etc., in f. 234. The parameters of the plane 7 and 1-i- arranged as above give i 1 1 i 1 1 i 1 1 i and the values of 31, X, R are \u2014 \u2014i , and +^^ respectively. Hence the zone equation becomes Ill + \u2014 =0; m n r '"], [73, "MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 55 m and if .*= 1 the sreneral formula?. = r is derived. Between : 1 : 1 (I) and 1 : . : 1 (1-i) the values of .. are positive, as with the series 'of planes i:l-i:l-i; 6c:f6:\u00ab; 5:\u00a3:l;4:i:l; 3:f:l; 2:2:1; f : 3 : 1, etc., 1 : . : 1. Between !:\u25a0_:! 234 and the values of n are negative, that is, are measured on the back half of the axis b ; as, for example, \\ : - 4 : 1 ; -f : - 3 : 1 ; \\ : - 2 : 1 ; \\ : \u20141:1. As the zone continues on from \\ : \u20141:1 to 1 : - 1 : \u00b1i (1-i), and i : \u2014 1 : \u2014 1 (7), the unit axis is changed, making u = \u2014 1. The zone equa- \u2014 m tion then becomes /\u25a0 = t, the values of r being: m \u2014 V \" positive between \\ : \u20141:1 and 1 : \u2014 1 : _t i, and negative between 1 : \u2014 1 : + i and i : \u20141 : \u2014 1. The successive planes are -f : \u20141 : 2 ; f : \u20141:3; 4: -1:4; 1 : -1 : \u00b1 i ; |:_l:-4; f : \u2014 1 : \u2014 3; 2 : -1 : -2, etc. Both figures 233 and 234 are illustrations of this zone. If the student will select a variety of examples of zones from the figures in the descriptive part of this work, and will apply the zone equation as given above to them, paying special attention to the signs of the parameters of each plane, he will soon find that the apparent difficulties of the subject disappear. EXHIBITION OF THE ZONE-RELATIONS OP DIFFERENT PLANES BY MEANS OP METHODS OP PROJECTION. The relations of the different planes of a crystal are to some extent exhi bited graphically in such figures as have been already given. Other meth ods, however, are used which have special advantages. The two most important are briefly mentioned here. 1. Quenstedfs method of projection. \u2014 In this method the planes of a crystal are projected upon a horizontal plane, usually that of the base (0). Every plane is regarded as pass- 235 ing through the unit-length of the axis which is taken as the vertical ; these planes consequently appear as straight lines intersecting each other on the plane of projection. The following are examples. In f. 235, of galenite, there are present the planes of the cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and tetragonal trisoctahedron f-f . In the projection (f. 236) the plane of the paper is taken as that of the cubic plane, the two equal lateral axes (a) are shown in the dotted lines, and the vertical axis is perpendicular to the plane of the paper at their point of intersection. Any arbitrary length of the lateral axes, as ca, is taken as the unit. One of the cubic planes coin cides with the plane of the paper, and the others, since they are supposed to pass through the unit point of the vertical axis, coincide with the projec tions of the lateral axes, and are marked 77, 77 The octahedral planes (1) appear as lines connecting the unit lengths of the equal lateral axes ; of the dodecahedral planes, four pass each through"], [74, "56 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. the extremity of one lateral axis, and parallel to the other, and four others are diagonal lines passing through the centre ; they are marked % in the figure. \" The other planes, f-f , when passing through the unit point ot the vertical axis, are represented by the symbols 1 : f : 1, and 1 : 1 : f, and 1 : \u00a7 : f, in the first quadrant, and similarly in the other three. The projection of the first of these planes is the line joining the points x (ex = f of ca1) and a' ; that of the second plane is the line joining the points a) and y (cy = -f of ca\") ; that of the third plane is the line joining the points 2l and 22 (czl = os' - f of ca). The same method is followed in the other quadrants, the twelve lines, lightly drawn, in the figure are the projections og7 of the twelve corresponding planes of the form 3-f. Fig. 237. 238, give another example (topaz) from the orthorhombic system. The dotted lines, as before (f. 238), show- the lateral axes on which the relative unit lengths of b and d belonging to this species have been marked off (b = 1.892, d = 1). The four lines passing through these unit points, a and b, are the pro- jections of the unit octahedron 1. The unit prism, 7, is projected in lines parallel to these, and passing through the centre. The prism i-i also passes through the centre, but the direction is that of a line joining the unit length of the axis b with two times that of a. The symbol of the octahedron |( = f c : b : a), becomes, on supposing the plane to pass through the unit point c : f b : fa, aud it is consequently projected in the lines of the vertical axis"], [75, "57 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. joining the points t (ct \u2014 f of cb), and * (cs = $ of ca). The symbol of the plane f-2 (= f e : b : 2a) becomes, on the same condition, c : \\b : -|a, and its projection lines consequently connect the points t (ct = f of cb) and n (cu = \u00a7 of ca). The same method is followed in the other systems ; in the hexagonal there are on the plane of projection three equal lateral axes cutting each other at angles of 60\u00b0. It will be seen from these examples that planes in a zone all pass through the same point of intersection; as in f. 234, O, f-f5 1, i(a2), and, f. 237, I, i-i, i-l (c) ; this is also true mathematically of the planes 0, 1, f , 7, whose projections are parallel. This principle, which follows immediatel v from the fact stated above that planes in a zone have a common ratio for two of the axes, is very important. If a given plane lie in two zones its projection must necessarily pass through the two points of intersections which belong to each of these respectively, and consequently its position is determined. The plane on f. 237 which has no written symbol for instance, lying in the zone with f and f, and the zone with 1 and -f-2, must, when projected, pass through the intersection point (f. 238) s of the former zone, and also through v that of the second zone. The plane itself, then, is one which meets the vertical axis at its unit length, the axis b obviously at an infinite distance, and the axis a at a distance f of its unit length ; hence, the sym bol is c : oo b : fa, or f c : v> b : a (ij-i) in the form it is usually written. In _ -._ __ \u201e . \u2014 . 3__, __ z_ . . s . many cases the ratios of the lateral every case, however, the position of of intersection on the axes, admits simple equations. axes are obvious at sight, as here ; in the zonal point, and of the two points of exact determination by a series of These equations it is unnecessary to add here ; reference for them may be made to Quenstedt's Crystallography, or that of Klein, mentioned on p. 59. This method is of so general use and of so easy application that every student should be familiar with it. Its advantages are that it leads to a clearer comprehension of the relations of the different forms, showing immediately all the zones in which they lie, aud in many cases \u2014 without the"], [76, "58 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. use of equations \u2014 suffices to determine the symbols of an unknown plane, and that more simply than by the use of the zonal equation. The general principles contained in the method have been made by its proposer (Quen stedt) the basis of an ingenious and philosophical system of Crystallography (Grundriss der bestimmenden und rechnendeu Krystallographie von Fr. Aug. Quenstedt, Tubingen, 1873). 2. Spherical projection of Xeumann and 3Iiller. \u2014 In this subject, as viewed by Miller, a crystal is situated within a sphere so that the centres of the two coincide. If now perpendiculars, or normals, be drawn from this centre to each plane, and be produced, they will meet the surface of the sphere, and these normal points will determine the position of each plane. If, then, this sphere is regarded as projected upon a horizontal plane it will appear as a circle, and the various normal points will occupy each its pro per position on or within this circle. This will be made more clear by an example. If the crystal (f. 237) be supposed to occupy the centre of a sphere, and if the terminal plane coincide with the plane of the paper, a normal to the plane O will meet the sphere of projection at the central point (f. 239) ; the planes i-l at the points indicated, and so of the other planes 1, f, i-i, etc. Two principles here are of fundamental importance : 1st, all planes of a zone have their nor mals in the same great circle, as i-l, f, |-i, etc. ; and 2d, the an gles between these normal points are the supplements of the an gles between the actual planes. These having been stated, it will be clear at once that the calcula tion of the angles between dif ferent planes, i.e., their normals, becomes merely a matter of solv ing a series of spherical triangles in which some parts are, given and others obtained by calcula tion. Upon this basis a system of crystallography was construct- ed by Miller in 1839, which, as further developed by Grailich, Schrauf, von Lang and Maskelyne, has every advantage over that of Naumaim in the matter of facility of calculation as in some other even more import ant respects. The method of construction of the circle of projection, for a given crystal, is in most cases very simple. The position of the crystal is commonly so taken that the prismatic zone is represented by the circumference of the circle, and the position of the normal-points of all prismatic planes lie upon it. The normal-points of the pinacoid planes are at \u00a70\u00b0 from one another (the macropinacoid is not present on the crystal, f. 237). The two corresponding diameters, at right angles to each other, which are properly the projections of two great cir cles, intersect at the centre the normal-point of the basal plane, 0 ; these diameters repre sent respectively the macrodome (m-i) and brachydome (m-i) zones of planes. The several positions of the normal-points of the prismatic planes are determined by laying off the sup plement angles of each with a protractor ; that of i-i is 43\u00b0 25', and of i\", 62\u00b0 8.', from the"], [77, "MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 59 normal-point of .- 1. The lines drawn between i-i, 0, and i-i (behind), and I, 0, /\"(behind) represent the zones of the m-i and m pyramids respectively. The position of the normal points of a dome or pyramid upon its respective zonal line (great circle) is formed by laying off from the centre a distance equal to the tangent of half the supplement angle of the given plane on 0, taking the radius as unity. For example, 0r\\ i-i = 126\u00b0 27', hence the position of the required normal-point will be about _ (.5046) of the radius measured from 0. It is in general necessary to determine in this way the normal-points of but very few of the planes, since those of the others are given by the zonal connection between the planes. Thus in this case, having determined in the way explained the positions of the points i-i, i-i, I, and |-., no further calculation is needed ; the point of intersection of the great circle joining i-i, f-i, and i-i, and that joining /, 0, I, is the normal-point of 3 ; also the point of intersection of the great circle i-i, f-., i-i with I, 0, I, is the normal -point of 1, and with i-i, 0, i-i that of f-2. The method explained is the same for all the orthometric systems ; for the clinometric sys tems the same principle is made use of, though the application is not quite so simple, since the basal plane does not fall at the centre of the circle. In the system of Miller the general form of the symbol is hkl, in which h, k, and I are always whole numbers, and, the reciprocals of Naumann's symbols. To translate the latter into the former it is only necessary to take the reciprocals and reduce the result to three whole numbers and write them in the proper order. In general, for m-n (me : nb : a), /.\u2022_;:. = mn : m : n, the latter expression being written in its simplest form, and, if neces sary, fractional forms must be reduced to whole numbers by multiplication. Conversely, from hkl is obtained in = -, n = , and hence, \u2014 \u2014 - = m-n. This applies to all the sys- l k Ik terns except the hexagonal, where a special process is required. See Appendix (p. 399). Methods of Calculation. In mathematical crystallography there are three problems requiring solution : 1st, The determination of the elements of the crystallization of a species, that is, the lengths and mutual inclination of the axes ; 2d, The determination of the mutual interfacial angles of like or unlike known planes ; and 3d, The determination of the symbols, that is, values of the parameters m and .. for unknown planes. This whole subject has been exhaustively discussed by Naumann in his several works on crystallography. (For titles, see p. iv. ) The long series of formulas deduced by him cover almost every case which can arise. In the present place the matter is treated briefly, since for all ordinary problems in crystallography the amount of mathematics required is very small. This is especially true in view of the fact that a large part of unknown planes can be determined by the zonal equation already given. When complicated problems do arise, the methods of spherical trigonometry (based on the spherical projection of Miller) offer, in the opinion of most crystallographers, the simplest and shortest mode of solution. It is be lieved that the student who has mastered the elements of the subject, after the method of Naumann here followed, will, if he desire to go further, find it to his advantage to turn to the system of Miller, referred to on p. 58 (See also Appendix. ) The formulas given under the different systems in the following pages are mostly those of Naumann, and it has been deemed desirable to explain at length, in most cases, the methods by which these formulas are deduced. If the student will follow these explanations through, he will find himself in a position to solve more difficult problems involving similar methods. Spherical triangles are employed in most cases, as early used by Hausmann (1813), by Naumann (1829), and others ; and carefully explained by Von Kobell in 1867 (Zur Berechnung der Krystallformen). The same methods have been elaborated by Klein (Einleitung in die Krystallberechnung, Stuttgart, 1875). THE BATIO OP THE TANGENTS IN RECTANGULAR ZONES. Tangent principle. \u2014 In any rectangular zone of planes, that is, a zone lyino- between two planes at right angles to each other, one of them being a\" diametral plane, the tangents of the supplement angles made with this"], [78, "60 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. diametral plane are proportional to the lengths of the axis corresponding to it. Examples of rectangular zones are afforded by the zones between i-i and i-i, also I and 0, f. 130, and 7\" and 0, in f. 208; still again between 7 and O, in f. 167; 7 and 0, also i-2 and O, in f. 150. In f. 217, the zone be tween i-i and i-i, and 0 and i-i, as also the zones between i-i and any one of the orthodomes, are rectangular zones, but not the zones between the basal and vertical planes (except i-i), nor those between i-i and a clinodome. The truth of the above law is evident from the accompanying figures. If the angles between the planes e1, <?, e3 (f. 240) and the basal plane O are given, their supplements are the 240 angles with the basal diametral section a1, a2, a3, respec tively7 (f. 241). The tangents of these angles are the respective lengths of the vertical axis, corresponding to each plane, as seen in the successive triangles. In each case we have b tan a = c, and hence, tan a1 : tan a2 : tan a3 ***\u25a0= c1 : c2 : c3. By the law stated on p. 10, the ratio of the axes must have some simple numerical value. In other words, if & be taken as the unit, c2 and <? must bear some simple ratio to it (denoted generally by m). In general, if as, a2, a3 are the supplement angles of three planes of a vertical zone upon a basal plane, then, tan a1 : tan a2 : tan a3 = mxc : m?c : m?c = iris : m2 : rn3. This is true as well for the pyramidal planes p1, p2, p3, and the domes d1, d2, d? (f. 240). This principle is most commonly applied to a vertical zone, where the angles on the basal plane are known, and the value of m for each is required ; it applies, however, in the same way, to any rectangular zone. For a prismatic are given = -y1, -y2, zone, if the supplement angles on i-i etc., then, tan 71 : tan t3 : tan 7s = b1 : b2 : bs = n1 : n2 : n3. These relations may perhaps be made more clear by a little further explanation. Suppose a plane to pass through the vertical axis at right angles to the given zone O, el, e\", e3, and intersecting it in the dotted line (see also f. 241). A similar section may be made with the planes d\\ d\\ dJ\\ or with p\\ p2, p'. From the section (f. 241), the relation of the vertical axes to the tangents of the basal angles is at once obvious. It will be seen here that a1, a3, etc., are not only the supplements of the interfacial angles measured on O, but are also equal to the angles measured on i-i diminished by 90\u00b0, and this is true in general. It will be also seen that the angles a1, a\", etc., may be obtained from the angles of the planes measured on each other. Thus, given .' A O = 180\"\u2014a1, and given _' Ae!, obviously a\" (sup plement of ,2A 0) = a1 + (180\u00b0 - \u00ab'a\u00ab!). USE OF SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY. The use of a spherical triangle often simplifies very much the operation"], [79, "61 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. of calculating the various angles and axial ratios. The following example will exemplify the principle involved. Fig. 242 represents a square octa- hedron of zircon. If we take the front solid angle of the octahedron as a cen tre, and from it imagine three arcs to be described with any radius \u2014 one .on the octahedral plane BA, another on the basal section CA, and a third on the diametral section CB, it is evi dent that a spherical triangle will be formed. In other words, the point a is imagined to be the centre of a sphere and the triangle ABC is that portion of its surface included between the three planes in question, In this triangle (f. 243) the successive parts are as follows : C = the angle between the basal and vertical diametral sections ; here 90\u00b0. a = the inclination of the vertical edge on the lateral axis. __?= the semi-vertical angle of the octahedron (= h (the hypothenuse) -- the plane angle of the octahedral face. A = the semi-basal angle (= \\Z). b = the inclination of tlie basal edg*e on the lateral axis. In the case given, b = 45\u00b0, since in this, the tetragonal system, the lateral axes are equal and the basal edge makes an angle of 45\u00b0 with each. Now if either A or 7? (that is, __T or Z) is given by measurement, two parts in the triangle will be known and the others can be rea lily calculated as they may be required. Other examples will be found in the pages which follow. In the majority of cases the spherical triangles obtained in the manner described are right-angled, and the problems resolve themselves into the solution of right-angled spherical triangles. In performing these operations practically, the student may be assisted by the following graphic method (used by Prof. Cooke, of Harvard University). It is based upon Napier's rules, which are familiar to every student : In a right-angled spherical triangle the sine of any part is equal to the product of the cosines of the opposite parts, or the product of the tangents of the adjacent parts. Here it is to be remembered that for the two angles and hypothenuse the complements are to be taken. The problems are represented graphically as follows : In the case given, suppose that the basal angle (Z) on the given octahedron has been measured and found to be 84\u00b0 19 46\", that is, the angle A = iZ= 42\u00b0 9' 53\", and hence 90\u00b0 \u2014 A = 47\u00b0 50' 7\". Then the parts of the triangle may be written, commencing with C, 90' (C) a b (45**) (90\u00b0 - B) (90\u00b0 - A) (90\u00b0 - h). If B is required, we have (for zircon) sin (90\u00b0 \u2014 B) = cos 45\u00b0 x cos 47\u00b0 50' 7\" ; whence _5= 61\u00b0 39' 47\", and the vertical angle (X) is 123\u00b0 19' 34\". Also, sin 45\u00b0 = tan a x tan 47\u00b0 50' 7\", tan a = 0.640373 = c, the vertical axis."], [80, "62 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.

The most commonly occurring prob lems are the determination of the symbols in the various forms, i-n, m, m-m, m-n (f. 51, 54, 65, 69). These cases will be considered in succession. In all but the last, but a single measurement is necessary. 1.

For a series of tetrahexahedrons the tangent law may be applied, since they form a zone between two cubic planes ; the dodecahedron falls in this zone, being a special case of the tetrahexahedron where n = 1. The angle between a plane i-n and the adjoining cubic face (H) is equal to v + 90\u00b0, hence, cot H '= n. 2. Form m, trigonal trisoctahedron. \u2014 The edges are of two kinds, A and P. (a) If the angle over B is given, suppose a diagonal plane to pass through the vertical axis and the edge A, meeting the planes, as indicated in the figure. A right-angled plane triangle is formed, of which the basal angle is equal to \\B, and the base is the diagonal line x. Then x tan \\B = the vertical side of the triangle (TO\u00ab),but x = V^ when a = 1, whence tan \\Bi/\\ = ma or m. (b) If the given angle is that of the edge A, place a spherical triangle (ma), as indicated in the figure. In this triangle C = 90\u00b0 (for the diagonal plane is perpendicular to the plane m), and the other angles are respectively \\A (half the mea- sured angle) and 60\u00b0 ; hence, the side opposite \u25a0\u00a3_4 (= the angle p) is obtained. Further, the angle of the two dotted diagonals (the octahe dral and dodecahedral axes) is 35\u00b0 16' (p. 16), whence, \\B = 144\u00b0 44' \u2014 p, and, as before, tan \\BV \\ = m. See further the following case. The general equations are thus : tan \\B V\\ = to. cos p = 2 cos \\AV\\ ; \\B = 144\u00b0 44' -p. (a) 3. Form to-to, tetragonal trisoctahedron. \u2014 Suppose (a) that the angle of the edge B is given. In the spherical triangle 1, in f. 246, C = 90\u00b0, and"], [82, "64 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. each of the other angles equals \\B. Hence, one of the equal sides (= angle v) is obtained, and tan v = to. (b) If the angle C is given, the triangle 2, in f. 246, is employed; here one angle is = 90\u00b0, a second = 60\u00b0, and the third =\\C, half the measured angle of the edge C. The side of the triangle = the angle p is calculated, and, as in the preced ing case, \u00a3\"= 141\u00b0 44'\u2014 p, then \u00ab.+ 1 = tan %V2. The planes to-to, 1, to, form a zone between the cubic and dodeca hedral planes as f. 461, p. 244, to which the tangent law may be often conveniently applied. The form m passes into the octahedron 1 when to = 1, and when to. is less than unity it becomes to-to, as explained on p. 17. Since these planes form a rectangular zone the tangent of the supple ment angles between them and a cubic plane are proportional to the values of m for the given forms ; only by applying this principle for m-m, the index \u2014 (= \u2014 : 1 : 1) will be obtained, which is equivalent to m-m m to u (= 1 : to : to). The general equations for the form m-m are : (a) cos v = cot 47? ; tan v = to. (b) cos p = cot hC Vi ; \u00a3 = 141\u00b0 W-p; tan $V2 = m + 1. 247 4. Form m-n, hexoctahedron. \u2014 The edges of the hexoctahedron are of three kinds, A, B, G (f. 247), and two measurements are, in general, needed in order to deduce the values of m and n. (a) Given A and B. In the oblique-angled spherical triangle I (f. 247), the three angles are iA, and 45\u00b0. In this triangle, the side opposite iA (.-= angle v) is calculated, and from it are obtained the values of to .and n, as follows : C0S-MV2 + cos IB . _, . cos v = \u2014 -: \u2014 j-p ; tan \\B sm v = m ; tan v = n. Sill ~^-L> (b) Given A and C. In the oblique-angled triangle II (f. 247), the three angles are ecpial respectively to -|j., %C, and 60\u00b0 The side opposite $__l (= angle p) is calculated. But the angle between the diagonals, that is, the octahedral and dodecahedral axes, is 35\u00b0 16', and the third angle of the triangle is \u00a3, the inclination of the edge C ou the dodecahedral axis ;"], [83, "65 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. hence, \u00a3 = _44\u00b0 44'\u2014 p. Again, in the right-angled triangle III (f. 247), one angle = 46', and the adjacent side = p, whence the other side, 8 (the in clination of the edge B on the dodecahedral axis), is obtained ; v =135\u00b0\u2014 8, and from this, as above, and from the angle p, are deduced the values of to and n. The formulas are : cos p = 8 co, *___ + \u00ab\u00ab j6' K = U40 M,_ tan g = gin ? tan K, sin \\C V 3 v = 135\u00b0\u2014 8 ; tan v = n : tan t= to. ' n + 1 (c) Given 7? and C. In the right-angled triangle, III (f. 247), the two angles are given, equal respectively to %B and $0. From the triangle is deduced the side opposite 46' (= angle 8 defined before), and from it is obtained v, and from v and $B, the values of to and n, as in the first case. The formulas are : cos 8 = - \u2014 \u2014 - - ; v = 135\u00b0\u2014 8 ; tan v = . . ; tan 47? sin v = to. sm If, instead of m-n, the form is to \u2014 - onlv one measurement is needed, to \u20141 and the process is simplified. When the angles of any plane m-n on two cubic planes are given, their supplements will be the angles of the plane upon the corresponding diametral sections, and from them the values of m-n may be readily7 calcu lated. Thus (in f . 24S), the angles of a given plane on a cubic plane at as will be the supplement of its angle upon the section a'a', that is, the angle B in the spherical 2*_8 triangle; similarly, the angle of a cubic plane at \u00abs will be the supplement of its angle on the section ala~ , the angle A in the spherical triangle. In this same triangle C = 90\u00b0. Hence, the sides opposite A and B, that is, the inclinations of the two edges on the adjacent axis, may be calculated, and this axis being equal to unity, their tangents will give the corresponding lengths of the other axes. These lengths may not be the values of to and n in the form in which the symbol is generally written, where the unit axis is always the shortest, but the latter are immediately deducible. For ex ample, if the angles here mentioned for the plane numbered 4 (in f. 247) had been measured, the values of the axes obtained by calculation, when the front axis is the unit, would be -J* and -J* respectively, and the symbol, hence, -J* : \\ : 1, which is equivalent to 1 : f : 3, or m-n = 3-f for the general form. Hemihedral forms. \u2014 For each hemihedral form the formulas are iden tical with those already given for the corresponding holohedral, so far as the edges of the two are the same. For example, in comparing f. 69 and f. 87 it is seen that the edges A and C are the same in both, while B of the holohedral form differs from B' of the hemihedral. The formulas re- 5"], [84, "66 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. quired to cover these additional cases are given below, they are obtained in a manner similar to those in the preceding pages. Form \\(in), f. 85.

It is only necessary to remark that the solution can generally be readily obtained by the use of one or two spheri cal triangles in the way shown in the preceding cases. The calculation of the interfacial angles between two known forms can often be performed by the formulas already given, or by similar methods. For the more general cases, reference must be made to the cosine formula, p. 62. Interfacial Angles. \u2014 I. Holohedral Forms. The following are some of the angles among the more common of Isometric holohedral forms; adjacent planes are to be understood, unless it is stated otherwise. The angles A, B, C, above, are those over the edges so lettered in the figures referred to (see pp. 15-19), or over the corresponding edges in related forms : H a H= 90\u00b0, f . 38 1 A 2-2 = 160\u00b0 32*, f. 58 i-f a H; A,= 133\u00b0 49' H A 1 = 125 16', f. 40, 41 1 A 3-3 = 150 30, f. 57 i-\u00a7 A \u00bb4, 6r,= 157 23 H A i = 135, f. 43, 45. 1 A I = 169 49 i-2 a i-2, -4,= 143 8, f. 65 Ma t-f = 146 19 1 A 2 = 164 12. f. 53 i-2 a i-2, C,= 143 8 II A .-2 = 153 26, f. 64 1 A 3 = 158 i-2 A i-2, ov. top, = 126 52 H A *'-3 = 161 34 1 A 3-1 = 157 45 i-2 a i-3 = 171 52 _7\"A M = 133 19 1 A 4-2 = 151 52 i-2 a 2-2 = 155 54 H A If = 136 45 1 A 54 = 151 25 i-3 a i-3, A,= 154 9, f. 66 U A 2-2 = 144 44, f. 55 i A i = 120 f. 45 i-3 A i-3, C,= 126 52 U A 3-3 = 154 46 i A \"', ov. top,= 90 2 A 2, A,= 152 44, f. 51 HAh ov. 1,= 115 14 i A i-f = 167 42 2 A 2, B,= 141 3\u00a3 ___*A2, \" =109 28, f. 52 i A i-2 = 161 34, f. 68 3 A 3, _4,= 142 8 Ha 3, \" =103 16 i A i-3 = 153 26 3 A 3, #,= 153 28J __TA 3-| = 143 18, f. 70 i A 2-2 = 150 3-f, A,- 158 13, f, 69 __/ a 4-2 = 150 48 i A 3-| = 160 54 3-1, B,= 149 ___*A 54= 147 41 i A 3-3 = 148 31 3-f, G,= 158 13 I a 1 = 109 28, t. 42 i a 44 =166 6 4-2, A,= 162 15 1 A 1. top,= 70 32 i A 54 = 162 58.- 4-2, _9,= 154 47i 1 a i = 144 44, f. 47 2-2 A 2-2, B,= 131 49, f. 54 4-2, C,= 144 3 lAi4 = 143 11 -2-2 A 2-2, G,= 146 27 54, A,= 152 20 1 A i-2 = 140 16, f. 67 2-2 A 2-2, ov. top. = 109 28 54, B,= 160 32 1 A i-3 = 136 54 3-3 A 3-3, B.= 144 54, f. 61 5-f, C,= 152 20 1 A 14 = 168 41 3-3 A 3-3, G,= 129 31 II.

II. \u2014 Tetragonal System. In the Tetragonal system, as has been fully explained (p. 30), the length of the vertical axis is variable, and must be determined for each species. If the length of c is known, then it may be required to determine the symbols of certain planes by means of measured angles. These two problems are in a measure complementary to each other, and the same methods will give a solution to either case. \"(For figures of the forms see pages 27 and 28.) The calculation of the interfacial angles can be performed by similar methods or by the cosine formula. 1. Form to. \u2014 The edges are of two kinds, pyramidal X, and basal Z. If either angle is known, the angle a, which is the inclination of the edge X on the lateral axis, may be calculated by the spherical triangle, as in f. 242, 243. (Compare the explanation of this case, p. 62.) Obviously in the plane right-angled triangle formed by the two axes and the edge X, tan a = me (since a = 1). If c is known, then in is determined ; and, con versely, a value being assumed for to, in the special case, c is given by the calculation. The general formulas are : cot _-_]_\"= sin a, or tan \\Z V -J = tan a ; then tan a = me. 2. Form m-i. \u2014(a) Given the angle Z, me is found immediately ; the solution is obvious, for in the section indicated by the dotted line (f . 249), \\Z = a, and the tangent of this angle is equal to the vertical axis, (b) Given the angle Y. A spherical triangle placed as in f. 249, has one angle = hY, a second = 45\u00b0, and the third = 90\u00b0, whence the side opposite \\ Y is calculated, which is the complement of a. The general formulas, which may serve to de duce the value of m, when c is given, or the con- 249 verse, are : cos \\Y Y2 = sin a, or tan \\Z = tan a, and tan a = me If a series of square octahedrons to, or m-i, occur in a vertical zone, their symbols may be calculated in both cases alike by the law of the tangents, the angles of the planes on 0, or on I, or i-i, respectively, being given. (See p. 60.) 3. Form i-n. \u2014 For the angle of the edge X (f . 109, p. 26), at the extrem ity of a lateral axis, tan \\X = n. From the angle of the other edge Y, we have \\X = 135\u00b0\u2014 \\Y; and hence, tan (135\u00b0\u2014 \\Y) = ... 4. Form m-n. \u2014 The edges are of three kinds, X, Y, Z(i. 250), and two angles must be given in the general case to determine m and n. (a) Given _3Tand Z. A spherical triangle having its vertices on the edges Xand Z, and the lateral axis, as 1, f. 250, will have two of its angles equal -O-JTT, \\Z, respectively, and the third equal to 90\u00b0. The solution of this triangle gives the sides, viz., a and v, the inclinations of the edges X and"], [87, "MATHEMATICAL crystallography, 69 Z, respectively, on the lateral axis. The tangents of these angles give the values of to and ... The formulas are as follows : cos 4Z cos YaZ \u2014 : \u2014 \u00b1\u2014 _ = cos a, tan a = me ; =^- = cos v, tan v = n. sm \u00a3X sm YZ (b) Given Y and Z. In a second triangle placed as indicated (2, f . 250), two of the angles are and \\Z respectively, and the third is 90\u00b0. The solution of this second 250 triangle gives 8, the inclination of the edge Z on the diagonal axis, from which, in the plane triangle we have v = 135\u00b0 \u2014 8, and from v is ob tained n. Still again from the triangle 1 (f. 250), and its solution used in the preceding case, having given Z and v, a is obtained, and from it m ; as by the following formulas : cos J\" = cos 8, v = 135\u00b0-S, tan i\u00bb = n ; sin 4__T tan sin i> = tan a = toc. (c) Given _3Tand Y. A third triangle, numbered 3 in the figure, has two of the angles equal toA-JTand -J* _F\" respectively, and the third is 45\u00b0. Solv ing this oblique-angled triangle, the angle of the inclination of the edge Y on the vertical axis is obtained, and its complement is the angle e, the in clination of the edge Y on the diagonal axis; from e and -J Y are obtained, by triangle 2, 8, and thence, as above, n; and finally, from X and v, is obtained a, and from that the value of to. The simplified formulas are as follows : COS4F./2 \u201e . , _ n? \u2014 = n\u20141 ; sm a = n cot 4 A, tan a = toc. cos -JA Pyramids of the general symbol 1-n, m-m, etc., are especial cases of the preceding, the processes being for them, however, somewhat simplified. A single measurement is sufficient. III. Hexagonal System. In the Hexagonal system there are three equal lateral axes (a) inter secting at angles of 60\u00b0, and a fourth vertical axis (c) at right angles to the plane of the others. Taking a = 1, there remains but one unknown quantity in the elements of a crystal, that is the length of c, and a single measurement is sufficient to determine this. The relations of the three lateral axes have been explained on p. 32. The hexagonal system is closely allied to the tetragonal, and optically they are identical, as is shown beyond. Schrauf refers all hexagonal forms to two lateral axes crossing at right"], [88, "70 crystallography. angles and a vertical axis, in order to show this relation. According to him, in this system, the axes are c : aV'3 : a ; in the tetragonal they are c : a : a. Miller's school, on the contrary, employ three equal axes, making equal angles with each other, and each normal to a face of the fundamental rhom bohedron. In each of these methods a holohedral form, for instance a hexagonal pyramid, is considered as made up of two sets of forms, having different indices. A. \u2014 Holohedral Forms. 1. Form to: hexagonal pyramid, first series. \u2014 Suppose a spherical trian gle, inscribed in f . 148, p. 33, having its vertices upon the edges X and Z, and the corresponding lateral axis respectively, similar to the triangle of f. 242. This will be a right-angled triangle. (a) When the angle of the edge A\" is given, then \u00a3, the inclination of the edge X upon the adjoining lateral axis, is calculated : sin f = cot \u00a7X V3, and tan \u00a3 = me, or = c, the vertical axis, when to = 1 (b) Given the angle Z. tan \u00a7 Z V% = me, or = c when m = 1 2. Form m-2 : hexagonal pyramid, second series. \u2014 These pyramids bear the same relation to those of the to series as the m-i octahedrons to to octa hedrons of the tetragonal system. (Compares. 112,146.) The methods of calculation are similar (f. 249.) The edges are of two kinds, vertical I' and basal Z. (a) Given the angle Y. 2 cos 4 Y = sin \\Z, and tan _-__. = me, or c when to = 1 (b) Given the angle Z. Then simply tan \\Z = toc. 3. Form i-n : dihexagonal prism. \u2014 The vertical edges are of two kinds, axial A', and diagonal Y; the solution in either case is by means of a plane triangle, in a cross-section analogous to that of f. 146. (a) Given X. i\u2014 n tan \\X\\% = 2Z^' (b) Given Y. W+l tan -J1V3 = 7"], [89, "71 mathematical crystallography. 4. Form m-n : dihexagonal pyramid. \u2014 The edges (f. 251) are of three kinds, X and Y terminal, and __. basal; measurements of two of these are required to give the values of m and 251 n ; this is analogous to the calculation for the form m-n in the preceding system. (a) Given X and Z. In a spherical triangle having its vertices on the edges X and Z, and the adjoining \"lat eral axis respectively, two angles are given. If v = the inclination of the edge __. upon the lateral axis (the side of the spherical triangle opposite the angle ), then cos \\X \u201e ,_ cos \" = o',_ i/i n \u2014 \u2022\u00a7\u25a0 = tan (k - 30\u00b0) V f ; tan \u00a3_? sin z/ = toc. Sill 2 (b) Given Y and Z. The right-angled spherical triangle has its vertices on the edges _Fand Z and the diagonal axis. If 8 = the inclination of the edge z upon this diagonal lateral axis, then : R cos 47\" __ cos 8 = . x7 ; but n - \\ = tan (120\u00b0- 8) V\\, Sill 2^ also (150\u00b0\u2014 8) = v ; and, as before, tan \\Z sin v = toc. (c) Given A\" and Y. In the oblique-angled spherical triangle, with its vertices upon the edges X and Y and the vertical axis, the three angles are known, viz., %X, \\Y, and 30\u00b0, hence : 2-n _ cos $XV3. \u25a0n \u2014 1 cos 4 Y Further, if |f = the angle of inclination of the edge A\" upon a lateral axis, that is, the complement of the same edge upon the vertical axis (the side of the spherical triangle opposite the angle \\ Y ), t/g sin |f = n cot 4AT, and tan \u00a3 = toc. 2 \u2014 n If the pyramid m-n takes the form to- , as determined by its zonal m\u20141 relations, the calculations are simplified, since one unknown quantity7 only, to, has to be determined, and one measurement is sufficient. B. \u2014 Rhombohedral Division. The relation of the rhombohedrons and scalenohedrons to the true hexa gonal forms has been made clear in another place. The rhombohedron is the hemihedral form of the hexagonal pyramid to, and its symbol is writ-"], [90, "72 crystallography. ten \u2122 , or usually mR. The scalenohedron is the corresponding hemihe dral form of the twelve-sided pyramid, and its symbol is written \\{in-n) or m'R1'. The latter symbol, proposed by Eaumann, has reference to the rhombohedron whose lateral edge corresponds to the edge X of the given scalenohedron. The formulas given by Naumann for reducing the symbol i(tn-n) to the form m'R'1' are as follows : a n 2 \u2014 n For tCie converse, to reduce m'R71' to the form \\(m-n), 2n' m = mn' and n = , -. 1. Rhombohedrons, mR. \u2014 The methods of calculation are simple, and will be understood from f . 252. The edges are of 252 two kinds, X and Z, and their relation is such that the corresponding angles are the supplements of each other. Given the angle of the edge X. A spherical triangle is placed, as indicated by AT? 6', in f. 252, with \"its vertices respectively on the edge A', the vertical axis, and the diagonal of the rhombohe dral face.

Attention must also be called to the zonal relations of certain -j- and \u2014 rhombohedrons, remarked on p. 36 ; these relations may7 be conveniently shown by means of Quenstedt's method of projection. 2.

Of the three rectangular axes in the Orthorhombic system, one is always taken equal to unity, in this work the shortest (d). This leaves two unknown quantities to be determined for each species, namely, the lengths"], [92, "74 crystallography. of the axes c and b, expressed in terms of the unit axis a, and for this end two independent measurements are required. The simpler cases are considered here. Calculation of the Lengths of the Axes. Let a = the inclination of the edge Z to the axis d (f . 253). 8 = the inclination of the edge X to the axis a. <y = the inclination of the edge Y to the axis b. From the plane triangle formed by each edge and the axes adjacent (f. 253, 254) the following relations are deduced, when d = 1 : (1) Given a and B, tan /3 = c and _tan a = b. (2) Given a and 7, tan a = b, and b tan 7 = c. (3) Given /3 and 7, tan /3 = c, and c cot 7 = b. The angles a, /3, 7 are often given direct by measurement ; for, obviously (f. 254, 255), a = the semi-prismatic angle 7\" A 7 (over i-i). /3 = the semi-basal angle of 1-i- A 1-i. 7 = the semi-basal angle of 1-i A 1-.. Also 7 A i-i = a + 90\u00b0 ; 1-i A i-i = /3 + 90\u00b0 ; li A 0 = 180\u00b0 -/3, etc. From the octahedron (f. 253), the angles a, /3, 7 are calculated immedi ately by the following formulas, and from them the length of the axes as above. (a) Given X and Z (spherical triangle I, f. 253), cos 4X a cos 4Z cos a = \u2014 \u2014 \u00b1=. \u2022 cos B = V sm -J-z sm \u00a7X (5) Given _Fand Z (spherical triangle II, f. 253), cos*|_F cos 4Z sin a = . , - ; cos 7 = . - . sm \\Z sm 4 Y (c) Given X and _T (spherical triangle III, f . 253), . 0 cos^Y . cos 4X sm a \u2014 =-=.; sm y = i-=, sin-JX' 7 sin i?"], [93, "75 mathematical crystallography. If any one of the angles a, 8, or 7 is given, as from the measurement of a prism or dome, and also any one of the angles of the octahedral edges X, 1 , or Z, a second of the former angles may be calculated, and from the two the axes are obtained as before. The formulas, derived from the same spherical triangles, are as follows : (1) Given X and a, sin 8 = cot \\X tan a. X and B-, tan a = tan \\X sin 8- Xand 7, cos /3 = cot JX cot 7. (2) Given Y and a, sin 7 = cot i Y cot a. _Fand/3, cos 7 = cot iY cot 8- I\" and 7, cot a = tan iY sin 7. (3) Given Z and a, tan 7 = tan i Z cos a. Z and B, cos a = cot i Z tan 7. Z and 7, sin a = cot i Z tan /3. Calculation of the values of to and n. The above formulas cover all the ordinary cases, the only change that is required in them is to write for c, b,a, in equations (1), (2), (3), above, c', b', a', the lengths of the axes for the given form, noting that c' = toc, and so on. 1. I'risms, i-h or i-h. As remarked, the semi-prismatic angle (over i-i) is the angle a (f. 254), and tan a = nb. If the calculated value of n is greater than unity, the form is written 00 c : nb : a (i-h) ; if less than unity, the form is written co c : b : na (i-n), b being the unit axis. Thus i-J (00 c : ib : a) becomes i-i (00 c : b : 2a). 2. Domes, m-i and m-i. \u2014 No further explanation is needed (f. 255) ; here tan 8 = mc- or b tan 7 = me. \u2022 3. Octahedrons, to. \u2014 Here the angle a is always known (it being the same as for the unit-octahedron where tan a = b), and hence a single meas ured angle, X, Y, or Z will give the values of either /3 or 7 for the given form, and tan /3 = me, b tan 7 = toc. 4. Forms m-h or m-h. \u2014 The measurement of the angles X, Y, Z will give the values of a, 8, and 7 belonging to the given form, and tan 8 = me, tan a = nb, etc. Here, as in the prisms, if n is less than unity, when the axis a is the unit, the symbol is transposed, and the axis b made the unit, thus 2c : ib : a (2-J) becomes 4c : b : 2a (4-2). If the alible between the form m-h (or m-h) and either of the pinacoids can be measured, the method of calculation is essentially the same (Com pare f. 248) ; for m-n A 0 (base) = supplement of the angle 4Z; m-n A i-i (macropinacoid) = supplement of the angle iY ; and m-n A i-i (brachypinacoid) = supplement of the angle iX. The method of calculation of planes in a rectangular zone by means of the tano-ents of their supplement basal angles finds a wide application in this system. It applies not only to the main zones 0 to i-i (macrodomes),"], [94, "76 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 0 to i-i (brachydomes), i-i to i-i (vertical prisms), and I 7 to 0 (unit octahe drons), but also to any zone of octahedrons m* (or f*n) between 0 and \u2022\u00bb (or *.-#), and any transverse zone from %-% to m-i, and *-* towi-i. V\". Monoclinic System. In the Monoclinic system the number of unknown quantities is three, viz., the lengths of the axes c and b, expressed in terms of the unit clinodiagonal axis a, and the oblique angle /_? (also called C), between the basal and vertical diametral sections, that is, between the axes c and a. Three independent measurements are needed to determine these crystallographic elements. The angle 8 is obtuse in the upper front quadrants, and acute in the lower front quadrants; the planes in the first mentioned quadrants are distinguished from those be low by the minus sign. The unit octahe dron is made up of two hemi-octahedrons (\u2014 1 and +1), as shown in f. 256. Calculation of the Lengths of the Am, and the Angles of obliquity. Eepresent (see f. 256) the inclination of the Edge X on the axis c by p.. X on a by v. Y on c by p. ' X' \" \" c \" ps. X on d by v. Z on a by o.

(3) In the basal section, a tan <r = b. The above formulas serve to determine the lengths of the axes, and the angle of obliquity, or, if these are known, to determine the values of to and n by substituting toc for c, etc. The angles p, v, p, <r, etc., must, in general, be determined by calculation from measured angles. Let the inclination of a plane in the positive quadrant on the clinodi agonal section be denoted by X; that on the orthodiagonal section by Y; that on the basal section by7 Z. Let also the corresponding inclinations of a plane in the negative quadrants be indicated by X ', Y, Z', respectively (see f. 256). It is to be noted, when the pinacoids are present, that + 1 A 0 = 180\u00b0- Z; + lA.-i = 180\u00b0-r; + 1 A.4 = 180\u00b0-X; - 1 A O = 180\u00b0- Z' ; -lAi-i = 180\u00b0- J\" ; - 1 A i-i = 1S0\u00b0-X. The same is true for the corresponding angles of the general form \u00b1 m-n, or m-n. Also, when \u00b1 1 (f. 256) alone are present (or m-n) note that + 1 A + 1 = 2X; -1A-1=2X; + 1 A - 1 (orthodiag.)= Y+ T ; (basal) = Z+Z'. Any three of these angles will serve to give for the unit form (\u00b1 1) the length and obliquity of the axes, or, when these are known, two of these angles are sufficient to deduce the values of to and n for any unknown form. In the first case, as one of the three measured angles must be either Y+ Y or Z + Z', the formulas given above do not immediately apply. For example, if X, X and Y + Y are given. Placing a spherical triangle, abc, in f. 256, with its vertices on the edges X, X, and Y, in this the three angles will equal X, X and Y+ Y respectively ; here the side, ac, opposite the angle (Y+ Y') is calculated, which gives the value of p + ps , also the side, be, opposite X' ; then, again, in the right-angled spherical triangle, where be and X are known, p is obtained, thus ps is known and also 8- The lengths of the axes follow from the formulas given above. The following are some of the eases which may occur: (a) Given 0, and i-i. O A i-i (front)= 180\u00b0- /3, behind = B. (b) Given O, - 1-i, and + 1-i.

Thus 8, /*\u00bb an<I \" are known, and from them the relation of the axes a and c is deduced.

In the spherical triangle ABD (f. 258), the angle A = 4(7a I), B = - 1/\\L,D = 4(\u2014 1 A \u20141) = X, from which the sides AD = v' + (180\u00b0 - 8) and AB are calculated. Then in the second triangle, AB C, C = 90\u00b0, AB is known, also A; 1 ence, CB = a and CA = 180\u00b0 - 8 are calculated. Thus v' and p' and /3 become known, and the relation of a to c ; also from a follows the ratio of d to b. Calculation of the values of to and n. In general, it may be said that the methods of calculation are the same as those already given. In each case the values of p, v, p, cr are to be obtained, and those introduced into the axial equations (1, 2, 3) given above give the values of toc, nb, etc., from which m and n are derived. When in the general form m-n (me : nb : a) n is found to be less than unity7, then b is made the unit axis and the form is written m-h (me : b : na), thus 2c : ib : a' becomes 4c : b : 2a (i-i), the same is true for i-n and i-h. 1.

The following hemi-octahedrons require one measurement only : \u00b1 to, \u00b1 to-to, \u00b1 to-to, \u00b1 l-\u00bb, \u00b1 1-A. Further, it is to be noted in regard to them that the forms \u00b1 to have the same ratio of the lateral axes as \u00b1_ 1, that is, the same value of a. Forms \u00b1 1-n, and +_ m-m, have the same ratio of the axes c and d as the unit form \u00b1 1, that is, the same values of p,, v (p,', v').

Triclinic System. The triclinic system is characterized by its entire want of symmetry. The inclinations of all the diametral planes, and hence, the inclination of the axes, are oblique to one another. There are, then, five unknown quan tities to be determined in each case, viz., the three angles of obliquity of the axes, and the lengths of the axes b and c, a being made = 1. The axes are lettered as in the orthorhombic system : c = the vertical axis, b = the maerodiagonal axis, and a = the brachydiagonal axis. Let (f. 259) a = angle between the axes c and b: B = angle between the axes c_ and a ; 7 = angle between the axes b and a. Also, let A = angle of inclination of the diame tral planes meeting in the axes a ; B = angle of inclination for those intersecting in the axis b, and C \u2014 the angle of those meeting in c. The maerodiagonal (m-h) and brachydiagonal (m-n) planes are indicated as in the orthorhombic system, also the planes opposite the acute angle (B) are called +, and those opposite the corre sponding obtuse angle \u2014 ; furthermore, the planes 259 in front, to the right (and behind, to the left) are distinguished by an accent, as -m-n'. In the fundamental octahedron formed by four sets of planes, these are, taken in the usual order (f. 227), \u2014 1', \u2014 J, +1', + 1, and below, + 1', + 1,-1', -1. In the determination of any individual crystal belonging to this system, the axial directions as well as unit values have to be assumed arbitrarily ; in many cases (e.g., axinite) the custom of different authors has varied much. Two points are to be considered in making the choice : 1, the cor respondence in form with related species, even if these be not triclinic, as, for example, in the feldspar family ; and 2, the ease of calculation, which is much facilitated if, of the planes chosen as fundamental, the pinacoids are all, or at least in part, present. In general, the methods of calculation are not simple. Some of the most important relations are given here (from Naumann). In actual practice, problems which arise may be solved byT some of the following formulas, or by means of a series of appropriate spherical triangles, used as in the preceding pages, and bj which, from the measured angles, the required elements of the forms may be obtained. In addition to the angles already defined, let, as follows (f. 259), X= inclination of a plane on the brachydiagonal section ; Y= \" \" \" macrodiagonal \" Z= \" \" \" basal \" Let the inclination of the edge, X on c = p, Y on c = p, Z on cl = a, X on a = v, Y on b = tr, Z on b = r,"], [99, "81 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. When the three pinacoids are present, the angles A, B, C are given by measurement. These angles are connected with the axial angles by7 the following equations : cos A + cos B cos C n cos B + cos C cos A cos a = : \u2014 j-\u2014. \u2014 ; cos 8 = \u2014 77-^ 1 ; sm 7> sm 6 sm 6 sm A cos C + cos A cos B cos 7 = : j\u2014 - \u2014 jy ; sm A sin B also, sin a : sin /3 : sin 7 = sin A : sin B : sin C.

It is supposed in the above that the measured edge is parallel to the axis of the given hemiprism, etc. ; when this is not the case the relations are a little less simple."], [101, "83 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Measurement of the Angles of Crystals. The angles of crystals are measured by means of instruments which are called goniometers. The simplest form of these instruments is the hand-goniometer, repre sented in f. 260. It consists of an arc, graduated to half degrees, or finer, and two movable arms. In the instrument figured, one of the arms, ab, has the motion forward and backward by means of slits gh, ik ; the other arm, ed, has also a similar slit, and in addition it turns around the centre of the arc as an axis. The planes whose inclination is to be measured are applied between the arms ao, co, and the latter adjusted so that they and the surfaces of the planes are in close contact. This adjustment must be made with care, and when the instrument is held up to the light none must pass through between the arm and the plane. The number of degrees read off on the arc between k and the left edge of d (this edge being in the line of the centre, o , of the arc) is the angle required. The motion to and fro by means of the slits is for the sake of convenience in measuring small or imbedded crystals. In a much better form of the instrument the arms are wholly separated from the arc ; and the arc is a delicately graduated circle to which the arms are adjusted after the measurement. The hand-goniometer is useful in the case of large crystals, and those whose faces are not well polished ; the measurements with it, however, are seldom within a quarter of a degree of accuracy. In the finest specimens of crystals, where the planes are smooth and lustrous, results far more accurate may be obtained by means of a different instrument, called the reflecting goniometer. Reflecting Goniometer. \u2014 This instrument was devised by Wollaston, in 1809, but it has been much improved in its various parts since his time, especially by Mitscherlich. The principle on which it is constructed may be understood by reference to the following figure (f. 261), which repre sents a crystal, whose angle, abc. is required. The eye at P, looking at the face of the crystal, be, observes a reflected"], [102, "84 crystallography. image of m, in the direction of Pn. The crystal may now be so changed in its position, that the same image is seen reflected by 261 the next face and in the same direction, Pn. To effect this, the crystal must be turned around, until abd has the present direction of be The angle dbc, measures, therefore, the number of degrees through which the crystal must be turned. But dbc, subtracted from 180\u00b0, equals the required angle of the crystal, abc. The crystal is, therefore, passed in its revolution through an angle which is the supplement of the required angle. This angle evidently may be measured by attaching the crystal to a gradnated circle, which should turn with the crystal. The accompanying cut (f. 262) represents a reflecting goniometer made"], [103, "85 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. by Oertling, in Berlin. It will suffice to make clear the general character of the instrument, as well as to exhibit some of the refinements added for the sake of greater exactness. The circle, C, is graduated, in this case, to twenty minutes, and by means of the vernier at v the readings may be made to minutes and half min utes. The crystal is attached by means of wax to the little plate at k ; this may be removed for convenience, but in its final position it is, as here, at the extremity of the axis of the instrument. This axis is moved by means of the wheel, .. ; the graduated circle is moved by the wheel, to. These motions are so arranged that the motion of n is independent, its axis being within the other, while on the other hand the revolution of m moves both\" the circle and the axis to which the crystal is attached. This ar rangement is essential for convenience in the use of the instrument, as will be seen in the course of the following explanation. The screws, c, d, are for the adjustment of the crystal, and the slides, a, b, serve to centre it. The method of procedure is briefly as follows : The crystal is attached by means of suitable wax at k, and adjusted so that the direction of the combination-edge of the two planes to be measured coincides with the axis of the instrument ; the wheel, n, is turned until an object (e.g., a window bar) reflected in one plane is seen to coincide with another object not reflected (e.g., a chalk line on the floor), the position of the graduated circle is observed, aud then both crystal and circle revolved together by means of the wheel, to, till the same reflected object now seen in the second plane again coincides with the fixed object (that is, the chalk line) ; the angle through which the circle has been moved, as read off by7 means of the vernier, is the supplement angle between the two planes. In order to secure accuracy7, several conditions must be fulfilled, of which the following are the most important : 1. The position of the eye of the observer must remain perfectly stationary. 2. The object reflected and that with which it is brought in coincidence, should be at an equal distance from the instrument, and this distance should not be too small. 3. The crystal must be accurately7 adjusted ; this is so when the line seen reflected in the case of each plane and that seen directly with which it is in coincidence are horizontal and parallel. It can be true only when the intersection edge of the two planes measured is exactly in the direction of the axis of the instrument, and perpendicular to the plane of the circle. 4. The cry7stal must be centered as nearly as possible, or, in other words, the same intersection -edge must coincide with a line drawn through the re- . . . volving axis. This condition will be seen to be distinct from the preced ing, which required only that the two directions should be the same. The error arising when this condition is not satisfied diminishes as the object reflected is removed farther from the instrument, and becomes zero if the object is at an infinite distance. The first and second conditions are both satisfactorily fulfilled by the use of a telescope, as t, f. 262, with slight magnifying power. This is arranged for parallel light, and provided with spider lines in its focus. It admits also of some adjustments, as seen in the figure, but"], [104, "86 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. \u25a0when used it must be directed exactly toward the axis of the goniometer. This telescope has also a little magnifying glass (g, f. 262) attached to it, which allows of the crystal itself being seen when mounted at k. This latter is used for the first adjustments of both planes, and then slipped aside, when some distant object which has been selected must be seen in the field of the telescope as reflected, first by the one plane and then by the other as the wheel ;. is revolved. When the final adjustments have been made so that in each case the object coincides with the centre of the spider-cross of the telescope, and when further the edge to be measured has been centered, the crystal is ready for measurement. This telescope, obviously, can be used only when the plane is smooth and large enough to give distinct and brilliant reflections. In many cases sufficient accuracy is obtained without it by the use of a window-bar and a white chalk line on the floor below for the two objects ; the instrument in this case is placed at the opposite end of the room, with its axis parallel to the window ; the eye is brought very close to the crystal and held motionless during the measurement. The best instruments are provided with two telescopes. The second stands opposite the telescope, t (see figure), the centres of both telescopes being in the same plane perpendicular to the axis of the instrument. This second telescope has also a hair cross in the focus, and this, when illuminated by a brilliant gas burner (the rest of the instrument being protected from the light by a screen) will be reflected in the successive faces of the crystal. The reflected cross is brought in coincidence with the cross in the first telescope, first for one and then for the other plane. As the lines are delicate, and as exact coincidence can take place only after perfect adjustment, it is evident that a high degree of accuracy is possible. Still more than before, however, are well-polished crystals required, so that in the majority of cases the use of the ordinary double telescopes is impossible. Very often, however, the second telescope may be advantage ously replaced by7 another having an adjustable slit in its focus, as proposed by Websky, allowing of being made as narrow as is convenient; or, as sug gested by Schrauf, the spider-lines of the second telescope may be re placed by a piece of tin-foil, in which two fine cross lines have been cut; these are illuminated by a gas-burner. By these methods the reflected object is a bright line or cross, instead of the dark spider-lines, and it is visible in the first telescope even when the planes are extremely minute, or, on the other hand, somewhat rough and uneven ; the image is naturally not perfectly distinct, but sufficiently so to admit, of good measurements (e.g., within two or three minutes). The third and fourth conditions are the most difficult to fulfil absolutely. In the cheaper instruments the contrivance to accomplish the end often consists of a jointed arm so placed as to have two independent motions at right angles to each other. In the best instruments the greatest care and attention is paid to this point, and a great variety of ingenious contrivances have been devised to overcome the various practical difficulties arising. The cut (f. 262) shows one of these in its simpler form. The crystal is approximately adjusted by the hand, and then the operation completed by means of the screws c and d. These give two motions at right angles to"], [105, "87 MATHEMATICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. each other, and the arrangement is such that the motions are made on the surface of a spherical segment of which the crystal itself occupies the centre, so that it is not thrown entirely out of the axis of the instrument by the motions of the screws. The adjustment having been accurately made, the edge is centered by means of two sliding carriages, a, b, moving at right angles to each other ; here they are moved by hand, but in better instruments by fine screws. The edge must be first centered as carefully as practicable, then the complete adjustments made, and finally again centered, as before, to remove the excentricity caused by7 the movement of the ad justment screws. The successful use of the most elaborate instruments is only to be attained after much patient practice. Theoretical discussions of the various errors arising in measurements and the weight to be attached to them have been given by Kuppfer (Breis schrift iiber genaue Messiing der Winkel an Krystallen, 1825), also by Naumann, Grailich, Schrauf, and others (see literature, p. iv). It has been stated that when the two planes have been adjusted in the goniometer so that their combination-edge is parallel to the axis of the instrument, the reflections given by them will be parallel. It is evident from this that any other planes on the crystal which are in the same zone with the two mentioned planes will also give, as the circle is revolved, reflections parallel to these. This means gives the test referred to on p. 53, leading on the one hand to the discovery of zones not indicated by parallel intersections, and on the other hand showing, in regard to supposed zones, whether they are so in fact or not. The degree of accuracy and constancy in the angles of crystals as they are given by nature is an important subject. Crystallography as a science is based upon the assumption that the forms made by nature are perfectly accurate, aud whenever exact measurements are possible, supposing the cr3*stals to have been free from disturbing influences, it has been found that this assumption is warranted by the facts ; in other words, the more accurate the measure ments th. more closely do the angles obtained agree with those required by theory. An example may illustrate this : \u2014 On a crystal of sphalerite (zinc-blende), from the Binnenthal. exact measurements were made by Kokscbarow to test the point in question. He found for the angle of the tetrahedron 70J 31' 48\", required 70D 31' 44\" ; for the octahedral angle 109\u00b0 27 42\", required 109\u00b0 28 16'; and for the angle between the tetrahedron and cube 125\u00b0 15' 52', required 125\u00b0 15' 52\". The crystallographic works of the same author, as well as those of many other workers in the same field, contain many illustrations on the same subject. At the same time variations in angle do occasionally occur, from a change in chemical composition, and from various disturbing causes, such as heat and pressure (see further, p. 107). Further than this, it is universally true that exact measurements are in comparatively few cases possible. Many crystals are large and rough, and admit of only approximate results with the hand goniometer ; others have faces which are more or less polished, but which give uncertain reflections. This is due in some cases to striations, in others to the fact that the surfaces are curved or more or less covered with markings or etchings, like those common on the pyramidal planes of quartz. In all such cases there is a greater or less discrepancy between the measured and calculated angles. The important point to be noted always is the degree of accur.icy attainably or, in other words, the probable error. The true result to be accepted is always to be obtained by the discussion of all the measurements in accordance with the methods of least squares. This method involves considerable labor, and in most cases it is sufficient to take the arithmetical mean, noting what degree of weight is to be attached to each measurement. It is to be noted that where measurements vary largely the probable error in the mean accepted will be con siderable ; moreover an approximate measurement may not be the more accurate because it happens to agree closely with the theoretical angle. For the determination of the symbols of planes, measurement accurate within 30', or even 1\u00b0, are generally sufficient. When planes are rough and destitute of lustre the angles can best be obtained with the"], [106, "88 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. reflecting goniometer, the reflections of the light from an object like a candle-flame, being taken in place of more distinct images. For imbedded crystals, and often in other cases, measurements may be very advantage ously made from impressions in some material, like sealing-wax. Angles thus obtained ought to be accurate within one degree, and suffice for many purposes. It is sometimes of advan tage to attach to the planes to be measured, when quite rough, fragments of thin glass, from which reflections can be obtained ; this must, however, be done with care, to avoid consider able error. COMPOUND, OR TWIN CRYSTALS. Twin crystals are those in which one or more parts regularly arrranged are in reverse position with reference to the other part or parts. They often appear externally to consist of two or more crystals symmetrically united, and sometimes have the form of a cross or star. They7 also exhibit the composition in the reversed arrangement of part of the planes, in the stri\u00e6 of the surface, and in re-entering angles ; in other cases the compound structure is detected only by polarized light. The following figures are examples of the simpler kinds. Fig. 263 is a twinned octahedron with Spinel. Cassiterite. re-entering angles. Fig. 263a represents the regular octahedron divided into two halves by a plane parallel to an octahedral face ; the revolving of the upper half around 180\u00b0 produces the twinned form. Fig. 264 consists of a square prism, with pyramidal terminations, twinned parallel to a diagonal plane between opposite solid angles, as illustrated in f. 261a, a representation of the simple form. A revolution of one of the two halves of f. 264a 1S0\u00b0 about an axis at right angles to the diagonal plane outlined in the figure, would produce the form in fig. 264. Crystals which occupy parallel positions with reference to each other, that is, those whose similar axes and planes are parallel, are not properly called twins ; the term is applied only where the crystals are united in their reversed position in accordance with some deducible mathematical law. In conceiving of them we imagine first the two individuals or portions of the same individual to be in a parallel position, and then a revolution of 180\u00b0 to take place about a certain line, as axis, which will bring them into the twinning position. An exception to the principle in regard to parallel axes is afforded in the case of hemihe dral crystals, in some of which a revolution of 180\u00b0 has the effect of producing an apparently holohedral form, the axes of the parts revolved remaining parallel."], [107, "89 TWIN CRYSTALS. In some cases (e.g.. hexagonal forms), a revolution of 60\u00b0 would produce the twinned form, but in treating of the subject it is better to make the uniform assumption of a revolu tion of 180\"*, which will answer in all cases. It is not to be supposed that twins have actually been formed by such a revolution of the parts of crystals, for the twin is the result of regular molecular growth or enlargement, like that of the simple crystal. This reference to a revolution, and an axis of revolution, is only a convenient means of describing the forms. But while this is true, it is important to ob serve that the hues deduced to explain the twinning of a crystal have, from a molecular standpoint, a real existence. The measurements of Schrauf on twins of cerussite (Tsch. Min. Mitth. , 1873, 209) show the complete correspondence between the actual angles and those required in accordance with the law of twinning. Twinning axis. \u2014 The line or axis about which the revolution of 180\u00b0 is supposed to take place is called the twinning-axis (Zwillingsaxe, Germs), or axis of revolution. The following law has been deduced in regard to this axis, upon which the theory of the whole subject depends : The twinning axis is always a possible crystallographic line, usually either an axis or a normal to some possible crystalline plane. Twinning-plane. \u2014 The plane normal to the axis of revolution is called the twinning-plane (Zwillingsflache, Germs). The axis and plane of twin ning bear the same relation to both individuals in their reversed position ; consequently7 (except in some of hemihedral and triclinic forms) the twin ned crystals are symmetrical with reference to the twinning-plane. Composition-plane. \u2014 The plane by which the reversed crystals is united is the composition-plane or -face (Zusammensetzungsflache. Germs). This and the twinning-plane very commonly coincide ; this is true of the simple examples given above (f. 263, 264) where the plane about which the revolu tion is conceived as having taken place (normal to the twinning axis), and the plane by which the semi-individuals are united, are identical. When not coinciding the two planes are generally at right angles to each cither, that is, the composition face is parallel to the axis of revolution. Examples of this are given beyond (p. 99). Still again, where the crystals are not regularly developed, and where they7 interpenetrate, aud, as it were, exer cise a disturbing influence upon each other, the contact surface may be interrupted, or may be exceedingly irregular. In such cases the axis and plane of twinning have, as always, a definite position, but the composition face has lost its significance. Thus in quartz the interpenetrating parts have 265 often no rectilinear boundary, but mingle in the most irregular manner throughout the mass, and showing this composite irregularity by abrupt variations of the planes at the surface. Fig. 265 exhibits by its shaded part the parts of the plane \u2014 1 that appear over the surface of the plane __?, owing to the interior composi tion. This internal structure of quartz, found in almost all quartz crystals, even the common kinds, is well brought out by means of polarized light ; also, by etching with hydrofluoric acid, the plane \u2014 1 and R becoming etched unequally on the same amount of exposure to the acid. The twinning-plane is, with rare exceptions, a pos- sible occurring plane on the given species, and usually one of the more"], [108, "90 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. frequent or fundamental planes. The exceptions occur only in the triclinic and monoclinic systems, where the twinning axis is sometimes one of the oblique crystallographic axes, and then the plane of twinning normal to it is obviously not necessarily a crystallographic plane, this is conspicuous in albite. In these cases the composition-face is often of more significance than the twinning-plane, the former being distinct and parallel to the axis, in accordance with the principle stated above. With reference to the composition-face, the twinning may be described as taking place (1) by a revolution on an axis at right angles to the composition-face, (2) on an axis parallel to it and vertical, (3) by an axis parallel to it and horizontal ; whether the revolution takes place with the right or left half of the crystal, the twin is right- or left-handed. One further principle is of theoretical importance in the mathematical explanation of the forms. The twinning axis may7, in many cases, be ex changed for another line at right angles with it, a revolution about which will also satisfy the conditions of producing the required form. An exam ple of this is furnished by f . 318, of orthoclase ; the composition-face is parallel to i-i, the axis of revolution also parallel to this plane, and (a) nor mal to i-i, which is then consequently the twinning-plane, though the axis does not coincide with the crystallographic axis, or (b) it may coincide with the vertical axis, and then the twinning-plane normal to it is not a crys tallographic plane. In other simpler cases also, the same principle holds good, generally7 in consequence of the possible mutual interchange of the planes of twinning and composition. In most cases the true twinning-plane is evident, since it is parallel to some plane on the crystal of simple mathe matical ratio. An interesting example of the above principle is furnished by the species staurolite. Fig. 307, p. 98, shows a prismatic twin observed by the author among crystals from Fannin Co., Ga. The measured angle for i-i A i-i' vi-as 701*' 30' ; the twinning-axis deduced from this may be the normal to the plane i-i, which would then be the twinning-plane. Instead of this axis, its complementary axis at right angles to it may be taken, which will equally well produce the observed form. Now in this species it happens that the planes i-i and i-i {over i-i) are almost exactly at right angles (90\u00b0 8') with each other, and hence, according to this latter supposition, i-i becomes the twinn ng-plaue, and the axis of revolution is normal to it. Hence, either .-\u00a7\u25a0 or .-.3 may be the twinning-plane, either supposition agrees closely with the measured angle, which could not be obtained with great accuracy. The former method of twinning (i-i) conforms to the other twins observed on the species, and hence it may be accepted. What is true in this case, however, is not always true, for it will seldom happen that of the two complementary axes each is so nearly normal to a plane of the crystal. In most cases one of the two axes conforms to the law in being a normal to a possible plane, and the other does not, and hence there is no doubt as to which is the true twinning axis. Contact-twins and Penetration-twins. \u2014 In contact-twins, when normally formed, the two halves are simply connate, being united to each other by the composition-face; this is illustrated by f. 263, 264. In actually occur ring crystals the two parts are seldom symmetrical, as demanded by theory, but one may preponderate to a greater or less extent over the other; in some cases only a small portion of the second individual in the reversed position may exist. Very great irregularities are observed in nature in this respect. Moreover, the re-entering angles are often obliterated by the ab normal developments of one or other of the parts, and often only an indis-"], [109, "91 TWIN crystals. tinct line on some of the faces marks the division between the two individuals. Penetration-twins are those in which two or more complete crystals interpenetrate, as it were crossing through each other. Normally, the crystals have a common centre, which is the centre of the axial system for both; practically, however, as in contact-twins, great irregularities occur. Examples of these twins are given in the annexed figures. 266 267 given in the annexed figures, f. 266, of fluorite, and f. 267, of hematite. Other examples occur in the pages following, as, for instance, of the species staurolite, f . 309 to 312, the crystals of which sometimes occur in nature with almost the perfect symmetry7 de manded by theory. It is obvi ous that the distinction between Fluorite. Hematite. , ... x luoriLe. nemaLiLe. contact and penetration-twins is not a very important one, and the line cannot always be clearly drawn between them. Paragenic and Metagenic twins. \u2014 The distinction of paragenic and metagenic twins belongs rather to crystallogeny than crystallography. Yet the forms are often so obviously distinct that a brief notice of the dis tinction is important. in ordinary twins, the compound structure had its beginning in a nucleal compound molecule, or was compound in its very origin ; and whatever inequalities in the result, these are only irregularities in the development from such a nucleus. But in others, the crystal was at first simple ; and afterwards, through some change in itself or in the condition of the mate rial supplied for its increase, received new layers, or a continuation, in a reversed position. This mode of twinning is metagenic, or a result subse quent to the origin of the crystal ; while the ordinary7 mode is varaaenic. One form of it is illustrated in 268 f. 268. The middle portion had attained a length of half an inch or more, and then became genicu lated simultaneously at either extremity. These geniculations are often repeated in rutile, and the ends of the crystal are thus bent into one another, and occasionally produce nearly regular prismatic forms. This metagenic twinning is sometimes presented by the successive layers of deposition in a crystal, as in some quartz crystals, especially amethyst, the inseparable layers, exceedingly thin, being of oppo site kinds. So calcite crystals are sometimes made up of twinned lavers, which are due to an oscillatory Rutile. process of twinning attending the progress of the crystal. In a similar manner, crystals of the triclinic feldspars, albite, etc., are often made up of thin plates parallel to i-i, by oscillatory7 compo sition, and the face 0, accordingly, is finely striated parallel to the edge OAi-i."], [110, "92 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Repeated twinning. \u2014 In the preceding paragraph one case of repeated twinning has been mentioned, that of the feldspars ; it is a case of parallel repetition or parallel grouping of the successive crystals. Another kind is that which is illustrated by f. 295, 297, 311, where the successively reversed individuals are not parallel. In this case the axes may, however, lie in a zone, as the prismatic twins of aragonite, or they may be inclined to each other, as in f. 311, of staurolite. In all such cases where the repeti tion of the twinning tends to produce circular forms, as f. 281, of rutile, the number of individuals is equal to the number of times the angle between the two axial systems is contained in 360\u00b0. For example, five-fold twins occur in the tetrahedrons of gold and sphalerite, since 5 x 70\u00b0 32' (the tetra hedral angle) = 360\u00b0 (approx.). A compound crystal, when there are three individuals, is called a Trilling (Drilling, Germs), where there are four individuals, a Fourling (Vierling, Germ.), etc. Compound cry-stals in which twinning exists in accordance with two laws at once are of rare occurrence ; an excellent example is afforded by stauro lite, f. 312. TheyT have also been observed on albtte (f. 333), orthoclase, chalcocite, and in other less distinct cases. Examples of different methods of Twinning* Isometric System. \u2014 With few exceptions the twins of this system are of one kind, the twinning axis an octahedral axis, and the twinning plane consequently an octahedral plane ; in most cases also the latter coincides Galenite.

Sodalite. Tetrahedrite. Haiiynite. Figs. 274, 275, 276, are twins whose axes are parallel ; these forms are possible only with hemihedral crystals. The twinning asjis is here a dode cahedral axis and the twinning plane a dodecahedral plane. The same method of composition is often seen in dendritic cry-stallizations of native gold and copper, in which the angle of divergence of the branches is 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, the interfacial angles of a dodecahedron. The brownish-black mineral in the mica from Pennsbury, Pa., is magnetite in this form (f. 277), as first observed by G. J. Brush. Tetragonal System. \u2014 The most common method is that where the twin ning-plane is parallel to 1-i. It is especially characteristic of rutile and cassiterite. This is illustrated in f. 264 and similarly in f. 278. Fig. 268 shows a similar twin of rutile, and in f. 281 to 283 the twinning according to this law is repeated. In f. 281 the vertical axes of the successive six individuals lie in a plane, and an enclosed circle is the result ; in f. 282 the successive vertical axes form a zig-zag line ; there are here four individuals,"], [112, "94 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. add four more behind, the last (VIII) uniting with the first (I), and let it be developed vertically, and the complex form produced results in the scalenohedron twin of f. 283.

In the species of the rhombohedral division twins are numerous ; the ordinary methods are the following : the twinning-plane the rhombohe dron R, f. 2S5 ; the rhombohedron \u201427?, f. 288 ; tlie rhombohedron \u2014\\R, f . 2S6. The last mentioned method is common in masses of calcite, where by its frequent repetition it gives rise to thin lamell\u00e6 ; these are observed often in crystalline limestones. Calcite.

This is illustrated in f. 287, a complex penetration twin of chabazite, also f. 267 (hematite), and in f. 2S9, 290. It is also common with quartz, the two crystals sometimes distinct, and joined by a prismatic plane, sometimes interpenetrating each other very irregularly, as shown in f. 265. * G. vom Rath, Pogg.

These may, how ever, be brought into two groups, according as the twinning-plane is (1) a prismatic plane, vertical or horizontal, or '(2) an octahedral plane. The twinning is very often repeated, aud always in accordance with the law already stated, that the number of individuals is determined by the number of times that the angle of the two axial systems is contained in 360\u00b0 (a) Twinning parallel to a prism whose angle is approximately 120\u00b0. 1 Prism vertical. \u2014 The principal examples are aragonite, I A I = 116\u00b0 10'; cerussite, 1 h I = 117\u00b0 13' ; witherite, I A I = 118\u00b0 30'; bromlite, 1 A I = 118\u00b0 50' ; chalcocite, I A 1 = 119\u00b0 35' ; stephanite, I A 1 = 115\u00b0 39' ; dyscrasite, I A I = 119\u00b0 59'. Figs. 291, 292, represent twins of ara gonite in accordance with this law. Figs. 293, 294, show cross-sections of the two prisms of the preceding figures, in the latter the form is hexagonal, though not regularly so. Fig. 295 is a cruciform twin of the same species. 2. Prism horizontal ; that is, a macrodome. \u2014 Examples : arsenopyrite, 14 a \\-'% = 120\u00b0 46' ; leadhillite, 1-\". A 1-1 = 119\u00b0 20' ; 296 humite, type 1. 3.

In all these cases there is a strong tendency toward repetition of the twinning, by which forms often stel late, sometimes apparently hexagonal, result. These forms are illustrated in the following figures : f. 297 is of witherite ; f. 298 a crystal of leadhillite, in its twinned form of very rhombohedral aspect. Figs. 299 and 300 are both chrvsoberyl, where 3-*. is the __W _-l__l <_\"'V.

The genesis of these forms is further illustrated by the following cross-"], [115, "TWIN CRYSTALS. 97 sections.

In f . 303, three rhombic prisms, 7, of aragonite, are combined about their acute angles, the dotted lines showing the outlines of the prisms, and the cross lining the direction of the brachy diagonal ; and in f. 304, four are similarly united. In f . 305, three similar prisms, /, are combined about the obtuse angle. This twin combination may take the form of a hexagonal prism, with or without re-entering angles ; of a three-rayed twin, like f. 301, and if a penetration-twin, of a composite prism, like f. 306 (the num bering of the parts showing the relation), or a six-rayed twin. In all these cases the stellate form depends on the extension of the individuals beyond the normal limits. (b) Prismatic angle approximately that of the regular octahedron, 109\u00b0 28'.

The twins are generally compound, the repetition with the twinning plane sometimes parallel, sometimes oblique, see p. 225.

Examples are furnished by bournonite, 1 A I = 91\u00b0 12', see p. 232, and staurolite. In the latter case the twinning-plane is a brachydome, \u00a7-., and the angle is 91\u00b0 18' ; the form is shown in f. 309, it being that of a nearly rectangular cross. See also phillipsite, p. 323. 2. The twinning-plane may be also an octahedral plane. An excellent example is furnished by staurolite, where the twinning-plane isf-f (f. 310). The crystals cross at angles of nearly 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, hence the form in f. 311, consisting of three individuals (trilling) forming a six-rayed star.

Monoclinic system. \u2014 The following examples comprise the more com monly occurring methods of twinning in this system. (a) The twinning-plane is the orthopinacoid (i-i). This is true in the case of the common twins of orthoclase (f. 318), called the Carlsbad twins. The axis of revolution is normal to i-i (see also p. 90), while the two crystals are united by the clinopinacoid, which is consequently\" the compo sition-face. These twins may be either right- or left-handed (f. 318 or f. 319), according as the right or left half of the simple form (f. 317) has been revolved."], [117, "99 TWIN CRYSTALS. Fig. 313, of pyroxene, is another familiar example ; so also f . 314, of which f. 315 is the simple form. Fig. 320 is a twin of scolecite, where the twin structure is shown by the striations on the clinopinacoid. A form of penetration-twin, with i-i the twinning-plane, is shown in f. 321 (from von Lang). The mode of combi nation and cross-penetration of the two crystals 321 1, 2, is illustrated in f. 322 ; it is a medial section of f. 321 from front to back. (b) The twinning-plane may also be the basal plane. This is common with orthoclase (f. 324); also with gypsum (f. 323). It has also been observed by the author in chondro dite, tvpe II and III, from Brewster, N. Y., see p. 305. (c) Figs. 325, 326, 327 show another method of twinning of orthoclase parallel to the clino dome, 2-\\. These twins are peculiar in that they form nearly rectangular prisms, since Malachite. O A 2-1 = 135\u00b0 3f. They are common among the orthoclase crystals from Baveno, and hence are called Baveno twins. This method of twinning is also common with the amazon-stone of Pike's Peak. The union of four crystals of this kind produces the form represented in f. 325 ; and the same, by penetration, develops the penetration-twin of f. 327 (from v. Rath), which apparently- consists of four pairs of twins, but may be regarded as made by the cross-penetration of the crystals of two pairs, or of the four of f. 325. Forms like f. 325 may have one of the four parts undeveloped and so consist of three united crystals, and also the other parts, as in such com pound twins generally, may be very unequal. Twins corresponding to those of the orthorhombic system, where the twinning-plane is a prism whose angle is nearly 120\u00b0, have been observed by vom Rath in humite, types II and III. Triclinic system. \u2014 In the twins of the triclinic system, the three axea"], [118, "100 crystallography. may be axes of revolution, in which case the twinning-planes are not occur ring crystallographic planes ; or, the pinacoid planes may be the planes of twinning and the normals to them the axes of revolution. Some of the cases are illustrated in the following figures of albite. In f. 329 the brachy pinacoid (i-i) is the twinning-plane ; f. 328 is the same, but it is a penetration-twin ; this is the most common method of twinning with this species. Gypsum. Orthoclase. Orthoclase. Orthoclase. In f. 332 the vertical axis is the twinning-axis. Fig. 333 (from G. Rose) is a do uble twin, the two halves of which are like f. 328, but they are twinned together like f. 332. It happens in albite that the plane angles on i-i, made by the edges I A 0 and I A 1 differ but 37' (the former being 116\u00b0 26', the latter 115\u00b0 55'), and hence it is that in the twin 0 and 1 fall nearly into one plane."], [119, "101 TWIN crystals. Composition parallel to O, where the revolution is on a horizontal axis normal to the shorter diagonal of O, is ex emplified in f. 334 (from G. Rose). Both 384 right- and left-handed twins of this kind occur ; also double twins in which this method is combined with twinning (like that in f. 329, 330), parallel to i-l. A thorough discussion of the method of twinning in the triclinic system has been given by Schrauf iu his monograph of the Albite. species brochantite (Ber. Ak., Wien, lxvii., 275, 1873). Regular Grouping of Crystals. Connected with the subject of twin crystals is that of the parallel posi tion of associated cry-stals of the same species, or of different species. Crystals of the same species occurring together are very commonly in parallel position. In this way large crystals are sometimes built up of smaller individuals grouped together with corresponding planes parallel. This parallel grouping is often seen in crystals as they lie on the support ing rock. On glancing the eye over a surface covered with crystals, a reflection from one face will often be accompanied with reflections from the corresponding face in each of the other crystals, showing that the cry-stals are throughout similar in their positions. Crystals of different species often show the same tendency to parallelism in mutual position. This is true most frequently of species which, from similarity of form and composition, are said to be isomorphous (see p. 177). Crystals of albite, implanted on a surface of orthoclase, are sometimes an example of this ; crystals of hornblende and pyroxene, and of various kinds of mica are also at times observed associated in parallel position. The same relation of position also occasionally occurs where there is no connection in composition, as the crystals of rutile on tabular crystals of hematite, the vertical axes of the former coinciding with the lateral axes of the latter. Breithaupt has figured crystals of calcite, whose rhombo- hedral faces (\u2014 iB) had a series of quartz crystals upon them, all in parallel position (f . 335) ; and Frenzel and vom Rath have described the same association where three such quartz crystals, one on each rhombo hedral face, entirely enveloped the calcite, and uniting with re-entering"], [120, "102 crystallography. angles formed pseudo-twins (rather trillings) of quartz after calcite.^ The author has described a similar occurrence from \" Specimen Mountain, in the Yellowstone Park ; the form is shown in f. 336. (Am. J. Sci., III., xii., 1S76.) IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. The laws of crystallization, when unmodified by extrinsic causes, should produce forms of exact symmetry; the angles being not only equal, but also the homologous faces of crystals and the dimensions in the directions of like axes. This symmetry is, however, so uncommon, that it can hardly be considered other than an ideal perfection. Crystals are very generally distorted, and often the fundamental forms are so completely dis guised, that an intimate familiarity with the possible irregularities is re quired in order to unravel their complexities. Even the angles may occasionally vary rather widely. The irregularities of crystals may be treated of under several heads: 1, Imperfections of surf ace ; 2, Variations of form and dimensions; 3, Variations of angles ; 4, Internal imperfections and impurities. I. Imperfections in the Surfaces of Crystals. 1. Striations or angular elevations arising from oscillatory combina tions. \u2014 The parallel lines or furrows on the surfaces of crystals are called stri\u0153, and such surfaces are said to be striated. Each little ridge on a striated surface is enclosed by two narrow planes more or less regular. These planes often correspond in position to differ ent planes of the crystal, and we may suppose these ridges to have been formed by a continued oscillation in the operation of the causes that give rise, when acting uninterruptedly, to enlarged planes. By this means, the surfaces of a crystal are marked in parallel lines, with a succession of nar row planes meeting at an angle and constituting the ridges referred to. This combination of different planes in the forma- 337 tion of a surface has been termed oscillatory com- bination. The horizontal stri\u00e6 on prismatic crystals of quartz are examples of this combination, in which the oscillation has taken place between the prismatic and pyramidal planes. As the crystals lengthened, there was apparently a continual effort to assume the terminal pyramidal planes, which effort was interruptedly overcome by a strong tendency to an increase in the length of the prism. In this manner, crystals of quartz are often tapered to a point, without the usual pyramidal terminations. Magnetite. Other examples are the striation on the cubic faces of pyrite parallel with the intersections of the cube with the planes of the pyritohedron ; also the striations on magnetite (f. 337) due to the oscillation between the octahedron and dodecahedron."], [121, "103 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. Prisms of tourmaline are very commonly bounded vertically by three convex surfaces, owing to an oscillatory combination of the planes /and _-2. Faces of crystals are often marked with angular elevations more or less distinct, due sometimes also to oscillatory combination. Octahedrons of fluorite are common which have for each face a surface of minute cubes, proceeding from an oscillation between the cube and octahedron. This is a common cause of drusy surfaces with the crystals of many minerals. 2. Striations from oscillatory composition. \u2014 The striations of the plane 0 of albite and other triclinic feldspars, and of the rhombohedral surfaces some calcite, have been attributed, on p. 91, to oscillatory twinning. 3. Markings from erosion and other causes. \u2014 It is not uncommon that the faces of crystals are uneven, or have the crystalline structure developed as a consequence of etching by some chemical agent. Cubes of galenite are often thus uneven, and crystals of lead sulphate or lead carbonate are sometimes present as evidence with regard to the cause. Crystals of numer- ous other species, even of corundum, spinel, quartz, etc., sometimes show the same result of partial change over the surface \u2014 often the incipient stage in a process tending to a final removal of the whole crystal. Interesting in- vestigations have been made by various authors on the action of solvents on different minerals, the actual structure of the crystals being developed in this way. These are referred to again in another place (p. IIS). The markings on the surfaces of crystals are not, however, always to be ascribed to etching. In most cases etchings, as well as the minute angular elevations upon the planes, are a part of the original molecular growth of the crystal, and often serve to show the successive stages in its history. They are the imperfections arising from an interrupted or disturbed de- velopment of the form, the perfectly smooth and even crystalline faces being the result of completed action free from disturbing causes. Ex- amples of the marking referred to occur on the crystals of most minerals, and conspicuously so on the pyramidal planes of quartz. The development of this subject belongs rather to crystallogeny ; refer- ence may, however, be made here to the memoirs of Scharff, bearing on this subject, especially one entitled \" Ueber den Quarz, II., dei Ueber- gangsflachen,\" Frankfort, 1874; also to the Crystallography of Sadebeck (for title see Introduction). It follows from the symmetry of crystallization that like planes should be physically alike, that is in regard to their surface character ; it thus often happens that on all the crystals of a species from a given locality, or perhaps from all localities, the same planes are etched or roughened alike. For example, on crystals of datolite from Bergen Hill, the plane \u2014 2-i is almost uniformly destitute of lustre ; there is much uniformity on the crystals of quartz in this respect. 4. Curved surfaces may result from (a) oscillatory combination ; or (b) some independent molecular condition producing curvatures in the lamin\u00e6 of the crystal ; or (e) from a mechanical cause. Curved surfaces of the first kind have been already mentioned, p. 102. A singular curvature of this nature is seen in f . 339, of calcite ; and another in the same mineral in the lower part of f. 33S, in which traces of a scaleno hedral form are apparent which was in oscillatory combination with the prismatic form."], [122, "104 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Curvatures of the second kind sometimes have all the faces convex. This is the case in crystals of diamond (f. 340), some of which are almost spheres. The mode of curvature, in which all the faces are equally con vex, is less common than that in which a convex surface is opposite and parallel to a corresponding concave surface. Rhombohedrons of siderite (see p. 381) are usually thus curved. The feathery curves of frost on win dows and the flagging stones of pavements in winter are other examples of curves of the second kind. The alabaster rosettes from the Mammoth Cave, Ky., are similar. A third kind of curvature is of mechanical origin. In many species crystals appear as if they had been broken transversely into many pieces, a slight dis placement of which has given a curved form to the prism. This is common in tourmaline and beryd. The beryls of Monroe, Conn., often present these interrupted curvatures, as represented in f . 341 . Crystals not unfrequently occur with a deep pyramidal depression occupying the Beryl, Monroe, Conn. place of each plane, as is often observed in common salt, alum, and sulphur. This is due in part to their rapid growth. II. Variations in the Forms and Dimensions of Crystals. The simplest modification of form in crystals consists in a simple varia tion in length or breadth, without a disparity- in similar secondary planes. The distortion, however, extends very generally to the secondary planes, especially when the elongation of a crystal takes place in the direction of a diagonal, instead of the crystallographic axes. In many instances, one or more planes are obliterated by the enlargement of others, proving a source of much perplexity to the student. The interfacial angles remain constant, unaffected by these variations in form. These changes in form often give rise to what is called by Sadebeck pseudo-symmetry ; the distorted forms of one system appearing similar to the normal forms of another. (Compare the descriptions of the following figures.) As most of the difficulties in the"], [123, "105 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. study of crystals arises from these distortions, this subject is one of great importance. Figs. 342 to 353 represent examples from the isometric system. A cube lengthened or shortened along one axis becomes a right square prism, and if varied in the direction of two axes is changed to a rectangu lar prism. Cubes of pyrite, galenite, fluorite, etc., are generally thus dis torted. It is very unusual to find a cubic crystal that is a true symmetrical cube. In some species the cube or octahedron (or other isometric form) is lengthened into a capillary crj stal or needle, as happens in cuprite and pyrite. An octahedron flatten led parallel to a face, or in the direction of a trigonal interaxis, is reduced to a tabular crystal (f. 342). If lengthened in the same direction, it takes the form in f. 343 ; or if still farther lengthened to the obliteration of A', it becomes an acute rhombohedron (same figure). When an octahedron is extended in the direction of a line between two opposite edges, or that of a rhombic interaxis, it has the general form of a rectangular octahedron ; and still farther extended, as in f . 344, it is changed to a rhombic prism with dihedral summits (spinel, fluorite, magne tite). The figure represents this prism lying on its acute edge. The dodecahedron lengthened in the direction of a diagonal between the obtuse solid angles, that is, that of a trigonal interaxis, becomes a six sided prism with three-sided summits, as in f. 345 ; and shortened in the same direction is a short prism of the same kind (f. 346). Both resemble rhombohedral forms and are common in garnet and zinc blende. When lengthened in the direction of one of the cubic axes, it becomes a square prism with pyramidal summits (f. 347), and shortened along the same axis it is reduced to a square octahedron, with truncated basal angles (f. 34S)."], [124, "106 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. The trapezohedron is still more disguised by its distortions. When elon gated in the line of a trigonal interaxis, it assumes the form in f. 349 ; and still farther lengthened, to the obliteration of some of the planes, becomes a scalene dodecahedron (f. 350). This has been observed in fluor spar. Only twelve planes are here present out of the twenty -four. Threads of native gold from Oregon, are strings of crystals presenting the form of this very acute rhombohedron, with the other planes of the trapezohedron 2-2 (the scalenohedral and the terminal obtuse rhombohedral) quite small at the extremities. If the elongation of the trapezohedron takes place along a cubic axis, it becomes a double eight-sided pyramid with four-sided summits (f. 351) ; or if these summit planes are obliterated by a farther extension, it becomes a complete eight-sided double pyramid (f. 352). A scaleno-dodecahedron of calcite is shown distorted inf. 353, which ap pears, however, to be an eight-sided prism, bounded laterally by the planes 7?, I3, 13, and E, and their opposites, and terminated bv the remaining planes. The following figures of quartz (f. 354, 355) represent distorted forms of this mineral, in which some of the pyramidal faces by enlargement dis place the prismatic faces, and nearly obliterate some of the other pyramidal faces ; see also f. 336. Fig. 356 is a distorted crystal of apatite ; the same is shown in f. 357 with the normal symmetry. The planes between O and the right / are enlarged, while the corresponding planes below are in part obliterated."], [125, "107 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. By observing that similar planes are lettered alike, the correspondence of the two figures will be understood. In deciphering the distorted crystalline forms it must be remembered that while the appearance of the crystals mayr be entirely altered, the angles remain the same ; moreover, like planes are physically alike, that is, alike in degree of lustre, in striations, and so on. Apatite. Apatite. In addition to the variations in form which have just been described, still greater irregularities are due to the fact that, in almost all cases, crystals in nature are attached either to other crystals or to some rock surface, and in consequence of this are only partially developed. Thus quartz crystals are generally attached by an extremity of the prism, and hence have only one set of pyramidal planes ; perfectly formed cry-stals, as those from Herkimer Co., N. Y., having the double pyramid complete, are rare. The same statement may be made for nearly all species. III. Variations in the Angles of Crystals. The greater part of the distortions described occasion no change in the inters acial angles of crystals. But those imperfections that produce con vex, curved, or striated faces, necessarily cause such variations. Further more, circumstances of heat or pressure under which the crystals were formed may sometimes cause not only distortion in form, but also some variation in angle. The presence of impurities at the time of crystallization may also have a like effect. Still more important is the change in the angles of completed crystals which is caused by subsequent pressure on the matrix in which they were formed, as, for example, the change which may take place during the more or less complete metamorphism of the enclosing rock. The change of composition resulting in pseudomorphous crystals (see p. 113) is generally accompanied by an irregular change of angle, so that the pseudomorphs of a species vary much in angle. In general it is safe to affirm that, with the exception of the irregularities"], [126, "108 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. arising from imperfections in the process of crystallization, or from changes produced subsequently, variations in the angles are rare, and the constancy of angle alluded to on p. 87 is the universal law.* In cases where a greater or less variation in angle has been observed in the crystals of the same species from different localities, the cause for this can usually be found in a difference of chemical composition. In the case of isomorphous compounds it is well known that an exchange of correspond ing chemically equivalent elements may take place without a change of form, though usually accompanied with a slight variation in the funda mental angles. The effect of heat upon the form of crystals is alluded to upon p. 164. IV. Internal Imperfections and Impurities. The transparency of crystals is often destroyed by disturbed crystalliza tion, or by impurities taken up from the solution during the process of crystallization. These impurities may- be simply coloring ingredients, or they may be inclosed particles, fluid or solid, visible to the eye or under the microscope. The coloring ingredients may vary in the course of formation of the crystals, and thus layers of different colors result ; the tourmaline crystals of Chesterfield, Mass., have a red centre and blue exterior; others from Elba are sometimes light-green below and black at the extremity ; many other examples might be given. The subject of the fluid and solid inclosures in crystals is one to which much attention has been directed of late years. Attention was early called to its importance by Brewster, who described the presence of fluids in quartz, topaz, beryl, chrysolite, and other minerals. In later years the mat ter has been more thoroughly studied by Sorby, Zirkel, Vogelsang, Fischer, Rosenbusch, and many others. (See Literature, p. 111.) Many crystals contain empty cavities ; in others the cavities are filled sometimes with water, or with the salt solution in which the crystal was formed, and not infrequently, especially in the case of quartz, with liquid carbonic acid, as first proved by Vogelsang. and recently followed out by Hartley. These liquid inclosures are marked as such, in many- cases, by the presence in the cavity of a movable bubble. The solid inclosures are almost infinite in their variety. Sometimes they are large and distinct, and can be referred to known mineral species, as the scales of hematite to which the peculiar character of aventurine feldspar is due. Magnetite is a very common impurity for many minerals, appearing, for example, in the Pennsbury mica ; quartz is also often mechanically mixed, as in staurolite and gmelinite. On the other hand, quartz crystals very commonly inclose foreign material, such as chlorite, tourmaline, rutile, hematite, asbestos, and many other minerals. * Reference must be made here to the discussion by Scacchi of the principle of \" Polysym metry.\" (Atti Accad. Napoli, i., 1864.) See also Hirschwald, Zur KritLk des Leuci-systems, Tsch. Min. Mittb., 1875, 227."], [127, "109 IRREGULARITIES OF CRYSTALS. The inclosures may also consist of a heterogeneous mass of material ; as the granitic matter seen in orthoclase crystals in a porphyritic granite ; or the feldspar, quartz, etc., sometimes inclosed in large coarse crystals of beryl, occurring in granite veins. An interesting example of the inclosure of one mineral by another is afforded by the annexed figures of tourmaline, enveloping orthoclase (E. II. Williams, Am. J. Sci., III., xi., 273, 1876). Fig. 358 shows the crystal of tourmaline ; and cross-sec tions of it at the points indicated (a, b, c) are given by f. 359, 360, 361. The latter show that the feld spar increases in amount in the lower part of the crystal, the tourmaline being merely a thin shell. Similar specimens from the same locality (Port Henry, Essex Co., N. Y.) show that there is no ne cessary connection between the position of the tour maline and that of the feldspar. Similar occurrences are those of trapezohedrons of garnet, where the latter is a mere shell, enclosing calcite, or sometimes epidote. Analogous cases have been explained by some authors as being due to partial pseudomorph ism, the alteration progressing from the centre outward. 359 360 The microscopic crystals observed as inclosures may sometimes be referred to known species, but more generally- their true nature is doubtful. The term microlites, proposed by Vogelsang, is often used to designate the minute inclosed crystals; they are generally of needle-like form, some times quite irregular, and often very remarkable in their arrangement and groupings ; some of them are exhibited in f. 367 and f. 368, as explained"], [128, "110 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. below. Trichite and belonite are names introduced by Zirkel ; the former name is derived from 6pl%, hair, the forms, like that in f. 362, are common in obsidian. Where the minute individuals belong to known species they are called, for example, feldspar microlites, etc. Crystallites is an analogous term which is intended by Vogelsang to cover those minute forms which have not the regular exterior form of crystals, but may be considered as intermediate between amorphous matter and true crystals. Some of the forms, figured by Vogelsang, are shown in f. 363 to 366 ; they are often observed in glassy volcanic rocks, and also in furnace slags. A series of names have been given to varieties of crystallites, such as globulites, margarites, etc.* The microscopic inclosures may also be of an irregular glassy nature ; a kind that exists in crystals which have formed from a melted mass, as lavas, or the slag of iron furnaces. In general, it may be said that while the solid inclosures occur sometimes quite irregularly in the crystals, they are more generally arranged with some evident reference to the symmetry of the form, or planes of the crystals. Examples of this are shown in the following figures : f. 367 ex- hi bits a crystal of augite, inclosing magnetite, feldspar and nephelite microlites, etc.. and f. 368 shows a crystal of leucite, a species whose crystals very commonly inclose foreign matter. Fig. 369 shows a section of a crystal of calcite, containing pyrite. Andalusite. _ Another striking example is afforded by andalusite, in which the inclosed impurities are of considerable extent and remarkably arranged Fig 370 shows the successive parts of a single crystal, as dissected by B.

The greater part of the specimens or masses of minerals that occur, may be described as aggregations of imperfect crystals. Even those whose structure appears the most purely impalpable, and the most destitute in ternally of anything like crystallization, are probably composed of crystal line grains. Under the above head, consequently, are included all the remaining varieties of structure in the mineral kingdom. The individuals composing imperfectly crystallized individuals, may be: 1. Columns, or fibres, in which case the structure is columnar. 2. Thin lamin\u0153, producing a lamellar structure. 3. Grains, constituting a granular structure. 1. Columnar Structure. A mineral possesses a columnar structure when it is made up of slender columns or fibres. There are the following varieties of the columnar struc- ture : Fibrous ; when the columns or fibres are parallel. Ex. gypsum, asbestus. Fibrous minerals have often a silky lustre."], [130, "112 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. Peticulated : when the fibres or columns cross in various directions, and produce an appearance having some resemblance to a net. Stellated or stellular : when they radiate from a centre in all directions, and produce star-like forms. Ex. stilbite, wavellite. Radiated, divergent : when the crystals radiate from a centre, without producing stellar forms. Ex. quartz, stibnite. 2. lamellar Structure. The structure of a mineral is lamellar when it consists of plates or leaves. The lamin\u00e6 may be curved or straight, and thus give rise to the curved lamellar, and straight lamellar structure. Ex. wollastonite (tabular spar), some varieties of gypsum, talc, etc. When the lamin\u00e6 are thin and easily separable, the structure is said to be foliaceous. Mica is a striking example, and the term micaceous is often used to describe this kind of structure. 3. Granular Structure. The particles in a granular structure differ much in size. When coarse, the mineral is described as coarsely granular ; when fine, finely granular; and if not distinguishable by the naked eye, the structure is termed im palpable. Examples of the first may be observed in granular crystalline limestone, sometimes called saccharoidal ; of the second, in some varieties of hematite ; of the last, in chalcedony, opal, and other species. The above terms are indefinite, but from necessity, as there is every degree of fineness of structure in the mineral species, from perfectly im palpable, through all possible shades, to the coarsest granular. The term phanero-crystalline has been used for varieties in which the grains are dis tinct, and crypto-crystalline, for those in which they are not discernible. Granular minerals, when easily crumbled in the fingers, are said to be friable. 4. Imitative Shapes. Reniform : kidney shape. The structure may be radiating or concentric. Botryoidal: consisting of a group of rounded prominences. The name is derived from the Greek fiorpvs, a bunch of grapes. Ex. limonite, chal cedony. Mammillary : resembling the botryoidal, but composed of larger prom inences. Globular : spherical or nearly so ; the globules may consist of radiating fibres or concentric coats. When attached, as they usually are, to the sur face of a rock, they are described as implanted globules. Nodular : in tuberose forms, or having irregular protuberances over the surface. Amygdaloiclal : almond-shaped, applied usually to a greenstone contain ing almond-shaped or sub-globular nodules."], [131, "PSEUDOMORPHOUS CRYSTALS. 113 Coralloidal : like coral, or consisting of interlaced flexuous branchings of a white color, as in some aragonite. Dendritic : branching tree-like. Mossy : like moss in form or appearance. filiform or Capillary : very slender and long, like a thread or hair ; consists ordinarily of a succession of minute crystals. Acicular : slender aud rigid like a needle. Reticulated : net-like. Dnisy : closely covered with minute implanted crystals. Stalactitic: when the mineral occurs in pendant columns, cylinders, or elongated cones. Stalactites are produced by the percolation of water, holding mineral matter in solution, through the rocky roofs of caverns. The evaporation of the water produces a deposit of the mineral matter, and gradually forms a long pendant cylinder or cone. The internal structure mayr be imper fectly crystalline and granular, or may consist of fibres radiating from the central column, or there may be a broad cross-cleavage. Common stalactites consist of calcium carbonate. Chalcedony, gibbsite, brown iron ore, and many other species, also present stalactitic forms. The term amorphous is used when a mineral has not only no crystalline form or imitative shape, but also does not polarize the light even in its minute particles, and thus appears to lie destitute wholly of a crystalline structure internally, as most opal. Such a structure is also called colloid or jelly like, from the Greek for glue. Whether there is a total absence of crystal line structure in the molecules is a debated point. The word is from a, primitive, aud fiopcpij, shape. PSEUDOMORPHOUS CRYSTALS. Every true mineral species has, when crystallized, a form peculiar to itself; occasionally, however, crystals are found that have the form, both as to angles and general habit, of a certain species, and y-et differ from it entirely^ in chemical composition. Moreover it is often seen that, though in outward form complete crystals, in internal structure they are granular, or waxy, and have no regular cleavage. Such crystals are called pseudomorphs, and their existence is explained by the assumption, often admitting of direct proof, that the original min eral has been changed into the new compound, or has disappeared through some agency, and its place been taken by another chemical compound to which the form does not belong. Pseudomorphs have been classed under several heads. 1. Pseudomorphs by substitution. 2. Pseudomorphs by simple deposition, (a) incrustation or (b) infiltra tion. 3. Pseudomorphs by alteration ; and these ma)- be altered (a) without a change of composition, by paramorphism ; (b) by the loss of an ingredient ; (c) by the assumption of a foreign substance ; (d) by a partial exchange of constituents. 8"], [132, "114 CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 1. The first class of pseudomorphs, by substitution, embrace those cases where there has been a gradual removal of the original material and a corresponding and simultaneous replacement of it by another, without, however, any chemical reaction between the two. A common example of this is a piece of fossilized wood, where the original fibre has been replaced entirely by silica. The first step in the process was the filling of all the pores and cavities by the silica in solution, and then as the woody fibre by gradual decomposition disappeared, the silica further took its place. Other examples are quartz after fluorite, calcite, and many other species, cassiterite after orthoclase, etc. 2. Pseudomorphs by incrustation, form a less important class. Such are the crusts of quartz formed over fluorite. In most cases the removal of the original mineral has gone on simultaneously with the deposit of the second, so that the resulting pseudomorph is properly one of substitution. In pseudomorphs by infiltration, a cavity made by the removal of a crystal has been filled by another mineral. 3. The third class of pseudomorphs, by alteration, include a considerable proportion of the observed cases, of which the number is very large. Con clusive evidence of the change which has gone on is often furnished by a kernel of the original mineral in the centre of the altered crystal ; e.g., a kernel of cuprite in a pseudomorphous octahedron of malachite ; also of chrysolite in a pseudomorphous crystal of serpentine ; of corundum in fibrolite. or spinel (Genth). (a) An example of paramorphism is furnished by the change of aragonite to calcite at a certain temperature ; also the paramorphs of rutile after arkansite from Magnet Cove. (b) An example of the pseudomorphs in which alteration is accompanied by a loss of ingredients is furnished by crystals of limonite in the form of siderite, the carbonic acid having been removed ; so also calcite after gay-lussite ; native copper after cuprite. (c) In the change of cuprite to malachite, e.g., the familiar crystals from Chessy, France, an instance is afforded of the assumption of an ingredient, viz., carbonic acid. Pseudomorphs of gypsum after anhy drite occur, where there has been an assumption of water. (d) A partial exchange of constituents, in other words, a loss of one and gain of another, takes place in the change of feldspar to kaolin, in which the potash silicate disappears and water is taken up ; pseudomorphs of chlorite after garnet, pyromorphite after galenite, are other examples. The chemical processes involved in such changes open a wide field for investigation, in which Bischof, Delesse and others have done much."], [133, "SECTION II. PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. The phy-sical characters of minerals are those which relate : I., to Cohesion and Elasticity, that is : cleavage and fracture, hardness, and ten acity ; II. j to the Mass and Volume, the specific gravity ; III., to Light, the optical properties of crystals ; also color, lustre, etc. ; IV., to Heat ; V., to Electricity and Magnetism ; VI., to the action on the Senses, as taste, feel, etc. I. COHESION AND ELASTICITY. By cohesion is understood the resistance which any body makes to an extraneous force tending to separate its particles, either by breaking or scratching. This principle leads to some of the most universally important physical characters of minerals, \u2014 cleavage, fracture, and hardness. Elasticity, on the other hand, is the force which tends to bring the molecules of a body back into their original position, from which they have been disturbed. Upon elasticity depends, for the most part, the degree of tenacity possessed by different minerals. A. Cleavage and Fracture. 1. Cleavage. \u2014 Most crystallized minerals have certain directions in which their cohesive power is weakest, and in which they consequently yield most readily to an exterior force. This tendency to break in the direction of certain planes is called cleavage, and being most intimately connected with the crystalline form it has already been necessary to define it, and to mention some of its most important features (p. 2). Cleavage differs (a) according to the ease with which it is obtained, and (b) accord ing to its direction, crystallographically determined. (a) Cleavage is called perfect or eminent when it is obtained with great ease, affording smooth, lustrous surfaces, as in mica, topaz, calcite. Inferior degrees of cleavage are spoken of as distinct, indistinct or imperfect, inter rupted, in traces, difficult. These terms are sufficiently intelligible without further explanation. It may be noticed that the cleavage of a species is sometimes better developed in some of its varieties than in others. (b) Cleavage is also named according to the direction, crystallographically defined, which it takes in a species. When parallel to the basal section (0) it is called basal, as in topaz ; parallel to the prism, as in amphibole, it is called prismatic ; also macrodiagonal, orthodiagonal, etc., when parallel to the several diametral sections ; parallel to the faces of the cube, octa-"], [134, "116 physical characters of minerals. hedron, dodecahedron, or rhombohedron, it is called cubic, as galenite ; octahedral, as fluorite ; dodecahedral, as sphalerite ; rhomb ohedr al, as calcite. Intimately connected with the cleavage of crystallized minerals are the divisional planes in vestigated by Reusch (see Literature, p. 1 18). He has found that by pressure, or by a sudden blow, divisional planes are in many cases produced which are analogous to the cleavage planes. The first he calls Gleitflachen, or planes in which a sliding of the molecules upon each other takes place. Thus, for example, if two opposite dodecahedral edges of a cubic cleavage mass of rock-salt are regularly filed away, and the mass then subjected to pressure in this direction, a Gleitfldche is obtained parallel to the dodecahedral face. The figures, on the other hand, obtained by a blow on a rounded steel point, placed perpen dicular to the natural or cleavage face of a crystal, are called by him fracture-figures (Schlag flj-uren). The divisional-planes in this case appear as cracks diverging from the point where the blow has been made. For instance, on a cubic face of rock-salt two planes, forming a rectangular cross, are obtained ; on biaxial mica, a six-rayed (sometimes three-rayed) star results from the blow, one ray of which is always parallel to the brachy diagonal axis of the prism. 2. Fracture. \u2014 The term fracture is used to define the form or kind of surface obtained by breaking in a direction other than that of the cleavage in crystallized minerals, and in any direction in massive minerals. When the cleavage is highly perfect in several directions, as the cubic cleavage of galenite, fracture is often not readily- obtainable. Fracture is defined as : (a) Conchoidal ; when a mineral breaks with curved concavities, more or less deep. It is so called from the resemblance of the concavity to the valve of a shell, from concha, a shell ; flint. (b) Even ; when the surface of fracture, though rough, with numerous small elevations and depressions, still approximates to a plane surface. (c) Uneven ; when the surface is rough and entirely- irregular. (d) Hadley ; when the elevations are sharp, or jagged ; broken iron. Other terms also employed are earthy, splintery, etc. B. Hardness. By the hardness of a mineral is understood the resistance which it offers to abrasion. The degree of hardness is determined by observing the ease or difficulty with which one mineral is scratched by another, or by a file or knife. In minerals there are all grades of hardness, from that of a substance impressible by the finger-nail to that of the diamond. To give precision to the use of this character, a scale of hardness was introduced by Mohs. It is as follows : 1. Talc; common laminated light-green variety. 2. Gypsum ; a crystallized variety. 3. Calcite; transparent variety. 4. Fluorite ; crystalline variety. 5. Apatite ; transparent variety. (5.5. Scapolite ; crystalline variety.) 6. Feldspar (orthoclase) ; white cleavable variety. 7. Quartz; transparent."], [135, "117 HARDNESS TENACITY. 8. Topaz ; transparent. 9. Sapphire ; cleavable varieties, 10. Diamond. If the mineral under trial is scratched by the file or knife as easily as apatite, its hardness is called 5 ; if a little more easily than apatite and not so readily as fluorite, its hardness is called 4.5, etc. For minerals as hard or harder than quartz, the file will not answer, and the relative hard ness is determined by finding by experiment whether the given mineral will scratch, or can be scratched by, the successive minerals in the scale. It need hardly be added that great accuracy is not attainable by the above methods, though, indeed, for all mineralogical purposes exactness is quite unnecessary. The interval between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6, in the scale of Mobs, being a little greater than between the other numbers, Breithaupt proposed a scale of twelve minerals ; but the scale of Mobs is now universally accepted. Accurate determinations of the hardness of minerals have been made by Frankenheim, Franz, Grailich and Pekarek, and others (see Literature, p. 118), with an instrument called a sclerometer. The mineral is placed on a movable carriage with the surface to be experimented upon horizontal ; this is brought in contact with a steel point (or diamond-point), fixed on a support above; the weight is then determined which is just sufficient to move the carriage and produce a scratch on the surface of the mineral. By means of such an instrument the hardness of the different faces of a given crystal has been determined in a variety of cases. It has been found that different planes of a crystal differ in hardness, and the same plane dif fers as it is scratched in different directions. In general, the hardest plane is that which is intersected by the plane of most complete cleavage. And of a single plane, which is intersected by cleavage planes, the direction perpendicular to the cleavage direction is the softer, those parallel to it the harder. This subject has been recently investigated by Exner (p. 118), who has given the form of the curves of hardness for the different planes of many crystals. These curves are obtained as follows : the least weight required to scratch a crystalline surface in different directions, for each 10\" or 15\u00b0, from 0\u00b0 to 18b***, is determined with the sclerometer; these directions are laid off as radii from a centre, and the length of each is made proportional to the weight fixed by experiment, that is, to the hardness thus determined ; the line connecting the extremities of these radii is the curve of hardness for the given plane. C. Tenacity. Solid minerals may be either brittle, sectile, malleable, flexible, or elastic. (a) Brittle ; when parts of a mineral separate in powder or grains on attempting to cut it ; calcite. (b) Sectile ; when pieces may be cut off with a knife without falling to powder, but still the mineral pulverizes under a hammer. This character is intermediate between brittle and malleable ; gypsum. (c) Malleable ; when slices may be cut off, and these slices flattened out under a hammer; native gold, native silver. (d) Flexible ; when the mineral will bend, and remain bent after the bendino- force is removed ; talc."], [136, "118 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. (e) Elastic ; when after being bent, it will spring back to its original position ; mica. The elasticity of crystallized minerals is a subject of theoretical rather than practical importance. The subject has been acoustically investigated by Savart with very interesting results. Reference may also be made to the investigations of Neumann, and later those of Voigt and Groth. The most important principle established by these researches is, as stated by Groth, that in crystals the elasticity (coefficient of elasticity) differs in different directions, but is the same in all directions which are crystallo graphically identical ; hence he gives as the definition of a crystal, a solid in which the elasticity is a function of the direction. Intimately connected with the general subjects here considered, of cohesion in relation to minerals, are the figures produced by etching on crystalline faces (Aetzfiguren, Germ), investigated by Leydolt, and later by Baumhauer, Exner, and others. This method of investi gation is of high importance as revealing the molecular structure of the crystal ; reference, however, must be made to the original memoirs, whose titles are. given below, for the full discussion of the subject. The etching is performed mostly by solvents, as water in some cases, more generally the ordinary mineral acids, or caustic alkalies, also by steam and hydrofluoric acid ; the latter is especially powerful in its action. The figures produced are in the majority of cases angular depressions, such as low triangular, or quadrilateral pyramids, whose outlines run parallel to some of the crystalline edges. In some cases the planes produced can be referred to occur ring crj-stallographic planes. They appear alike on similar planes of crystals, and hence serve to distinguish different forms, perhaps in appearance identical, as the two sets of planes in the ordinary double pyramid of quartz ; so, too, they reveal the compound twinning struc ture common on some crystals, as quartz (p. 89) and aragonite. Analogous to the etching-figures are the figures produced on the faces of some crystals by the loss of water (Verwitterungsfiguren, Germ.) This subject has been investigated by Pape (see below).

SBECIFIC GRAVITY. The specific gravity of a mineral is its weight compared with that of an other substance of equal volume, whose gravity is taken at unity. In the case of solids or liquids, this comparison is usually made with water. If a cubic inch of any mineral weighs twice as much as a cubic inch of water (water being the unit), its specific gravity is 2, if three times as much, its specific gravity is 3, etc. The direct comparison by weight of a certain volume of water with an equal volume of a given solid is not often practicable. By making use, however, of a familiar principle in hydrostatics, viz., that the weight lost by a solid immersed in water is equal to the weight of an equal volume of water, that is of the volume of water it displaces, \u2014 the determination of the specific gravity becomes a very simple process. The weight of the solid out of water (w) is determined by weighing in the usual manner ; then the weight in water is found (wr), when the loss by immersion or the difference of the two weights (w \u2014 w') is the weight of a volume of water equal to that of the solid ; finally the quotient of the first weight (w) by that of the equal volume of water as determined (w \u2014 \u2022__>') is the specific gravity (G). G=-^\u2014, w \u2014 w Hence, For example, the weight of a fragment of quartz is found to be 4.534 grams. Its weight in water = 2.817 grains, and therefore the loss of weight, or the weight of an equal volume of water = 1.717. Consequently 4 534 the specific gravity is equal to or 2.641. The ordinary method for obtaining the specific gravity of firm, solid minerals is first to weigh the specimen accurately on a good chemical bal ance, then suspend it from one pan of the balance by a horse-hair, silk thread, or better still by a fine platinum wire, in a glass of water con veniently- placed beneath. The platinum wire may be wound around the specimen, or where the latter is small it may be made at one end into a little sp.iral support. While thus suspended, the weight is again taken with the same care as before. The water employed for this purpose should be distilled, to free it from all foreign substances. Since the density of water varies with its tempera ture, a particular temperature has to be selected for these experiments, in"], [138, "120 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. order to obtain uniform results : 60\u00b0 F. is the most convenient, and has been generally adopted. But the temperature of the maximum density of water, 39.5\u00b0 F. (4\u00b0 C), has been recommended as preferable. For minerals soluble in water some other liquid, as alcohol, benzene, etc., must be em ployed, whose specific gravity (g) is accurately known ; from the com parison with it, the specific gravity (G) of the mineral as referred to water is determined, as by the formula : G= W w \u2014 w 'J- A very convenient form of balance is the spiral balance of Jolly, where the weight is mea sured by the torsion of a spiral brass wire. The readings, which give the weight of the min eral in and out of water, are obtained by observing the coincidence of the index with its image reflected in the mirror on which the graduation is made. A form of balance in which weights are also dispensed with, the specific gravity being read off from a scale without calculation, has recently been described by Parish (Am. J. Sci., III., x., 352). Where great accuracy is not required, it can be very conveniently used. If the mineral is not solid, but pulverulent or porous, it is best to reduce it to a powder and weigh it in a little glass bottle (f. 373) 373 called a pygnometer. This bottle has a stopper which fits tightly and ends in a tube with a very fine opening. The bottle is filled with distilled water, the stopper in serted, and the overflow-ing water carefully removed with a soft cloth. It is now weighed, and also the mineral whose density is to be determined. The stopper is then removed and the mineral in powder or in small fragments inserted, with care, so as not to introduce air-bubbles. The water which overflows on replacing the stopper is the amount of water displaced by the mineral. The weight of the pygnometer with the enclosed mineral is determined, and the weight of the water lost is obviously _ . , \u2014 ..~-^ \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 .- \u2014 ~- -~ \u2014 -. the difference between this last weight and that of the bottle and mineral together, as first determined. The specific gravity of the mineral is equal to its weight alone divided by the weight of the equal volume of water thus determined. Where this method is followed with sufficient care, especially avoiding any change of temperature in the water, the results are quite accurate. Other methods of determining the specific gravity will be found described in the literature notices which follow. It has been shown by Rose that chemical precipitates have uniformly a higher density than belongs to the same substance in a less finely divided state. This increase of density also characterizes, though to a less extent, a mineral in a fine state of mechanical subdivision. \"This is explained by the condensation of the water on the surface of the powder. It may also be mentioned that the density of many substances is altered by fusion. The same mineral in different states of molecular aggregation may differ somewhat in density. Furthermore, minerals having the same chemical composition have sometimes different densities corresponding to the different crystalline forms in which they appear (see p. 177)."], [139, "121 LIGHT. For all minerals in a state of average purity the specific gravity is one of the most important and constant characteristics, as urged especially by Breithaupt. Every chemical analysis of a mineral should be accompanied by a careful determination of its density. Practical suggestions. \u2014 The fragment taken should not be too large, say from two to five grams for ordinary cases, varying somewhat with the density of the mineral. The substance must be free from impurities, internal and external, and not porous. Care must be taken to exclude air-bubbles, aud it will often be found well to moisten the surface of the specimen before inserting it in the water, and sometimes boiling is necessary to free it from air. If it absorbs water this latter process must be allowed to go on till the substance is fully satu rated. No accurate determinations can be made unless the changes of temperature are rigorously excluded and the actual temperature noted. In a mechanical mixture of two constituents in known proportions, when the specific gravity of the whole and of one are known, that of the other can be readily obtained. This method is often important in the study of rocks. Literature. \u2014 Specific Gravity. Beudant. Pogg. Ann., xiv., 474. 1828. Jenzsch.

Before considering the distinguishing optical p roperties of crystals of the different systems, it is desirable to review briefly some of the more im- portant principles of optics upon which the phenomena in question depend. Nature of light. \u2014 In accordance with the undulatory theory of Huy- ghens, as further developed by Young and Fresnel, light is conceived to consist in the vibrations, transverse to the direction of propagation, of the particles of imponderable, elastic ether, which it is assumed pervades all space as well as all material bodies. These vibrations are propagated with great velocity in straight lines and in all directions from the luminous point, and the sensation which they produce on the nerves of the eye is called light. The nature of the vibrations will be understood from f. 374. If AB represents the direction of propagation of the light-ray, each particle of ether vibrates at right angles to this as a line of equilibrium. The vibra-"], [140, "122 physical characters of minerals. tion of the first particle induces a similar movement in the adjacent par ticle ; this is communicated to the next, and so on. The particles vibrate successively from the line AB to a distance corresponding to bb' , called the amplitude of the vibration, then return to b and pass on to b\", and so 374 on. Thus at a given instant there are particles occupying all positions, from that of the extreme distance V , or c , from the line of equilibrium to that on this line. In this way the wave of vibration moves forward, while the motion of the particles is only- transverse. In the figure the vibrations are represented in one plane only-, but in ordinary light they take place in all directions about the line AB. The distance between any two particles, which are in like positions, of like phase, as V and c' , is called the wave- length ; and the time required for this completed movement is called the time of vibration. The intensity of the light varies with the amplitude of the vibrations, and the color depends upon the length of the waves ; the wave-lengths of the violet rays are shorter than those of the red rays. Two waves of like phase, propagated in the same direction and of equal intensity, on meeting unite to form a wave of double intensity (double amplitude). If the waves differ in phase by half a wave-length, or an odd multiple of this, they interfere and extinguish each other. For other rela- tions of phase they are also said to interfere, forming a new resultant wave, differing iii phase and amplitude from each of the component waves ; if they are waves of white light, their interference is indicated by the appear- ance of the successive colors of the spectrum. The propagation of the vibration- waves of light is sometimes compared to the effect produced when a pebble is thrown in a sheet of quiet water \u2014 a series of concentric circular waves are sent out from the point of agitation. These waves con- sist in the transverse vibration of the particles of water, the waves move forward, but the water simply vibrates to and fro vertically. The waves of light are propagated forward, in an analogous manner, in all directions from the luminous point, and the surface which contains all the particles which commence their vibrations simultaneously is called the wave-surface (Wellenflache, Germs). If the propagation of light goes on with the same velocity in all direc- tions in a homogeneous medium, the wave-surface is obviously that of a sphere and the medium is said to be isotrope. If it takes place with dif- ferent velocities in different directions in a body, the wave-surface is some- times an ellipsoid, but never spherical, as is shown later; such a body is called an isotrope. All the phenomena of optics are explained upon the supposition of waves of light, whose change of direction accompanies refraction, whose interfer ence produces the colored bands of the diffraction spectra, etc. For the full discussion of the subject reference must be made to works on optics."], [141, "123 refraction of light. Refraction. \u2014 A ray of light passing through a homogeneous medium is always propagated in a straight line without deviation. When, however, the light-ray passes from one medium to another, which is of different density7, it suffers a change of direction, which is called refraction. For in stance, in f. 375, if ca is a ray of light passing from air into water, its path will be changed after passing the surface at a, and it will continue in the direction ab. Conversely, if a ray of light, ba, pass from the denser medium, water, into the rarer medium, air, at a, it will take the direction ac. If now mao is a perpendicular to the sur face at a, it will be seen that the angle cam, called the angle of incidence (i) of the ray ca is greater than the angle bao, called the angle of refraction (r), and what is observed in this case is found to be universally true, and the law is expressed as follows : A ray of light in passing from a rarer to a denser medium is refracted towards the perpendicular ; if from a denser to a rarer medium it is refracted away from the perpendicular. A further relation has also been established by experiment : however great or small the angle of incidence, cam (i), may be, there is always a constant relation between it and the angle of refraction, gam (r), for two given substances, as here for air and water. This is seen in the figure where as and da are the sines of the two angles, and their ratio (= \u25a0\u00a7\u2022 nearly) is the same as that of the sine of any other angle of incidence to the sine of its angle of refraction. This principle is expressed as follows: The sine of the angle of incidence bears a constant ratio to the sine of the angle of res ruction. This constant ratio between these two angles is called the index of refrac tion, or simply n. In the example given for air and water - \u2014 = 1.335, r J l & sm r and consequently the value of the index of refraction, or .., is 1.335. The following table includes the values of n for a variety of substances. For all crystallized minerals, except those of the isometric system, the index of refraction has more than one value, as is explained in the pages which follow. Ice 1.308 Calcite 1.654 Water 1.335 Aragonite 1.693 Fluorite 1.436 Boracite 1.701 Alum 1.457 Garnet 1.815 Chalcedony 1.553 Zircon 1.961 Rock-salt 1.557 Blende 2.260 Quartz 1.548 Diamond 2.419 Sill % In the principle which has been stated, -. \u2014 = n, two points are to be * sin r"], [142, "124 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. noted. First, if the angle i = 0\u00b0, then sin i = 0, and obviously also r = 0, in other words, when the ray of light coincides with the perpendicular no refraction takes place, the ray proceeding onward into the second medium without deviation. Again, if the angle i = 90\u00b0, then sin i = 1, and the equation above be comes = n or sin r = - . As n has a fixed value for every substance, sin r n it is obvious that there will also be a corresponding value of the angle r for the case mentioned. From the above table it is seen that for water sili r = \u2014 \u2014 , and r - 48\u00b0 35' ; for diamond, sin r = \u2014\u2014, and r = 24\u00b0 25'. l.OOO tCx-j In the example employed above, if the angle bao (r) = 48\u00b0 35', the line ac will coincide with as supposing the light to go from b to a. If r is greater than 48\u00b0 35', the ray no longer \"passes from the water into the air, but suffers total refection at the surface a. This value of r is said to be the limiting value for the given substance. The smaller it is the greater the amount of light reflected, and the greater the apparent brilliancy of the substance in question. This is the explanation of the brilliancy of the diamond. Determination of the index of refraction. \u2014 By means of a prism, as MlSt in r. oTb, it is possible to determine the value of n, or index of refraction of a given substance. The full explanation of this subject belongs to works on optics, but a word is devoted to it here. If the material is solid, a prism must be cut and polished, with its edge in the proper direction, and having not too small an angle. If the refrac tive index of a liquid is required, it is placed 376 a within a hollow prism, with sides of plates of glass having both surfaces parallel. The angle of the prism, MNP (a), is, in each case, measured in the same manner as the angle between two planes of a crystal, and then the minimum amount of deviation (8) of & monochromatic ray of light passing from a slit through the prism is also determined. The amount of deviation of a ray in passing through the prism varies with its position, but when the prism is so placed that the ray makes equal angles with the sides of the prism (*. = is , f. 376), both when entering and emerging, this deviation has a fixed minimum value. If 8 = the minimum deviation of the ray-, and a = the angle of the prism, then ?. = -. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -. b * sin iS In determining the value of n for different colors, it is desirable to employ rays of known position in the spectrum. Double refraction. \u2014 Hitherto the existence of only one refracted ray- has been assumed when light passes from one medium to another. But it is a well-known fact that there are sometimes two refracted rays. The most familiar example of this is furnished by the mineral calcite, also called on account of this property7 \" doubly-refracting spar.\" If mnop (f. 377) be a cleavage piece of calcite, and a ray of light meets"], [143, "125 REFLECTION, DISPERSION AND DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT. it at b, it will, in passing through, be divided into two rays, be, bd. Similarly a line seen through a piece of calcite ordi- \u2022J IT) \u00b1 narily appears double. It will be seen, however, that the same property is enjoyed by the great majority of crystallized minerals, though in a less striking degree. Reflection. \u2014 When a ray of light passes from one medium to another, for example, from air to a denser substance, as has been illustrated, the light will be par- tially transmitted and refracted by the latter, in the manner illustrated, but a portion of it (the ray ag, in f. 375), is always reflected back into the air. The direction of the reflected ray is known in accordance with the following law : The angles of incidence and reflection are equal. \u2014 In f. 37S the angle cam is equal to the angle mag. The relative amount of light reflected and transmitted depends upon the angle of incidence, and also upon the transparency of the second medium. If the surface of the latter is not perfectly polished, diffuse reflection will take place, and there will be no distinct reflected ray. Still another important principle, in relation to the same subject, remains to be enunciated: The rays of incidence, reflection, and refraction all lie in the same plane. Dispersion. \u2014 Thus far the change in direction which a ray of light suffers on refraction has alone been considered. It is also true that the amount of refraction differs for the different colors of which ordinary white light is composed, being greater for blue than for red. In consequence of this fact, if a ray of ordinary light pass through a prism, as in f. 376, it will not only be refracted, but it will also be separated into its component colors, thus forming the spieetrum. This variation for the different colors depends directly upon their wave- lengths ; the red rays have longer waves, and vibrate more slowly-, and hence suffer less refraction than the violet rays, for which the wave-lengths are shorter and the velocity greater. Interference of light ; diffraction . \u2014 When a ray of monochromatic light is made to pass through a narrow slit, or by the edge of an opaque body, it is diffracted, and there arise, as may be observed upon an appropriately- placed screen, a series of dark and light bands, growing fainter on the outer limits. Their presence, as has been intimated, is explained in accordance with the undulatory theory of light, as due to the interference, or mutual reaction of the adjoining waves of light. If ordinary light is employed, the phenomena are the same and for the same causes, except that the bands are successive spectra. Diffraction gratings, consisting of a series of ex- tremely fine lines very closely ruled upon glass, are employed for the same purpose as the prism to produce the colored spectrum. The familiar phenomena of the colors of thin plates and of Newton's rings depend upon the same principle of the interference of the light waves. This subject is one of the highest importance in its connection with the optical properties of crystals, since the phenomena observed when they are viewed, under certain circumstances, in polarized light are explained in an analogous manner. (Compare the colored plate, p. 144.)"], [144, "126 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. Polarization by reflection. \u2014 By polarization is understood, in general, that change in the character of reflected or transmitted light which dimin ishes its power of being further reflected or transmitted. In accordance with the undnlatory theory of light a ray of polarized light is one whose vibrations take place in a single plane only. Suppose (f. 378) mn and op to be two parallel mirrors, say simple polished pieces of black glass ; a ray of light, AB, 378 will be reflected from mn in the direction B C, and meeting op, will be again reflected to D. When, as here, the two mirrors are in a parallel position, the plane of reflection is clearly the same for both, the angles of incidence are equal, and the rays AB and CD are parallel. The ray CD is polarized, although this does not show itself to the eye direct. Now let the mirror, op, be revolved about BC as an axis, and let its position otherwise be un changed, so that the angles of incidence still remain equal, it will be found that the reflected ray-, CD, loses more and more of its brilliancy as the revolution continues, and when the mirror, op. occupies a position at right angles to its former position, the amount of light reflected will be a minimum, the planes of reflection being in the two cases perpendicular to one another. If the revolution of the mirror be continued with the same conditions as before, and in the same direction, the reflected raj- will become brighter and brighter till the mirror has the position indicated by the dotted line, o'p', when the planes of reflection again coincide, and the reflected ray, L'I>', is equal in brilliancy to that previously obtained for the position CD. The same diminution to a minimum will be seen if the revolution is con tinued 90\u00b0 farther, and the reflected ray again becomes as brilliant as before when the mirror resumes its first position op. In the above description it was asserted that, when the planes of inci dence of the mirrors were at right angles to each other, the amount of light reflected would be less than in any other position, that is a minimum. For one single position of the mirrors, however, as they thus stand perpendicular to each other, that is for one single value of the angle of incidence, the light will be practically extinguished, and no reflected ray will appear from the second mirror. The angle of incidence, ABH, for this case is called the angle of polar ization, and its value varies for different substances. It was shown further by Brewster that, : The angle of polarization is that angle whose tangent is the index of refraction of the reflecting substance, i.e., tan i = n. Exactly the same phases of change would have been observed if the upper mirror had been revolved in a similar manner. The first mirror is often called the polarizer, the second the analyzer. This change which the light suffers in this case, in consequence of re flection, is e&[\\ed polarization. In order to give a partial explanation of this phenomenon and to make"], [145, "127 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT. the same subject intelligible as applied to other cases in which polarization occurs, reference must be made to the commonly received theory of the nature of light already defined. The phenomena of light are explained, as has been stated, on the assump tion that it consists of the vibrations of the ether, the vibrations being transverse, that is in a plane perpendicular, to the direction in which the light is propagated. These vibrations in ordinary light take place in all directions in this plane at sensibly the same time ; strictly speaking, the vibrations are considered as being always transverse, but their directions are constantly and instantaneously changing in azimuth. Such a ray of light is alike on all sides or all around the line of propagation, AB, f. 374. A ray of completely polarized light, on the other hand, has vibrations in one direction only, that is in a single plane. These principles may be applied to the case of reflection already de scribed. The ray of ordinary light, AB, has its vibrations sensibly simul taneous in all directions in the pflane at right angles to its line of propaga tion, while the light reflected from each mirror has only those vibrations which are in one direction, at right angles to the plane of reflection \u2014 supposing that the mirrors are so placed that the angle of incidence (ABH) is also the angle of polarization. If the mirror occupy the position represented in f. 378, the ray of light, BC, after being reflected by the first mirror, mn, contains that part of the vibrations whose direction is normal to its plane of reflection called the plane of polarization. This is also true of the second mirror, and when they are parallel and their planes of reflection coincide, the ray of light is reflected a second time without additional change. If, however, the second mirror is revolved in the way described '(p. 126), less and less of the light will be reflected by it, since a successively smaller part of the vibrations of the ray BC take place in a direction normal to its plane of reflection. And when the mirrors are at right angles to each other, after a revolution of op 90\u00b0 about the line BC as. an axis, no part of the vibrations of the ray __?6'are in the plane at right angles to the reflec tion-plane of the second mirror, and hence the light is extinguished. By reference to f. 375 this subject may be explained a little more broadly. It was seen that of the ray ca, meeting the surface of the water at a, part is reflected and part transmitted in accordance with the laws of reflection and refraction. It has been shown further that the reflected ray is polar ized, that is, it is changed so that the vibrations of the light take place in one direction, at right angles to the plane of incidence. It is also true that the refracted ray is polarized, it containing only those vibrations which were lost in the reflected ray, that is, those which coincide with the plane of incidence and reflection. It was stated that the vibrations of the polarized reflected ray take place at right angles to the plane of polarization. This is the assumption which is commonly made ; but all the phenomena of polarization can be equally well explained upon the other supposition that they coincide with this plane. The separation of the ray of ordinary light into two rays, one reflected the other refracted, vibrating at right angles to each other, takes place most completely when the reflected and refracted rays are 90\u00b0 from one another,"], [146, "128 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. as proved by Brewster. From this fact follows the law already stated, that the tangent of the angle of polarization is equal to the index of re fraction. The angle of polarization for glass is about 54\u00b0 35'. This separation is in no case absolutely complete, but varies with differ ent substances. In the case of opaque substances the vibrations belonging to the refracted ray are more or less completely absorbed (compare remarks on color, p. 164). Metallic surfaces piolarize the light very slightly. Polarization by means of thin plates of glass.\u2014It has been explained that the light which has been transmitted and refracted is always at least in part polarized. It will be readily understood from this fact that when a number of glass plates are placed together, the light which passes through them all will be more and more completely polarized as their number is increased. This is a second convenient method of obtaining polarized light. Polarization by means of tourmaline plates.\u2014The phenomena of polar ized light may- also be shown by means of tourmaline plates. If from a crystal of tourmaline, which is suitably transparent, two sections be obtained, each cut parallel to the vertical axis, it will be found that these, when placed together with the direction of their axes coinciding, allow the light to pass through. If, however, one section is revolved upon the other, less and less of the light is transmitted, until, when their axes are at right angles (90\u00b0) to each other, the light is (for the most part) extin guished. As the revolution is continued, more and more light is obtained through the sections, and after a revolution of 180\u00b0, the axes being again parallel, the appearance is as at first. A further revolution (270\u00b0) brings the axes again at right angles to each other, when the light is a second time extinguished, and so on around. The explanation of these phenomena, so far as it can be is given here, analogous to that employed for the case of polarization by re flection. Each plate so affects the ray of light that, after having passed through it there exist vibrations in one direction only, and that parallel to the vertical axis, the other vibrations being absorbed. If now the two plates are placed in the same position, abdc, and efgh (f. 379), the light passes through both in succession. If, however, the one is turned upon the other, \u00b0n\\y that portion of the light can pass through which vibrates still in the direction ac. This portion is determined by the resolution of the vibrations in accordance with the existing principle of the parallelogram of forces. Consequently, when the sections stand, at to each other the amount of right angles (f. 380) transmitted light is nothing (not strictly true), that is, the light is extinguished. The tourmaline plates, which have been described, are mounted in pieces of cork and held in a kind of wire rinrrl> <\u25a0* :;s|>* The object to be examined is placed between them and supported there by the spring in the wire. In use are held close to theand in they eye, this position the object is viewed in converging polarized light. Polarization by means of Nicol prisms. \u2014The most convenient method of obtaining polarized light is by means of a Nicol prism of calcite. A"], [147, "POLARIZATION OF LIGHT. 129 cleavage rhombohedron of calcite (the variety Iceland spar is universally used in consequence of its transparency) is obtained, having four large and two small rhombohedral faces opposite each other. In place of the latter 381 planes two new surfaces are cut, making angles of 68\u00b0 (instead of 71\u00b0) with the obtuse vertical edges ; these then form the terminal faces of the prism. In addition to this, the prism is cut through in the direction HH (f. 382), the parts then polished and cemented together again with Canada balsam. A ray of light, ab, entering the prism is divided into two ray-s polarized at right angles to each other. One of these, be, on meeting the layer of balsam (whose refractive index is greater than that of calcite) suffers total reflection (p. 124), and is deflected against the blackened sides of the prism and extinguished. The other passes through and emerges at e, a completely polarized ray- of light, that is, a ray with vibrations in one direction only, and that the direction of the shorter diagonal of the prism (f. 383). It is evident that two Nicol prisms can be used together in the same way as the two tourmaline plates, or the two mirrors; one is called the polarizer, and the other the analyzer. The plane of polarization of the Nicol prisms has the direction PP (f. 383) at right angles to which the vibrations of the light take place. A ray of light pass ing through one Nicol will be extinguished by a second when its plane of polarization is at right angles to that of the first prism ; in this case the Nicols are said to be 382 f crossed. The Nicol prisms have the great advantage over the tourmaline plates, that the light they transmit is uncolored and more completelv polarized. Either a tourmaline plate or a Nicol prism 383 may also be used in connection with a reflecting mirror. The light reflected by such a mirror vibrates in a plane at right angles to the plane of incidence (plane of polarization); that trans mitted by the Nicol prism vibrates in the direc tion of the shorter diagonal (f. 383). Hence, when the plane of this diagonal is at right angles to the plane of polarization of the mirror, the re flected ray will pass through the prism ; but when the two planes mentioned coincide, the planes of vibration are at right angles and the reflected ray is extinguished by the prism. 9 \u2022"], [148, "130 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS.

The objects for which these instruments, as well as the tourmaline plates, are employed, will be found described in the following pages. The Nicol prisms are often used as an appendage to the ordinary com pound microscope, and in this form are important as enabling us to examine very minute crystals in polarized light."], [149, "131 OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF ISOMETRIC CRYSTALS. DISTINGUISHING OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF THE CRYS- TALS OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. It has already been remarked that, all crystallized minerals group them selves into three grand classes, which are distinguished by their physical properties, as well as their geometrical form : A. Isometric, in which the crystals are developed alike in all the several axial directions. B. lot lia metric, including the tetragonal and hexagonal systems, whose crystals are alike in the directions of the several lateral axes, but vertically the development is unlike that laterally. C. Anisometric, embracing the three remaining systems, where the crys tals are developed in the three axial directions dissimilarly-. Between these classes there are many cases of gradual transition in crystalline form, and, similarly and necessarily, in optical character. The line between uniaxial and biaxial crystals, for instance, cannot be considered a very sharply defined one. A. Isometric Crystals. General Optical Character. All isometric crystals are alike in this respect that they simply refract, but do not doubly refract the light they transmit. They are optically isotrope. This follows directly from the symmetry of the crystallization. In the language of Fresnel, the elasticity of the light-ether is throughout them the same, and the light is propagated in every direction with the same velocity. There is, consequently, but, one value of the index of refrac tion. The wave-surface is spherical. This class also includes all trans parent amorphous substances, like glass. Optical Investigation of Isometric Crystals. In consequence of their isotropic character, isometric cry-stals exhibit no special phenomena in polarized light. Sections of isometric crystals may be always recognized as such by the fact that they behave as an amorphous substance in polarized light ; in other words, when the Nicol prisms are crossed they- appear dark, and a revolution of the section in any plane pro duces no change in appearance. Similarly they appear light when placed between parallel Nicols. Some anomalies are mentioned on p. 154. Isometric crystals hare but a single index of refraction, and that may be determined in the way described by means of a prism cut with its edge in any direction whatever. Crystals of the second and third classes are optically anisotrope."], [150, "132 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. B. Uni axial Crystals. General Optical Character. In the isodiametric crystals, those of the tetragonal and hexagonal sys tems, there is crystallographically one axial direction, that of the vertical axis, which is distinguished from the other lateral directions which are amontc themselves alike. So also the optical investigations of these crystals show 'that with reference to the action of light there exists a similar kind of symmetry. Light is propagated in the direction of the vertical axis with a velocity different from that with which it passes in any other direction, but for all directions at right angles to the vertical axis, or all directions making the same angle with it, the velocity of propagation is the same. In other words, the elasticity of the ether in the direction of the vertical axis is either greater or less than that in directions normal to it (analogous to the crystallographical relation c a), while in the latter directions it is everywhere alike. Optic axis. \u2014 Let a ray of light pass through the crystal in the direction of the vertical axis, ah, in f. 386, its vibrations must take pilace iu the plane at right angles to this axis ; but in all directions in this plane the elasticity of the ether is the same, hence for such a ray the crystal must act as an isotrope medium ; and the ray7 is con sequently not doubly- refracted and not polarized. This direction is called the optic axis.* Double refraction. \u2014 If, on the other hand, the ray of light passes through the crystal in any other direction, it is divided into two rays, or doubly refracted (see f. 377), and this in consequence of the difference in the elasticity of the ether in the plane in which the vibra tions take place. Of these two rays, one follows the law of ordinary refraction, and this is called the ordinary ray ; the other does not conform to this law, aud is called the extraordinary ray. Both these rays are polar ized, and in planes at right angles to each other ; the vibrations of the extraordinary ray take place in the plane passing through the incident ray and vertical axis, called the principal section, those of the ordinary ray are in a plane at right angles to this. Wave-surface of the ordinary ray. \u2014 The meaning of the statement that the ordinary7 ray follows the law of the simple refraction is this : \u2014 the index of refraction (o>. of the ordinary ray has invariably7 the same value, what ever be the direction in which the light passes through the crystal ; the amount of deviation from the perpendicular is always in accordance with *-m _ * the law \u2014 \u2014 = n (to). In other words, the ordinary ray- is propagated m all directions in the medium with the same velocity ; and hence the wave- * It will be understood that the optic axis is always a direction, not a fixed line in the crystals."], [151, "optical characters of uniaxial crystals. 133 surface is that of a sphere. Moreover, the ordinary ray always remains in the plane of incidence. Wave-surface of the extraordinary ray. \u2014 For the extraordinary ray the law of simple refraction does not hold good. If experiments be made upon any uniaxial crystal, it will be found that the two rays are most separated when (1) the light falls perpendicular to the vertical axis. As its inclina tion toward the axis is diminished, the extraordinary ray approaches the ordinary ray, and coincides with it when (2) the light passes through par allel to the vertical axis. The index of refraction of the extraordinary ray varies in value, being most unlike a> for the first case supposed when the vibrations of the extraordinary ray are parallel to the axis (when it is called e), and is equal to to for the second case supposed. The velocity of this ray is then variable in a corresponding manner. The wave-surface of the extraordinary ray is an ellipsoid of rotation. Moreover it ordinarily does not remain in the plane of incidence. Two cases are now possible : the index (to) of the ordinary ray may be (1) greater than that of the extraordinary ray (e), in which case the velocity- of the light, in the direction of the vertical axis is less than that in any other direction ; or (2) o> may be less than e, and in this case the velocity of pro pagation for the light has its maximum parallel to the vertical axis. The former are called negative, the latter positive crystals. The fact alluded to here should be noted that the value of the refractive index is inversely proportional to the velocity of the light, or elasticity of the ether, in the given direction. Negative crystals ; Wave-surface. \u2014 For calcite us =1-654, e = 1-483, it is hence one of the class of negative crystals. The former value (<_>) belongs to the ray vibrating at right angles to the vertical axis, and the latter value (e) to the ray with vibrations parallel to the axis. As has been stated, the refractive index for the extraordinary ray increases from 1.483 to 1.654, as the ray becomes more and more nearly parallel to the vertical axis. Fig. 387 ill us- 387 trates graphically the relation between the two indices of refraction, and the correspond ing velocities of the rays ; ab represents the direction of the vertical axis, that is, the optic axis. Also ma, mb represent the velocity of the light parallel to this axis, correspond ing to the greater index of refraction (1-654). The circle described with this radius will represent the constant velocity of the .ordi- nary ray- in any7 direction whatever. Let further mil, me represent the velocity of the extraordinary ray passing at right angles to the axis, hence corresponding to the smaller index of refraction (1-483). The ellipse, whose major and minor axes are ed and ab, will express the law in accordance with which the velocity of the extraordinary ray varies, viz., greatest in the direction md, least in the direction ab in which it coincides with the ordinary ray. For any inter mediate direction, hgm, the velocity will be expressed by the length of the line, hm. Now let this figure be revolved about the axis ab ; there will be generated"], [152, "134 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. a circle within an oblate ellipsoid of rotation (f. 388). The surface of the sphere is the wave-surface of the ordinary ray, 388 and that of the ellipsoid of the extraordinary and that of the ellipsoid of the extraordinary ray ; the line of their intersection is the optic axis. In f. 377, p. 125, the ray of light is shown divided into two by the piece of calcite ; of these, bd, which is the more refracted, is the ordinary ray, and ed, which is less refracted, is the extraordinary ray. Positive crystals ; Wave-surface. \u2014 For quartz <*. = 1*548, e = 1*558. The index of refraction for the ordinary- ray (w) is less than that of the extraordinary ray (e) ; quartz hence belongs to the class of positive crystals. The value of e \u25a0(1*558) for the extraordinary ray- corresponds to the direction of the ray at right angles to the vertical axis, when its vibrations are parallel to this axis. As the direction of the ray changes and becomes more and more nearly par- allel to the axis, the value of its index of re fraction decreases, aud when it is p>arallel to the latter, it has the value 1-548. The extraordin ary ray then coincides with the ordinary, and there is no double refraction; this is, as be fore, the line of the optic axis. The law for both rays can be represented graphically in the same way as for negative crystals. In f. 3S9, amb is the direction of the optic axis; let ma, mb represent the velocity of the ordin ary ray, -which corresponds to the least re fractive index (1*548), the circle afbe will express the law for this ray, viz., the velocity the same in every direction. Moreover, let md, me represent the velocity of the extraor- 389 dinary ray. at right angles to the axis, which corresponds to the maximum refractive index (1-55S) ; the ellipse, adbc, will express the law for velocity of the extraordinary ray, viz , least in the direction md, aud greatest in the direction ab, when it is equal to that of the ordinary ray, and varying uniformly between these limits. If the figure be revolved as before, there will be generated a spihere, whose surface is the wave-surface of the ordin ary ray, and within it a prolate ellipsoid whose surface represents the wave-surface of the extraordinary ray. The following list includes examples of both classes of uniaxial crystals: Negative crystals (\u2014), Calcite, Positive crystals (+), Quartz, Zircon, Hematite, Apophyllite, Cassiterite. Tourmaline, Corundum, Beryl, Apatite. It may be remarked that in some species both -f and \u2014 varieties have"], [153, "135 OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF UNIAXIAL CRYSTALS. been observed. Certain crystals of apophyllite are positive for one end of the spiectrum and negative for the other, and consequently for some color between the two extremes it has no double refraction. These principles make the explanation of the use of tourmaline plates and calcite prisms as polarizing instruments (p. 128) more intelligible. The two rays into which the single ray is divided on passing through a uniaxial crystal are, as has been said, both polarized, the ordinary ray in a plane passing through the vertical axis and the extraordinary ray perpendicular to this. In a tourmaline plate of the proper thickness, cut parallel to the axis <*, the ordinary ray is absorbed (for the most part) and the extraordinary ray alone passes through, having its vibrations in the direction of the vertical axis. In the calcite prism, of the two refracted and polarized rays, the ordinary ray is disposed of artificially in the manner mentioned (p. 129), and the extraordinary ray alone passes through, vibrating as already remarked, in the direction of the axis _, or, in other words, of the shorter diagonal of the Nicol prism . The relation of these phenomena to the molecular structure of the crystal is well shown by the effect of pressure upon a parallelopiped of glass Glass, normally, exhibits no colored phenomena in polarized light, since the elasticity of the ether is the same in all directions. and there is hence no double refraction. But if the block be placed under pressure, exerted on two opposite faces, the conditions are obviously changed, the density is the same in the both lateral directions but differs from that in the direction of the axis of pressure. The sym metry in molecular structure becomes that of a uniaxial crystal, and, as would be expected, on placing the block in the polariscope, a black cross with its colored rings is observed, exactly as with calcite. Similarly when glass has been suddenly and unevenly cooled its molecular structure is not homogeneoas, aud it will be found to polarize light, although the phenomena, for obvious reasons, will not have the regularity of the case described. It may be added here that recent investigations by Mr. John Kerr have shown that electri city calls out birefringent phenomena in a block of glass. (Phil. Mag., 1., 337.) Optical Investigation of Uniaxial Crystals. Sections normal or parallel to the axis in polarized light. \u2014 Suppose a section to be cut perpendicular to the vertical axis (axial section), it has already- been shown that a ray of light passing through the crystal in this direction suffers no change, consequently, such a section examined in parallel polarized light, in the instrument (f. 3S5), appears as a section of an isometric crystal. If the same section be placed in the other instrument (f. 3S4, p. 130), arranged for viewing the object in converging light, or in the tourmaline tongs, a beautiful phenomenon is observed ; a symmetrical black cross \u2014 when the Nicols or tourmaline plates are crossed \u2014 with a series of concentric rings, dark and light, in monochromatic light, but in white light, showing the prismatic colors in succession in each ring. This is shown without the colors in f. 390, the arrangement of the colors in the elliptical rings of the plate opposite page 144 is similar. This cross becomes white when the Nicols or tourmalines are in a par- allel position, and each band of color in white light changes to its comple- mentary tint (f. 391). These interference figures are seen* in this form only in a plate cut perpendicular to the vertical axis, and marks the uni axial character of the crystal. The explanation of this phenomenon can be only hinted at in this place. * Uniaxial crystals which produce circular polarization exhibit interference figures which differ somewhat from those described. Some anomalies are mentioned on p. 154."], [154, "136 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. All the rays of light, whose vibrations coincide with the vibration-planes of either of the crossed Nicols, must necessarily be extinguished. _ This gives rise to the black cross in the centre, with its arms in the direction of the planes mentioned. All other rays passing through the given plate obliquely will be doubly refracted, and after passing through the second Nicol, thus being referred to the same plane of polarization, they will interfere, and will give rise to a series of concentric rings, light and dark in homogeneous light, but in ordinary light showing the successive colors of the spectrum. In regard to the interference of polarized rays, the fact must be stated that that can take place only when they vibrate in the same plane ; two rays vibrating at right angles to each other cannot interfere. These interference phenomena are similar to the successive spectra obtained by diffraction gratings alluded to on p. 125. It is evident that, in order to observe the pihenomena most advantageously, the plate must have a suitable thickness, which, however, varies with the refractive index of the substance. The thicker the plate the smaller the rings and the more they- are crowded together ; when the thickness is considerable, only the black brushes are seen. Section parallel (or sharply inclined) to the axis. \u2014 If a section of a uni axial crystal, cut parallel or inclined to the vertical axis, be examined in parallel pjolarized light, it will, when its axis coincides with the direction of vibration of one of the Nicol prisms, appear dark when the prisms are crossed. If, however, it be revolved horizontally on the stage of the polari scope (I, I , f . 384) it will appear alternately dark and light at intervals of 45\u00b0, dark under the conditions mentioned above, otherwise more or less light, the maximum of light being obtained when the axis of the section makes an angle of 45\u00b0 with the plane of the Nicol. Between parallel Nicols the phenomena are the same except that the light and darkness are reversed. When the pdate is not too thick the polarized ray, after piassing the upper. Nicol, will interfere, and in white light, the plate will show bright colors, which change as one of the Nicols or the plate is revolved. Examined in converging light, similar sections, when very thin, show in white light a series of parallel colored bands. Determination of the indices of refraction to and e.- \u2014 One prism will"], [155, "OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF UNIAXIAL CRYSTALS. 137 suffice for the determination of both indices of refraction, and its edge may be either parallel or perpendicular to the vertical axis. (a) If parallel to the vertical axis, the angle of minimum deviation for each ray in succession must be measured. The extraordinary ray vibrates parallel to, and the ordinary ray at right angles to, the direction of the edge of the prism. For convenience it is better to isolate each of the rays in succession, which is done with a single Nicol prism. If this is held before the observing telescope with its shorter diagonal parallel to the refracting edge of the prism, the ordinary ray will be extinguished and the image of the slit observed will be that due to the extraordinary ray. If held with its plane of vibration at right angles to the prismatic edge, the extraordinary ray will be extinguished and the other alone observed. From the single observed angle, for the given color, the index of refraction can be calculated, tu or e, by the formula given on p. 124, the angle of the prism being known. (b) If the refracting edge of the prism is perpendicular to the vertical axis of the crystal, the same procedure is necessary, only in this case the ordinary ray7 will vibrate parallel to the prismatic edge, and the extraordi nary ray at right angles to it. The two rays are distinguished, as before, by a Nicol prism. Determination of the positive or negative character of the double refrac tion. \u2014 The most obvious way of determining the character of the double refraction (ca > e or to > e) is to measure the indices of refraction in accord ance with the principles explained in the preceding paragraphs. It is not always possible, however, to obtain a prism suitable for this purpose, and in any case it is convenient to have a more simple method of accomplishing the result. To do this, use may be made of a very simple principle : \u2014 the + or \u2014 character of a given crystal is determined by observing the effect produced when an axial section from it is combined in the polariscope with that of a crystal of known character. For instance, calcite is negative, and if it be placed in conjunction with the section of a positive crystal, the whole effect, observed is the same as that which would lie produced if the original plate were diminished in thickness, while, if combined with a negative crystal, it is as if the plate were made thicker. It has already been remarked that, as the axial pilate of a crystal increases in thickness, the number of rings visible in the field of the polari scope increases, and they become more crowded together ; but, if the section is made thinner, the successive rings widen out and become less numerous. One or the other of these effects is produced by the use of the intervening section. In the case of uniaxial crystals, however, the method which is practically most simple is that suggested by Dove \u2014 the use of an axial pilate of mica of a certain thickness. The section required is a cleavage piece of such a thickness that the two rays in passing through suffer a difference of phase which is equal to a quarter wave-length, or an odd multiple of this. Suppose that the section of the crystal to be examined, cut perpendicular to the axis, is brought between the crossed Nicols in the polariscope ; the black cross and the concentric colored rings are of course visible. Let now, while the given section occupies this position, the mica plate be placed upon it, with the plane of its optic axes (determined beforehand, and the direction"], [156, "138 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. marked by- a line for convenience) making an angle of 45\u00b0 with the vibra tion-planes of the Nicols ; the black cross disappears and there remain only two diagonally situated dark spots in the place of it. Moreover, the colored curves in the two quadrants with these spots are pushed farther away from the centre than the others. The effect produced is represented in f. 392 and f. 393. If the line joining these two dark spots stands at right angles to the axial plane of the mica, the crystal is positive (f. 392), if this line coincides with the axial plane, the crystal is negative (f. 393). The explana tion of this effect is not so simple as to allow of being introduced here ; the effect of the mica is to produce circular polarization of the light which it transmits. With both uniaxial and biaxial crystals the student will find it of great assistance always to have at his side a good section of a positive and a negative crystal. By comparing the phenomena observed in the section under examination with those shown by crystals of known character, he will often be saved much perplexity. For the investigation of the absorption phenomena of uniaxial crystals see p. 161. Circular Polarization. In what has been said of polarized light, in the preceding pages, it has been assumed that a polarized ray was one whose vibrations took place in a single plane, so that the plane of polarization at right angles to this was a fixed plane. Such a ray is said to be linearly polarized. There are some uniaxial crystals, however, which have the power to rotate the plane of polari zation ; the ray is said to be circularly polarized. They manifest this in the phenomena observed when an axial section is examined in the polariscope. An axial section of a uniaxial crystal normally exhibits, in converging polarized light, a black cross with a series of concentric colored circles, f. 390, p. 136. If, however, a section of quartz be cut perpendicular to the axis and viewed between the crossed Nicols, the phenomena observed are different from these : \u2014 the central portion of the black cross has disap geared, and instead, the space within the inner ring is brilliantly colored. urthermore, when the analyzing Nicol is revolved, this color changes from blue to yellow to red, and it is found that in some cases this"], [157, "139 CIRCULAR POLARIZATION. change is produced by revolving the Nicol to the right, and in other cases to the left. To distinguish between these the first are called right-handed rotating crystals, and the others left-handed. The relations here involved will be better understood if the quartz section is viewed in parallel mono chromatic light. Under these circumstances a similar plate of calcite appears dark when the Nicols are crossed, but with quartz the maximum darkness is only obtained when the analyzer has been revolved beyond its first position a certain angle ; this angle increasing with the thickness of the section, and also varying with the color of the light employed. For a section 1 mm. thick in red light, a rotation of the analyzer of 19\u00b0 is required to produce the maximum darkness. For yellow light the rotation is 24\u00b0 with a plate of the same thickness ; with blue, 32\u00b0, and so on. The rotation of the analyzer with some crystals is to the right, with others to the left. The explanation of these facts lies in the fact stated above, that the quartz rotates the plane of vibration of the polarized light, and the angle of rotation is different for rays of different wave-lengths. Furthermore, this rotation of the plane of vibration results from the fact that in quartz, even in the direction of its axis, double refraction takes place. The oscillations of the particles of ether take place not in straight lines but in circles, and they move in opposite directions for the two rays, ordinary and extraor- dinary. An axial section of a quartz crystal can never appear dark between crossed Nicols in ordinary light, since there is no point at which all the colors are extinguished ; on the contrary, it appears highly colored. The color depends upon the thickness of the section, and is the same as that observed in the centres of the rings in converging polarized light. If sec- tions of a right-handed and left-handed crystal are placed together in the polariscope, the centre of the interference figure is occupied with a four- rayed spiral curve, called from the discoverer Airy's spiral. Twins of quartz crystals are not uncommon, consisting of the combination of right- and left-handed individual, which sometimes show the spirals of Airy. It is a remarkable fact, discovered by Herschel, that the right- or left handed optical character of quartz is often indicated by the position of the trapezohedral planes on the crystals. When a given trapezohedral plane appears as a modification of the prism, to the right above and left below, the crystal is optically right-handed ; if to the left above and right below, the crystal is left-handed,. In f. 394 the plane is, as last remarked, left above and right below, and the crystal is hence left-handed. Cinnabar has been shown by Des Cloizeaux to possess the same property as quartz; aud this is true also of some artificial salts, also solutions of sugar, etc. In twins of quartz, the component parts may be both right-handed or both left-handed (as in those of Dauphiny and the Swiss Alps) ; or one may7 be of one kind and the other of the other. Moreover, successive layers of deposition (made as the crystal went on enlarging, and often exceedingly thin) are sometimes alternately right- and left-handed, showing a constant oscillation of polarity in the course of its formation ; and, when this is the case, and the layers are regular, cross-sections, examined by polarized light, exhibit a division, more or less perfect, into sectors of 120\u00b0, parallel to the plane R, or into sectors of 60\u00b0. If the layers are of unequal thickness,"], [158, "140 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. there are broad areas of colors without sectors. In f . 395 (by Des Cloizeaux, from a crystal from the Dept. of the Aude), half of each sector of 60\u00b0 is 395 right-handed, and the other half left (as shown by the arrows), and the dark radii are neutral bands produced by the overlapping of layers of the two kinds. These overlapping portions often exhibit the phenomenon of Airy's spiral. C. Biaxial Crystals, General Optical Character. As in the crystalline systems, thus far considered, so also in the anisome trie systems, the orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic, there is a strict corre spondence between the molecular structure, as exhibited in the geometrical form of the crystals, and their optical properties. In the crystals of these systems there is no longer one axis around about which the elasticity of the light-ether, that is, the velocity of the light, is everywhere alike. On the contrary, the relations are much less simple, and less easy to comprehend. There are two directions in which the light passes through the crystal without double refraction \u2014 these are called the optic axes, and hence the crystals are biaxial \u2014 but in every other direction a ray of light is separated into two rays, polarized at right angles to 396 each other. Neither of these conforms to the law of simple refraction. The subject was first developed theoretically by Fresnel, and his conclusions have since been fully verified by experiment. Axes of elasticity. \u2014 In regard to the elasticity of the ether in a biaxial crystal there are (1) a maximum vaiue, (2) a minimum value, and (3) a mean value, and these values in the crystal are found in \u2022, iiiese \\ aiues in uie -oi^ \u00bb*.<\u2022*,_ <uc _a.i__.iv* \u00bb-\u2022 directions at right angles to each other. In f. 396, CC represents the axis (c) of least elasticity, AA' of greatest elasticity (a), and BB' of mean elasticity (b). A ray passing in the direc-"], [159, "141 OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF BIAXIAL CRYSTALS. tion CC vibrates in a plane at right angles, that is, parallel to BB' and A A '. Similarly for the ray BB' the vibrations are parallel to AA' and CC, and for the ray AA' parallel to BB' and CC. Between these extreme values of the axes of elasticity, the elasticity varies according to a regular law, as will be seen in the following discussion. The form of the wave-surface for a biaxial crystal may be determined by fixing its form for the planes of the axes o, b, and t. Wave-surface. \u2014 First consider the case of rays in the plane of the axes BB' and CC (f. 397). A ray pass ing in the direction CC is separated into two sets of vibrations, one paral lel to AA', corresponding to the greatest elasticity, moving more rapidly than the other set, parallel to BB', which correspond to the mean elasticity. The velocity of the two sets of vibrations are made pro portional to the lengths of the lines mn, and mo respectively, in f. 397. Again, for a ray in the same plane, parallel to BB', the vibrations are (1) parallel to AA' , and propagated faster (greatest elasticity) than the other set ; (2) parallel to CC (least elasticity). Again, in f. 397, on the line CC, mn\" , and mq\" are made proportional to these two velocities; here mn = mn\", and for a ray in the 397 same plane in any other direction, there will be one set of vibrations parallel to AA', with the same velocity as before, and another set at right angles with a velocity between mo and mq\" , determined by the ellipse whose semi-axes are proportional to the mean and greatest axes of elasticity. Fig. 397 then represents the section of the wave-surface through the axes CC and BB'. The circle nn\" shows the constant velocity for all vibrations par allel to AA', and the ellipse the variable values of the velocity for the other set of vibrations at right angles to the first. Again, for a ray in the plane AA', BB , the method of the construction is similar. The vibrations will in every case take place in the plane at right angles to the direction of the ray, which plane must always pass through the axis CC of least elasticity. Hence for every direction of the ray in the plane men tioned, one set of vibrations will always be parallel to CC, and hence be propagated with a constant velocity"], [160, "142 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. (= mo', f. 398), and hence this is expressed by the circle oo'. The other set of vibrations will be at right angles to CC, and the velocity with which they are propagated will vary according as they are parallel to AA' (= mn, f. 398), or parallel to BB' (= mq'), or some intermediate value for an intermediate position. The section of the wave-surface is consequently a circle within an ellipse. Finallv,lettheraypassin some direction in the plane CC ,AA , of least and greatest elasticity, the section of the wave-surface is also a circle and ellipse. & \u2022\" a a\\ \u201e\u00bb. ..\u201e. o._, ;\u2122 .i,\u201e ,..\u201e_,_..,\u2022._\u201e Suppose the ray7 passes in the direction parallel to AA', the vibrations will be (1) parallel to CC, and (2) parallel to BB', those (1) parallel to CC\" (least axis of elasticity) are propagated more slowly than those (2) parallel to BB' (axis of mean elasticity). In f. 399, on the line AA', lay off mo' and mq' proportional to these two values. Again, for a ray parallel to CC the vibrations will take place (1) parallel to AA' , and (2) parallel to BB', the former will be propagated with greater velocity than those latter. These two values of the velocity in the direction CC\" are represented by mn'' and mq\" (\u2014 mq'). For any intermediate position of the ray in the same plane there will always be one set of vibrations parallel to BB (mq' \u2014 mq\", f. 399, hence the circle). The other set at right angles to these will be propagated with a velocity va rying according to the direction, from that correspjonding to the least axis of elasticity (represented by mo', f . 399), to that of the greatest axis of elasticity (mn\"). Optic axes. \u2014 It is seen that the cir cle, representing the uniform velocity of vibrations pjarallel to b, and the ellipse repiresenting the varying value of the velocity for the vibrations at right angles to these, intersect one an other at\" P, P', f. 399. The obvious meaning of this fact is that, for the directions mP, and mP', making equal angles with the axis CC, the velocity- is the same for both sets of vibrations ; these are not separated from each other, the ray is not doubly refracted, and not polarized. These two directions are called the optic axes. All anisometric crystals have, as has been stated, two optic axes, and are hence called biaxial."], [161, "OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF BIAXIAL CRYSTALS. 143 The complete wave-surface of a biaxial crystal is constructed from the three sections given in f. 397, 398, 399. It is shown graphically in f. 400, where the lines PP, and P'P' are the two optic axes. Bisectrices, or Mean-lines. \u2014 As shown in f. 399, the optic axes always lie in the plane of greatest (a) and least (c) elasticity, and the value of the optic axial angle is known when the axes of elasticity are given as stated below. The axis of elasticity which, as the line CC\", f. 399, bisects the acute angle is called the acute bisectrix, or first mean-line (erste Mittellinie, Germs), and that bisecting the obtuse angle, the obtuse bisectrix, or second mean-line (zweite Mittellinie, Germs). Positive and negative crystals. \u2014 When the acute bisectrix is the axis of least elasticity (c), it is said to be positive, and when it is the axis of greatest (a) elasticity, it is said to be negative. Barite is positive, mica negative. Indices of refraction. \u2014 It has been seen that in uniaxial crystals there are two extreme values for the velocity with which light is propagated, and corresponding to them, and inversely proportional to them, tivo indices of refraction. Similarly for biaxial crystals, where there are three axes of elasti city, there are three indices of refraction \u2014 a maximum index a, a minimum 7, and a mean value /3 ; a is the index for the rays propagated at right angles to a, but vibrating parallel to a ; /3 is the index for rays propagated perpen dicularly to b, by vibrations parallel to b ; 7 is the index for rays propagated perpendicularly to c, but vibrating parallel to c- a- = \u2014 , ft = \u2014 , 7 = \u2014 . a b t If a, /3, and 7 are known, the value of the optic axial angle (2 V) can be calculated from them by the following formula : V a2 t3 Dispersion of the optic axes. \u2014 It is obvious that the three indices of refraction may have different values for the different colors, and as the angle of the optic axes, as explained in the last paragraph, is determined by these three values, the axial angle will also vary in a corresponding manner. This variation in the value of the axial angle for rays of different wave lengths is called the dispersion of the axes, and the two possible cases are distinguished by writing p > v when the angle for the red rays (p) is greater than for the blue (violet, v), and p < v when the reverse is true. In the properties thus far mentioned, the three systems are alike ; in details, however, they differ widely. Practical Investigation of Biaxial Crystals. Interference figures. \u2014 A section cut perpendicular to either axis will show, in converging polarized light, a system of concentric rays analogous to those of uniaxial crystals, f. 390, but more or less elliptical. There is, moreover, no black cross, but a single black line, which changes its position as the Nicols are revolved."], [162, "144 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. If a section of a biaxial crystal, cut perpendicularly to the first, that is acute, bisectrix, is viewed in the polariscope, a different phenomenon is observed. There are seen in this case, supposing the plane of the axes to make an angle of 45\u00b0 with the planes of polarization of the crossed Nicols, two black hyper bolas, marking the position of the axes, a series of elliptical curves surround ing the two centres and finally uniting, forming a series of lemniscates. If monochromatic light is employed, the rings are alternately light and dark ; if white light, each ring shows the successive colors of the spectrum. If one of the Nicol prisms be revolved, the dark hyperbolic brushes gradu ally become white, and the colors of the rings take the complementary tints after a revolution of 90\u00b0. Since the black hyperbolic brushes mark the position of the optic axes, the smaller the axial angle the nearer together are the hyperbolas, and when the angle is very small, the axial figure observed closely resembles the simple cross of a uniaxial crystal. On the other hand, when the axial angle is large the hyperbolas are far apart, and may even be so far apart as to be invisible in the field of the polariscope. When the plane of the axes coincides with the pflane of vibration for either Nicol, these being crossed, an unsymmetrical black cross is observed, and also a series of elliptical curves. Both these figures are well exhibited on the pilate opposite this p>age ; the one gradually changes into the other as the crystal-section is revolved in the horizontal plane, the Nicols remaining stationary. A section of a biaxial crystal cut perpendicular to the obtuse bisectrix will exhibit the same figures under the same conditions in pjolarized light, when the angle is not too large. This is, however, generally the case, and in consequence the axes suffer total reflection on the inner surface of the section, and no axial figures are visible. This is sometimes the case also"], [163, "145 OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF BIAXIAL CRYSTALS. with a section cut normal to the acute bisectrix, when the angle is large. A micrometer scale in the polariscope, f. 3S4, allows of an approximate measurement of the axial angle ; the value of each division of the scale being known. Measurement of the axial angle. \u2014 The determination of the angle made by the optic axes is of the highest importance, and the method of proce dure offers no great difficulties. Fig. 401 shows the instrument recom mended for this purpose by DesCloizeaux ; its general features will be understood without detailed description ; some improvements have been introduced by Groth, which make the instrument more accurate and con venient of use. The section of the crystal, cut at right angles to the bisec trix, is held in the pincers at c, with the plane of the axes horizontal, making an angle of 45\u00b0 with the plane of vibration of the Nicols (XN). There is a cross- wire in the focus of the eye-piece, and as the pincers hold ing the section are turned by the screw F, one of the axes, that is one black hyperbola, is brought in coincidence with the vertical cross-wire, and then, by a further revolution of F, the second. The angle which the section has been turned from one axis to the second, as read off at the vernier H on the graduated circle above, is the apparent angle for the axes of the given crystal as seen in the air (aca, f. 402). ft is only the ajyparent angle, for, owing to the refraction suffered on passing from the section of the crystal to the air, the true axial angle is more 01 less increased, according to the refractive index of the given crystal. This being understood, the fact already stated is readily intelligible, that when the axial angle exceeds a certain limit, the axes will suffer total reflection (p. 124), and they will be no longer visible at all. When this is the case, oil* or some other medium with high refractive power is made use of, into which the axes pass when no longer visible in the air. In the instrument described a small receptacle holding the oil is brought between the tubes, as seen in the figure, and the pincers holding the section are immersed in this, and the angle measured as before. In the majority of cases it is only the acute axial angle that it is practi cable to measure ; but sometimes, especially when oil is made use of, the obtuse angle can also be determined from a second section normal to the obtuse bisectrix. If E = the apparent semi-axial angle in air (f. 402). j Ha = the apparent semi-acute angle in oil. ( H0 = \" \u2022' \" obtuse \" \" \" Va. \u2014 the real (or interior) semi-acute angle (f. 402).

These formulas give the true interior angle from the measured apparent angle when the mean refractive index (/3) is known. If, however, it is possible to measure both the acute and obtuse apparent angles, the true angle, and also the value of /_?, can be determined from them. For sin V0 = cos Va, hence : sm IIa _ sm IIa sin H0 sin Va tan T a = \u2014. \u2014 tt '\u25a0> P \u2014 n W \u2014 n W = ~ \u2014 v~ \u25a0 sin H0 sm ]a cos 1, sin Ii, In measuring this angle, if white light is employed, the colors being separated, the position of the hyperbolas is a little uncertain ; hence it is always important to measure the angle for monochromatic light, red and yellow and blue particularly. This is especially essential where-the disper sion of the axes is considerable. Determination of the indices of refraction. \u2014 The values of the three indices of refraction, a, fi, 7, for biaxial crystals, may be determined from three prisms cut with their refracting edges parallel respectively to the three axes of elasticity a, b, and c. In each case, after the angle of the prism has been measured, the angle of minimum deviation must be meas ured for that one of the two refracted rays whose vibrations are parallel to the edge of the prism ; the formula of p. 124 is then employed. It is possible, however, to obtain the values of a, /_?, and 7 with two prisms ; in this case one of the prisms must be so made that its vertical edge is parallel to one axis of elasticity, while the line bisecting its refracting angle at this edge is parallel to a second. In the case of such a prism the minimum deviation of the ray is obtained for both rays, that having its vibrations parallel to the prism-edge, and that vibrating at right angles to this, that is parallel to the bisector of the prismatic angle. Of the three indices of refraction, /3 is one which it is most important to determine, since by means of it, in accordance with the above formulas, the true value of the axial angle can be calculated from its apparent value in air. The prism to give the value of /3 should obviously have its refract ing edge parallel to the mean axis of elasticity b, that is at right angles to the plane of the optic axes. Determination of the positive or negative character of biaxial crystals. \u2014 The question of the positive or negative character of a biaxial crystal is determined from the values of the indices of refraction, where these can be obtained. If r, the axis of least elasticity, is the acute bisectrix, the crystal is optically positive ; if a, the axis of greatest elasticity, is the acute bisec trix, the crystal is optically negative ; in the former case the value of b is nearer that of c than of a, in the second case the reverse of this is true. There is, however, a more simple method of solving the problem, as was remarked also in regard to uniaxial crystals. The methods are similar. The quarter-undulation mica plate may be employed just as with uniaxial crystals, but its use is not very satisfactory excepting when the axial diver gence is quite small. In this case it can be employed to advantage, the"], [165, "DISTINGUISHING OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF ORTHORHOMBIC CRYSTALS. 147 plane of the axes of the crystal investigated being made to coincide with the vibration-plane of one of the Nicols. The more general' method is the employment of a wedge-shaped piece of quartz ; this is so cut that one sur face coincides with the direction of the vertical axis, and the other makes an angle of 4\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 with it. By this means a section of varying thickness is obtained. The section to be examined normal to the acute bisectrix is brought between the crossed Nicols of the polariscope (f. 384), and with its axial plane making an angle of 45\u00b0 with the polarization-plane of the Nicol prisms ; that is, so that the black hyperbolas are visible. The quartz wedge is now introduced slowly between the section examined and the analyzer; in the instrument figured a slit above gives an opportunity- to insert it. The quartz section is introduced first, in a direction at right angles to the axial plane, that is, to the line joining the hyperbolas, of the plate investigated ; and second, parallel to the axial plane, that is, in the direction of the line joining the hyperbolas. In one direction or the other it will be seen, when the proper thickness of the quartz wedge is reached, that the central rings appear to increase in diameter, at the same time advancing from the centre to the extremities. The effect, in other words, is that which would have been produced by the thinning of the given section. If the phenomenon is observed in the first case when the axis of the quartz is j. arallel to the axial plane, that is to the obtuse bisectrix, it shows that this bisectrix must have an opposite sign to the quartz, that is, the obtuse bisectrix is negative, and the acute bisectrix positive. If the mentioned change in the interference figures takes place when the axis of the quartz is at right angles to the axial plane, then obviously7 the opposite.must be true and the acute bisectrix is negative. The same effect may7 be obtained by bringing an ordinary quartz section of greater or less thickness, cut normal to the axis, between the analyzer and the crystal examined, and then inclining it, first in the direction of the axial plane, and again at right angles to it. The method of investigation with the quartz wedge can be applied even in those cases where the axial angle is too large to appear in the air. For the investigation of the absorption phenomena of biaxial cry-stals, see p. 161. Distinguishing Optical Characters of Orthorhombic Crystals. In the Orthorhombic System, in accordance with the symmetry of the crystallization, the three axes of elasticity coincide with the three crystallo graphic axes. Further than this, there is no immediate relation between the two sets of axes in respect to magnitude, for the reason that, as has been stated, the choice of the crystallographic axes is arbitrary7, and has been made, in most cases, without refereuce to the optical character. Schrauf has proposed that the crystallographic vertical axis (c) should be always made to coincide with the acute bisectrix, which would be very desirable, especially, as urged by him, in showing the true relations between the orthorhombic and hexagonal systems. Of course, this suggestion can be carried out only in those spiecies in which the optical character is known. Schrauf (Phys. Min., p. 302, 303) has shown there is a close analogy between certain"], [166, "148 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. orthorhombic crystals whose prismatic angle is near 120\u00b0 (compare remarks on twins, p, 96) and the crystals of the hexagonal system. With these the acute bisectrix is uniformly parallel to the prismatic edge, and normal to the six-sided basal plane, analogous to the one optic axis of true hexagonal forms. Moreover, he shows that the nearer the prismatic angle approaches 1 20\u00b0, the less the difference between the three axes of elasticity, and the nearer the approach to the uniaxial character. By the combination of thin plates of a biaxial mica optical phenomena may, under some conditions, be observed in polarized light which are similar to those shown by uniaxial crys tals. Similarly twins of chrysoberyl (p. 97) have been described which in spots gave the axial image of uniaxial crystals. This subject has been investigated by Eeusch (Pogg. cxxxvi., 626, 637, 1869), and later by Cooke (Am. Acad. Sci., Boston, p, 35, 1874). Practical Optical Investigation of Orthorhombic Crystals. Determination of the plane of the optic axes. \u2014 The position of the three axes of elasticity in an orthorhombic crystal is always known, since the}' must coincide with the crystallographic axes ; but the plane of the optic axes, that is, of the axes of greatest (a) and least (c) elasticity, must in each case be determined. This plane will be parallel to one of the three diame tral or pinacoid planes. In order to determine in which the axes lie, it is necessary to cut sections parallel to these three directions ; one of these three sections will in all ordinary cases show, in converging polarized light, the interference figures peculiar to biaxial crystals. It is evident, too, that two of the three sections named determine the character of the third, so that the plane of the optic axes and the position of the acute bisectrix can be in practice generally told from them. Measurement of the axial angle, p \"5. v. \u2014 From the section showing the axial figures, that is, normal to the acute bisectrix, the axial angle can be measured in the manner which has been described (p. 145). If it is prac ticable to determine also the obtuse axial angle, from a second section nor mal to the obtuse bisectrix, it will be possible to calculate the true axial angle from these data, and also the mean index of refraction (B). There is further to be determined the dispersion of the axes. Whether the axial angle for red rays is greater or less than for bine (p > v, or p < v) can be seen immediately from the figure of the axes, as in f. la, lb, in the colored plate, p. 144. It is obviously true in this case, from f . la, as also f. lb, that the angle for the blue rays is greater than that for the red (p < \u2022*_\u2022), and so in general. This same point is also accurately determined, of course, by the measured angle for the two monochromatic colors. In all cases the same line will be the bisectrix of the axial angle for both blue and red rays, so that the position of the respective axes is symmetrical with refer ence to the bisectrix. In f. 403, the dis- persion of the axes is illustrated, where p < v ; it is shown also that the lines, B1 B1 and B2 B2, bisect the angles of both red (pOp) and blue (vOv') rays. It also needs no further explanation that fora certain relation"], [167, "DISTINGUISHING OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF MONOCLINIC CRYSTALS. 149 of the refractive indices of the different colors, the acute bisectrix of the axial angle for red rays may be the obtuse bisectrix for the angle for blue rays. Indices of refraction, etc. \u2014 The determination of the indices of refrac tion and the character (+ or \u2014 ) of the acute bisectrix is made for ortho rhombic crystals in the same way as for all biaxial crystals (p. 146). It is merely to be mentioned that, since the axes of elasticity always coincide with the crystallographic axes, it will happen not infrequently that crystals without artificial preparation will furnish, in their prismatic or dome series, prisms whose edges are parallel to the axes of elasticity7, and consequently at once suitable for the determination of the indices of refraction. Distinguishing Optical Characters of Monoclinic Crystals. Position of the axes of elasticity. \u2014 In crystals belonging to the mono clinic system one of the axes of elasticity always coincides with the ortho diagonal axis b, and the other two lie in the plane of symmetry at right angles to this axis. Here obviously three cases are possible, according to which two of the axes, a, b, or c, lie in the plane of symmetry. Corresponding to these three positions of the axes of elasticity, there may occur tiiree kinds of dispersion of these axes, or dispersion of the bisectrices. This dispersion arises from the fact that, while the position of one axis of elasticity is ahvays fixed, the position of the other two is indeterminate and for the same crystal may be different for the different colors, so that the bisectrices of the different colors may not coincide. Dispersion of the bisectrices. \u2014 1. The bisectrices, that is, the axes of greatest and least elasticity, lie in the plane of sym- nietry, while the orthodiagonal axis b coincides with b. The optic axes here suffer a dispersion in this plane of symmetry, and, as already stated, they do not lie symmetrically with reference to the acute bisectrix. This is illustrated in f. 404, where MM is the bisec trix for the angle, vOv', and BB for the angle pOp'. This kind of dispersion is called by DesCloizeaux inclined, (dispersion inclinee). 2. The second case is that where the plane of the optic axes is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry, and the acute bisectrix stands at right angles to the orthodiagonal axis b. In other words, the acute bisectrix and the axis of mean elasticity both lie in the plane of symmetry. In this case also dispersion of the axes may take place, and in this way \u2014 the plane of the optic axes for all the colors lies parallel to the orthodiagonal, but these planes may have different inclinations to the. vertical axis. This is called horizontal dispersion by DesCloizeaux. 3. Still again, in the third place, the plane of the optic axes lies perpen dicular to the plane of symmetry ; but in this case the acute bisectrix is parallel to the crystallographic axis b, so that the obtuse bisectrix and axis of mean elasticity lie in the plane of symmetry. The dispersion which"], [168, "150 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. results in this case is called by DesCloizeaux crossed (dispersion tournante, or croisee). Dispersion as shown in the interference figures. \u2014 If an axial section of a monoclinic crystal be examined in converging polarized light, the kind of dispersion which characterizes it will be indicated by the nature of the interference figures observed ; the three cases are illustrated by the figures upon the accompanying plate, taken from DesCloizeaux (p 144). Figs, la, lb represent the interference figures for an orthorhombic crystal (nitre), characterized by the symmetry in the size of the rings, and the distribution of the colors. Figs. 2a, 2b (diopside), 3\u0153, 3b (orthoclase), 4a, lb (borax), are examples of the corresponding figures for monoclinic crystals, characterized as such more or less distinctly by the want of symmetry in the size of the rings about the two axes, and the irregularity in the arrange ment of the colors. (1) Inclined dispersion. \u2014 \"Where the axes are not symmetrically situated with reference to the acute bisectrix. The relation of the two axial figures is illustrated by f. 405. In f. 2a, 2b this kind of dispersion is indicated by the position of the red and blue at the centres of the rings, and on the borders of the hyperbolas, compare f. la, lb of the normal figure, where there is no dispersion of the bisectrices. (2) Horizontal dispersion, where the planes of the optic axes for the different colors make different angles with the axis. \u2014 This is illustrated by f. 406. The effect upon the interference figures is seen in f. 3a, 3b of the plate, by- comparing the colors within the rings (f. 3a), and on the borders of the hyperbolas (f. 3b), with f. la, lb. (3) Crossed dispersion, where the acute bisectrix coincides with the crystallographic axis b. \u2014 This is illustrated in f. 407, and the interference figures belonging to this kind of dispersion are seen in f. la, \\b of the plate, compared as before with la, lb, and with the other figures. Practical Optical Investigation of Monoclinic Crystals. Determination of the position of the axes of elasticity, that is, the direc tions of vibration. Stauroscope. \u2014 The position of one axis of elasticity is alone known, since, as has been stated, it coincides with the crystallographic axis b. In order to determine the position of the other axes in the plane of symmetry, where they necessarily7 lie, use is made of an instrument, first proposed by von Kobell, called the Stauroscope. The pirinciple of this instrument is very simpde. Supipose that the two Nicols in the polari scope (f. 3S5) have their planes of polarization crossed, causing the maxi mum extinction of light. Now, if a section of any biaxial crystal is brought"], [169, "151 DISTINGUISHING OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF MONOCLLNIC CRYSTALS. between them, obviously, if the position of its two rectangular axes of elasticity, which are its two directions of vibration, coincide with those of the two Nicols, it will produce no change in appearance ; the field of the polariscope, which was dark before, remains dark. But suppose, on the other hand, that it is placed in any- other position in the plane, so that its two rectangular directions of vibration do not coincide with those of the Nicols, the field is no longer dark, but more or less light. The reason for this is, that the light from the lower Nicol meeting the crystal plate is separated, according to the law of the parallelogram of forces, into two sets of vibrations, which are again resolved by the analyzing Nicol, and only one set extinguished by it. If, however, the plate be gradually changed in posi tion, that is, revolved horizontally, until its vibration-directions (axes of elasticity) coincide with those of the Nicols, then, as at first, the light is ex tinguished. If the angle is measured which it is necessary to revolve the section to accomplish the result just remarked, that will be the angle be tween the direction of one of the axes of elasticity of the plate in its original position and the vibration-plane of the Nicol. In figure 40S, let the two larger rectangular arrows represent the vibration directions for the two Nicols, and between the two prisms suppose a section of a monoclinic crystal, 408 abed, to be placed so that one edge of a known crys tallographic plane (eg., i-i) coincides with one of these lines. The field of the microscope, dark before, since the prisms were crossed, is no longer so, and becomes dark again, as explained, only when the crystal is revolved so that its vibration-directions (the smaller dotted arrows) coincide with those of the Nicols, which is indicated by the maximum extinction of the light. The crystal has then the position a'b'c'd'. The angle (f. 40S), which it has been necessary to revolve the plate to obtain the effect described, is the angle which one of the axes of elasticity- in the given plate makes with the given crystallographic edge i-i. The preceding explanations cover everything that is essential in the Stauroscope; but a variety of improvements have been introduced, which practically make the measurements by means of the instrument much more easy and accurate. It will lie seen that the most important feature is the point where the maximum extinction of the light occurs ; this, however, is not easy for the eye to decide upon, and if the trial is made, it will be found that the change produced by a revolution of several degrees is hardly perceptible. To overcome this difficulty, von Kobell propiosed to introduce a section of cal cite just below the analyzer, because its interference figure gives a better opportunity to judge of a change in the intensity- of the light. A still better plan is to introduce a composition plate of calcite, as proposed by Brezina, giving a peculiar interference figure, a very slight change in which destroys its symmetry, and it takes its normal form only when the planes of polariza tion of the two Nicols are exactly at right angles. Supposing this to be the case, when the crystal has been introduced the interference figure is disturbed, it returns to its normal appearance only when the crystal has been revolved"], [170, "152 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. to the point where the vibration-directions of the Nicols and crystal section exactly coincide. It will be observed again, that it is essential that the direction of the known edge of the crystal should be exactly parallel to the vibration-direc tion of one of the Nicols. This condition, in the case of small crystals especially, is hard to fulfil, and to accomplish it most satisfactorily Groth has proposed to use the plate shown in f. 409. The plate of glass, v, held in its present position by the spring, has one edge polished, which adjoins u, and the direction 409 of this is made to coincide exactly with the line joining the opposite zero points of the gradua tion. The crystal section is attached to this plate over the hole seen in v, and with a plane of known crystallographic position, either O, i-i or a plane in that zone or a corresponding edge, coinciding with the direction of the polished edge of the plate. Whether this coincidence is exact can be tested by the reflective goniometer. In order to eliminate any small error, Groth pro poses to measure the divergence from the exact coincidence, and then to make a corresponding correction, for which he furnishes a series of tables. After the adjustment of the crystal section on the plate, the latter is inserted in its place, the whole plate, I, k, occupying the position indicated in f. 385, and the Nicols so adjusted that the plane of vibration of one coincides with the line 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. The angle of revolution of the plate, ., is obtained from the graduated scale on k. It is not always easy7 to make the adjustment of the Nicols alluded to, but the error arising when the vibration-plane of the Nicol does not coincide with the line 0\u00b0 to 1S0\u00b0 is easily eliminated. This is accomplished by remov ing the plate v, and, without disturbing the crystal section, restoring it to its place in an inverted position. The measured angle, if before too great, will now be as much too small, and the arithmetical mean of the two measurements will be the true angle. Reference further may be made to Groth, Fogg. Ann., exliv., 34, 1871. Determination of the plane of the optic axes. \u2014 The investigation of a section of a monoclinic crystal parallel to the pdane of symmetry determines the position of the two remaining axes of elasticity, but it does not fix the relative, position of the greatest and least axes of elasticity7, that is, the plane of the optic axes. To solve the latter point, sections normal to each of the three axes must be examined in converging polarized light, and one of them will show the characteristic interference figures. The section parallel to the plane of symmetry is first to be examined, aud if it does not show the axes even in oil, one or both of the other sections spoken of must be employed. Axial angle, dispersion, etc. \u2014 The method of measuring the axial angle has been already explained, and if this is determined for the different colors it will determine the disp.ersion of the axes p \"% v. The dispersion of the axes of elasticity has been shown to be always indicated by the character of interference figures ; its amount, where con-"], [171, "153 EFFECT OF HEAT UPON THE OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF CRYSTALS. siderable, may be determined by making the stauroscopic measurements for different colors. The remaining points to be investigated, the indices of refraction, and the + or \u2014 character of the crystal, need no further explanation beyond that which has been given, pp. 146, 147. Distinguishing Optical Characters of Triclinic Crystals. The crystals of the triclinic system are characterized by their entire want of crystallographic symmetry, the position and inclination of the axes being entirely arbitrary, and it follows from this that there is no necessary connec tion between them and the rectangular axes of elasticity. More than one of the three kinds of disp.ersion mentioned on p. 150 may occur in a single crystal, and the interference figures will indicate the existence of both. The practical investigation of triclinic crystals optically involves great difficulty ; in general a series of successive trials are required to determine the position of the axes of elasticity. When these are found, the axial sec tions can be prepared and the axial angle determined, and the other points settled as with other biaxial crystals. Effect of Heat upon the Optical Characters of Crvstals. In addition to the ordinary investigation of crystal-sections in the polari- scope, it is often important to determine the influence of heat upon the op.tieal character of crystals. The axial angle may be measured at any required temperature by the use of a metal air-bath. This is placed at V, (f. 401), and extends beyond the instrument on either side, so as to allow of its being heated with gas burners ; a thermometer inserted in the bath makes it possible to regulate the temperature as may be desired. This bath has two openings, closed with glass plates, corresponding to the two tubes carrying the lenses, and the crystal-section, held as usual in the pincers, is seen through these glass windows. The conclusions of DesCloizeaux (see Literature) as to the influence of heat upon the optical characters of crystals are as follows : (1) Uniaxial crystals appear to be uninfluenced by a heating of from 10\u00b0 to 190\u00b0 C. (2) Biaxial crystals of the orthorhombic system suffer a greater or less change in axial angle. (3) Biaxial crystals of the monoclinic system suffer a change in axial angle, and in addition also in the plane of the axes when it is not the plane of symmetry. Triclinic crystals also show a little change in the position of the axes. A striking example of the change in axial divergence is furnished by gypsum. At ordinary7 temperatures the axes lie in the plane of symmetry (i-i) ; at 80\u00b0 C. they unite in a line making an angle of 37\u00b0 28' with a normal to O ; and with an increased temperature they again separate in a plane perpendicular to i-i. DesCloizeaux found that the feldspars, when heated up to a certain point, suffer a change in the position of the axes, and if the heat becomes greater and is long continued, they do not return again to their original position, but remain altered. Weiss* has made use of this principle * Zur Kenntniss der Feldspathbildung ; Haarlem Soc. Verhandl., xxv., 1866."], [172, "154 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. to determine at what temperature certain feldspatbic rocks were formed. This constant change of axial angle upon heating is true also of brookite, zoisite, and other minerals. The investigations of Ffaff show that the opti cal properties of some uniaxial crystals also are affected by heating, though to no great extent. Pogg., cxxiii., 179, cxxiv., 448, etc. Anomalies Exhibited by some Crystals in their Optical Phenomena. There are a considerable number of crystals of the three classes, which, from a variety- of causes, exhibit irregularities in their optical characters; some of the more important cases are mentioned here. Isometric crystals. \u2014 Boracite, and also senarmontite, sometimes exhibit interference figures resembling closely those of biaxial crystals. In the case of boracite this is explained by7 DesCloizeaux as due to the presence of enclosed crystals of parasite formed by alteration. Perofskite is also strongly doubly refracting, and in polarized light appears to be biaxial, although, as shown by Kokscharow, it is isometric in crystallographic rela tions. The irregularities are supposed by him to be caused by the want of homogeneity in the internal structure of the crystals. The properties of double refraction possessed by some substances, crystal lized and non-crystallized, which are normally7 isotrope, are explained by Biot* to be due to lamellar polarization. This is analogous to the produc tion of j. olarized light by means of a series of thin plates (see p. 128). Alum crystals have often the lamellar structure, which causes these pheno mena. . Analcite and leucite have been included in the list of isometric crystals, which exhibit anomalous optical characters ; but the most accurate crystal lographic determination has referred both species to the tetragonal system. Tension or compression at the time of crystallization may cause isotropic crystals to polarize light ; Schrauf has described a uniaxial diamond, and it was long since shown by Brewster that some diamonds give evidence in polarized light of compression about interior cavities. Uniaxial crystals. \u2014 A want of homogeneity in the crystals, as shown by DesCloizeaux, may cause uniaxial crystals to exhibit in polarized light a variety of abnormal phenomena. In some cases the axial figures resemble those of biaxial crystals, the cross in the middle of the field (f. 390) not being closed, but separated into two hyperbolas, lying near each other. Beryl, zircon, vesuvianite, and apatite are examples. That such crystals are nevertheless uniaxial is proved by the fact that the opening of the cross is independent of the position of the Nicols, and is not altered if the section is turned in a horizontal plane. If this is not true, or if, when the section is heated (p. 153) the distance between the hyberbolas is altered, it is a proof that the irregularity is not due to lamellar polarization, but that the two indices of refraction are not exactly equal, and consequently that the crystal is not strictly uniaxial. In such cases a revision of the crystallo graphical elements is desirable. The axial figure shown by a section of apophyllite is peculiar, exhibiting * Biot, Recherches sur la polarisation lamellaire, C. R., xii., 741, 803, S71, 967."], [173, "ANOMALIES EXHIBITED BY SOME CRYSTALS IN OPTICAL PHENOMENA. 155 a series of rings alternately7 dark violet, and yellow. The explanation is found in the fact previously stated, that it is positive for red rays, negative for blue, and does not doubly refract yellow light. Among biaxial crystals irregularities in the optical phenomena are often observed. They are due in piart to want of homogeneity, in part to twin structure, and also to other causes. In brookite the. planes of the axes for red and blue rays are at right angles to each other, and hence the axial figures vary7 much from those normally observed ; in flitanite the axial angle for the two colors is widely different, and this also gives rise to an axial figure of abnormal appearance. Irregular structure, due to twinning, is a frequent cause of peculiar opti cal phenomena; crystals, in external form apparently simple, often show themselves to be made up of irregular banded layers in twinned position, when examined in polarized light ; this is true of many minerals. In some crystals, as occasionally- in the epidote from the Untersulzbach thal in the Tyrol, the biaxial figures may be observed immediately, without the use of the polariscope. This is due to the complex twinned structure of the crystal, a thin lamella in reverse position being enclosed in the interior, so that the parts of the crystal on either side act as polarizer and analyzer. Practical Suggestions in regard to the Preparation and use of Crystal Sections made for Optical Examination. The most important task is the preparation of a plate for examination in the Stauroscope, or for the observation of the axial interference-figures. In this we are often assisted by the cleavage, which sometimes makes it possible to obtain the require I section without the labor of cutting it. This is conspicuously the c ise with mica ; also with topaz and anhydrite, and other minerals. Sometimes the natural surfaces need to be made smooth and polished. Furthermore natural crystals sometimes occur in a tabular form, thin and transparent enough to answer the purpose ; this is true of the crystals of wulfenite from Utah. In most cases, however, the section must be actually cut. The means required in such cases vary with the hardness of the mineral under examination. \u25a0 For the hardest minerals diamond powder is made use of in grinding; it is employed after the manner of the lapidary. (It may be men- tioned here that the investigator will generally find it for his interests, both as regards time, money, and accuracy of results, to employ a lapidary to do this work for him. ) The diamond powder is applied to a thin wheel of soft iron or copper, rotating on a lathe. For minerals which are not so extremely hard, good emery may be used instead of diamond powder. It is merely necessary to apply the emery and water to the edge of the wheel as it revolves, the mineral being held firmly against. A neater and more advantageous method, where the amount of material is small, is the use of a fine saw, or better wire, mounted in a frame, and used with either diamond powder or emery moistened with water or oil. The crystal may be mounted in wax or otherwise, if very small ; sometimes a holder made of cork is convenient. The direction in which the slice is to be cut is of the highest importance, and can often be indicated at first by a scratch across a plane of a crystal. In many cases it is more simple to grind on a surface in the proper direction, and this can be easily accomplished by holding the crystal against a fine-grained emery wheel rotating on a lathe. It can be held either in the fingers, or cemented to a small piece of glass, for instance with Canada balsam. Another way. more simple as demanding no instruments, is to make use of a flat piece of plate glass, not too small, on which the crystal is ground with moistened emery, being care fully moved about with the hand. In some cases a file, or even a knife, may be used, where the mineral in hand is soft. Whatever method of grinding is adopted, it is necessary to exercise great care to bring the artificial surface into exactly the proper direction. This can be determined only as its inclina tions to existing crystalline planes, or cleavage surfaces, are measured, and practically it is necessary often to stop the work and test what has been done. The parallel intersections"], [174, "156 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. will often show the degree of correctness in the work. For purposes of measurement it is necessary to polish the artificial plane, or instead, a small piece of thin glass may be cemented on where the crystal is too small for the use of the hand-goniometer. It is of course necessary to know, before starting, the angle which the new plane will make with the natural planes which are already present. When one plane in the required direction has been obtained, it is a comparatively simple process to obtain a second parallel to it, though care must be exer cised to attain accuracy. The required section having been cut, it remains only to polish the surfaces. The means required differ so widely, according to the hardness of the mineral, that no fixed rule can be given. The most commonly used polishing powder is the English red, or colcothar, which may be used on the plate of glass, or leather surface, or on a revolving wheel covered with a soft cloth. In other cases oxide of tin or fine chalk is used ; and again the simple plate of ground plass will answer the purpose without the use of any other means. As a rule, the hardest minerals take the polish most readily. Sometimes the only method practicable is to use small fragments of thin glass, adhering with balsam, by which transparency is obtained without polish, though errors are easily introduced by this means when sufficient care is not exercised. The preparation of prisms for the measurement of the indices of refraction is practically much more difficult than that of a simple section, but in general the methods are the same. It is often advisable to examine a mineral microscopically when a slice in a particular direc tion is not needed. In such cases use can be made of the methods employed in making rock slices. A revolving wheel of soft iron, vertical or horizontal, is employed, on the lateral sur face of which the substance is ground with the use of emery moistened with water. A thin slice, or thin fragment broken off, is taken to commence with. First one surface is ground smooth and polished. The piece is then cemented to a little plate of thick glass with balsam, and the other side ground down parallel to the first, the grinding being continued until the required degree of transparency is obtained. Obviously when the section becomes thin and fragile, the coarse emery must be replaced with fine, and a considerable degree of care exer cised. The section obtained is generally removed to another slip of glass and mounted with balsam under a thin glass cover. The microscopic investigation of minerals, by means of thin slices, is of the highest import ance, aside from optical investigations. Every chemical analysis should he preceded by such an examination to test the purity of the material in hand. Where a transparent section can not be obtained, a single polished surface, examined by reflected light, will often suffice to decide the same point. The valuable investigations of Vogelsang. Fischer, Rosenbusch, and others, referred to on pp. 108 to 111, show how many minerals, which at first glance seem perfectly pure, are found to enclose impurities considerable in variety and amount.

There are certain characteristics belonging to all minerals alike, crystal lized and non-crystallized, in their relation to light. These are : 1. Diaphaneity ; depending on the power of transmitting light. 2. Color; depending on the kind of light reflected or transmitted. 3. Lustre; depending on the power and manner of reflecting light. 1. Diaphaneity. The amount of light transmitted by7 a solid varies in intensity, or, in other words, of the light received more or less may be absorbed. The amount of absorption is a minimum in a perfectly transparent solid, as ice, while it is orreatest in one which is opaque, as iron. The following terms are adopted to express the different degrees in the power of transmitting light : Transparent : when the outline of an object seen through the mineral is perfectly distinct. Subtransparent, or semi-transparent : when objects are seen, but the outlines are not distinct. Translucent : when light is transmitted, but objects are not seen. Subtransluccnt : when merely the edges transmit light or are trans lucent. When no light is transmitted, the mineral is said to be opaque. This is properly only a relative term, since no substance fails to transmit some light, if made sufficiently thin. Magnetite is translucent in the Pennsbury mica. The recent researches of Prof. A. W. Wright have shown that by means of the electrical current the metals may be volatilized and deposited again on the sides of the surrounding glass tube. The layers thus formed are perfectly continuous, but so thin as to be transparent. By transmitted light the layer of gold thus obtained appears green, and that of silver a beautiful blue. The property of diaphaneity occurs in the mineral kingdom, in every decree from nearly perfect opacity to a perfect transparency, and many minerals present, in their numerous varieties, nearly all the different shades. The absorption of light in its relation to the axes of elasticity is spoken of on p. 161. 2. Color. Cause of color. \u2014 The color of a substance depends upon its power of absorbing certain portions of the light, that is, certain rays of the spectrum ; a yellow mineral, for instance, absorbs all the rays of the spectrum with the exception of the yellow. In general the color which the eye perceives is the result of the mixture of those rays which are not absorbed. All min erals may be divided into two classes : (1) those whose color is essential and belono-s to the finest particles mechanically made ; (2) those whose color is non-essential aud in the fine powder is different from what it is in the mass."], [176, "158 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. Streak. \u2014 It is obvious from these distinctions that the color of the powder, or the streak, as it is called, is often a very important quality in distino-uishing minerals. The streak is obtained by7 scratching the sur face of the mineral with a knife or file, or still better, if not too hard, by rubbing it on an unpolished porcelain surface. To die first class, mentioned above, belong the metals, and many metallic minerals ; for instance, the streak of the black manganese oxides is black ; that of hematite, which is red by transmitted light, is red, and so on. To the second class belong the silicates, and in fact the large part of all minerals. With them the color is often quite unessential, being gen erally due to small admixtures of some metallic oxide, to some carbon com pound, or some foreign substance in a finely divided state. Most of these have a white or light-colored streak. For example, the streak of Mack, green, 'red, and blue tourmaline varies little from white. Varieties of Color.

Peculiarities in the Arrangement of Colors. Play of Colors. \u2014 An appearance of several prismatic colors in rapid succession on turning the mineral. This property belongs in perfection to the diamond ; it is also observed in precious opal, and is most brilliant by candle-light."], [178, "160 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. Change of Colors. \u2014 Each particular color appears to pervade a larger space than in the play of colors, and the succession produced by turning the mineral is less rapid; Ex. labradorite. Opalescence. \u2014 A milky or pearly reflection from the interior of a speci men. Observed in some opal, and in cat's eye. Iridescence. \u2014 Presenting prismatic colors in the interior of a crystal. The phenomena of the play of colors, iridescence, etc., are sometimes to be explained by the presence of minute foreign crystals, in parallel positions; more generally, however, they are caused by the presence of fine cleavage lamella., in the light reflected from which interference takes place, analogous to the well-known Newton's rings. Tarnish. \u2014 A metallic surface is tarnished, when its color differs from that obtained by fracture ; Ex. bornite. A surface possesses the steel tar nish, when it presents the superficial blue color of tempered steel ; Ex. columbite. The tarnish is irised, when it exhibits fixed prismatic colors ; Ex. hematite of Elba. These tarnish and iris colors of minerals are owing to a thin surface film, proceeding from different sources, either from a change in the surface of the mineral, or foreign incrustation ; hydrated iron oxide, usually formed from pyrite, is one of the most common sources of it, and produces the colors on anthracite and hematite. Asferism. \u2014 This name is given to the peculiar star-like rays of light observed in certain directions in some minerals by reflected or transmitted light. This is seen in the form of a six-rayed star in sapphire, and is also well shown in mica from South Burgess, Canada. In the former case it has been attributed by Volger to a repeated lamellar twinning ; in the other case, by Rose, to the presence of minute inclosed crystals, which are a uniaxial mica, according to DesCloizeaux. Crystalline planes, which have been artificially- etched, also sometimes exhibit asterism. In general the phenomenon is explained by Schrauf as caused by the interference of the light, due to fine striations or some other cause. (Upon the above subjects, see Literature, p. 163.) PnOSPHORESCE_.CE. Phosphorescence,* or the emission of light by minerals, may be produced in different ways : by friction, by heat, or by exposure to light. By friction. \u2014 Light is readily evolved from quartz or white sugar by the friction of one piece against another, and merely the rapid motion of a feather will elicit it from some specimens of sphalerite. Friction, however, evolves light from a few only7 of the mineral species. By heat. \u2014 Fluorite is highly phosphorescent at the temperature of 300\u00b0 F. Different varieties give off light of different colors ; the chlorophane variety, an emerald-green light ; others purple, blue, and reddish tints. This phos phorescence may be observed in a dark place, by subjecting the pulverized mineral to a heat below redness. Some varieties of white limestone or marble emit a yellow light. * This subject has been investigated by Becquerel, Ann. Ch. Phys., III., Iv., 5-119, 1859; Faster, Mitth. nat. Ges. Bern, 1807, 62; and Hahn, Zeitsch. Ges. nat. Wiss. Berlin, II., ix., 1,131, 1874."], [179, "161 DIAPHANEITY COLOR \u2014 LUSTRE. By the application of heat, minerals lose their phosphorescent properties. But on passing electricity through the calcined mineral, a more or less vivid light is produced at the time of the discharge, and subsequently the specimen when heated will often emit light as before. The lioht is usually of the same color as previous to calcination, but occasionally is quite different. It is in general less intense than that of the unaltered mineral, but is much increased by a repetition of the electric discharges, and in some varieties of fluorite it may be nearly or quite restored to its former brilliancy. It has also been found that some varie ties of fluorite and some specimens of diamond, calcite, and apatite, which are not naturally phosphorescent, may be rendered so by means of electricity. Electricity will also increase the natural intensity of the phosphorescent light. light of the sun. \u2014 The only substance in which an exposure to the light of the sun produces very apparent phosphorescence is the diamond, and some specimens seem to be destitute of this power. This property is most striking after exposure to the blue rays of the spectrum, while in the red rays it is rapidly lost. Pleochroism. Dichroism, Trichroism. \u2014 In addition to the general phenomena of color, which belong to all minerals alike, some of those which are crystallized show different colors under certain circumstances. This is due to the fact that in them the absorption of parts of the spectrum takes place unequally in different directions, and hence their color by transmitted light depends upon the direction in which they are viewed. This phenomenon is called in general pleochroism. In uniaxial crystals it has been seen that, in consequence of their crystal- lographic symmetry, there are two distinct values for the velocity of light transmitted by them, according as the vibrations take place, parallel or at right angles to the vertical axis. Similarly the crystal may exert different degrees of absorption upon the rays vibrating in these two directions. For example, a transparent crystal of zircon looked through in the direction of the vertical axis appears of a pinkish-brown color, while in a lateral direc- tion the color is asparagus-green. This is because the rays (extraordinary) vibrating parallel to the axis are absorbed with the exception of those which together give the green color, and those vibrating laterally (ordinary) are absorbed except those which together appear pinkish-brown. Again, all crystals of tourmaline in the direction of the vertical axis are opaque, since the ordinary7 ray, vibrating normal to the axis c, is absorbed, while light-colored varieties, looked through laterally, are transparent, for the extraordinary ray, vibrating parallel to c, is not absorbed ; the color differs in different varieties. Thus, all uniaxial crystals may be dichroic, or have two distinct axial colors. Similarly all biaxial crystals may7 be trichroic. For the rays vibrating in the directions of the three axes of elasticity may- be differently absorbed. For dia&pore the three axial colors are azure-blue, wine-yellow, and violet blue. It will be understood that, while these three different colors are pos sible, they may not exist ; or only7 two may be prominent, so that a biaxial mineral may be called dichroic. In order to investigate the absorption-properties of any uniaxial or biaxial crystal, it is evident that sections must be obtained which are parallel to the 11"], [180, "162 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. several axes of elasticity. Suppose that f. 410 represents a rectangular solid with its sides parallel to the three axes of elasticity of 410 a biaxial crystal. In an orthorhombic crystal the faces are those of the three diametral planes or pinacoids ; in a monoclinic crystal one side coincides with the clino pinacoid, the others are to be determined for each species. The light transmitted by this solid is examined by means of a single Nicol prism. Suppose, first, that the light transmitted by the parallelopiped (f. 410) in the direction of the vertical axis is to be examined. When the shorter diagonal of the Nicol coincides with the direction of the axis b, the color observed belongs to that ray vibrating parallel to this direction ; when it coincides with the axis o, the color for the ray with vibrations parallel to a is observed. In the same way the Nicol separates the different colored ray7s vibrating parallel to c and a respectively, when the light passes through in the direc tion of b. So also finally when the section is looked through in the direction of the axis a, the colors for the rays vibrating parallel to b and c, respectively, are obtained. It is evident that the examination in two of the directions named will give the three possible colors. For epidote, according to Klein, the colors for the three axial directions are : j Vibrations parallel to i, brown (absorbed). \u201e Vibrations parallel to t, green. \" \" a, yellow. \" \" a, yellow. o Vibrations parallel to t, green, \" \" b, brown (absorbed). The colors observed by the eye alone are the resultants of the double set of vibrations, in which the stronger color predominates ; thus, in the above example, the plane, normal to c is brown, to b, yellowish-green, to a, green. In any other direction in the crystal, the apparent color is the result of a mixture of those corresponding to the three directions of vibrations in differ ent proportions. Dichroite is a striking exampde of the phenomenon of pleochroism. An instrument called a dichroscope has been contrived by Haidinger for examining this property of crystals. An oblong rhombohedron of Ice land spar has a glass prism of 18\u00b0 cemented to each extremity7. It is pviaced in a metallic cylindrical case, as in the figure, having a convex lens at one end, and a square hole at the other. On looking through it, the square hole appears double; one image belongs to the ordinary and the other to the extraordinary ray. When apleochroic crystal is examined with it, by trans mitted light, on revolving it, the two squares, at intervals of 90\u00b0 in the revo-"], [181, "163 DIAPII ANEITY \u2014 COLOR \u2014 LUSTRE. lution, have different colors, corresponding to the direction of the vibrations of the ordinary and extraordinary ray in calcite. Since the two images are situated side by side, a very slight difference of color is perceptible. Literature. \u2014 Pleochroism, Asterism, etc. LTaidinger.

The lustre of minerals varies with the nature of their surfaces. A varia tion in the quantity of light reflected, produces different degrees of intensity of lustre; a variation in the nature of the reflecting surface produces different kinds of lustre. _1. The kinds of lustre recognized are as follows : 1. Metallic : the lustre of metals. Imperfect metallic lustre is expressed bv the term sub-metallic. 2. Adamantine: the lustre of the diamond. When also sub-metallic, it is termed metallic-adamantine. Ex. cerussite, pyrargyrite. 3. Vitreous: the lustre of broken glass. Au imperfectly vitreous lustre is termed sub-vitreous. The vitreous and sub-vitreous lustres are the most common in the mineral kingdom. Quartz possesses the former in an emi nent degree ; calcite, often the latter. 4. Resinous : lustre of the yellow resins. Ex. opal, and some yellow varieties of sphalerite. 5. Pearly: like pearl. Ex. talc, brncite, stilbite, etc. When united with sub-metallic, as in hypersthenite, the term metallic-pearly is used. 6. Silky: like silk; it is the result of a fibrous structure. Ex. fibrous calcite, fibrous gypsum. __?. The degrees of intensity are denominated as follows: 1. Splendent : reflecting with brilliancy and giving well-defined images. Ex. hematite, cassiterite. 2. Shining: producing an image by reflection, but not one well defined. Ex. celestite. 3. Glistening : affording a general reflection from the surface, but no image. Ex. talc, chalcopyrite. 4. Glimmering : affording imperfect reflection, and apparently from points over the surface. Ex. flint, chalcedony. A mineral is said to be dull when there is a total absence of lustre. Ex. chalk, the ochres, kaolin."], [182, "164 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. The true difference between metallic and vitreous lustre is due to the effect which the different surfaces have upon the reflected light ; in general, the lustre is produced by the union of two simultaneous impressions made upon the eve. If the light reflected from a metallic surface be examined by a Nicol\" prism (or the dichroseope of Haidinger), it will be found that both rays, that vibrating in the plane of incidence and that whose vibra tions are normal to it, are alike, each having the color of the material, only differing a little in brilliancy ; on the contrary-, of the light reflected by a vitreous substance, those rays whose vibrations are at right angles to the plane of incidence are more or less polarized, and are colorless, while those whose vibrations are in this plane, having penetrated somewhat into the medium and suffered some absorption, show the color of the substance itself. A plate of red glass thus examined will show a colorless and a red image. Adamantine lustre occupies a position between the others. The different degrees and kinds of lustre are often exhibited differently by unlike faces of the same crystal, but always similarly by like faces. The lateral faces of a right square prism may thus differ from a terminal, and in the right rectangular prism the lateral faces also may differ from one another. For example, the basal plane of apophyllite has a pearly lustre wanting in the prismatic planes. The surface of a cleavage plane in foliated minerals, very commonly differs in lustre from the sides, and in some cases the latter are vitre.us. while the former is pearly. As shown by Haidinger, only the vitreous, adamantine, and metallic lustres belong to faces perfectly smooth and pure. In the first, the index of refrac tion of the mineral is 1 '3 \u2014 1 *8 ; in the second, 1 *9 \u2014 2 5 ; in the third, about 2 5. The pearly lustre is a result of reflection from numberless lamell\u00e6 or lines within a translucent mineral, as long since observed by Breithaupt. IV. HEAT. The expansion of crystallized minerals by heat depends, as directly as their optical properties, on the symmetry of their molecular structure as shown in their crystalline form. The same three classes as before are dis tinguished : A. Isometric crystals, where the expansion is in all directions alike. __?. Isodiametric crystals, of the tetragonal and hexagonal systems. Ex pansion vertically unlike that laterally, but in all lateral directions alike. C. Anisometric, of the orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems. Expansion unlike in the three axial directions. The expansion by heat in the case of crystals may serve to alter the angles of the form, but it has been shown that the zone relations and the crystalline system remain con stant. Mitscherlich found that in calcite there was a diminution of 8' 37\" in the angle of the rhombohedron. on passing from 32\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 F. , the form thus approaching that of a cube, as the temperature increased. Dolomite, in the same range of temperature, diminishes 4' 40 ; and in aragonite, between 63\u00b0 and 212\u00b0 F., the angle of the prism diminishes 2' 46 ', and 1-. : 1-. increases 5 30' ; in gypsum, / : .-. is increased 5 24\", 1:1. 4 12\", and 1-i : i-i is diminished 7 24\". In some rhoiubohedrons, as of calcite, the vertical axis is lengthened (and the lateral shortened), while in others, like quartz, the reverse is true. The variation is such either way that the double refraction is diminished with the increase of heat ; for calcite possesses negative double refraction, and quartz, positive. The conductive power of a crystal depends, as does expansion, on the symmetry of its crystalline form ; this is also true of its power of trails-"], [183, "165 ELECTRICITY \u2014 MAGNETISM. mitting or absorbing heat. It follows, moreover, from the analogous nature of heat and light, that heat rays are polarized by reflection, and by transmission in anisotrope media, in the same way7 as the rays of light. These subjects, considered solely in their relation to Mineralogy, are of minor importance ; they belong to works on Physics, and reference may be made to those whose titles are given in the introduction, as also to the works of Schrauf and Groth. The change in the optical properties of crystals produced by heat has already been noticed (p. 153). V. ELECTRICITY\u2014 MAGNETISM. The electric and magnetic characters of crystals, as their relations to heat, bear but slightly upon the science of mineralogy7, although of high interest to the student of physics. Frictional electricity. \u2014 The development of electricity by friction is a familiar fact. All minerals become electric by friction, although the degree to which this is manifested depends upon their conducting or non- conducting power. There is no line of distinction among minerals, divid- ing them into positively electric and negatively electric; for both kinds of electricity may be presented by different varieties of the same species, and by the same variety- in different states. The gems are positively- electric only when polished ; the diamond alone among them exhibits positive elec- tricity whether polished or not. The time of retaining electric excitement is widely different in different species, and topaz is remarkable for continu- ing excited many hours. Pressure also develops electricity in many7 minerals ; calcite and topaz are examples. Pyro-electricity. \u2014 A decided change of temperature, through heat or cold, develops electricity in a large number of minerals, which are hence called pyro-eleotric. This property is most decided, and was first observed in a series of minerals which are hemimorphic or heniihedral in their development. The electricity in these minerals is of opposite character in the parts dissimilarly modified. Thus in tourmaline and calamine, the crystals of which are often differently modified at the two extremities, posi- tive and negative electricity are developed at these extremities or poles respectively-. When the extremity becomes positive on heating it has been called the analogue pole, and when it becomes negative, it has been called the antilogue. The names were given by Rose and Riess, who investigated these phenomena. Eor a change of temperature in the opposite direction, that is, cooling, the reverse electrical effect is observed. Boracite, on whose crystals the + and \u2014 tetrahedrons often occur, shows by- heating the positive electricity for the faces of one tetrahedron and the negative for those of the other. Further investigations by Hankel and others (see Literature) have ex tended the subject and shown that the phenomena of pyro-electricity belong to the crystals of a large number of species. Moreover, it is not, as once supposed, essentially7 connected with heniihedral development. The num ber of poles, too, may be more than two, that is, the points at which posi-"], [184, "166 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. five and negative electricity is developed. Thus for prehnite there is a large series of such poles, distributed over the surface of a crystal. The investigations of Ilankel have shown in general, that in crystals not heuii hedraliy developed, the same electricity is developed at both extremities of the same axis, and the distinction between positive and negative electricity is only shown by reference to the different crystallographic axes; on sym metrically formed crystals of the isodiametric class the electricity is the same in all lateral directions, that is, on all prismatic planes, while different at the extremities of the vertical axis. Thermo-electricity. \u2014 When two different metals are brought into con tact, a stream of electricity passes from one to the other. If one is heated the effect is more decided and is sufficient to deflect more or less vigorously the needle of a galvanometer. According to the direction of the current produced by the different metallic substances, they are arranged in a thermo-electrical series; the extremes are occupied by antimony ( + ) and bismuth (\u2014 ), the electrical stream passing from bismuth to antimony. This subject is so far important for mineralogy, as it was shown by Eunseu that the natural metallic sulphides stand further off in the series than antimony and bismuth, and consequently by7 them a stronger stream is produced. The thermo-electrical relations of a large number of minerals was determined by Flight (Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxxxvi.). It was early observed that some minerals have varieties which are both + and \u2014 . This fact was made use of by Rose to show a relation between the plus and minus heniihedral varieties of pyrite and cobaltite. The later investigations of Schrauf and Dana have shown, however, that the same peculiarity belongs also to giaucodot, tetradymite, skutterudite, danaite, aud other minerals, and it is demonstrated by them that it cannot be dependent upon crystalline form, but, on the contrary7, upon chemical composition. Magnetism. \u2014 The magnetic properties of crystals are theoretically of interest, since they, too, like the optical and thermic, are directly dependent upon the form ; hence, with relation to magnetism they group themselves into the same three classes before referred to. All substances are divided into two classes, the paramagnetic and dia magnetic, according as they are attracted or repelled by the poles of a mag net. For purposes of experiment the substance in question, in the form of a rod, is suspended between the poles of the magnet, being movable on a horizontal axis. If of the first class, it will take a position parallel, and if of the second class, transverse, to the magnetic axis. By the use of a sphere it is possible to determine the relative amount of magnetic induction in different directions of the same substance. Experi ment has shown that in isometric crystals the magnetism is alike in all directions ; in those optically uniaxial, that there is a direction of maximum and, normal to it, one of minimum magnetism ; in biaxial crystals, that there are three unequal axes of magnetism, the position of which may be determined. A few minerals have the power of exerting a sensible influence upon the magnetic needle, and are hence said to be magnetic. This is true of mag netite and pyrrhotite (magnetic pyrites) in particular, also of franklinite, almandite, and other minerals, containing considerable iron protoxide (FeO). When such minerals in one part attract and in another repel the poles of"], [185, "167 TASTE AND ODOR. the magnet, they are said to possess po larit y. This is true of the variety7 of magnetite called in popular language loadstone. Literature. \u2014 Electricity. Hankel.

Taste belongs only7 to soluble minerals. The different kinds of taste adopted for reference are as follows : 1. Astringent ; the taste of vitriol. 2. Sweetish astringent ; taste of alum. 3. Saline ; taste of common salt. 4. Alkaline ; taste of soda. 5. Cooling ; taste of saltpeter. 6. Bitter ; taste of epsom salts. 7. Sour : taste of sulphuric acid. Odor. \u2014 Excepting a few gaseous and soluble species, minerals in the dry unchanged state do not give off odor. By friction, moistening with the breath, and the elimination of some volatile ingredient by heat or acids, odors are sometimes obtained which are thus designated : 1. Alliaceous ; the odor of garlic. Friction of arsenical iron elicits this odor; it may also be obtained from arsenical compounds, by means of heat. 2. Horse-radish odor ; the odor of decaying horse-radish. This odor is strongly7 perceived when the ores of selenium are heated. 3. Sulphureous ; friction elicits this odor from pyrite and heat from many sulphides. 4. Bituminous ; the odor of bitumen. 5. Fetid ; the odor of sulphuretted hydrogen or rotten eggs. It is eli cited by friction from some varieties of quartz and limestone. 6. Argillaceous ; the odor of moistened clay. It is obtained from ser-"], [186, "168 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS. pentine and some allied minerals, after moistening them with the breath ; others, as pyrargillite, afford it when heated. The Feel is a character which is occasionally of some importance ; it is said to be smooth (sepiolite), greasy (talc), harsh, or meagre, etc. Some minerals, in consequence of their hygroscopic character, adhere to the tongue, when brought in contact with it."], [187, "PART II. CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Minerals are either the uncombined elements in a native state, or com pounds of these elements formed in accordance with chemical laws. It is the object, of Chemical Mineralogy to determine the chemical composition of each species ; to show the chemical relations of different species to each other where such exist ; and also to explain the methods of distinguishing different minerals by chemical means. It thus embraces the most import ant part of Determinative Mineralogy. Chemical Constitution of Minerals. In order to understand the chemical constitution of minerals, some knowledge of the fundamental principles of Chemical Philosophy- is required ; and these are here briefly recapitulated. Chemical elements. \u2014 Chemistry recognizes sixty-four substances which cannot be decomposed, or divided into others, by any processes at present known; these substances are called the chemical elements. Of these oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are fixed gases; chlorine and fluorine are generally gases, but may be condensed to the liquid state ; bromine is a volatile liquid ; and the rest, under ordinary conditions, quicksilver excepited, are solids. Of these last carbon, phosphorus, arsenic, sulphur, boron, (tel lurium), selenium, iodine, silicon, generally rank as non-metallic elements, and the others as metallic. Molecules ; Atoms. \u2014 By a molecule is understood the smallest portion of a substance which possesses all the properties of the matter itself ; it is the smallest division into which the substance can be divided without loss or change of character. The molecule of water is the smallest conceivable particle which can exist alone, and which has all the properties of water. An atom is the smallest mass of each element which enters into combina tion with others to form the molecule. Thus two chemical units, or atoms, of hydrogen unite with one atom of oxygen to form the physical unit, or molecule, of water. Atomic weights. \u2014 The relative weights of the chemical units, or atoms, of the different elements are their atomic weights. For the sake of uni-"], [188, "170 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. formity the atom of hydrogen, the lightest of all the elements, has been adopited as the standard or unit. The absolute weight of the atoms cannot be determined ; but their relative weight can in many cases be fixed beyond question. When the elements are gases, or form gaseous compounds, the atomic weights are determined directly. Thus in hydrochloric acid gas there are equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine, or, chemically expressed, one atom of hydrogen combines with one atom of chlorine ; by analysis it is found that in 100 parts there are 2-74 by weight of hydrogen, and 9726 of chlorine ; hence if hydrogen be taken as the unit, the atomic weight of chlorine is 35-5, since 2-94 :~97-26 = 1 : 35-5. Where the elements, or their compounds, are not gases, the atomic weights are determined more or less indirectly, and are sometimes not entirely free from doubt. The analysis of rock-salt gives us, in 100 parts, 60-68 parts of chlorine, and 39-32 parts of sodium ; now if, as is believed, the number of units of each element involved is the same, or in other words, if the mole cule consists of one atom each of chlorine and sodium, then the atomic weights will be as 60-68 : 39-32 ; or 35-5 : 23, since that of chlorine \u2014 35*5. Hence the atomic weight of sodium is 23, when referred, like chlorine, to that of hydrogen as the unit. There is an assumption in such cases as to the number of units of each element involved which may introduce doubt, so that other methods are applied which need not be here detailed. The following table gives the atomic weights of the elements. The symbols used to represent an atom of each element are shown in the table ; in most cases they are the initial letter or letters of the Latin name. When more than one atom is involved in the formation of a compound, it is indicated by a small index number placed below, to the right : as Sb203, which signifies _! of antimony to 3 of oxygen. The quantity by weight of any element enter ing into a compound is always expressed either by the atomic weight or some multiple of it ; hence the atomic weights are strictly the combining weights of the different elements.

In hydrochloric acid (HOI), one atom of hydrogen combines with one of chlorine ; in water (IIaOj, two atoms of hydrogen combine with one of oxygen ; in ammonia (HSN), three atoms of hydrogen combine with one of nitrogen ; and in marsh gas (II4C), four atoms of hydrogen are required to enter into combination with one carbon atom. .By the examination of compounds of all the elements we are able to fix the combining power, or quantivalence, of each, expressed in hydrogen units. All those elements which combine with one atom of hydrogen, or an element which (like chlorine) has the same quantivalence, are called monads ; those which require two of hydrogen, or two other monad atoms, in forming the compound, are called dyads ; those uniting with three atoms of hydrogen are called triads ; and similarly tetrads, pentads, hexads, and hiptads. The adjective terms univalent, bivalent, trivalent, quadrivalent, etc., are also employed with similar meaning. Atoms having the same degree of quantivalence are said to be equivalent ; this is true of Na and ___., both monads, and they may replace each other in similar compounds ; but it requires two sodium atoms to be equivalent to one calcium atom, since the latter is a dyad. The degree of quantivalence may vary for many of the elements in different compounds ; for example, in FeO or FeS, iron (Fe) is bivalent, since it satisfies or is combined with simply a dyad ; in FeS;,, it is quadri valent, since it is united to two atoms of a dyad ; and, similarly, in [Fe..J03 it is sexivalent (for the double atom). Perissads ; Artiads. \u2014 Those elements whose atoms have an odd quanti valence (I, III, V, or VII), are called perissads ; those whose quantivalence is even (II, IV, VI) are called artiads. These terms, perissad and artiad, are derived from treptcrao'; and aprws, the words for odd and even in ancient arithmetic. The following table gives the division of the ele ments into these two classes, and shows, also, the quantivalence of each ele ment : ."], [190, "172 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Perissads. Artiads.

The general divisions of chemical compounds now accepted are as fol lows. 1. Binaries, where the atoms are directly united. Examples are given by the compounds of a positive (basic) element with oxygen (_\\\"a20, CaO, C02), called oxides ; those with sulphur, chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc., called sulpjhides, chlorides, etc. Binary compounds of a negative element with hydrogen (as IIC1, IIBr) form acids. 2. Ternaries, where the atoms are united by means of a third atom, as oxygen, sulphur, etc., as CaS04, Mg2Si04, etc. Among minerals there are three classes of compounds : (1) The Native Elements ; (2) Binary compounds, including the sulphides, oxides, chlorides, iodides, fi-uor ides ; (3) Ternary compounds, including sulpdi-arsenites, etc., hydrates (bydrated oxides), silicates, mostly salts of the acids Il4Si04 and H2Si03, tantalates, coluinbates, phosphates, arsenates, sulphates, chromates, carbonates, etc. The full enumeration of these compounds, with their gen eral chemical formulas, are given in the synopsis which precedes the Descriptive Mineralogy. The position of water in the composition of minerals. \u2014 Many minerals lose water, especially up.on the application of heat. With some of these it is given off upon mere exposure to dry air at ordinary temperature, and such crystals are said to effloresce; others lose water when they are placed in a desiccator over sulphuric acid, or when they are subjected to a slightly"], [191, "173 CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF MINERALS. elevated temperature ; with others, again, a greater heat, is required ; and with a few silicates water is yielded only upon long continued heating at a very high temperature. It is evidently possilde that either, (1) the mineral contains water as such, or (2) the water is formed by the process of decom position caused by the application of heat. In the cases first mentioned, where water is readily given off, it is believed that the water actually exists as such in the compound. It is found that many salts take up water when they crystallize, and in some cases the amount of water depends upon the temperature at which the salt is formed ; this water is called water of crystallization. For example : manganous sulphate has three definite amounts of this water of crystallization, according to the temperature at which it has been formed. When crystallized below 7\u00b0, its composition is MnSO, + 7II20; between 7\u00b0 and 20\u00b0, MnS04 + 5H20 ; and between 20\u00b0 aud 30\u00b0, MnS04+4lI20. In those cases where a very high temperature is required to make a loss of water, it is quite certain the water has no place as such in the original constitution, but, on the contrary7, that the mineral contains basic hydrogen, replacing the other basic elements. In some cases, where part of the water is yielded at a low and the rest at a very high temperature, this shows that a difference exists in regard to the part which the water plays in the two cases ; for example, crystallized sodium phosphate yields readily 24 equiva lents of water, while the remaining 1 molecule is given off only at a tem perature between 300\u00b0 and 400\u00b0 ; from this it is concluded that in the latter case the elements forming the water exist actually7 in the salt, and that its composition is : H2Na4P208 + 24aq. The part played by the water in the silicates is in most cases still unde cided, though in many species the hydrogen is undoubtedly basic. The latter is doubtless true of many of the so-called hydrous silicates. The views commonly held ill regard to them will be gathered from the descriptive part of this work. Chemical formulas for minerals. \u2014 A chemical formula expresses the relative amounts of the different, elements present in the compound, in terms of their atomic weights \u2014 or, in other words, more strictly the number of atoms of each element in a given molecule with or without the expression of their p.robable grouping. Empirical formulas simply state in the briefest form the result of the analysis, giving the number of atoms of each element present without any theoretical considerations. For example, the empirical formula of epidote is Si6Al3Ca4Il20,6. The object of the rational formulas is to express not only7 the number of atoms of each element present, but also their probable method of grouping, and relation to each other, in the molecule. These are called typical for mulas when the attempt is made to arrange the atoms in accordance with the type of water, or some other type. In the rational formulas of the old chemistry the oxy7gen (or sulphur) was apportioned to the several elements, according to their combining power, aud the basic and acid oxides, or sulphides, thus obtained were writ ten consecutively7. For example, the formula of wollastonite (calcium sili-"], [192, "174 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. cate), according to the old dualistic method, was written CaO, SiOa, and of anhydrite (calcium sulphate), CaO, S03. The principles of the new chemistry have set aside these rational formulas ; but as others consistent with the new principles now adopted have not in all cases been accepted, it is customary to give the formulas of minerals empirically. For those above the empirical formulas are CaSi03 and CaS04. Relation betioeen the old and new systems. \u2014 The points of difference between the old and new chemistry have already been hinted at. The principal changes which have been introduced by the latter are : (1) The doubling of all the atomic weights, except those of the monad elements, and also of bismuth, arsenic, antimony, nitrogen, phosphorus, and boron, whose oxides are now written Bi203, instead of Bi03, etc. Corresponding to this change, binary compounds involving the monad elements are writ ten : 11,0 instead of IIO, Na20 for IS. aO, Na2S, etc., also CaCL, instead CaCl, SiF4 instead of SiF,, and so on. (2) The method of viewing the composi tion of ternary compounds \u2014 these being now regarded not as compiounds of an oxide and a so-called acid, but as compounds for the most part of the several elements concerned, and hence a metal in a compound is believed to be replaced by another metal, not one oxide by another. Hence we say calcium carbonate, or carbonate of calcium instead of carbonate of lime, and write the formula CaC03, not CaO, C02 ; and so in the other cases. Replacing power of the different elements. \u2014 It has been mentioned that the replacing power of the elements is in proportion to their combining power, that is, to their qnantivalence. For example, one atom of Mg or of Ba may* replace one atom of Ca, all being dyads ; but two atoms of Na (monad) are required to replace one of Ca ; similarly three dyad atoms are equivalent, or may replace, one hexad atom, thus, 3Ca = [Al,]. The relation of the different oxides may be understood from the follow ing scheme, in which the above principle is made use of. The line A below contains the different kinds of oxides. B the same divided each by its number of atoms of oxygen (that is, severally, for the successive terms, by 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4), by which division they are reduced to the protoxide form. C the basic elements alone : A RO R203 RO2 R203 RO3 R207 RO4 B RO RIO R*0 RJO R*0 R'O R\u00b10 C R Rt Ri Rl R* R? Ri According to the above law the R, Rs, R*, etc., in the last line, are mutu ally replaceable, 1 for 1, though varying in atomic weight from 1 to \\. They represent different states in which elements may exist, and have, to a certain extent, independent element-like relations. In some cases, as in iron, four of these states are represented in a single element, the compounds (1) FeO, FeS, (2) Fe203, (3) FeS2, (4) FeO3, containing this metal in four states Fe, Fe\u00bb, Fe\u00bb, Fe*. The use of the fractions can be avoided by multiplying, instead of divid ing, thus, Fe8 of PVO3 replaces Fe of FeO, we might have said, 2Fe of Fe203 replaces 3Fe of FeO (Fe2Os, Fe3Os), and so for the others. These different states of the elements are best designated in the symbols"], [193, "175 CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF MINERALS. by the Greek letters a, /3, etc., thus avoiding all confusion. The above lines A, B, C then become A aEO 3/3EO 27EO B aEO /3BO 7BO C aE /SE 7B 5SBO 3eEO 7$EO SEO eBO \u00a3B0 -.EO SE eE \u00a3E t?E By means of this system all the different oxides may be reduced to the common protoxide form, and thus the true relations of the silicates may be clearly7 expressed. This is exhibited in the formulas for the silicates given in Dana's System of Mineralogy (1868). Calculation of a formula from an analysis. \u2014 The result of an analysis gives the proportions, in a hundred parts of the mineral, of either the ele ments themselves, or of their oxides or other compounds obtained in the chemical analysis. In order to obtain the atomic proportions of the ele ments : Divide the percentages of the elements by the respective atomic weights; or, for those of the oxides: Divide the percentage amounts of each by their molecular weights ; then, find the simplest ratio in whole numbers for the numbers thus obtained. Examples. \u2014 An analysis of boumonite from Meiseberg gave Rammels berg: Lead (Pb) 42-8S, copper (Cu) 13-06, antimony (Sb) 24-34, and sul phur (S) 19-76 = 100*04. Dividing each amount by its atomic weight we obtain : \u00b12-8 3 _ . 13-06 _ . 24-34 _ . 19-76 _ \"207\" - 2\u00b07' 68T ~ 6' \"122\" - \"32\"- 617\u00b0- The atomic ratio is hence :\u2014 Pb : Cu : Sb : S = -207 : -206 : -217 : -6175 ; that is, 1-005 : 1 : 1-053 : 2-998, or in whole numbers, 1:1:1:3. The empirical formula is consequently CuPbSbS3. An analysis of epidote from Untersulzbach gave Ludwig : Si02 A103 Fe03 FeO CaO H20 37-S3 22-63 15*02 0-93 23-27 2-05 = 101-73. From the results of the analysis given in this forin7 the percentage amount of each element may be calculated in the usual way ; we obtain : Si 17-65, Al 12-06, Fe 10-51, FeO 0*72, Ca 16-62, II 0.23, O 43*64. The number of atoms of each element may be calculated from the last given percentages by dividing each by the atomic weight, that is = -630 12-06 for Si, = 0-22 for Al (= Al2), etc. Or, the percentage amounts of each DO oxide maj' be divided by its molecular weight, and the result will be the same ; for Si02, the molecular weight is 60 (28 + 2x16), hence, = -630 as 22-63 bU before ; also for Al, 103 (= 2 x 27-5 + 3 x 16), and -y^- = 0-22, etc. The atomic proportions thus obtained are :"], [194, "176 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Si Al Fe Fe Ca H O 0*630 0*220 0*094 0*013 0*415 0*230 2*727, or simply -3T4 ~ (>428 6 2*99 4*07 2*2 25*79, or again, 6 3 4 2 26. The empirical formula is consequently Si6Al3Ca4H2026. As in the above case, it is necessary, when very small quantities only of certain elements are present, to neglect them in the final formula, reckoning them in with the elements which they replace, that is, with those of the same quantiva lence. The degree of correspondence between the analysis and the formula deduced, if the fatter is correctly assumed, depends entirely upon the accuracy of the former. Quantivalent Ratio.\u2014 In the chemical constitution of most minerals there exists a strong distinction between the basic and acidic elements, and this relation, in the case of substances of complex character, is often fixed when otherwise the composition is exceedingly varied. In the duahstic formulas of the old chemistry this relation was expressed in the \"oxygen ratio\" which gave the ratio between the number of oxygen atoms belong ing respectively to the bases, protoxide and sesquioxide, and to the acid. The expression, \" oxygen -ratio,\" is not in harmony with the present method of viewing chemicafcompounds, and the term has consequently been, to some extent, abandoned ; the same relation, however, between the different classes of elements still exists, but the ratio must be regarded as that exist ing between the total qnantivalences of each group of elements, and hence may be called the Quantivalent Eatio.* The old formula for all the members of the garnet family is 3E, R, 3Si = 3EO, R03, 3Si02, and the oxygen ratio for R : R : Si = 1 : 1 : 2, or for bases to silica, 1 : 1. Here E may be either Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, or Cr, and & either Al, Fe, Or. This formula, however, written according to the new system (the quantivalence being expressed by Boman numerals over the symbols), is : II VI IV II II VI E3RSi012 ; or B3R!|012l|Si, to indicate that the oxygen is regarded as all linking oxygen. The ratio of the total qnantivalences so/ each class of elements, dyads and hexads (basic), and the tetrad silicon (acidic), is :\u2014 3 x II : VI : 3 x IV, or, Q. ratio for E : R : Sis = 6 : 6 : 12, that is, 1 : 1 : 2. The same ratio for (B + R) : Si = 1 : 1, both of which are identical with the previously7 given oxygen ratio. * This relation was brought out by Prof. Dana in 1867 (Am. J. Sci., xliv., 89, 252, 398), and it forms the basis of all the formulas, according to the new system, in Dana's System of Mineralogv, 18(58. Prof. Cooke has discussed the same subject (Am. J. Sci., II., xlvii., 380, 1809), he 'calls the ratio, the Atomic Ratio ; the latter term, however, is generally used in a different sense, hence the expression Quantivalent Ratio employed here. A \\ Throughout this work the letter R, unless otherwise indicated, represents a bivalent metal, and R either Fe. Al, -Or, Mn, where the quantivalence of the double atom is six. In a few cases, to indicate further relations, the sign of the quantivalence is sometimes employed."], [195, "177 DIMORPHISM ISOMORPHISM. Thus the oxygen ratio of the old system becomes the quantivalent ratio of the new, \"a term, too, which has a wider meaning and bearing than that which it replaces.\" This principle of the ratio between the total quanti valences is an important one, and fundamental in the character of chemical compounds. This is well shown in the example here given, where, for a family of minerals of so varied composition as the garnets, it remains con stant in all varieties. Its importance is even more marked in the many silicates where R replaces 3R (as in spodumene in the pyroxene family). The quantivalent ratio is obtained by multiplying the quantivalence of each class of elements present by their number of atoms; or by dividing the percentage amount of each element by7 the atomic weight and multiply by its quantivalence. \"When the basic or acid oxides are given, divide the percentage amount of each by the molecular weight, and multiply as before by the number expressing the quantivalence, and the result is the total quantivalence for the given element. Dimorphism. Isomorphism. A chemical compound, which crystallizes in two forms genetically dis tinct, is said to be dimorphous; if in three, trimorphous, or in general pleomorphous. The phenomenon is called dimorphism, or pleomorphism. On the other hand, chemical compounds, which are of dissimilar though analogous composition, are said to be isomorphous when their crystalline forms are identical, or at least very closely related (sometimes called hom\u0153o morphous). This phenomenon is called isomorphism. An example of pleomorphism is given by the compound calcium carbon ate (CaC03), which is trimorphous : appearing as calcite, as aragonite, and as baryto-calcite. As calcite, it crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, and, unlike as its many crystalline forms are, they may be all referred to the same fundamental rhombohedron, and, what is more, they have all the same cleavage and the same specific gravity (2-7), and, of course, the same optical characters. As aragonite, calcium carbonate appears in orthorhom bic crystals, whose optical characters are entirely- different from those of calcite, as will be understood from the explanations made in the preceding chapter. Moreover, the specific gravity of aragonite (2-9) is higher than that of calcite (2*7). Again, as baryto-calcite, calcium carbonate crystal lizes in a monoclinic form. The explanation of the phenomenon of pleomorphism in this case \u2014 and au analogous explanation must answer for all such cases\u2014^is to be found, not as was once proposed in a slight variation of chemical composition, but in the different conditions in which the same compound has been formed. Thus Rose has shown that the calcium carbonate precipitated from a solu tion by the alkaline carbonates in the cold has the form of calcite, whereas, if the precipitation takes place at a temperature of 100\u00b0 O, it takes the form of aragonite. Moreover, he found that aragonite on heating fell to powder, and though no loss of weight took place, the specific gravity (2-9) became that of calcite (2-7). Many- other examples of pleomorphism may- be given : Silica (Si02) is trimorphous ; appearing as quartz, rhombohedral, G* = 2'66 ; as tridymite, 12"], [196, "178 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. hexagonal, G = 2-3 ; and as asmanite, orthorhombic, G = 2-24. Titanic oxide (Ti02) is also trimorphous, the species being called rutile, tetragonal (c = -6442), G = 4-25 ; octahedrite (c = 1-778),\" G = 3-9 ; and brooUte, orthorhombic or monoclinic, G = 4-15. Carbon appears in two forms, in diamond and graphite. Other familiar examples are pyrite and marcasite (FeS2) ; acanthi te and argentite (Ag2Sj ; sphalerite and wiirtzite (ZnS); sulphur natural, orthorhombic, if artificial and crystallizing from a molten condition, monoclinic. The relation in form of the species mentioned, and also of those of other dimorphous groups, will be found in Part III Descriptive Mineralogy. Isomorphism is well illustrated by the group of rhombohedral carbonates, with the general formula RCOs. Here R may be Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, or Zn; or further, in the same species, the R may be represented by both Ca and Mg in varying proportions, as remarked on the following page, or both Ca and Fe, etc. The group is as follows : Calcite. Dolomite. Magnesite. CaC08 Mg|2C\u00b0s MgC\u00b03 105\u00b0 5' life0 15' 107\u00b0 29' Rhodochrosite. Siderite. Smithsonite. MnC03 FeC03 ZnC03 106\u00b0 51' 107\u00b0 0' 107\u00b0 40'. Ankerite (parankerite), breunerite, mesitite, and pistomesite belong to the same group. All the above species have an analogous composition, and all crystallize in the rhombohedral system, the angle of the fundamental form varying somewhat in the different cases. Mitscherlich, who, by a series of experimental researches, established the principle of isomorphism, expressed it as follows : Substances, which are analogous chemical compounds, have the sa/me crystalline form, or an ISOMORPHOUS. Some of the more important isomorphons groups are mentioned below, for the description of the different species reference must be made to Part III. Isometric system. \u2014 (1) The spinel group, having the general formula RR04, including spinel MgA104, magnetite FeFe04, chromite Fet?r04. also franklinite, galinite, etc. (2) The alum group, for example, potash-akin _*__2AlS40lt)-l-24aq, etc. (3) The gaenet group, having the general formula R,RSi3012.

Monoclinic system . \u2014 Copperas group ; melanteriteFeS04+7aq ; bieberite CoS04-f7aq, etc. Pyroxene group, RSi03, etc. Monoclinic ami Triclinic. Feldspar group. The above enumeration includes only the more prominent among the isomorphous groups. In many other cases a close relationship exists among species, both in form and composition, as brought out in Dana's System of Mineralogy (1854), and as also to some extent exhibited in the grouping of the species in the descriptive part of this work. (1) It will be observed in the above that a replacement of an element in a compound by one or more other elements, chemically equivalent, may take place without auy essential change of the crystalline form. Besides this a part of one element may be similarly replaced. This is illustrated in the case of the rhombohedral carbonates : calcite has the composition CaC03, and magnesite MgC()3 ; but in dolomite the place of the basic element is taken by Ca and Mg in equal proportions, so that the formula may7 be written (i|Ca+-_-Mg)C03, or more properly CaMgC206. But besides this compound there are others where the ratio of Ca to Mg is 3 : 2, also 2 : 1, and 3 : 1, etc. Further than this the Ca or Mg may be in part replaced by Mn, Fe, orZn. The mineral ankerite is one in which Ca, Mg, Fe (Mn), all enter, and in different proportions. Boricky has shown that the composition of the ankerite group of compounds is expressed by the formula : \u2014 CaC03 + FeC03 -fa^CaMgCjO,;), where x may be $, 1, f, f, -\u00a7-, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. This and all similar cases are examples of isomorphous replacement. It is not essential that the replacing elements in an isomorphous series should have the same quantivalence, although this is generally true. For example, spodumene is isomorphous with the py7roxene group, though in it the bivalent element is replaced by7 a sexivalent (3R = Rj. So, too, menac- n jv canite was included in the corundum group, since here RR03 is isomor phous with R03. This relation of the elements, which are not equivalent, is brought out by7 the method of viewing the oxides presented on p. 174. (2). Minerals which crystallize in different systems may yet be isomor phous, when the difference between their geometrical form is slight ; this is conspicuously7 true of the members of the feldspar family. (3). Minerals may be closely related in form, although there is no ana logy7 whatever between their chemical composition ; many such cases have been noted, e.g., axinite and glanberite, azurite and epidote. Two substances may be both hom\u0153omorphous and correspondingly dimorpmous ; and they are then described as isodimorphous. Titanic oxide (Ti02), and stannic oxide (Sn02), are both dimorphous, and they are also hom\u0153omorphous severally7 in each of the two forms. This is an example of isodimorphism. There are also cases of isotrimorphism. Thus there are the following related groups ; the angle of the rhombohedral forms here given is R : R ; of the orthorhombic and monoclinic I : I (tor baryto-calcite 2-_* on 2-2): Rhombohedral. Orthorhombic. Monoclinic. RC03 Calcite, 105\u00b0 5'. Aragonite, 11H\u00b0 10'. Barytocalcite, 95\u00b0 8'. RSO, Dreelite, 93\u00b0-94\u00b0. Anglesite, 103\u00b0 38'. Glauberite, 833-83\u00b0 20'. RSO.+nRCO. Susannite, 94\u00b0. Leadhillite, 103\u00b0 16'. Lanarkite, 84\u00b0-"], [198, "180 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Calcite, aragonite, and barytocalcite form an undoubted case of trimor phism, as has already been shown. Dreelite, anglesite, and glauberite constitute another like series, and moreover it is closely parallel hi angle with the former. In the third line we have the sulphato-carbonate susan nite near dreelite in angle, leadhillite (identical with susannite in composi tion) near anglesite, and lanarkite, another sulphato-carbonate, near glau berite, forming thus a third parallel line. The sulphuric acid in these sul phato-carbonates dominates over the carbonic acid, and gives the form of the sulphates enumerated in the second line of the table. Chemical Examination of Minerals. The chemical characters of minerals are ascertained (as) by the action of acids and other reagents ; (b) by means of the blowpipe assisted by a few chemical reagents ; (c) by chemical analysis. The last method is the only one by which the exact chemical composition of a mineral can be deter mined. It belongs, however, wholly- to chemistry, and it is unnecessary to touch upon it here except to call attention to the remarks already made (p. 156) upon the essential imp.ortance of the use of pure material for analysis. The various tests and reactions of the wet and dry methods are important, since they often make it possible to determine a mineral with very little labor, and this with the use of the minimum amount of material. a. Examination in the Wet Way. The most common chemical reagents are the three mineral acids, hydro chloric, nitric, and sulphuric. In testing the powdered mineral with these acids, the important points to be noted are: (1) the degree of solubility, and (2) the phenomena attending entire or partial solution ; that is, whether a gas is evolved, producing effervescence, or a solution is obtained without effervescence, or an insoluble constituent is separated out. Solubility. \u2014 In testing the degree of solubility hydrochloric acid is most commonly used, though in the case of sulphides, and compounds of lead and silver, nitric acid is required. Less often sulphuric acid, and aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), are resorted to. Many- minerals are completely7 soluble without effervescence : among these are some of the oxides, hematite, limonite, gothite, etc., some sulphates, many phosphates and arseniat.es, etc. Solubility with effervescence takes place when the mineral loses a gaseous ingredient, or when one is generated by the mutual decomposition of acid and mineral. Most conspicuous here are the carbonates, all of which dissolve with effervescence, giving off carbonic acid (properly carbon dioxide, C02), though some of them only when pulverized, or again, on the addition of heat. In applying this test dilute hydrochloric acid is employed. Sul phuretted hydrogen (H2S) is evolved by some sulpihides, when dissolved in hydrochloric acid: this is true of sphalerite, stibnite, greenockite, etc. Chlorine is evolved by oxides of manganese and also chromic and vanadic acid salts, when dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Nitric peroxide is given off by many metallic minerals, and also some of the lower oxides (cuprite, etc.), when treated with nitric acid."], [199, "181 CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. The separation of an insoluble ingredient takes place : \"With many sili cates, the silica separating sometimes as a fine powder, and again as a jelly ; in the latter case the mineral is said to gelatinize (sodalite, analcite). In order to test this point the finely pulverized silicate is digested with strong hydrochloric acid, and the solution afterward slowly evaporated nearly to dryness. With a considerable number of silicates the gelatinization takes place only after ignition ; while others, which ordinarily gelatinize, are rendered insoluble by ignition. With many sulphides a separation of sulphur takes place when they7 are treated with nitric acid. Compounds of titanic and tungstic acids are decomposed by hydrochloric acid with the separation of the oxides named. The same is true of salts of molybdic and vanadic acids, only7 that here the oxides are soluble in an excess of the acid. Compounds containing silver, lead, and mercury give with hydrochloric acid insoluble residues of the chlorides. These compounds are, however, soluble in nitric acid. When compiounds containing tin are treated with nitric acid, the stannic oxide separates as a white powder. A corresponding reaction takes place under similar circumstances with minerals containing arsenic and antimony. Insoluble minerals. \u2014 A large number of minerals are not sensibly attacked by any of the acids. Among these may be named the following oxides: corundum, spinel, chromite, diaspore, rutile, cassiterite, quartz; also cerargyrite ; many silicates, titanates, tantalates, and columbates ; also the sulphates (barite, celestite, anglesite) ; many phosphates (xenotime, lazulite, childrenite, amblygonite), and the borate, boracite. _>. Examination of Minerals by means of the Blowpipe. Blowpipe. \u2014 The simplest form of the blowpipe is a tapering tube of brass (f. 413, 1), with a minute aperture at the a tapering tube of extremity. A chamber is advantageously added (f. 413, 2) at o, to receive the condensed moisture, and an ivory mouth-piece is often very convenient. In the better forms of the instrument (see f. 413, 3), the tip is made of solid platinum (f), which admits of being readily cleaned when necessary. Operations with the blowpipe often require an uninter mitted heat for a considerable length of time, and always longer than a single breath of the operator. It is therefore requisite that breath ing and blowing should go on together. This may be difficult at first, but the necessary skill or tact is soon acquired. Blmopipe-flame. \u2014 The best and most con venient source of heat for blowpipe purposes is ordinary illuminating gas. The burner is a simple tube, flattened at the top, and cut off a little obliquely ; it thus furnishes a flame of convenient shape. A similar"], [200, "182 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. jet may also be used in conjunction with the ordinary Bunsen burner, it being so made as to slip down within the outer tube, and cut off the supply* of air, thus giving a luminous flame. The gas flame required need not be more than an inch and a half in height. In* place of the gas, a lamp fed with olive oil will answer, or even a good candle. The jet of the blowpipe is brought close to the gas flame on the higher side of the obliquely terminated burner. The arm of the blowpipe is inclined a little downward, and the blast of air produces an oblique conical flame of intense heat. This blowpipe flame consists of two cones : an inner of a blue color, and an outer cone which is yellow. The heat is most intense just beyond the extremity of the blue flame, and the mineral is held at this point when its fusibility is to be tested. The inner flame is called the reducing flame (R.F.) ; it is characterized by the excess of the carbon or hydrocarbons of the gas, which at the high temperature piresent tend to combine with the oxygen of the mineral brought into it, or in other words, to reduce it. The best reducing flame is produced when the blowpipe is held a little distance from the gas flame ; it should retain the yellow color of the latter. The outer cone is called the oxidizing flame (O.F.) ; it is characterized by the excess of the oxygen of the air over the carbon of the gas to be com bined with it, and has hence an oxidizing effect upon the assay. This flame is best produced when the jet of the blowpipe is inserted a very little in the gas flame ; it should be entirely non-luminous. Supports. \u2014 Of other apparatus required, the most essential articles are those which serve to support the mineral in the flame; these supports are: (1) charcoal, (2) platinum forceps, (3) platinum wire, and (4) glass tubes. (1) Charcoal is especially useful as a support in the case of the examina tion of metallic minerals, where a reduction is desired. It must not crack when heated, and should not yield any considerable amount of ash on com bustion ; that made from soft wood (pine or willow) is the best. Pieces of convenient size for holding in the hand are employed ; they should have a smooth surface, and a small cavity should be in it made for the mineral. (2) A convenient kind of platinum forceps is represented in f. 414 ; it is made of steel with platinum points. These open by means of the pins pp ; other forms open by the spring of the wire in the handle. Care must be taken not to heat any substance (e.g., metallic) in the forceps, which when fused might injure the platinum. (3) Platinum wire is employed with the use of fluxes, as described in another place. (4) The glass tubes required are of two kinds : closed tubes, having only one open end, about four inches long ; and open tubes, having both ends open, four to six inches in length. Both kinds can be easily made by the student from ordinary tubing (best of rather hard glass), having a bore of \u2022\u00a3 to -\u00a7\u2022 of an inch."], [201, "183 CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. In the way of additional apparatus, the following articles are useful ; they need no special description : hammer, small anvil, three-cornered file, mag net, pliers, pocket-lens, and a small mortar, as also a few of the test-tubes, etc., used in the laboratory. Chemical reagents. \u2014 The commonest reagents employed are the fluxes, viz., soda (sodium carbonate) ; salt of phosphorus (sodium-ammonium phosphate) ; and borax (sodium biborate). The method of using them is spoken of on p. 1S6. Nitrate of cobalt in solution is also employed. It is conveniently kept in a small bulb from which a drop or two may be obtained as it is needed. This is used principally as a test for aluminum or magnesium with infusible minerals, as remarked beyond. The fragment of the mineral held in the forceps is first ignited in the blowpipe flame, a drop of the cobalt solution is placed on it, and then it is heated again ; the presence of either constitu ent named is manifested by the color assumed by the ignited mineral. It is also used as a test for zinc. Potassium bisulphate and calcium fluoride (fluorite) in powder, metallic magnesium (foil or wire), aud tin foil, are other reagents, the use of which is explained later. Test-papers are also needed, viz., blue litmus paper, aud turmeric paper. The wet reagents required are: the ordinary acids, and most important of these hydrochloric acid, generally diluted one-half for use, and also barium chloride, silver nitrate, ammonium niolybdate. The blowpipe investigation of minerals includes their examination, (1) in the platinum-pointed forceps, (2) in the closed tube, (3) in the open tube, (4) on charcoal, aud (5) with the fluxes. (1) Examination in the forceps. \u2014 The most important use of the plati num-pointed forceps is to hold the fragment of the mineral while its fusi bility7 is tested. The following practical points must be regarded : (1) Metallic minerals, which when fused may injure the platinum, should be examined on charcoal ; (2) the fragment taken should be thin, and as small as can conveniently be held ; (3) when decrepitation takes place, the heat must be applied slowly, or, if this does not prevent it, the mineral may be powdered and a paste made with water, thick enough to be held in the forceps or on the platinum wire ; or the paste may, with the same end in view, be heated on charcoal ; (4) the fragment whose fusibility is to be tested must be held in the hottest part of the flame, just beyond the extremity of the blue cone. In connection with the trial of fusibility, the following phenomena may be observed : (a) a coloration of the flame ; (b) a swelling up (stilbite), or an exfoliation of the mineral (vermiculite) ; or (c) a glowing without fusion (calcite) ; and (d) an intumescence, or a spirting out of the mass as it fuses (scapolite). The color of the mineral after ignition is to be noted ; and the nature of the fused mass is also to be observed, whether a clear or blebby glass is obtained, or a black slag, or whether magnetic or not, etc. The ignited fragment, if nearly or quite infusible, may be moistened with the cobalt solution and again ignited (see above) ; also, if not too fusible, it may, after treatment in the forceps, be placed upon a strip of moistened turmeric paper, in which case an alkaline reaction shows the presence of the alkaline earths. Fusibility. \u2014 All grades of fusibility exist among minerals, from those"], [202, "184 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. which fuse in large fragments in the flame of the candle (stibnite, see below), to those which fuse only on the thinnest edges in the hottest blow pipe flame (bronzite) ; and still again there are a considerable number which are entirely infusible (e.g., corundum). The following scale of fusibility, proposed by von Kobell, is made use of: 1, stibnite ; 2, natrolite ; 3, almandine garnet ; 4, actinolite ; 5, ortho clase ; 6, bronzite. A little practice with these minerals will show the student what degree of fusibility is expressed by each number, and render him quite independent of the table ; he will thus be able also to judge of his power to produce a hot flame by the blowpipe, which requires practice. Flarrte coloration. \u2014 When coloration is produced it is seen on the exterior portion of the flame, and is best observed when shielded from the direct light. The presence of soda, even in small quantities, produces a yellow flame, which (except in the spectroscope) more or less completely masks the coloration of the flame due to other sub stances ; phosphates and borates give the green flame in general best when they have been pulverized and moistened with sulphuric acid ; moistening with hydrochloric acid makes the coloration in many cases (barium, strontium) more distinct. The colors which may be produced, and the substances to whose presence they are due, are as follows : (1) yellow, sodium ; (2) violet, potassium ; (3) purple-red, lithium ; red, strontium ; yellowish-red, calcium (lime) ; (4) yellowish-green, barium, molybdenum ; emerald-green, copper ; bluish green, phosphorus (phosphates) ; yellowish-green, bo/ 'on (borates) ; (5) blue, azure-blue, copper chloride; light-blue, arsenic / greenish-blue, antimony. (2) Heating in the closed tube. \u2014 The closed tube is employed to show the effect of heating the mineral out of contact with the air. A small frag ment is taken, or sometimes the powdered mineral is inserted, though in this case with care not to soil the sides of the tube. The phenomena which may be observed are as follows : decrepitation, as shown by fluorite, calcite, etc. ; glowing, as exhibited by gadolinite ; phosphorescence, of which fluorite is an example ; change of color (limonite), and here the color of the mineral should be noted both when hot, and again after cooling ; fusion ; giving off oxygen, as mercuric oxide ; yielding water at a low or high temperature, which is true of all hydrous minerals ; yielding acid or alkaline vapors, which should be tested by- inserting a strip of moistened litmus or turmeric paper in the tube; yielding a sublimate, which condenses in the cold part of the tube. Of the sublimates which form in the tube, the following are those with which it is most important to be familiar: Sublimate yellow, sulph ur; dark brown-red when hot, and red or reddish-yellow when cold, arsenic sulphide; brilliant black, arsenic (also giving off a garlic odor); black when hot, brown-red when cold, formed near the mineral by strong heating, antimony oxysulphide ; dark-red, selenium (also giving the odor of decay ing horseradish) ; sublimate consisting of small drops with metallic lustre, tellurium ; sublimate gray, made up of minute metallic globules, mercury ; sublimate black, lustreless, red when rubbed, mercury sulphide. (3) Heating in the open tube. \u2014 The small fragment is placed in the tube about an inch from the lower end, the tube being inclined sufficiently to prevent the mineral from slipping out. The current of air, passing through"], [203, "185 CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. the tube during the heating process, has an oxidizing effect. The special phenomena to be observed are the formation of a sublimate and the odor of the escaping gases. The acid or alkaline character of the vapors are tested in the same way as with the closed tube. Fluorides, when heated in the open tube with previously fused salt of phosphorus, yield hydrofluoric acid, which gives an acid reaction with test-paper, has a peculiar pungent odor, and corrodes the glass. The sublimates which may be formed, as far as they differ from those already mentioned, as obtained in the closed tube, are as follows : Subli mate, white and crystalline, volatile, arsenous oxide ; white, near the min eral crystalline, fusible to minute drops, yellowish when hot, nearly color less when cold, molybdic oxide ; sublimate white, yielding dense white fumes, at first mostly volatile, forming on the upper side of the tube, and afterward generally non- volatile on the under side of the tube, antimonous aud antimonic oxides; sublimate dark brown when hot, lemon-yellow when cold, fusible, bismtdh oxide; sublimate gray, fusible to colorless drops, tellurous oxide ; sublimate steel-gray, the upper edge appearing red, selenium ; sublimate bright metallic, mercury. The odors which may be perceived are the same as those mentioned in the following article. (4) Heating alone on charcoal. \u2014 The substance to be examined is placed in a shallow cavity ; it may7 simply7 be a small fragment, or, where the mineral decrepitates, it may be powdered, mixed with w-ater, and thus the material employed as a paste. The pioints to be noticed are : (a) The odor given oil after short heating. In this way the presence of sulphur, arsenic (garlic odor), and selenium (odor of decayed horseradish), may be recognized. (b) Fusion. \u2014 In the case of the salts of the alkalies the fused mass is absorbed into the charcoal ; this is also true, after long heating, of the car bonates and sulphates of barium and strontium. (c) The infusible residue. \u2014 This may (1) glow brightly in the O.F., indi cating the presence of calcium, strontium, magnesium, zirconium, zinc, or tin. (2) It may give an alkaline reaction after ignition : alkaline earths. (3) It may7 be magnetic, showing the presence of iron. (d) The sublimate. \u2014 By this means the presence of many of the metals may be determined. The color of the sublimate, both near the assay (N), and at a distance (D) ; as also when hot and when cold is to be noted. The most important of the sublimates, with the metals to which they- are due, are contained in the following list: Sublimate, steel-gray (N), and dark gray (D), in E.F. volatile with a blue flame, selenium (also giving a peculiar odor) ; white (N) aud red or deep yellow (D), in E.F. volatile with green flame, tellurium ; white (N) and grayish (D), arsenic (giving also a peculiar alliaceous odor); white (N) and bluish (D), ant imo ny (also giving off dense white fumes). Reddish-brown, silver ; dark orange-yellow when hot, and lemon-yellow when cold (N), also bluish-white (D), bismuth ; dark lemon-yellow when hot, sulphur-yellow when cold, lead ; red-brown (N) and orange-yellow (D), cadmium ; yellow when hot, white on cooling, zinc (the sublimate becomes green if moistened with cobalt solution and again ignited) ; faint yellow when hot, white on cooling, tin (the sublimate becomes bluish-green when ignited after being moistened with the cobalt"], [204, "186 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. solution, in the R.F. it is reduced to metallic tin) ; yellow, sometimes crys talline when hot, white when cold (N), bluish (D), molybdenum (in O.F. the sublimate volatilizes, leaving a permanent stain of the oxide, in E.F. gives an azure blue color when touched for a moment with the flame). ' (5) Treatment with the fluxes. \u2014 The three fluxes have been mentioned on p. 183. They are used either on charcoal or with the platinum wire. If the latter is empdoyed it must have a small loop, at the end ; this is heated to redness and dipped into the powdered flux, and the adhering particles fused to a bead ; this operation is repeated until the loop is filled. Some times in the use of soda the wire may at first be moistened a little to cause it to adhere. When the bead is ready it is, while hot, brought in contact with the powdered mineral, some of which will adhere to it, and then the heating process may be continued. Very7 little of the mineral is in general required, and the experiment should be commenced with a minute quantity and more added if necessary. The bead must be heated successively in the reducing and oxidizing flames, and in each case the color noted when hot and when cold. The phenomena connected with fusion, if it takes place, must also be observed. Minerals containing sulphur or arsenic, or both, must be first roasted, that is, heated on charcoal, first in the oxidizing and then in the reducing flame, till these substances have been volatilized. If too much of the mineral has been added and the bead is hence too opaque to show the color, it may, while hot, be flattened out with the hammer, or drawn out into a wire, or part of it may be removed and the remainder diluted with more of the flux. Borax. \u2014 The following list enumerates the different colored beads obtained with borax, and also the metals to the presence of whose oxides the colors are due : Colorless ; silica, aluminum, the alkaline earths, etc. (both O.F. and R.F.) ; also silver, zinc, cadmium, lead, bismuth, and nickel, O.F., and also R.F., after long heating, but when first heated, gray or turbid ; R.F., man ganese. Yellow ; in O.F., titanium, tungsten, and molybdenum, also zinc and cadmium, when strongly saturated and hot; vanadium (greenish when hot) ; iron, uranium, and chromium, when feebly saturated. Red to brown ; in O.F., iron, hot (on cooling, yellow) ; O.F., chromium, hot (yellowish-green when cold) ; O.F., uranium, hot (yellow when cold) ; nickel, manganese, cold (violet when hot). Red ; E.F., copper, if highly saturated, cold (colorless when hot). Violet; O.F., nickel, hot (red-brown to brown on cooling); O.F., man ganese. i* _tin. o_. Blue; O.F. and B.F., cobalt, both hot and cold; O.F., copper, cold (when hot, green). Green ; O.F., copper, hot (blue or greenish-blue on cooling), E.F., bottle green ; O.F., chromium, cold (yellow to red when hot), B.F., emerald-green; O.F., vanadium, cold (yellow when hot), B.F., chrome-green, cold (brown ish when hot) ; B.F., uranium, yellowish-green (when highly7 saturated). Salt of Phosphorus. \u2014 This flux gives for the most part reactions similar to those obtained with borax. The only7 cases enumerated here are those which are distinct, aud hence those where the flux is a good test. With silicates this flux forms a glass in which the bases of the silicate"], [205, "187 CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MINERALS. are dissolved, but the silica itself is left insoluble. It appears as a skeleton readily seen floating about in the melted bead. The colors of the beads and the metals to whose oxides these are due, are : Blue ; E.F., tungsten, cold (brownish when hot); B.F., columbium, cold and when highly saturated (dirty-blue when hot). Both these give colorless beads in the O.F. Green ; E.F., uranium, cold (yellowish-green when hot) ; O.F., molyb denum, pale on cooling, also B.F., dirty-green when hot, green when cold. Violet ; B.F., columbium (see above) ; B.F., titanium cold (yellow when hot). Soda is especially- valuable as a flux in the case of the reduction of the metallic oxides ; this is usually- performed on charcoal. The finely7 pulver ized mineral is intimately mixed with soda, and a drop of water added to form a paste. This is placed in a cavity in the charcoal, and subjected to a strong reducing flame. More soda is added as that present sinks into the coal, and, after the process has been continued some time, the remainder of the flux, the assay, and the surrounding coal are cut out with a knife, and the whole ground up in a mortar, with the addition of a little water. The charcoal is carefully washed away and the metallic globules, flattened out by the process, remain behind. Some metallic oxides are very readily reduced, as lead, while others, as copper and tin, require considerable skill and care. The metals obtained may be: iron, nickel, or cobalt, recognized by their being attracted by the magnet ; or copper, marked by- its red color ; bis muth and antimony, which are brittle ; gold or silver ; antimony, tellurium, bismuth, lead, zinc, cadmium, which volatilize more or less completely and may be recognized by their sublimates (see p. 1S5) ; arsenic and mercury are also reduced, but must be heated with soda in the closed tube in order to collect the sublimates. The metals obtained may be also tested with borax on the platinum wire. By means of soda on charcoal the presence of sulphur in the sulphates may be shown, though they do not yield it upon simple heating. When soda is fused on charcoal with a compound of sulphur (sulphide or sulphate), sodium sulphide is formed, and if much sulphur is present the mass will have the hepar (liver -brown) color. In any case the presence of the sulphur is shown by placing the fused mass on a clean surface of silver, and adding a drop of water ; a black or yellow stain of silver sulphide will be formed. Illuminating gas often contains sulphur, and hence, when it is used, the soda should be first tried alone on charcoal, and if a sulphur reaction is obtained (due to the gas), a candle or lamp must be employed in the place of the gas. It is also useful in the case of many- minerals to test their fusibility or infusibility- with soda, generally on the platinum wire. Silica forms if not in excess a clear glass with soda, so also titanic acid. Salts of barium and strontium are fusible with soda, but the mass is absorbed by the coal. Many silicates, though alone difficultly7 fusible, dissolve in a little soda to a clear glass, but with more soda they7 form an infusible mass. Manganese, when present even in minute quantities, gives a bluish-green color to the soda bead."], [206, "188 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. Characteristic Reactions op the most Important Elements and op some op their Compounds. The following list contains the most characteristic reactions, both before the blowpipe (B.B.) and in some cases in the wet way, of the different ele ments and their oxides. It is desirable for every student to be familiar with them. Many of them have already been briefly mentioned in the preceding pages. It is to be remembered that while the reaction of a single substance may be perfectly distinct if alone, the presence of other substances may more or less entirely obscure these reactions ; it is conse quently obvious that in the actual examination of minerals precautions have to be taken, and special methods have to be devised, to overcome the diffi culty arising from this cause. These will be gathered from the pyrognostic characters given (by Prof. Brush) in connection with the description of each spiecies in the Third Part of this work. For many substances the most satisfactory and delicate tests are those which have been given by Bunsen in his important piaper on Flame-reac tions (Flammenreactionen, Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxxxviii., 257, or Phil. Mag., IV., xxxii., 81). The methods, however, require for the most part much detailed explanation, and in this place it is only possible to make this gen eral reference to the subject. Alumina. B.B. ; the presence of alumina in most infusible minerals, containing a considerable amount, may be detected by the blue color which they assume when, after being heated, they are moistened with cobalt solu tion and again ignited. Very hard minerals (e.g., corundum) must be first finely pulverized. Antimony. B.B. ; antimonial minerals on charcoal give dense white inodorous fumes. Antimony sulphide gives in a strong heat in the closed tube a sublimate, black when hot, brown-red when cold. See also p. 185. In nitric acid compounds containing antimony deposit white antimoniu oxide (Sb205). Arsenic. B.B. ; arsenical minerals give off fumes, usually easily recog nized by their peculiar garlic odor. In the open tube they give a white, volatile, crystalline sublimate of arsenious oxide. In the closed tube arsenic sulphide gives a sublimate dark brown-red when hot, and red or reddish yellow when cold. The presence of arsenic in minerals is often proved by testing them in the closed tube with sodium carbonate and potassium cyan ide. Strong heating piroduces a sublimate of metallic arsenic, proper pre cautions being observed. Baryta. B.B. ; a yellowish-green coloration of the flame is given by all baryta salts, excepit the silicates. In solution the presence of barium is proved by the heavy white precipi tate formed upon the addition of dilute sulphuric acid. Bismuth. B.B. ; on charcoal alone, or with soda, bismuth gives a very characteristic orange-yellow sublimate (p. 185). Also when treated with equal parts of potassium iodide and sulphur, and fused on charcoal, a beauti ful red sublimate of bismuth iodide is obtained. Boracic acid. Borates. B.B. ; many compounds tinge the flame intense yell (j wish-green, especially if moistened with sulphuric acid. For silicates"], [207, "CHARACTERISTIC REACTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. 189 the best method is to mix the powdered mineral with one part powdered fluorite and two parts potassium bisulphate. The mixture is moistened and placed on platinum wire. At the moment of fusion the green color appears, but lasts but a moment (ex. tourmaline). Heated in a dish with sulphuric acid, and alcohol being added and ignited, the flames of the latter will be distinctly tinged green. Cadmium. B.B. ; on charcoal cadmium gives a characteristic sublimate of the reddish-brown oxide (p. 185). Carbonates. Effervesce with dilute hydrochloric acid ; many require to be pulverized, and some need the addition of heat. Chlorides. B.B. ; if a small portion of a chloride is added to the bead of salt of phosphorus, saturated with copper oxide, the bead is instantly sur rounded with an intense purplish flame. In solution they give with silver nitrate a white curdy precipitate, which darkens in color on exposure to the light ; it is insoluble in nitric acid, but entirely so in ammonia. Chromium. B.B. ; chromium gives with borax and salt of phosphorus an emerald-green bead (p. 1S6). Cobalt. B.B. ; a beautiful blue bead is obtained with borax in both flames from minerals containing cobalt. Where sulphur or arsenic is present it should first be roasted off on charcoal. Copper. B.B. ; on charcoal the metallic copper can be reduced from most of its compounds. With borax it gives a green bead in the oxidizing flame, and in the reducing an opaque red bead (p. 1S6). Most metallic compounds are soluble in nitric acid. Ammonia produces a green precipitate in the solution, which is dissolved when an excess is added, the solution taking an intense blue color. Fluorine. B.B. ; heated in the closed tube fluorides give off fumes of hydrofluoric acid, which react acid with test-paper and etch the glass. Sometimes potassium bisulphate must be added (see also p. 185). Heated gently in a platinum crucible with sulphuric acid, most com pounds give off hydrofluoric acid, which corrodes a glass plate placed over it. Iron. B.B. ; with borax iron gives a bead (O.F.) which is yellow while hot, but is colorless on cooling ; E.F., becomes bottle-green (see p. 186). On charcoal with soda gives a magnetic powder. Minerals which contain even a small amount of iron yield a magnetic mass when heated in the reducing flame. I- ad. B.B. ; with soda on charcoal a malleable globule of metallic lead is obtained from lead compounds ; the coating has a yellow color near the assay and farther off a white color (carbonate) ; on being touched with the reducing flame both of these disappear, tinging the flame azure blue. In solutions dilute sulphuric acid gives a white precipitate of lead sul phate ; when delicacy is required an excess of the acid is added, the solution evaporated to dryness, and water added, the lead sulphate, if present, will then lie left as a residue. lime. B.B. ; it imparts a yellowish-red color to the flame. In the pres ence of other alkaline earths the spectroscope gives a sure means of detecting even when in small quantities. Many- lime salts give an alkaline reaction with test-paper after ignition."], [208, "190 CHEMICAL MINERALOGY. In solutions containing lime salts, even when dilute, ammonium oxalate throws down a white precipitate of calcium oxalate. lithia. B.B. ; lithia gives an intense red to the outer flame ; in very small quantities it is evident in the spectroscope. Magnesia. B B. ; moistened, after heating, with cobalt nitrate and again ignited, a pink color is obtained from infusible minerals. Manganese. B.B. ; with borax manganese gives a bead violet- red (O.F.), and colorless (E.F.). With soda (O.F.) it gives a bluish-green bead ; this reaction is very delicate and may7 be relied upon, even in presence of almost any other metal. Mercury. B.B. ; in the closed tube a sublimate of metallic mercury is yielded when the mineral is heated with soda. Mercuric sulphide gives a black lustreless sublimate in the tube, red when rubbed (p. 185). Molybdenum. B.B. ; on charcoal molybdenum gives a copper-red stain (O.F.) which becomes azure-blue when for a moment touched with the E.F. (p. 186). Nickel. B.B. ; with borax nickel oxide gives a bead which (O.F.) is violet when hot and red-brown on cooling; (E.F.) the glass becomes gray and turbid from the separation of metallic nickel, and on long blowing colorless. Nitrates. Detonate when heated on charcoal. Heated in a tube with sulphuric acid give off red fumes of nitric pteroxide. Phosphates. B.B. ; most phosphates impart a green color to the flame, especially after having been moistened with sulphuric acid, though this test may7 be rendered unsatisfactory by the presence of other coloring agents. If they are used in the closed tube with a fragment of metallic magnesium or sodium, and afterward moistened with water, phosphuretted hydrogen is given off, recognizable by its disagreeable odor. A few drops of a neutral or acid solution, containing phosphoric acid, produces in a solution of ammonium molybdate with nitric acid a pulveru lent yellow precipitate. Potash. B.B. ; potash imparts a violet color to the flame when alone. It is best, detected in small quantities, or when soda or lithia is present, by the aid of the spectroscope. Selenium. B.B. ; on charcoal selenium fuses easily, giving off brown fumes with a peculiar disagreeable organic odor (see also p. 185). Silica. B.B. ; a small fragment of a silicate in the salt of phosphorus bead leaves a skeleton of silica, the bases being dissolved. If a silicate in a fine powder is fused with sodium carbonate and the mass then dissolved in hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness, the silica is made insoluble, and when strong hydrochloric acid is added and then water, the bases are dissolved and the silica left behind. Many silicates, especially those which are hydrous, are decomposed by strong hydrochloric acid, the silica separating as a powder or as a jellv (see p. 181). Silver. B.B. ; on charcoal in O.F. silver gives a brown coating (p. 185j. A globule of metallic silver may generally be obtained by heating on char coal in O.F., especially if soda is added. Under some circumstances it is desirable to have recourse to cupellation. From a solution containing any salt of silver, the insoluble chloride is thrown down when hydrochloric acid is added. This precipitate is insoluble"], [209, "191 DETERMINATIVE MINERALOGY. in acid or water, but entirely so in ammonia. It changes color on exposure to the light. Soda. B.B. ; gives a strong yellow flame. Sulphur, sulphides, sulphates. B.B. ; in the closed tube some sulphides give off sulphur, others sulphurous oxide which reddens a strip of moistened litmus paper. In small quantities, or in sulphates, it is best detected by fusion on charcoal with soda. The fused mass, when sodium sulphide has thus been formed, is placed on a clean silver coin and moistened ; a distinct black stain on the silver is thus obtained (the precaution mentioned on p. 187 must be exercised). A solution in hydrochloric acid gives with barium chloride a white in soluble precipitate of barium sulphate. / Tellurium. B.B. ; tellurides heated in the opeA tube give a white or grayish sublimate, fusible to colorless drops (p. 185)^ On charcoal they give a white coating and color the E.F. green. Tin. B.B ; minerals containing tin, when heated on charcoal with soda or potassium cyanide, y7ield metallic tin in minute globules (see also p. 187j. Titanium. B.B. ; titanium gives a violet color to the salt of phosphorus bead. Fused with sodium carbonate and dissolved with hydrochloric acid, and heated with a piece of metallic tin or zinc, the liquid takes a violet color, especially7 after piartial evaporation. Tungsten. B.B. ; tungsten oxide gives a blue color to the salt of phos phorus bead (B.F.). Fused and treated as titanic acid (see above) with the addition of zinc instead of tin, gives a fine blue color. Uranium. B.B. ; salt of phosphorus bead, in O.F., a greenish-y-ellow bead when cool. In E.F. a fine green on cooling (p. 187). Vanadiumr. B.B. ; the characteristic reactions of vanadium with the fluxes are given on p. 186. Zinc. B.B. ; on charcoal compounds of zinc give a coating which is yel low-white hot and white on cooling, and moistened by the cobalt solution and again heated becomes a fine green (p. 185). Zirconia. A dilute hydrochloric acid solution, containing zirconia, im parts an orange-yellow color to turmeric paper, moistened by the solution. Students who desire to become thoroughly- acquainted with the use of the blowpipe should provide themselves with a thorough and systematic book devoted to the subject. The most complete American book is that by Prof. Brush (Manual of Determinative Mineralogy, with an introduction on blow pipe analysis, New York, 1875). Other standard works are those of Ber zelius (The use of the Blowpipe in Chemistry and Mineralogy, translated into English by Prof. J. D. Whitney, 1845), and Plattner (Manual of Qualita tive and Quantitative Analysis with the Blowpipe, translated by Prof. II. B. Cornwall, 1872). The work of Prof. Brush has been freely used in the preparation of the preceding notes upon blowpipe methods and reactions. Determinative Mineralogy. Determinative Mineralogy may be properly considered under the general head of Chemical Mineralogy, since the determination of minerals depends"], [210, "192 chemical mineralogy. mostly upon chemical tests. But crystallographic and all physical characters have also to be used. There is but one satisfactory way in which the identity of an unknown mineral may in all cases be fixed beyond question, and that is by the use of a complete set of determinative tables. By means of such tables the mineral in hand is referred successively from a general group into a more special one, until at last all other species have been eliminated, and the identity of the one given is beyond doubt. A careful preliminary examination of the unknown mineral should, how ever, always be made before final recourse is had to the tables. This examination will often suffice to show what the mineral in hand is, and in any case it, should not be omitted, since it is only in this way that a practi cal familiarity with the appearance and characters of minerals can be gained. The student will naturally take note first, of those characters which are at once obvious to the senses, that is : the color, lustre, feel, general struc ture, fracture, cleavage, and also crystalline form, if distinct ; also, if the specimen is not too small, the apparent weight will suggest something as to the specific gravity. The above characters are of very unequal importance. Structure, if crystals are not present, and fracture are generally unessential except in distinguishing varieties ; color and lustre are essential with metallic, but generally very unimportant with unmetallic minerals. Streak is of importance only7 with colored minerals and those of metallic lustre (p. 158). Crystalline form and cleavage are of the highest importance, but usually require careful study. The first trial should be the determination of the hardness (for which end the pocket-knife is often sufficient in experienced hands). The second trial should be the determination of the specific gravity. Treatment of the powdered mineral witli acids may come next; by this means (see p. 180) the presence of carbonic acid is detected, and also other results obtained (p. 181). Then should follow blowpipe trials, to ascertain the fusibility, the color given to the flame, if any, the character of the sublimate given off, and the reactions with the fluxes and other points as explained in the pre ceding pages. How much the observer learns in the above way, in regard to the nature of his mineral, depends upon his knowledge of the characters of minerals in general, and upon his familiarity with the chemical behavior of the vari ous elementary- substances (pip. 188 to 191) with reagents, and before the blowpipe. If the results of such a preliminary examination are sufficiently definite to suggest that the mineral in hand is one of a small number of species, reference may be made to their full description in Part III. of this work for the final decision. A number of minor tables, embracing under appropriate heads minerals which have some striking physical characters, are added in the Appendix. They will in many cases aid the observer in reaching a conclusion. In addition to these tables, au extended table is also given for the systematic determination of the more important minerals, those described in full in the following pages. The admirable tables of von Kobell, as extended and remodeled by Prof. Brush (Manual of Determinative Mineralogy, see p. 191 ), embracing, as they do, all mineral species, will be found of the greatest value, and should be in the hands of every student."], [211, "PAET III.

The average proportion of gold in the native gold of California, as derived from assays of several hundred millions of dollars' worth, is 880 thousandths ; while the range is mostly between 870 and 800 ( Prof. J. C. Booth, of U. S. Mint). The range in the metal of Australia is mostly between 900 and 960, with an average of 925. The gold of the Chaudiere, Canada, contains usually 10 to 15 p c. of silver ; while that of Nova Scotia is very nearly pure.

Distinguished by its insolubilitj' in nitric acid from pyrite and chalcopyrite. Observations. \u2014 Native gold is found, when in situ, with comparatively small exceptions, in the quartz veins that intersect metamorphic rocks, and to some extent in the wall rock of these veins. The metamorphic rocks thus intersected are mostly chloritic, talcose, and argillaceous schist of dull green, dark gray, and other colors ; also, much less commonly, mica and hornblendic schist, gneiss, dioryte, porphyry ; and still more rarely, granite. A laminated quartzyte, called itacolumyte, is common in many gold regions, as those of Brazil and North Carolina, and sometimes specular schists, or slaty rocks containing much foliated specular iron (hematite), or magnetite in grains. The gold occurs in the quartz in strings, scales, plates, and in masses which are sometimes an agglomeration of crystals ; and the scales are often invisible to the naked eye, massive quartz that apparently contains no gold frequently yielding a considerable percentage to the assay er. It is always very irregularly distributed, and never in continuous pure bands of metal, like many metallic ores. It occurs both disseminated through the mass of the quartz. aud in its cavities. The associated minerals are : pyrite, which far exceeds in quantity all others, and is generally auriferous ; next, chalcopyrite, galenite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, each frequently auriferous ; often tetradymite and other tellurium ores, native bismuth, stib nite, magnetite, hematite ; sometimes barite, apatite, fluorite, siderite, chrysocolla. The gold of the world has been mostly gathered, not directly from the quartz veins, but"], [218, "200 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. from the gravel or sands of rivers or valleys in auriferous regions, or the slopes of mountains or hills, whose rocks contain in some part, and generally not far distant, auriferous veins ; such mines are often called alluvial washings ; in California 'placer-diggings. Most of the gold of the Urals, Brazil, Australia, and all other gold regions, has come from such alluvial wash ings. The alluvial gold is usually in flattened scales of different degrees of fineness, the size depending partly on the original condition in the quartz veins, and partly on the distance to which it has been transported. Transportation by running water is an assorting process ; the coarser particles or largest pieces requiring rapid currents to transport them, and dropping first, and the finer being carried far away \u2014 sometimes scores of miles. A cavity in the rocky slopes or bottom of a valley, or a place where the waters may have eddied, generally proves in such a region to be a pocket full of gold. In the auriferous sands, crystals of zircon are very common ; also garnet and cyanite in grains ; often also monazite, diamonds, topaz, magnetite, corundum, iridosmine, platinum. The zircons are sometimes mistaken for diamonds. Gold exists more or less abundantly over all the continents in most of the regions of crystal line rocks, especially those of the semi-crystalline schists ; and also in some of the large islands of the world where such rocks exist. In Europe, it is most abundant in Hungary and in Transylvania ; it occurs also in the sands of the Rhine, the Reuss, the Aar, the Rhone, and the Danube ; on the southern slope of the Pennine Alps, from the Simplon and Monte Rosa to the valley of Aosta ; in Piedmont ; in Spain, formerly worked in Asturias ; in many of the streams of Cornwall ; near Dolgelly and other parts of North Wales ; in Scotland ; in the county of Wicklow, Ireland ; in Sweden, at Edelfors. In Asia, gold occurs along the eastern flanks of the Urals for 500 miles, and is especially abundant at the Beresov mines near Katharinenburg (lat. 56\u00b0 40' N. ) ; also obtained at Petro pavlovski (60\u00b0 N.) ; Nischne Tagilsk (59\u00b0 N.) ; Miask, near Slatoust and Mt. Ilmen (55\u00b0 N., where the largest Russian nugget was found), etc. Asiatic mines occur also in the Cailas Mountains, in Little Thibet, Ceylon, and Malacca, China, Corea, Japan, Formosa, Sumatra, Java, Horneo, the Philippines, and other East India Islands. In Africa, gold occurs at Kordofan, between Darfour and Abyssinia ; also, south of the Sahara in Western Africa, from the Senegal to Cape Palmas ; in the interior, on the Somat, a day's journey from Cassen ; along the coast opposite Madagascar, between 22\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 S., supposed bj- some to have been the Ophir of the time of Solomon. In South America, gold is found in Brazil ; in New Granada ; Chili ; in Bolivia ; sparingly in Peru. Also in Central America, in Honduras, San Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and near Panama ; most abundant in Honduras. In North America, there are numberless mines along the mountains of Western America, and others along the eastern range of the Appalachians from Alabama and Georgia to Labra dor, besides some indications of gold in portions of the intermediate Archean region about Lake Superior. They occur at many points along the higher regions of the Rocky Mountains, in Mexico, and in New Mexico, in Arizona, in the San Francisco, Wauba, Tuma, and other districts ; in Colorado, abundant, but the gold largely in auriferous pyrite ; in Utah, and Idaho, and Montana. Also along ranges between the summit and the Sierra Nevada, in the Humboldt region and elsewhere. Also in the Sierra Nevada, mostly on its western slope (the mines of the eastern being principally silver mines). The auriferous belt may be said to begin in the Californian peninsula. Near the Tejon pass it enters California, and beyond for 180 miles it is sparingly auriferous, the slate rocks being of small breadth ; but beyond this, northward, the slates increase in extent, and the mines in number and productiveness, and they continue thus for 200 miles or more. Gold occurs also in the Coast ranges in many localities, but mostly in too small quantities to be profitably worked. The regions to the north in Oregon and Washington Territory, and the British Possessions farther north, as also our possessions in Alaska, are at many points auriferous, and productively so, though to a less extent than California. In eastern North America, the mines of the Southern United States produced before the California discoveries, in 1849, about a million of dollars a year. They are mostly confined to the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, or along a line from the Rappahannock to the Coosa in Alabama. But the region may be said to extend north to Canada ; for gold has been found at Albion and Madrid in Maine ; Canaan and Lisbon, N. H. ; Bridgewater, Vermont ; Dedham, Mass. Traces occur also in Franconia township, Mont gomery Co., Pennsylvania. In Canada, gold occurs to the south of the St. Lawrence, in the soil on the Chaudiere, and over a considerable region beyond. In Nova Scotia, mines are worked near Halifax and elsewhere. In Australia, which is fully equal to California in productiveness, and much superior in the purity of the metal, the principal gold mines occur along the streams in the mountains of N. S. Wales (S. E. Australia), and along the continuation of the same range in Victoria (S. Australia)."], [219, "201 NATIVE ELEMENTS. SILVER. Isometric. Cleavage none. Twins : twinning-plane octahedral.

In Russia, it occurs at Nischne Tagilsk, and Goroblagodat, in the Ural, in alluvial material. Formerly used as coins by the Russians. Russia affords annually about 800 cwt. of platinum, which is nearly ten times the amount from Brazil, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo.

Obs, \u2014 The occurrence of masses of native iron of terrestrial origin has been several times reported, but it is not yet placed beyond doubt. The presence of metallic iron in grains in basaltic rocks has been proved by several observers. It has also been noticed in other related rocks. The so-called meteoric iron of Ovifak, Greenland, found imbedded in basalt, is con sidered by some authors to be terrestrial. Meteoric iron usually contains 1 to 20 per cent, of nickel, besides a small percentage of other metals, as cobalt, manganese, tin, copper, chromium ; also phosphorus common as a phosphuret (schreibersite), sulphur in sulphurets, carbon in some instances, chlorine. Among large iron meteorites, the Gibbs meteorite, in the Yale College cabinet, weighs 1,635 lbs. ; it was brought from Red River. The Tucson meteorite, now in the Smithsonian Institution, weighs 1,400 lbs. ; it was originally from Sonora. It is ring-shaped, and is 49 inches in its greatest diameter. Still more remarkable masses exist in northern Mexico ; also in South America ; one was discovered by Don Rubin de Celis in the district of Chaco-Gualamba, whose weight was estimated at 32,000 lbs. The Siberian meteorite, discovered by Pallas, weighed originally 1,600 lbs. and contained imbedded crystals of chrysolite. Smaller masses are quite common. Zinc \u2014 Native zinc has been reported to occur in Australia ; and more recently Mr. W. D. Marks reports its discovery in Tennessee, under circumstances not altogether free from doubt. Lead. \u2014 Native lead occurs very sparingly. It has been found in the Urals, in Spain, Ireland, etc. Dr. Genth speaks of its discovery in the bed rock of the gold placers at Camp Creek, Montana.

Obs \u2014 Sulphur is dimorphous, the crystals being monoclinic when formed at a moderately high temperature (125\" C, according to Frankenheim). The great repositories of sulphur are either beds of gypsum and the associate rocks, or the regions of active and extinct volcanoes. In the valley of Noto and Mazarro, in .Sicily; at Conil, near Cadiz, in Spain ; Bex. in Switzerland ; Cracow, in Poland, it occurs in the former situation ; also Bologna, Italy. Sicily and the neighboring volcanic isles ; the Solfatara, near Naples ; the volcanoes of the Pacific ocean, etc., are localities of the latter kind. Abundant in the Chilian Andes. Sulphur is found near the sulphur sj. rings of New York, Virginia, etc. , sparingly ; in many coal deposits and elsewhere, where pyrite is undergoing decomposition ; at the hot springs and geysers of the Yellowstone park ; in California, at the geysers of Napa valley, Sonoma Co. ; in Santa Barbara in good crystals ; near Clear lake, Lake Co. ; in Nevada, in Humboldt Co., in, large beds ; Nye and Esmeralda Cos., etc. The sulphur mines of Sicily, the crater of Vulcano, the Solfatara near Naples, and the beds of California, afford large quantities of sulphur for commerce.

Var. \u2014 1 . Ordinary, or crystallized. The crystals often contain numerous microscopic cavi ties, as detected by Brewster ; and around these cavities the diamond shows evidence, by polarized light, of compression, as if from pressure in the included gas when the diamond was crystallized.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 Burns, and is wholly consumed at a high temperature, producing carbonic dioxide. It is not acted on by acids or alkalies. Diff. \u2014 Distinguished by its extreme hardness, brilliancy of reflection, and adamantine lustre. Obs. \u2014 The diamond often occurs in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock, called itacolumyte, which pertains to the talcose series, and which in thin slabs is more or less flexible. This rock is found at the mines of Brazil and the Urals ; and also in Georgia and North Carolina, where a few diamonds have been found. It has also been detected in a species of conglomerate, composed of rounded siliceous pebbles, quartz, chalcedony, etc., cemented by a kind of ferruginous clay. Diamonds are usually, however, washed out from the soil. The Ural diamonds occur in the detritus along the Adolfskoi rivulet, where worked for gold, and also at other places. In India the diamond is met with at Purteal, between Hyderabad and Masulipatam, where the famous Kohinoor was found. The locality on Borneo is at Pontiana, on the west side of the Ratoos mountain. Also found in Australia. The diamond region of South Africa, discovered in 1807, is the most productive at the present time. The diamonds occur in the gravel of the Vaal river, from Potchefstrom, cap ital of the Transvaal Republic, down its whole course to its junction with the Orange river, and thence along th_ latter stream for a distance of 60 miles. In addition to this the dia monds are found also in the Orange River Republic, in isolated fields or Pans, of which Du Toit's Pan is the most famous. The number of diamonds which have been found at the Cape is very large, and some of them are of considerable size. It has been estimated that the value of those obtained from March, 1867, to November, 1875, exceeded sixty millions of dollars. As a consequence of this production the market value of the stones has been much dimin ished. In the United States a few crystals have been met, with in Rutherford Co., N. C. , and Hall Co., (ia. ; they occur also at Portis mine, Franklin Co., N. C. (Genth) ; one handsome one, over $ in. in diameter, in the village of Manchester, opposite Richmond, Ya. In California, at Cherokee ravine, in Butte Co. ; also in N. San Juan, Nevada Co. , and elsewhere in the gold washings. Reported from Idaho, and with platinum of Oregon. The largest diamond of which we have any knowledge is mentioned by Tavemier as in possession of the Great Mogul. It weighed originally 900 carats, or 2769 3 grains, but was reduced by cutting to 861 grains. It has the form and size of half a hen's egg. It was found in 1550, in the mine of Colone. The Pitt or Regent diamond weighs but 136 25 carats, or 419J grains ; but is of unblemished transparency and color. It is cut in the form of a bril liant, and its value is estimated at \u00a3125.000. The Kohinoor measured, on its arrival in Eng land, about 1| inches in its greatest diameter, over f of an inch in thickness, and weighed 186-d . carats, and was cut with many facets. It has since been recut, and reduced to a dia meter of I-,1,; by If nearly, and thus diminished over one-third in weight. It is supposed by Mr. Tennant to have been originally a dodecahedron, and he suggests that the great Russian diamond and another large slab weighing 130 carats were actually cut from the original dode cahedron. Tavernier gives the original weight at 787+ carats. The Rajah of Mattan has in his possession a diamond from Borneo, weighing 307 carats.

He inferred that the crystallization was isometric from some associated crystals, and so published it. This led von Waltershausen and Heusser to call the isometric mineral dufrenoysite, and the latter to na ne the orthorhombic species binnite. Yon Waltershausen, after studying the prismatic mineral, made out of the species arsenomelan and scleroclase, yet partly on hypothetical grounds. Recently it has been found that three ortho rhombic minerals exist at the locality, as announced by vom Rath, who identifies one, by speci fic gravity and composition, with Damour's dufrenoysite ; another he makes scleroclase of von Waltershausen (sartorite, p. 228) ; and the other he names jordanite (p. 229).

The mineral was first described by Knop, and though his description of the crystals does not agree with that given above, there seems to be no doubt that the material was the same, which has since been investigated by Hagemann (dimetric pachnolite \u2014.thomsenolite), Wohler (pyroconite) and K\u0153nig, as urged by the latter. Knop originally described two varieties of the mineral, to which be gave the name pachno lite. The variety, A, appeared in large, cuboidal crystals, with cleavage planes parallel to the faces, intersecting at angles of approximately 903. These cleavage planes seemed to be con tinued on into the mass of the cryolite on which the crystals were implanted. The second variety, B. was in small brilliant crystals, of prismatic form, grouped together often in par allel position upon the cryolite (hence the name, from tt_x>\"!, frost).

There are three"], [264, "246 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. subdivisions of the species prominently recognized in the arts, and until early in this century regarded as distinct species ; but which actually differ only in purity and state of crystalliza tion or structure. Var. 1. Sapphire \u2014 Includes the purer kinds of fine colors, transparent to translucent, useful as gems. Stones are named according to their colors ; true Ruby, or Oriental Ruby, red ; 0 Topas, yellow ; 0. Emerald, green ; 0. Amethyst, purple. 2. Corundum. \u2014 Includes the kinds of dark or dull colors and not transparent, colors light blue to gray, brown, and black. The original adamantine spar from India has a dark gray ish smoky-brown tint, but greenish or bluish by transmitted light, when translucent, and either in distinct crystals often large, or cleavable-massive. It is ground and used as a polish ing material, and being purer, is superior in this respect to emery. It was thus employed in ancient times, both in India and Europe. 3. Emery, Schmirgel, Germ. \u2014 Includes granular corundum, of black or grayish-black color, and contains magnetite or hematite intimately mixed. Feels and looks much like a black fine-grained iron ore. which it was long considered to be. There are gradations from the evenly fine-grained emery to kinds in which the corundum is in distinct crystals. This last is the case with part of that at Chester, Massachusetts. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. unaltered ; slowly dissolved in borax and salt of phosphorus to a clear glass, which is colorless when free from iron ; not acted upon by soda. The finely pulverized mineral, after heating with cobalt solution, gives a beautiful blue color. Not acted upon by acids, but converted into a soluble compound by fusion with potassium bisulphate or soda. Friction excites electricity, and in polished specimens the electrical attraction con tinues for a considerable length of time. Diff. \u2014 Distinguished by its hardness, scratching quartz and topaz ; its infusibility and its high specific gravity. Obs. \u2014 This species is associated with crystalline rocks, as granular limestone or dolomite, gneiss, granite, mica slate, chlorite slate. The fine sapphires are usually obtained from the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of magnetic iron ore, and several species of gems. The emery of Asia Minor, according to Dr. Smith, occurs in granular limestone. Sapphires occur in Ceylon ; the East Indies ; China, Corundum, at St. Gothard ; in Pied mont ; Urals ; Bohemia. Emery is found in large boulders on some of the Grecian islands ; also in Asia Minor, near Ephesus, etc. In N. America, in Massachusetts, at Chester, corun dum and emery in a large vein; also in Westchester Co., N. Y. In New York, at Warwick and Amity. In Pennsylvania, in Delaware Co., and Chester Co. In western N. Carolina, at many localities in large quantities, and sometimes in crystals of immense size. In Georgia, in Cherokee Co.

The varieties depend on texture or state of aggregation, and in some cases the presence of impurities. Var. 1. Specular. Lustre metallic, and crystals often splendent, whence the name specular iron, (b) When the structure is foliated or micaceous, the ore is called micaceous hematite (Eisenglimmer). 2. Compact columnar ; or fibrous. The masses of ten long radiating ; lustre submetallic to metallic ; color brownish-red to iron-black. Sometimes called r. d hematite, the name hematite among the older mineralogists including the fibrous, stalactitic, and other solid massive varieties of this species, limonite, and turgite. 3. Red Oclireous. Red and earthy. Often specimens of the preceding are red ochreous on some parts. Reddle and nd chalk are red ochre, mixed with more or less clay. 4. Clay Iron-stone ; Argillaceous hematite. Hard, brownish-black to reddish-brown, heavy stone ; often in part deep-red ; of submetallic to unmetallic lustre ; and affording, like all the preceding, a red streak. It consists of iron sesquioxide with clay or sand, and sometimes other impurities. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. infusible; on charcoal in R.F. becomes magnetic ; with borax in O.F. gives a bead, which is yellow while hot and colorless on cooling ; if saturated, the bead appears red while hot and yellow on cooling ; in R.F. gives a bottle-green color, and if treated on charcoal with metallic tin, assumes a vitriol-green color. With soda on charcoal in R.F. is reduced to a gray magnetic metallic powder. Soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Diff. \u2014 Distinguished from magnetite by its red streak, also from limonite by the same means, as well as by its not containing water ; from turgite by its greater hardness and by its not decrepitating B.B. It is hard; and infusible. Obs \u2014 This ore occurs in rocks of all ages. The specular variety is mostly confined to crys talline or metamorphic rocks, but is also a result of igneous action about some volcanoes, as at Vesuvius. Traversella in Piedmont ; the island of Elba, afford fine specimens ; also St. Gothard, often in the form of rosettes (Eisenrose-, and Cavradi in Tavetsch ; and near Limoges, France. At Etna and Vesuvius it is the result of volcanic action. Arendal in Norway, Long ban in Sweden, Framont in Lorraine, Dauphiny, also Cleator Moor in Cumberland, are other localities. In N. America, widely distributed, and sometimes in beds of vast thickness in rocks of the Arch\u00e6an age. as in the Marquette region in northern Michigan ; and in Missouri, at the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mtn. ; in Arizona and New Mexico. Some of the localities, interesting for their specimens, are in northern New York, etc.; Woodstock and Aroostook, Me.; at Hawley, Mass. ; at Piermont, N. H. This ore affords a considerable portion of the iron manufactured in different countries. The varieties, especially the specular, require a greater degree of heat to melt than other ores, but the iron obtained is of good quality. Pulverized red hematite is employed in polishing metals, and also as a coloring material. The fine-grained massive variety from England (bloodstone), showing often beautiful conchoidal fracture, is much used for burnishing metals. Red ochre is valuable in making paint. Martite is iron sesquioxide under an isometric form, occurring in octahedrons or dodeca- hedrons like magnetite, and supposed to be pseudomorphous, mostly after magnetite. H. = 6-7. G. =4*809-4*832, Brazil, Breith. ; 5*33, Monroe, N. Y., Hunt. Lustre submetallic. Color iron-black, sometimes with a bronzed tarnish. Streak reddish-brown or purplish-brown. Fracture conchoidal. Not magnetic, or only feebly so. The crystals are sometimes imbed- ded in the massive sesquioxide. They are distinguished from magnetite by their red streak, and very feeble, if any, action on the magnetic needle. Found in Vermont at Chittenden; in the Marquette iron region south of L. Superior; Bass lake, Canada West ; Digby Neck, Nova Scotia ; at Monroe, N. Y. ; in Moravia, near Schonberg, in granite. MENACCANITE. Ilmenite. Titanic Iron Ore. Titaneisen, Germ.

Comp., Var (Ti,Fe).03 (or hematite, with part of the iron replaced by titanium), the pro portion of Ti to Fe varying. Mosander assumes the proportion of FeO : TiO\u00bb to be always 1:1, and that in addition variable amounts of Fe03 are present in the different varieties. The extensive investigations of Rammelsberg have led him to write the formula like Mosan der (FeO,TiO.)+nFe03 (notice here that FeO,TiO_.=R03). This method has the advantage of explaining the presence of the magnesium, occurring sometimes in considerable amount, it replacing the iron ( FeO ). The first formula given requires the assumption of Mg_03. Friedel and Gutrin have recently discussed the same subject (Ann. Ch. Phys., V. , viii., 38, 1876). Sometimes contains manganese. The varieties recognized arise mainly from the proportions of iron to titanium. No satisfactory external distinctions have yet been made out.

Also at Magnet Cove, Arkansas. DesCloizeaux has found that the yellow crystals from Zermatt have a complex twinned structure, and are optically biaxial. Kokscharof, in his latest investigations, has shown that the Russian specimens also exhibit phenomena in polarized light analogous to those of biaxial crystals, though irregular. He proves, however, that crystallographically the crystals ex amined by him were unquestionably isometric, and adds also that almost all the Russian perofskite crystals are penetration -twins. The latter fact explains the commonly observed striations on the cubic planes, as also the incompleteness in the development of the other forms. He refers the optical irregularities to the want of homogeneity in the crystals.

Flint-like, massive, or cryp tocrystalline. The first division includes all ordinary vitreous quartz, whether having crys talline faces or not. The, varieties under the second are in general acted upon somewhat more by attrition, and by chemical agents, as fluohydric acid, than those of the first. In all kinds made up of layers, as agate, successive layers are.unequally eroded. A. Phenocrystalline or Vitreous Varieties. 1. Ordinary Crystallized ; Rock Crystal. Colorless quartz, or nearly so, whether in dis tinct crystals or not. 2. Aster iated ; Star quartz (Sternquartz, Germ.). Containing within the crystal whitish or colored radiations along the diametral planes. 3. Amethystine ; Amethyst. Clear purple, or bluish-violet. The color is supposed to be due to manganese. 4. Rose. Rose-red or pink, but becoming paler on exposure. Common massive, and then usually much cracked. Lustre sometimes a little greasy. Fuchs states that the color is dne to titanic oxide. It may come in part from manganese. 5. Yellow ; False Topaz. Yellow and pellucid, or nearly so ; resembling somewhat yellow topaz, but very different in crystallization and in absence of cleavage. 6. Smoky, Cairngorm Stone. Smoky -yellow to smoky-brown, and often transparent ; hut varying to brownish-black, and then nearly opaque in thick crystals. The color is due to organic compounds, according to Forster. 7. Milky. Milk-white and nearly opaque. Lustre often greasy, and then called Greasy quartz. 8. Cat's Eye (Katzenauge, Germ.). Exhibiting opalescence, but without prismatic colors, an effect due to fibres of asbestus. 9. Aventurine. Spangled with scales of mica or other mineral. 10. Impure from the presence of distinct minerals distributed densely through the mass. The more common kinds are those in which the impurities are : (a) ferruginous, either red or yellow iron oxide ; (4) chloritic, some kind of chlorite ; (c) actinolitic ; (d) micaceous ; (.) are naceous, or sand. Quartz crystals also occur penetrated by various minerals, as topaz, corun dum, chrysoberyl, garnet, different species of the hornblende and pyroxene groups, rutile, hematite, gothite, etc., etc. Containing liquids in cavities. These liquids are seen to move with the change of position of the crystal, provided an air-bubble be present in the cavity. The liquid is either water (pure, or a mineral solution), carbon dioxide, or some petroleum-like or other compound. B. Cryptocrystalline Varieties. 1. Chalcedony. Having the lustre nearly of wax. and either transparent or translucent Color white, grayish, pale-brown to dark-brown, black ; tendon-color common ; sometimes deli cate blue. Also of other shades, and then having other names. Often mammillary, botryoi dal, stalactitic, and occurring lining or filling cavities in rocks. It is true quartz, with some disseminated opal. 2. Cai-nelian. A clear red chalcedony, pale to deep in shade ; also brownish-red to brown, the latter kind reddish-brown by transmitted light. 3. Chrysoprase. An apple-green chalcedony, the color due to the presence of nickel oxide. 4. Prase. Translucent and dull leek-green ; so named from irpaaov, a leek. Always regarded as a stone of little value. The name is also given to crystalline quartz of the same color. 5. Plasma. Rather bright-green to leek-green, and also sometimes nearly emerald-green, and subtranslucent or feebly translucent ; sometimes dotted with white. Heliotrope, or Blood-stone, is the same stone essentially, with small spots of red jasper, looking like drops of blood. 6. Agate. A variegated chalcedony. The colors are either banded or in clouds, or due to visible impurities, a. Banded. The bands are delicate parallel lines, of white, tendon-like, wax-like, pale and dark-brown, and black colors, and sometimes bluish and other shades. They follow waving or zigzag courses, and are occasionally concentric circular, as in the eye agate. The bands are the edges of layers of deposition, the agate having been formed by a deposit of silica from solutions intermittently supplied, in irregular cavities in rocks, and"], [283, "265 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS \u2014 SILICA. deriving their concentric waving courses from the irregularities of the walls of the cavity. Owing also to the unequal porosity, agates may be varied in color by artificial means. /.. Ir regularly clouded. The colors various, as iu banded agate, y. Colors due to visible impurities, including Moss-agate, filled with brown moss-like or dendritic forms distributed through the mass ; Dendritic Agate, containing brown or black dendritic markings. There is also Agatized wood : wood petrified with clouded agate. 7. Onyx. Like agate in consisting of layers of different colors, but the layers are in even planes, and the banding therefore straight, \u00aband hence its use for cameos, the head being cut in one color, and another serving for the background. The colors of the best are perfectly well defined, and either white and black, or white, brown and black alternate. 8. Sardonyx. Like onyx in structure, but includes layers of carnelian (sard) along with others of white or whitish, and brown, and sometimes black colors. 9. Jasper. Impure opaque colored quartz, (a) Red iron sesquioxide being the coloring matter, (b) Brownish, or ochre-yellow, colored by hydrous iron sesquioxide, and becoming red when so heated as to drive off the water, (c) Dark-green and brownish-green, (d ) Grayish blue, (e) Blackish or brownish-black. (/) Striped or riband jasper (Bandjaspis, Germ.), having the colors in broad stripes, (g) Egyptian jasper, in nodules which are zoned in brown and yellowish colors. Porcelain jasper is nothing but baked clay, and differs from true jasper in being B.B. fusible on the edges. Red porphyry, or its base, resembles jasper, but is also fusible on the edges, being usually an impure feldspar. 10. Agate-Jasper. An agate consisting of jasper with veinings and cloudings of chalcedony. 11. Siliceous sinter. Irregularly cellular quartz, formed by deposition from waters contain ing silica or soluble silicates in solution. 12. Flint (Feuerstein, Germ. ). Somewhat allied to chalcedony, but more opaque, and of dull colors, usually gray, smoky-brown, and brownish-black. The exterior is often whitish, from mixture with lime or chalk, in which it is imbedded. Lustre barely glistening, sub vitreous. Breaks with a deeply conchoidal fracture, and a sharp cutting edge. The flint of the chalk formation consists largely of the remains of infusoria (Diatoms), sponges, and other marine productions. The coloring matter of the common kinds is mostly carbonaceous matter. 13. Hornstone Germ.). Resembles flint, but more brittle, the fracture more splintery. Chert is a term often applied to hornstone, and to any impure flinty rock, includ ing the jaspers. 14. Basanite, Lydian Stone or Touchstone. A velvet-black siliceous stone or flinty jasper, used on account of its hardness an* I black color for trying the purity of the precious metals. The color left on the stone after rubbing the metal across it indicates to the experienced eye the amount of alloy. It is not splintery like hornstone. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. unaltered; with borax dissolves slowly to a clear glass; with soda dis- solves with effervescence ; unacted upon by salt of phosphorus. Insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and only slightly acted upon by solutions of fixed caustic alkalies. When fused and cooled it becomes opal-silica, having G. =2*2. Diff. \u2014 Quartz is distinguished by its hardness \u2014 scratching glass with facility ; infusibility \u2014 not fusing before the blowpipe ; insolubility \u2014 not attacked by water or the acids ; uncleavi- bility \u2014 one variety being tabular, but proper cleavage never being distinctly observed. To these characteristics the action of soda B. B. may be added. Obs. \u2014 Quartz occurs as one of the essential constituents of granite, syenite, gneiss, mica schist, and many related rocks ; as the principal constituent of quartz-rock and many sand- stones ; as an unessential ingredient in some trachyte, porphyry, etc. ; as the vein-stone in various rocks, and for a large part of mineral veins ; as a foreign mineral in the cavities of trap, basalt, and related rocks, some limestones, etc. , making geodes of crystals, or of chalcedony, agate, carnelian, etc.; as imbedded nodules or masses in various limestones, constituting the flint of the chalk formation, the hornstone of other limestones \u2014 these nodules sometimes becoming continuous layers ; as masses of jasper occasionally in limestone. It is the principal material of the pebbles of gravel beds, and of the sands of the sea-shore and sand beds every- where. Silica also occurs in solution (but mostly as a soluble alkaline silicate) in heated natural waters, as those of the Geysers of Iceland, New Zealand, and California, and the Yellowstone Park, and very sparingly in many cold mineral waters. Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries, and numerous other foreign locali- ties, afford fine specimens of rock crystal. Amethysts are brought from India, Ceylon, and Persia, also Transylvania. The amygdaloids of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, afford magni ficent specimens of chalcedony ; also Hiittenberg and Lo ben in Carinthia, etc. The finest carnelians and agates are found in Arabia, India. Brazil, Surinam, Oberstein, and Saxony. Cat's eye, in Ceylon, the coast of Malabar, and also in the Harz and Bavaiia. Heliotrope, in Bucharia, Tartary, Siberia."], [284, "266 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY.

Heliotrope occupies veins in slate at Bloomingrove, Orange Co. , N. Y. Several varieties of this species have long been employed in jewelry. The amethyst has always been esteemed for its beauty. Cameos are in general made of onyx, which is well fitted for this kind of miniature sculpture. Jasper admits of a brilliant polish, and is often formed into vases, boxes, knife-handles, etc. It is also extensively used in the manufacture of Florentine mosaics. The carnelian is often rich in color, but is too common to be much esteemed ; when first obtained from the rock they are usually gray or grayish-red ; they receive their fine colors from an exposure of several weeks to the sun's rays, and a subsequent heating in earthen pots. The colors of agate, when indistinct, may be brought out by boil ing in oil, and afterward in sulphuric acid ; the latter carbonizes the oil absorbed by the porous layers, and thus increases the contrast of the different colors.

Comp., Var. \u2014 A bisilicate, having the general formula RSi03, where R may be Ca,Mg, Fe.Mn, sometimes also Zn,Ka3,Na_. Usually two or more of these bases are present. The first three are most common ; but calcium is the only one that is present always and in large percentage. Besides the substitutions of the above bases for one another, these same bases are at times replaced by Al,Pe,Mn, though sparingly, and the silicon occasionally by alumi- num. The varieties proceeding from these isomorphous substitutions are many and diverse ; and there are still others depending on the state of crystallization. The foliated and fibrous kinds early received separate names, and for a while were regarded as distinct species. Fibrous or columnar forms are very much less common than in hornblende, and lamellar or foliated kinds more common. The crystals are rarely long and slender, or bladed, like those of that species. The most prominent division of the species is into (A) the non-aluminous ; (B) the alumi nous. But the former of these groups shades imperceptibly into the latter. These two groups are generally subdivided according to the prevalence of the different protoxide elements. Yet here, also, the gradation from one series to another is in general by almost insensible shades as to composition and chemical characters, as well as all physical qualities. I.

Fibrous and columnar forms are much more common than with pyroxene, lamellar and foliated forms rare. Crystals often long, slender, or bladed. Differs from the fibrous zeolites in not gelatinizing with acids. humorphous and Dimorphous relations to Pyroxene. \u2014 The analogy in composition between pyroxene and hornblende has been abundantly illustrated. They have the same general formula ; and under this formula there is but one difference of any importance, viz. , that lime is a prominent mgredient in all the varieties of pyroxene, while it is wanting, or nearly so, in some of those of hornblende. The analogy between the two species in crystallization. or their essential isomorphism, was pointed out by G. Rose in 1831, who showed that the forms of both were referable to one and the same fundamental form. The prism /of horn blende corresponds in angle to i-2 of pyroxene. Calculating from the angle I A Ira pyroxene, 87 J 5', the angle of i-2 is precisely 124 ** 30 , or the angle / /in hornblende. But while thus isomorphous in axial relations or form, they are also dimorphous. For (1) the cleavage in pyroxene is parallel to the prism of 87\u00b0 5', and in hornblende to that of 124A\\ (2) The occur ring secondary planes of the latter are in general diverse from those of the former, so that the crystals differ strikingly in habit or system of modifications. Moreover, in pyroxene colum nar and fine fibrous forms are uncommon ; in hornblende, exceedingly common. (3) The several chemical compounds under pyroxene have one-tenth higher specific gravity than the corresponding ones under hornblende. Vom Rath has described the occurrence of minute crystals of hornblende in parallel posi tion upon crystals of pyroxene (Vesuvius), and in consequence of the relation between the two forms, thus brought out, suggests a change in the commonly accepted fundamental form of the latter. (Jahrb. Min., 1876.) This association of crystals of the two species in parallel position is not uncommon. Obs. \u2014 Amphibole occurs in many crystalline limestones, and metamorphic granitic and schistose rocks, and sparingly in serpentine, and volcanic or igneous rocks. Tremolite, the magnesia-lime variety, is especially common in limestones, particularly magnesian or dolomi tic ; actinolite, the magnesia-lime-iron variety, in steatitic rocks ; and brown, dark-green, and black hornblende, in chlorite schists, mica schist, gneiss, and in various other rocks (syenyte, dioryte, etc.), of which it forms a constituent part. Asbestus is often found in con nection with serpentine. Hornblende is often disseminated in black prismatic crystals through trachyte, and also through other igneous rocks, especially the feldspathic kinds.

There are, however, two prominent groups depend- ent on color, the color varying as chrome or iron is present ; but only the merest trace of either exists in any case. The crystals are usually oblong prisms. 1. Emerald. Color bright emerald-green, owing to the presence of chromium. Hardness a little less than for beryl, according to the lapidaries. 2. Beryl. Colors those of the species, excepting emerald-green, and due mainly to iron. The varieties of beryl depending on color are of importance in the arts, when the crystals are transparent enough to be of value as gems. The transparent bluish-green kinds are called aquamarine ; also apple -green ; greenish-yellow to iron-yel- low and honey-yellow.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Garnet is a unisilicate of elements in the sesquioxide and protoxide states, having the general formula R3RSi30i2. There are three prominent groups, based on the nature of the predominating sesquioxide. I. Alumina garnet, in which aluminum (Al) predominates. II. Iron gabnet, in which iron (Fe) predominates, usually with some aluminum. 111. Chrome garnet in which chromium (6r) is most prominent. There are the following varieties or subspecies, based on the predominance of one or another of the protoxides : A. Grossclarite, or Lime-Alumina garnet. B. Pvrope, or Magnesia- Alumina garnet. C. Almandite, or Iron- Alumina garnet. D. Spessartite, or Manganese-Alumina garnet. E. AndradIte, or Lime-Iron garnet, including 1, ordinary; 2, manganesian, or Bothoffite ; 3, yttriferous, or Yttcr-garnet. F. Bredbergite, or Lime-Magnesia-Iron, garnet. G.

It is a constituent in the nephelin-doleryte of Merches in the Vogelsberg ; abundant in trachyte between Lake Laach and Andernach, on the Rhine. The question as to whether the crystals of leucite belong to the isometric or the tetragonal system has excited much discussion. Hirschwald (Tsch. Mm Mitth., 1875, 227) shows that while implanted crystals are sometimes distinctly tetragonal, others, especially those which are imbedded, are as clearly isometric, while between the two there exist many transition cases. He claims that the mineral is in fact isometric, but having a polysymmetric develop ment, there existing a wide variation from the isometric type. The question cannot be con sidered as entirely decided."], [315, "OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. \u2014 ANHYDROUS SILICATES. 297 Feldspar Gro up. The feldspars are characterized by specific gravity below 2*85 ; hardness 6 to 7 ; fusibility 3 to 5 ; oblique or clinohedral crystallization ; prismatic angle near 120\u00b0 ; two easy cleavages, one basal, the other brachydiagonal, inclined together either 90\u00b0, or very near 90\u00b0 ; cleavage a prominent fea- ture of many massive kinds, and distinct in the grains of granular varieties, giving them angular forms ; close isomorphism, and a general resemblance in the systems of occurring crystalline forms ; transition from granular varieties to compact, hornstone-like kinds, called felsites, which sometimes occur as rocks ; often opalescent, or having a play of colors as seen in a direction a little oblique to i-i; often aventurine, from the dissemination of microscopic crystals of foreign substances parallel for the most part to the planes O and I. The bases in the protoxide state are calcium, sodium, potassium, and in one species barium ; the sesquioxide base is only aluminum ; the quantivalent ratio of R : R is constant, 1:3; while that of the silicon and bases varies from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1, the amount of silicon increasing with the increase of the alkali metals, and becoming greatest when alkalies are the only protoxides.

The above ratios are only approximate, for the analyses show a wide variation in the amount of silicon, and an exactly proportionate variation in the amount of alkali ; the two elements vary in most cases, as has been long recognized, according to a simple law. There seems hence to be a gradual transition between the successive species ; but this is due, in part, to mixtures produced by contemporaneous crystallization (compare pert/lite, p. 000, and the description of microcline, p. 000). The unisilicate ratio of 1 : 1 for bases and silicon is found in anorthite only, as shown above. With Ca alone, as in this species, the Q. ratio for Al and Si is 3 : 4 ; with Na2 alone, 3 : 12; and for kinds containing combinations of the two, exact combinations of these ratios, \u00bbiSa. : \u201e 4'\u00ab+12\u00bb stCa, giving the ratio 3 : ' \u00b0 B m+n An explanation of the above fact, and of the variation in ratio shown by analyses, was offered by Hunt, and has since been developed by Tschermak. The existence of two distinct triclinic feldspars is assumed: anorthite CaAlSi.O., and albite Na.AlSi.O,., and the other species (sometimes embraced under the general term plagioclase) are regarded as due to isomor phous mixtures of these two members in different proportions. They have then the general formula . m{Sa Y's1',?8 '\u2022 For labradorite the ratio of m : n is mostly 3 : 2, also 3 : 1, etc.; ' rt,(Na.jAlSi\u00abOi6) . for andesite the ratio of in : n varies about 1 : 2, and for oligoclase the ratio of m : n is 3 : 10, also 1 \u2022 3 etc In accordance with the above formula, if Ca : Na=6 : 1, then Al : Si= 1 : 2-308 * for ' Ca : Na=3 : 1, Al : Si=l : 1 *257 ; for Ca : Na=l : 1, Al : Si=l : 3*33 ; for Ca : Na=l : 3, Al : Si=l : 4*4 ; for Ca : Na=i : 6, Al : Si=l : 5. This method of viewing the feldspar species has the advantage of explaining the wide varia tion in their composition, and is generally accepted among German mineralogists. DesCloi zeaux regards his observations upon the optical characters of the feldspars (see p. 298) as showino- that they are in fact distinct species, and not indeterminate isomorphous mixtures."], [316, "298 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Optical properties of the triclinic feldspars. \u2014 The following table contains the more import ant optical properties of the feldspar species as determined by DesCloizeaux (C. R., Feb. 8, 1875, and April 17, 1876). Bx=Bisectrix. The axial divergence is quite constant for albite, labradorite, and anorthite, but varies for oligoclase even in different sections taken from the same specimen. Andesine (q. v. ) is regarded by DesCloizeaux as an altered oligoclase. DesCloizeaux gives the following method of distinguishing between the feldspars by optical means : It is necessary to obtain a transparent plate parallel to the easiest cleavage ( 0). Such sections obtained from crystals or lamellar masses of albite, oligoclase, labradorite, and the majority of those of microchne, show hemitropic bands, more or less close together, arranged along the plane parallel to the second cleavage (i-i) ; for orthoclase and microline in simple crystals, two sections placed in opposite positions serve to produce the same effect. These sections are thus brought between the crossed Nicols of a polarization-microscope. (1) For orthoclase the maximum extinction takes place when the two sections are parallel to their plane of contact ; the edge 0 i-i being in the plane of polarization of the micro scope. (2) For microcline, tho whole structure consists of a multitude of very fine parallel bands; the section may show microcline alone, either hemitropic or not hemitropic, or microcline and orthoclase ; the extinction can take place at 30 54' between the adjoining bands of the same plate of the made (microcline alone), at 30\u00b0 54' between the two plates of the made (micro cline in bands), or at 15 27' between the adjoining bands (microcline and orthoclase). In the last case the whole of two lamell\u00e6 of the made show at the same time an extinction oblique to the plane of composition, belonging to the microcline, and one parallel to this plane for the orthoclase. (3) For albite, the extinction between two bands takes place at an angle of 6\u00b0 32'. (4) For oligoclase, the extinction is simultaneous in the two bands, and when the plane of composition coincides with the plane of polarization of the polariscope, it shows that the structure is homogeneous. (5) For labradorite, the extinction takes place at 10\u00b0 24' between the alternate lines of the hemitropic lamell\u00e6. It follows from this that a plane normal to the plane of the axes cuts the base along a line making with the edge 0/ i-i the following angles : 0\" in orthoclase, 15\" 27' in microcline, 3\u00b0 10' in albite, 5\u00b0 12 in labradorite. A variation of one or two degrees from the above mean angles was observed in some specimens.

Diff. \u2014 The feldspars are distinguished from other species by the characters already stated, prominent among which are : cleavage in two directions, nearly or quite at right angles to each other ; also hardness, etc. The triclinic feldspars can in most cases be distinguished from orthoclase by the fine stria tion due to repeated twinning. This striation can often be seen by the unaided eye upon the cleavage face (0). And its existence can always be surely tested by the examination of a thin section in polarized light, the alternate bands of color showing the same fact. The separation of the different triclinic species can be surely made by complete analysis only, or at least by the determination of the amount of alkali present. The degree of fusi bility, the color of the flame, and the effect produced by digestion in acids, are often import ant aids. In the hands of a skilled observer the optical examination may give decisive results. ANORTHITE. Indianite. Triclinic. c : b : a = 0-S6663 : 1-57548 : 1.

By cutting very thin slices, parallel to .-., from the original labradorite, they are seen under the microscope to contain, besides stri\u00e6, great numbers of minute scales, like the aventurine oligoclase, which are probably gothite or hema tite. These scales produce an aventurine effect which is quite independent of the play of colors which arises from the interference of the rays of light reflected by innumerable inter nal lamell\u00e6 (Reusch). The various forms of minerals (micropbikites, microphyllites, etc.) en closed in the labradorite, and their relation to it in position, have been thoroughly investigated by Schrauf (Ber.

Obs\u2014 Labradorite is a constituent of some rocks, both metamorphic and igneous; e.g., diabase, doleryte, basalt, etc. The labradoritic metamorphic rocks are most common among the formations of the Arch\u00e6an or pre-Silurian era. Such are part of those of British America, northern New York, Pennsylvania, Arkansas; those of Greenland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, aud probably of the Vosges. Being a feldspar containing comparatively little silica, it occurs mainly in rocks which include little or no quartz (free silica). Kiew has furnished fine specimens ; also Labrador. It is met with in many places in Canada Bast. Occurs at Essex Co., N. Y. ; also in St. Lawrence, Warren, Scoharie, and Green Cos. In Pennsylvania, at Mineral Hili, Chester Co. ; in the Witchita Mts., Arkansas, etc. , . Labradorite was first brought from the Isle of Paul, on the coast of Labrador, by Mr. Wolfe, a Moravian missionary, about the year 1770, and was called by the early mineralogists Labra dor stone (Labradorstein), and also chatoyant, opaline, or Labrador feldspar. Labradorite receives a fine polish, and owing to the chatjyant reflections, the specimens are often highly beautiful. It is sometimes used in jewelry.

York, at Rossie ; in the town of Hammond ; in Lewis Co. ; near Natural Bridge ; in Warwick ; and at Amity and Edenville. In Penn., in crystals at Leiperville, Delaware Co., etc. In N. Car., at Washington Mine, Davidson Co. ; beautiful Amazonstone at Pike's Peak, Col. Massive ortho clase is abundant at many localities. Microcline. A triclinic potash feldspar. \u2014 The name microcline was origin ally given by Breithaupt to a whitish or reddish feldspar from the zircon-syenite of Fredericksviirn and Brevig. Norway, on the ground that it was triclinic. It was shown by DesCloizeaux that this feldspar was merely a variety of orthoclase remarkable for its large amount of soda. Recently the latter author has proposed to retain this name for a feldspar found in the midst of gran ites, pegmatite, and gneiss, which is shown both by the angle between its cleavage planes, and also by its optical properties, to be really triclinic. Form generally like that of orthoclase. Cleavage basal and clinodiagonal, and also easy parallel to both prismatic faces (1 and _\") ; for the optical properties see p. 298. Often asso ciated with orthoclase in regular parallel bands, especially in the amazonstone ; albite is also sometimes present, though irregularly.

The purest microcline was that of a greenish color from Magnet Cove, Ark. ; it enclosed crystals of \u00e6girite, and was not mixed with orthoclase. Subsilicates. Humite or Chondrodite Group, including three sub-species: I. Humite ; II. Chondrodite ; III. Clinohumite. The existence of three types of forms among the crystals of humite (Vesuvius) was early shown by Scacchi ; they have since then been further investigated by vom Rath (Pogg. Erg.,"], [323, "305 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS ANHYDROUS SILICATES. Bd. v., 321, 1871 ; ibid., vi., 385, 1873). The chemical identity of the species humite and chondrodite was shown by Rammelsberg ; later Kokscharof proved that the crystals of chon drodite from Pargas, Finland, were identical in form and angles with Scacchi's type II, of humite, and the same has also been shown of the Swedish crystals by vom Rath. In 1875 the author described crystals of chondrodite from Brewster, N. Y. , belonging to each of the three types of humite ; he showed, moreover, then and later (Feb., 1876), that contrary to what had been previously assumed, the crystals of both type II. and type III. were monoclinic, not orthorhombic. DesCloizeaux and Klein have since proved (Jahrb. Min., 1876, No. 6) the monoclinic character of type III. of the Vesuvian humite, and the former that of the Swedish crystals (type II.) ; he, moreover, proved the orthorhombic character of the crystals of type I. , Vesuvius. In accordance with these facts DesCloizeaux has proposed that the three types be regarded as distinct species, with the names given above. I. HUMITE. Including type I. , Scacchi, Vesuvius.

Comp. \u2014 Q. ratio of all varieties for R : Si=3 : 2 (Rammelsberg), consequently the general ii i * i ii formula is R3(Re,R)Si05. R may represent here H, K, Na, Li ; also R=Mg(Ca).Fe,Mn, and ft=Al,B. ; further than this the Si is often in part replaced by F2. Rammelsberg distin guishes two groups, where the Q. ratio for B : Al : Si=3 : 6 : 8, and (2) with the Q. ratio for B : Al : Si = l : 3 : 3. In the first group fall most of the yellow, brown, and black varieties, ii i the bivalent elements (Mg,Fe) predominating, the general formula being R3(R6)R:,Sij.O\u00bbo. The second group includes the colorless, red, and slightly green kinds, the univalent elements i ii appearing most prominent, especially lithium. The general formula is RefRaJfisSiuO^.

With the fluxes many varieties give reactions for iron and manganese. Fused with a mixture of potassium bisulphate and fluorite gives a strong reaction for boracie acid. By heat alone tourmaline loses weight from the evolution of silicon fluoride and per haps also boron fluoride ; and only after previous ignition is the mineral completely decom posed by fluohydric acid. Not decomposed by acids (Ramm. ). After fusion perfectly decom posed by sulphuric acid (v. Kobell).

In North America, at Bergen Hill, New Jersey ; at the Michipicoten Islands, Lake Superior ; Nova Scotia, etc. The name stilbite is from a-i/.jJn, lustre; and desmine from fila/nj, a bundle. The species stilbite, as adopted by Haiiy, included Strahlzeolith Wern. (radiated zeolite, or the above), and Bliitterzeolith Wern. (foliated zeolite, or the species heulandite beyond). The former was the typical part of the species, and is the first mentioned in the description ; and the latter he added to the species, as he observes, with much hesitation. In 1817, Breithaupt separated the two zeolites, and called the former desmine and the latter euzeolite, thus throwing aside entirely, contrary to rule and propriety, Haiiy's name stilbite, which should have been accepted by him in place of desmine, it being the typical part of his species. In 1822, Brooke (ap parently unaware of what Breithaupt had done) used stilbite for the first, and named the other heulandiU.

But as chrysolite is especially liable to the change to serpen tine, and chrysolite is a unisilicate, and the change consists in a loss of some Mg. and the addition of water, it is probable that part of the water takes the place of the lost Mg, so that the mineral is essentially a hydrated chrysolite of the formula H..Mg_SioO\u201e + aq.

Being a result of alteration, and amorphous, the mineral varies much in composition, and numerous species have been made of the mineral in its various conditions. The varieties of pinite here admitted agree closely in physical characters, and in the amount of potash and water present. Average com position : Silica 46, alumina 30. potash 10, water 6 ; formula (Ramm.) HoKjAl^Si.O,.. The mineral is related chemically, as it is also physically, to serpentine ; and it is an alkali-alumina serpentine, as pyrophyllite is an alumina talc. The different kinds are either pseudomorphous crystals after (1) iolite; (2) nephelite; (3) scapolite; (4) some kind of feldspar ; (5) spodumene ; or (6) other aluminous mineral ; or (7) disseminated masses resembling indurated talc, steatite, lithomarge, or kaolinite, also a result of alteration ; or (8) the prominent or sole constituent of a metamorphic rock, which is some times a pinite schist (analogous to, and often much resembling, talcose schist, and still more closely related to pyrophyllite schist). Some prominent varieties are : Pinite. Speckstein [fr. the Pini mine at Aue, near Schneeberg]. Occurs in granite, and is supposed to be pseudomorphous after iolite. Gieseckite.

Crystallized, or cleavable and granular massive, (a) The asparagus stone (originally from Murcia, Spain) and moroxite (from Arendal) are ordinary apatite. The former was yellowish-green, as the name implies ; the latter was in greenish-blue and bluish crystals ; and the names have been used for apatite of the same shades from other places. 2. Fibrous, concretionary , stalactitic. The name Phosphorite was used by Kirwan for all apatite, but in his mind it especially included the fibrous concretionary and partly scaly mineral from Estremadura, Spain, and elsewhere. 3. Fluor-apatite, Chlor-apatite. Apatite also varies as to the proportion of fluorine to chlorine, one of these elements sometimes replacing nearly or wholly the other. Comp. \u2014 The formulas of the two varieties are SCasPiOs-f CaCl2=Phosphorus pentoxide 40*92. lime 53*80, chlorine 0*82= 101 *54 ; and 3Ca3P.208 + CaF2=Phosphorus pentoxide 42*26, lime 55*55, fluorine 3*77=101*58. Sometimes both calcium chloride (CaCl2), and calcium fluoride (CaF_), are present. Pyr. etc. \u2014 B.B. in the forceps fuses with difficulty on the edges (F. =4*5-5), coloring the flame reddish-yellow ; moistened with sulphuric acid and heated colors the flame pale bluish green (phosphoric acid) ; some varieties react for chlorine with salt of phosphorus, when the bead has been previously saturated with copper oxide, while others give fluorine when fused with this salt in an open glass tube. Gives a phosphide with the sodium test. Dissolves in hydrochloric and nitric acid, yielding with sulphuric acid a copious precipitate of calcium sulphate ; the dilute nitric acid solution gives with lead acetate a white precipi tate, which B.B. on charcoal fuses, giving a globule with crystalline facets on cooling. Some varieties of apatite phosphoresce on heating. Diff. \u2014 Characterized by its hexagonal form. Distinguished by its softness from beryl ; does not effervesce with acids like the carbonates ; unlike pyromorphite, yields no lead B.B. Obs. \u2014 Apatite occurs in rocks of various kinds and ages, but is mo^t common in metamor phic crystalline rocks, especially in granular limestone, granitic and many metalliferous veins, particularly those of tin, in gneiss, syenite, hornblendic gneiss, mica schist, beds of iron ore ; occasionally in serpentine, and in igneous or volcanic rocks ; sometimes in ordinary stratified limestone, beds of sandstone or shale of the Silurian, Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, or Tertiary formations ; also in microscopic crystals in many igneous rocks, doleryte, etc. It has been observed as the petrifying material of wood. Among its prominent localities are Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony ; region of St. Gothard in Switzerland ; Mussa-Alp in Piedmont ; Untersulzbachthal and elsewhere in the Tyrol ; Bohemia ; in England, in Cornwall, with tin ores ; in Cumberland ; in Devonshire ; at Wheal Franco (francolite), etc. The variety, moroxite, occurs at Arendal, Snarum, etc.. in Norway. The asparagus stone or Spargelstein of Jumilla, in Murcia, Spain, is pale yellowish-green in color; and a variety from Zillerthal is wine-yellow. The phosphorite, or massive radiated variety, is obtained abundantly near the junction of granite and argillyte, in Estremadura, Spain ; at Scblackenwald in Bohemia ; at Krageroe, etc. In Mass., at Norwich; at Bolton, and elsewhere. In New York, in St. Lawrence Co., in granular limestone; in Rossie; Sanford mine, Essex Co.; near Edenville, Orange Co. In New Jersey, near Suckasunny, ; Mt. Pleasant mine, near Mt. Teabo ; at Hurdstown, Sussex Co. In Penn., at Leiperville, Delaware Co.; in Chester Co. In Delaware, at Dixon's quarry, Wilmington. In Canada, in North Elmsley, and passing into South Burgess ; similar in Boss ; at the foot of Calumet Falls ; at St. Roch, on the Achigan. Apatite was named by Werner from airariiw, to deceive, older mineralogists having referred it to aquamarine, chrysolite, amethyst, fluor, schorl, etc. Osteolite is massive impure altered apatite. The ordinary compact variety looks like lithographic stone of white to gray color. It also occurs earthy. Hanau. Guano. \u2014 Guano is bone-phosphate of calcium, or osteolite, mixed with the hydrous phos phate, brushite, and generally with some carbonate of calcium, and often a little magnesia, alumina, iron, silica, gypsum, and other impurities. It often contains 9 or 10 p. c. of water. It is often granular or oolitic ; also compact through consolidation produced by infiltrating waters, in which case it is frequently lamellar in structure, and also occasionally stal -gmitic and stalactitic. Its colors are usually grayish-white, yellowish and dark brown, and some times reddish, and the lustre of a surface of fracture earthy to resinous."], [362, "344 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. Phosphatic Nodules. Coprolites. \u2014 Phosphatic nodules occur in many fossiliferous rocks, which are probably in all cases of organic origin. They sometimes present a spiral or other interior structure, derived from the animal organization that afforded them, and in such cases their coprolitic origin is unquestionable. In other cases there is no structure to aid in deciding whether they are true coprolites or not. PYROMORPHITE Griinbleierz, Germ, Hexagonal. Heniihedral. 0 A 1 = 139\u00b0 38' ; c = 0-7362.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Calcite is calcium carbonate, CaC03 = Carbon dioxide 41, lime 56 = 100. Part of the calcium is sometimes replaced by magnesium, iron, or manganese, more rarely by strontium, barium, zinc, or lead. The varieties are very numerous, and diverse in appearance. They depend mainly on the following points : (1) differences in crystallization; (2) in structural condition, the extremes being perfect crystals and earthy massive forms ; (3) in color, diaphaneity, odor on friction, due to impurities ; (4) in modes of origin. 1. Crystallized. Crystals and crystallized masses afford easily cleavage rhombohedrons ; and when transparent they are called Iceland Spar, and also Doubly-i efracting Spar (Doppels path, Germ.). The crystals vary in proportions from broad tabular to moderately slender acicular, and take a great diversity of forms. But the extreme kinds so pass into one another through those that are intermediate that no satisfactory classification is possible. Many are stout or short in shape because normally so. But other forms that are long tapering in their full develop-"], [396, "378 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. ment occur short and stout because abbreviated by an abrupt termination in a broad o, or an obtuse rhombohedron (as -} or It), or a low scalenohedron (as^3), or a combination of these forms ; and thus the crystals having essentially the same combinations of planes vary greatly in shape. The acute scalenohedrons like f. 724, are called dog-tooth spar. Fontainebleau limestone. Crystals of the form in f. 719c, from Fontainebleau and Nemours, France, containing a large amount of sand, some 50 to 63 p. c. Similar sandstone crys tals occur at Sievring, near Vienna, and elsewhere. Pseudomorphous scalenohedrons of sand stone, after calcite, are found near Heidelberg. Satin Spar; fine fibrous, with a silky lustre. Resembles fibrous gypsum, which is also called satin spar, but is much harder and effervesces with acids. Argentine (Schieferspath), a pearly lamellar calcite, the lamell\u00e6 more or less undulating ; color white, grayish, yeUowish, or reddish. Aphrile, in its harder and more sparry variety (Schaumspath) is a foliated white pearly calcite, near argentine ; in its softer kinds (Schaumerde, Silvery Chalk, Ecurne de Terre H. ) it approaches chalk, though lighter, pearly in lustre, silvery-white or yellowish in color, soft and greasy to the touch, and more or less scaly in structure. 2. Massive Varieties. Granular limestone (Saccharoidal limestone, so named because like loaf sugar in fracture). The texture varies from quite coarse to very fine granular, and the latter passes by imperceptible shades into' compact limestone. The colors are various, as white, yellow, reddish, green, and usually they are clouded and give a handsome effect when the material is polished. When such limestones are fit for polishing, or for architectural or orna mental use, they are called marbles. Statuary marble is pure white, fine grained, and firm in texture. Hard compact limestone, varies from nearly pure white, through grayish, drab, buff, yellowish, and reddish shades, to bluish-gray, dark brownish -gray, and black, and is some times variously veined. The colors dull, excepting ochre-yellow and ochre-red varieties. Many kinds make beautiful marble when polished. Shell-marble includes kinds consisting largely of fossil shells. Ruin-marble is a kind of com pact calcareous marl, showing, when polished, pictures of fortifications, temples, etc. , in ruins, due to infiltration of oxide of iron. Lithographic stone is a very even grained compact lime stone, usually of buff or drab color ; as that of Solenhofen. Breccia marble is made of frag ments of limestone cemented together, and is often very beautiful when the fragments are of different colors, or are imbedded in a base that contrasts well. The colors are very various. Pudding stone marble consists of pebbles or rounded stones cemented. It is often called, improperly, breccia marble. Hydraulic limestone is an impure limestone. The varieties in the United States contain 20 to 40 p. c. of magnesia, and 12 to 30 p. c. of silica and alumina. Soft compact limestone. Chalk is white, grayish-white, or yellowish, and soft enough to leave a trace on a board. The consolidation into a rock of such softness may be owing to the fact that the material is largely the hollow shells of rhizopods. Calcareous marl (Mergel kalk, Germ. ) is a soft earthy deposit, often hardly at all consolidated, with or without dis tinct fragments of shells ; it generally contains much clay, and graduates into a calcareous clay. Concretionarg massive. Oolite (Rogenstein, Germ.) is a granular limestone, but its grains are minute rounded concretions, looking somewhat like the roe of a fish, the name coming from 'uoi', egg. It occurs among all the geological formations, from the Lower Silurian to the most recent, and it is now forming about the coral reefs of Florida. Pisolite (Erbsentein, Germ. ) consists of concretions as large often as a small pea, or even larger, the concretions having usually a distinct concentric structure. It is formed in large masses in the vicinity of the Hot Springs at Carlsbad in Bohemia. Deposited from calcareous springs, streams, or in caverns, etc. (a) Stalactites are the calcareous cylinders or cones that hang from the roofs of limestone caverns, and which are formed from the waters that drip through the roof ; these waters hold some calcium bicarbonate in solu tion, and leave calcium carbonate to form the stalactite when evaporation takes place. Sta lactites vary from transparent to nearly opaque ; from a granular crystalline structure to a radiating fibrous ; from a white color and colorless to yellowish-gray and brown, (b) Stalag mite is the same material covering the floors of caverns, it being made from the waters that drop from the roofs, or from sources over the bottom or sides ; cones of it sometimes rise from the floor to meet the stalactites above. (c) Gale-sinter, Travertine, Caic Tufa. Travertine ( Confetto di Tivoli) is of essentially the same origin with stalagmite, but is distinctively a deposit from springs or rivers, especially where in large deposits, as along the river Anio, at Tivoli, near Rome, where the deposit is scores of feet in thickness. It has a very cavernous and irregularly banded structure, owing to its mode of formation. (di Agaric mineral; Rock-milk (Bergmilch, Montmilch, Germ.) is a very soft, white material. breaking* easily in the fingers, deposited sometimes in caverns, or about sources holding lime in solution."], [397, "OXYGEN COMPOUNDS.

B.B. infusible, but becomes caustic, glows, and colors the flame red ; after ignition the assay reacts alkaline ; moistened with hydrochloric acid imparts the charac teristic lime color to the flame. In borax dissolves with effervescence, and if saturated, yields on cooling an opaque, milk-white, crystalline bead. Varieties containing metallic oxides color the borax and salt of phosphorus beads accordingly. With soda on platinum foil fuses to a clear mass ; on charcoal it at first fuses, but later the soda is absorbed by the coal, leaving an infusible and strongly luminous residue of lime. In the solid mass effervesces when moistened with hydrochloric acid, and fragments dissolve with brisk effervescence even in cold acid.

Bergol, Steinol, Erdiil, Germ. Petroleum is a thick to thin fluid. Color yellow or brown, or colorless ; translucent to transparent. The specific gravity varies from 0*7 to 0*9. Chemically it consists essentially of carbon and hydrogen ; contain ing several members of the naphtha group, as also the oils of the ethylene series, and the paraffins. The proportion of the latter constituents increases with the increase of the density or viscidity of the fluid. It grades insensibly into pittasphalt, and that into solid bitumen. Occurs in rocks or deposits of nearly all geological ages, from the Lower Silurian to the present epoch. It is associated most abundantly with argillaceous shales and sandstones, but is found also permeating limestones, giving them a bituminous odor, and rendering them sometimes a considerable source of oil. From these oliferous shales and limestones the oil often exudes, and appears floating on the streams or lakes of the region, or rises in oil springs. It also exists collected in subterranean cavities in certain rocks, whence it issues in jets or fountains whenever an outlet is made by boring. These cavities are situated mostly along the course of gentle anticlinals in the rocks of the region ; and it is therefore probable, as has been suggested, that they originated for the most part in the displacements of the strata caused by the slight uplift. The oil which fills the cavities has ordinarily been derived from the subjacent rocks ; for the strata, in which the cavities exist, are frequently barren sandstones. Obtained in large quantities from the oil wells of Pennsylvania ; also found in eastern Vir ginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and New York. In Canada, at several places ; in southern California ; in Mexico ; Trinidad. Some well-known foreign localities are : Rangoon, Burmah ; western shore of the Caspian Sea ; in Parma, Italy ; Sicily ; Galicia ; Tegernsee, Bavaria ; Hanover. (b) The Olefiant or Ethylene series.

The different species varying in the yalue of n, vary also in boiling point, and other characters. Paraffins occur in the Pennsylvania petroleum, a freezing mixture reducing the tempera ture being sufficient to separate it in crystals. Also in the naphtha of the Caspian, in Ran goon tar, and many other liquid bitumens. It is a result of the destructive distillation of peat, bituminous coal, lignite, coaly or bituminous shales, most viscid bitumens, wood-tar, and many other substances. The name is from the Latin parum, little, and ajfinis, alluding to the feeble affinity for other substances, or, in other words, its chemical indifference.

In the royal museum at Berlin there is a mass weighing* 18 lbs. Another in the kingdom of Ava, India, is nearly as large as a child's head, and weighs \"I lbs. It is now fully ascertained that amber is a vegetable resin altered by fossilization. This is inferred both from its native situation with coal, or fossil wood, and from the occurrence of insects incased in it. Of these insects, some appear evidently to have struggled after being entangled in the then \\ iscous fluid ; and occasionally a leg or a wing is found some distance from the body, which had been detached in the effort to escape. Amber was early known to the ancients, and called i/'/eurpov, electrurn, whence, on account of its electrical susceptibilities, we have derived the word electricity. It was named by some lyncurium, though this name was applied by Theophrastus also to a stone, probably to zircon or tourmaline, both minerals of remarkable electrical properties.

Asphalt, Mineral Pitch. Bergpech, Erdpech, Germ. Asphaltum, or mineral pitch, is a mixture of different hydrocarbons, part of which are oxygenated. Its ordinary characters are as follows: Amorphous. G. = 1-1-8 ; sometimes higher from impurities. Lustre like that of black pitch. 'Color brownish-black and black. Odor bitumi nous. Melts ordinarily at 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C, and burns with a bright flame. Soluble mostly or wholly in. oil of turpentine, and partly or wholly in ether; commonly partly in alcohol. The more solid kinds graduate into the pittasphalts or mineral tar, and through these there is a gradation to petroleum. The fluid kinds change into the solid by the loss of a vaporizable portion on exposure, and also by a process of oxidation, which consists first in a loss of hydrogen, and finally in the oxygenation of a portion of the mass. Obs \u2014 Asphaltum belongs to rocks of no particular age. The most abundant deposits are superficial. But these are generally, if not always, connected with rock deposits containing some kind of bituminous material or vegetable remains. Some of the noted localities of asphaltum are the region of the Dead Sea, or Lake Asphal tites, on Trinidad ; at various places in S. America, as at Caxitambo, Peru; at Berengela, Peru, not far from Arica (S.) ; in California, near the coast of St. Barbara. Also in smaller quantities, sometimes disseminated through shale, and sandstone rocks, and occasionally lime stones, or collected in cavities or seams in these rocks ; near Matlock, Derbyshire ; Poldice mine in Cornwall ; Val de Travers, Neuchatel ; impregnating dolomite on the island of Brazza in Dalmatia ; in the Caucasus ; in gneiss and mica schist in Sweden. The following substances are closely related to asphaltum, and, like it, are mixtures of un determined carbohydrogens. Guahamite, Wurtz. \u2014 Resembles the preceding in its pitch-black, lustrous appearance; H. = 2; G. =1*145.

No action with alkalies or hot nitric or hydrochloric acid. Melts only imperfectly, and with a decomposition of the surface ; but in this state the interior may be drawn into long threads. Occurs in W. Vir ginia, about 20 m. in an air line S. of Parkersburg, filling a fissure (shrinkage fissure) in a sandstone of the Carboniferous formation ; and supposed to be, like the albertite, an inspis sated and oxygenated petroleum. Albertite, Rnbb. \u2014 Differs from ordinary asphaltum in being only partially soluble in oil of turpentine, and in its very imperfect fusion when heated. It has H. = 1-2; G. = 1*097; lustre brilliant, pitch-like ; color jet-black. Softens a little in boiling water ; in the flame of a candle shows incipient fusion. According to imperfect determinations, only a trace soluble in alcohol ; 4 p. c. in ether ; 30 in oil of turpentine.

MINERAL COAL The distinguishing characters of Mineral Coal are as follows : Compact massive, without crystalline structure or cleavage ; sometimes breaking with a degree of regularity, but from a jointed rather than a cleavage struc ture. Sometimes laminated ; often faintly and delicately banded, successive layers differing slightly in lustre. H.=0-5-2-5. G. = l-1-S0. Lustre dull to brilliant, and either earthy, resinous, or submetallic. Color black, grayish-black, brownish-black, and occasionally iridescent ; also sometimes dark brown. Opaque. Fracture conchoidal \u2014 uneven. Brittle ; rarely somewhat sectile. Without taste, except from impurities present. Insoluble or nearly so in alcohol, elher, naphtha, and benzole. Infusible to subfusible ; but often becoming a soft, pliant, or paste-like mass when heated. On distillation most kinds afford more or less of oily and tarry substances, which are mixtures of hydrocar bons and paraffin. Mineral coal is made up of different kinds of hydrocarbons, with perhaps in some cases free carbon. Var. \u2014 The variations depend partly (1) on the amount of the volatile iugredients afforded on destructive destination ; or (2) on the nature of these volatile compounds, for ingredients of similar composition may differ widely in volatility, etc. ; (3) on structure, lustre, and other physical characters. 1. Anthracite. H. =2-2*5. G. =1*32-1*7, Pennsylvania; 1*81, Rhode Island ; 1*26-1*36, South Wales. Lustre bright, often submetallic, iron black, and frequently iridescent. Frac ture conchoidal. Volatile matter after drying 3 to 6 p. c. Burns with a feeble flame of a pale color. The anthracites of Pennsylvania contain ordinarily 85 to 93 per cent, of carbon ; those of South Wales, 88 to 95 ; of France, 80 to 83 ; of Saxony, 81 ; of southern Russia, some times 94 per cent. Anthracite graduates into bituminous coal, becoming less hard, aud con taining more volatile matter ; and an intermediate variety is called free-burning anthracite. Bituminous Coals (Steinkohie pt. , Germ.). Under the head of Bituminous Coals, a number of kinds are included which differ strikingly in the action of heat, aud which there fore are of unlike constitution. They have the common characteristic of burning in the fire with a yellow, smoky flame, and giving out on distillation hydrocarbon oils or tar, aud hence the name bituminous. The ordinary bituminous coals contain from 5 to 15 p. c. (rarely 16 or 17) of oxygen (ash excluded) ; while the so-called brown coal or lignite contains from 20 to 36 p. c, after the expulsion, at 100J C, of 15 to 36 p. c. of water. The amount of hydrogen in each is from 4 to 7 p. c. Both have usually a bright, pitchy, greasy lustre (whence often called Pechkohle in German), a firm compact texture, are rather fragile compared with anthra cite, and have G. = 1 * 1 4-1 *40. The brown coals have often a brownish-black color, whence the name, and more oxygen, but in these respects and others they shade into ordinary bitu minons coals. The ordinary bituminous coal of Pennsylvania has G. =1 -26-1 -37 ; of New castle, England, 1*27; of Scotland, 1*27-1*32; of France, 1*2-1*33; of Belgium, 1*27-1*3. The most prominent kinds are the following: 2. Caking Coal. A bituminous coal which softens and becomes pasty or semi-viscid in the fire. This softening takes place at the temperature of incipient decomposition, and is attended with the escape of bubbles of gas. On increasing the heat, the volatile products which result from the ultimate decomposition of the softened mass are driven off, and a coherent, grayish-black, cellular, or fritted mass (coke) is left. Amount of coke left (or part not volatile) varies from 50 to 85 p. c. Byerite is from Middle Park, Colorado. 3. Non-Caking Coal. Like the preceding in all external characters, and often in ultimate composition ; but burning freely without softening or any appearance of incipient fusion. 4. Cannel Coal (Parrot Coal). A variety of bituminous coal, and often caking ; but dif fering from the preceding in texture, and to some extent in composition, as shown by its products on distillation. It is compact, with little or no lustre, and without any appearance of a banded structure; and it breaks with a conchoidal fracture and smooth surfaces; color dull black or grayish-black. On distillation it affords, after drying, 40 to 66 of volatile mat ter and the material volatilized includes a large proportion of burning and lubricating oils,"], [414, "396 DESCRIPTIVE MINERALOGY. much larger than the above kinds of bituminous coal ; whence it is extensively used for the manufacture of such oils. It graduates into oil-producing coaly shales, the more compact of which it much resembles. 5. Torbanite. A variety of cannel coal of a dark brown color, yellowish streak, without lustre, having a subconchoidal fracture; H. =2*25; G. = 1*17-1*2. Yields over 60 p. c. of volatile matter, and is used for the production of burning and lubricating oils, paraffin, illu minating gas. From Torbane Hill, near Bathgate in Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Also called Boghead Cannel. 6. Brown Coal (Braunkohle Germ., Pechkohle pt. Germ., Lignite). The prominent characteristics of brown coal have already been mentioned. They are non-caking, but afford a large proportion of volatile matter. They are sometimes pitch-black (whence Pechkohle pt. Germ.), but often rather dull and brownish- black. G. =1*15-1*3; sometimes higher from impurities. It is occasionally somewhat lamellar in structure. Brown coal is often called lignite. But this term is sometimes restricted to masses of coal which still retain the form of the original wood. Jet is a black variety of brown coal, compact in texture, and taking a good polish, whence its use in jewelry. 7. Earthy Brown Coal (Erdige Braunkohle) is a brown friable material, sometimes form ing layers in heds of brown coal. But it is in general not a true coal, a considerable part of it being soluble in ether and benzole, and often even in alcohol ; besides affording largely of oils and paraffin on distillation. Comp. \u2014 Most mineral coal consists mainly, as the best chemists now hold, of oxygenated hydrocarbons. Besides oxygenated hydrocarbons, there may also be present simple hydrocar bons (that is, containing no oxygen). Sulphur is present in nearly all coals. It is supposed to be usually combined with iron, and when the coal affords a red ash on burning, there is reason for believing this true. But Percy mentions a coal from New Zealand (anal. 18) which gave a peculiarly white ash, although containing 2 to 3 p. c. of sulphur, a fact showing that it is present not as a sulphide of iron, but as a constituent of an organic compound. The discovery by Church of a re^in containing sulphur (see Tj\\smanite, p. 393), gives reason for inferring that it may exist in this coal in that state, although its presence as a constituent of other organic compounds is quite possible. The chemical relations of the different kinds of coals will be understood from the follow ing analyses : Carbon. Hydrogen. Oxvgen. Nitrogen. Sulphur. Ash. 1. Anthracite, S.

Brown Coal, Meissen, Sax. 58*90 5-36 21-63 6*61 7*50 Coal occurs in beds, interstratified with shales, sandstones, and conglomerates, and some times limestones, forming distinct layers, which vary from a fraction of an inch to 30 feet or more in thickness. In the United States, the anthracites occur east of the Alleghany range, in rocks that have undergone great contortions and fracturings, while the bituminous are found farther west, in rocks that have been less disturbed ; and this fact and other observa tions have led some geologists to the view that the anthracites have lost their bitumen by the action of heat. The origin of coal is mainly vegetable, though animal life has contributed somewhat to the result. The beds were once beds of vegetation, analogous, in most respects, in mode of formation to the peat beds of modern times, yet in mode of burial often of a very different character. This vegetable origin is proved not only by the occurrence of the leaves, stems, and logs of plants in the coal, but also by the presence throughout its texture, in many cases, of the forms of the original fibres; also by the direct observation that peat is a transition state between unaltered vegetable debris aud brown coal, being sometimes found passing completely into true brown coal. Peat differs from true coal in want of homo geneity, it visibly containing vegetable fibres only partially altered ; and wherever changed to a fine-textured homogeneous material, even though hardly consolidated, it may be true brown coal. Extensive beds of mineral coal occur in Great Britain, covering 11,859 square miles; in France about 1,719 sq. m. ; in Spain about 3,408 sq. m. ; in Belgium 518 sq. m. ; in Nether lands, Prussia, Bavaria, Austria, northern Italy, Silesia, Spain, Russia on the south near the Azof, and also in the Altai. It is found in Asia, abundantly in China, etc., etc. In the United States there are four separate coal areas. One of these areas, the Appala chian coal field, commences on the north, in Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio, and sweep-"], [415, "397 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. ing south over western Virginia and eastern Kentucky and Tennessee to the west of the Appalachians, or partly involved in their ridges, it continues to Alabama, near Tuscaloosa, where a bed of coal has been opened. It has been estimated to cover 00.000 sq. m. A sec ond coal area (the Illinois) lies adjoining the Mississippi, and covers the larger part of Illinois, though much broken into patches, and a small northwest part of Kentucky. A third covers the central portion of Michigan, not far from 5,000 sq. m. in area. Besides these, there is a smaller coal region (a fourth) in Rhode Island. The total area of workable coal measures in the United States is about 125,000 sq. m. Out of the borders of the United States, on the northeast, commences a fifth coal area, that of Nova Scoria and New Brunswick, which covers, in connection with that of Newfoundland, 18,000 sq. m. The mines of western Pennsylvania, those of the States west, and those of Cumberland or Frostburg, Maryland, Richmond or Chesterfield, Va. , and other mines south, are bituminous. Those of eastern Pennsylvania constituting several detached areas \u2014 one, the Schuylkill coal field \u2014 another, the Wyoming coal field \u2014 those of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and some patches in Virginia, are anthracites. Cannel coal is found near Greensburg. Beaver Co., Pa., in Kenawha Co , Va., at Peytona, etc. ; also in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana ; but part of the so-called cannel is a coaly shale. Brown coal comes from coal beds more recent than those of the Carboniferous age. But much of this more recent coal is not distinguishable from other bituminous coals. The coal of Richmond, Virginia, is supposed to be of the Liassic or Triassic era ; the coal of Brora, in Sutherland, and of Bovey, Yorkshire, is Oolitic in age. Cretaceous coal occurs on Van couver Island, and Cretaceous and Tertiary coal in many places over the Rocky Mountains, where a \" Lignitic formation\" is very widely distributed."], [416, ""], [417, "APPENDIX A. SYNOPSIS OF MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. THE following pages contain a concise presentation of the System of Crystallography pro posed by Prof. W. H. Miller in 1839, and now employed by a large proportion of the workers in Mineralogy. The attempt has been made to present the subject briefly, and yet with suffi cient fulness to enable any one having some previous knowledge of Crystallography not only to understand the System, but also to use it himself. For the full development of the subject, especially of its theoretical side, reference must be made to the works of Miller, Grailich, von Lang, and Schrauf, referred to in the Introduction, as also to the admirable Lectures of Prof. Maskelyne, printed in the Chemical News for 1873 (vol. xxxi., 3, 13, 24, 63, 101, 111, 121, 153, 200, 232). General Principles. The indices of Miller and their relation to those of Naumann.\u2014The position of a plane ABC (f. 751) is determined when the distances OA, OB, OC are known, which it cuts off in the assumed axes X, Y, Z from their point of intersection 0. The lengths of these axes for a single plane of a crystal being taken as units, thus OA = a, OB = *, OC = c, it is found that the lengths of the corresponding lines OH, OK, OL for any other plane, HKL, of the same crys-"], [418, "400 APPENDIX. tal always bear some simple relation, expressed in whole numbers, to these assumed units. This relation may be expressed as follows : OK~* a J 0H = A A-< or in the more common form la 1 * 1 c (1\u00bb h ' OH k ' OK . ' OL The numbers represented by h, k, I are called the indices of the plane and determine its position, when the elements of the crystal \u2014 the lengths and mutual inclinations of the axes are known. When the lines are taken in the opposite direction from 0, they are called nega tive ; the corresponding negative character of the indices is indicated by the minus sign placed over the index, thus, h, k, or /. When the unit, or fundamental form, is appropriately chosen, the numbers representing h, />*, I seldom exceed six. The above relation may also be written in the form : OH OK OL \u2014 = r --\u2014 = n \u2014 = m. a b c Here r, n, m, which are obviously the reciprocals of the indices h, k, I respectively, are essentially identical with the symbols of Naumann. For example, if h = 3, k = 2, I = 2, then r = J*, n = 4, m = i, and the symbol (322) of Miller becomes ia : -J b : ii; but by Nau mann's usage this is so transformed that r = 1, and n > 1 (or sometimes n = 1, and r > 1), in other words, by multiplying through by 3, in this case, the symbol takes the form a : %b : fe,* or, as abbreviated, if-f (.Pf). The symbol a : i b : f. properly belongs to theplane MNR (f. 751), which is parallel to, and hence crystallographically identical (p. 11) with the plane HKL. Special values of the indices li, k, I. It is obvious that several distinct cases are possible : (1) The three indices h, k, I are all greater than unity, then including the various pyramidal planes. The number of similar planes corresponding to the general form -j hkl '- depends upon the degree of symmetry of the crystalline system, and upon the special values of h, k, I, e.g., h = /.*, etc. These cases are considered later in their proper place. (2) One of the three indices may be equal to zero, indicating then that the plane is parallel to the axis corresponding to this index. Thus the symbol (hkO), = a : nb : so c, or na : b : oo_ (p. 11), belongs to the planes parallel to the vertical axis i, as shown in f. 752. They are called prismatic planes. The symbol (hOl), = . : co_* : me (p. 11) belongs to the planes par allel to the axis b, as in f. 753. The symbol (Oki), = co a : b : me, belongs to the planes parallel to the axis a, f. 754. (3) Two of the indices may be zero, the symbol (hkl) then becomes (001), = cost : ooi : ., the basal plane, f. 755 ; (010), = x a : b : oo c ; and (100), = a : ooi : ac c. These are the three diametral or pinacoid planes. The symbol (010) represents the clinopinacoid (i-i) of the Monoclinic system, but (following Miller) the macropinneoid (i-i) of the Orthorhombic. Similarly (7/00 belongs to the ortho- * The symbol is written here in this order to correspond with the ( . k I) of Miller; on page 10, and subsequently, the reverse order fc : ib : a was adopted for the sake of uni formity with Naumann' s abbreviated symbols."], [419, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 401 domes of the Monoclinic, but the brachydomes of the Orthorhombic system ; also (Oki) belongs to the clinodomes of the former, and the macrodomes of the latter. See also p. 415. Spherical Projection.\u2014 It the centre of a crystal, that is, the point of intersection of the three axes, be taken as the centre of a sphere, and normals be drawn from it to the successive planes of the crystals, the points, where they meet the surface of the sphere, will be the poles of the respective planes. For example, in f. 756 the com mon centre of the crystal and sphere is at O, the normal to the plane b meets the surface of the sphere at B, of b' at B', of d and e at D and E respectively, and so on. These poles evidently determine the position of the plane in each case. It is obvious that the pole of the plane b' (010) opposite b (010), will be at the oppo site extremity of the diameter of the sphere, and so in general, (120) and (120), etc. It is seen also that all the poles, or normal points, of planes in the same zone, that is, planes whose intersection-lines are parallel, are in the same great circle, for instance the planes * (010), d (110), a (100), c (110), and so on. It is customary* in the use of the sphere to regard it as projected upon a horizontal plane, usually that normal to the prismatic zone, so that, as in f. 759, the prismatic planes lie in the circumference of the circle, and the other planes within it. The eye being supposed to be situated at the opposite extremity of the diameter of the sphere normal to this plane, the great circles then appear either as arcs of circles, or as straight lines, i.e., diameters. It will be further obvious from f. 750 that the arc BD, between the poles of b and d, mea sures an angle at the centre (BOD), which is the supplement of the actual interior angle bud between the two planes. This fact, that the arc of a great circle intercepted between the poles of two planes always gives the supplement of the actual angle between the planes them selves, is most important, and does much to facilitate the ease of calculation. In consequence of this, it is customary with many crystallographers to give for the angle between two planes, not the interfacial angle, but that between their normals. It is one of the great advantages of this method of projection that it may be employed to show not only the relative positions of the planes, but also those of the optic axes, and the axes of elasticity. Relation between the indices of a plane and the angle made by it icith the axes \u2014 When the assumed axes are at right angles to each other they coincide with the normals to the pinacoid planes (001, 010, 100). and 757 consequently meet the spherical surface at their poles. When the axial angles are not 90 , this is no longer true. In ail cases, however, the following relation holds good between the cosines of the angles made by a plane with the axes : a=.\u00ab\u00ab d\u2014 py a\u2014 \u00ab\u2022 But from the equation (1) before given, by the introduction of the values of OH, OK, OL, we obtain : 4- cos PX = - cos PY = 4- cos PZ. h k I (2) This equation is fundamental, and many of the relations given beyond are deduced from it. It will be seen that in the case of the orthometric systems the angles PX. PY, PZ are the supplement-angles between any plane (hkl) and the pinacoids (001), (010), (l00). Relations between planes in the same zone.\u2014Bj the use of the equation (2), it may be shown * On the construction of the spherical projection, see p. 58."], [420, "402 APPENDIX. that if two planes (hkl) and (pqr) lie in the same zone, that the following equation must hold good : via cos XQ + vi cos YQ -t- we cos ZQ = 0, where u = kr \u2014 lq, v = lp \u2014 hr, w = hq \u2014 kp. The letters u, v, w are called the symbol of the zone or great circle PR. Every plane H(xyz) of this zone must satisfy the equation : nx + vy + W2 = 0. (3) If now (uvw) be the symbol of one zone, and (efg: of another intersecting it, then the point of intersection will be the pole of a plane lying in both zones, whose indices (hkl) must satisfy two equations similar to (3). These indices are equal to: h = gv \u2014 f w k = ew \u2014 gu I = f u \u2014 ev. The application of this principle is extremely simple, and its importance cannot be over estimated. Some examples are added here, showing the method of use. Examples of the methods of calculation by zones. \u2014 (1) For the zone of planes between (100) and (001), the zone indices are u = 0, v = \u2014 1, w = 0. They are obtained by multiplication in the manner indicated in the following scheme : In general h k I h k In this case 10 0 10 XXX XXX p q r p q 00100 u = kr \u2014 Iq ; v = Ip \u2014 hr; w = hq \u2014 kp. n = 0; v = 1 ; w = 0. Consequently every plane (hkl) in the zone named must answer the condition : vJi + vi + wl \u2014 0, that is, in this case k = 0. The general symbol is consequently (/(Of). Compare f. 759. 0 0 10 0 (2) For the zone (001), (010), in a similar manner: XX \\Z XY 0 10 0 1 u = 1, v = 0, w = 0, and the equation of condition becomes h = 0, and the general sym bol is (Oki). Compare f. 759. (3) For the prismatic zone between (100) and (010), the general symbol will be fouud to be (hkQ). Compare f. 759. 758 (4) For the pyramidal zone between the basal plane (001) and 0 0 10 0 the unit prism (110), we have the scheme : XX XX XX 110 11 Hence u = 1, v = l,w = 0, and the equation of condition be comes h \u2014 k, and hence the general symbol is hid for the unit pyra mids. For a plane lying at once in two zones, for instance the plane lettered 2-3 in f. 758, lying in the zone 1, 2-2, 1-i, and in the zone i-i, 3-3, 2-2, 1, 1-i. The indices, uvw_, for the first zone \\-i (101), 1 (110), are, obtained as above, u = 1, v = 1, w = 1. Again, for the zone between i-i (100), 1-i (011), the zone indices, efg, are, e = 0, f = 1, g = 1. The indices (likl), for the plane (2-2 lying in both these zones, and hence answering to two equations of condi tion, are obtained by multiplication in a scheme exactly like that already given, viz. : In general u v w u v In this case 11111 XXX, .XXX. efgef 01101 h = gv \u2014 f w ; k = ew \u2014 gu ; I = fu \u2014 ev. ft = 8;A = l;_ = l. The plane has consequently the symbol (211)."], [421, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 403 For the zone of planes, lettered on the figure (f. 758) i-i, 3-5, 2-2, etc., the indices, as already shown, are e = 0, f = 1, g = 1, and consequently the equation of condi- 759 and consequently the equation of condi tion reduces to * = I, and the general symbol is hkk. This zone is shown on the spherical projection, f. 759, and includes the planes 100 (i-i), 311 (3-3), 211 (2-2), 111 (1), Oil (1-i), and so on. A second example of the above method is afforded by the plane lettered 2-2 in f. 758. It lies in the zone i-i (010) to 1-i (101), whose indices, uvw, obtained as be fore, are, u = 1, v = 0, w = 1. It is also in the zone between J(110) and 1-i (011), whose indices, efg, are, e =1, f = 1, g = 1. Its own symbol (hkl) is deduced as above : I 0 1 1 0 XXX 11111 * = _.; k = 2; 1=1. The symbol is consequently (121). The position of this plane is shown on the spherical projection, f. 759, as also that of the zone first mentioned above, whose indices were u = 1, v = 0. w = 1, and for which the equation (3) consequently reduces to h = I ; the gen eral symbol is then (hkh), the planes 010 (i-i), 121 (2-2), 111 (1), 101 (1-i), etc., belong in this zone. The example employed here serves to show the extensive application of this principle of zones. Supposing that in this crystal, f. 758, J (110), and 1-i (101) have been assumed as fundamental planes in their respective zones, the symbols of all the others may be obtained in this way, without the necessity of a single measurement ; the reflective gonometer would indicate the presence of the few necessary zones not shown by the parallel intersections. Methods of Calculation. \u2014 In consequence of the wide application of this method of deter mining the symbols of a plane by the zones in which it lies, actual trigonometrical calcula tions are not very frequently required. The methods employed are always those of spherical trigonometry, and in most cases no formulas are needed, the problems arising requiring nothing but the solution of the triangles, mostly right-angled, seen on the spherical projection. It is to be remembered that an arc of a great circle, between two poles, shown in the projec tion, is always the supplement of the actual inters acial angle between the planes themselves. Some of the more commonly used formulas for the solution of spherical triangles, which have been already given on p 62, are, for the sake of convenience, repeated here. In right-angled spherical triangles C = 90 J, h = the hypothenuse. sin a sin b Sin A = - \u2014 r sin B = -. \u2014 r sm Ii sm Ii tan b tan a Cos A = , \u2014 j cos B = - r tan A tan h tan a _ tan b Tan A = . \u2014 j tan B = . \u2014 sm 0 sm rt cos B . cos A Sin A = r sin B = cos b cos a cos h = cos a cos b cos h = cot A cot B In oblique-angled spherical triangles : (1) Sin A : sin B = sin a : sin b ; (2) Cos a = cos b cos _ + sin b sin . cos A ; (3) Cot b sin c = cos c cos A + sin A cot B ; (4) Cos A = \u2014 cos B cos C + sin B sin C cos a."], [422, "404 APPENDIX, In calculation it is often more convenient to use, instead of the latter formulas, those especially arranged for logarithms, which will be found in any of the many books devoted to mathematical formulas. In addition to the mere solution of triangles on the spherical projection, it is also necessary to connect by equations the actually measured angles with the lengths and inclinations of axes of the crystals themselves. These equations are given in connection with the different systems. The following relation between the planes in the same zone is also of very wide appli cation : Let P, Q, S, R be the poles of four planes in a zone (f. 760), having the following indices, viz. : P = (hkl), Q = (pqr), R = (uvw), S = (xyz). The folowing relation may 700 be deduced between them, on the supposition that PQ < PR. cot PS -cot PR _ (P.Q) (S.R) cot PQ - cot PR ~~ (Q.R) ' (P.S) * (P.Q) _ kr \u2014 lq _ Ip \u2014 hr _ hq \u2014 kp (Q.R) qw \u2014 ru ru\u2014pw pv \u2014 qui1 (S.R) _wy \u2014 zv _zu \u2014 xw _xv \u2014yu (P.S) _ te-ly ~ Ix-hz ~ hy - kx * ' (5) Here, By means of the above equation it is possible to deduce the indices or angle of a fourth plane, when those of the three others are given. In the application of this principle it is essential that the planes should be taken in the proper order, as shown above ; to accomplish this it is often necessary to use the indices and corresponding angles, not of (hkl), but its opposite plane (hkl), etc. In the orthometric systems this relation admits of being much simplified. If one of the above four planes coincides with a pinacoid plane (100), (010), or (001), and another with a plane in a zone with a second pinacoid 90 : from the first, then the following relations hold good for two planes P(hkl), and Q(pqr) in this zone : h tan PA p ' tan QA k _ I q r ' . . _ k tan PB _ l p~ q' tan QB \"~ r' h k I tan PC p q r ' tan QC\" As a further simplification of the above equation for the case of a prismatic plane (hkO), or a dome (hOl) or (Oki), between two pinacoid planes 90\" from another, we have : h _ tan (100) (110) # h _ tan (001) (hOl) _ k __ tan (001) (Oki) k ~ tan (100) (hkOy 1 ~~ tan (001) (101) ' . ~ tan (001) (Oil)' These equations are the ones ordinarily employed to determine the symbol of any prismatic plane or dome. It will be seen at once that all the above relations for rectangular zones are essentially identical with those given on p. 59, though here expressed in a clearer and more concise form. Systems of Crystallization. All crystals are divided into six classes, according to the degree of symmetry which charac terizes them. This symmetry, as well as the relations of the different planes of a crystal, is shown in the lengths and position of the axes which are taken for each. With reference to their axial relations crystals are divided into the following six systems: I. Isometric System. \u2014 Three equal axes (a, a, a) at right angles to one another. II. Tetragonal System. \u2014 Two equal lateral axes (a, a), and a third vertical axis (.) of un equal length; all at right angles."], [423, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 405 III. Hexagonal System. \u2014 Three equal lateral axes (a, a, a) crossing at angles of 60\u00b0, and a fourth vertical axis (c) of unequal length, perpendicular to the plane of the others. IV. Orthorhombic System. \u2014 Three unequal axes (., h, a) at right angles to each other. V. Monoclinic System \u2014 Three unequal axes (<*, * , d) ; the angle between 6 and b, and between b and d = 90 , but the angle between _ and a greater and less than 90\u00b0. VI. Triclinic System. \u2014 Three unequal axes (i, b, a.) ; the axial angles a, /}, y all oblique. I. Isometric System. The symbol [hkl] embraces all the forms possible under each system in the most general case. Since in the Isometric System all the axes are of equal value, it obviously follows from the symmetry of the system that each one of the indices may be exchanged for each of the others, so that the total number of planes possible will be given by all the arrangements of the indices \u00b1h, \u00b1k, \u00b11, or 3s follows: hkl hkl hkl Tiki hkl hkl hkl hkl hlk hlk hlk hlk hlk hlk hlk hlk kid kid khl khl khl hid khl khl klh Ihk klh Ihk klh Ihk klh Ihk klh Ihk klh Ihk klh Ihh klh Ihk Ikh Ikh Ikh ikh Ikh Ikh Ikh Ikh A. Ilolohedral Forms. There are seven cases possible among the holohedral forms of this system, according to the values of h, k, I. These are shown in the list below, to which are added the symbols, after Naumann, given on p. 14, though, as already explained, written in the inverse order. In the most general case [hkl]* the form includes forty eight similar planes, and in the most special case [100], there are included six similar planes. Miller. 1. [hkl] ; h>k>l. 2. [hkkl ; /.>__. 3.

There are two kinds of hemihedral forms observed, as shown on p. 20: (1) the holohemi hedral, where half the quadrants have the whole number of planes ; and (2) the hohhemihedral where all the quadrants have half the full number of planes. The first kind produces inclined hemihedrons, indicated by the symbol s[hkl], and the second kind produces parallel hemihe drons, indicated by the symbol rr[hklj.

Inclined hemihedrism as applied to the three other solids of this system produces forms in no way different, in outward appearance, from the holohedral forms. Parallel Hemihedrism produces distinct, independent, forms only in the case of the tetrahexahedron and the hexoctahedron. The symbol of the former is ~[hk0], and of the latter, -[hkH] ; they are shown in f. 778-782. Tetratohedral forms of several kinds are possible in this system, but they are of small piactical interest. Mathematical Relations of the Isometric System.

In many cases, however, the simplest method of solution of a given prob lem is by means of the spherical triangles on the projection (f. 766;. II. Tetragonal System. In the Tetragonal System, since the vertical axis c has a different length from the two equal lateral axes, the index., referring to it, is never exchangeable for the other indices, /.andi. The general form [hkl] consequently embraces all the planes which have as their symbols the different arrangements of \u00b1 h, \u00b1k, \u00b1 I, in which I always holds the last place.

(1) The distances of the pole of any plane F(hkl) from the pinacoid planes 100 (= PA), 010 (= PB), 001 (= PC) are given by the following equations: h?c2 k'c2 Pa2 cos' PA = w+w+w ; cos2 PB = w+w+p* ; cos2 PC = *V+W+iV These may also be expressed in the form : ,-oa kV + Pa2 h2c2 + Pa2 \\ h2c2 + k2c2 tan2 PA = =-\u2014 \u2014 ; tan8 PB = \u2014 -=-= \u2014 ; tan- PC = j***-*; \u2014 h'c2 k'c- Pa2 (2) For the distance between the poles of any two planes (hkl), (pqr), we have in general : cos po __ hpc2 + kqc2 + lra2 + k2)c2 + Pd2] [(p2 + q2)C2 + r2a2]' The above equations take a simpler form for special cases often occurring. (3) Planes in the same zone. \u2014 For the general case of planes (hkl) and (pqr) the re lation given in equation 4 (p. 404) is made use of. In the special cases, practically of the most importance, where the planes lie in a zone with a pinacoid plane, the simplified formulas are employed. For the octagonal prism this relation becomes : h tan (100) (hkO) = cot (010) {/tkO) = - Determination of the axis c. \u2014 This follows from equation (1), p. 401, which, for this case, becomes : 1 _ j cos PA = - cos PC, (a = 1) For an octahedron (hOl) in the diametral series, we have cA tan (hOl) (001) = -=. For the unit octahedron (111), we have : tan (111) (001).cos45\u00b0 = i . III. Hexagonal System. The Hexagonal System and its hemihedral, or rhombohedral, division are both included by Miller in his Rhombohedral System (see p. 420). All hexagonal and rhombohedral forms are referred by him to three equal axes, oblique to one another, and normal to the faces of the unit rhombohedron. This method has the great disadvantage of failing to exhibit the hexagonal symmetry existing in the holohedral forms, since in this way the similar planes of a hexagonal pyramid receive two different sets of symbols, having no apparent connection with each other. It, moreover, hides the relation between this system and the tetragonal system, which, optically, are identical, since they possess alike one axis of optical symmetry. The latter difficulty was avoided by Schrauf, who introduced the Ortiioiiexagonal Sys tem. In this the optical axis was made the crystallographical vertical axis, and otherwise two lateral axes, at right angles to each other, were assumed, a and a t 3. This method, how ever, does not overcome the other objection named above. In the method of Weiss and Naumann a vertical axis, coinciding with the optical axis, was adopted, and three lateral axes in a plane at right angles to it, they intersecting at angles of 60\", corresponding to the planes of symmetry in the holohedral forms (see p. 420). In this way only can the symmetry of the hexagonal forms be clearly brought out, and at the same"], [429, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 411 time the relation between the hexagonal and tetragonal systems exhibited. Recently Groth (Tsch. Min. Mitth., 1874, 223, and Phys. Kryst., 1876, p. 252) has shown that the complete symbols of Weiss and Naumann could be translated into a reciprocal, integral form after the manner of Miller. The symbols then obtained, as was also shown, admit of a like con venient use in calculation. Essentially the same method was proposed in 1866 by Bravais, and his suggestion is followed here ; the more important equations, expressing the relations between the poles of the planes, their indices, and the axes of the crystal are also added. They are given somewhat in detail, since they are not included in any of the works on Miller's System before referred to. All hexagonal forms are referred to a vertical axis, I:, and three equal lateral axes in a plane at right angles to it, intersecting at angles of 60 J and 120\" (f. 792). The general symbol for a plane in this system is (hkli), where it is always true that the alge braic sum of h, k, I is zero, that is, h + k + I = 0. The indices here are the reciprocals of those of Naumann, except that the index I has the opposite sign, and the order of two of the indices is inverted. According to him the general symbol of any plane is m-n (=mPn), or, in full, a : a : na : me. Thus the plane 3-1 (3PJ) re-1 has the full symbol, 3a : a : fa : 3c, or to correspond with the other symbols it must be written, 3a : \\a : a : 3c. The reciprocals of the latter indices are \\ : \u00a3 : 1 : J, or, reduced to integers (and changing the sign of I) (1231), which is the symbol according to the plan here fol lowed. Similarly the plane (2243) gives, on taking the reciprocals, \\a : \\a : $a : \\c. which is equivalent to 2a : 2a : a: \\c. or in Naumann's abbreviated form i-2 (=4P2). It is the great advantage of this method that it makes it possible to change the almost uni- versally adopted symbols of Weiss and Naumann into a form which allow of all the readiness of calculation and the appli cation to the spherical projection which are the characteristics of Miller's System. In calculations, both by zone equations and other methods, only two of the indices ., k, or . of the form (hkli) need be employed, with the remaining index i (re ferring to the vertical axis). This is ob viously true, since the three indices named are connected by the equation h + k + I = 0. Disregarding, then, in calculation the third index I, as shown beyond, the planes are referred to two equal lateral axes, intersecting at an angle of 120J, and a third vertical axis _. The symbol [hkli] in its more gen eral form embraces twenty-four planes, as is evident from an inspection of the spherical projection, f. 793. Here A, k, I are of equal value and mutually exchange able, with the condition, however, that their algebraic sum shall always equal zero. Of the twenty-four planes of the dihexa^onal pyramid, the following are those of the upper quadrants mentioned in order from left to right around the circle (f . 793). Those below have the same symbols, except that the index . in each case is minus : (Ikhi) (lhki\\ (klili) (Ikhi) (Ihki) (khli) (hkli) (hlki) (Md) (hkli) (hlki) (klhi) In this general form [hkli] the following special cases are possible, each one giving rise to an independent form or group of forms, as seen below :"], [430, "412 APPENDIX.

In the Hexagonal System, as has been explained, the symbol in general has the form [hkli], where the algebraic sum of h, h, and I is zero. This general symbol has four in- dices,^ referring respectively to the three equal lateral axes and the vertical axis, as shown in f. 1 92, thus showing the fundamental hexagonal symmetry of the forms. Since, however the position of a plane is known by its intersection with three axes aione, two of' the three indices h, k, I are all that are needed in calculation, the third, ., being a function, as given above, of h and k. The mathematical relations of the planes in this system are brought out by referring them to three axes, viz., two equal lateral axes H, K, (= a = 1) oblique (120\" and 60 ) to one another, and a third axis (a) of unequal length perpendicular to their plane. This applies also to the calculation by zonal equations. The indices (u, v, w) of the zone in which the planes (hkli), (pqrt) lie, are given by the scheme : h k i h k XXX p q t p q u = kt \u2014 qi v = ip \u2014 ht w = hq \u2014 kp.

This general symbol then embraces the following planes : (hkl) (hkl) (kht) (hkl) (hkl) (hkl) (hkl) (hkl) As different values are given to h, k, I, this general form becomes more or less specialized. The possible forms are as follows : ([Mil] ; h>k. 1. \\ [hkl] ; h>k. [[hhl] ; h = k. 2. [Oki ] ; k = 0. 3. [7/0.] ; h = 0. s [7*7(0]; i = 0, A>\u00c6. 4. -{ [7(70] ; . = 0, h>k. I [110] ; ft = k = l, 1 = 0. 5. [010] ; 7. = . = 0. 6. [100] ; fc *= . = 0. 7. [001] ; h = k = 0. nb : a : me [m-?l]. b : na : me [tn-ii]. b :_d : me [m]. cob : a : me [m-i], 6 : co a : me, [m-i] . b: a : cce [i-n], b : nil : oo c [i-n], b :_ni : ooc [/]. co b : a : oo 6 [*-*]\u2022 b :_oo d : oo c [i-i]. ccb : cod : a [0]. These symbols belong to the various distinct forms of this system, as follows : Pinacoids. \u2014 (a) Basal plane. Symbol [001], including the two planes (001) and (00T). (7>) Macropinacoid. Symbol [010] , including the plane (010), and (010) opposite to it. (c) Brachy pinacoid. Symbol [100], including the planes (100) and (100). Prisms.\u2014 (a) Unit prism (/). Symbol 110, including four planes, (110), (110), (110), (110). (.) Macrodiagonal and brachy diagonal prisms, having respectively the symbols [7*7(0] and [M0], if h is greater than k. Thus the symbol i-2 corresponds to [120], and i-i to [210]. Domes. \u2014 (a) Macrodiagonal, or macro domes, having the symbol [Oki] ; and (b) brachydiagonal, or brachydomes, with the symbol [7(07]. In each case the symbol embraces four similar planes. Octahedrons or Pyramids. \u2014 The symbol [7(7(7] belongs to the eight planes of the unit pyramids, all lying in the zone between the unit prism [110], and the base [001]. If h = 7 the form is then [111] and the_ eight planes are_:_ (111)^ (111), (ill), (Hi), (ill), (111), (III), (ill). Of the general pyramids two cases are possible, either [khl] or [hkl] , when h > k, these correspond respectively to the prisms [khO] and [7(7.0]. They are the macrodi agonal and brachydiagonal pyramids of Naumann ; thus 2-2 (= 2b : a : 2 '\u25a0) is [121], according to Miller, and 2-2 (= b : 2u : 2c) is [211] * The same lettering is employed here as in the early part of this work ; it differs from that of Miller in that with him a is the macrodiaganal, and Ti the brachydiagonal axis. Following the method of the other systems, the macropinacoid should have the symbol (100), and the brachypinacoid (010). like the clinopinacoid of the Monoclinic System. It is considered best at present, however, to follow Miller, as his notation is nearly universally accepted. This, however, makes it necessary to write the formulas after Naumann, b : na : me, etc., thus showing that the letter h refers to the axis b, contrary to the usage in the other systems. It is to be noticed also that the front plane, as the crystals are usually drawn, is (010). This is, to be sure always the case with Miller, but other authorities make the same plane in the monoclinic and triclinic systems (100), so that entire uniformity is in no case possible."], [434, "416 APPENDIX. For the figures of the above-mentioned forms see pp. 42-44. Their relations will be under stood from an examination of f. 801, showing the projection of the crystal in f. 758, p. 402. It will be seen that all the macrodiagonal planes lie between the zonal circles (diameters) (110) (001), and (010) (001), and the brachydiagonal planes between (110) (001) and (100) (001). Mathematical Relations of the Orthorhombic System. (1) For the distance between the pole of any plane P(hkl) and the pinacoid planes we have in general : cos8 PA = cos (hkl) (100) = aw+S% + Pa,ft. cos2 PB = cos (hkl) (010) = AW+%a% + iw Pb2c2 cos8 PC = cos (hkl) (001) = ,., ., ., r^n Tr****-***-** ' v ' h'a'c2 + k'b'c2 + Pa'o2 ha he cot PX = -\u2014 cos PXY = -=- cos PXZ. kb lb Furthermore : (2) For the distance (PQ) between the poles of any two planes (hkl) and (pqr) : \u201e\u201e hpa2c2 + kqb'c2 + lra2b2 cos PQ = y J . \u25a0d[li'a2c2 + k'b'c2 + Pa2b2] [p2a'c2 + q'b'c2 + r2a2b2] (3) For planes lying in a zone, the general relation (p. 404) is to be employed. For the special cases, practically of most importance, the simplified equations which follow are used. (4) To determine the lengths of the axes, the general equation may be employed : -= cos PA = -- cos PB = X cos PC. h k I Here PA, PB, PC are the distances from the pole of any plane (hkl) to the pinacoid planes (100), (010), (001) respectively. The brachydiagonal axis, ii, is made the unit. If the angle between any dome or prism and the adjoining pinacoid plane is given, the rela tions follow immediately : bk tan PA = tan (7ikO) (100) = -r dfl tan PB = tan (07:7) (010) = 7- CK ch tan PC = tan (AOZ) (001) = *=r V. Monoclinic System. In the Monoclinic System there are three unequal axes, and one of these makes an oblique angle with a second. The axes are lettered as shown in f. 803. \u201e\u201e0 . is vertical, b the orthodiagonal axis, and . the clinodiagonal axis oblique to i; but at right angles to b. The symbol [hkl] embraces only four similar planes in the most general case, for in consequence of the obliquity of one of the axes, the quadrants above in front correspond alone to those below and behind, and those above behind correspond to those below in front. This is seen clearly in the projection of f. 803. For \u00b1h, \u00b1i_, \u00b11 the symbol [7(7:7] includes two distinct forms, viz. : (1) (M7) (AU) (hkl) (hkl) and (2) (hkl) (hkl) (hkl) (hhl) The various forma are as follows :"], [435, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 417 Pinncoids.\u2014 Base [001]. Orthopinacoid [100]. Clinopinacoid [010]. Each symbol of oourse, comprehending two planes only. 804 Crocoite. Prisms.\u2014 (a) Unit prism [110], = d : b : co i (I) of Naumann. This symbol embraces four similar prismatic planes, (b) Orthodiagonal prisms [hkO], where A > k, the poles of these pri-ms fall on the prismatic zonal circle between 100 and 110 (see f. 803). They correspond to the prisms i-n (= d : nb : co c) of Naumann. (c) Clinodiagonal prisms. Symbol [M0], h > k, lying between (110) and (010). They correspond to i-h (=nd : b : oo .) of Naumann. Domes. \u2014 (as) Hemi-orthodomes, including two cases, (101) and (101), the minus domes of Naumann (opposite the obtuse angle) ; and also (101) and (101)), the plus domes of Naumann (opposite the acute angle j8). (b) Clinodomes. Symbol [Oki], embracing four similar planes (Oki) (Oki), (Oki), (Oki). The clinodome [011], equivalent to 1-i (=cod : b : mi), is one case in this form. Pyramids. \u2014 The pyramids are all hemi-pyramids. (a) The symbol [7(7(7] includes the unit pyramids in a zone between [110] and [001]. (b) The symbol [7(7:7] includes two sets of hemi pyramids, whose indices have been given on p. 416, corresponding respectively to \u2014 P and +P of Naumann. If A is greater than k these are orthodiagonal pyramids, corresponding to \u00b1 (d : nb : cc i) of Naumann. The symbol [M(7] on the same supposition includes two sets of planes, like those of p. 416, and differing only in being clinodiagonal ; equivalent to (nd : b : co c) of Naumann. The orthodiagonal planes lie between the zone (100), (001) and (110), (001), while the clino diagonal are between the latter zone and (010) (001), as is seen on f. 803, which gives the projection for f. 804. Mathematical Relations for the Monoclinic System. (1) The distances of the pole of any plane (hkl) from the pinacoid planes are given by the following equations : hbc + lab cos $ cos PA = cos (hkl) (100) = . =- **= ; K ' ' s/h'b'c2 + k'ePc2 sin2 $ + Pa'b2 + 2hlab'c cos j8 kac sin 0 cos PB = cos (7(7:7) (010 = .,\u2014 _ __ = \u25a0=__ : \u2014 ; Vh2b2c2 + k2a2c2 sin8 0 + Pa2b2 + 2hlab2c cos 0 \u201e\u201e., lab + hbc cos H cos PC = cos (hkl) (001) = .-- . .

(2) The distance between any two planes may be expressed in general form, but in all practically arising cases the end can be attained by the solution of one or more spherical tri angles on the projection. (3) For the relation between the planes in a zone the general equation before given holds good : cot PS - cot PR _ (PQ). (SR) cot PQ - cot PR ~~ (QR) . (PS)' (4) For all zones passing through the clinopinacoid (010), the value of PR may be taken as 90\u00b0, and the above equation consequently simplified : A _ k tan PB _ _7_ p ~ q tan QB \u2014 r This equation is especially valuable for determining the indices of planes in the prismatic and clinodome series. (5) To determine the axial relations the general equation admits of being transformed so as to read : A sin PYA _ p^ sin QYA _ _ T ' sinPYC ~ V ' sin QYC ~ _ ' k sin PYA _ q sin^QYA _ b_ T \u25a0 Xot PY ~ ~r ' cotQY \u2014 e and The angles PYA , PYC are angles which may be calculated directly by spherical triangles from the measured angles. Similarly for QYA, QYC. PY and QY are the angles between the given plane P or Q with the clinopinacoid. VI. Triclinic System. In the Triclinic System, since the axes are imequal and all mutually oblique, there can be no plane of symmetry, and there can in no case be more than two planes included in a single form._ The three axes are distinguished as a vertical, c, a longer lateral, or macrodiagonal axis, . , and a shorter lateral, or brachydiagonal axis, a. The position assumed for the axes is shown in f. 259, p. 80. The general s3'inbol [AA*7] , which includes eight similar planes in the orthorhombic system, is here resolved into four independent forms, embracing two opposite planes only. They are thus : m (hkl) f9, (hkl) ,\u201e (hkl) ... (hkl) (1) (MT) W (hkl) W <m) d) (te) These correspond respectively to mP'n (1), m'Vn (2), mV,n (3), m,Vn (4) of Naumann, oi \u2014m-n', \u2014m-n, m-ii ', m-n', as the abbreviated symbols are written in the earlier part of this work. Contrary to the usage in the orthorhombic system, it is customary to make [100] the macropinacoid (i-i = a : cob : xr), and [010] the brachypinacoid (i-i = ood : 7> : \u0153e). Planes having the symbol [7(07] are then macrodomes; and those of the symbol [Oki] are brachy domes. Similarly then pyramids (A > k) of the form [7(7:7] are macrodiagonal planes, and those of the form (hkl) are brachydiagonal planes. The unit prism consists of two independent forms (110), (110) (I'=ooP,'), and (110), (110) (I =oo',P). Mathematical Relations of the Triclinic System. In consequence of the obliquity of the axes in the Triclinic System the mathematical rela tions are less simple, and the general equations deduced as before become so complicated as to be seldom of much practical value. Most problems which arise may be solved by the zonal relations, or by the solution of the spherical triangles in the projection. Some of the most important relations (given by Schrauf) are as follows :"], [437, "MILLER'S SYSTEM OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 419 If the angle between the axes X and Z = ., between X and Y = f, and between Y and Z = { (see f. 759) ; if also a, 0, y are the corresponding angles between the pinacoid planes \u2014 then : cos 0 cos 7 \u2014 cos o cos 7 cos a \u2014 cos 0 cos 0 cos a = cos y COS \u00a3 = : \u2014 .

Relations op the Six Crystalline Systems in Respect to Symmetry. From a careful study of the spherical projections for the successive systems a very clear idea may be obtained of the degree of symmetry which characterizes each. It is well under stood that in the Isometric System there are nine planes of symmetry ; in the Tetragonal, five; in the Hexagonal, seven ; in the Orthorhombic, three; and in the Monoclinic only one. These relations are shown on the projections by the symmetrical distribution of the poles about the respective great circles. These zone-circles of sj-mmetry are as follows : Isometric System (f. 766) : 1st, the three diametral zones : 1. (100), (010), (100). 2. (100), (001), (100). 3. (010), (001), (010).

The following projection (f. 800) is added in order to show the relation of the forms in the Hexagonal and Rhombohedral Systems as referred to the three equal oblique axes of Miller. The forms are as follows : The planes having the indices (100), (010), (001) are those of the (plus) funda- mental rhombohedron. while the plane (111) is the base. The planes (221). (121), (122) are those of the minus fundamental rhombohedron ; with the planes (100), (010), (001) they form the unit hexagonal pyramid. The hexagonal unit prism (1= [0110]) \u2022has the symbols : (211), (121). (112), (211), (121), (112). The second, or diagonal hexa- gonal prism (7-2= [1120]) has the symbols : (101). (110), (011), (101), (110), (011). The dihexagonal pyramid embraces, like the simple hexagonal pyramid, two forms, [hkl] and [efg] ; the symbol [hkl] hence belongs to the plus sealenohedron, \u25a0md itfff] to the minus. In this as in other cases it is true that : e = \u2014 h + 2k + 21, f = 2h-k + 37, g = 2A + 2k - I. The dihexagonal prism includes the six planes of the form [hkO] , and the remain- ing six of the form [efO]. Most of the problems arising under this system can be solved by the zone equations, or by the working out of the spherical triangles on the sphere of projection."], [439, "APPENDIX B. ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. In the projection of crystals, the eye is supposed to be at an infinite distance, so that the rays of light fall from it on the crystal in parallel lines. The plane on which the crystal is projected is termed the plane of projection. This plane may be at right angles to the ver tical axis, may pass through the vertical axis, or may intersect it at an oblique angle. These different positions give rise, respectively, to the horizontal, vertical, and oblique pro jections. The rays of light may fall perpendicularly on the plane of projection, or may be obliquely inclined to it ; in the former case the projection is termed orthographic, in the second clinographic. In the horizontal position of the plane of projection, the projection is always orthographic. In the other positions, it may be either orthographic or dinographic. It is generally preferable to employ the vertical position and clinographic projection, and this method is elucidated in the following pages. Projection op toe Axes. The projection of the axes of a crystal is the first step preliminary to the projection of the form of the crystal itself. The projection of the axes in the isometric system, which are equal and intersect at right angles, is here first given. The projection of the axes in the other systems, with the exception of the hexagonal, may be obtained by varying the lengths of the projected isometric axes, and also, when oblique, their inclinations, as shown beyond. Isometric System. \u2014 When the eye is directly in front of a face of a cube, neither the sides nor top of the crystal are visible, nor the planes that may be situated on the intermediate edges. On turning the crystal a few degrees from right to left, a side lateral plane is brought in view, and by elevating the eye slightly, the terminal plane becomes apparent. In the following demonstration, the angle of revolution is designated 5, and the angle of the ele vation of the eye, e. Fig.\"807 represents the normal position of the horizontal axes, supposing the eye to be in the direc tion of the axis BB ; BB is seen as a mere point, while CC appears of its actual length. On revolving the whole through a number of degrees equal to BMB' (5) the axes have the position exhibited in the dotted lines. The projection of' the semiaxis MB is now lengthened to MN, and that of the semi axis MC is shortened to MH. If the eye be elevated (at any angle, e), the lines B'N, BM, and CH will be projected respectively below N, M, and H. and the lengths of these projections (which we may designate J'N, JM, and c'H) will be di rectly proportional to the lengths of the lines B N, BM, and CH. It is usual to adopt such a revolution and such an elevation of the eye as may be expressed by a simple ratio between the projected axes The ratio between the two axes, MN : MH, as projected after the revolution, is designated by 1 : r; and the ratio of i'N to MN by 1 : s. Suppose T to equal 3 and s to equal 2, then proceed as follows :"], [440, "422 APPENDIX. Draw two lines AA', H'H (f. 808), intersecting one another at right angles. Make MH n- MH = b.

Divide HH into 3 (r) parts, and through the points, N, N', thus determined, draw perpendiculars to HH. On the left hand vertical, set off, below H , a part H'R, equal to - b = \u2014 HI ; and from R draw RM, and extend the same to the vertical N'. BB is the pro jection of the front horizontal axis. Draw BS parallel with MH and connect SM. From H the point T in which SM intersects BN, draw TC par c allel with MH. A line (CC) drawn from C through M, and extended to the left vertical, is the projection of the \u2022q side horizontal axis. Lay off on the right vertical, a part HQ equal to r MH, and make MA = MA'= MQ ; AA' is the vertical o axis. If, as here, r = 3, and s = 2, then 5 = 18\u00b0 26', and e = 9 28', for cot S = r, and cot e = rs. Tetragonal and Orthorhombic Systems. \u2014 The axes AA', CC, BB. constructed in the manner described, are equal and at right angles to each other. The projection of the axes of a tetra gonal crystal is obtained by simply laying off, with a scale of proportional parts, on MA and MA' taken as units, the value of the vertical axis (i) for the given species. Thus for zircon, where . = *04, we must lay off *64 of MA above M and the same length below. For an orthorhombic crystal, where the three axes are unequal, the length of i must as before be laid off above and below from M, and that of 7< to the right and left of M, on CC, MC being taken as the unit. It is usual to make the front axis MB = u = 1. Monoclinic System. \u2014 The axes i and d in the monoclinic system are inclined to one another at an obliqe angle = 0. To project this inclination, and thus adapt the isometric axes to a monoclinic form, lay off (f. 809) on the axis MA, M\u00ab = MA cos 0, and on the axis BB' (before or behind M, according as the inclination of d on _, in front, is acute or obtuse) Mb = MB x sin 0. From the points 7> and a, draw lines parallel respectively with the axes AA and BB', and from their intersection D , draw through M, D D, making MD = MD'. The line DD' is the clinodiagonal, and the lines AA, CC, DD re present the axes in a monoclinic solid in which a = b = c = 1 . The points a and 7< and the position of the axis DD' will vary with the angle 0. The relative values of the axes may be given them as above explained; that is, if d = 1, lay off in the direction of MA and MA a line equal to c, and in the direction of MC and MC a line equal to b, etc. 'Triclinic System. \u2014 The vertical sections through the horizontal axes in the triclinic system are obliquely in clined ; also the inclination of the axis a to each axis 7> 809 and c, is oblique. In the adaptation of the isometric axes to the triclinic forms, it is there \u201e.\u201e fore necessary, in the first place, to give the requisite *^-.Tr t-r\\ \"H-i***-* rmifnil *i*n_->l trtif i.mi i-*_*r + H __\u00bb TT__.*r>J--i nnl \u00a3\u25a0_}-*\"*. obliquity to the mutual inclination of the vertical sec tions, and afterwards to adapt the horizontal axes. The inclination of these sections we may designate A, and as heretofore, the angle between a and b, y, and a and c, si. BB' is the analogue of the brachydiagonal, and CC of the maerodiagonal. An oblique inclination may be given the vertical sections, by varying the position of either of these sections. Permitting the brachydiagonal section ABA B to remain unaltered, we may vary the other sec tion as follows : Lay off (f. 810) on MB, M. = MB x cos A, and on the axis C C (to the right or left of M, according as the acute angle A is to the right or left), Me = MC x sin A ; completing the parallelogram M7i Do, and drawing the diagonal MD, extending the same to D' so as to make MD' \u2014 MD, we obtain the line DD' ; the vertical section"], [441, "ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. 423 passing through this line is the correct maerodiagonal section. The inclination of a to the new maerodiagonal DD' is still a right angle ; as also the inclination of a to *, their oblique inclinations may be given them as follows: Lay off on MA (f. 809), Ma = MA x cos 0, and on the axis BB (brachydiagonal), Mi = MB' x sin j3. By completing the parallelogram Ma, E'*, the point E' is determined. Make ME = ME; EE is the projected brachydiagonal. Again lay off on MA, Ma'= MA x cos a. and on MD', to the left, lid = MD' x sin a. Draw lines from a' and d parallel to MD and MA ; F', the intersection of these lines, is one extremity of the maerodiagonal; and the line FF , in which MF = MF', is the maerodiagonal. The vertical axis AA' and the horizontal axes EE' (brachydiagonal) and FF' (maerodiagonal) thus obtained, are the axes in a triclinic form, in which a = b = c = 1. Different values may be given these axes, according to the method heretofore illustrated. Hexagonal System. \u2014 In this system there are three equal horizontal axes, at right angles to the vertical axis. The normal position of the horizontal axes is represented in f. 811. The eye, placed in the line of the axis YY, observes two of the semiaxes, MZ and MU, projected in the same straight line, while the third, MY, appears a mere point. To give the axes a more eligible position for a representation of the various planes on the solid, we revolve them from r.ght to left through a certain number of degrees S, and elevate the eye at an angle e. The dotted lines in the figure repre sent the axts in their new situation, resulting from a revolution through a number of degrees equal to 5 = YMY'. In this position the axis MY is projected upon MP, MU upon MS, and MZ on MH. Dtsguating the intermediate axis I. that to the right II, that to the lel't III, if the revolution is suc.i as to give the projections of I and II the ratio of 1 : 2, the relations of ihe three projectkns will be as follows : I : II : III = 1:2:3. Let us take r (= PM : HM) equal to 3, and s (= b'P : PM) equal to 2, these being the most convenient ratios for representing the hexagonal crystalline forms. The following will be the mode of construc tion : 1. Draw the lines AA, HII (f. 812) at right angles with, and bisecting, each other. Let HM = b, or HH = 2b. Divide HH into six parts by vertical lines. These lines, including the left- and right-hand verticals, may be numbered from one to six, as in the figure. In the first vertical, below H, lay off HS = lb, and from S draw a line through M to the fourth vertical. YY is the projection of the axis I. 2. From Y draw a line to the sixth vertical and parallel with HH. From T, the extremity of this line, draw a line to N in the second vertical. Then from the point U, in which TN intersects the fifth vertical, draw a line through M to the second vertical ; UU\" is the projection of the axis II. 3. From R, where TN intersects the third verti cal, draw RZ to the first vertical parallel with HH. Then from Z draw a line through M to the sixth vertical ; this line ZZ' is the projection of the axis III. 4. For the vertical axis, lay off from N on the sec ond vertical (f. 812) a line of any length, and con struct upon this line an equilateral triangle ; one side (NQ. of this triangle will intersect the first vertical at a distance, HV, from H, corresponding to __ H in f. 811; for in the triangle NH V, the angle HNV is an angle of 30\u00b0, and HN = _MH. MV is therefore the radius of the circle (f. 811). Make therefore MA = MA'= MV ; AA' is the vertical axis, and YY', UU\", ZZ are the projected horizontal axes. The vertical axis has been constructed equal to the horizontal axes. Its actual length in different hexagonal or rhombohedral forms may be laid off according to the method sufficiently explained. , , , The projection of the isometric and hexagonal axes, having been once accurately made, and that on a conveniently large scale, may be kept on a piece of cardboard, and will then answer all subsequent requirements. Whenever needed for use, these axes may be transferred to a sheet of paper, and then adapted in length, or inclination, or both, to the case m hand."], [442, "424 APPENDIX. Projection of the Forms of Crystals. 1. Simple forms. \u2014 When the axial cross has been constructed for the given species, the unit octahedron is obtained at once by joining the extremities of the axes, AA', BB , CC, as in f. 813. Here as in all cases the lines which fall in front are drawn strongly, while those behind are simply dotted. For the diametral prisms draw through B, B', C, C, of the projected axes of any species, lines parallel to the axes BB , CC, until they meet ; they make the parallelogram, abed, which is a transverse section of the prism, par allel to the base. Through a, b, c, d draw lines parallel and equal to the vertical axis, making the parts above and below these points equal to the vertical semiaxis. Then, connect the extremities of these lines by lines parallel to ab, be, ed, da, and the figure will be that of the diametral prism, corresponding to the axes projected. In the case of the isometric system this dia- metral prism is the cube, whose faces are represented by the letter //; in the tetragonal system it is the prism 0,7-7; in the orthorhombic, the prism 0, i-i, i-i ; in the monoclinic, the prism 0, i-i. i-i ; in the triclinic, 0, i-i, i-i. The unit vertical prism in the tetragonal, orthorhombic, and clinometnc systems may be projected by drawing lines parallel to the vertical axis AA' through B, C, B'. C, making the parts above and below these points equal to the vertical semiaxis ; and then connecting the extremities of these lines bylines parallel to BC, CB', BC, C B. The plane BCBC isa transverse section of such a prism parallel to its base. It is the prism 0, I, in each of the systems excepting the triclinic, and in that 0, 1,1'; a square prism in the tetragonal system ; a right rhombic in the orthorhombic; an oblique rhombic in the monoclinic ; an oblique rhom boidal in the triclinic. Other simple forms under the different systems are constructed in essentially the same way. It is only necessary to lay down upon the axes each plane of the form, in lightly drawn lines, note the points where it intersects the adjoining planes, and draw these in more strongly. When the process is complete the construction lines may be erased. The process will be illustrated by f . 814 and f. 815. In the former case it is required to draw the trigonal trisoe tahedron, whose symbol is 2."], [443, "425 ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. In f. 814 the three planes of the first octant are represented, they are 2:1:1,1:2:1, and 1:1:2. It will be seen here, what is always true, that the two points of intersection required to determine the line of intersection, lie in the axial planes. These lines of intersec tion are represented by the dotted lines in f. 814. If the same process be performed for the other octants, the complete form, as in f. 816, will be obtained. Similarly in f. 815, the octagonal pyramid 1-2 is constructed ; the figure shows the planes of one octant only, i : 2a : a, and i : a : 2a, and the dotted line gives their liije of intersec tion. Carry out the same plane of construction in the other octants, and the form of f. 817 will result. The construction of the various crystalline forms, by this method, especially those of the isometric system, will be found an interesting and instructive process, and will lead to a clear understanding of the forms themselves and their relations to each other. Another and quicker, though more mechanical method of constructing the isometric forms may also be given. Projection of Simple Isometric Forms. \u2014 This method depends upon the principle that in the different isometric forms the vertices of the solid angles are occupied by one or more of the interaxes (p. 16). If, therefore, these points (the extremities of the interaxes), can be deter mined in the several crystalline forms, it is only necessary to connect them in order to obtain the projection of the solid itself. As a preparation for the construction of figures of isometric crystals, it is desirable to have at hand the figure of a cube projected on a large scale, with its axes, and its trigonal (octahe dral), and rhombic (dodecahedral) interaxes. The values of the interaxes t and r, for a given form, are obtained by adding to their nor mal length the values of t' and r respectively given by the following equations ; those of the octahedron being taken as a unit : 2mn \u2014 (m + n) , n \u2014 1 inn + (m + n) ~ n + 1 ' The proportion to be added to the interaxes for some of the common forms is as follows : t r t r 2 _- 0 .-2 1 J . i 0 i-3 f -. S-| i i 2-2 i i 4-2 f J- 3-3 i i To construct the form 4-2, the octahedron is first to be projected, and its axes and inter axes drawn. Then add to each half of each trigonal interaxis, five-sevenths of its length ; and to each half of each rhombic interaxis, one-third of its length. The extremities of the lines thus extended are situated in the vertices of the solid angles of the hexoctahedron 4-2, and by connecting them, the projection of this form is completed. In the inclined hemihedral isometric forms (p. 20), the rhombic interaxes do not terminate in the vertices of the solid angles, and may therefore be thrown out of view in the projection of these solids. The two halves of each trigonal interaxis terminate in the vertices of dis similar angles, and are of unequal lengths. One is identical with the corresponding interaxis in the holohedral forms, and is called the holohedral portion of the interaxis ; the other is the hemihedral portion. The length of the latter may be determined by adding to the half of the octahedral interaxis that portion of the same indicated in the formula : 2m n \u2014 (m \u2014 n) mn + (m \u2014 n) ' If the different halves of the trigonal interaxes be assumed at one time, as the holohedral, (m-n) (m-n) ... and again as the hemihedral portion, the reverse forms -jr\u2014 and \u2014 may be projected. The following table contains the values cf the above fraction for several of the inclined hemihedral forms, and also the corresponding values for the holohedral portion of the inter axis : Hoi. interax. Hem. interax. Hoi. interax. Hem. interax, {-^- (f. 76, p. 20) 0 2 *\u2014 (f. 85) i 1 =^-}(f. 81) i 2 i \\ \u25a0i ** m i a \u00a39 si 2 2"], [444, "426 APPENDIX. The parallel hemihedrons (for example, the pentagonal dodecahedron, or hemi-tetrahexahe dron) contain a solid angle, situated in a line between the extremities of each pair of semiaxes, which is called an unsymmetrical solid angle. The vertices of these angles are at unequal distances from the two adjacent axes, and therefore are not in the line of the rhombic inter axes. The co-ordinates of this solid angle for any form, as - - , may be found by the for mulas _!_______-__ and \u2014 -. By means of these formulas, the situation of two points, a mn-1 mn \u2014 1 and . (f. 818), in each of the axes may be determined : and if lines are drawn through a and b in each semiaxis parallel to the other axes, the intersections c c , of these lines will be the [m-n] vertices of the unsymmetrical solid angles, those marked . of the form \u2014 = \u2014 and those marked [m-n] c of the form = \u2014 -j The trigonal interaxes are of the same length as in the holohedral forms. The values of these interaxes, and of the coordinates of the unsymmetrical solid angle for different parallel hemihedrons, are contained in the following table : Trigonal Coord, of the Trigonal Coord, of the interaxis. unsym.

Y^I (f. 9a) 111 Projection of a Rhombohedron. \u2014 To construct a rhombohedron, lay off verticals through the extremities of the horizontal axes, and make the parts both above and below these extremities equal to the third of the vertical semiaxis (f. 819). The points E, E, E . E, etc., are thus determined ; and if the extremities of the vertical axis be connected with the points E or E , rhombohedrons in different positions, i\u00bb.R, or -mR, will be constructed. Scalenohedron. \u2014 The scalenohedron m\" admits of a similar construction with the rhombohe dron mR. The only variation required, is to multiply the vertical axis by the number of units in n, after the points E and E in the rhombohedron i\u00bbR have been determined ; then connect the points E, or the points E , with one another and with the extremities of the ver tical axis. 2. Complex Forms. \u2014 When it is required to figure not only the planes of one form, that is, those embraced in one symbol, but also those of a number modifying one another, a some what different process is found desirable. It is possible indeed to construct a complex form in the way mentioned on p. 424, each plane being laid off on the given axes, and its intersec tion-edges with adjoining planes determined by two points, always in the axial sections, which it has in common with each. In this way. however, the figure will soon become so complex as to be extremely perplexing, and thus lead to error and consequent loss of time. This difficulty is in part avoided by the use of one projection of the axes on a larger scale, upon which the directions of the intersection-lines are determined, while a second smaller one,"], [445, "427 ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. placed below and parallel to it on the same sheet of paper, is used for the actual drawing of the crystal. In most cases, however, the crystal may be drawn as conveniently without the use of the second set of axes. The size of the figure may be either that which is to be finally required, or, more advantageously, it maybe drawn two or three times larger and then reduced by photography. This method is especially to be recommended when the figures are finally to be engraved on wood, since from the enlarged drawing they may be photographed directly upon the wood of any required size, and thus a very high degree of accuracy attained. Application os Quenstedt's Projection. \u2014 the process of determining the direction of the intersection-edges is much simplified if the principles of Quenstedt's Projection (p. 55) are made use of. In other words, the symbol of every plane is so transformed that for it th_ length of the vertical axis is unity. This extremity of the vertical axis is then one point of intersection for all planes whatsoever, and the second point will always lie in the horizontal plane, that of the lateral axes. The change in the symbol requires nothing but that the symbol, expressed in full, should be divided by the coefficient of the vertical axis. The direc tion of each intersection-edge, when determined, is transferred to the figure in process of construction by means of a small triangle sliding against a ruler some 8 inches in length. It will be found in practice that, especially when this method is employed, it is not necessary to actually draw all the lines representing each plane, but to note simply the required points of intersection. This method and its advantages (see Klein, Einleitung in die Krystallberech nung, II., p. 387) will be made clear by an example. It is required to project a crystal of andalusite of prismatic habit, showing also the planes i-_, i-i, 1-i, 1, 2-2, 1-i, and 0. It is evident that an indefinite number of figures may be made, including the planes men tioned, and yet of very different appearance according to the relative size of each. It is usually desirable, however, to represent the actual appearance of the crystal in nature, only in ideal symmetry, hence it is very important in all cases to have a sketch of the crystal to be represented, showing the relative development of the different planes. If this sketch is made with a little care, so as to show also the parallelism of the intersection-edges in the occurring zones, it will give material aid. The zones, it is to be noted, are a great help in drawing figures of crystals, and they should be carefully studied, since the common direction of the intersection-edge once determined for any two planes in it, will answer for all others. The first step is to take the projection of the isometric axes already made once far all on a conveniently large scale, and which, as before suggested, is kept on a card of large size, and ready to be pierced through on to the paper employed These axes, now of equal length, must be adapted to the species in hand. For andalusite the axial ratio is e : b : \u00ab = 0 712 F014 1 * hence the vertical axis i must have a length -71 of what it now has, and the lateral axis one l'*01 * these required lengths are determined in a moment with a scale of equal parts. The next step is to draw the predominating form, the prism /. Obviously its intersection edges are parallel to the vertical axis, and its basal edges, intersecting 0, are parallel to ps, Z m__ the projection (f. 820). The planes i-l, and i* '1 are now to be added, whose intersections wit\" eachTthe and with I are parallel to i. The position of one edge, / i-l, having been taken that of the other on the other side is determined by the point where a line parallel to"], [446, "428 APPENDIX. the axis I meets the basal edge of the pri. m. Similarly the position of the same prismatic edges behind are given by the intersection of lines from front to rear parallel to the axis a. The prisms drawn, it remains to add the terminal planes, and as they thus modify one an other's position, they are drawn together. The required intersection-lines are easily obtained. The macrodome l-( is the plane passing through the point . and intersecting the horizontal plane in the line paq ; this line is obviously the direction of its intersection-edge with i-i and with 0. The prism 7-2 appears (f. 820) as the two lines nun', n/i ; the line mm produced beyond m meets paq at z, this will be one common point for the two planes l-( and i-2; the second common point is, as always, the point ., hence the line joining these two points, trans ferred to the crystal in the way described, gives the required intersection-edge for 7-2 and 1-*. Similarly for 7-2 on the right, the two points of intersection are c, and the point where nil and rjap, produced, meet, and this gives the second intersection-edge. The planes \\-i and 1 (right) meet at d and c ; hence the line ed gives the direction of their in'ersection-edge, which is also the direction of that of 1-. and 1 (left), and of 1 and 2-2, right and left on both sides. Still again, the plane 2-_ has the full symbol 2 '* : 7> : 2 . . or 7* : W : ,i ; and hence intersects the horizontal plane (f. 820) in the lines as (right), at (left), and a'q, dp (behind). Hence the intersection-edge of 1, 2-2, 1-7 has the direction of the line joining the points c and _ (right), and similarly to the left and behind. The intersection-edge of 2-2 front, and 2-2 behind, has the direction of the line joining the points c and x (right) and c and y (left). The method of obtaining the intersection-edges of the planes will be clear from this ex- ample. Practical facility in drawing figures by this or any other \u00a721 method is only to be obtained by practice. It will be found that at almost every step there is an opportunity to test the accuracy of the work \u2014 thus every point of intersection on the basal plane behind must lie on a line drawn from the cor responding point in front on the basal plane, in the direction of the axis ,\"i ; so, too, the point of intersection of 2-2 and 1 (front), 2-2 ami 7 (behind), on one side, must be in the line of the horizontal axis (A) with that on the other side, and similarly in other cases. If it were required, as is generally necessary, to complete the form (f. 821) below, it is unnecessary to obtain any new intersec tion lines, since every line above has its corresponding line oppo site and parallel to it below. Moreover, in an orthorhombic crys tal every point above has a corresponding point below on a line parallel to the vertical axis. This, as above, will serve as a control of the accuracy of the work. There is another method of drawing complex crystalline forms which has many advantages and is sometimes to be preferred to any other ; it can be explained in a very few words. After the axes have been obtained the diametral prism is constructed upon them.

The plane 1 (_ : _> : a) may be laid'off on it by taking trom the angle a equal portions of the edges ., ., e, for instance, conveniently one"], [447, "429 ON THE DRAWING OF FIGURES OF CRYSTALS. half of each, hence the plane appears as mno. Again the plane 2 (2\" : b : a) is laid off by taking the unit lengths of the edges _ (b), and e (a) and twice the unit length of e (,'\u25a0), the plane is then mnb. Again, the plane 4-2 (47* : b : 2i) takes the position npb, since ap = 2c, ap = {b, and an = a, the ratio of the edges (axes) being the same as in the symbol. So also the plane 2-2 (2c : 27) : ,1) has the position rmo, since ao = 7*, am = b, and ar = \u25a0_*;, here, too, the ratio of the axes being preserved. By plotting the successive planes of the crystal in this way, each solid angle corresponding to an octant, the direction of the intersection-edges for the given form are at once obtained. For example, the intersection-edge for 1, and the basal plane, as also for 1 and 2, it is the line mn ; for 1 and 4-2 it is the dotted line joining the common points /( and a ; for 1 and 2-2 it is the line mo ; for 2 and 4-2, also for 2 and 2-2, it is the line joining the common points $a. The direction of the required intersection-edges being obtained in this way, they are used to construct the crystal itself, being transferred to it in the usual way. In f. 823 they have been placed upon the diametral prism, and when this process has been completed for the other angles, and, too, the domes .', . ', are added, the form in f. 824 results. On the Drawing of Twin Crystals. In order to project a compound or twinned crystal it is generally necessary to obtain first the axes of the second individual, or semi-individual, in the position in which they are brought by the revolution of 180 . This is accomplished in the following manner. In f. 825 a com pound crystal of staurolite is represented, in which twinning has taken place (1) on an axis normal to _-?, and (3) on an axis normal to f-f. The second, being the more general case, is of the greater importance for the sake of example. In f. 835, cc', _*. ', aa' represent the rect angular axes of staurolite (c = 1*441, b = 3*113, ,1 = 1). The twinning-plane J-J (fc : \u2014b : fa) has the position MNR. It is first necessary to construct a normal from the centre 0 to this plane. If perpendiculars be drawn from the centre O to the lines MN , NR. MR, they will meet them at the points X, y. z, dividing each line into segments proportional to the squares of the adjacent axes ;* or N\u00e6 : Mx = ON\" : OM2. In this way the points x, y, z are fixed, and lines * This is true since the axial angles are right angles. In the Monoclinic System two of the axial intersections are perpendicular, and they are sufficient to allow of the determina tion of the point T, as above. In the Triclinic System the method needs to be slightly modified."], [448, "430 APPENDIX. drawn from any two of them to the opposite angles R. N, or M will fix the point T. A line joining T and 0 is normal to the plane (MNR = f-3). Furthermore, it is obvious that if a revolution of 180 about TO take place, that every point in the plane MNR will remain equally distant from T. Thus, the point M will take the place = T/_), the point b' the place S' (NT =T/8'), and so on. The lines joining these points si, B , x, and the common centre O will be the new axes corresponding to MO, NO, RO. In order \" ' tn nbtn.in the unit _.ps norresT-irinrlino- to r. I,. ,1 it is mprplv npcpsenrv +r\u00bb to obtain the unit axes corresponding to i, b, a it is merely necessary to draw through . a line parallel to MT/i, meeting /aO at y, then 7O7' is the new vertical axis corresponding to <** 0. , also BOB corresponds to .07.', and aOa' corresponds to .Ort'. These three axes then are the axes for the second individual in its twinned position ; upon them, in the usual way, the new figure may be constructed and then transferred to its proper position with reference to the normal crystal. For the second method of twinning, when the axis is normal to f -i, the construction is more simple. It is obvious the axis is the line Ox, and using this, as before, the new axes are found ; kOk corresponds to cOc (sensibly coinciding with bbj, since 0 A f-_ = 134 31', and so on. In many cases the simplest method is to construct first the normal crystal, then draw through its centre the twinning-plane and the axis of revolution, and determine the angular points of the reversed crystal in the principle alluded to above : that by the revolution every point Calcite. remains at the same distance from the axis, measured in a plane at right angle to the axis. Thus in f. 837 when the scalenohedron has been drawn, since the twinning-plane is the basal plane, each angular point, by the revolution of 180\", obtains a position equidistant from this plane and directly below it. In this way eich angular point is determined, and the com pound crystal is completed in a moment."], [449, "II APPENDIX C. TABLES TO BE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF MINERALS. TABLE I.
