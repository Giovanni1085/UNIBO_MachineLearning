The expectations which have been excited in the minds of men by the prophecies contained in Scripture, and the hopes which have been roused by them, have eA^er invested Palestine Avith an exceptional interest to Biblical students ; while its sacred conditions, historical associations, and existing remains prove an attraction to crowds of pilgrims and tourists, who annually flock to the Holy Land. As, hoAvever, the impressions of a resi- dent and those of a visitor are apt to differ widely in regard to the conditions which actually exist there, and the former has opportunities of researches denied to the latter, I have ventured to think that a series of letters originally addressed to the New York Sun, and extend- ing over a period of three years passed in the country, might not be without interest to the general reader. Many of these will be found to deal chiefly with arch\u00e6o- logical subjects, \\Aahich must, indeed, form the main sub ject of attraction to any one living in the country, and conversant Avith its history. A flood of light has been throAvn of recent years upon its topography, its ancient sites, and the extensive ruins Avhich still exist, to testify to its once teeming popula tion, by the prolonged and valuable researches of the \" Palestine Exploration Fund \" of London."], [10, "IV PREFACE. As, however, these are embodied in volumes so ex pensive that they are beyond the reach of the general public, and are too technical in their character to suit the taste of the ordinary reader, I have in many instances endeavored to popularize them, aATailing myself extensive ly of the information that they contained, and quoting freely such passages as tended to the elucidation of the subject under consideration, more especially with regard to recent discovery at Jerusalem. The experience and investigation of the last three years, howeA^er, has only serATed to convince me that the field of research is far from being exhausted, and that, should the day ever come AA-hen excavation on a large scale is possible, the Holy Land will yield treasures of infinite interest and value, alike to the arch\u00e6ologist and the historian.

[This book has been copyrighted in America by Mr Dana, who has written the following Introduction to it. ] The chapters which compose this volume originally formed a series of letters, all of which passed through my hands. I prepared them for their first appearance in print, and corrected the proofs afterwards. Finally, it was at my suggestion and advice that they Avere gathered together in a book. The deep interest Avhich the land of Palestine possesses for every thoughtful mind makes us all greedy for fresh and truth ful information, alike concerning its present condition and the discoveries Avhich neAV researches add to our knowledge of the past. From this point of vieAV, many of the pages Avhich follow are of exceeding importance. Every Christian will read with deep attention the author's description of the present state of places connected with momentous events of New Testament history ; and when, as in the present instance, the traveller and investigator is one whose judgment and Avhose accuracy may be entirely- relied upon, the value of the report surpasses every careless estimate. It is Avith this feeling that I have urged my friend to com plete his work for publication, and Avith this feeling I earnestly commend it to the reader. Nor is its interest confined to historical and Biblical questions alone ; the ethnologist ex amining the races of modern Syria, and the philosopher con templating the marvellous processes of Asiatic transformation, will also find here material Avhich will repay their most care ful study.

Smyrna, Nov. 4, 1882. \u2014 There are two ways of doing Ephesus : you may either go there and, like the Apostle, \"fight with beasts,\" in the shape of donkeys and donkey boys, or you may wear yourself to death under the blazing sun, alternately scrambling over its rocks, and sinking ankle deep in the mire of its marshes. In old days it Avas an easy tAvo days' ride from Smyrna to Ephesus, the distance being about fifty miles, but the Smyrna and Aiden Railway speeds you to the ruins in about tAvo hours iioav, first through the romantic little gorge from whose rocky ledge rises the hill croAvned by the ruined castle which overlooks the town, past a modern and an ancient aqueduct, the latter moss-grown and picturesque, Avith its double sets of arches rising one above the other ; through orange and pomegranate groves, and vineyards -yellow and languishing at this season of the year from the drought ; across fertile plains from which the cereals and corn crops have been removed, and where flocks of sheep and goats are scattered on distant hill slopes, or folloAV in long lines the striking figures of the shepherds in their broad-shouldered felt coats ; past the black tents of the Yourouks, a nomadic tribe of Turcomans, whose kindred extend from here to the great wall of China, and Avho vary their pastoral operations from one end of Asia to the other Avith predatory raids upon unsuspecting travellers ; and so on into a wilder country, where the mountains close in upon us, and the Western tourist begins to realize that he is really in Asia, as groups of grunting camels, collected at the little railway stations, and their Avild-looking owners, tell of jour neys into the far interior, and excite a longing in his Cock-"], [16, "HAIFA. 2 ney breast to emancipate himself from the guidance of Cook, and plunge into the remote recesses of Asia Minor or Kur distan. As Ave approach Ephesus the country again becomes more fertile, and groves of fig-trees, surpassing all preconceived notions of the size ordinarily attained by these trees, reA'eal one of the principal sources of supply of those \" fine fresh figs\" which find their way in such abundance to American railway cars. As the modern Ephesus is a miserable little village, containing only a feAV huts and a very limited sup ply of donkeys, the wary traveller -will see that his are sent on from Smyrna beforehand, and Avill probably find some consolation for the absence of any competent guide or de cent accommodation, or appliances for seeing the ruins, in the evidence which this fact affords of the comparative rareness of tourist visitors. So far from being assailed by shouts for backsheesh, or bombarded by sellers of sham antiques, or struggled for by rival guides, one is left entirely to one's own devices on that desolate little platform. There is an apology for a hotel, it is true, where cold potted meats are to be obtained, and, by clint of much searching, a guide, himself an antique, turns up, but Ave are very sceptical of his competency. A row of columns still standing, Avhich once supported an aqueduct, and the crumbling ruins of a castle on a conical little hill immediately behind the railway station, suggest the mis taken idea that these are the ruins of Ephesus. They are very decent ruins, as ruins go, but the castle is a compara tively modern Seljiik stronghold, and there is nothing cer tain about the antiquity of the aqueduct. In exploring the castle we find that the blocks of stone of old Ephesus have been built into its walls, and that a still more ancient gate way, dating from the early period of the Byzantine Em pire, is also largely composed of these antique fragments, upon Avhich inscriptions are to be deciphered, proving that they formed part of a Greek temple. So, in the old mosque of Sultan Selim, Avhich is at the base of the hill, we find that the magnificent monolith columns of a still more ancient edifice have been used in the construc tion of what must in its day have been a fine specimen"], [17, "A VISIT TO EPHESUS. 3 of Saracenic architecture; but we have not yet reached the site of ancient Ephesus. As Ave stand on the steps of the old mosque we look over a level and marshy plain, about a mile broad, which extends to the foot of two rocky hills, each about two hundred feet high, and divided from each other by AA-hat appears to be a chasm. Behind these is a higher ridge, backed by the mountain chain. It is on these tAvo rocky eminences, and on their farther slopes, now hid den from view, that the ancient Ephesus stood ; but the problem Avhich has for many years vexed antiquarians is the site, until recently undiscovered, of what gave the town its chief notoriety. The temple of the great goddess Diana, about a quarter of the way across the plain, Avas a wide, low mound, and here it is that the recent excavations of Mr. Wood have laid bare one of the most interesting arch\u00e6ological discoveries of modern times. We eagerly tramp across the mud and over the corn-stalks of this year's crop to the debris, and, climbing up it, look clown upon a vast depressed area, filled Avith frag ments of magnificent marble columns, and Avith carved blocks on which are inscriptions so fresh that they seem to have been engraved yesterday, all jumbled together in a hopeless confusion, but from amid which Mr. Wood, who has had a force of three hundred men excavating here for the three pre vious years, has unearthed many \\-aluable memorials. At the time of our visit the work was suspended and Mr. Wood was away, nor was it possible to obtain from the utterly dilapi dated old Arab who called himself a guide, any coherent ac count of the last results, beyond the fact that a ship had come to take them away. I made out one inscription, which was apparently a votive tablet to the daughter of the Emperor Aurelius Antoninus, but in most cases, though the engraving, as far as it Avent, was clear, the fragments were too small to contain more than a feAV words. In places the marble pavement of the temple was clearly defined, and its size was well Avorthy the fame which ranked it among the seven wonders of the world. From here a long, muddy trudge took us to the base of the hill, or mount, called Pion, on the flank of Avhich ia the cave of the Seven Sleepers, and attached to it is the well-known"], [18, "HAIFA. 4 legend of the seven young men who went to sleep here, and awoke, after two hundred years, to find matters so changed that they were overcome by the shock. When I surmounted the hill and looked down upon the Stadium, the Agora, the Odeon, and other ruins, I Avas conscious of two predominat ing sentiments. One Avas surprise and the other disap pointment; surprise, that one of the most populous and cele brated cities in the Avorld should have arisen on such a site; and disappointment, that so little of its magnificence re mained. From an architectural point of view there is absolutely nothing left Avorth looking at. Lines of broken stone mark the limits of the principal buildings. The Stadium, Avhich accommodated 76,000 persons, and one of the theatres, which accommodated over 56,000, are almost shapeless mounds. The Avhole scene is one of most complete desolation, and Ave are driven to our imagination to realize Avhat Ephesus once must have been. In the case of Palmyra and Baalbec no such effort is necessary; enough is left for us to repeople without difficulty those splendid solitudes; but in Ephesus all is saA-age and dreary in the extreme; deep fissures run into the rock, which must have formed nearly the centre of the town ; huge boulders of natural stone suggest the wild character of some portion of the city in its palmiest days. It is difficult to conceive to what use the citizens deA'Oted this Mount Pion, Avith its crags and caverns and fissures. The lines of the old port are clearly defined by the limits of a marsh, from which a sluggish stream, formerly a canal, runs to the sea, about three miles distant, not far from the debouchure of the Meander. No doubt the mass of the city surrounded the port, but there is a marvellous lack of debris in this direction. Between the Temple of Diana and the foot of Mount Pion there is not a stone, so that the probability is that the temple was situated amid groves of trees. On the hill there are stones, or, rather, rocks, enough, but they are of huge size, and for the most part natural. Of actual city comparatively few remains still exist. No doubt its columns and monuments and slabs have supplied materials for the ornamentation and construction of many cities, and the con venience of getting to it by sea has materially aided the"], [19, "A VISIT TO EPHESUS. 5 spoilers. Still, the site of ancient Ephesus affords abundant material for conjecture, and the more one studies the local topography the more difficult is it to picture to one's self Avhat the ancient city was like. From historical association it must ever remain one of the most interesting spots in the East, Avhile, even from a pure ly picturesque point of view, the wild and rugged grandeur of the scenery amid Avhich it is situated cannot fail to stamp it upon the memory. As I believe it is intended to continue excavations, Ave may hope for still further results, and there can be no doubt that, Avhen once the obstacles Avhich are noAV throAvn in the Avay by the present government, to all scientific or antiquarian research in Turkey, are removed by the political changes now pending in the East, a rich field of exploration will be opened, not at Ephesus alone, but throughout the little-knoAvn ruined cities of Asia Minor."], [20, "d THE RUINS OF ATHLIT. Haifa, Nov. 27, 1882. \u2014 The more you examine the coun tries most frequented by tourists, the more you are per plexed to comprehend the reasons which decide them to confine themselves to certain specified routes, arranged ap parently by guides and dragomans, with a view of conceal ing from them the principal objects of interest. There is certainly not one tourist in a hundred who visits the Holy Land Avho has ever heard of Athlit, much less been there, and yet I know of few finer ruins to the Avest of the Jordan. To the east the magnificent remains of Jerash, Amman, and Arak-el Emir are incomparably more interesting, and these, of course, are also almost ignored by tourists ; but that may be accounted for by the fact that special permission from the government is required to visit them, while an impression still exists that the journey is attended Avith some risk. Practically this is not the case. It takes a long time to re moA'e an impression of this kind, and it is the interest of a large class of persons who live on blackmail to keep it up. But in the case of Athlit there is no such draA\\rback. Prob ably the neglect with Avhich it is treated is due largely to the fact that no scriptural association attaches to the locality, and people Avould rather go to Nazareth than examine the majestic remains of Roman civilization, or the ruder super structures of crusading Avarfare. The easiest way to reach Athlit is to go to it from Car mel. As the monastery there is a most modern structure, about fifty years old, tourists often get as far as that, be cause the guide takes them there; but they know nothing of the mysteries of this sacred mountain, second only to Sinai, in the estimation of the modern JeAV, in the sanctity of its reputation, and they turn back when, by riding a few miles down the coast, they Avould follow a route full of in-"], [21, "THE RUINS OF ATHLIT. 7 terest. The road traverses a plain about two miles in Avidth. On the left, the rugged limestone slopes of the mountain are perforated with caves \u2014 in the earliest ages of Christianity the resorts of hermits, from Avhom the order of the Carmelites subsequently arose. Here tradition still points out the spot where the crusading king, St. Louis of France, was shipwrecked; and in a gorge of the mountains may still be seen the foundations of the first monastery, near a copious spring of clearest water, where the pious monarch was entertained by the first monks, Avhom, out of gratitude, he enabled subsequently to establish themselves upon the site occupied by the present monastery, and to found an or der which has since become celebrated. Along this line of coast there is an uninterrupted stretch of sandy beach, upon which the full force of the Mediterranean breaks in long lines of rollers, and which would afford an interesting field of study to the conchologist. Among the most curious shells are the Murex brandaris and the Murex truneidus, the prickly shells of the fish Avhich in ancient times yielded the far-famed Tyrian purple. The Ph\u0153nicians obtained the precious dye from a vessel in the throat of the fish. Instead of following closely the line of coast, I kept near the base of the Carmel range, reaching in about tAA-o hours from Carmel the village of El Tireh, Avhere the mosque is part of an old Benedictine monastery, the massive Avails of which have been utilized for religious purposes by the Mos lems. Their Avorship has had little effect upon the inhab itants, who are the most notorious thieves and turbulent rogues in the whole country side. They are rich enough to indulge their taste for violence with comparative impunity, as they can always square it with the authorities. Their vil lage is surrounded with a groA-e of thirty thousand olive trees and the rich plain, extending to the sea, is nearly all owned by them. Indeed, their evil reputation keeps other Avould-be proprietors at a distance. Here the plain begins to slope backward from the sea, so as to prevent the water from the mountains from finding a natural outlet, and in summer the country becomes miasmatic and feverish. From El Tireh, where the inhabitants treated me Avith great civility, I crossed the plain, and in an hour more"], [22, "8 HAIFA reached an insignificant ruin called El Dustrey, a corruption of the crusading name \"les Destroits,\" or \"The Straights,\" so called from a gorge in the limestone ridge, which here sep arates the plain from the sea. This very remarkable forma tion extends for many miles down the coast. It is a rugged ridge, varying from twenty to fifty feet in height, and com pletely cutting off the sea beach from the fertile plain be hind. Here and there it is split by fissures, through Avhich the Avinter torrents find their Avay to the sea. Skirting this ridge, we suddenly come upon an artificial cutting, just Avide enough to alloAV the passage of a chariot. At the en trance, holes Avere cut into the rock on both sides, evidently used in ancient times for closing and barring a passage-way. The cutting through the rock Avas from six to eight feet deep and from sixty to eighty yards in length. The deep ruts of the chariot-wheels were distinctly visible. Here and there on the sides steps had been cut leading to the ridge, which had been fortified. Passing through this cutting, we debouch upon a sandy plain and a reedy marsh, in Avhich my companion had the year before killed a wild boar; and here we Avere in the presence of a majestic ruin. Immediately facing us was a fragment of wall, eighty feet high, sixteen feet thick, and thirty-five yards long. It towers to a height of one hun dred and twenty feet above the sea, and is a conspicuous landmark. It has been partially stripped of the external layer of carved stone blocks, and has furnished a quarry to the inhabitants for some centuries. The wall had evidently once continued across the base of the promontory upon which the ancient fortress and town were built. Passing up a rocky passage and under an archway of comparatively modern date, and which could still be closed by means of massive Avooden doors, we enter the enceinte, and discover that the Avhole promontory is underlaid Avith huge vaults. It became also evident that the immense fragment I have de scribed Avas the outer wall of a large building, for on the inside were three ribbed, pointed arches, supported on cor bels, representing on the left a bearded head, on the right a head shaven on the crown, with curling hair on the sides; in the centre a cantalever, with three lilies in low relief. As"], [23, "THE RUINS OF ATHLIT. 9 the roof had fallen in, the spring of the arches alone re mained. The Avhole Avas constructed of blocks of stone about three feet long, two feet high, and two feet A\\'ide. The prom ontory upon which all this solid masonry had been erected Avas washed on three sides by the sea. It rose aboATe it pre cipitously to a height of about fifty feet. The area was occu pied by a miserable population of possibly a hundred squalid, half-clad Arabs, whose huts were built among the ruins, thus preventing any effectual examination of them. It Avould be difficult to conceive a greater contrast than is presented by these Avretched fellahin and their burroAving habitations Avith the splendour of the edifices and the opulence Avhich must have characterized the former inhabitants. Here and there we see a fragment of a granite column, Avhile, when we reach the brink of the cliff which forms the sea-face of the promontory, Ave are again surprised at the stupendous scale of these an cient Avorks, and of the sea-wall built out upon a ledge of rocks, exposed to the full fury of the waves, and still stand ing to a height of forty or fifty feet. To the right of the promontory, a Avail, the base of which is washed by the Avaves, is perforated by three arches. It presents a most picturesque appearance. The southern face is, hoAvever, the most perfect. Here there were evidently two tiers of walls, one upon the sea-level and one upon the face of the cliff. Descending into the space between these I perceived an opening in the side of the rock, and found myself in a vaulted chamber, Avhich Avas sufficiently lighted by apertures in the rock for me to measure it roughly. I es timated the length at a hundred and tAventy feet, the breadth at thirty - six, and the height at thirty. It so happened that on the occasion of my visit it was blowing half a gale of wind from the seaward. The breakers were rolling in upon the reefs at the base of the promontory, throAving their spray high up on the ruined walls, and producing an effect Avhich, with the grandeur of the surroundings, was in describably impressive. This chamber Avas the handsomest of a series of vaults, several others of which I have explored under the guidance of the shiek, by means of candles and torches. They are altogether six iu number, running round a rectangle measuring about five hundred feet by three"], [24, "HAIFA. 10 hundred. They are of different sizes, varying from fifty to three hundred feet in length, from thirty to fifty in breadth, and from twenty-five to thirty in height. The name of the town which stood here in ancient times has never been discovered. This is the more singular as it must evidently have been a place of considerable impor tance in the time of the Romans, more probably as a fortress than as a place of commerce. Its natural advantages for defence suggest themselves at once. It is important in the history of the crusades as being the last spot held in Pales tine by the crusaders, who evacuated it in 1291. It Avas then destroyed by the Sultan Melik el Ashraf, so that the most modern parts of the ruins are only six hundred years old. But the crusaders must have entered into possession of what was then an ancient fortress in a high state of pres ervation. When they took it, it became celebrated as Cas tellum Peregrinorum, or the Castle of the Pilgrims. It is also spoken of in the crusading records as Petra Incisa, from the fact that it was entered through the cutting in the rock Avhich I have described. In 1218 the Knights Tem plars restored the castle, and constituted it the chief seat of their order. They found \" a number of strange, unknoAvn coins.\" That it Avas a place of great strength may be in ferred from the fact that it was chosen by such good judg es as the Knights Templars as their chief stronghold; that it Avas successfully besieged by orie of the sultans of Egypt, and that it was finally abandoned only because every other crusading possession in Palestine had succumbed."], [25, "A JEWISH COLONY IN ITS INFANCY. Haifa, Dec. 10. \u2014 About sixteen miles to the south of the projecting point of Carmel, upon which the celebrated mon- astery is perched above the sea, there lies a tract of land which has suddenly acquired an interest OAving to the fact of its having been purchased by the Central Jewish Coloni- zation Society of Roumania, Avith a vieAV of placing upon it emigrants of the Hebrew persuasion who have been com- pelled to quit the country of their adoption in consequence of the legal disabilities to Avhich they are subjected in it, and Avho have determined upon making a bona fide attempt to change the habits of their lives and engage in agricultural pursuits. I was invited by the local agent in charge of this enterprise to accompany him on a visit to the new property, whither he was bound with a vieAV of making ar- rangements for housing and placing upon it the first settlers. Traversing the northern portion of the fertile plain of Sha- ron, Avhich extends from Jaffa to Carmel, we enter by a gorge into the lower spurs of the Carmel range, which is distant at this point about three miles from the seacoast, and, Avinding up a steep path, find ourselves upon a fertile plateau about four hundred feet above the level of the sea. Here over a thousand acres of pasture and arable land have been purchased, on which a small hamlet of half a dozen native houses and a storehouse belonging to the late pro- prietor compose the existing accommodation. This hamlet is at present occupied by the fellahin who Avorked the land for its former OAvner, aud it is proposed to retain their ser vices as laborers and copartners in the culti\\-ation of the soil until the new-comers shall have become sufficiently indoc trinated in the art of agriculture to be able to do for them selves. The experiment of associating JeAvs and Moslem fellahin"], [26, "HAIFA. 12 in field labor will be an interesting one to Avatch, and the preliminary discussions on the subject were more pictu resque than satisfactory. The meeting took place in the storehouse, where JeAvs and Arabs squatted promiscuously amid the heaps of grain, and chaffered over the terms of their mutual copartnership. It would be difficult to im agine anything more utterly incongruous than the spectacle thus presented \u2014 the stalwart fellahin, with their wild, shaggy, black beards, the brass hilts of their pistols project ing from their waistbands, their tasselled kufeihahs drawn tightly over their heads and girdled with coarse black cords, their loose, flowing abbas, and sturdy bare legs and feet; and the ringleted, effeminate -looking JeAvs, in caf tans reaching almost to their ankles, as oily as their red or sandy locks, or the expression of their countenances \u2014 the former inured to hard labor on the burning hillsides of Palestine, the latter fresh from the Ghetto of some Rou manian town, unaccustomed to any other description of ex ercise than that of their Avits, but already quite convinced that they knew more about agriculture than the people of the country, full of suspicion of all advice tendered to them, and animated by a pleasing self-confidence which I fear the first practical experience will rudely belie. In strange con trast with these Roumanian JeAvs Avas the Arab Jew Avho acted as interpreter \u2014 a stout, handsome man, in Oriental garb, as unlike his European coreligionists as the fellahin themselves. My friend and myself, in the ordinary costume of the British or American tourist, completed the party. The discussion was protracted beyond midnight \u2014 the na tive peasants screaming in Arabic, the Roumanian Israel ites endeavoring to outtalk them in German jargon, the interpreter vainly trying to make himself heard, everybody at cross - purposes because no one was patient enough to listen till another had finished, or modest enough to wish to hear anybody speak but himself. Tired out, I curled my self on an Arab coverlet, which seemed principally stuffed with fleas, but sought repose in vain. At last a final rup ture Avas arrived at, and the fellahin left us, quivering Avith indignation at the terms proposed by the new-comers. Sleep brought better counsel to both sides, and an arrange-"], [27, "A JEWISH COLONY IN ITS INFANCY. 13 ment was finally arrived at next morning Avhich I am afraid has only to be put into operation to fail signally. There is nothing more simple than farming in co-operation with the fellahin of Palestine if you go the right way to work about it, and nothing more hopeless if attempted upon a system to which they are unaccustomed. Probably, after a consid erable loss of time, money, and especially of temper, a more practical modus operandi will be arrived at. I am bound to say that I did not discover any aversion on the part of the Moslem fellahin to the proprietorship by Israelites of their land, on religious grounds. The only difficulty lay in the division of labor and of profit, where the owners of the land were entirely ignorant of agriculture, and therefore de pendent on the co-operation of the peasants, on terms to be decided between them. I eagerly Avelcomed the first streaks of daAvn to get out of the close atmosphere in which three had been sleeping be sides myself, and watch the sun rise over the eastern moun tains of Palestine. Ascending to the top of the hill in rear of the hamlet, I enjoyed a magnificent view. To the south the eye folloAved the coast-line to a point AA'here the ruins of C\u00e6sarea, plainly visible through a glass, bounded the pros pect. From the plain of Sharon, behind it, the hills rose in swelling undulations, unusually Avell-Avoodedfor Palestine, to a height of about two thousand feet, the smoke of numerous villages mingling Avith the morning haze. In the extreme distance to the northeast might be discerned the lofty sum mits of Hermon, and in the middle distance the rounded top of Tabor; while northward, in immediate proximity, Avas the range of Carmel, Avith the Mediterranean bounding the western horizon. While exploring the neAvly purchased tract and examining its agricultural capabilities, I came upon what were evidently the traces \u2014 they could hardly be called the ruins \u2014 of an ancient town. They were on a rocky hillside, not far from the hamlet. My attention was first attracted by Avhat had evidently been an old Roman road, the worn ruts of the chariot - wheels being plainly visible in the rock. Farther on Avere the marks of ancient quarrying, the spaces in the rock, about two feet square, shoAving Avhere massive blocks had been heAvn. The former"], [28, "14 HAIFA. owners of the property, observing the interest with which I examined these traces, took me to a spot where the natives, in quarrying, had unearthed a piece of wall composed of stone blocks of the same size, neatly fitted, and approached by steps carved in the rock. In close proximity to this was a monument, the meaning of which I Avas for some time at a loss to conjecture. It consisted of three sides of a square excaA-ation hewn out of the solid rock of the hillside, un covered, and the depth of which it was difficult to deter mine, on account of the debris which had accumulated. Upon the faces of the chamber thus formed, rows of small niches had been carved, each niche about a foot high, six inches wide, and six inches deep. The niches were about two inches apart, and on one face I counted six rows or tiers of eighteen niches each. The other sides were not so perfect, and the rock had broken away in places. I finally decided that the whole had probably in ancient times been a vault appropriated to the reception of cinerary urns, but the matter is one Avhich I must leave to some more ex perienced antiquarian than I am to determine definitely. It is not to be wondered at that this obscure and partially concealed ruin should have escaped the notice of the Pales tine Exploration Survey. One of the fellahin now told us of a marvel in the neigh bourhood. It was a hole in the rock, to Avhich, by apply ing one's ear, one could hear the roar of a mighty river. Attracted by the prospect of so singular a phenomenon, we scrambled through the prickly underwood with Avhich the hillsides are thickly covered, and finally emerged upon a small valley, at the head of Avhich Avas an open grassy space, and near it a table of flat limestone rock. In the centre of it was an oblong hole, about tAvo inches by three, the sides of which had been Avorn smooth by the curious or superstitious, who had probably visited the spot for ages. First, the Arab stretched himself at full length, and laid his ear upon the aperture. I followed suit, and became conscious not only of a strong draught rushing upward from subterranean depths, but of a distant roaring sound, as of a remote Niagara. For a moment I Avas puzzled, and the Arab was triumphant, for I had treated his rush-"], [29, "A JEWISH COLONY IN ITS INFANCY. 15 ing subterranean river Avith a contemptuous scepticism ; yet here Avere undeniably the sounds of roaring water. Had it been a distant gurgle or trickle it would have been ex plicable, but it was manifestly impossible that any river could exist large enough to produce the sounds I heard. Though the clay Avas perfectly still, the draught upward was strong enough to blow away the corner of a hand kerchief held over the mouth of the hole. At last I solved the problem to my own satisfaction. By ascending the hill on the right the roar of \" the loud - voiced neighbouring ocean,\" distant between two and three miles, was distinctly audible. It had been bloAving the day before, and the rollers Avere breaking upon the long line of coast. I now conjectured that the crack in the rock must extend to some cavern on the seashore, and form a sort of Avhispering-gal lery, conducting the sound of the breakers with great dis tinctness to the top of the hills, but blending them so much that it seemed at first a continuous rushing noise. This was an explanation contrary to all tradition, and it was re ceived by the Arab with incredulity. We noAV descended once more to the plains, and, cross ing them, reached the village of Tantura, where we arrived about midday, passing first, howe\\-er, the ruined fortress of Muzraa, a massive block of masonry about fifty yards square, the Avails of Avhich are standing to a height of about ten feet ; then turning aside to the old Roman bridge, Avhich spans in a single high arch the artificial cutting through the limestone rocks by which the ancients facilitated the egress of a winter-torrent to the sea. The inhabitants of Tantura have the reputation of being very bad people, and three years ago I saAV a party of French tourists at Jeru salem who had been attacked and robbed by them. We were, however, entertained Avith the greatest hospitality, having a levee of the sheik and village notables, and with difficulty escaping from a banquet Avhich they Avere prepar ing for us. They live in a miserable collection of hovels amid the almost defaced ruins of the old town, traces of which, howeArer, are abundant in the neighbourhood. A lofty fragment of Avail on a projecting promontory half a mile to the north of the town is all that remains of what"], [30, "HAIFA 16 must haAre been a castle of grand dimensions. A chain of small, rocky islets, a feAV hundred yards from the shore, forms a sort of natural breakwater, and at very little ex pense Tantura could be converted into a good port. As it is, Avhen the weather is smooth, native craft run in here, and Avhen once at their anchorage can defy any gale. Tantura, or Dor, Avas one of the towns assigned to the half tribe of Manasseh, but Ave read that they failed to expel the Ca naanites from it, though Avhen Israel \" became strong they put them to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.\" In the time of the Romans Dor was a mercantile town of some importance, and, though in the Avars of the Diadochi it was besieged and partly destroyed, the Roman general Gabinius restored the town and harbor, and its architectu ral beauty was such that we read that even in the time of St. Jerome its ruins were still an object of admiration. Un fortunately, since the Turkish occupation, all these coast cities have been used as quarries for the construction of mosques and fortifications. The marble and granite pil lars and columns, and the carved blocks of stone which formed the outside casings of the walls, have been carried aAvay, leaving nothing but the mere skeletons of ruins as forlorn and desolate as the peasantry who find shelter be neath them."], [31, "THE TEMPLE SOCIETY. Haifa, Dec. 25. \u2014 There are probably not many of your readers who have ever heard of \" The Temple Society,\" and yet it is a religious body numbering over 5000 mem bers, of whom more than 300 are in America, 1000 in Pales tine, and the remainder scattered over Europe, principally in Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. The founder of the sect, if sect it can be called, is a cer tain Prof. Christophe Hoffman of Wiirtemberg, Avho, after studying at the University of Tubingen about thirty -five years ago, became a minister of the Lutheran Church and the principal of the College of Crischona, not far from Basle, in Switzerland. Here he became known as entertain ing certain theological opinions which soon acquired some notoriety, as they consisted mainly of a criticism on the ac tion of the Church with reference to the rationalistic opin ions then becoming prevalent in Germany, and Avhich found their culminating expression in the writings of the late Dr. Strauss. Mr. Hoffman, Avho was an ardent opponent of the modern and sceptical tendency of German thought, attrib uted its groAving influence to the feeble opposition offered to it by the Church, and maintained that its impotency to arrest the evil arose from the inconsistent practice of its members Avith the moral teaching Avhich they professed. Under the influence of this conviction he abandoned his charo-e at Crischona, and with his brothers-in-law founded a college at \" Salon,\" not far from Stuttgart, and commenced an agitation in favour of church reform, both in written publications and by his personal influence. He was shortly after elected to the Diet at Frankfort, where he presented a petition signed by 12,000 persons in favour of reform of the Lutheran Church. His Biblical studies at this time, especially of the book of 2"], [32, "HAIFA. 18 Revelations, led him to the conclusion that the period of the second advent of the Messiah was approaching, but that Christ could only be received by a Church which had at tempted to embody his moral teaching in daily life; in fact, that he could only recognize those as his own at his second coming who had succeeded in practically applying the ethi cal code which he had taught when he came first; and he reproached the Church with failing to inaugurate a social reconstruction which should render possible a Christ life in the true acceptation of the term. A doctrine based on Scripture, and directed against the ecclesiastical system to which he belonged, naturally brought him into direct collis ion with it; and as an interpretation of the NeAV Testament which strikes at the root of all compromise between pro fession and practice must ever be an inconvenient doctrine to churches which are based upon such compromise, Mr. Hoffman was summarily expelled, carrying with him, how eA-er, a large body of folloAvers. He now, with a feAV friends, established a sort of colony in Wurtemberg, where an effort Avas made to put into daily practice these high aspirations, and the number of adher ents throughout Europe and in America grew as his vieAvs began to be more Avidely promulgated and understood. In 1867 the more prominent members of the society held a meeting, at Avhich it was decided that as the second advent of the Messiah Avas expected to occur in Palestine, the Holy Land was the fitting place for the establishment of the cen tral point of the Church Avhich was preparing itself to re ceive him ; that there should be laid the corner-stone of the new spiritual temple which gave the name of the society ; and that it Avas the first duty of those who Avere waiting for his coming to restore the land to Avhich so many Bibli cal promises especially attached. While they considered that the new kingdom which Avas to OAvn Christ as its king Avas to embrace all those who were prepared to receive him, in all lands and from among all races, yet the spiritual throne would be erected in Palestine, and its material restoration must be a necessary preliminary to its final and ultimate re demption. It Avas therefore decided that while the great majority of the members of the society should remain in"], [33, "THE TEMPLE SOCIETY. 19 Europe to Avitness for the truth, and to contribute to the support of the attempt to be made in the Holy Land, a cer tain number should proceed thither to establish themselves in trade and agriculture, and endeavour by the example of honest industry to elevate the native population and redeem the land from its present waste and desolate condition. In 1868 Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Hartegg, and some others went to Constantinojfle Avith a view of obtaining a firman from the Porte, but, failing in this, they proceeded in the follow ing year to Palestine, where, attracted by the great advan tages of soil, climate, and position offered by the lands at the foot of Mount Carmel, in the neighbourhood of Haifa, they fixed upon that locality as the initial point of the en terprise. Hither shortly flocked agriculturists and handi craftsmen representing all the important industries, and they proceeded to lay out their village and build their houses on the slope between the foot of the mount and the sea, about a mile to the westward of the native town; but they soon found that it Avas impossible to do this without meeting with the most strenuous opposition on the part of the na tive government, and incurring the covert hostility of the monks Avho have for seven hundred years enjoyed a spiritual monopoly of Mount Carmel. As the colonists Avere almost Avithout exception men of very moderate means, and be lieved in the responsibilities of individual ownership, and not in any communistic system, they soon found themselves engaged in a severe and unequal struggle. Ignorant of the language, the country, the methods of agriculture, the manners and customs of the inhabitants, \u2022who regarded them askance, and unused to the climate, their faith and powers of endurance Avere taxed to the utmost. Not only did they persevere Avith the most unflinching reso lution at Haifa, but extended their operations to Jaffa, where at that time a colony of American Adventists, whom some of your readers may remember, and who had emigrated there about tAventy years ago, was in process of dissolution. Purchasing the remains of their settlement, a new group of the Temple Society established themselves there. Since then tAvo more colonies have been formed, one at Sarona, about an hour distant from Jaffa, and one in the immediate"], [34, "20 HAIFA. neighbourhood of Jerusalem, where the leader, Mr. Hoffman, at present resides. The united population of these four colonies amounts to about one thousand souls, besides Avhich a few families are also established at Beyrout and Nazareth. But the largest settle ment is at Haifa, where the society numbers over three hun dred. These now, after fourteen years of vicissitudes, appear to be entering upon a period of comparative prosperity. They have not long since completed a twelve years' struggle with the government for the legalization of the titles to their land, which the authorities endeavoured to prevent by throAving every possible obstacle in the way ; and while the question was pending they were compelled to pay their taxes through the nominal native owners, who assessed the lands at four times their actual ATalue, putting the balance into their own pockets. All these difficulties have, however, at last been surmounted. They now hold their seven hundred acres of fine arable aud vine land free of all encumbrance, and their well -cultivated fields, trim gardens, and substantial Avhite stone mansions form a most agreeable and unexpected pict ure of civilization upon this semi-barbarous coast. Meanwhile, the influence of three hundred industrious, simple, honest farmers and artificers has already made its mark upon the surrounding Arab population, who have adopted their improved methods of agriculture, and whose own industries haA-e receiA-ed a stimulus which bids fair to make Haifa one of the most prosperous towns on the coast. Already, since the adA-ent of the Germans, the native popu lation has largely increased. New stone houses have sprung up in all directions, and many are in course of construction. The value of land has increased threefold, and the statistics of the port show a large increase in the exports and imports. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation is the introduction of wheeled vehicles. Fifteen years ago a cart had never been seen by the inhabitants of Haifa. Omnibuses, owned and driven by natives, noAV run four or five times a day be tAveen Haifa and Acre, the capital of the province, distant about ten miles. It is true that the road is the smooth sea beach, and that its excellence varies according to the state of the tide, but in this country carts come before roads, and"], [35, "THE TEMPLE SOCIETY. \u25a0Jl fortunately its topographical features have been favourable to the employment of wheeled vehicles. On one side of Carmel, extending soutliAvard, is the plain of Sharon, and over this one may drive to Jaffa Avithout the necessity of road-making, so level and free from natural obstacle is it. On the other we may cross with equal ease the plain of Es draelon to the Sea of Tiberias \u2014 the experiment having been made recently \u2014 and a road has been constructed to Nazareth, distant about twenty-tAvo miles. This involved an expenditure on the part of the colonists of about one thousand dollars. It is used largely by the Arabs, who have contributed nothing towards it; but the effect on their minds, as they drive over it in their own carts, and remember that they owe both cart and road to the colonists, whom at first they mistrusted and disliked, is a sound moral investment, and bears its fruit in many ways. Fifteen years ago no one could venture outside the town gates to the AvestAvard after nightfall, for fear of being Avay laid and robbed by the laAvless inhabitants of Tireh \u2014 a vil lage noted for its bad character, about seven miles distant \u2014 Avho used to come marauding up to the outskirts of Haifa. Now one can ride and Avalk with safety in all directions and at all hours. The Germans have most of them learned to talk Arabic, and many an Arab that one meets salutes you with a guten morgen or guten abend, though that is probably the limit of their linguistic accomplishments ; but they re spect and like the colonists, and a good deal of land is now cultivated on shares by Germans and Arabs, who seem to arrange their business and agricultural operations to their mutual satisfaction and in perfect harmony. When we re member that the Carmelite monks have held the mountain for seven hundred years, and compare their influence over the native population Avith that which these honest Germans have acquired by simple example during less than fifteen, Ave have a striking illustration of the superiority of practice to preaching, for it should be remarked that any attempt at proselytism is entirely foreign to their principles. Their whole effort has been to commend their Christianity by scrupulous honesty in their dealings, by the harmony and simplicity of their conduct, and by the active industry of their lives."], [36, "THE TEMPLE COLONIES IN PALESTINE. Haifa, Jan. 20, 1883. \u2014 In a former letter I gave you a sketch of the origin of the Temple Society and of the religious motives which have led to the establishment of four agricultural colonies in the Holy Land by emigrants from Germany, America, Russia, and Switzerland. As I have taken up my winter residence in the principal one of these, situated beneath the shadow of Mount Carmel, some description of the place and its resources may not be with out interest for your readers. I know of no locality in the East Avhich offers greater attractions of position, climate, and association than this spot. Thanks to the efforts of the colonists, it has become an oasis of civilization in the wilder ness of Oriental barbarism, where the invalid in search of health, or the tourist on the lookout for a comfortable rest ing-place on his travels, will find good accommodation, and all the necessaries, if not the luxuries, of civilized life. Throughout the whole length of the coast of Palestine from Tyre to Gaza, only one deep indentation occurs. This is where it sweeps in a curve around the old fortress of St.\" Jean d'Acre, and terminates in the projecting precipice upon whose ledge the monastery of Carmel is situated. The bay thus formed is nine miles across from Acre to Car mel, and about four miles broad. It is bordered the whole distance by a smooth, hard beach, at the southeastern and most sheltered extremity of Avhich is situated the town of Haifa, a modern native town, squeezed in between an over hanging bluff, on Avhich are the ruins of an old castle, and the sea. It owes its origin to the arbitrary act of a pacha who, about a century ago, had rendered himself quasi-inde pendent of the Porte, and established the seat of his gov ernment at Acre. The population of old Haifa, situated near the point, having rebelled against him, he punished"], [37, "THE TEMPLE COLONIES IN PALESTINE. 23 them by razing it to the ground, and transported the inhab itants to the edge of the bay under the rock, on which he put a castle, while he surrounded them with a wall, thus keeping them prisoners. When he died, his successor was suppressed, the garrison of the castle was removed, and the wall Avas allowed to fall into disrepair. The inhabitants, Avho thus Avere restored to liberty, accustomed to their new location, began to cultivate the surrounding land and to in crease in wealth and prosperity. Their gardens spread to the eastward, where the brook Kishon, winding through a fertile plain, struggles to debouch into the sea, but only succeeds at certain seasons, owing to the huge sand-bars which form at its mouth. These dam it back into small lakes, Avhich are surrounded by date-groves, thus forming a most agreeable feature in the scenery. Behind the plain rises the low, Avooded range Avhich is traversed by the road leading to Nazareth. Though Haifa is comparatively modern, there are some traces of old ruins in the town, the Avails of an old crusad ing castle, one or two caverns, which bear marks of having been inhabited in the rocks immediately behind them, and the crumbling remains of an archway, dating, probably, from a period anterior to the crusades. Prior to the arrival of the colonists of the Temple Society, Haifa was as dirty as most Arab villages. It is now well paved throughout. The houses, all constructed of white limestone, quarries of which abound in the immediate vicinity, give it a clean and substantial appearance, and contain a bustling and thriving population of about six thousand inhabitants. Under the high cactus hedges at its eastern gateway are usually to be seen, squatting amid sacks of grain, hundreds of camels, which, attended by Avild-looking Arabs, have arrived with their loads of cereals from the Hauran, on the other side of the Jordan ; for Haifa is gradually becoming one of the great grain-exporting ports of the country, and one or two steamers are generally to be seen loading in the harbour. Leaving the tOAvn by the western gateAvay, we ride for about a mile parallel to the seashore between high cactus hedges, and suddenly find ourselves apparently transported into the heart of Europe. Running straight back from the beach"], [38, "24 HAIFA for about half a mile, and sloping upAvard for about a hun dred feet in that distance, to the base of the rocky sides of Carmel, runs the village street. On each side of it is a path way, with a double row of shade-trees, and behind them a series of white stone houses, of one and two stories, generally with tiled roofs, each surrounded with its garden, and each Avith a text in German engraved OA-er the doorway. There is another, smaller, parallel street. The whole settlement con tains about sixty houses and three hundred inhabitants. The English, American, and German vice-consuls are all colonists. There is a skilled physician, an architect, and engineer in the colony, an excellent hotel, a school, and meeting-house. The German government subscribes two thirds and the colonists one third of the funds required for the school. Some of the colonists are in business, and have stores in Haifa. There is also a good store in the colony, where all the most important trades are represented. There is one wind grist, and one steam mill, the latter in process of erection. There is a manufactory of oliv-e-oil soap, the export of which to America is yearly increasing, and now amounts to 50,000 pounds, and which may be purchased in NeAV York by such of your readers as have a fancy to Avash their hands with soap direct from the Holy Land, made from the oil of the olives of Carmel, at F. B. Nichols's, 62 William Street. There is also a factory for the manufacture of articles from olive Avood. Where Carmel rises abruptly from the upper end of the street, its rocky sides have been terraced to the summit, and about a hundred acres are devoted to the cultivation of the vine. Unfortunately, the varieties Avhich have been im ported from Germany all suffer severely from mildew. I have therefore sent to the United States for Concords and some of the hardier American varieties. Along the lower slopes are thick groves of olives. Scarped along the rugged mountain - side leads the road to the monastery, distant about a mile and a half. Situated about five hundred feet above the sea, it forms a conspicuous object in the land scape as seen from the colony. The views from the house in which I am living are a never-ending source of delight. To the east I look over"], [39, "THE TEMPLE COLONIES IN PALESTINE. 25 the native town and harbour, Avith the date-groves and the plain of the Kishon beyond, backed by the wooded range which separates it from the plain of Esdraelon. To the northeast the eye rests on the picturesque outline of the mountains of northern Palestine, with the rounded top of Jebel Jernink rising to a height of 4000 feet in the middle distance, and snow-clad Hermon tOAvering behind to a height of 9000 feet. Immediately to the north, across the blue waters of the bay, the white walls and minarets of Acre rise from the margin of the sea, and beyond it the coast- line, terminating in the white projecting cliff knoAvn as \"The Ladder of Tyre.\" To the northwestward we look across a plain about a mile wide, containing the colony lands, and beyond is the sea horizon, till we turn sufficiently to meet Carmel bluff and monastery. Behind us the moun- tain rises precipitously, throwing us at this time of the year into shade by three in the afternoon. But even on NeAV- Year's Day Ave do not grudge the early absence of the sun, for as I write the thermometer is standing at 66\u00b0'in the shade. It is not, hoAvever, the features of the scenery which constitute its chief beauty, but the Avonderful variations of light and shade, and the atmospheric effects peculiar to the climate, which invest it Avith a special charm. On the plain to the west of the colony, Avhich is bounded on tAvo sides by the sea, on one by the mountain, and on one by the colony, are the traces of the old town of Haifa, mentioned in the Tal- mud, but not in the Bible, Avhich Avas besieged and taken by storm by Tancrcd, the crusader, in 1100, with a massive ruin of sea-wall and other remains, from Avhich I have al ready dug out fragments of glass and pottery. Behind are the almost obliterated remains of an old fort, with here and there a piece of limestone cropping up, bearing the marks of man's handiAvork. Everywhere in Palestine we come upon the evidences of its antiquity. This plain, now made to yield of its abun dance under the skilful labour of the German colonists, is no exception, for in the time of the Romans it was the site of the city of Sycaminum, and in the groovings of rocks upon Avhich the sea noAV breaks we see the traces of Avhat were its baths ; in the mounds we find fragments of old masonry"], [40, "26 HAIFA. and cement ; in the depressions we see signs of wells, and in the rock cuttings of tombs. Only the other day I found, while digging in the garden for the prosaic purpose of planting cabbages, a fragment of polished agate which probably formed a part of the tessellated pavement of some Roman villa. So the process of decay and reconstruction goes on, and man is ever trying to rear something new on the ruins of the old. Let us hope that the sixty or seA-enty substantial houses of the neAV colony are but the outward and visible signs of that moral edifice which these good people have come to Palestine to erect, and that from the ruins of a crumbling ecclesiasticism they may build a temple worthy the worship of the future."], [41, "EXPLORING MOUNT CARMEL. Haifa, Feb. 7. \u2014 It was my fate as a child to. live in a country-house in Scotland, of Avhich one half was some cen turies old, Avith stone walls several feet thick, and circular stone steps leading up into a mysterious tower, Avhich Avas supposed to be haunted, and in which it was rumoured that a secret chamber existed, built in the Avail, and I remember perfectly that certain places seemed to sound hollow to blows of a crowbar, Avhich as I got older, I used to apply to sus pected localities. It is more years than I care to think of since those days, but I can trace a resemblance to that child ish feeling in the sensations by which I am animated when I wander over the gloomiest recesses of Carmel alone in search of caverns. It is called in some ancient Jewish record \" the mountain of the thousand caves,\" and has been inhabited from time immemorial by hermits and religious deAxotees. Independ ently of the Biblical record, Ave have historical traces of its holy character. According to the most ancient Persian traditions, sacred fire burned at the extreme western point of Carmel. Suetonius speaks of the oracles of the god of Car mel, and Alexander the Great repeats the saying. The Syrian city, Ecbatana, alluded to by Pliny, was situated on this mountain. Pythagoras lived here in retreat for some time because it had a reputation for superior sanctity, but Strabo mentions the caves as being haunts of pirates. They Avere doubtless used as places of refuge for bad characters, as Avell as of seclusion for pious ones. Others were used for tombs, others for crusaders' sentry-boxes, and now they are the retreat of flocks and herds, and in some instances store houses for grain. Those, however, thus utilized are comparatively few in number; I belieA-e many to be unknown even to the natives,"], [42, "HAIFA 28 while others are invested by them with a mysterious character, and their dimensions are probably exaggerated. I have re ceived accounts of some, AArhich I hope to visit, which are said to extend beyond any known exploration, of others which bear traces of carving and inscriptions, but noth ing can be more uncertain or unsatisfactory than native accounts upon all matters where definite information is re quired. I have tried exploring Avith guides and exploring alone, and have been almost as successful one Avay as the other. One of my first visits was to a ruin which I had observed crowning a summit of the range, but which was only visible from certain points, so shut in was it by the intervening mountain-tops. I started on horseback, determined to find my way alone, and struck into a valley where the narrow path followed a ledge of limestone rock, often not more than two feet Avide. I soon found myself diving into a sombre gorge, the precipitous sides of which rose abruptly from the bed of the Avinter torrent. As I proceeded it became more and more uncanny; the path Avas so narrow I could no longer venture to risk my horse's footing, as a slip would have in volved a fall of at least tAvo hundred feet. My ruin disap peared, and my gorge seemed to trend away from it, the sun sank behind the range, and the deep gloom of the solitary A-alley, hemmed in on all sides by terraces of limestone, with here and there a fissure indicating some caA7ernous recess, was becoming depressing. I tried to turn, but the ledge was too narroAv, so I was obliged to creep cautiously on in the wrong direction. I bec;an now rather to fear lest I should meet some one. not merely because passing would have been impossible, but because the spot was eminently Avell calculated for an act of violence, and, Avhile I always go about unarmed, I find that my neighbours seldom go out riding alone without carrying revolvers. The aspect of a Avild-looking Arab, Avith a gun slung behind him, suddenly turning a corner and coming straight towards me, was, under these circumstances, not reassuring. Fortunately, at the moment I saw him I had reached a spot where a huge rock had been displaced, and had left a vacant space large enough to enable me to"], [43, "EXPLORING MOUNT CARMEL. 29 turn comfortably, and I retraced my steps, amply repaid for my failure in not reaching the ruin, by the solemn grandeur of the part of the mountain into Avhich I had been penetrat ing, and by finding my Arab, when he overtook me, to be a communicative and harmless individual, who was on his Avay home from a cave in which he stored his grain, and which he assured me I should have reached if I had continued a few hundred yards farther. Beyond this, he said, the path led noAvhere. My next attempt Avas made Avith a friend who knew the way, and who led me along a corresponding ledge upon the opposite side of the valley, into a side gorge, Avhich we fol loAved past a Avail of rock, in which were two or three small caverns, which I entered, the largest not more than tAvelve or fourteen feet square, and shoAving no signs of having been inhabited. A huge rock detached from the mountain-side, and hollowed into a sort of gallery, is so celebrated among the natives that it has a name of its OAvn. Just behind it we turned to scramble almost straight up the mountain-side, covered with a scrub composed of camelthorn, odoriferous thyme, sage, marjoram, and arbutus, and then found Ave were at the foot of seven clearly defined terraces, com pletely encircling the rounded hill, upon the top of which stood the crumbling walls of an old fort, and Avhich formed portions of its defences. On one of these stood a shepherd's hut, and inside the enclosure made of bushes Avas the en trance to a cavern, about thirty yards long, four feet high, and twenty or thirty feet across. In it, Avhen they were not out feeding, the shepherd kept his flock of long-eared goats. Ascending to the ruin, I found it to consist of the remains of Avhat had evidently been a fort, the Avails of which, enclos ing a space of about sixty yards long by forty broad, were standing to a height of eight or ten feet, and AArere composed of blocks of limestone. At one angle a portion of the fortress had at a later period been converted into a church, the apse, Avith its arches, being in a tolerable state of preservation. The name of this ruin is Rushmea, and according to the most reliable sources of information to Avhich I have had access, it Avas used by Saladin to watch the progress of the"], [44, "HAIFA. 30 siege of Acre Avhen that place was held by the crusaders. Prior to the crusades and the formation of the order of the Carmelite monks, the mountain was inhabited by anchorites, some of whom claimed to have inherited the sacred char acter of Elijah and Elisha. For some time seven of them seem to have divided the claim betAveen them, and one of them is reported to have lived in a cave at Rushmea, which is said to contain carving and inscriptions. It Avas for this cave I was especially in search; but though I have visited the lo cality three times in all, twice Avith guides, and haA-e found some seven or eight caves, one of which had a carved lime stone entrance, none of them seemed of sufficient importance to answer the traditional description. A magnificent vieAV is obtained from the ruin over the Bay of Acre, with the tOAvn in the distance and the plain of Kishon beneath, and plainly visible the famous Avell for the possession of which Saladin and Richard C\u0153ur de Lion fought. I have visited this celebrated source, AATith its massive masonry and crum bling cistern, in the centre of which there is now a flourishing fig-tree. During the siege which Haifa then Avithstood, the town Avas completely destroyed, so that the crusading army had to remain in tents, and here it was that the lion-hearted king caught that severe fever which gave rise to reports of his death, and which resulted in his remaining for four weeks at Haifa to recover his health. That plain is as unhealthy now as it Avas then, and the date-groves, which are its most striking feature, must have existed then, for they are men tioned in the records of the year 1230, when King Amalrich II. died of a surfeit of sea-fish, for which the place is cele brated. To return to Rushmea. The whole hill-top is covered with the traces of remains far anterior to the ruins of crusading times. EveryAvhere we come upon the solid limestone foun dations of what must have been large buildings; there are flights of steps hewn in the rock, large square cuttings from Avhich blocks have been taken, places where circular holes have been drilled, grooves, niches, and excavations. On a plateau about a hundred yards to the Avest is a series of mas sive stone arches in a very fair state of preservation. I found the elevation of Rushmea, by my aneroid, to be as"], [45, "EXPLORING MOUNT CARMEL. 31 nearly as possible seven hundred feet above the sea. In a val ley behind it, and a hundred feet below it, are a dozen olive trees of immense age, and near them a celebrated spring, called the Well of Elisha. It is not above twelve feet deep, and, on descending into it, I found that it was in fact not a spring, but a subterranean stream which enters a receptacle formed for it in the rock, from a cave at the side, and from which it disappears again. Instead of returning from Rush mea by the Avay I had come, I pushed up to the head of the valley in AA'hich the spring is situated. On two of the hills Avhich rise from it I found terraces and the foundations of stone edifices. Indeed, wherever one wanders in Carmel, one is apt to stumble upon these substantial records of its bygone history. As the mountain is about thirteen miles long and nine miles Avide at its southeastern extremity, and as every valley and hillside and plateau has at one time or other been inhabited, and as many of these remain still to be explored for the first time, there is abundant field for inves tigation, and it is impossible to take a ride or a scramble in any direction without coming upon some object of interest. Nor is it possible to lose one's Avay Avhen alone, except to a limited extent, for the nearest hill-top, if you can get to it, is sure to let you know Avhere you are. Thus leaving Rushmea without a guide, and soon without a path, I pushed through the scrub, now dismounting and driving my horse before me, now forcing him, much to his discomfort, through the prickly bushes. Even at this time of year the hills are bright Avith scarlet anemones, and the delicate pink or white cyclamen, and fragrant with aromatic odours as we crush through the shrubs. Suddenly I came upon the foundations of a wall, Avhich I followed for about a hundred yards, and which Avas about four feet in thickness. Near it, half hidden by the bushes, Avas a circular block of limestone about five feet high and the same in diameter, in the centre of Avhich had been drilled a hole. It looked like the section of some gigantic column such as Ave see in some of the temples of Upper Egypt; but it stood alone, and I fail to imagine its design. Possibly it may have been used for sacrificial purposes. Shortly after I found myself on a high, level plateau, Avhere the soil was so excellent, and the rocks"], [46, "32 HAIFA had so far disappeared, that it would do admirably for farm ing purposes. It seemed to extend over some hundreds of acres. Formerly, the Avhole of these fertile tracts of Carmel were covered Avith magnificent forests \u2014 even in the memory of man \u2014 but of late years the demand for charcoal has so much increased that the mountain has been almost completely denuded of trees, and although a strict order has been issued by the government against the felling of timber, it still continues, and, thanks to the system of backsheesh, the export of charcoal from Haifa last year exceeded that of any previous year. Keeping westward by my compass I soon after 'struck a path, and finally dropped down upon the German colony near Haifa, after a day's ram ble through the most delightful scenery, every step of which was replete with historical association and antiquarian in terest."], [47, "THE VALLEY OF THE MARTYRS. Haifa, Feb. 12. \u2014 A more thorough examination of the rocky hillsides of the Carmel promontory in the vicinity of the celebrated monastery than I have been hitherto able to give it, has revealed many spots of interest, and one in par ticular, which seems to have escaped the observation of the Palestine Exploration Fund Survey. About two miles and a half from Haifa the road to Jaffa passes betAveen a project ing spur of the range and a mound about a hundred feet high, Avhich formed the centre of the ancient city of Sy caminum, and Avhich probably conceals some interesting re mains, Avhich I hope some day to be able to unearth. It projects out into the sea, and on the flat rocks at its base, over Avhich the waves break in stormy Aveather, there is a large circular bath excavated by the Romans, about twen ty feet in circumference, with a channel cut through the rock, Avhich admits the rising tide. All round this mound are fragments of columns, carved capitals, and blocks of polished marble, some of the lightest of AA-hich I have car ried a\\A'ay; but it is upon the unknown contents of the mound itself that my imagination is prone to speculate. On the left of the road are caverns and rock-cut tombs, some containing the remains of loculi; and the surface of the smooth limestone rock leaves traces of ancient steps, and cuttings, shoAving that in old times the hand of man had been actively employed upon it. I had often examined these, and thought I had reached their limit, when, pushing my exploration farther up the steep hillside a fe>v days ago, through the low brush by which it is covered, I unexpect edly came upon a plateau eight or ten acres in area, and about tAvo hundred feet above the level of the sea, covered with the debris of ancient ruins. It AA-as evidently the up per part of the old city of Sycaminuin, and commanded a 3"], [48, "34 HAIFA, magnificent view of the coast-line southAvard, and of what was formerly the loAver toAvn, which has heretofore been supposed to be all that there Avas of the city. This upper town, from its cool and delightful position, was probably the residence of the wealthier inhabitants; here, too, were fragments of marble columns and carved capitals, and conspicuous among them tAvo gigantic old olive millstones, one about eight feet in diameter and two feet thick, and the other of less diameter, but of more than three feet in thickness. There were, moreover, many rock tombs with loculi, the foundations of ancient Avails of immense thickness, and here and there fragments of the wall itself standing, in one place to a height of about five feet. But the most interesting find was a triangular piece of marble, on which was an inscription in a character which may possibly be ancient Syriac. It is certainly not Greek, Roman, or Hebrew, though at the first glance I thought it was the former. Unfortunately, the stone has been cut since the inscription was engraved, and there are only a feAV letters of each Avord, one below the other, but it was evidently originally a long one, consisting of many lines. I also discovered here a cistern, with four circular apertures; causing myself to be loAvered into it, I found it to be seventy feet long, supported by four pillars heAvn from the living rock, lined Avith cement, and twenty feet high, from the debris with which it was partially choked. Altogether the place is Avell worth a fuller and more careful investigation, which I hope to give it. About an hour's ride farther south is an interesting spot called the Valley of the Martyrs, which, though rarely vis ited, is well worth an excursion, not merely on account of its peculiar geological features and its great scenic attrac tions, but from the historical associations which attach to it. It was toAvards the close of the tAvelfth century that Father Brocard Avas elected vicar - general of the order \"of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel,\" whose sanctuary had been long established upon the mountain, though the members of the order had their homes in its numerous ca\\r erns, resorting to the shrine only for purposes of Avorship, while they lived as scattered ascetics in the surrounding"], [49, "THE VALLEY OF THE MARTYRS. 35 valleys. Father Brocard conceived the idea of collecting them in a monastery, and placing them under certain fixed regulations, which have ever since been the rules of the order, and which were sanctioned in a.d. 1207 by Saint Albert, Patriarch at Jerusalem, Pope's Legate, and then res ident at Acre. It was in this gorge, which subsequently became knoAvn as the Valley of the Martyrs, that Father Brocard decided to build the first monastery, attracted thither, probably, by its beauty of situation and the copiousness of its springs, one of which is called after Elijah, as tradition has it that the inhabitants in his time complained of a lack of water, and he touched the rock and caused the present stream to gush forth. It wells up from under the limestone rock, and floAvs through a channel cut for it, for a few yards, into a basin holloAved out of the solid rock, about tAvelve feet square and six feet deep; from here it Aoavs down the nar row gorge, and speedily expends itself in fertilizing some small gardens of figs, oranges, and pomegranates, which are Avedged in between the rocky hillsides, and are tended by one or two poor families who live in caves. These gardens are now claimed by the present monastery, but there seems much doubt as to the validity of their title. It is safer to dismount after passing this spring, as we noAV haA-e to cross the smooth surface of the limestone rock as we folloAV the steep path that leads up to the ruin of the old monastery, the position of Avhich is indicated by the re mains of an enormous Avail Avhich nearly reaches across the gorge, looking from below like some huge dam, and which must have concealed the monastery itself from public gaze, except from the hills above. We are noAV struck by the ex traordinary petrifactions over which Ave are passing. The path is worn deep by centuries into the soft limestone, in the sides of which appear layers of petrified twigs and branches of the bushes of a bygone period. They are per fectly white, except Avhere fractures exhibit the black flint core; but in some instances the form of the branch is perfect Avith all its twigs. Passing under the projecting buttress of the dam-like wall, Ave suddenly open on a terrace covered with vines and fruit-trees on one side, and find ourselves at"], [50, "36 HAIFA. the mouth of a large cave on the other. Entering this, if we are willing to brave the fleas \u2014 for, as it is generally in habited by an Arab family, they abound \u2014 we find that avc are in a spacious apartment supported by a column of solid rock, Avhile all around are mangers for horses, cut out of the stone. Of these Ave count fourteen, which will give some idea of the size of the cave. Probably in crusading times it was a cavalry outpost, affording, from its strong natural position and proximity to the plain of Sharon, a splendid point of vantage from Avhich to pounce upon an unsuspect ing enemy. Ascending from the cave by some steps to the terrace, we come unexpectedly upon a delicious spring overshadowed by spreading fig-trees, which fills with crystal Avater a basin that has been hollowed out of the overhanging rock; from this it trickles into another stone-cut reservoir, from whence it is led by a stone channel, holloAved by the monks, to the monastery itself, one small room of which is still standing. The rock rises perpendicularly behind, and is scooped here and there into recesses, which were formerly, doubtless, the cells of monks, while the cool shade of spreading fruit-trees, the beauty of the view, the presence of running water, and the ever- blowing southwest wind, of which they got the full benefit, must have modified to a considerable extent the austerities of their existence. There came a day, however, when their peaceful solitude was rudely disturbed. In 1238 the Saracens came upon them unexpectedly, and massacred them all, not leaving one to tell the bloody tale. There seems to be no record of the actual number who fell victims upon this occasion, but they must have been very numerous, as the Monastery of St. Brocard had become a refuge for monks from all parts of Palestine, Avho fled hither to escape the persecution to which they were being subjected in other parts of the coun try. Not content with putting them to death, the Saracens dragged their bodies clown to the Spring of Elijah, and flung them into the square reservoir there, Avhich I have already described. According to the pious chronicler of this tragic event, the spring immediately refused to Aoav, and Avhen the Christians of Acre, hearing the news, came to bury their co-"], [51, "THE VALLEY OF THE MARTYRS. 37 religionists, they found it dry. When they had completed their melancholy task, they prayed that the water might commence to run once more, Avhich it immediately did, and has never ceased since. The result of this tragedy was the practical expulsion of the order of the Carmelites from Palestine. The Monastery of St. Brocard, after its short-lived existence, fell into ruins, and more than four hundred years elapsed before the order once more secured a footing on Mount Carmel, and built a monastery upon it at the end of the promontory, which served as a hospital for the French soldiers during Napo leon's occupation of this part of the country. His hurried evacuation of Palestine involved the destruction of the mon astery and the massacre of all the wounded, to whose mem ory a monument has since been erected in the garden at tached to the present edifice. But there can be no doubt that both for picturesqueness and historical association the old ruin of the Monastery of Saint Brocard, Avhich altogether escapes the attention of the tourist and the pilgrim, is far more interesting than the modern monastery, Avhich is not fifty years old, and Avhich is about two miles distant from this old site. On the top of the hill above the ruins of the Monastery of St. Brocard is a plateau, called the Garden of Elijah, or the field of melons, which is abundantly strewn Avith geodes, or fragments of calcareous stone, having all the shape and ap pearance in many cases of petrified fruit, the crystallization of the centres Avhen they are split open having confirmed this idea, thus doubtless giving rise to the legend that Elijah on one occasion, passing through the gardens which were once situated here, asked the proprietor for some fruit. He re plied, not Avishing to comply Avith the request, that they were stones, on which the prophet, apparently in a fit of temper, said, \"Well, stones let them remain,\" and stones they have remained ever since. I found some curious spec imens so like small melons that one can well understand how this fable may have originated among an ignorant pop ulation."], [52, "THE ROCK-HEWN CEMETERY OF SHEIK ABREIK. Nazap.eth, Feb. 18. \u2014 There is a low range of hills, about five hundred feet above the sea -level, half-way between Haifa and Nazareth. It is beautifully timbered Avith oak trees, and cut up into the most charming valleys. Run ning almost due north and south, it divides the plain of Esdraelon from that of Acre. Its southern extremity, ter minating abruptly, forms a small gorge with the Carmel range, through which the Kishon forces its way to the sea. It was during a heavy rain-storm a week ago that I ap proached the ford of this riA-er from Haifa. It was not Avithout trepidation, for the stream had been so swollen by recent rains that communication with the interior had been interrupted. It Avas doubtful whether the passage of this river, which almost dries up in summer, Avould not involve a ducking. I therefore prudently requested my companion to precede me into the yellow, swirling stream, and although the water came up to our saddle-bags, the horses managed to get across Avithout losing their footing. Then we gal loped into the oak-woods. The sun broke out from behind the clouds, and we determined to prosecute our search for certain caATes, of the existence of which we had heard, and which, owing to the state of the weather, we had almost decided to abandon. Leaving the high-road to Nazareth to the right, we fol lowed a path for about half an hour Avhich took us to the A-illage of Sheik Abreik. It was a miserable collection of mud hovels, in the muddiest of which dwelt the sheik. After much palaver and promises of abundant backsheesh we got him to admit the existence of the caverns of which we were in search, and persuaded him to be our guide to them. The first Avas called by the Arabs \"The Cave of"], [53, "THE ROCK-HEWN CEMETERY OF SHEIK ABREIK. 39 Hell.\" Its entrance seemed to justify the ill-omened appel lation. It Avas a steep, sloping tunnel into the bowels of the earth, just large enough to admit the passage of a man's body. To slide into this feet foremost after a heavy rain involved a coating of mud from top to toe. After going doAvn a few yards Ave found a chamber in Avhich we could stand erect. Here Ave lighted our candle and looked about us. We found that it Avas the first of a series of similar chambers opening one into another. Each contained loculi, hewn out of the solid rock. The entrances to these cham bers were arched. The pilasters on each side of the entrance were in some cases ornamented Avith rude sculptures and decorated with designs in a yellow pigment. These Avere in the form of curves, scrolls, and circles, and were carried over the roof. Each chamber Avas about ten feet long by six feet wide, and on an average contained three tombs or loculi, one across the chamber, facing the entrance, and one on each side. There do not seem ever to have been lids to these stone receptacles for the corpses. The bodies were embalmed, Avrapped in cloths, as Ave read in Scriptural accounts of burials, notably in that of our Saviour. \"Each in his narrow cell forever laid,\" they re mained undisturbed until rude hands, ages afterwards, \"rolled away the stone from the mouth of the cave\" and rifled the contents. Some of the entrances to the chambers had been com pletely filled up. In such cases the partition wall of rock had been broken through. Some of the chambers Avere larger than others, and there were two tiers of loculi. In order to get from one chamber to another it was often neces sary to drag yourself along at full length upon the ground. In one case the roof had been broken through into a cham ber above, and this probably led to more. I had not time fully to explore this most curious and in teresting spot. Examinations of this sort in the middle of a long day's ride are very fatiguing. The effort of scram bling about on all fours, or after the fashion of the serpent, is very great, and makes you very dirty. In the absence of a string you are haunted by the idea of not being able to find your Avay back, to say nothing of the chance of sticking in"], [54, "HAIFA. \u25a0JO one of these narrow passages. Altogether, I entered about fifteen different chambers, and doubtless the others did not differ in any important particulars. I am afraid, hoAvever, that I was not the first to discover them, but that this honour rests with Captain Conder, Royal Engineers, of the Pales tine Exploration Fund. The sheik told us he had once be fore guided a foreigner to this locality, and on the next cave we A-isited we found the letters R. E. scratched in red paint on the rock, Avhich under these circumstances can only mean Royal Engineers. The next caA-e was a much more comfortable one to exam ine, though not nearly so interesting. You could walk about it comfortably, but there was no ornamentation. The cham bers Avere larger, but there Avere only five or six of them. The stone coffins had, in many instances, been completely destroyed, but the massive stone columns, or rather blocks, of living rock which supported the roof were finer than those in the \"CaA7e of Hell.\" Perhaps it owed its more dilapidated condition to the largeness of its entry, and its proximity to another huge cave Avhich had evidently in crusading times been converted into a Christian place of worship. According to a rough measurement obtained by pacing it, the nave Avas seventy feet by thirty, the apse eighteen by twenty-one, and tAvo apse - shaped transepts about twenty by eighteen ; but these were very much filled Avith rubbish. The height of the cave was about thirty feet. The whole formed a subterranean church, which, in its perfect condition, Avhen entered from the hillside, must have presented a very imposing appearance. On the slope of the bill, not far from this cave, was the car\\-ed pedestal of a granite column, and near it a handsome stone sarcopha gus. Instead of going back to the Nazareth road after finish ing our examination of this interesting spot, we made for a hill on the summit of which we saw some large blocks of stone betokening ruins. Here we came upon a native exca vation, evidently very recent. Indeed, Ave heard later that it had only been abandoned the week before. The na tives occasionally find an unopened tomb, and dig into it for treasure. It was useless to attempt to disabuse their"], [55, "THE ROCK-HEWN CEMETERY OF SHEIK ABREIK. 4\\ minds of the idea that Ave Avere treasure-hunters. On ask ing them what they had found, they said, some red glass bottles, which they had broken to discover what they con tained. They had also found three jars, one containing ashes, one earth, and one was empty. These they had also smashed. It Avas enough to make one's mouth water to hear of the destruction of these curiosities so very recently. I implored them if they found any more not to break them, but to bring them to me. They laughed, and promised to do so, saying, at the same time, \" They are so very old that they are not worth anything.\" This cave was evidently an important one, but the natives, finding nothing but the glass and the jars, had blocked up the entrance again, and I had to put off the examination of it to some future time. On the top of the hill there Avere several sarcophagi, some, cof fins heAvn out of the living rock on the surface, with the stone lid at the side. At one place I saAv a huge stone lid about eight feet long, tAvo feet six inches broad at its base, and the same in height, but coming up to a ridge, which was evidently still covering the mortal remains which had origi nally been placed beneath it. The position of this I have also marked, and propose, at some future time, to remove it by gunpowder and see Avhat is below. Had it not been necessary to push on in order to reach Nazareth before night, I Avould have lingered longer at these ruins, AA'hich are called Zebda by the natives. They are worthy of a full examination. The Avhole rocky sum mit of the hill is evidently honeycombed with cave tombs, many of which had not yet been opened. One of these, some miles farther on towards Nazareth, especially attracted my attention. A huge circular stone about two feet in diame ter had been rolled into the carved stone entrance to the cave, and become tightly Avedged. All the efforts of the na tives to remove it, and the marks of such efforts were visi ble, had evidently been unavailing. It needed a very small charge of dynamite to remove the obstacle Avhich had so successfully resisted the barbarian ingenuity of ages. This I had arranged to do, but on the day fixed for the purpose persistent rain disappointed me. However, it is a treat in store."], [56, "42 HAIFA, The first entrance into one of these old Jewish tomb caverns will be an exciting episode, but there is an amount of suspicion and jealousy on the part of the natives Avhich will render prudence and circumspection necessary if any at tempt of this sort is to be carried out with success. The whole plain of Esdraelon, on the verge of which this ruin is situated, as well as part of the hills behind, is now all OAvned by one rich firm of Syrian bankers, who draw an annual income of about $200,000 a year from it. They OAvn practically about five thousand human beings as well, who form [the population of thirty villages, which are in their hands. I found no more potent talisman in inducing the natives to comply with my request than to mention the name of \"Sursuk,\" and imply that I had the honour of his acquaintance. No despot exercises a more autocratic power over the liberties or the lives of his subjects than does this millionaire landed proprietor, who continues annually to add to his territory till the whole of Galilee seems in danger of falling into his hands. This part of the country, Iioav ever, is at present beginning to attract the attention of foreigners, and it is to be hoped that before long he may find rivals in the field who will do more to improATe the condition of the peasantry, and introduce methods of agriculture which may make them more independent of the money-lenders who now make their profit by sucking their very life-blood."], [57, "EASTER AMONG THE MELCHITES. Haifa, April 2. \u2014 The population of Haifa, which amounts to about six thousand souls, consists, so far as religious dis- tinctions are concerned, of Moslems, Roman Catholics \u2014 here called \"Latins\" \u2014 orthodox Greeks, and Greek Catholics, or Melchites. Of these the latter are the most numerous. This toAvn may be considered the stronghold of the Mel- chite schismatics. They are more influential here than in any other toAvn in Syria. They compose two thirds of its entire population. Originally orthodox Greek, they owe their origin to the missionary efforts of Romish priests and Jesuits during the last tAvo centuries. As the object has been to gain partisans, more pains have been taken to ob- tain nominal submission to the authority of the pope than any real change of doctrine or ritual. To this day, Lazar- ists, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits are active in their efforts to make proselytes to this sect from the orthodox Greek Church. They allow them to retain their indepen- dence of Rome in many particulars. Thus it is governed by a patriarch at Damascus who owes allegiance to the pope. Mass is celebrated in Arabic, they administer the sacrament in both kinds, they retain their Oriental calendar, and their priests may be married men, though they may not marry after ordination. They differ from the orthodox Greek Church in this, that they take the Romanist vieAV of the procession of the Holy Spirit. They believe in Pur- gatory, they eat fish in Lent, and acknoAvledge the papal su- premacy. Otherwise they haA-e made no change in passing from one jurisdiction to the other. As perv-erts they are naturally intensely hated by the orthodox Greeks, and when disturbances take place between Moslems and Christians, the Greek orthodox are generally to be found siding Avith the Moslems against Roman Catholics and Melchites."], [58, "44 HAIFA. To this sect belong some of the Avealthiest and most aris tocratic families in Syria. As the ordinary traveller is not often brought into contact with them, I was not sorry for the opportunity Avhich my residence furnished me of Avit nessing their Easter observances. At midnight on the Sat urday preceding Easter Sunday the festival is announced by a great consumption of gunpowder. An uproar Avhich would do credit to a prolonged skirmish lasts till the early mass. The Melchite church is the largest and most impos ing in Haifa. It is enclosed in a courtyard, round one side of Avhich runs a balcony. At an early hour on Sunday morning the whole population turns out in its grandest at tire. The men wear short embroidered jackets, with long sleeves slashed to the elbow, AA-aistcoats of brilliant colours and innumerable buttons, bright-coloured sashes, and baggy trousers. The women are in floAving white robes, which, draAvn over their heads, are held under their chins, only partially concealing their gay head-dresses sparkling with coins, and their low-cut vests, gaudy with gold or silver em broidery. The children are especially subjects of decora tion in costume, and strut about in the brightest of gar ments, plentifully ornamented with gold lace and flowers. The narrow street leading to the church is tolerably crowded as we force our way along until we suddenly meet a loud-voiced procession, the priests, accompanied by chor isters, keeping up a discordant nasal chant as they march round the church with the image of the Saviour on a cruci fix, Avith red and green banners, and with swinging censers, folloAved by a miscellaneous crowd, all carrying tapers. This occurs three times. Aftenvards the church square fills with a noisy crowd of men. The windows and housetops Avhich command a view of it are filled Avith. female specta tors, who are not allowed to mingle freely with the men. On the stairs leading to the housetops are clustered the tawdrily dressed little girls, upon whom no such restriction is imposed, and then, if I may be pardoned the expression, the religious fun may be said to begin. It consists in let ting off squibs, crackers, pistols, and guns till the spectator is almost deafened. The men form themselves in a circle so large that it fills the Avhole courtyard, each man throw-"], [59, "EASTER AMONG THE MELCHITES. 45 ing his arms right and left round his neighbour's neck, and, lifting up his voice in a discordant scream, which is sup posed to have some musical connection with the screams of all his neighbours. It is a dull dance, although noisy. Ev erybody makes ungainly steps in time, yelling and leering at each other in an idiotic manner, and letting off their guns when impelled to do so by excitement. As far as I could make out, their songs were rather of an amorous than a re ligious character. When this entertainment came to an end a seedy-looking character entered the arena with an open Bible in his hand. He proceeded up the stairs to the open balcony, whither he was folloAved by the armed crowd Avho had been dancing. These ranged themselves right and left beside him, and he commenced in Arabic to read in a loud voice a chapter from the Gospel of St. John. When he had read a certain num ber of verses he paused, and about a hundred guns went off in a sort of feu dejoie. Then he read on, Avhile his audience loaded their guns. Then he paused again. They fired again, and so on all through the chapter, thus emphasizing as it were the most striking passages by periodical explosions of gunpowder. When this was over the church bell rang, and some priests with round, high-crowned hats and locks flow ing over their shoulders made their appearance. I was told by a Melchite friend that there was no use in going to church now, as everybody intended to go and get drunk and pay visits, and indulge in more dancing of a less re strained character, but that there would be a better mass on the following day, because the French consul Avas going to attend in full uniform, and everybody would be there. This Easter festival lasts three days. The merriment in creases and culminates on the last day, at the expiration of Avhich everybody has given proof of his religious devotion by arriving at a blind state of intoxication. When in this sanctified condition disturbances not unfrequently occur be tween these Christian worshippers and the Moslems, in whose mind Christian religious ceremonial is inseparably connect ed with drunken riots and wild orgies. The Caimakam or Turkish governor of the town, fearing that the strict ob servance of Easter according to their custom on the part of"], [60, "HAIFA. 46 the Melchites might lead to these results, issued an order that on Easter Monday and the day following no firing was to be allowed, but the Melchites replied to the police officer charged with enforcing this order, that they had no inten tion of obeying it. A serious difficulty might have occurred were it not for the intervention of the English and French vice-consuls, who gave the Melchites to understand that the Turkish authority must be respected. It was a curious il lustration of the state of Turkish administration here that a Turkish governor should have to appeal to foreign consuls in order to secure compliance on the part of Turkish sub jects with his own orders. When I attended mass on the following day there was no firing. With the exception of the French consul, my friends, and myself, the whole con gregation stood. Three priests officiated at an altar unusu ally tawdry, and a group of men and boys kept up a sten torian nasal chant from first to last. They were accom panied by an orchestra of two men, each of whom had a pair of common steel table knives, with which they kept up a most ear-splitting clatter on the rim of a copper bowl, that might on ordinary occasions have been used for salad. The incense-swingers puffed fumes of incense into the faces of the French consul and myself as being honoured guests, and a priest brought him an open Bible to kiss, but ab stained from offering it to me \u2014 on religious grounds best known to himself. Then he painted a good many people Avith holy water, using a piece of cotton put on the end of a wire. Then there Avas the usual procession and elevation of the Host, and the more devout members prostrated them selves and kissed the flagstones of the church. The sacra ment was administered, the bread and wine being mixed to gether in a silver cup, which was held over an embroidered napkin stretched between two boys, so that none of the contents fell to the ground as the priest put the teaspoon ful into the mouths of those AA-ho knelt before him. The Avomen did not seem to need it, as they Avere all bottled up in a gallery, and could only see or be seen through a lat tice-work. The service came to an end, and the people divided to al low the French consul, Avho, with his cocked hat and gold"], [61, "EASTER AMONG THE MELCHITES. 47 lace, had been the figurehead of the ceremony, to march out in state. These French consuls are all A-ery pious men in Syria. The French government, which has been ejecting monks and nuns and closing religious establishments, and making laws against religious instruction in France, is \\-ery particular about the religious principles of their representa tives in Syria; as a member of the French government re cently remarked, \" Religion is only useful as an article of export.\" Thus, the French consul-general at Beyrout goes to mass on Easter Sunday with the Roman Catholics. On Easter Monday he attends mass with the Maronites, and on Tuesday he Avorships with the Melchites, thus dividing his favours equally, and patronizing with great impartiality any heresies he may happen to come across. As the correct thinsj among*; the Melchites after bein**? at church is to go and \" have something to drink,\" I folloAved the usual custom and paid a visit to my Melchite friend's family. The ladies of his establishment, in gorgeous attire, pressed beer and wine and raki, and sweetmeats and cakes and coffee, upon our enfeebled digestion. We smoked nar ghiles, and enlightened our minds upon Melchite manners and customs. As I passed through the outskirts of the town on my return home, I came upon the male Melchite popula tion indulging in their circular dance and their discordant chants. They continued on the following day, stimulated by a plentiful indulgence in intoxicating liquors, thus to glorify God, and to celebrate the resurrection of the Saviour among men."], [62, "THE JEWISH QUESTION TN PALESTINE. Haifa, April 17. \u2014 The exceptional interest which, in the minds of many people, attaches to the Jewish question in Palestine must be my excuse for noAV alluding to it. Al though, in consequence of the strenuous opposition of the Turkish government, the tide of emigration into the coun try has been checked, the desire of the Russian and Rou manian Jews to escape from the persecution to which they are subjected in Europe to the Holy Land has in no degree diminished. On the contrary, colonization societies continue to be formed and funds collected both in Russia and Rou mania, and the English government has lately remonstrated with the Porte on the breach of treaty Avhich the prohibi tion of JeAvs to settle in Palestine involves, Avith what suc cess remains to be seen. The diplomatic action of the pres ent government of England is by no means of a robust kind. Curiously enough, the Russian policy on this inter esting question appears to be undergoing a change. The Russian government seems disposed to espouse in Turkey the cause of the race which it oppresses so unmercifully at home. M. de Nelidoff, the Russian Minister at Constanti nople, has lately addressed a note to the Porte, in Avhich he complains that the imperial authorities at Jaffa place every possible obstacle in the way of Jewish pilgrims from Russia Avho wish to disembark there in order to proceed to Jerusa lem. The Porte has replied that no restriction whatever has been placed upon pilgrimages to the Holy City, and that the JeAvs, like everybody else, are free to go there. The Porte, however, draws attention to the imperial decree, re cently published, which strictly prohibits the provincial authorities from allowing Jews, under any condition Avhat soever, to settle in Palestine, and states that should any"], [63, "THE JEWISH QUESTION IN PALESTINE. 49 Jews, in spite of such express prohibition, seek to establish themselves there, the laAv of exclusion would be rigorously enforced. But all foreigners, of any nationality Avhatsoever, have a treaty right to settle in Palestine. The proof of Avhich is that American and German colonists have estab- lished themselves here; that a society has been formed in Petersburg for promoting colonization in Palestine by Rus- sian Christian subjects. A Jew, therefore, who is a Rus- sian subject has manifestly as good a right to buy a piece of land in the country and settle upon it as a Christian. At this moment the Russian Consul - General at Beyrout is Avarmly espousing the cause of a Russian Jew colonist, who forms one of a colony of tAventy-five Russian and Rouma- nian JeAV families Avho have bought land and settled not far from the Lake of Tiberias. A Moslem youth wishing to ex- amine his revolver, Avhich the Jcav refused to alloAV him to do, the weapon accidentally went off in the struggle, and mortally Avounded the Moslem. The whole Mussulman vil- lage was up in arms, and it Avas only by the exercise of much tact on the part of the native Arab Jews that a gen- eral massacre was averted. The young Jew was throAvn into prison, although it Avas recognized as an accident, and has been confined in a filthy cell for more than four months. His case Avas Avarmly taken up by the Russian authorities, and the plea of the Porte is that he had already signed a paper declaring himself an Ottoman subject. The Russian officials reply to this that he has since travelled under his Russian passport, has been recognized as a Russian subject by the authorities, and that the Arabic paper he signed Avas erroneously represented to him as being only a permission from the local authority to buy land and build a house. There the matter stands at present, and a warm correspon- dence is taking place on the subject. It is significant as shoAving the attitude which the Russians are assuming in the matter. The Russian vice-consul here not long since brought some Russian immigrant Jews on shore in spite of the remonstrances of the local authorities. It is evident that if the Russian government adopts the policy of encour aging JeAvish immigration into Palestine, and of protecting the immigrants Avhen here, they will have obtained an excellent 4"], [64, "50 HAIFA. excuse for political interference in the country. This was always the danger, and might haA-e been avoided by a more enlightened and far-sighted policy on the part of the Porte. Had the Turkish government encouraged Jewish immigration on the condition of every immigrant becoming a Turkish sub ject, they would have added to the population by an indus trious class of people, Avho would speedily have increased its material prosperity, while the government might have so controlled and regulated the immigration and the coloni zation that there would have been nothing to fear from it. By adopting this policy they Avould avoid possible compli cations with foreign powers, while they would at the same time gain the sympathy of the most enlightened among them, by affording to a suffering and persecuted race an asylum where their presence would not only be harmless, but in the highest degree advantageous to the Turkish pro\\- ince they had chosen for their home. Of late the pros pects of both the Jewish agricultural colonies Avhich have been established in Galilee have improved. The assiduity and perseverance with which, in spite of their inexperience, of the obstacles thrown in their way, and of the hardships inseparable from settlement in a new country, they have la boured on the soil, the progress they have made, and their prospects for the future, all go to show that under favoura ble auspices colonies of this nature cannot but succeed ; and this belief has taken too firm a hold on the Jewish mind both in Russia and Roumania for it to be lightly abandoned. At present the pressure on the part of the Roumanian Jews to emigrate hither is greater than in Russia, Avhere there has been a lull in the persecution; but unfortunately the Roumanian government has no diplomatic agents in these parts, and is indifferent to the fate of the Jews Avho leave their country. In former times the British government had a habit of taking waifs and strays of this description under its protection. Thus, nearly the whole Jewish community at Tiberias were originally Russian refugees who emigrated to Palestine thirty years ago, and applied for British protec tion, a privilege Avhich Lord Palmerston promptly granted them, and to this day they travel Avith British passports, and pay five shillings a year to renew their registration,"], [65, "THE JEWISH QUESTION IN PALESTINE. 51 which secures them the protection of the British consul. If any government were philanthropic enough to adopt a simi- lar plan noAA-, there would be no difficulty in these poor Roumanians entering the country and settling here ; but it is a course Avhich naturally involves responsibilities, and opens a door to possible complications, and in these practi- cal days people's sufferings, unless something is to be made out of them, do not furnish a sufficient justification to com- pensate for the amount of trouble which they might involve. Meantime the agricultural enterprise of the Jcavs in Pales- tine has to contend not merely with local opposition, but with the unaccountable indifference with AA-hich their efforts in this direction are regarded, with a few brilliant excep- tions, by their Western coreligionists. At present the seven or eight colonies which exist are all composed of Russian or Roumanian refugees, but the best material for farmers is to be found among those Jews who have been bred and born in the country, Avho are already Turkish sub- jects, Avho speak the language, and are familiar Avith all the local conditions, and who are now mendicants, subsisting on that most pernicious institution, the Haluka, which, Avhile it is a tax upon the whole JeAvish nation outside of Palestine, is a fruitful source of pillage, contention, and sloth, among its recipients at Jerusalem and Safed. Out of some seven thousand Jews resident at the latter place, many are Avilling to give up all claim to the Haluka, and establish themselves as agriculturists, if they could be assisted in the first in- stance Avith the necessary capital. With some of these the experiment has been tried on a small scale, and they have proved more successful farmers in every way than the for- eign immigrants, Avhile, as they are natives of the country and subjects of the government, the latter does not interfere Avith their operations, as in the case of the foreigners. Un- der these circumstances, it is a thousand pities that Western JeAvs do not come to their assistance. They would confer thereby a twofold benefit upon their race. They would as sist the industry and enterprise of their coreligionists, Avhile they Avould undermine that system of religious mendicancy Avhich is a disgrace to any religion, and they would de prive thereby their adversaries of the right to say, as"], [66, "52 HAIFA. they do noAAr, that the success which attends missionary efforts at proselytism is due chiefly to the fact that Jews abroad are indifferent to the best interests of such of their race as have chosen for their home the land of their an cestors."], [67, "\"HOLY PLACES\" IN GALILEE. Nazaeetii, May 1. \u2014 Talking the other day to a Francis can monk on the prospects of his religion and of the prop aganda for the faith which his order is making in these parts, he informed me that much depended upon the resto ration of \"holy places,\" Avith a view to increasing their im portance and popularity, for practically the most effective agent for the conversion of infidels is hard cash, and the increase of expenditure means the increase of converts. Of course he did not put it in this undisguised language, but it is distinctly a great pecuniary advantage to a native village that it should become a centre of religious attraction to pil grims and tourists, and that money should be spent in building churches and monasteries, and otherwise civilizing remote and outlying localities where the inhabitants would remain paupers but for the sanctity of the spot upon Avhich they are fortunate enough to live. Indeed, the latter are acute enough to understand that they can frequently make a good thing of it by the exploitation of the rivalries of op posing creeds, and they cleverly change from one to the other, when they perceive that it would be to their advan tage to do so. Thus, not long ago, no fewer than a hun dred and twenty of the inhabitants of the village of Kefr Kenna, situated only a feAV miles from this place, who be longed to the orthodox Greek Church, became Roman Cath olics, and as a reAvard for this proof of their spiritual intel ligence a Franciscan monastery is now in process of con struction. The small village is deriving no little profit in consequence, to say nothing of the fact that it will draAV pilgrims to visit the historic locality hoav that they will be received there by the holy fathers. For both the Greek and the Catholic churches have hitherto assumed the truth of a tradition to the effect that Kefr Kenna Avas the village"], [68, "54 HAIFA in which the miracle took place of the conversion of Avater into wine \u2014 that it is none other, indeed, than the Cana of Galilee \u2014 and they show you the house Avhere the marriage took place, and the stone water-pots, to prove it. The fact that it is a matter of great doubt Avhether it be Cana of Galilee at all, does not affect the question where religious faith is concerned, but it seems a pity that the inhabitants of Kana el Jelil, commonly called Khurbet Kana, should not be put up to the fact that they are possibly the pos sessors of the site of the veritable Cana, and may have got a \" holy place \" worth thousands of dollars to them if turned to proper account. I will not trouble my readers with quotations from Scewelf (a.d. 1102), from Marinus Sanutus in the fourteenth century, from Andrichomius, and from De Vogue and Dr. Robin son in later times, to prove that this may be so. The fact that it is admitted by many modern geographers would be enough for the inhabitants of Khurbet Kana or for the Greek Church, if they wished to revenge themsehres upon their Catholic rivals. These latter have made another still more happy hit quite lately at Sefurieh, the ancient Sep phoris, distant about three miles from Khurbet Kana, in reviving there an almost forgotten \" holy place.\" The merit of its discovery seems to rest with Saint Helena, who made a pilgrimage to Palestine in the fourth century, and to whose ardent piety, vivid imagination, and energetic exertions are due most of those traditional spots connected with the life of Christ which attract pilgrims to the Holy Land. On what authority she decided that a certain house in Sepphoris \u2014 called in those days Dioc\u00e6sarea \u2014 had been the abode of Joachim and Anna, the parents of the Virgin, we are not told, nor hoAv, upon descending into details, she was further enabled to identify the exact spot upon Avhich the Virgin received the salutation of the angel; suffice it to say that the proofs Avere so convincing to her deA-out and august mind that she stamped it with her sanction, and a cathedral was afterwards erected upon it. In the course of centuries this edifice crumbled away, the site, curiously enough, became the manure and rubbish heap of the village, and under the mound thus formed was buried nearly all"], [69, "\"HOLY PLACES\" IN GALILEE. 55 that remained of this ancient cathedral. Only the high arch of the middle aisle and the lower ones of the side aisles still testified to the modern tourist the ancient proportions of the edifice. Within the last tAvo years, however, it has occurred to the Franciscans to make exca\\-ations here, with the view of re storing the ancient cathedral and of renewing its fame as a holy place, for, to all good Catholics, it must ever be a mat ter of the deepest interest to see where the angel saluted the Virgin, and Avhere her parents lived, and to press their lips to the ancient stones thus halloAved. Moreover, an in flux of pilgrims to this point will ha\\-e a threefold effect. It Avill bring money to the Franciscan treasury ; it will probably be the means of converting the resident local pop ulation, who have been fanatic Moslems, but who, I was as sured by my ecclesiastical informant, had benefited so much by the money already spent, that they were only deterred by fear, and by its not being quite enough, from declaring their conversion to Christianity to-morroAv; and, thirdly, it would give the French government another holy place to protect. For it is by the manufacture and protection of holy places that republican France extends and consoli dates her influence in these parts. It was Avith a vieAV of seeing what had been done that I determined to ride over to Sefurieh and from there take a line of my OAvn through the Avoods to the Bay of Acre, in stead of returning to the coast by the regular road across the plain of Esdraelon. Passing Cana and the Christian vil lage of Reineh, Avhere there is an old Avell with a sculptured sarcophagus, Ave leave to our right a Moslem \" holy place,\" called Mashad, where there is a conspicuous Avely, or Moslem shrine. This spot Moslem as well as Christian tradition de clares to be the tomb of Jonah. This tradition is based on the fact that the prophet is said in the Bible to be of Gath \u2014 Hepher \u2014 and this site is pretty well identified with that of the modern Mashad. There can be little doubt that these Moslem welies are the modern representatives of those \"high places\" Avhich the ancient Jews were so constantly punished for erecting. They seem, indeed, to differ in no very marked degree from the \"holy places\" of the present day."], [70, "56 HAIFA In an hour more we are galloping up the grassy slope on the side of Avhich are the mud hovels of the modern popu lation, Avhose conversion is so imminent, and the summit of Avhich is crowned Avith the picturesque ruins of a crusading castle, reared upon foundations which are evidently of a far anterior date. This building is about fifty feet square, and from the top, Avhich we reach by a dilapidated stair, Ave haA-e a magnificent view of the surrounding country, the Buttauf, formerly the plain of Zebulon, at our feet \u2014 at this time of year a sheet of water \u2014 Avith the high range of the Jebel Safed behind, and bounding the horizon westward the sea-line of the Bay of Acre, with the wooded hills, through Avhich lies my proposed route, intervening. On the side of the hill near the village is the church in process of restora tion, and in the courtyard which has been recently built in front of it, where the rubbish mound lately stood, are no less than a dozen syenite columns, some standing to a height of twelve or fifteen feet, some prostrate, while their capitals and entablatures are streAvn around. A small chapel has been fitted up in one of the side aisles, Avhere a priest from Nazareth comes every Sunday to perform mass to the Arab and his Avife who are left in charge during the week, and who at present form the Avhole congregation. The priest told me that many more handsome columns were in a sub terranean part of the church which had recently been dis covered, but which I could not visit, on account of debris. He also pointed out the fact 'that the pillars AA-hich sup ported the arches were (divided into five sections, so built that they might actually enclose the ancient Avails of the house of Joachim and Anna. What renders this excavation interesting is, that as Sep phoris was, at the time of Christ, the principal Roman city and fortress of Galilee, some relics of a date anterior to that of the church itself may very likely be discovered. The former importance of the town may be fairly estimated by the extent of its ancient rock cemetery, which lies about a mile to the eastAvard, and which I visited. Here abound caves with loculi for the dead, sarcophagi, either cut into the living rock, with their stone lids still upon them, or else detached and strewn like huge water-troughs over the"], [71, "\"\u25a0HOLY PLACES\" IN GALILEE. 57 rocky area, immense cisterns, and rock -cut steps, and a quarter of a mile distant is a wonderful work of Roman engineering skill in the shape of an aqueduct many miles long, Avhich supplied the citadel with water, which it is supposed continues to Sheik Abreik, a distance of ten miles, and which here tunnels through the hill for a quarter of a mile. The roof has in places fallen in, and exposes to vieAV the canal itself, Avhich is about twenty feet deep, with sides beautifully cemented. This subterranean aqueduct has only been recently discovered by the Palestine Explo ration Fund Survey, and is quite unknoAvn to tourists, though the Avhole place is well worth visiting. Leaving it Avith regret, for it required a longer examina tion than I Avas able to give it, I struck off past the lovely springs of Sefurieh, where a copious stream gushes out full bloAvn from its source, to fertilize a valley rich Avith olive and fig gardens \u2014 a spot celebrated in crusading annals as the scene of many skirmishes, in some of which Richard Cceur de Lion distinguished himself so much that his name is still handed doAvn in tradition among the natives. Crossing Avooded hills, we find that every step opens new surprise* upon us of scenery and of discovery, for these wild forest recesses have never been thoroughly explored. First we came upon a group of prostrate columns on which we found inscriptions, so Avorn, however, that we Avere unable to de cipher them, but the native Avho Avas Avith us told us that the clump of old trees which overhung them bore the name of \" Trees of the Bridegroom,\" suggestive of Baal-worship and a holy place of antiquity. Then we examined two hill tops covered with cave tombs, and strewn Avith massive and overgroAvn remains hitherto undiscovered. One of these Avas called Jissy and the other Hamitz. The largest of the caves contained three chambers Avith loculi. The entrances Avere carved. Not far from them I found another group of columns, and on them managed to trace the letters IMP. AVR., evidently standing for Imperator Aurelian, which would make them date from the third century after Christ. So, Avinding through rocky, wooded dells, Ave reached Bethle hem of Galilee, the modern Beit Lahm, where there were the remains of an ancient subterranean aqueduct or sarcophagus"], [72, "58 HAIFA. and the fragment of a column, and on through more glassy glades, finding our way by instinct, for we were without a guide; but Ave had a better chance of stumbling upon un discovered ruins this Avay, and AA-hatever path we folloAved was sure in the end to lead us somewhere ; moreover, the vieAV guided us from the hill-tops, and our compass AA'hen we were in the valleys. I quite regretted when at last Ave suddenly emerged from these old oak woods \u2014 alas ! so rapidly being destroyed by the charcoal burners \u2014 and found ourselves on the edge of a hill o\\-erlooking the plain of the Kishon, across Avhich a rapid ride of three hours brought us to our journey's end, and completed one of the most delightful rides it has ever been my fortune to make in this country."], [73, "PROGRESS IN PALESTINE. Haifa, May 16. \u2014 Considering the number, of tourists, both American and English, who annually visit the Holy Land, I have been much struck with the erroneous impres sion which still continues to prevail in regard to its availabil ity as a field of colonization, and as an opening for foreign enterprise and capital. For some time past a discussion has been taking place in the JeAvish papers on both sides of the Atlantic, in Avhich the merits of Palestine from this point of view have been can vassed, and I can only account for the extraordinary inac curacies Avhich have characterized the arguments of the dis putants, by the supposition that they have derived their in formation from sources Avhich, owing to the changes which have taken place in the country during the last few years, may now be considered obsolete. Readers will be surprised to learn that almost every acre of the plain of Esdraelon is at this moment in the highest state of cultivation; that it is perfectly safe to ride across it unarmed in any direction, as I can testify; that, so far from plundering and despoiling villages, the few Bedouins, whose \"black tabernacles\" are now confined to the southern margin of the plain, haAre, in their turn, be come the plundered and despoiled, for they are all reduced to the position of being subject to inexorable landlords, who charge them exorbitantly for the land which they oc cupy, and for Avhich they pay in hard cash, under penalty of instant ejection, which is ruthlessly enforced, so that the inhabitants of the villages, with Avhich the plain is noAV dotted, live in perfect security, though more than twren ty years have elapsed since it Avas predicted that \"in ten years more there will not be an inhabited village in Es draelon.\" It looks to-day like a huge green lake of Avaving"], [74, "HAIFA. 60 wheat, with its village-crowned mounds rising from it like islands; and it presents one of the most striking pictures of luxuriant fertility which it is possible to conceive. When, therefore, I read the other day, as an argument why colonies should not be established in this part of Galilee, a description of the dangers Avhich Avould attend any such ex periment,! was amazed at the temerity of the assertion. But as so much attention is just now devoted to the consideration of the agricultural capabilities of Palestine, I think it only right that the delusions which evidently continue to exist on the subject should be dissipated with as little delay as possible. The fact is, that nearly the Avhole plain of Esdraelon is di vided betAveen tAvo great proprietors, the Sultan himself, who has recently acquired a great part of the eastern portion of it, and the Sursocks, the richest bankers in Syria, who are resident in Beyrout, and who own nearly all the villages ex tending from the foot of the Nazareth hills to the sea. Some idea of the amount of the grain which is annually grown on their portion of the plain of Esdraelon alone may be gathered from the fact that Mr. Sursock himself told me a few weeks ago that the cost of transporting his last year's crop to Haifa and Acre amounted to $50,000. This was said as illustrating the necessity of a railway across the plain, Avith a view of cheapening the cost of transport, as, owing to the Sultan having property here, it has be come desirable in his majesty's interest. A concession has recently been granted to these Beyrout capitalists for the purpose of constructing a line which shall connect the Bay of Acre and the two ports upon it Avith the great grain growing province to the east of the Jordan, called the Hauran, from Avhich region thousands of camels loaded with cereals come annually to Acre and Haifa. As I write the engineers are starting to commence the surveys of this line, which will run right through to the cen tre of the plain of Esdraelon, and open up a great extent of new country lying in the hills behind it, which will now find an easier access to the sea, Avhile the whole of Galilee will benefit from so important a means of communication. In deed, it is a remarkable fact that while every province in Turkey has been steadily retrograding during the last few"], [75, "PROGRESS IN PALESTINE. 61 years, Palestine alone has been rapidly developing in agri cultural and material prosperity. In Haifa and its neigh bourhood land has risen threefold in value during the last five years, Avhile the export and import trade has increased with a remarkable rapidity, and the population has doubled Avithin ten years. Indeed, the population of the whole of Palestine shows an increase during that period, more partic ularly OAving to immigration within the last year or two. The consequence is that although, so far as security for life and property is concerned, there is still much to be desired, great progress has been made, and with a more energetic government the country might be rendered as safe as any in the world. As it is, the Bedouins are being gradually pushed east of the Jordan, and it is noAV becoming more and more rare for an Arab encampment to be seen in the neighbourhood of the more settled and prosperous part of the country. There are, of course, villages Avhere the inhabitants have a bad reputa tion, and, as a rule in the establishment of new colonies, proximity to these should be avoided ; but fertile lands, near peaceable villages, removed from all risk of Arab in cursion, and which can be purchased at a Ioav price, abound; and I know of no more profitable investment of money, Avere the government favorable to it, whether by Jew or Gentile, than is furnished by a judiciously selected tract of this de scription. In proof of Avhich may be cited the extraordinary Avealth which has been accumulated by the Sursocks alone, Avho now OAvn thousands of acres of the finest land in Pales tine, and who purchase numerous neAV villages every year. At the same time it must be admitted that, practically, the purchase of land in this country is attended with many dif ficulties. It is either held by villages in a communal man ner, or in very small patches, many of which have several owners. In the first case the Avhole village, Avith its lands, must be purchased, an operation involving many official formalities, or the co-proprietors of the small patches have to agree upon the amount of the purchase-money, and then to show a clear title and the payment of all arrears of taxes. As a rule the purchase of any considerable extent of land in volves negotiations extending OA-er seA-eral months, and"], [76, "62 HAIFA. strangers unused to the ways of the country and the methods by Avhich official routine may be expedited and obstacles re moA-ed are apt to meet with many disappointments. On the other hand, owing to official corruption, immense tracts of land fit for cultivation, but Avhich are unoccupied owing to the sparseness of the population generally, may, through favouritism and backsheesh, be obtained at an almost nomi nal price. The same erroneous impression prevails in regard to the barrenness of the country, as in regard to its insecurity. Few traArelIers see more than the beaten routes, where the hills happen to be unusually stony and barren; but the ex tent of the population AA-hich once inhabited the country furnishes the best evidence of what it is capable of support ing, and its capacities in this respect have been most forcibly dwelt upon by the officers engaged in the survey of the country for the Palestine Exploration Fund, Avho haA'e en joyed unequalled opportunities of judging upon the question. The fact that the resident JeAvish agricultural population of Galilee alone amounts to over a thousand souls, is probably one which will astonish Western JeAvs more than any one else; but I have verified it by actually visiting myself the localities in which they are engaged in their farming opera tions, and am not giving the number Avithout ha\\ring arrived at it upon sure data. There are three prejudices which have operated against the colonization of Palestine by JeAA-s, and which are all ab solutely unsound, and these are, first, that the Jew cannot be come an agriculturist; secondly, that the country is barren, and, thirdly, that it is unsafe. The real obstacle in the way to Palestine colonization does not lie in any of these direc tions, but in the fact that the government is most deter minedly opposed to it."], [77, "THE FIRST PALESTINE RAILWAY. Haifa, June 13. \u2014 When Thackeray foretold that the day Avould come when the scream of the locomotive would aAvake the echoes in the Holy Land, and the voice of the conduct or be heard shouting, \"Ease her, stop her! Any passen gers for Joppa?\" he probably did so very much in the spirit in which Macaulay prophesied the New-Zealander sitting on the ruins of London Bridge, as an event in the dim future, and as a part of some distant impending social revolution; but the realization of the prediction is becoming imminent. The preliminary survey has just been completed as far as the Jordan, of the Hamidie, or Acre and Damascus Railway, which bids fair to be the first Palestine railway. It is called the Hamidie line because it is named after his present majesty the Sultan Abdul Hamid, and probably one reason why the firman has been granted so easily lies in the fact that it passes through a great extent of property which he has recently acquired to the east of the plain of Esdrae lon. The concession is held by ten or tAvelve gentlemen, some of Avhom are Moslems and some Christians, but all are Ottoman subjects resident in Syria. Among the most in fluential are the Messrs. Sursock, bankers, who own the greater part of the plain of Esdraelon, and who have there fore a large interest in the success of the line. From which it will appear that this is no speculation of Western promot ers or financiers, but a real, bona-fide enterprise, and one which is likely to become a large source of profit to the holders of the concession and to the shareholders, for it will tap one of the richest grain-producing districts in the East. I have myself ridden over the line for the first tAventy miles, and have just seen the surveying party, who have re turned Avell satisfied with the facilities which it offers from an engineering point of view. Starting from Acre, it will"], [78, "64 HAIFA folloAv the curve of the bay for ten miles in a southerly di rection at a distance of about two miles from the beach. Crossing the Kishon by a sixty-foot bridge, it will turn east at the junction of a short branch line, two miles long, at Haifa. Hugging the foot of the Carmel range, so as to avoid the Kishon marshes, it Avill pass through the gorge Avhich separates that mountain from the lower ranges of the Galileo hills, and debouch into the plain of Esdraelon. This plain it will traverse in its entire length. The station for Nazareth will be distant about twelve miles from that town ; there may, hoAvever, be a short branch to the foot of the hills. So far there has only been a rise from the sea-level in twenty miles of two hundred and ten feet, so that the grade is imperceptible. It noAV crosses the Avatershed, and com mences to descend across the plain of Jezreel to the valley of the Jordan. Here the Wady Jalud offers an easy incline as far as Beisan, the ancient Bethshean, and every mile of the country it has traversed so far is private property, and fairly cultivated. At Beisan it enters upon a region which has, partly owing to malaria and partly to its insecurity, been abandoned to the Arabs, but it is the tract of all oth ers AA-hich the passage of a railway is likely to transfigure, for the abundance of the Avater, which is now allowed to stagnate in marshes, and which causes its unhealthiness, is destined to attract attention to its great fertility and natural advantages, Avhich would, Avith proper drainage, render it the most profitable region in Palestine. Owing to the ele vation of the springs, which send their copious streams across the site of Beisan, the rich plain which descends to the Jordan, five hundred feet beloAv, can be abundantly ir rigated. \" In fact,\" says Dr. Thomson, describing this place in his \" Land and the Book,\" \" few spots on earth, and none in this country, possess greater agricultural and manu facturing advantages than this valley, and yet it is utterly desolate.\" It needs only a more satisfactory administration on the part of the government, and the connection of this district Avith the sea by rail, to make Beisan an important commer cial and manufacturing centre. All kinds of machinery"], [79, "THE FIRST PALESTINE RAILWA Y. 65 might be driven at small expense by its abounding brooks, and then the lovely valley of Jezreel above it, irrigated by the Jalud, and the Ghor Beisan beloAV, Avatered in every part by many fertilizing streams, are capable of sustaining a little nation in and of themselves. There is a little bit of engineering required to carry the line down to the valley of the Jordan, here eight hundred feet beloAV the level of the sea, Avhich it then follows north as far as the Djisr el- Medjamieh. Near this ancient Roman bridge of three arch es, which is used to this day by the caravans of camels Avhich bring the produce of the Hauran to the coast, the neAV railway bridge will cross the Jordan, probably the only one in the Avorld which will have for its neighbour an actual bridge in use which was built by the Romans, thus, in this noAV semi-barbarous country, bringing into close contact an ancient and a modern civilization. After crossing the Jor dan, the line will still follow the banks of that river to its junction Avith the Yarmuk, which it Avill also cross, and then traverse a fertile plain of rich alluvium, about five miles long by four wide, to the base of the ridge which overlooks the eastern margin of the Sea of Tiberias. This is the extent to Avhich the survey has been complet ed. It is not decided Avhether to rise from the valley by the shoulder of the ridge Avhich overlooks the Yarmuk, or to follow the east shore of the Lake of Tiberias to the Wady Semakh, which offers great advantages for a grade by which to ascend nearly three thousand feet in about fifteen miles. This is the toughest bit of engineering on the line, and is in close proximity to the steep place down Avhich the SAvine possessed by devils are said to have rushed into the sea. Once on the jilateau it Avill traverse the magnificent pasture-lands of Jaulan, across which I rode four years ago in the spring, when the numerous streams by which it Avas watered Avere floAving copiously, and the tall, waving grass reached nearly up to my horse's belly. This rich tract Avas the one on which it is probable that Job pastured his flocks and herds \u2014 at least, all the local tra dition points to this. It was well populated until compara tively recent times, but the sedentary inhabitants, the ruins of whose villages dot the country, were driven out by the 5"], [80, "HAIFA 66 Arabs, Avho now pasture vast herds of cattle upon it, and droves of horses which are fattened here after their journey from Mesopotamia previous to being exported to Egypt. The course of the line across this region has not been defi nitely fixed, but it will probably take as southern a direction as possible, so as to tap the grain-growing country of the Hauran. There may possibly be a short branch to Mezrib, which is the principal grain emporium, and one of the most important halting-places on the great pilgrimage road from Damascus to Mecca. It is calculated that the transport of grain alone from this region to the coast will suffice to pay a large dividend upon the capital required for the construc tion of the road, Avhich will be about one hundred and thirty miles in length. I do not remember the number of tons an nually conveyed on the backs of camels to Acre and Haifa, but I haATe seen thousands of these ungainly animals collect ed at the gates of both those towns during the season, and the amount must be something enormous. This does not include the Avhole of the Damascus trade, Avhich now finds its way by the French carriage road across the Lebanon to Beyrout, and which will all be diverted to the railway, or the produce of the rich country it traverses between the sea coast and the Jordan. The grantees have also secured the right to put steam-tugs upon the Lake of Tiberias, and under the influence of this new means of transportation the desolate shores will under go transformation. The great plain of Genesareth, across which I rode a month ago, is now a Avaste of the most luxu riant wild vegetation, Avatered by three fine streams, besides being Avell supplied with springs. It Avas celebrated of old for the amount and variety of its produce, and I haA'e no doubt is again destined to be so. The plains in which Beth saida and Capernaum stood formerly are all covered with heavy vegetation which conceals the extensive ruins of the cities which once adorned them; and there is a fine back country within easy reach of the lake Avhich will send its produce to it as soon as means of transportation are pro vided. At present there are only half a dozen sailing-boats on the lake, rather a contrast from the time when Josephus collected no fewer than two hundred and thirty war-ships"], [81, "THE FIRST PALESTINE RAILWAY. 67 with AA'hich to attack Tiberius in the Avar against the Ro mans; and the fish Avith which it abounded in the days of the miraculous draught are more miraculously numerous than ever, for fishing as an industry has almost ceased to exist, and the finny tribe are left undisturbed. There are some celebrated sulphur baths also on the shores of the lake and Avithin tAvo miles of the town, which are visited annually by thousands of patients. I was there during the bathing sea son, and found them camped in tents on the margin of the lake, or SAveltering in the fetid atmosphere of the one large bathing-room, in Avhich a crowd of naked and more or less cutaneous patients were disporting themselA-es. The surveying party tell me that they received the great est kindness and hospitality from the Arabs in the Jordan valley, Avho were of a sedentary tribe, and cultivated the land, and AA'ho looked forward with pleasure to the advent of a railway, and to the chances of employment which it af forded them. Indeed, both natives and foreigners are not a little excited at the prospect which is now being opened to them, and Avhich promises to be the dawn of a new era of prosperity for the country. Note. \u2014 Since the above was written, the concession has lapsed in conse quence of difficulties which arose at the last moment in the formation of the company for carrying out the enterprise; but it is again in process of re newal, and I have little doubt but that it will be ultimately accomplished."], [82, "SAFED. Haifa, July 10. \u2014 Next to Jerusalem, the city most high ly venerated by the JeAvs in Palestine is Safed. I had oc casion to visit it a few Aveeks ago on my way to a colony of Russian and Roumanian Jews Avhich has been established in the neighbourhood. Perched on the summit of a moun tain nearly three thousand feet high, it is one of the most picturesquely situated towns in the country; and there is a tradition to the effect that it was alluded to by Christ as \"the city that is set on a hill, and cannot be hid,\" Avhen he preached the Sermon on the Mount, the mount being sup posed to be one of the Horns of Hattin, a remarkably shaped hill. The whole of this district is indeed full of romantic scenery. It is a country of Avild gorges and huge preci pices, Avhich escape the attention of the traveller following the beaten routes, and to most of them associations are at tached, investing them with an interest beyond that of a mere scenic character. There is, for instance, the Wady Hammam, where the bluffs are about twelve hundred feet high, perforated with caves, communicating with each other by passages concealed in the rock, once the abode of bands of robbers Avho lived like eagles in their eyries. Looking up at these holes in the cliff some seven or eight hundred feet above me, I tried to picture the terrible battle which was once fought in mid-air betAveen the denizens of these caves and the soldiers Avhom Herod let doAvn the face of the cliff in baskets to attack them. The desperate nature of the struggle, as the soldiers strove to make good their foothold on the edge of the caves, and the frenzy with which the rob bers, who had no loophole of escape, must have defended themselves as they endeavoured to hurl their assailants from their baskets, suggested a scene which Avas quite in keeping"], [83, "SAFED. 69 with the gloomy character of the surroundings. Some of the more accessible of these caves have been occupied at a later period by hermits, and they may have been utilized for military purposes at the time of the crusades, but they have never been thoroughly explored. Just before reaching Safed there is a rock called Akhbera, Avhich rises five hundred feet sheer up from the path, and is also full of similar caves. Josephus mentions having fortified it. However prepossessing Safed may look from a distance, it does not bear a close acquaintance. Down the centre of every street runs an open sewer, Avhich renders it the most odoriferous and pestiferous place that it has ever been my fate to sleep in. The aspect of the population is in keeping with the general smell. One seems transported into the ghetto of some Roumanian or Russian town, with a few Eastern disagreeables added. The population here have not adopted the Oriental costume as they have at Tiberias, but wear the high hats, greasy gabardines, and ear-curls of the JeAvs of Europe. Instead of Arabic, one hears nothing in the streets but \" jargon,\" as the dialect used by the Jews in eastern Europe is called. The total population of Ashkena zim, or German JeAvs, Avho are hived in this unenviable lo cality, is betAveen five and six thousand; besides these there are about twelve hundred Sephardim, or Spanish JeAV6, who wear Oriental costumes, and in the other quarter of the town from six to seven thousand Moslems, making the total num ber of inhabitants about fourteen thousand. As there is nothing approaching to a hotel or boarding house in the place, I Avas of course dependent on the na tive hospitality for board and lodging, and thus able to ac quire an insight into the mode of life of rather a curious section of the human family. The majority of the JeAvs here are supported by a charitable fund called the Haluka, which is subscribed to by pious JeAvs all over the Avorld as a sacred duty, for the purpose of providing support to those of their coreligionists Avho come here or to Jerusalem to pass the last years of their lives in devotional exercises, and to die on the sacred soil. The practical result of this sys tem is to maintain in idleness and mendicancy a set of use less bigots, who combine superstitious observance with im-"], [84, "70 HAIFA moral practice, and who, as a rule, are opposed to every project which has for its object the real progress of the Jewish nation. Hence they regard with alarm the establish ment-of agricultural colonies, or the inauguration of an era of any kind of labour by JeAvs in Palestine. They are bit terly hostile to schools in which any secular teaching is car ried on, and agree Avith those Western JeAvs Avho consider that any scheme for developing the material resources of Palestine by means of Jewish industry is fantastic and visionary. It is due to the Jewish population of Safed to say that this spirit does not prevail among the younger members of it. There are about a hundred young Safed Jews Avho actually work as day-labourers on the farms of Moslems and Christians, and I Avas informed by one of the most liberal of the rabbis, the only one, in fact, Avho was in clined to promote JeAvish agriculture, that about two hun dred families in Safed Avere desirous of being established on farms, while several had OAvned land and cultivated it, and only abandoned it at last for want of protection against the extortionate demands of Turkish tax-gatherers. It is true that most of the Jews at Safed are under the protection of some European poAver, but until lately no power has taken sufficient interest in the race to raise a Jewish question with the Turkish government. Noav that important political in terests are to be subserved by doing so, and the destiny of Palestine is likely to become a crucial point in the Eastern question, both Russia and France are seizing every excuse for interference and complaint, and the questions which are constantly arising in regard to their Jewish proteges, both in Tiberias and Safed, are likely to furnish them with the pre texts they desire. When I was in Safed, Russia Avas actively espousing the cause of a young Jew who had accidentally shot a Moslem, and over Avhom the Turkish goA-ernment claimed jurisdic tion, on the ground that, though a Russian, he had repudi ated his allegiance to Russia. As the youth Avas not of age at the time, the Russian government still claimed the right to protect him in Turkey, though it had not exercised this right in Russia itself, from Avhich country he had been com pelled to flee for his life. As I rode through the village"], [85, "SAFED. 71 where the accident had taken place, in company with some Jews, we were pelted by the Moslem population, and, al though the release of the boy is now certain, he will proba bly be compelled to leave the country, unless the relatives of the deceased Moslem can be pacified with the blood-money that has been offered them. Jauna, which was the name of the village to which I was bound, was situated about three miles from Safed, in a gorge, from which, as we descended it, a magnificent view was ob tained over the Jordan valley, with the Lake of Tiberias lying three thousand feet below us on the right, and the waters of Merom, or the Lake of Huleh, on the left. The intervening plain was a rich expanse of country, only wait ing development. The new colony had been established about eight months, the land having been purchased from the Moslem villagers, of whom twenty families remained, who lived on terms of perfect amity with the Jews. These consisted of twenty -three Roumanian and four Russian families, numbering in all one hundred and forty souls. The greater number were hard at work on their potato-patches when I arrived, and I was pleased to find evidences of thrift and industry. A row of sixteen neat little houses had been built, and more were in process of erection. Altogether this is the most hopeful attempt at a colony which I have seen in Palestine. The colonists own about a thousand acres of excellent land, which they were able to purchase at from three to four dollars an acre. The Russians are establishing themselves about half a mile from the Roumanians, as Jews of different nationalities easily get on well together. They call the colony Rosch Pina, or \" Head of the Corner,\" the word occurring in the verse, \" The stone which the build ers rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.\""], [86, "MEIRON. Haifa, July 20. \u2014 One of the most interesting and little known spots in Palestine is the famous shrine of Jewish pil grimage called Meiron. Hither, in the latter part of the month of May, Hebrews resort in vast numbers from all parts, especially of the East, and as many as two thousand are often encamped there at a time. It is situated in a wild part of the mountains of central Galilee, on the edge of the most fertile plateau in the whole district, where the villages are surrounded by the most luxuriant gardens and groves, and the peasantry are in a more prosperous condition than I have seen elsewhere. Meiron itself is a wonderfully romantic spot; perched at an elevation of twenty five hun dred feet above the sea, upon the northeastern flank of a high spur of the Jebel Jermuk range, it commands a mag nificent view of the surrounding country, with the town of Safed, towering on its mountain-top, distant about five miles. A clear, brawling stream tumbles in a series of small cas cades down the narrow gorge, which expands just here suf ficiently to allow of some orchards of apricots, figs, and pomegranates ; and near a spreading weeping-willow there is a picturesque old flour-mill, which turns to advantage so unusual a supply of water-power. A hundred yards or so above it is the spot sacred to Jewish devotees. A large, ob long courtyard, around which runs a broad stone balcony, upon which open chambers crowned with domgs, marks the site of the burial-places of some of the most celebrated rab bis of Jewish history, and forms a sort of caravansary for the pilgrims. It was not the moment of the pilgrimage at the time of my visit, and I had a choice of chambers. Two of these had been fitted up most comfortably for my bene fit, with beds and tables, by the Safed Jews who accom panied me, and who did the honours of the place. It was"], [87, "MEIRON. 73 no doubt the sacredness of the tombs at Meiron which was the cause of Safed being constituted a Jewish colony and a holy city. Here are situated the tombs of the Rabbi Jochanau Sandelar, of the celebrated Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, the reputed author of the book of the Sohar, and the Father of the Cabalists. Here repose the remains of his son, the Rabbi Eleazer ; but more celebrated than all are the sepulchres of the great saints and doctors, Shammai and Hillel. The thirty-six pupils of the latter were buried with him. He founded a school of morals immediately prior to the birth of Christ ; and, indeed, it is main tained by Jews that all the ethics of Christianity are to be found in the teaching of Hillel, to which Christ simply gave a more forcible expression than it had 'hitherto re ceived. Of all the tombs that of Hillel is the most remarkable. It is a huge cavern on the steep hillside, situated about half-way between the Courtyard of Shrines above, and the stream be low. We first enter a chamber with loculi hewn out of the solid rock on each side. Passing through a doorway cut in the rock, we enter a chamber eighteen feet by twenty-five, with seven loculi in recess on the right, and the same number on the left, while facing us is a recess eighteen feet deep and seven wide, containing four sarcophagi hewn out of the rock. On each side of this recess is a smaller one, each containing four loculi. Most of them are covered by stone lids with raised corners, making in all thirty -six rock tombs in this one cave. The rocks all around are much cut in places into steps, cisterns, and olive-presses. There are also three dol mens on the north side of Meiron; they are not far apart, and are quite distinct, though of small dimensions; there are no traces or marks of any kind on the stones. In the shrine above these are chambers which are pointed out as tradition al tombs. Near one of these was the synagogue, in which, when I visited it, there were an old man and his son engaged in their devotions. The old man had never left the room day or night for seven years, having lived the whole of that time on one meal a day of bread and water, while he slept on a mat on the stones. He had thus become invested with the odour of sanctity in the eyes of my Jewish companions."], [88, "74 HAIFA His son, a boy of fifteen, was rapidly praying himself into the state of imbecility at which his venerable parent, by dint of swaying his body to and fro, and his unceasing chanting, had already arrived. He reminded me of the Buddhist her mits whom I have seen in China on their way to Nirvana, and was a sight more painful than edifying. At the corners of the courtyard are stone erections like fonts, and some of these are also near the rock tombs; these, when the Jewish festival of \"the burning\" takes place, are filled with oil, which is set on fire, and rich Jews, desirous of showing their devotion, offer to the flames the most costly articles in their possession. The richest shawls, scarfs, handkerchiefs, and the rarest books are dipped in oil and consumed, and when any article of special value is burned, the spectators, who are already intoxicated with wine and excitement, burst forth with frantic plaudits of delight. Such was the account given to me by eye-witnesses, but possibly next year I may be able to give you a description of this unique and little-known fes tival from personal observation. About fifty yards higher up the hill is one of the most interesting Jewish ruins existing in Palestine. It is the re mains of a synagogue, which, according to Jewish tradition, dates from fifty years after the destruction of Jerusalem. It was about this time, or a little later, that the Jews pre sented the extraordinary spectacle of two regular and or ganized communities, one under a sort of spiritual head, the Patriarch of Tiberias, comprehending all of Israelitish de scent who inhabited the Roman Empire ; the other under the Prince of the Captivity, to whom all the Eastern Jews paid their allegiance. The Romans recognized the Patriarch ship of Tiberias, granted it special privileges, and the Jew ish colony round Tiberias under its auspices became very powerful. Schools of Talmudic learning were established, and the most celebrated rabbis wrote, and, in fact, stamped with their learning the Judaism which has felt their influence to the present day. Then it was that Meiron became their place of burial, and that the largest and most ancient syna gogue of which we have any traces was built at Meiron. The site of the synagogue was chosen on the eastern side of a rocky mound, and the western side and floor were excavated"], [89, "MEIRON. 75 out of the solid rock. The whole of the area is ninety feet by fifty. Pieces of columns are lying about, with pedestals and capitals, but many of the finest fragments have rolled down the eastern slope. The edifice fronted the south, and here the fagade remains, with a fine portal of large hewn blocks of stone, and a side door. Some of the stones are four and a half feet long by two and a half thick. The portal is ten and a half feet high by five and a half wide. Its side-posts are each of a single stone elaborately sculptured. The sculptured lintel projects somewhat above the side-posts, but I could see nothing of the Hebrew in scription which some of the old writers mention as being over the door. The centre stone was shaken out of its place by the earthquake of 1 837. Altogether, the situation and gen eral aspect of this singular ruin, projecting as it does out of the overhanging solid rock, is full of picturesque as well as of historical interest. Meiron is probably mentioned by Josephus as Meroth, a place fortified by him in Upper Gali lee. Dr. Thomson identifies it with the Meroz, so bitterly cursed by Deborah because the inhabitants would not join the expedition of Barak. And, in confirmation of this, there is a fountain near Meiron called to this day by the Jews Deborah's fountain, but the Sephardim rabbi, who was my guide, philosopher, and friend at Meiron, identified it with Shimrom-Meron, whose king was one of the thirty-one mentioned in the Book of Joshua as having been smitten by him on entering Canaan. A great part of the village belonged to the rabbi, and, with a view of encouraging agriculture among his core ligionists, he had put six Jewish families from Morocco on the land, who were accustomed to farming, and were doing well. Besides these there were twelve Moslem families, which completed the population of the village. I was much struck by the good-feeling which existed between them and the Jews, the sheik whom I visited speaking in the highest terms of the latter, as being hard-working and excellent ag riculturists. Indeed, in walking over the village lands, those which were cultivated by Jewish labour compared fa vourably with the crops of the Fellahin. Altogether, I was 60 much attracted by Meiron and its neighbourhood, which"], [90, "76 HAIFA. is full of interesting remains that have not yet been thorough ly examined, from an antiquarian point of view, that I pro pose paying it another visit. Behind Meiron rises Jebel Jermuk, the highest mountain in western Palestine. I scrambled up it one day, finding my self as I did so in the midst of the wildest scenery to the west of the Jordan. Here villages were few and far be tween. Nothing was to be seen but rocky gorges and wild hillsides, trackless, excepting where the goats follow each other in search of herbage, but with a grand and sav age beauty which it is difficult to reconcile with the idea that they ever supported a large population. Probably, even in the most flourishing days of Palestine, these high lands were always its wildest parts, and there are compara tively few ancient sites or traces of ruins in the remote re cesses of these mountains. Jebel Jermuk rears its rounded summit to a height of four thousand feet above the sea-level, and about three hundred feet below the top are the ruins of a village which was abandoned about twenty years ago by twelve Jewish families, which formed its entire population, and who were all cultivators of the soil and owners of flocks and herds. In those days it was the highest inhabited spot in Palestine, and it is wonderful to think its pure mountain air should not have protected the inhabitants against cholera, which was then decimating the country. So far from such being the case, nearly the whole male population was car ried off, and the village was abandoned, and finally be came the property of a Druse village about three miles dis tant. The stone walls of the houses are still standing and there is a well of delicious water, shaded by trees, making the spot altogether a desirable retreat from the summer heats and a healthy locality for a colony, if it were not so inacces sible. These mountains are not frequented by Bedouin Arabs, and need nothing but roads and cultivation to make many now barren spots fertile and profitable. The more one travels over the less-frequented parts of the country, the more one is struck with the extent of its undeveloped re sources and with the possible future which is in store for it."], [91, "THE FEAST OF ST. ELIAS. Haifa, July 31. \u2014 The greatest religious festival of the year in these parts takes place on the 20th of July at the Monastery of Mount Carmel, and is called the Feast of St. Elias. It does not rank in the Roman Catholic Church generally as one of the highest importance, but among the Maronites, Melchites, and the Latin Oriental Church, as well as among the Carmelites themselves, it is par excellence the great annual ecclesiastical event. From all parts of Pal estine worshippers of all ranks flock to the sacred grotto, and on the evening before the saint's day as many as five or six thousand souls are often assembled on the rugged prom ontory and in the enclosures surrounding the monastery. Hither I repaired about six o'clock on the evening of the 19th, and sipped coffee, smoked cigarettes, and chatted with the reverend fathers, while I looked out of the iron-barred windows on the multitude assembling beneath them. It was composed for the most part of venders of fruit, sweet meats, and refreshments of all sorts, who were establishing their stalls for the night in sheltered nooks, for the feast begins at midnight, and is carried on till nine o'clock next day, being, in fact, a species of religious orgy, which ap pears to have great fascination for the native Christian mind. It must be admitted that devotions which consist chiefly in dancing and drinking, with an occasional free fight, all through the small hours of the morning, are re ligious exercises of a kind not unlikely to attract the coun try people, who go in for a sort of holy spree on a scale of large proportions. This year, however, a general panic which pervaded the country in consequence of the cholera in Egypt reduced the numbers materially, especially of the Fellahin, among whom all kinds of absurd rumours were prevalent that the disease had spread to Haifa, and that the"], [92, "78 HAIFA monastery itself was in quarantine. After watching the picturesque arrivals for some time, I declined an invitation to spend the night in the monastery, and determined to re turn next morning at five o'clock, when I was assured that the fun would be fast and furious. As I approached at that hour my expectations were ex cited by the reports of the discharge of pistols and guns, and the sounds of the discordant chorus-chanting which forms the usual accompaniment to the native dances. Pass ing under the archway and entering the large courtyard of the monastery, I found it nearly full of excited groups in large circles, their arms clasped around each other's necks, swaying their bodies to and fro, and keeping time with their feet to their songs, while they occasionally waved their arms aloft and fired in the air. This is the regular Syrian dance of the towns, and it is sufficiently monotonous. The Fellahin, however, have a far more picturesque perform ance, in which the girls, in bright-coloured garments, join, dancing singly, or in twos and threes. Of these, unfortu nately, there were very few. No doubt it was in consequence of the small attendance that there had not been so much drinking as usual, and I only saw one man captured by half a dozen Turkish soldiers, who must have a curious idea of Christian devotions, for an improper use of his fist. About this time the guest-chambers and corridors of the monastery \u2014 where families of the better class who had come from Acre, Tyre, Nazareth, Jaffa, and other towns had passed the night, in the lodging provided for them \u2014 began to disgorge, and the variety of costume displayed by the shouting, singing, and dancing multitude formed a scene sufficiently picturesque and animated. Sometimes proces sions are formed, where offerings are made to the miracle working statue of Notre Dame de Mont Carmel, in return for a child that has been prayed for, or a sick person who has been healed, but on this occasion her protection did not seem to have been invoked, or, at all events, there was no public display of gratitude. There is a large terrace in front of the monastery, and here a dozen horsemen or so were throwing the djerrid and exhibiting their equestrian skill, much to the detriment of the unfortunate animals they"], [93, "THE FEAST OF ST. ELIAS. 79 bestrode, whose flanks were bleeding profusely from the pointed angles of the iron stirrups which serve as spurs, and from the cruel bits by which, when going at full speed, they were jerked back upon their haunches. While all this was going on outside, mass was being per formed in the church for those who wished to vary the enter tainment. This is a spacious, vaulted building in the form of a Greek cross, with a fine-toned organ in one transept, and a statue of the miraculous Lady of Mount Carmel, between four Corinthian columns, seated on a sort of throne in a richly decorated dress of white satin, in the other. Both the Vir gin and the Infant in her arms had golden crowns on their beads, the result of a miracle, for when the Frere Jean Bap tiste undertook the reconstruction of the monastery fifty years ago, he intrusted the carving of the statue to Caraven ta, a sculptor of Genoa, and, not having money enough to buy her a crown suitable to her position, procured her one of silver, and one of copper gilt for the Child, saying as he did so, \" You will know how to procure yourself a better one;\" and this she achieved shortly after at Naples, where a rich nobleman presented her with two in return for a mi raculous cure of which he was the subject. There is a book sold in the monastery containing a list of the miracles that have been performed by this statue, which was gazed upon with the greatest awe and veneration by the country people. They prostrate themselves before her, touching the ground with their foreheads, and offering up their supplications after a fashion that would shock an enlightened Buddhist by the superstition and credulity thus suggested. On each side of the figure are two altars, one dedicated to St. Jean Baptiste, and the other to St. Simon Stock, an English man, who was made Prior-General of the Order of Carmel ites in 1245, and who in his day did more than any other to increase their renown. On the right of this is the statue of Elijah slaying a prophet of Baal, which was sculptured at Barcelona by Dom Amedeo. The prophet has got his false rival on the ground between his feet, and, with uplifted sword, is in the act of cutting his head off. He is hung round with votive offerings, and worshippers crowd around to touch some part of the statue, and then kiss the finger"], [94, "80 HAIFA, that has touched it. On a table in front a monk was selling engravings to the worshippers. I bought one of these, rep resenting Elijah sending Elisha to look for the sign of rain. In the distance is the small cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, and emerging from it is the figure of the Virgin and Child, for the Roman Catholic tradition has it that in this cloud was revealed to the prophet the dogma of the immac ulate conception, in which he was a firm believer from that time forward. Descending a few rock-cut steps close to this image, we find ourselves in the cave of Elijah, a small grotto about ten feet by fifteen, at one end of which is an altar, which the devotees firmly believe is the actual rock that he used as his bed. Here a priest was performing mass. The body of the church was full of devotees, for the most part women in white burnooses, who squatted on the ground, and seemed principally engaged in suckling their babies. The monastery derives a considerable revenue from these celebrations, as in good seasons votive offerings to a large value are brought; but the chief source of its wealth is de rived from the sale of indulgences, or at least what virtually amounts to this. By these means it exercises a very powerful moral as well as financial influence all through the country, and as the Christian population, which is subject to it, is very large in proportion to the Moslem in the neighbourhood, and as it is under the exclusive protectorate of France, this influ ence partakes also of a very distinct political character. In fact, the Christians of the whole of this district enjoy a far more efficient protection against the oppression of the Turk ish government than do the Moslems themselves. The monastery is a modern building, and if it only had a tall chimney instead of a cupola it would look more like a manufactory than a religious edifice. The top of the cupola is five hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea, which is immediately beneath, and commands a magnificent view. When Napoleon besieged Acre in 1799, and was compelled to raise the siege and retreat, the Turks fell upon the wounded French soldiers who were left in hospital here and massa cred them to a man. The convent was, of course, deserted, and soon after fell into ruin. For twenty-seven years this"], [95, "THE FEAST OF ST. ELIAS. 81 much venerated spot was abandoned, but the order to which it had given its name never ceased to agitate for the restora tion of its sanctuary, and the work of reconstruction was finally undertaken in 1826, by Jean Baptiste, and completed in 1853. So the present building is only thirty years old. In front of the main terrace is a flower - garden and some trellised vines, in the centre of which is a pyramid sur mounted by a cross, with an inscription to the effect that it commemorates the resting-place of the bones of the French soldiers. It was not till five years after their massacre that Father Jules du St. Sauvcur ventured back to the moun tain, where he found these melancholy traces of the tragedy scattered among the ruins, and, collecting them, hid them in a cave until, under more auspicious circumstances, they could receive a Christian burial. There can be no doubt that the order is now increasing in wealth and influence, and expectation runs high that the day is not far distant when northern Palestine will become a French province, and when its prosperity will be still further secured. 0"], [96, "A SUMMER CAMP ON CARMEL. Esfia, Aug. 20. \u2014 The fact that the cholera was raging in Egypt, that in the ordinary course of events it was certain to visit Syria, that even if it did not, the months of July, August, and September are disagreeably hot at Haifa, de termined me to make the experiment of camping out on the highest point of Carmel, and I am at this moment sitting under a Bedouin tent, arranged after a fashion of my own, at an altitude of eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, upon which I look down in two opposite directions. On the northwest, distant six miles, curves the Bay of Acre, with the town itself glistening white in the distance ; and on the southwest, distant seven miles, the Mediterranean breaks upon the beach that bounds the plain of Sharon, and with a good glass I can make out the outlines of the ruins of the old port of C\u0153sarea. Southward are the confused hills known as the mountains of Samaria; beyond them, in the blue haze, I can indistinctly see the highlands of Gilead; while nearer still, Mount Gilboa, Mount Tabor, the Naza reth range, with a house or two of that town visible, and Mount Hermon, rising behind the high ranges of northern Galilee, are all comprised in a prospect unrivalled in its pan oramic extent and in the interest attached to the localities upon which the eye rests in every direction. I was some time picking out just the spot on which to camp, so many advantageous sites suggested themselves, but the paramount necessity of being near a village for security and supplies, and, above all, near a good spring, decided me in favour of my present location; and as the conditions under which I have brought a large party up to the top of this somewhat inaccessible mountain and planted them upon it are novel, I venture to think that an account of our experience may prove interesting."], [97, "A SUMMER CAMP ON 'CARMEL. 83 In the first place, the village itself was out of the ques tion, partly because Arab houses, as a rule, do not consist of more than one room, and even when one has turned out their human inhabitants, it still remains tenanted by so many others of a carnivorous character, though minute in size, that existence becomes a burden; and partly because they are pervaded with a singular odour of burnt manure, which the natives use as fuel for the ovens in which they bake their bread, and which is too pungent to be agreeable to unsophisticated nostrils. After inhaling it for a month I have got rather to like it than otherwise. As I suspected that such might be the case, and believed that a successful war might be waged against the insects, I decided on hiring one of these rooms as a guest-chamber and a place of resort from the midday sun, in case the camp did not prove a suf ficient protection. This room was nothing more nor less than a vault like a cellar, with stone walls and a stone roof, supported by cross arches, about twenty feet by thirty ; and I may here mention that the precaution turned out wise, for we got fairly rid of the fleas, aijd the temperature in the middle of the day, when we usually repair to it for our siesta, has never been over 80\u00b0. But how to make a camp which should accommodate three ladies and four gentlemen was a serious question. Wre had one European tent capable of holding two people, and a smaller one for a bachelor of modest requirements in the way of standing-room, and these we supplemented with a tent which we hired of some neigh bouring Bedouins, which was thirty feet long, but which, when pitched according to their fashion, was an impossible habitation for civilized beings, as it had no walls. Indeed, the whole breadth of the black camel's-hair cloth of which it was composed was only ten feet. We therefore decided on using it merely as a roof, and sent down to Haifa for a camel load of light lumber in order to make a frame on which to stretch it. We also got up two dozen cheap mats, six feet square, at twenty-five cents apiece. With these we made front and back walls and partitions for sleeping cribs. Finally our erection, on which we proudly hoisted the na tional flag, was thirty-four feet long, ten feet wide, seven feet high in front and five feet in rear. These mats can be"], [98, "84 HAIFA. triced up in front and rear in the daytime so as to allow a free circulation of air. On the roof, in order to keep the sun from beating too fiercely upon us, we spread branches of the odorous bay-tree, with which the scrubby woods of the mountain abound, and of these same branches we erected a kitchen, and stable for the horse and three donkeys which composed our establishment. The thermometer usually fell to 70\u00b0 at night, and there were heavy morning dews and fogs. It was no slight task selecting the furniture, bedding, cooking-utensils, and comestibles for a party of seven, and it took eight camels, besides sundry donkeys, to carry all our necessaries. In order to understand the nature of the path over which we had to travel, the reader must get rid of the popular notion conveyed by the word \"Mount,\" which is usually applied to Carmel, that it is a solitary hill. So far from such being the case, it is a mountainous district about fourteen miles long and twelve wide at its base. It culmi nates in a promontory, which projects into the sea at its apex, but we are established ten miles from Haifa, the path ascending abruptly from that town, and following for near ly three hours' travel the backbone of the ridge, disclosing views of wondrous beauty down gorges on the right and left. It is \" a rocky road to travel \" for a delicate lady, involving steep, precipitous ascents, for which sure-footed donkeys are best ; but we were obliged to resort to a chair and a litter, each carried by four bearers, who, as they stum bled and clambered up the narrow path, seemed bent upon capsizing their human burdens. Now, however, that we have safely endured the perils of the way, we are amply re paid for them. The nights and mornings arc of ideal beauty. The ef fects of sunrise and sunset, ever varying, over the vast land scape that stretches around and beneath us, are a constant source of wonder and delight. From the vine-covered ter race on which our camp is situated we look down a wild, rocky, precipitous gorge eighteen hundred feet upon the plain of the Kishon, scarce a mile distant, so steep is it. To the right this gorge widens into an amphitheatre, and the hillsides, sloping more gently, are terraced with vines, figs,"], [99, "A SUMMER CAMP ON CARMEL. 85 and pomegranates, and at its head is the copious spring which supplies us with water, to which one of our donkeys makes several pilgrimages a day with a large earthen jar slung in a straw cradle on each side. Here, morning and evening, files of Druse women resort, and stand and gossip round the cistern into which the water gushes from the rock, their bright-coloured dresses forming a charming con trast with the dark-green foliage of the gardens aud or chards that are irrigated in the immediate vicinity. Be sides about five hundred Druses there are fifty Christians in the village, who do not harmonize with the Druses very well, and there is a hot rivalry for our favour, so that we have to exercise a considerable amount of diplomacy to keep on good terms with all. We have hired the vault from a Christian, and his family next door consists of his stepmother and four half-sisters, strapping, good-looking wenches, who are not yet married, for lack of the necessary dowers. With them is staying a cousin from Acre, one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, quite Caucasian in type and complexion, which is white and transparent as that of any Western beauty. We have great difficulty in keeping this bevy of damsels out of our room, as Arabs have no idea of privacy, and they im agine that politeness consists in squatting round in a circle and asking silly questions. Excepting for the practice it gives one in Arabic, and for a certain insight which one thus gains into the manners and customs of the natives, these visits would be intolerable, and, indeed, we have found it necessary to take stringent measures to limit them. It is more interesting to go and sit in the cool veranda outside of the little Druse place of worship, and talk to the bright young man who is passing most of his time in studying the abstruse metaphysical system of his religion, and who is far more intelligent than the Syrian Catholic priest, who also comes and sits and smokes with us with the view of obtain ing, which he has not yet succeeded in doing, some knowl edge of our own religious belief. Now and then an episode occurs illustrating the conditions of native existence in these parts. One day I found the village excited at an outrage which a native mounted policeman had perpetrated. On"], [100, "86 HAIFA. learning that he had assaulted not merely one of the vil lagers, but my own servant, who had refused him access to our vault, I inflicted a little corporal punishment upon him, when his officer and the village notables interfered, and in terceded in his behalf. I asked the latter why they were not glad to see a man punished who, like the rest of his class, was forever persecuting them; they said that when I was gone he would come back and take his revenge upon them. I finally made the man apologize to the Druse he had assaulted, and to my servant, all which he did very humbly, fearing that unless he did so I should insist upon his receiving a still severer punishment from the Caimacan, or local governor, at Haifa. The villagers were very grate ful to see one of this arrogant and overbearing class hum bled, but they say that unless one can stay and protect them their last state will be worse than their first."], [101, "87 THE DRUSES OF MOUNT CARMEL. In Camp, Mount Carmel, Sept. 10. \u2014 It is not generally known that the Druse nation extends as far south as Car mel. The most southern village occupied by them in Syria is at Dalieh, about two miles from my present camp; their most northern home is at Aleppo. When, nine hundred years ago, Duruzi, the teacher from whom they take their name, came from Egypt to spread his new teaching, it was accepted by a tribe of people who lived in the neighbourhood of Aleppo, whither they had originally migrated from the province of Yemen, in Arabia. Adopting the new and mysterious faith, which, while it is a most interesting metaphysical and theo logical study, is too recondite to enter upon here, the body of the tribe migrated south, took possession of the val leys of the southern Lebanon, and made their headquar ters at the foot of Mount Hermon. Spreading east from there, they crossed the tract known in ancient times as Iturea, and found a natural fortress in the volcanic re gion anciently called Trachonitis, the Biblical Argob, and in the mountains now called the Jebel Druse. Here they increased and multiplied, and in the early part of the seven teenth century produced that most remarkable warrior Fakr-Eddin, the only man of note of whom the Druses can boast. He conquered Beyrout and the southern coast towns, extending his sway as far south as Carmel, and as far east as Tiberias; and under his auspices the mountains of Galilee and Carmel became settled by Druses. It is, therefore, not much more than two hundred and fifty years since the Druses first came to Carmel, and it is probable that when they did so they found the mountain wholly unoccupied, excepting by a few Christian hermits and devotees who lived in its caves \u2014 for the Carmelite monks had been driven away and their monastery destroyed"], [102, "88 HAIFA three hundred years before; and, indeed, it was only at the time of the Druse occupation that the first attempt was made to restore it. For the two centuries during which the crusaders held the Holy Land prior to the end of the thirteenth century, Carmel was occupied by them, and the remains of their military posts are still to be found on many of the summits of the mountain ; indeed, many of the old stones of which the village of Esfia is built, near which my camp is situated, bear their devices carved on them. Before the time of the crusaders there may have been Moslem villages on Carmel, but its glory departed when Palestine was conquered by the Saracens in the seventh century, and the last remains of Roman civilization, the traces of which still cover the mountain, were de stroyed. About the time of Christ, and for four or five centuries afterwards, it must have been in its full loveliness, its hill sides terraced with vineyards or clothed with magnificent forests, and its summits crowned with towns adorned with the grace and beauty of the architecture of the period. The discoveries I have made in proof of this I will post pone to another letter, as my intention now is to describe the present population by which the mountain is inhabited. It is a curious fact that to this day there are no Moslems on Carmel proper. There are five or six Moslem villages at its base, on the various sides of the triangle which com prises the district, and they have lands running up into the mountain; but the actual population consists of two Druse villages, numbering together about eight hundred souls, and about fifty Christians, besides the twenty-five monks who inhabit the monastery. The mountain is nevertheless capa ble of containing a population of many thousands, as it evi dently did in old times, and is a much larger district than is popularly supposed. The eastern side, from the apex of the triangle, is thirteen miles in length, the western twelve, and the base nine, giv ing a total circumference to this highland region of thirty four miles. The tract comprised in this area is beautifully diversified by wild gorges, grassy valleys, level or undulat ing plateaus covered with underwood, and rocky summits;"], [103, "THE DRUSES OF MOUNT CARMEL. 89 and the scenery in places is as romantic as can well be imagined. The two Druse villages of Esfia and Dalieh are situated two miles apart, about three quarters of the way down the triangle from its apex (the projecting promontory on which the monastery is built), and occupy the most fer tile part of the mountain. When the Druses first settled here they founded no fewer than eight villages, but when, forty years ago, this country was conquered by Egypt and governed by Ibrahim Pacha, his rule was distasteful to the majority of Druses, and the inhabitants of six villages abandoned them, and migrated to the Jebel Druse. All these villages occupied the sites of ancient Roman towns, and were constructed of the ancient stones. In the course of my rambles I have visited them all. Of the two villages which remained, one, Dalieh, was occupied by some families which had migrated direct from Aleppo; the other, Esfia, is peopled by Druses from the Lebanon. There is a marked difference between the two, and the people of Dalieh are far superior to those of Esfia. I went over there the other day, and spent the day and night as the guest of the sheik \u2014 or, I should rather say, of the sheiks, for there are two \u2014 one is the temporal and the other the spiritual head of the village \u2014 and I divided my attentions and my meals equally between them. They are very reluctant to talk about their religion, always turning the subject when any attempt is made to induce them to converse about it; but there is one question which they al ways ask, and that is whether there are any Druses in Eng land. As it is an accepted fact among them that there are, any denial of it is considered a discreet reticence, and rath er a proof than otherwise that one is somewhat of a Druse one's self. They also believe that the majority of China men are, unconsciously to themselves, Druses; and they are firmly convinced that the world is drawing to a close, and that the appearance of Hakim, a divine incarnation, which was prophesied to take place nine hundred years after his last manifestation and translation, is now imminent, as the time is just about expiring. The Druses are a sober, fairly honest, and industrious peo-"], [104, "HAIFA 90 pie, and have their own notions of morality, to which they rigidly adhere. They have only one wife, but they have great facilities of divorce. An amusing illustration of this came under my immediate notice while I was the sheik's guest. His son, a fine young man, had been my guide among some neighbouring ruins the day before. I had also made the acquaintance of the wife of the latter, a remark ably pretty woman, with a baby. Indeed, I was much struck with the beauty of the type of all the Dalieh women. Suddenly a tremendous uproar took place in the village. My host rushed out to restore order. While I looked down on the scene from an upper window, I saw his son, bareheaded, brandishing a huge stone in the air, and vehe mently gesticulating, apparently in reply to a bevy of wom en who were screaming at him at the top of their voices. Indeed, all the women in the place seemed to have con spired to drive him to frenzy by their abuse. When the sheik appeared in the midst of them order was somewhat restored, for, to my surprise, he seemed to take part with the women, and dealt his son one or two sound blows. Then there was some palavering, and during the whole time I saw the wife of the enraged young man looking calmly on as a spectator. She had put her child in its cradle and was rocking it. Two or three old women were crying and still vociferating. Presently I saw a man come and lift the cradle with the baby, and the mother rose and followed him. They went into a neighbouring house, and were followed by the sheik and as many as could crowd in. Then ensued a long pause, until the sheik reappeared, with a document which he had been writing, in his hand, and the village popu lation gathered around. At this time I could not see his son anywhere, but the wife was among the audience. When he had finished reading, the audience broke up and the sheik returned to me. When I asked what had been the matter, he replied, \"Oh, foolish people quarrelling.\" So I applied elsewhere for information, and was told that for some time past the sheik's son had been tired of his wife and in love with another woman, and had been seeking a cause of quar rel. He had apparently found it in some dispute he had just been having with his wife, and had uttered in his rage the"], [105, "THE DRUSES OF MOUNT CARMEL. 91 formula of divorce, by which he dismissed her and sent her back to her family. Hence the feminine outbreak against him. The sheik had disapproved his son's conduct, as the wife was his own niece, and, therefore, her husband's first cousin, and he considered it a family disgrace; but, after what had happened, patching up the matter had become im possible, and he had nothing for it but, according to Druse law, to pronounce the divorce. I must say that the entire in difference manifested by the wife, when she followed her baby's cradle away from her husband's house, deprived her of the sympathy I should otherwise have felt. From what I have been able to gather, the Druse women, if they are pretty, are a heartless lot. Another characteris tic incident was a procession of Esfia Druses to the cave of Elijah, below the monastery, in fulfilment of a vow, when a child was dedicated to a religious life, and a goat was sacri ficed to God, as in the times of old. After being sacrificed, it was nevertheless eaten, which seems somewhat to deprive the performance of its merit, as the share of the Deity was the bones. There was a great clanging of discordant in struments and loud singing as they came back, some of the men caracoling around on horseback, and others, with arms clasped, dancing in a measured step, followed by a group of dancing women, in dark-blue garments, with gaudy bor ders and fringes and sashes, and flowing white head-dresses bound with bright - coloured scarfs. They formed a most picturesque tableau, chanting their way to their home on this wild mountain hill-top. One day a magnificent figure of a man, armed with sword and pistol, suddenly entered my tent. I asked him where he had come from. He said from the Jebel Druse, and, seeing a foreign tent, he had turned in to see who I was. So we exchanged confidences. He was, in fact, an outlaw. He had been fighting against the government, and was wander ing from one Druse village to another, not daring to go back to his own, which was in the Lebanon. He said that at this moment the Druses of the Jebel Druse were in full revolt against the Turkish government; that no Druse dare show himself in Damascus, and no Turk dare show himself in the Jebel Druse. They had defied the Governor-General, who"], [106, "92 HAIFA knew that it would be useless in their wild mountains to at tempt to conquer them. He offered to take me to the Jebel Druse, if I would avoid all places where there were any Turks. He had a profound contempt for his coreligionists of Dalieh and Esfia. \"I am ashamed of such Druses,\" he said. \" Why, I saw a Moslem insult one, the other day, and, instead of killing him, he walked away. Why don't they leave a place where they dare not punish insult, and come to the mountain?\" I have rarely seen a finer specimen of humanity than this man was, and, with all the' defiant reck lessness and daring of his expression, there was the charm of entire frankness and good-nature combined with it. Besides the two villages on Carmel, there are fourteen Druse villages, nearly all within sight of it, on the southern slopes of the mountains of Galilee. It is not improbable that, unable to support the military conscription and taxa tion which presses uj>on them, the inhabitants may, before long, abandon their present homes, and go to swell the num bers of their brethren in the Jebel Druse. The whole pop ulation of the Druse nation is about 120,000; they can put into the field 25,000 men of the best fighting material in Turkey ; they are slowly migrating to the Jebel Druse, where about two thirds of the nation have already asserted their semi-independence."], [107, "EXPLORATION ON CARMEL. Haifa, Sept. 24. \u2014 During the two months that I have been camped on the highest summit of Mount Carmel, I have visited no fewer than twenty ruins of ancient towns and villages. Of these I have discovered six which were hereto fore unknown, the others having been found ten years ago by the officers of the Royal Engineers sent out to survey Palestine by the Society for Palestine Exploration. Prior to that time, this historic locality was a terra in cognita. The tourists who visited the mountain, like the pil grims who journeyed thither for devotional reasons, satisfied themselves with a short stay at the convent, and even then did not understand that they were only on one mountain spur of a highland region thirty-five miles in circumference, where almost every hilltop was crowned with a ruin, and every gorge might open up new and unexjuected beauties of scenery. It is only after so exhaustive an examination as I have just accomplished that any idea can be formed of the extent of the population by which Carmel was once inhabited, of the high state of civilization which must have prevailed here, and of the extent to which its lovely hills and valleys were cultivated. These ruins bear a great resemblance to each other ; and although they none of them cover a very great extent of ground, they were built of most solid materials, and, to judge by some of the architectural remains, and the elaborate carvings and devices, they must have contained some handsome buildings. The houses were built of blocks of drafted stone, usually four feet long by two and a half high, and two thick. The door-jambs and lintels, which in some instances are still in situ, were often seven or eight feet long by two feet six by two feet. In these were holes or sockets, in which the"], [108, "HAIFA 94 pivots worked. Some of the lintels over the doors were or namented with devices ; these were usually hexagons and circles, in the centre of which were ovals or other orna mental scrolls. Sometimes there was a bird or an animal, such as an eagle or a leopard, or seven-branched candlesticks, or raised bosses or crosses; here and there was a cornice with a florid carving, evidently of the Roman period, with frag ments of columns or capitals. But some of these ruins have been inhabited by later inhabitants, who used the old stones for their modern constructions, and too often chipped off the carving. Indeed, they are the ready-made quarries of the country people of the present day, who come and carry off the stones to build their houses. A notable and melancholy instance of this has occurred in the case of a place called Khurbet Semmaka. This was the most interesting ruin in Carmel, and was discovered ten years ago by the officers of the Palestine Exploration Sur vey. Here they found the portal of what once had been an ancient Jewish synagogue still standing, its door-jambs and lintels elaborately carved, part of the walls and fragments of the columns which formed an enclosing colonnade were in position, and formed the subject of much speculation, as it was the only specimen of Jewish architecture in this part of the country, and presented some features which were dif ferent from anything hitherto discovered; and it was there fore suggested that the building must have been built at a different period from any of those the remains of which still exist. Judge of my disappointment on visiting this spot to find that, with the exception of three feet of one door-jamb, all had disappeared; there was scarcely a stone left. The inhabitants of a Moslem village about two miles distant had within the last decade made a clean sweep of all these most interesting remains. Fortunately they still exist in the Palestine Society's Memoirs in the shape of most elaborate drawings and measurements, which were made by the Sur vey and have since been published. Apart from the actual stones themselves and the carvings which are to be found upon them, the objects of interest which mainly characterize all these Carmel ruins are ancient olive-mills and wine-presses, often in a very perfect state of"], [109, "EXPLORATION ON CARMEL. 95 preservation, tombs and cisterns. First, in regard to the olive-mills. I found more than a dozen of these. On two occasions they were hewn out of the living rock. The lower stone, which was circular, had usually a diameter of eight feet, with a raised rim outside nine or ten inches high, and a raised socket in the centre, in which *was a hole a foot square, where the upright was fitted to hold the lateral beam which worked the upper stone. This was usually five feet in diameter and eighteen inches thick, and had a hole pierced through the centre. Through this the long beam was passed, to which, as it extended far bejTond the circumference of the lower stone, the horse was attached which worked the mill, the upper stone travelling on its broad edge around the lower stone, over the olives. From the lower stone a gutter was carved into the vat, also hewn out of the living rock, into which trickled the oil. I often found near these mills huge limestone rollers about three feet in diameter and seven feet long. On the sides of these were four vertical lines of sunk grooves, four or five grooves in each line. Taking 2.7 as the specific gravity of the stone, they must have weighed about two tons each. What their functions were, or whether they had anything to do with the olive-crushing process, I am at a loss to conjecture. The wine-presses were nothing more than huge vats, also hewn out of the living rock, sometimes above ground, in the shape of sarcophagi, sometimes pits eight or nine feet square and the same in depth. The limestone hillsides in the neighbourhood of these ruins were almost invariably honeycombed with cave tombs, whose doorways were often rudely ornamented with devices, and in one instance I found an inscription in Greek characters so much defaced that I could not decipher it. They usually consisted of only one chamber, eight or ten feet square, but were sometimes larger, and contained either kokim or loculi under arcosolia, sometimes both. The^ kokim are tunnel shaped excavations, usually seven feet long, two feet six wide, and the same in height \u2014 in other words, just large enough to contain a corpse. The loculus is an oblong tomb, with sides about two feet high, also large enough convenient ly to contain a body. It is cut out of the living rock, as well as the arch which overspans it. Sometimes there is a large,"], [110, "HAIFA. 96 arched recess opening out of the central chamber, containing several loculi. On more than one occasion I found a circu lar stone like a millstone in a groove in the doorway, which only required to be rolled a couple of feet to close the tomb completely, but the tombs are generally closed by an oblong stone slab, not unfrequently ornamented with devices. I also found several sarcophagi. The cisterns are of two kinds, bell-mouthed and of demi john shape, or open rock-hewn reservoirs or tanks. At one ruin I found an extensive system of these latter. There were no fewer than six, of which the largest was forty feet square, all close together, divided only by narrow ledges of the solid rock out of which they had been hewn. They were from fifteen to twenty feet to the soil at the bottom, now over grown with shrubs, so that in reality they are probably much deeper. In some cases stone steps lead to the bottom, and on the sides were deep niches from which evidently sprang arches to form the roof, for there can be little doubt that the most of them were originally covered. From the great num ber and extent of these cisterns it is manifest that the in habitants were, in some instances, entirely dependent upon them for their water supply. At the southeastern extremity of the mountain is the spot known as \" the place of burning,\" or sacrifice, because tra dition assigns it as the locality where Elijah had his contro versy with the prophets of Baal, and in commemoration thereof the Carmelite monks are at this moment building a church there, and using, by the way, some of the carved stones of a neighbouring ruin, regardless of all antiquarian considerations. I feel, therefore, a malignant satisfaction in the conviction at which I have arrived that they are build ing their church on a spot which is indisputably not the place on which the altar of Elijah was erected, if we are to believe the Biblical record, for it is in full view of the Medi terranean, and it would have been quite unnecessary for Elijah to tell his servant to \"go up and look toward the sea,\" for there is no higher point to go up to, and he could see the sea himself. But about a mile from this spot there stands, curiously enough, a pile of stones in a locality which would exactly fulfil the required conditions. I came upon"], [111, "EXPLORATION ON CARMEL. 97 it unexpectedly, almost concealed in a thicket of underwood. The stones are placed one upon the other without cement, and average eighteen inches square and eight or nine thick, forming a rude altar about twelve feet long and four high. The breadth varies, as they have been broken away, but there is a large artificial slab, six feet square, lying at the base. Though I do not for a moment mean to imply that this was the original altar, the unusual shape and position of this pile suggests that it may have been the result of some sacred tradition connected with the Biblical event, or it may be the remains of an ancient vineyard watch-tower. From it the ground swells back and upward in every direction, so that a vast host might have been assembled around and witnessed whatever was going forward, which would have been impossible at the traditional locality. A ten minutes' walk would have taken Elijah's servant to a neigh bouring summit which commanded a full view of the sea, and the twelve barrels of water required to drench the altar could have been obtained from some rock-hewn tanks in the immediate vicinity, while the path that passes the pile leads straight down to the hill on the bank of the Kishon, where tradition has it that the priests were massacred. Moreover, it was in the centre of the most populous part of the mountain. Within a radius of two miles and a half from this pile of stones there are no fewer than twelve ruins of ancient towns and villages on the various hill -tops and mountain -spurs which surround it. No fact could give a better idea than this of the populous character of Carmel in the days of the prophet. Not very far from this I discovered, half-way down the steep flank of the mountain, a fortress of a most ancient race, the stones which were piled one above another three high to form the rampart being immense natural unhewn boulders weighing from two to three tons each. I am not aware of anything of the kind having yet been found in Palestine, and as carry ing one back to a period probably anterior to Jewish occu pation, I regard it as the most interesting discovery I have made on Carmel. 7"], [112, "A PLACE FAMOUS IN HISTORY. St. Jean d'Acee, Oct. 14. \u2014 Of all the towns on the Syrian coast, from Antioch to Gaza, none has had a more eventful history than Acre, or one which more directly affected the fortunes of the rest of the country at large. Napoleon I. called it the key of Palestine, and it is doubtless owing to its important strategical position that it has undergone so many vicissitudes, and been the scene of so many sanguinary battles. There is, indeed, probably no similar area on the face of the globe on which so much blood has been shed. I was at some trouble the other day to add up the list of sieges it has undergone, and the total was fifteen, not count ing doubtful ones in the earliest history of the country, when it was invaded and conquered by the ancient Egyp tians; but beginning with the siege of Acre by Shalmaneser, 721 b.c, when the fortress belonged to the Tyrians, and ending with its bombardment, in a. d. 1840, by the English Admiral Sir Charles Napier, the list is one which suggests a record of blood unparalleled in history. Its worst time was undoubtedly during the two hundred years when it was taken and retaken several times by Crusaders and Saracens successively. On one of these occasions when, after a two years' siege, the town fell into the hands of the Saracens, sixty thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the sword. The place is still shown, at the northeast salient of the outer wall, where stood the English tower, which was guarded by the troops of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion. The town now contains only about nine thousand inhabi tants, cooped up by the fortifications in the very limited area of about fifty acres; and it is more picturesque than agreeable to live in. There is no more characteristic bazaar in the East than that of Acre, with its motley crowd of wild Bedouins from the desert, Persian devotees gathering"], [113, "A PLACE FAMOUS IN HISTORY. 99 around a Persian holy man who has taken up his residence here, Turkish soldiers who form its garrison, Druses, with their white turbans and striped abeihs, or overcoats, Meta walis, who are wild and gipsy-looking Moslem schismatics, Syrian Christians, and Moslem peasantry; add to these veiled women, long strings of camels, with an occasional foreigner, or sailor from a merchant-ship in the harbour, and you get a population as varied as any town in the country can show. Acre, therefore, is a most interesting place to spend a day in, apart from any antiquarian attraction it may possess, or monuments of more modern architecture which are worthy of attention. There are few finer mosques in Syria than that of Jezzar Pacha, which stands within a large rectangular area, where there are vaulted galleries, supported by ancient columns ornamented by capitals brought from the ruins of Tyre and C\u0153sarea. Along these galleries have been built cells, des tined for the people employed at the mosque, or the pil grims who came to visit it. They surround a magnificent court, under which are cisterns, and upon which are palms, cypress, and other trees. Among them are white marble tombs, notably those of Jezzar and Suleiman Pacha. The town contains three other mosques, the columns in which and the pavement have certainly belonged to more ancient buildings. There are four Christian churches in the city, which belong to the Roman Catholics, the Schismatic Greeks, the Maronites, and the United Greeks respectively. Under the house of the Sisters of Nazareth and the neighbouring houses extend vast vaulted cellars which are now divided by walls of separation, and belong to different proprietors; they are doubtless of crusading origin. Deep cisterns also date from that period. Of the same date also are certain remains of walls and vaults near the convent, which are the ruins of a church almost completely destroyed. The most remarkable khan is near the port, called the Khan el Aurid on account of its columns, the galleries surrounding it being built on pillars of gray or red granite, covered by capitals of different orders, brought from more ancient monuments. The citadel, as may be imagined, has often been destroyed and rebuilt. On one side is the military hospital, the lower"], [114, "HAIFA 100 part of which belongs entirely to crusaders' work, and con sists of large subterranean magazines. In the middle is a great court, shaded by fig, palm, and other trees, under which are vaulted galleries and cisterns. Under the ram parts also extend immense ogival vaults, many of which be long to the time of the crusades. These have furnished magazines for later defenders of the fortress, and, during the bombardment by the English in 1840, the principal one ex ploded, with a loss to the defenders of 1600 men, 30 camels, 50 asses, besides horses, cows, and a great store of arms. Some of the guns lying about the ramparts are of old French manufacture, with the dates 1785, '86, '87. They are those which were sent by sea, for the use of Napoleon, but were captured by Sir Sydney Smith, and brought here to serve for the defence of the city. About half a mile from the city walls is an artificial hill or tumulus, called Napoleon's Hill, from the fact that he used it as his headquarters during one of the sieges of Acre. It was occupied for the same pur pose six hundred years before by Richard C\u0153ur de Lion. In ancient times Acre was the most populous and flourish ing port on the sea-coast after the decline of Tyre and Sidon, and contained an immense population; the town must have extended over the plain to the east of the city, which is still rich in ancient debris, fragments of pottery^ and marble carvings. A great part of the modern fortification has been built from the ruins of Athlit, which I have described in a former letter, and which, before it was thus despoiled at the beginning of this century, must have been an ancient cru sading fortress in almost perfect condition. When one thinks how lately it has been destroyed, one is all the more inclined to regret the disappearance of a monument which would have been the most interesting relic of its kind in ex istence. Acre possesses little Biblical interest. It is only mentioned once in the Old Testament, where it is alluded to as being a town from which the tribe of Asher, in whose territory it was situated, did not succeed in driving the Ca naanites, but seemed to have lived with them in it upon friendly terms; and once in the New Testament, where, un der the name of Ptolemais, it was visited by Paul on his way from Greece to Jerusalem."], [115, "A PLACE FAMOUS IN HISTORY. 101 There are many old people now in Acre who tell thrilling stories of the episodes which occurred here during the years when it was occupied by the Egyptians, between 1830 and 1840, and when it became necessary not merely to concil iate the conquerors, but to play a double game of keeping on good terms with the Turks, to whom it was ultimately, and, as it now turns out, foolishly, restored by the British; but none so thrilling as those which they have heard from their fathers, of the incidents which marked the reigns of Jezzar and Abdullah Pacha, especially the former. The fol lowing story was told me by the son of the man who was the confidential secretary of this fiend in human shape, who gloried in the name of \" The Butcher.\" In youth he sold himself to a slave-merchant in Constantinople, and, being purchased by Ali Bey of Egypt, he rose from the humble station of a mameluke to be Governor of Cairo. In 1773 he was placed by the Emir of the Druses in command at Beyrout. There his first act was to seize 50,000 piastres, the property of the emir, and the second to declare that he acknowledged no superior but the sultan. The emir, by the aid of a Russian fleet, drove Jezzar from Beyrout, but he was soon after made Pacha of Acre and Sidon. Under his vig orous rule the pachalik extended from Baalbec on the north to Jerusalem on the south. My informant told me that he was not originally a cruel man, but that one day he was playing with a little daughter who pulled his beard. \" This is very wrong,\" he said; \"how did you learn to play with men's beards ?\" \" Oh,\" she replied, \" I always play with the beards of the mamelukes when they visit the ladies of the harem in your absence.\" This excited a fit of frenzied jeal ousy. Taking an escort, he announced that he was going on an official visit to a distant part of his pachalik. When he was a stage out of Acre, he told his escort to remain where they were, disguised himself, and returned rapidly and secretly to his harem. Here he found all his favourite wives disporting themselves with his mamelukes or military body-guard. Instantly he drew his cimeter and fell, not upon the men, but upon the women. Fifteen of these he is said to have killed with his own hand, and then, growing tired of the effort, he called in some soldiers to complete the"], [116, "HAIFA. 102 massacre, not leaving one alive. My informant did not re member the total number slain. The mamelukes rushed to the great magazines, and swore they would blow themselves up and the whole town if a hair of their heads was touched. They were allowed, therefore, to saddle their horses and ride off in peace; but from that day the whole character of Jezzar Pacha was changed, and he made it a rule never to allow a week to pass without executions. His Jew banker was a handsome man. One day Jezzar complimented him on his looks, and then, calling a servant, ordered him to put out one of the Jew's eyes. Some time after Jezzar ob served that the banker had arranged his turban so as almost to hide the lost eye, and he then, without a moment's hesi tation, had his nose cut off. The poor Jew finally lost his head. The family of this man are still among the chief bankers of Damascus. This butcher also employed his own leisure moments in unexpectedly drawing his sword and cutting off the ears and noses of his favourites and the people about him, and sometimes their heads, with his own hand. This was the man whom Napoleon besieged in Acre, and with whom British troops were unfortunately compelled to ally them selves to prevent the fortress from falling into French hands. My informant told me that during the latter years of Jezzar Pacha's life his character again changed for the better, and he gradually gave up his cruel practices. In fact, he de scribed his cruelty as a monomania produced by a fit of jealousy, which it took him some years to get over."], [117, "THE BABS AND THEIR PROPHET. Haifa, Nov. 7\\ \u2014 The Nahr N'aman, called by the ancients the river Belus, rises in a large marsh at the base of a mound in the plain of Acre called the Tell Kurdany, and, after a short course of four miles, fed by the swampy ground through which it passes, it attains considerable dimensions. Before falling into the sea it winds through an extensive date -grove, and then, twisting its way between banks of fine sand, falls into the ocean scarcely two miles from the walls of Acre. Pliny tells us that glass was first made by the ancients from the sands of this river, and the numerous specimens of old glass which I found in grubbing bear tes timony to the extensive usage of this material in the neigh bourhood. The beach at its mouth was also celebrated as a locality where the shells which yielded the Tyrian purple were to be found in great abundance, and I have succeeded in extracting the dye from some of those I have collected here. It was also renowned for a colossal statue of Mem non, which, according to Pliny, was upon its banks, but the site of this has not been accurately identified. The only point of attraction now upon its waters is a garden belong ing to an eminent Persian, whose residence at Acre is in vested with such peculiar interest that I made an expedition to his pleasure-ground on the chance of discovering some thing more in regard to him than it was possible to do at Haifa. Turning sharply to the right before reaching Acre, and passing beneath the mound upon which Napoleon planted his batteries in 1799, we enter a grove of date-trees by a road bordered with high cactus hedges, and finally reach a causeway which traverses a small lake formed by the waters of the Belus, and which, crossing one arm of the river, lands us upon an island which it encircles. This island, which is"], [118, "104 HAIFA. about two hundred yards long by scarcely a hundred wide, is all laid out in flower-beds and planted with ornamental shrubs and with fruit-trees. Coming upon it suddenly it is like a scene in fairy land. In the centre is a plashing foun tain from which the water is conveyTed to all parts of the garden. The flower-beds are all bordered with neat edges of stone-work, and are sunk below the irrigating channels. Over a marble bed the waters from the fountain come rip pling down in a broad stream to a bower of bliss, where two immense and venerable mulberry-trees cast an impenetrable shade over a platform with seats along the entire length of one side, protected by a balustrade projecting over the waters of the Belus, which here runs in a clear stream, four teen or fifteen feet wide and two or three deep, over a peb bly bottom, where fish of considerable size, and evidently preserved, are darting fearlessly about, or coming up to the steps to be fed. The stream is fringed with weeping wil lows, and the spot, with its wealth of water, its thick shade, and air fragrant with jasmine and orange blossoms, forms an ideal retreat from the heats of summer. The sights and sounds are all suggestive of langour and dolce far niente, of that peculiar condition known to Orientals as kief, when the senses are lulled by the sounds of murmuring water, the odours of fragrant plants, the flickering shadows of foliage, or the gorgeous tints of flowers and the fumes of the nar ghileh. The gardener, a sedate Persian in a tall cap, who kept the place in scrupulous order, gave us a dignified welcome. His master, he said, would not come till the afternoon, and if we disappeared before his arrival we were welcome to spread our luncheon on his table under the mulberry-trees, and sit round it on his chairs; nay, further, he even extend ed his hospitality to providing us with hot water. Thus it was that we took possession of Abbas Effendi's garden before I had the honour of making that gentleman's acquaintance, an act of no little audacity, when I inform you that he claims to be the eldest son of the last incarna tion of the Deity. As his father is alive and resident at Acre \u2014 if one may venture to talk of such a being as resi dent anywhere \u2014 my anxiety to see the son was only ex-"], [119, "THE BASS AND THEIR PROPHET. 105 ceeded by my curiosity to investigate the father. But this, as I shall presently explain, seems a hope that is not likely to be realized. Meantime I shall proceed to give you, so far as I have been able to learn, an account of who Abbas Effendi's father is, and all that I know about him, premising always that I only do so subject to any modification which further investigation may suggest. It is now forty-eight years since a young man of three and-twenty appeared at the shrine of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet, who was made a martyr at Kerbela. He was said to have been born at Shiraz, the son of a merchant there, and his name was Ali Mohammed. It is supposed that ho derived his religious opinions from a certain Indian Mussulman, called Achsai, who instituted a system of re form, and made many disciples. Whether this is so or not, the young Persian soon acquired a pre-eminent reputation for sanctity, and the boldness and enthusiasm of his preach ing and the revolutionary sentiments he uttered attracted many to his teaching. So far as I have been able to judge, he preached a pure morality of the loftiest character, de nouncing the abuses of existing Islam as Christ did the Judaism of his day, and fearlessly incurring the hostility of Persian Phariseeism. A member himself of the Shiite sect of Moslems, he sought to reform it, as being the state re ligion of Persia, and finally went so far as to proclaim him self at. Kufa the bob, or door, through which alone man could approach God. At the same time he announced that he was the Mahdi, or last Imaum, who was descended from Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet, and whom the Shiites be lieve to have been an incarnation of the Deity. Mahdi is supposed by all Persian Moslems not to have died, but to be awaiting in concealment the coming of the last day. As may be imagined, the sudden appearance after so many centuries of a reformer who claimed to be none other than the long - expected divine manifestation, created no little consternation throughout Persia, more especially as, according to tradition, the time had arrived when such a manifestation was to be looked for, and men's minds were prepared for the event. The Persian enthusiast, as soon as his preaching became popular and his pretensions vast,"], [120, "HAIFA 106 roused the most violent hostility, and he was executed at Tabriz in 1849, after a brief career of fourteen years, at the early age of thirty-seven. The tragic circumstances at tending his death enhanced his glory, for he was repeatedly offered his life if he would consent to abate his claims, or even leave the country. He preferred, however, a martyr's crown, and was executed in the presence of a vast multi tude, leaving behind him a numerous and fanatic sect, who have since then been known as the Babs, and whose belief in the founder subsequent persecutions on the part of the government have only served to confirm. The Bab before his execution gave it to be understood that though he was apparently about to die, he, or rather the divine incarnation of which he was the subject, would shortly reappear in the person of his successor, whom, I be lieve, he named secretly. I do not exactly know when the present claimant first made known his pretensions to be that successor, but, at all events, he was universally ac knowledged by the Bab sect, now numbering some hundreds of thousands, and became so formidable a personage, being a man of high lineage \u2014 indeed, it is whispered that he is a relative of the Shah himself \u2014 that he was made prisoner by the government and sent into exile. The Sultan of Turkey kindly undertook to provide for his incarceration, and for some years he was a state prisoner at Adrianople. Finally he was transported from that place to Acre, on giving his parole to remain quietly there and not return to Persia, and here he has been living ever since, an object of adoration to his countrymen, who flock hither to visit him, who load him with gifts, and over two hundred of whom remain here as a sort of permanent body-guard. He is visible only to women or men of the poorest class, and obstinately refuses to let his face be seen by any man above the rank of a fellah or peasant. Indeed, his own dis cijfles who visit him are only allowed a glimpse of his au gust back, and in retiring from that they have to back out with their faces towards it. I have seen a lady who has been honoured with an interview, during which he said nothing beyond giving her his blessing, and after about three minutes motioned to her to retire. She describes"], [121, "THE BARS AND THEIR PROPHET. 107 him as a man of probably about seventy years of age, but much younger -looking, as he dyes both his hair and his beard black, but of a very mild and benevolent cast of countenance. He lives at a villa in the plain, about two two miles beyond Acre, which he has rented from a Syrian gentleman of my acquaintance, who tells me that once or twice he has seen him walking in his garden, but that he al ways turns away so that his face shall not be seen. Indeed, the most profound secrecy is maintained in regard to him and the religious tenets of his sect. Not long ago, however, public curiosity was gratified, for one of his Persian followers stabbed another for having been unworthy of some religious trust, and the great man himself was summoned as a witness. \"Will you tell the court who and what you are?\" was the first question put. \" I will begin,\" he replied, \" by telling you who I am not. I am not a camel driver \" \u2014 this was an allusion to the Proph et Mohammed \u2014 \"nor am I the son of a carpenter\" \u2014 this in allusion to Christ. \"This is as much as I can tell you to-day. If you will now let me retire, I will tell you to morrow who I am.\" Upon this promise he was let go ; but the morrow never came. With an enormous bribe he had in the interval pur chased an exemption from all further attendance at court. That his wealth is fabulous may be gathered from the fact that not long since a Persian emir or prince, possess ing large estates, came and offered them all, if in return he would only allow him to fill his water-jars. The offer was considered worthy of acceptance, and the emir is at this moment a gardener in the grounds which I saw over the wall of my friend's villa. This is only one instance of the devotion with which he is regarded, and of the honours which are paid to him : indeed, when we remember that he is believed to possess the attributes of Deity, this is not to be wondered at. Meantime his disciples are patiently wait ing for his turn to come, which will be on the last day, when his divine character will be recognized by unbelievers."], [122, "AN ANCIENT JEWISH COMMUNITY. Haifa, Nov. 25. \u2014 In one of the most remote and secluded valleys in the mountains of northern Galilee lies a village, the small population of which possesses an interest altogether unique. As I looked down upon it from the precipitous and dangerous path by means of which I was skirting the flank of the mountain, I thought I had rarely seen a spot of such ideal beauty. It was an oasis, not actually in a desert \u2014 for the rocky mountain ranges were covered with wild herbage \u2014 but in a savage wilderness of desolation, in the midst of which the village nestled in a forest of orange, almond, fig, and pomegranate trees, the tiny rills of water by which they were irrigated glistening like silver threads in the sunlight, and the yellow crops beyond contrasting with the dull green of the hill verdure, long deprived of water, and the gray rocks which reared their craggy pinnacles above it. The name of this village was Bukeia. I had heard vaguely of the existence of a spot in Galilee where a community of Jews lived who claimed to be the descendants of families who had tilled the land in this same locality prior to the de struction of Jerusalem and the subsequent dispersion of the race; as it had never been suspected that any remnant of the nation had clung to the soil of their fathers from time immemorial, and as it is certain that this is the only remnant that has, I took some trouble to ascertain the name of the village, and felt that it was worth a pilgrimage to visit it. Although hitherto unknown to Europeans and tourists, it has been for many years a spot much frequented hy the Jews of Safed and Tiberias, and this summer especial ly, when the cholera panic prevailed in the country, there was a perfect rush of the wealthier Jews and rabbis of those towns to its pure air and bracing climate. In a small way it is a sort of Jewish sanatorium."], [123, "AN ANCIENT JEWISH COMMUNITY. 109 But the village does not consist altogether of Jews. In fact, they form the minority of the population, which is com posed of eighty Druse, forty Greek-Christian, and twenty Jewish families, the latter numbering about one hundred and twenty souls in all. Refusing the invitation of the Druse and Christian sheiks to accept their hospitality, I listened rather to the solicitations of the elderly Hebrew who eager ly placed his house at my disposal, and was the patriarch of his coreligionists, his local title being, like those of the heads of the other communities, that of sheik. His house was a stone erection with a court-yard, and contained a single large room, Avhich, as is common in Arab houses, afforded eating and sleeping accommodation for the whole family. On this occasion it soon became crowded to excess. First appeared the Druse sheik, with white turban, and composed and dignified bearing. Then the sheik of the Christians, a man in no way to be distinguished from the or dinary type of native fellahin; then the Greek priest, in his high, round-topped black hat and long black coat, reaching nearly to his feet; then the Jewish rabbi, who officiates at the synagogue, in flowing Eastern robe; then some village notables of all three religions, who all squatted on mats, forming a semicircle, of which my friends and I were the centre, and which involved a large demand upon our host for coffee, for on these occasions it is a great breach of po liteness not to furnish all the uninvited guests who flock in to see distinguished strangers with that invariable beverage. When one or two Moslems, who were temporary visitors to the village, dropped in from curiosity, I could not fail to be struck with the singular ethnological and theological com pound by which I was surrounded. Here, in these Christian and Moslem peasants, Avere the descendants of those ancient Canaanites whom the conquering Jews failed to drive out of the country during the entire period of their occupation of it, though they doubtless served their conquerors as hew ers of wood and drawers of water, and as farm- servants generally; for the result of the most recent and exhaustive research proves, I think, incontestably that the fellahin of Palestine, taken as a whole, are the modern representatives of those old tribes which the Israelites found settled in the"], [124, "110 HAIFA country, such as the Canaanites, Hivites, Jebusites, Amorites, Philistines, Edomites. In what proportion these various tribes are now represented, whether they were preceded by a still older autochthonous population, namely, the Ana kim, Horites, and so forth, are questions which have so far been beyond the reach of scientific research. But though this race, or rather conglomeration of races, which may be designated for want of a better by the vague title of pre- Israelite, still survives beneath the Mohammedan or Chris tian exterior, it has not remained uninfluenced during the lapse of centuries by the many events and circumstances that have happened in Palestine. Each successive change in the social and political condition of the country has more or less affected it in various ways, and we must not be surprised when studying the fellahin at finding Jewish, Hellenic, Rabbinic, Christian, and Mussul man reminiscences mingled pell-mell, and in the quaintest combinations, with traits which may bring us back to the most remote and obscure periods of pre-Israelite existence. Indeed, for anything one could say to the contrary, the Christian fellahin of this village, though they had resisted the proselytizing efforts of the Saracen conquest in the sixth century, may, before they were converted to Christianity, have worshipped the gods of the Gr\u00e6co-Roman period; be fore that they may have been Jews, for there can be little question that the aboriginal population, to some extent, adopted the Jewish faith after the conquest, and before that were worshippers of the Syro-Ph\u0153nician deities, Baal and Ashtaroth. They may in those old times, when Jewish power was supreme, have been in this very village the ser vants of the ancestors of these very Jews who now share its land with them, as they had, according to their traditions, done from the most ancient period; and this means, in a country where genealogies are preserved for centuries upon centuries, a very long time ago. I have a friend at Haifa who says he can trace his ancestry back to the crusades, when his family was resident at the old town of the same name; and, as a grotesque illustration of their pretensions, a story is told of a Bedouin sheik who, being asked whether he was descended from Abraham, said that he could trace"], [125, "AN ANCIENT JEWISH COMMUNITY. 111 further back, and that, in fact, Abraham was not a sheik of a very good family. The only really modern intruders in the group by which I was surrounded were the Druses, who only settled in the village about three hundred years ago, and whose origin prior to nine hundred years ago, when we know that they were settled at Aleppo, is rather obscure; but it is general- ly believed that they were originally a tribe inhabiting the province of Yemen. Here, too, in this small group of Ara- bic-speaking people, were represented four of the most wide- ly divergent religions. There were the two Moslems, whose ancestors, probably, prior to the conquest of Palestine by the Saracens, had been Christians, but had then adopted the faith of the Prophet. There was the priest of the Greek Church, still clinging to the dogmas which he inherited from the first Christians \u2014 the descendant, possibly, of one who had actually listened to the words of Christ and his disciples, in the country which their posterity has never left. And indeed it is a curious reflection in looking at these fel- lahin to think that they may be the direct descendants of some of those thousands who were influenced at the time by the teaching which has since swayed the moral sentiment of civilized humanity. Then there were the Jews \u2014 the only group of Jews existing in the world whose ancestors have clung to the soil ever since that Teacher's tragic death, and whose fathers may have shared in the general hostility to him at the time \u2014 representing still the faith which was the repository of the highest moral teaching prior to Christian- ity, prior to Mohammedanism. Lastly, there were the Druses, in whose esoteric religion is to be found the most extraordinary confusion of metaphysical notions, gnostic and pagan, the outcome of a mystical interweaving of ideas de- rived from the most divergent faiths, with a Magian or Zo- roastrian basis, upon which Hindoo and Buddhist, Jewish and Platonic, Christian and Moslem dogmas have been suc cessively grafted, forming a system so recondite and ab struse that only the initiated can comprehend it, if indeed they can. Such were the mixed religious and race conditions by which I was surrounded, and I was much struck by the ap-"], [126, "112 HAIFA. parent tolerance and amiability with which all the members of these different religions regarded each other. The Jew ish rabbi told me privately that he much preferred Druses to Christians; but he lived on good terms with all. And when I went to see the synagogue the Greek priest strolled round with me, and the rabhi returned the compliment by accompanying us when I went to visit the little Greek church. Meantime, the Hebrew sheik had summoned all the Jewish population, and they came trooping in to perform the usual Eastern salutation of kissing the hand. Old men and maidens, young men and married women and children, I saw them all, nor, so far as dress and facial type were concerned, was it possible to distinguish them from the fel lahin of the country generally. These twenty families seemed all to have descended from one stock, they all had the same name, Cohen, and they have never intermarried either with the people of the country or even with other Jews. I afterwards had some conversation with the Chris tian and Druse sheiks in regard to them. They said that formerly more of the village lands belonged to them, but owing to the wars, pestilences, and other misfortunes which had overtaken the country at various times, their property had become diminished; indeed, there can be little doubt that the Druses themselves, when Fakr Eddin conquered this part of the country, appropriated some of it; so that now, so far as their worldly circumstances go, the Jews are bad ly off. Nevertheless they do not complain, and are skilful, hard-working, and persevering agriculturists, to my mind more deserving of sympathy than many of their coreligion ists who have come to settle in the country as colonists, de pending more upon the assistance which they derive from without than upon their own efforts. The experience and example of their coreligionists at Bukcia would make the neighbourhood of that place a desirable locality for a col ony. From Bukeia I followed a northwesterly direction, by a most picturesque mountain path, and in a few hours reached the romantically situated town of Tershiha, where I was most hospitably entertained by the Cadi, a dignified Arab gentleman of a true old Oriental type which is now becom-"], [127, "AN ANCIENT JEWISH COMMUNITY. 113 ing rare. This place contains about two thousand inhabi tants. They are nearly all the adherents of a certain sheik, Ali el-Mograbi, a Moslem reformer, who emigrated to this place from the north of Africa many years ago, and whose preaching has been attended with remarkable success. As his fame grew he moved to Acre, where he exercises an ex traordinary influence. The tenets of the sect of which he is the head are kept a profound secret, though there is noth ing to distinguish the worship of the initiated from that of any ordinary sect of howling dervishes, to the outside ob server, except the sparing use of the name of Mohammed. It is said, however, that their views are latitudinarian, and, that, so far from being exclusive or fanatic, are rather in the sense of extreme toleration for other religions. Whatever be the nature of their heterodoxy^, it is not now interfered with. Indeed, it is hinted that the sheik counts among his followers some of the most highly placed officials in the em pire, and there can be little doubt that his doctrines are spreading rapidly among Moslems, while even Christians have joined the society*-. A large new mosque is now in progress of erection at Haifa. The sheik himself, whose acquaintance I made subsequently, is now a very old man, regarded with the most extreme veneration by his followers, and the results of his teaching prove that he must be en dowed with gifts of a very high order. 8"], [128, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE SYRIANS. Haifa, March 1, 1884. \u2014 The ordinary tourists in Palestine who write books of their experience have so little oppor tunity of know*ing the conditions which surround the daily life of a resident in a small country town, that a few details of domestic existence here, as contrasted with those of more civilized countries, may not be uninteresting. As a general rule, the foreigner who comes to a native town to settle down as a permanent inhabitant finds himself compelled more or less to adopt the manners and customs of the richer class of Syrians, which gives him an opportunity of becoming ac quainted with their home life. Some of these are wealthy merchants or large landed proprietors, with incomes varying from $5000 to $15,000, though a man whose yearly revenue reached the latter amount, of which he would not spend half, would be considered a millionaire, and few small towns can boast of so great a capitalist. As, owing to the march of civilization, the richer classes have of late years taken to travel and the study of languages, persons occupying this position generally speak either French or Italian, have visited Paris, Constantinople, or Alexandria, and have a thin varnish of European civilization overlaying their native barbarism. The rich families of the Syrian aristocracy are almost in variably Christians, but they have only recently shaken off the manners of their Mohammedan neighbours and con querors. The women associate far more freely than they used to do with the men. They now no longer cover their faces, and although they still wear the \"fustan,\" or white winding-sheet, -which serves as cloak and head-dress in one, it nearly always conceals a dress of European make, while, instead of bare feet thrust into slippers, they have Paris bot tines and stockings. The men of this class also dress in European garments, wearing, however, the red fez cap."], [129, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE SYRIANS. 115 The domestic arrangements of a family of this description are by no means so refined in character as the external as pect of the house and its proprietor, when he is taking his exercise on a gorgeously caparisoned Arab horse, would sug gest. If we are on sufficiently intimate terms with him to stay as a guest in his house, we find that his pretty wife, with her Paris dress and dainty chaussure, walks about in the privacy of the domestic home with bare, or at best stock inged, feet, thrust into high wooden pattens, with which she clatters over the handsome marble hall that forms the central chamber of the house, slipping out her feet and leaving the pattens at the door of any of the rooms she may be about to enter. She wears a loose morning-wrapper, which she is not particular about buttoning, but in this respect she is outdone by sundry dishevelled maid-servants, who also clatter about the house in pattens and in light garments that seem to re quire very little fastening in front. As for the husband, who, when he called upon you, might have come off the boule vards of Paris, barring always the red cap, he has now re verted absolutely into the Oriental. He wears a long white and not unbecoming garment that reaches from his throat to his heels, and his feet are thrust into red slippers. As he sips his matutinal cup of coffee and smokes his first narghileh of the clay, there is nothing about him to remind you that he knows a word of any other language than Arabic, or has ever worn any other costume than that of his Eastern ancestors. He is sitting in his own little den, with his feet tucked under him on the divan which runs around the room, and with his wife in close proximity, her feet tucked under her, and also smoking a narghileh and sipping coffee. Yet, if you call upon this worthy couple as a distinguished foreigner, in the afternoon, accompanied by your wife, and are not on intimate terms, you are received in a room which they never enter, except upon such state occasions, by the same gentleman, in a perfectly fitting black frock-coat and trousers, varnished boots, and a white waistcoat, and by the same lady, in a dress which has been made in Paris. The furniture consists of massive tables with marble tops, and handsome arm-chairs and couches covered with costly satins. The walls are resplendent with gilt mirrors and with"], [130, "HAIFA 116 heavy hanging curtains. The floors are covered with rich carpets. There is a three-hundred-dollar piano, on which the lady never plays; and there are pictures, of which the frames are more artistic than the subjects \u2014 the whole having the air of a show repository of some sort. Indeed, if your host is at all taken by surprise, the first thing he does is to open all the shutters, as, except upon such occasions, the apartment is one of silent and absolute gloom. He has a guest-chamber, also furnished after a civilized style, in which he puts you, if you are going to stay with him, and he has so far adopted civilized habits that he sleeps on a bed himself, and not on mats on the floor, like his forefathers. His dinner is served on a table, which is spread as he has seen it spread in the houses of foreigners, but he retains the native cooking, the huge pillaw of rice, the chicken stew with rich and greasy gravy, the lamb stuffed with pistachio nuts, the leben or sour milk, the indescribable sweet dishes, crisp, sticky, and nutty, the delicious preserves of citrons, dates, and figs, the flat bread \"and the goat cheese, and the wine of the country. Altogether, he gives you plenty to eat, drink, and smoke, but his conversational powers and ideas are limited, which is not to be wondered at, considering that there is not a book in the house. He tells you that the house cost him $9000, which does not seem likely to be an exaggeration when we look at the handsome marble floors and staircase, massive arches, and the extent of ground which is covered by spacious halls and ample courts. The kitchen and offices, if y-ou have the curiosity to look into them, are filthy in the extreme, and the process of cook ing the dinner, performed by a slovenly female, had better not be too closely examined. His domestic establishment probably consists of four women and two or three men who look after the stables, in which are three or four handsome horses, and a garden requiring constant attention. He has no wheeled vehicle, for there are no roads. The women rarely take any other exercise than that of waddling on gossiping visits to each other, when their conversation turns entirely on domestic subjects, on the marital traits of their respective husbands, on congratulations on the arrival of children, if they are boys, and condolences if they are girls, and on hope-"], [131, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE SYRIANS. 117 ful speculation and encouragement if there are none at all ; for of all misfortunes which can befall a Syrian lady, to be childless is the greatest. If there are grown-up daughters they are carefully protected from intimacy with young men, and marriages are arranged by the parents. The chances of making a good match depend more on the amount of the marriage-settlement than on their looks. If the family hap pens to be a large one it is not uncommon to see a yroung lady who has been brought up in what, in Syria, is consid ered luxury, married to some poor and distant connection, whose family live in the humblest manner. In such a case the contrast is greater than can be imagined in our country. She is transferred from the palatial residence I have de scribed to a one-storied house which probably does not con sist of more than two rooms, and where her husband's fam ily live in the old style. Here she is received, perhaps, by his mother and sister, with whom she is to live; who wear the pure native costume ; who have never had a shoe or stocking on in their lives; who sleep on mats on the 'floor, for there are no bedsteads; who partake of their meals squat ting on their heels, for there are no chairs or tables; and who eat with their fingers, for there are no knives and forks. If the newly married couple do not occupy the same room with the rest of the family, they share the other one with the domestic animals. These probably consist of a horse, a cow, and a donkey. For the sake of security they are stabled in the room of the master of the house. Their manger is on a level with the floor on which he and his bride sleep. I have before now shared such a room with a young married couple \u2014 she, the daughter of a wealthy man who lived in civilized style \u2014 and all night I have been disturbed by the crunching of the animals feeding within a few feet of where I was lying; with their constant rising up and lying down; with the movements of my host and hostess, who would get up constantly in the night, sometimes to feed the animals, which were required for work before sunrise, sometimes to replenish the charcoal fire, sometimes to attend to the baby, or to open the door and hold a whispered conference with some nocturnal visitor. As there is no undressing on going to bed, among these people, and as they indulge in long"], [132, "118 HAIFA, snoozes during the day, the night does not seem to be so especially devoted to sleep as with us. They appear to think that, as going to bed simply consists in lying down on the floor in your clothes, one part of the twenty-four hours will do as well for sleep as another, and their nights are restless accordingly. As a general rule, for persons who have not been long enough in the country to get used to insects, the nights are made restless from other causes. It is curious, in the case of such a marriage as I have described, to see the change which takes place when the young wife leaves the retired village to which she has been banished, owing to the impoverished circumstances of her hus band, to pay a visit to her own family. I scarcely recognize her when I meet her again. When last I saw her in her humble home her costume consisted of a thin sort of chemi sette, a pair of full, baggy trousers fastened at the knee, leaving the legs and feet bare, and over these a skirt, and we were dipping our fingers amicably into the same dish of rice. Now I would walk down Broadway with her on my arm, and be rather proud of her fashionable \" get up \" than otherwise; and she handles her knife and fork with far greater dexter ity than I did my fingers. The wave of civilization is, however, rapidly encroaching upon these humbler classes. It is only natural that a girl brought up in this way should endeavour to introduce in novations into her husband's home. Within the last few years there has been a marked change in this respect, par ticularly in a town like Haifa, where the Christian popula tion largely predominates. A veiled face is rarely to be seen, while women, even of the poorer classes, are introducing the fashion of wearing gowns, adding a table and a few chairs to their domestic furniture, and have even gone the length of sleeping on bedsteads, though I have not yet pried suf ficiently into nocturnal mysteries to know whether, when they go to bed, they have progressed in civilization so far as to undress."], [133, "FISHING ON LAKE TIBERIAS. Haifa, April 2. \u2014 I have just returned from a trip into the interior, during which I have been exploring some new and interesting country. Instead of following the usual road to the eastward by way of the valley of Esdraelon, I struck in a northeasterly direction across the fertile plain of Acre, fording the Kishon at the point of its debouchure into the sea, where, after the winter rains, we are generally obliged to swim the horses, while we cross ourselves in a ferry boat. In two hours from this point we strike the first low range of the Galilee hills, at a depression from which, in the times of the crusaders, the armies of Saladin used to issue forth to give them battle. Indeed, the whole ground over -which we ride has been from time immemorial the scene of bloody warfare, and it is not impossible, considering how events are shaping themselves in the East, that it may be come so again. Rising gently, by grassy vales carpeted with wild flowers, to a height of about five hundred feet, we shortly reach the picturesquely situated town of Shefr Amr, dominated by the extensive walls of its ruined castle. This has been a place of considerable importance ever since, shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was the seat of the Jewish sanhedrim. It was then called Shefaram, and is probably ideutical with the Kefraim which Eusebius says was six miles north of Legio, and with Hapraim, which we read in the Bible was assigned to the tribe of Issachar. Since then its name has been changed to Shefr Amr, or \" the healing of Omar,\" from a tradition that Daher el-Amr, a prince who governed this country about a hundred and sixty years ago, recovered here from a severe illness. The fortress is said to have been built by his son Othman in 1761, and it does not appear to be older, though probably it"], [134, "120 HAIFA. occupies the site of a much more ancient castle. It covers a very extensive area of ground, with crenellated battlements, and contains stalls for four hundred horses. It is now partly ruined, but a portion of it is still sufficiently well preserved to be the residence of the Mudir, or local gov ernor. I scrambled by a most dilapidated stone stair to the top of the walls, and had a magnificent view over the surround ing country. The position is so commanding that I could well understand why Saladin chose it as a point from which he could harass the Franks who were besieging Acre, which town was plainly visible in the distance. I was informed that the whole of this extensive fortress was offered by tho government for sale for $1500. The stones alone would bo worth more than this amount, if it were not for the cost of transport, to say nothing of the area of land which they cover. But, as a matter of speculation, Barnum's pink-and white elephant would be about as convenient a possession for a private individual. It is no wonder that it has been for some time in the market, or that the town itself, when capital is so scarce, should be a sleepy looking, stagnant place. Still, it is better built than the average; the houses are generally constructed of stone \u2014 many of them are of two stories \u2014 there is a fair bazaar, and a population of about two thousand five hundred inhabitants, of which fifteen hundred are Greek Christians, three hundred Moslems, six hundred Druses, and the remainder Jews. Some thirty fam ilies of Morocco Jews settled here as agriculturists about the year 1850, but after struggling against extortion for twenty years they had to give it up, and the colony is now extinct, the Jews now here being natives of the country. The Druse population is also rapidly diminishing from the same cause; a slow but steady migration takes place annu ally to the Druse mountains to the east of the Hauran, where they are practically independent of government con trol; there are also a few Protestants here, with a school house, besides a convent and church of the Roman Catholic nuns (Dames de Nazareth), built in 1866, with a girls' school. The only other interesting building at Shefr Amr is the"], [135, "FISHING ON LAKE TIBERIAS. 121 Greek church, which has been rebuilt on old foundations. The remains were evidently Byzantine work, dating proba bly from the fifth or sixth century. Many interesting tombs are to be found both north and south of the town. The most noteworthy has a handsome facade, covered with a de sign of a vine with grapes in bold relief, and with small fig ures of birds introduced. Each vine-plant grows out of a pot. On each side of the door is an effaced Greek inscrip tion, with rosettes in lozenges below and birds above. Here, also, are fragments of Greek inscriptions, and on the left side-wall of the vestibule is a bas-relief of a lion and a small animal, perhaps a cub; on the right a lion, a cub, and a bird. The drawing is very primitive, and has a Byzan tine appearance. Inside this tomb, which contains three loculi, there are mouldings round the principal arch, with tracery of vines and carvings of birds. These tombs are in teresting because both the inscriptions and ornamentation belong to the Byzantine period, thus proving that the mode of sepulture practised by the Jews from the most remote date was continued by the Christians up to the fifth or sixth century after Christ. Our way from Shefr Amr led through the beautiful oak woods which belong to that town, but which seem doomed to destruction, for I observed that many of the handsomest trees were girdled near the base, while numerous stumps bore testimony to this lamentable work of denudation. In a country where wood is becoming so rare it was heart breaking to ride through this beautiful, park-like scenery and witness the work of destruction going on in spite of the government prohibition against felling timber. Emerging from these grassy glades we descend into the magnificent plain of the Buttauf, now a sheet of emerald green, as the young crops extend before us as far as the eye can reach. Traversing this fertile country one is more and more impressed with the incorrectness of the judgment of the ordinary tour ist, who, confining himself to the route prescribed by Cook, is taken through the barren hills of Judea, and to one or two holy places in Galilee, and then goes home and talks about the waste and desolation of Palestine. The trite say ing recurred to my mind as I looked on this wealth of grain :"], [136, "122 HAIFA \" I pity the man who can go from Dan to Bcersheba and say that all is barren;\" or, as my travelling - companion, who was an American, more forcibly put it: \"If ever I meet a tourist who tells me that Palestine is barren, I'll lick him.\" But we were not on the tourist track, and it was not till we reached Tiberias that we found specimens, and they -were too discreet in their remarks to give my friend an opportu nity of expressing his views in the manner contemplated. Here we took a boat and crossed the lake. I wanted to in vestigate the present fishing capabilities of these waters, but I soon found that I had not the appropriate tackle. The natives either fish with circular hand-nets, which they throw with great dexterity, or with long hand - lines, which they bait with small dead fish and haul in, thus trawling in a rough way. They have no idea of fishing with a rod, and mine came to grief, so that I had no opportunity of casting a fly, but I think it not unlikely, from the way I saw the fish jumping towards evening, that they would rise to it. The natives catch their bait by poisoning the water with pinches of a powder which they throw in near the margin. In a few moments the minnows and small fish are to be seen swimming lazily along the surface, completely stupefied, and one has only to put one's hand in and take them out. The fish we caught were principally of the bass or perch species, averaging half a pound or more each. One of the boatmen caught a dozen with two or three casts of the hand-net, but it was useless to try with a rod without proper tackle. I am convinced that a spinning artificial minnow, or a copper spoon, would be very killing; so, of course, would be trawl ing live bait, but the natives know only their own primitive. style of fishing, and the idea of a rod and line, even with the common angle-worm at one end and a fool at the other, was entirely new to them. Indeed, scarcely any fish are taken from the lake. There are only four boats on it, but these are used more for transport than fishing purposes, and the population is so sparse on the shores that there is no de mand. We were assured by our boatmen, however, that they occasionally took fish over five feet in length, and I have seen enough of what may be done to decide me to go"], [137, "FISHING ON LAKE TIBERIAS. 123 there again some day properly provided, instead of relying on native appliances. The spot at which we were moored on the eastern shore of the lake was immediately under a precipitous conical shaped hill, which rose abruptly to a height of twelve hun dred feet from the waters. Its summit was crowned with the ruins of the ancient city of Gamala. The modern name for it is Kalat el-Hosn, but it owes its ancient appellation to its shape, which is exactly that of a camel's hump. It is interesting as having been a purely Jewish fortification, the last that was sacked by Vespasian and Titus before the siege of Jerusalem, and it has remained to this day exactly as they left it. Josephus gives a very graphic account of the siege, which took place in the last days of September, sixty-nine years after the birth of Christ. Owing to the precipices by which it was surrounded it was supposed to be impregnable, and when, at last, after a twenty-nine days' siege, it was found not to be so, the whole popula tion who had survived its horrors, consisting of five thou sand men, women, and children, flung themselves into the yawning gulf below the ramparts, thus perishing by their own act. Of the entire population only two women es caped alive. When we compare the fighting of those days with the siege of Paris, for instance, where the population surren dered because there was a little too much sawdust in the bread, the results of modern as contrasted\" with ancient civ ilization suggest some curious reflections. That the civiliza tion of those days was of a high order is attested by the magnificent remains which still exist in Gamala. Here are to be found, strewn over the ground, some thirty huge granite columns, which must have been transported from Egypt to this giddy height by engineering contrivances which would puzzle the science of these days, and Corin thian capitals neatly cut in hard, black basalt, and sar cophagi and other monuments, all evidencing a high state of art. These ruins have hitherto been only superficially exam ined, and there can be no doubt that the investigations of the Palestine Exploration Fund, when the society is per-"], [138, "124 HAIFA. mitted by the Turkish government to prosecute their re searches to the east of the Jordan, will bring many interest ing treasures to light. I only regretted that I had no time to give to these ruins, as my objective point lay farther to the south and east."], [139, "A VISIT TO THE SULPHUR SPRINGS OF AMATHA. Haifa, April 15. \u2014 At the spot where the Jordan issues from Lake Tiberias there are two large mounds, a fragment of sea-wall, and a causeway on arches which projects into the river, dividing it from the waters of the lake, and suggest ing that it may possibly, in ancient times, have formed the approach to a bridge. There is no bridge there now. The river swirls sound the arches, which are choked with ruins and reeds, and in a broad, swift stream winds its way to the Dead Sea. Here, in old time, stood the Roman city of Ta rich\u0153a, built on the site of a Ph\u0153nician fortress of still older date. Nothing remains but heaps of rubbish covered with broken pottery, and fragments of sculpture; but it offers, probably, a rich field for future excavation. The modern name Kerak signifies in Syriac \" fortress,\" and its natural position was remarkably strong, as the Jordan, after leaving the lake, takes a sharp bend to the westward and flows al most parallel with it, thus leaving an intervening peninsula on which the town was situated. It was defended on the westward by a broad ditch, traces of which still remain, con necting the Jordan with the lake, thus making the peninsula an island approached only by a causeway. Josephus mentions Tarich\u00e6a as having been an important military post in the wars of his time. When I visited it the lake was unusually high, and the Jordan was unfordable, so we were obliged to ferry over, swimming our horses and mules a distance of seventy or eighty yards across the rapid current. Then we mounted, and galloped in a southeasterly direction, over a fertile plain, waving at this season of the year with luxuriant crops. I was so much struck with the fertility and agricultural capacity of this region that I made inquiry as to its ownership, and found that it had been presented by a former sultan to one of the principal Bedouin sheiks of this"], [140, "126 HAIFA. Eastern country, and that he was exempt from all taxation. His lands extend to the foothills, where the Yarmuk issues from the mountains of Gilead and Jaulan, which we were now approaching. We had ascended these but a little way when a scene burst upon us which surprised and delighted us by its wild and unexpected grandeur. The Yarmuk here enters the plain of the Jordan on its way to join that river, with a volume of water fully equal to the latter, pouring its swollen torrent between two perfectly perpendicular preci pices of basalt, which are about two hundred yards apart, and look like some majestic gateway expressly designed by nature to afford the river a fitting outlet to the plain after its wild course through the mountains. On each side of these cliffs the country swells back abrupt ly to a height of seventeen hundred feet above the stream. At their base, here and there, the limestone or basalt rock, for the two formations are curiously intermixed, crops out sharp ly, forming terraces with precipitous sides. The more distant summits are fringed with oak forests. The general effect of the landscape, as you first burst upon it after leaving the Jordan valley, is in the highest degree impressive. The path, gradually ascending, winds along the edge of cliffs, rising to a sheer height of three hundred feet from the torrent which foams beneath. We are so close to their margin on the right that it makes us giddy to look down, while on the left hand grassy slopes, covered with wild flowers, rise to the base of other cliffs above us. For an hour we wind along these dizzy ledges. In one place I observed a hundred feet of limestone superimposed upon two hundred of basalt, the whole forming a black-and-white precipice very remarkable to look upon. In fact, my further investigations of this valley of the Yarmuk, some portion of which, I believe, we were the first to explore, have convinced me that it affords finer scenery than is to be found in any other part of Pales tine. It is astonishing that it should have remained until now almost entirely unknown. Where the valley opened a little we saw beneath us a small plain, almost encircled by the river, and on it about twenty Bedouin tents. Our unex pected and novel appearance on the cliff above evidently caused some little stir and amazement, but they were too far"], [141, "A VISIT TO THE SULPHUR SPRINGS OF AMATHA. 127 below us to communicate with, so we pushed on to a point where the path suddenly plunged down by a series of steps between walls of black basalt, making a very steep descent for loaded mules, and one not altogether pleasant for mounted men. It had the advantage of bringing us soon to the bot tom, however, but not before my eyes were gladdened by the sight of one of the objects for which I had undertaken the trip. At my feet, and separated from the river by a narrow strip of land covered with bushes, was a long pool of bluish- gray water, in marked contrast with the yellow stream. Above it floated a very light mist, or, rather, haze. Follow- ing with the eye a little stream of the same coloured water which entered it, past a primitive mill, I saw that it de- bouched from another pond similar in colour, and evidently its source, and to this our path was conducting us. It was the first of the hot sulphur springs of Amatha, celebrated by Eusebius as being much frequented in the time of the Romans, and famous for their healing qualities. We soon reached its margin, and, dismounting, tethered our horses under the shade of a large tree, and stretched ourselves for a rest after our ride, preparatory to a slight repast and a more minute investigation of the springs and the ruins by which they are surrounded. Our nostrils were regaled by a strong odour of rotten eggs, which left no doubt in our minds as to the quality of the water in the immediate neigh- borhood. We were here at a depression of five hundred and fifty feet below the surface of the sea, but the climate, which must be intolerably hot in summer, was at this time of year delightful. We were soon sufficiently rested to scramble down to the pool, only a few yards below us, which was about fifty yards long by thirty broad, and apparently five or six feet deep. The temperature was 98\u00b0, and the taste of the water very strongly sulphurous. Then we ascended a mound be- hind, covered with ruins, consisting principally of fragments of columns, carved stone seats, and drafted blocks which had been used for building purposes. Immediately behind this mound was an extensive ruin, consisting of three arches in a fair state of preservation. Two of the arches were fif teen or twenty sect high, and enclosed a semicircular space"], [142, "128 HAIFA or hall for bathers. On the other side was a vaulted build ing which partly enclosed what is at this day the only fre quented spring. This is a circular pool. Part of the old masonry which enclosed it still remains. The pool is about twenty-five feet wide, with a temperature so high that I found it impossible to keep my hand in it. To my great astonish ment, and to theirs also when they saw me suddenly appear, four or five Arabs were bathing in it. How their bodies could support the heat was to me a mystery. They did not support it long. They were no sooner in than out, their bodies looking as much like lobsters as the complexion of their skins would permit. They laughed, and invited me to join them. One or two were stretched full length on the identical stone slabs under the building on which, doubtless, two thousand years ago, the bathers of that date used to re pose after having been half boiled alive. This spring must be of immense volume, to judge by the size of the torrent which gushed from it, and which was crossed on stepping-stones, flowing away in what would be considered a good-sized trout stream, to mingle its waters with the Yarmuk after a course of a few hundred yards. We determined, when our tents arrived, to pitch them near this spring, on the brink of another stream which flowed in from the eastward, and which, though slightly sulphu rous, was drinkable. Indeed, we did not object to taking a moderate amount of this wholesome medicament into our organisms. We found another strong spring, not quite so hot as the one in use, a little above our tents, so that there is no lack of water. Indeed, I doubt whether sulphur springs of so much volume exist anywhere else in the world. Not far from this, with its back to another mound, were the ruins of an old Roman theatre, some of the rows of seats still clearly discernible. These springs are situated on a plain about a mile long and half a mile broad, semicircular in shape, the chord of the arc consisting of a line of basalt precipices, from which it slopes gradually to the river, which forms the bow. It is watered by a good fresh-water spring, which rushes from the base of the cliffs. The hot sulphur stream which issues from the pool we first visited turns a mill and then flows into"], [143, "A VISIT TO THE SULPHUR SPRINGS OF AMATHA. 129 the long, oblong pond I first saw from above. Here, after the exertions of the day, I determined to bathe. I never enjoyed a swim more than the one in this soft sulphur water, with a temperature of 95\u00b0. The pool was about one hundred yards long and ten wide, and out of my depth nearly through out its length. The rocks, upon which I could sit comfort ably up to my neck, where the stream entered the pool were covered with a heavy white deposit. The sensation after wards was one of delicious languor; but my full enjoyment of the bath was a little marred by the fact that I had to walk a quarter of a mile back to the tents afterwards. I had a long talk on my way, to the miller, the solitary resident of this lonely but enchanting spot, and tried to induce him to desert the mill, of which he was the guardian, and act as my guide up the river on the following day; but he was either too conscientious, too lazy, or too ignorant \u2014 I suspiect the latter, as I found by experience that all the information he gave me of a tdpographical nature was utterly erroneous. It was, therefore, with a pleasing sense of anticipation that we retired to rest, determined to trust to our own geographi cal instincts alone for our proposed exploration. 0"], [144, "EXPLORATION OF THE VALLEY OF THE YARMUK. Haifa, April 30. \u2014 In my last letter I described the little known hot sulphur springs of Amatha, with their extensive ruins, which indicate the celebrity they must have acquired in the days of the Romans. As the river Yarmuk above this point had, so far as I know, never been explored, I deter mined to push up the gorges through which it cleaves its way from the highlands of the Hauran to the valley of the Jordan. Some years ago I had crossed it about thirty miles higher up, where it flows across a plateau at an elevation of 1800 feet above the sea. I was now standing on its margin, 550 feet below the sea. In the course of this thirty miles, there fore, it has a fall of 2350 feet. In other words, it was a fair presumption that there was a waterfall somewhere between those two points which had never been visited. The inquiries which I made from the natives on the point were unsatis factory in their result. They seemed unable to discriminate between a rapid and a waterfall, and although they told me of many places where the water rushed with great violence, they seemed to know of none where it was precipitous. Upon one point they were, unfortunately, all agreed, which was that there was no path up the river-side, and that it would be found impossible at this time of year, when the stream was flooded, to force a way up. However, we determined to try. We thought we should be more free in our move ments if we were unhampered by a guide, and directed only by our topographical instincts. We therefore left our tents standing, as a sort of home on which to retreat in case of need, and struck across the small plain upon which the springs are situated, to a ford, which four days previously had been impracticable, but which we"], [145, "EXPLORATION OF THE VALLEY OF THE YARMUK. 131 were assured we might now risk with safety. The stream was here a hundred yards broad, full of large rocks, and with a swift, turbid current that was by no means reassur ing. The water came high up on our saddle-flaps, but we reached the other bank without mishap, and found ourselves skirting a dense thicket of tropical underwood, above which a grove of at least three hundred date-trees reared their tufted crests. It was a spot unlike any other to be found in Palestine, for, although the heat in the valley of the Jordan, owing to its depression below the sea, is as great as this, and at its southern extremity greater, nowhere throughout its length is to be found a spot where the vegetation is so dense and luxuriant. Here were wild orange, lemon, fig, almond, and mulberry trees, oleanders growing to a gigantic size, besides butm, sidr, carob, and other trees peculiar to the country, and thickets of cane twenty feet high, forming a splendid cover for the wild boars with which we were as sured this jungle abounds. The Arabs come here at certain seasons to gather the dates, weave mats from the reeds, and harvest the crops of the slopes behind, which were now all waving with young grain. During that time they live in mud hovels, partly ex cavated in the ground, which were now deserted. There was only one inhabitant, and he ran a small mill, pictu resquely situated under some date-trees, which was turned by a stream of hot sulphur water issuing from a copious spring, with a temperature of 112\u00b0. The Yarmuk, which flows beneath a cliff of black basalt three hundred feet high, half encircles this unique spot, and I regretted that I had not time to explore it thoroughly; but the jungle was so im penetrable that it was impossible to make any impression upon it without an axe, and then it would have been a work of time. We now followed a track which approached the river bank. The hills, fortunately, on our side sloped back grad ually. Midway up the sheer face of the cliff opposite we saw here and there caves, which, from their regular shape, appear at one time to have been inhabited, but if so, the only approach could have been from above, by baskets lowered to the mouths, similar to the method used by the"], [146, "HAIFA 132 robbers who inhabited the Wady Hamam, behind the plain of Gennesareth, in days of old. Now, instead of robbers in baskets, we saw immense eagles sailing in front of the cliff, in the crevices of which they had placed their nests. Cross ing a spur which jutted into the river from the mountains on our right, and which prevented our following it closely, we obtained a splendid view of its course for some miles. To our left were basalt and limestone cliffs, and above them steep, sloping grass lands, now carpeted with wild flowers. Above them again were more crags and cliffs, and then the rim which marked the edge of the plateau, fifteen hun dred feet above us. To the right the hills sloped back more slowly, cleft here and there by wild, rocky valleys, while their summits were fringed with oak forests. Here and there the river foamed between precipices on both sides, and we began to perceive that the task of exploration was byr no means easy. But it was perhaps all the more interest ing. We made our horses scramble where only goats had been before, now along the base of the cliff over huge boul ders, now half-way up its precipitous side, when prudence suggested that horse and rider should separate, and each be responsible for his own life and limbs. Now we forced our way through tangled thickets of flowering shrubs that clung to the rocky sides where they were less steep, and now, ut terly baffled, diverging from the river and toiling up a steep grassy slope, only to slip and scramble down it again on the other side so as to regain the margin of the stream. Our progress was necessarily slow, not only owing to the natural obstacles we encountered, but to the fact that we were mapping the country as we advanced; but the scenery by which we were surrounded was too romantic to be hur ried over, and too interesting, from its novelty, not to be. carefully noted. At last we reached a point where there had been a land-slide, leaving bare one precipice a thousand feet high, while it formed another above the stream, which it had displaced. Nothing remained for it but to attempt another ford, and try our luck on the opposite bank. This, to the amazement of some Bedouins, who watched us from it and waved us back, we succeeded in accomplishing, not without a narrow escape on the part of one of our party who,"], [147, "EXPLORATION OF THE VALLEY OF THE YARMUK. 133 boldly leading the way, got entangled among the rocks and eddies. We were cordially welcomed by an Arab sheik, as we scrambled like half-drowned rats up the bank. He invited us to his tents, which were pitched a few hundred yards back from the stream, on a small plain. Here mats were spread for us, coffee roasted, pounded, and prepared, and, the young men gathering around, we proceeded, under the influence of an abundant distribution of cigarettes on my part, to exchange ideas. They told us they belonged to a village two and a half hours distant, and were therefore not nomads. They came hither at this season of the year to pasture their herds and look after their crops. I hardly like to report the con versation of these poor people as they came to confide their grievances to us, without our in any way inviting their con fidence. Suffice it to say that the recent measure of the government by which it has been decided to substitute for the dime, which has heretofore been the share of the gov ernment in the entire produce of every village, an assess ment based on the highest five years' average, has produced the greatest discontent among the rural population, whose poverty and distress, already extreme, owing to the extor tion of the tax-gatherers even under the old system, and the withdrawal of the bone and sinew of the country by con scription, especially during the recent Russo-Turkish war, will thus be intensified. In fact, these poor people were driven to such desperation that they were most unreserved in their language, and although they are the most long-suf fering and much-enduring of races, there is a point where the crushed worm will turn. However great the financial exigencies of the empire may be, they would better be met by a thorough reorganization and reform in the whole system of tax-collecting, than in adding to the burdens of the people, which are already greater than they can bear. Our hosts assured us that we should find any further at tempt to ascend the river impracticable, and that there was a place where the water fell for a considerable height, but we could only reach it by making a circuit, which would take a day. However, we determined to judge for ourselves, and succeeded in getting about a mile farther, when we found the river shut in by precipices on both sides. It was impossible"], [148, "134 HAIFA. to descend to it from the brow of the cliff on which we stood, much less to ford it afterwards, or to scramble up the preci pice on the other side. There was nothing for it but to make an ascent of at least fifteen hundred feet, either to the high plateau of Jaulan, on the right, or to recross the river where we had already forded it, and scramble up the steep, wood ed hillsides of Ajlun until we could find a path leading in the desired direction. This latter course we determined to adopt; so we returned to the Arab tents, crossed the river more successfully than before, warned by our previous ex perience, and braced ourselves for a twelve -hundred-feet climb up the best track we could find, under the guidance of one of our recent Arab acquaintances. I had been on the lookout all through the day for ruins, and I was now cheered by the intelligence that I should find some on the summit of the hill we were climbing. Such proved to be the case. The situation, at an elevation by my aneroid of about eleven hundred feet above the sea, would indicate that in old time it was a fortress. It was supplied with water by cisterns, the remains of which still exist, some of them demijohn shaped, and one about ten feet square and twenty feet to the bottom, which, however, was much filled up. There were many piles of huge blocks of drafted stone, but I did not observe any columns or carving, and I think the re mains date from a period anterior to the Roman occujjation. The modern name of the place is Tel el-Hosn, but its exist ence has heretofore been unknown, except to the Arabs of the neighborhood, and its discovery was some compensation to me for the effort I had made to reach it."], [149, "EXPLORATION ON THE YARMUK. Haifa, May 15. \u2014 From the ancient fortress of El-Hosn we crossed a spur to a high projecting point, from which we could look down a sheer precipice one thousand feet high, which had been formed by a land-slip, to the bed of the river. Forcing their way impetuously through a gorge opposite, the tributary waters of the Rukkad mingled their clear stream with the turbid Yarmuk, after a rapid course from their source in the highlands of Jaulan, from which ele vated plateau they are precipitated in a magnificent water fall eight hundred feet high. All this scenery is as yet ab solutely*- unknown and unexplored, this fall having only re cently been discovered, by my travelling companion on this occasion. I regretted being unable to visit it, but we were limited for time, and although it was only hidden from view by a projecting spur of the valley, so broken up is this country by precipitous ravines and gorges, that it would have taken us a day's hard riding to reach it. It was with regret that we found ourselves compelled to leave the elevated position on which we now stood, and which commanded an extensive view, limited in the extreme east by the lofty mountains of the Jebel Druze; and, steering our way by compass, struck a southeasterly direction, over a park-like, undulating country, covered with oak forest, with occasional patches of cultivation. This part of the country to the east of the Jordan, which is called the Kefe rat, is thinly inhabited, the villages being very small, squalid, and far apart, but it is a country all waiting to yield' of its abundance to some future race who may turn its magnificent resources to good account. In many places the trees were festooned with vines, the grapes of this dis trict being celebrated, but the population pay little heed to their cultivation, for it is impossible to protect them from"], [150, "HAIFA. 136 robbers. The Bedouins consider the sedentary inhabitants as lawful spoil, and raid over these lands at will, practically almost unchecked by the authorities, whose administrative hold on the country is of the slenderest description. It is, in fact, chiefly exercised at those times when it is necessary to send the mounted police into the villages to collect the taxes, and they clear up all that the Bedouins may have left, so that these poor peopile are engaged in a perpetual struggle to keep body and soul together, and although they are surrounded by a fertile country which, if it were prop erly cultivated, would make them wealthy, they only culti vate enough for their barest necessities, and have not the heart to attempt to accumulate wealth which they would not be permitted to keep. Situated at an elevation of about eighteen hundred feet above the sea, these high, wooded, fertile table-lands form a district which, should this coun try ever come to be occupied under more favourable con ditions than now exist, will certainly be among the first to attract an agricultural population. The wild, rocky gorges by which it is intersected render the task of exploration, without a guide, one attended with some uncertainty. We take our bearings by compass, gallop under the vine-trel lised trees, over green, level slopes, or along inviting glades, till we are suddenly brought up by a precipice down which it is impossible to scramble, which opens unexpectedly in a gulf at our feet. The spot we are making for is not half a mile distant, but we have to follow the edge of the gorge in the opposite direction. Then we come upon another at right angles, which forces us to double back still farther; so at last we wind round the head, first of one ravine and then of another, till we find two hours have elapsed since we were driven back on our tracks; the half-mile has now ex tended over five or six, the sun is declining with a rajiidity which seems accelerated because the daylight has become so precious to us that we cannot bear to anticipate the pros pect of its vanishing. At last we reach the head of the valley which has baffled us so long, and are compensated by discovering a ruin. Here are sarcophagi, rock tombs and cisterns, and carved fragments. Fortunately we come across a peasant, the only one we have seen since leaving the"], [151, "EXPLORATION ON THE YARMUK. 137 river, and he tells us that its name is Haleebna. We write it down and take its bearings as well as we can, for it is un known heretofore, but the day is too far spent for us to lin ger for minute examination. The peasant tells us that the best thing we can do, if we would get back to our tents, is to go down the valley we had intended to cross. We fol low his advice and have no reason to regret it. It is a Via Mala of grandeur and beauty, though on a small scale. We pass between curved limestone cliffs, the fissures in which are filled with underwood, the shrubs cling to the rocks, from which at one place gushes a copious stream of water, by the side of which we hurry with it down the valley, till we get back to the Yarmuk once more, and, wearied and ex hausted, reach our tents in the gathering darkness. Here we find a picturesque-looking Kurd waiting to receive us; he is an old soldier, and shows us the scars of five wounds \u2014 not all, however, received in military service, but for the most part in Arab skirmishes. He is the agent of the gov ernment in these parts, and also of the native capitalist who is the practical owner of the land, which is cultivated by an Arab tribe whose tents are pitched near us; they are heav ily indebted to the capitalist aforesaid, who allows them enough of the crops to keej) them from starving and takes all the rest himself. And our Kurdish visitor is his collec tor of revenue. He seems to have some difficulty in pro tecting his employer's interests, and tells us triumphantly that only a few nights before he has shot an Arab whoni he caught plundering. He says that during the bathing season as many as a hundred tents may be seen pitched round the sulphur springs of Amatha, and that their fame is so great that they are visited by invalids from Aleppo and Damascus. The fact, however, that Tiberias, which is five hours dis tant, is the nearest place in which supplies of any sort can be procured, and that the only accommodation to be ob tained is the patient's own tent, must operate as a serious obstacle to the use of these springs, about whose curative value, however, there can be no doubt. Our way from Amatha lay back across the Jordan valley, which at this season of the year is a sheet of waving grain, cultivated by a branch of the Beni Sukkr Arabs, whose"], [152, "HAIFA. 138 large encampment, with the handsome tent of the sheik in the centre, we pass without stopping, for we are in full pur suit at the moment of five gazelles, which scamper across country, giving us a good run, in which we should have cer tainly overtaken them had we not been checked by a ravine. We cross the Yarmuk at a point near its junction with the Jordan, and where it carries a volume of water certainly equal to that stream. The Jordan here falls in a fine rapid of about thirty feet in a distance of less than a hundred yards, and would furnish splendid water-power for mills in a part of the country which is much in want of them. The ancient Jisr el-Medjamieh spans the stream at this point, guarded by a government toll-house. Crossing it, we deter mined to try a short-cut up the little-known Wady Bireh, which is watered by a clear, purling brook, which, if it were utilized, would make this valley one of the most fertile and attractive in this part of the country. After following its winding course for some miles, we found it finally narrow ing into a crooked gorge, the sides of which approach so closely as scarcely to admit the passage of a loaded camel between the overhanging rocks. Indeed, when we after wards described our route to the natives they said it was never used by them. However, it gave us an opportunity of seeing some most romantic scenery, and by shortening the way enabled us to reach Nazareth, jaded and worn out, it is true, the same night."], [153, "A DRUSE RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL. Haifa, May 27. \u2014 Travellers who have gone from Naza reth to Tiberias must be familiar with the singular outline of a mountain which they perceive to the left of the road, with its two rocky crests separated from each other by a hog's back about a quarter of a mile long, and called the Horns of Ilattin. The summit of the higher peak, one thou sand feeo above the sea, and about three hundred feet above the plain across which they are riding, forms a conspicuous object in a landscape which, at this point, is one of singular interest and beauty. Rising like a gigantic natural pulpit, tradition has since declared it to be the Mount of the Beati tudes, and asserts that it was from this picturesque eleva tion that Christ delivered that sermon which has exercised so vast an influence on mankind ever since. Whether this be so or not, it is certain that the plain on which the audience was supposed to have gathered which listened to it, was the scene, about eleven hundred and fifty seven years afterwards, of the most memorable conflict in which the Crusaders ever engaged, for it was the one which lost them Palestine, and which resulted in the triumph of Saladin, the Saracen, and the slaughter or capture- of the most powerful and celebrated of the Crusading chiefs. At the extremity of the plain, and immediately beneath one of the horns of the mountain, there is a precipitous gorge, down which some of the hardly pressed Crusaders vainly attempted flight, the horses and their riders, heavily pano plied with armour, only escaping the spear of the Arab to meet an even more terrible fate, as they hurled themselves headlong down the rocky precipice. As, dismounting from my active steed, I allowed him to pick his own way down this dangerous defile, I looked with interest at the scene of the disaster, and listened to the story of my guide, who"], [154, "HAIFA 140 narrated how, only twenty years ago, a fight had taken place here between a celebrated Bedouin chief and a Kurd ish tribe, in which the latter were signally defeated on the old Crusading battle-ground, and, seeking safety, like the Christian warriors, in the direction of this treacherous gorge, left sixty dead men and horses at the bottom. These traditions and associations served to enhance the novelty and picturesqueness of the view before me as I en tered the gorge, for it was now the scene of a great gather ing of the sheiks and chiefs of the Druse nation, who come here annually on a pilgrimage to the shrine of one of their most celebrated saints, at which I was fortunate enough to be allowed to assist, a privilege which, so far as I am aware, had not before been granted to a foreigner. The building which forms this sacred resort has been erected by the Druses over the tomb of a certain holy man called Schaib, but exactly who Schaib was my utmost endeavours failed to discover. The Moslems say that he is Jethro, the father-in law of Moses; but when I asked the Druses whether Moses had married Schaib's daughter, they denied it. Then a Jew of the country, familiar with the Druses, suggested that Schaib was Balaam, but they refused altogether to admit that an ass had ever spoken to their holy man. He had crossed the Red Sea with Moses, they said, and after Moses' death had been ordered by God to bury him, and had done so, and had fought against a mighty king and prevailed against him, and had himself been buried here, and he was the Father of all Prophets and the elect of God, and there were none greater or more sacred than he. I thought pos sibly he might be Joshua, but him they knew by his own name, so I have given up the personality of Schaib as an in soluble mystery. He is one of those Druse characters whom their tradition has interwoven with Biblical history, but the tomb which they thus honour is undoubtedly considered by Moslems to be the tomb of Jethro, who is known among them as Schaib; and the Rabbi Bar Simeon, writing in 1210 a.d., mentions the tomb of Jethro as being at Hattin. Considering that Jethro lived in Midian, on the shores of the Red Sea, it seems rather unlikely that he should be bur ied here. However, that is a detail. The fact remains that"], [155, "A DRUSE RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL. 141 the spot is one of great sanctity, but is infinitely more ven erated by the Druses than by the Moslems. Indeed, I met a Moslem who laughed at the Druses' superstitions in re gard to it, and who was as much surprised and puzzled as I was when he heard them deny that Moses was the son-in law of the buried saint. The building which the Druses have erected over the old, dilapidated Moslem shrine, which still stands here, has al ready cost more than $5000, all subscribed by the Druses among themselves, and it is not yet completed. It consists of a courtyard, one side of which is formed by the solid rock, while the other contains chambers. The roof forms a terrace, and above it, also partly faced by rock, is a large upper chamber surmounted by a dome. The scene as we approached was very striking. The Druse sheiks, desirous of doing honour to their guest, formed in two lines to re ceive me, while guns were fired off and songs of welcome were sung. The white building, with its terraces crowded by men and women in bright -coloured garments, harmo nized well with the romantic character of the sceneiy, and formed a picture calculated to impress the imagination. I was ushered by my hosts into an anteroom, after ex- changing cordial greetings with those I knew, and being in- troduced to those who were still strangers to me; and then we all squatted on carpets, thus occupying all the four sides of the room, which assumed the appearance of a sort of council-chamber. As, with the exception of the Japanese, the Druses are the politest and most courteous people I have ever met, a great part of our time is taken up in salu- tations and compliments. First we press our hands to our hearts and lips and foreheads, with great effusion. No soon- er are we seated than we repeat this process as if we had not done it just before. Then, in flowery language, we ask each other repeatedly after our respective healths, and are profuse in our thanks to God that we are well, that they are well, that our families are well, and that we are permit- ted to enjoy the great privilege of meeting one another. Then coffee is brought in, and after drinking it we go through the same process of saluting each other all around. Then I request permission to light a cigarette, which is"], [156, "HAIFA. 142 necessary, as the Druses never indulge in tobacco; indeed, the more rigid eschew coffee. As I look around at the twenty or thirty sheiks, solemnly seated with their backs to the wall, I am much struck with the dignity of their bearing, the intelligence of their counte nances, and their superior physique generally. As a rule, there is a religious and a secular sheik to each village, so that about half my entertainers exercise spiritual functions, and half temporal. There was nothing, however, in their dress to distinguish them. They all wore white turbans, black or striped abbas, or wide-sleeved cloaks reaching to the knee, beneath which was the usual flowing garment of the Oriental, and their feet were bare. Many of the Druses, both men and women, have brown hair and blue eyes, and complexions as light as our own, and some of both sexes are singularly handsome. As all the sheiks had not yet assembled, we had not been long in conclave \u2014 indeed, had hardly exhausted our stock of compliments \u2014 before the singing of men and the firing of guns announced a distinguished arrival. Then we all went out to meet him, and I was interested in watching the meth od of greeting. I soon perceived that the forms of etiquette are most rigidly adhered to among them. When two of equal rank meet they clasp hands, and there appears a slight struggle \u2014 as they both bow their heads and lift their clasped hands towards their lips \u2014 as to who shall kiss the back of the other's hand first. This involves rather a curi ous twisting movement of the hands and heads, which pro duces a somewhat comical effect. Let any of my readers make the experiment, and, grasping each other's hands, try and kiss the respective backs of each without unclasping them, and the effort as to which shall succeed first makes quite a little game. My servant, who is a Moslem from Egypt, declared that they each kissed their own hands, and the argument waxed so hot between us that we had to refer the matter to a Druse to know which was right, so difficult was it to perceive exactly what really happened. If one felt himself inferior in rank to the other, he always succeed ed in kissing the other's haud first, and snatching his own away before the other had time to kiss it. But if the dis-"], [157, "A DRUSE RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL. 143 ference in rank was still more marked, the superior made no pretence of wanting to kiss the inferior's hand after his own had been kissed. Next came a great struggle as to who should take the lowest place. The place of honour was a particular corner, which, had I been better versed in their etiquette, I should have insisted on declining; but I innocently accepted it, and then the invariable struggle came as to who should be forced to sit next to me. I observed that in most instances the re fusals were of that formal kind which young ladies indulge iu when they have made up their minds to sing, but decline to do so until after they have been sufficiently pressed. I suppose there were envyings, jealousies, pride, and other base passions among my hosts as among other men, but if so they certainly concealed their failings with marvellous skill. One could not but be struck with the air of genuine harmony and affectionate cordiality which seemed to pre vail among them. The respect they showed to the head sheik of all, and the warm terms in which they spoke of him to me in private, could not but have been sincere, and, indeed, he seemed to deserve it. Though only a young man of about thirty-five, he inherited his honours, coming as he did of one of the most honourable Druse families; yet his distinguishing characteristic was a marked humility and consideration for others. His wife was certainly the most charming and lady like person I have yet seen among Druse women. She was not more than three or four and twenty, with a fair com plexion, magnificent eyes, and an elegant figure, a grace natural to her characterizing all her movements. Indeed, had she been dressed in the latest Parisian fashion, she would have been a strikingly attractive person in any society, nor would it have been possible by her features or complex ion to distinguish her from any pretty American woman. As it was, her dress was exceedingly becoming. On her head was a long white veil; a loose, tunic-shaped jacket, with full sleeves, covered an embroidered sort of chemisette, and her short, flowing skirts partially concealed full trousers, tight around the ankle. On her wrists were a pair of heavy gold bracelets, and she was the only woman of the party"], [158, "144 HAIFA who indulged in the luxury of shoes and stockings. The shoes, however, were always slipped off before entering a room. The Druse women of Galilee do not, like those of the Lebanon, cover their faces; and, indeed, they ai-e allowed a freedom which contrasts strongly with the position of their Moslem sisters. This wife of the head sheik enjoyed a privilege denied to any of the other women who had ac companied their lords to the shrine, for she frequently sat in the men's council, taking part in the conversation, though modestly, and with great reserve. In talking to me, which she did freely, I found that she was bright and intelligent, and full, of inquiries as to the manners and customs of the females of civilization, in regard to whom she had an intense curiosity. I do not know, however, whether, if it had been fully gratified, it would have tended very much to her moral and intellectual improvement. She had brought her baby with her, and was generally surrounded by some of the more prominent of the other ladies, who, however, treated her with a marked deference. I watched her mode of greet ing the different ladies as they arrived, with even more in terest than I had that of the men. We read in the Bible of people falling upon each other's necks; this was exactly what the Druse women did, and very prettily and gracefully they did it, while they recognized the men by a distant, modest, and deferential salutation."], [159, "THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DRUSES. Haifa, May 30. \u2014 Towards evening of the day on which I arrived at the great Druse shrine of Neby Schaib, near Hattin, most of the sheiks who were expected had arrived, with their retinues. It might have been a feudal gathering of olden time; the noisy welcome of the chiefs, the clans men singing war-songs and firing guns, the women follow ing on donkeys, all combined to make a scene which carried one back to the Middle Ages, and I never wearied looking at it. My tent was pitched on the lowest terrace of the sacred building, for it is not allowed to the unbeliever to pass the night within those holy precincts. Indeed, it was an un precedented privilege to be permitted even to camp on the terrace, where there was only just room for my tent, nor should I have been allowed \"to edge in so close to the mys teries of Druse worship had there been five square yards of level ground within a quarter of a mile. But the pre cipitous rocks frowned above us all around, and the com paratively open space below was crowded with camels, horses, and donkeys, comjselled to chum together, whether they liked it or not, and where the incessant din added to the general uproar of the place. The constant and stento rian braying of donkeys, varied occasionally by a horse fight, mingled with the barking of dogs, the shrill scream of welcome or ululation of women, the loud singing and clapping of hands of the dancing circles, and the firing of guns, all augured badly for a night's rest. However, there was no thought of going to bed yet; great piles of rice on which whole sheep had been skilfully dis sected were now borne in on round platters, each carried by two men. There must have been from three to four hun dred people now collected at the shrine, and the feeding of 10"], [160, "HAIFA. 146 such a multitude was no joke. Of these nearly half were women, all in gala dress, the favourite colours being blue, green, and red. I don't know that I ever remember in the pame number to have seen a larger proportion of pretty women. When I went up-stairs to the large vault which contains the tomb of the prophet I came upon them unexpectedly, all seated on the floor around the circular mats of parti coloured straw which they use as tablecloths. The room, which Was seventy feet long by forty wide, was crowded with this laughing, chattering, feeding, feminine multitude, with their glorious eyes, white, regular teeth, bewitching smiles, and delicate fingers plunged up to the knuckles into huge piles of greasy rice. Their invitation that I should come and take pot-luck with them produced a mixed senti ment in my breast. However, it was only said as a joke, for even had I desired I should not have been allowed to accept it. The entertainment was exclusively feminine, and I was surprised at so little reverence being shown to the venerated shrine by the close proximity of all this fes tivity. Taking off our shoes and picking our way between these festive groups, we reached, at Ihe other end of the hall, the tomb of the prophet, enclosed in a wooden screen hung with red cloth, while over the tomb itself was spread a sort of green silk pall, embroidered with gold stars. Some of the Druse sheiks who accompanied me reverently pressed their lips to this. They then pointed out a square block of limestone, in the centre of which was a piece of alabaster containing the imprint of a human foot of natural size. The toes are defined with more clearness than is usual in sacred footprints of this nature, and the Druses stooped and kissed the impression, assuring me that, if I would do so, I should feel that the rock exuded moisture, and that its pe culiarity was that it was never dry. I was constrained out of politeness to appear to accede to their wishes, though I refrained from testing the condition of the stone with my lips, as I felt suspicious, considering how many lips had pre ceded mine, that any little dampness I might discover might be easily accounted for otherwise than supernaturally."], [161, "THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DRUSES. 147 The question of footprints in the rock suggests some in teresting considerations. There are one or two others in different parts of Palestine, as in the mosque at Hebron, built over the Cave of Macpelah, and as they are artificial, it is probable that they are coronation stones. We know by tradition that in ancient times a custom of this sort ex isted in the British Isles, where footprints in rock exist, and there are Scriptural allusions which give colour to a similar hypothesis in Palestine. The pillar alluded to in the crown ing of kings was probably nothing more nor less than a coronation stone; and the habit which existed in some countries of making the king stand with his foot in the im pression of a print in the stone, as a sign that he would walk in the footsteps of his predecessor, may account for their occurrence in Palestine. Thus we read that Abime lech \" was made king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem;\" when Joash was anointed king by Jehoida, \" he stood by the pillar as the manner was,\" and the same king \" stood by a pillar to make a covenant, and all the peo ple stood to the covenant.\" The place of the footprint at Neby Schaib, in its elevated position above the copious foun tain which gushes from the base of the opposite cliff, and the remarkable cropping up of the alabaster through the rock, rendered it just such a spot as would be likely to be chosen for such a purpose, and I think we may fairly hazard the conjecture that the footprint at the Neby Schaib marks the coronation stone of the rulers in this part of the coun try in early Jewish, or perhaps even more ancient, times. It is far otherwise with the footprint of Buddha on Adam's Peak in Ceylon, and with that of Christ on the Mount of Olives, both of which I have seen, and both of which are natural, and bear onlyr a fancied resemblance to the human foot, that of Buddha being a depression in the rock about five feet long. In the case of the print under consideration, there was a split in the rock across the centre, which the Druses accounted for by saying that when the prophet stepped here he split the rock. Meanwhile the women, having finished their repast, now prepared for a dance on the terrace. The music consisted of singing, with a hand-clapping accompaniment, executed"], [162, "HAIFA 148 principally by the spectators, while the dancers formed in a circle, holding each other by the waistband, and rhyth mically swaying to and fro, as from time to time they changed the character and the measure of their step. All their movements were decorous, if not all actually graces ul. Sometimes one would separate herself from the ring, and, advancing to the centre, perform a pas seul, while the others danced around her, she the while flinging her hands aloft, waving in each a light muslin veil, and making it float above her head, while she kept time with her feet. But among the Druses, as among most Orientals, the hands play as prominent a part in their terpsichorean exercises as their feet. The eminently good looks of the dancers were set off by their becoming costumes. These consisted of outer cloaks of a rich colour, linen or woollen, open all down the front so as to display the whole underdress, with light sleeves cut above the elbow, the whole trimmed either with wide bands of reddish satin or with a rich cross-stitch embroidery of silk. The unsightliness of the baggy trousers of dark blue is lost under the long, semi-transparent chemise, which falls over them as a white tunic, generally striped with thicker white, and tastefully embroidered with silk around the neck. The white sleeves of the chemise, widely point ed, and which flow about the forearm after escaping from the short cloak sleeve, form a simple but very graceful feature of this costume, whether they float freely or are twisted, for convenience in work, about the elbow. Scarfs of various bright colours are wound below the waist, and the cloak is usually caught together below the bosom by a cord or button, giving that double girdle often present ed in ancient classical costume. The simple long, white cloth, with the centre of one edge drawn low upon the forehead, its two ends hanging down the back almost to the heels, bound fast by a wide fillet of brilliant colour tied around the head, completes very attractively, with its ancient Egyptian appearance, this simple but highly char acteristic dress, which is enhanced by necklaces and ban gles, according to the rank and position of the wearer. Our attention was now distracted by some rival perform ances of the male part of the community in the courtyard"], [163, "THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DRUSES. 149 below. Here the singing and clapping of hands were loud er and more vehement, and time was given by one gentle man who played a pipe and another who was a sort of band master, and directed the changes of time and step. Here the central figure who danced in the circle, instead of wav ing veils or handkerchiefs, flourished a sword with great grace and dexterity, slashing it about in excellent time to the music, and within an inch sometimes of the noses, some times of the legs, of the performers. The dancers worked themselves up at last to a high pitch of excitement and per spiration, new ones perpetually dashing into the ring and taking the places of those who were exhausted. At last the gayeties were put an end to by the sheiks, who took no part in them themselves, but looked on with solemn dignity. The \" okal,\" or initiated in the holy mys teries, despise all such frivolities, which are reserved for women and the uninitiated. Most of these had been sitting in a circle in a quiet part of the terrace by themselves, dis cussing either religion or the political questions affecting the interests of their nation, most probably the latter; but the hour had now arrived when the serious business of the night was to begin and festivity was to cease. The uproar died away, the elders wished us good - night, and silently trooped up the stone stairs to the great hall, whence issued the younger part of the female community, and I retired to the door of my tent to sit in the bright moonlight and con template the strange surroundings of my night quarters. Soon there broke upon the stillness of the night the meas ured cadence of a sacred chant. Now it swelled, as numer ous voices, male and female, took up the chorus; now it died away to a single voice. Never before, probably, had stranger been able to listen so closely to the prayers and in vocations which characterize the mysterious and occult worship of the Druse3. One thing surprised me, which I think is not generally known, and this is that women un doubtedly take part in some of their forms of worship, not, however, in all, for on the following night they were ex cluded, and the service was conducted by males alone. At last I went to bed, but not to sleep; the noises of the ani mals, to which I was in close proximity, for a long time ban-"], [164, "150 HAIFA. ished repose, and when at last it came fitfully, I heard ever and anon the rhythm of the sacred chant. Throughout two entire nights, to my certain knowledge, did these Druses pray and sing, though, as I fell asleep on each occasion towards morning, I cannot precisely sayr at what hour their service was concluded. There can be no doubt that, while these gatherings are essentially religious in their character, they are largely used for political purposes. In this respect a wonderful organi zation exists among the Druses. Although the nation may be said to be divided into three sections, of which one \u2014 by far the largest \u2014 occupies the mountains of the Hauran, known as the Jebel Druse, another the mountains of the Lebanon, and the third and smallest the hills of northern Galilee, they keep up a close contact with each other, and meetings such as these afford opportunities for them to hold counsel in regard to the political fortunes and condition of the nation. The Druses of the Jebel Druse, who form two thirds of the nation, have only this year made peace with the Turkish government, -with whom they were at war last year. The impracticable nature of the counts, combined with their own bravery, enables them to maintain a sort of quasi independence. They are free from the conscription, have a governor, or Caimakam, chosen from among them selves, and their taxes are little more than nominal. The Druses of the Lebanon come under the special statute re lating to the government of that province, and as this is subject to the supervision of the six European treaty pow ers, their position is secured, and they have no cause of grievance, though they are in close contact with their neigh bours, the Maronites, with whom they live on terms of con siderable tension. The Druses of Galilee differ in position from the other two sections of the nation, in that they en joy no privileges of any kind, but are, on the contrary, less fortunately placed in their relations to the government than either Moslems or Christians, the former being naturally, to a certain extent, favored by their government, and the lat ter being always able, in case of a grievance, to appeal to some Christian European power. These Druses are, how ever, absolutely without protection of any kind, and have"], [165, "THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DRUSES. 151 many grievances unredressed, and many acts of hostility on the part of the peasantry of other religions, among whom they live, to struggle against. The only consolation they enjoy is the support and comfort they derive from the close tribal family connection which they keep up with the other two more fortunate branches of the nation. It is easy to perceive, therefore, why they should attach great value to these religious gatherings, and utilize them for secular pur poses. There can be no doubt that the character of their re ligion, with the secrecy which surrounds it, enables them to organize in a special manner, and that the theocratic element which enters into their political constitution gives them a cohesion, a unity, and a power for combined action which the Christian sects, with their jealousies, bigotry, and in ternal dissensions, do not enjoy."], [166, "HATTIN AND IRBID. Haifa, June 22. \u2014 While my two days' experiences at the Neby Schaib, described in my last two letters, were in the highest degree novel and picturesque, and enabled me to obtain an unusual insight into the manners and customs and religious observances of the Druse nation, my stay at this celebrated shrine of their pilgrimage was by no means des titute of arch\u00e6ological interest. The village of Hattin, which is in the immediate neighbourhood of the tomb of the prophet, forms the centre of many sacred and historical associations, while it is in itself a place of unusual beauty of situation. In the overhanging rocks on the other side of the gorge, immediately opposite my tent, were several sepulchral chambers, all traditional burying-places of persons more or less historical. Some of these I examined. The largest was one entered by a doorway, which had recently been in habited, for the framework of a wooden door to it still re mained. It was supposed to be the burial-place of one of Jethro's daughters. We are told by Josephus that his fam ily followed the Israelites out of Midian. Its last occupant was an Indian hermit, who had lived here in solitude for three years, when, getting tired of his seclusion, he had gone to Tiberias about a year ago, married there, and im mediately disappeared with his wife, no one knew whither. About a hundred yards from the Neby there issues from the mouth of the gorge a copious spring which, in fact, forms the source of a brook, that ultimately finds its way into the Sea of Galilee. It commences its beneficent course, however, by fertilizing a large area immediately surround ing the village, where flourishing gardens of oranges, lemons, figs, apricots, pomegranates, and other fruit-trees impart an air of luxuriant fertility to the landscape not common in"], [167, "HATTIN AND IRBID. 153 these parts. Among these gardens is one which was pur chased a few years ago by Sir Moses Montefiore, and pre sented by him to the Jews of Tiberias. Here I went, at the invitation of the overseer, and, seated on mats under the spreading arms of a fig-tree, I listened, while I sipped his coffee, to his tale of woe: how last year he had resisted what he considered an exorbitant charge for taxes, how his gar den had in consequence been invaded and despoiled by the tax-gatherers; how, being a British-protected subject, and the garden being the property of British subjects, he had appealed to the British consul for redress; how he had spent \u00a350 in the effort to obtain it, and had found British protection not only a broken, but an expensive reed to trust to; and how he was driven, by the refusal of the British government to protect its subjects, to try and protect him self by the plentiful expenditure of backsheesh. I explained to him that it was not the habit of the British government to protect its subjects, but rather to abandon them, even though they might be of exalted rank, and their lives might be at stake; and then I went in search of ruins. I found some immediately adjoining the garden. What had evidently once formed part of an old Byzantine church was here turned into a mosque; and upon one of the stones was a curious Cufic inscription. In some of the other gar dens were traces of foundations, indicating that in old times Hattin must have been the site of a considerable town. It is about two miles from the ruins of Irbid (which is no doubt the Arbela of Josephus), and is probably the Caphar Hittia of the Talmud, but I find no mention of the Hattin ruins in the memoirs of the Palestine Exploration Fund, nor of the Cufic inscription which I found. The way to Ir bid lies across the plain, on which a collection of seven basalt stones in a ring are called the \" Hajaret en Nusara,\" or \" stones of the Christians,\" because tradition has it that it was here that Christ performed the miracle of the seven loaves and two fishes. The plain was now waving with grain, nor would it be possible to imagine a more fertile or luxuriant upland. On its margin, where it breaks off abruptly into the marvellous gorge of El-Hamam, with its precipitous sides rising twelve"], [168, "154 HAIFA hundred feet sheer up from the little stream which trickles at their base, are the ruins of Irbid, interesting as contain ing the remains of the oldest Jewish synagogue probably to be found in Palestine. The steep hillside which slopes down to the edge of the cliff is very rocky, and numerous sarcophagi are carved on the surfaces of the natural slabs. The largest measure from six feet to six feet five inches long, and one foot ten inches deep, being round at the head and square at the foot, which is slightly deeper. There was a ledge cut round to receive the stone cover, and a channel made to keep the surface water from running in. They were of all sizes, some, evi dently, for small children and babies. But the most remark able tomb was one which opened out of a deep, rock-cut chamber, which appeared to have been in connection with a wine-press. The antechamber formed a sunk court, about twenty feet by ten, and contained a sarcophagus. It opened into a tomb containing six loculi. My guide was the Jew who had entertained me in the garden, and who was well versed in local traditions. He informed me that here were supposed to be buried four of the sons of Jacob, he did not know which, and Jo chabed and Dinah. He also pointed out to me the tomb of the Rabbi Nitai, who was supposed to have built the syna gogue I had been examining, and who was a native of the place, and lived about two hundred years B.C.; also a mound of stones covering apparently a rock tomb, which he de clared was the burial-place of Seth, the son of Adam; but, although from much habit I am accustomed to swallow a fair amount of traditional information, I was unable to push my credulity thus far. It is described, however, by the Rabbi Gerson, a.d. 1561, as being in a cave with a spring to which a flight of steps led down. The tombs of Zerah and Zephaniah were also pointed out. Indeed, there are few places in Palestine where in the same limited area such a number of distinguished personages of sacred history are buried as in the neighbourhood of Arbela, or Irbid. I do not now include the tombs of the numerous rabbis whom the Jews hold sacred. If it has a character for sanctity, it must at one time have had a reputation for strength. From"], [169, "HATTIN AND IRBID. 155 its position it must always have been a military stronghold. Josephus tells us, in his \"Life,\" that when be was Governor of Galilee he fortified it, and laid up stores of grain here; and it is without doubt the Casale Ardelle of the Teutonic knights (1250 a.d.), the d being an error for b, as it is men tioned in connection with Tiberias and Beisan, both places not very distant. The only Biblical reference to this place is that made by Hosea, when he says, \" Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people; all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shahnan spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle.\" As we stand here we can almost look into the caverns with which the face of the opposite cliff is perforated, while the one on the edge of which we stand is literally honeycombed with these subter ranean abodes. They are of immense extent, and are placed over each other in different stories; some are walled up, leaving doors and windows. Some idea of the extent of this singular natural fastness may be formed from the fact that it is capable of containing six thousand men. The caves communicate with each other by subterranean gal leries. These are the fortified caverns mentioned by Jose phus in connection with Arbela. Bachides, the general of Demetrius, the third King of Syria, when he invaded Pales tine, encamped at Arbela and subdued those who had taken refuge in the caves. This event is narrated in Maccabees, where the caves are called \"stories.\" It was here, also, that Herod the Great had his famous fight with the robbers who had made their dens in the caves, letting down his sol diers in baskets, and fighting them in mid-air. I was determined to push my explorations to the summits of the rocky crests which frowned above, and are called the Horns of Hattin. Scrambling up the steep, rocky hillsides, we found ourselves at last obliged to leave our horses and make our way on foot over the huge blocks of basalt which are thickly strewn around these singular peaks. On reach ing the top we found that they had been artificially super imposed one on the top, of another, so as to form a rocky rampart of immense solidity. Both crests had, at some pe riod of remote antiquity, been thus fortified. Beneath one of them were the foundations and ruins of an ancient town"], [170, "156 HAIFA. which the inhabitants call \" Medinet el-Inweileb,\" or \" the ruins of the long tower.\" At the southeast of the hill is an oblong cavern cut in the rock and cased with cement, which may formerly have been a cistern; and not far from it are the foundations of a building which the natives say was a Christian church before the conquest of the country by the Mohammedans, who subsequently converted it into a mosque. Nothing could be more striking than the view from the summit of the highest horn. Immediately beneath us, some six or seven hundred feet below, I looked down into the gloomy gorge, with the white walls of the Neby Schaib contrasting with the black basalt rocks, its terraces covered with groups of brightly costumed Druses, their songs as they danced in circles reaching us on the still air of evening, and beyond, the modern village of Hattin, sur rounded by orange- groves and fruit - gardens of the most brilliant green. Stretching away on all other sides were vast uplands of waving grain, till they either sunk away into valleys or terminated at the base of hills which rose abrupt ly above them. To the northeast the precipitous sides of the Wady Hamam, honeycombed with caves, formed a vista through which appeared in the distance a green strip of the plain of Genesareth ; beyond it the waters of the Sea of Galilee, seventeen hundred feet below us, gleamed in the setting sun. From its eastern margin rose the steep cliffs above which is the vast plateau of Jaulan, once the grazing lands of the flocks and herds of Job, while a line of conical volcanic peaks, backed by snow-clad Hermon, closed the prospect."], [171, "THE JEWISH FEAST OF THE BURNING AT TIBERIAS. Haifa, July 8. \u2014 In the early days of May there is annu ally celebrated at Tiberias a festival in honour of the Rabbi Mair, at the large shrine built above his tomb, within a few hundred yards from the sulphur baths. Thither, having terminated my visit to the Druses, I determined to repair to Avitness the nocturnal ceremonies. I Avas escorted to the extremity of the A-illage of Hattin by a band of young Druses, firing guns and singing compli mentary odes, who thus sought to speed with honour the parting guest, and soon found myself crossing the plain and entering upon the steep descent that leads to the shores of the lake. It was a soft, balmy evening, about sunset, when I reached Tiberias, and found the Avhole population in move ment. The distance from the town to the tomb of the rabbi is about a mile and a half along the lake shore, and the road Avas croAvded with merry groups of Jewish men, Avomen, and children in gala dress, all flocking to the place of meet ing. The two or three boats of which the lake can boast Avere even put into requisition, and were slowly drifting down, their large sails hardly filled with the gentle breeze, and packed to overfloAving Avith Avomen and children. Ti berias contains between three and four thousand JeAvs, and certainly more than half that number must have turned out, to say nothing of those attracted from Jerusalem, Safed, and other places. As those who inhabit Tiberias are near ly all Sephardim, or Spanish Jews, the men wear the Oriental dress, Avhile the Avomen indulge in -a costume in Avhich the Western fashions seem grafted on those of the East. The visitors, who were for the most part Ashkenazim, or German Jcavs, could easily be distinguished, as they always appear"], [172, "HAIFA 158 in the clothes to Avhich they are accustomed in eastern Eu rope. It must be confessed that the flowing robe of Asia. is preferable to the long coat or gabardine of Russia and Roumania. The men usually walked, but a favourite method of locomo tion among the women Avas donkeyback, and very comical they looked, sitting astride very wide pads, with their skirts well up to their knees, and their necks and wrists and fore heads bedizened with ornaments, while their wigs were of ten a perfect garden of flowers. However pretty some of the faces of the younger members of the female community might be \u2014 and they could not compare for good looks Avith the Druse girls \u2014 nothing can compensate for the abomina ble practice which prevails among them of shaving their heads and wearing wigs of black hair, Avhich come Ioav down upon the forehead, and the falseness of which no attempt is made to disguise. It occurred to me upon this occasion, as I contrasted their chevelure with that of the \"Druses, to speculate on the cus tom of Druse hairdressing, which is nothing more nor less than that square cutting across the forehead of locks drawn over it Avhich has been so much in Arogue in England and America for the last fifteen years, popularly called \"bang ing,\" and which was supposed at first to be copied from the well-known picture of Raphael as a child. I have since in quired of some fashionable young Syrian ladies, and the younger ones assured me at first that the Druses must have copied this from the Parisian fashions lately introduced at Beyrout \u2014 an obvious impossibility. On applying to older ladies, however, they confirm the curious fact that this bang ing has always been a custom with the Druse people. The fine ladies of the present generation have little guessed whom they were imitating in setting saucers upon their own heads and those of their little ones, and snipping their hair around them just above their eyes. Nothing could exceed in vulgarity the tinsel ornamentation of the Jewish head dresses, and, to increase the effect, various pigments were apparently used by many of the ladies to improA-e their com plexions. As this festival takes place in the height of the bathing"], [173, "THE JEWISH FEAST OF THE BURNING AT TIBERIAS. 159 season, the shore of the lake at this point presented an ap pearance of unwonted animation. There were some thirty or forty tents pitched round the bath-house, which an enter prising Syrian has leased this year from the government, and whitewashed; he even Avent so far as to offer to build a carriage-road at his own expense for the mile and a half which it is distant from the town, so as to accommodate pa tients who had no tents of their own; but this was the thin edge of a wedge of civilization at Avhich the authorities took alarm, and he Avas sternly forbidden to spend any of his own money for the public conA-enience in the manner pro posed. The result is that the bathers are all obliged to live in tents or mat huts, which are unbearably hot during the day, or ride from the town and back again for every bath. Patients from all the neighbouring parts of Syria noAV mingled with the JeAvish crowd, and streamed up the short ascent which leads to the tomb, the terrace of which was already thronged. Passing through an archway, I entered a courtyard where the usual circular dance was in progress, the performers being exclusively male. The bedizened fe males sat in groups, feasting on good things they had brought with them, and smoking narghiles. Their small children were tricked out gaudily, and by the light of nu merous flaring lamps the general effect was quaint and gay enough. Ascending from this scene of revelry up a massive stone stair, I entered a chamber Avhere the tomb of the rabbi Avas surrounded by a wooden enclosure, inside of which were sundry rabbis and their neophytes praying, Avith the swaying motion of the body peculiar to that act of worship, the whole brilliantly lighted with lamps. There was in the centre of this chamber, which was croAvded, an immense chandelier, of Avhich only a few lamps were lighted, and beyond it I was ushered by a JeAV, who A-olunteered to be my guide, into another room, stifling hot, in which sat the chief rabbi himself. Here a man was perpetually shouting in a stentorian voice something which I failed to under stand. The chief rabbi, howeA'er, to whom I was introduced, explained to me that he Avas at that moment selling by auc tion the privilege of lighting the bonfires which were soon"], [174, "160 HAIFA. to blaze in honour of the deceased rabbi and Simon Ben Jochai, who, however, seems to be buried elseAvhere. This privilege was put up at tAvo napoleons each, and the first finally went for three, a fact Avhich the rabbi announced to the audience in a sonorous Hebrew chant. Then the other lighting privilege was bought for a little less, the money, according to my informant, being given to the poor. Af ter that a dozen more sales were made, simply for lamp lighting, the amounts bid averaging half a napoleon. Then a sort of procession Avas formed, and the crowd surged out down the steps to the courtyard, in the centre of which were two columns, each surmounted by a sort of large saucer. The excitement now became great, the danc ing stopped, and men and women joined in noisy acclama tions. A man bearing aloft an iron cradle full of flaming rags, which had been lighted by the highest bidder, placed them in the saucer at the top of the column and poured a bottle of kerosene oil upon it. People now came fonvard with offerings to be burned. These consisted, for the most part, so far as I could judge, of old handkerchiefs and scarfs. The theory is that they should be articles of value, covered Avith gold and silver embroidery, and that, after they have been committed to the flames, the residue of gold and silver which remains should be scraped up and given to the poor; but I doubt whether the residue of the rags Avhich I saw would amount in value to ten cents. Then the second bon fire was lighted, and as both piles blazed up and shed their lurid glow over the eager faces of swarthy men, with their long ear-curls, and bedizened women, the scene was in the highest degree novel and picturesque. The proceedings were not, however, characterized by the gravity and har mony befitting the occasion. As I looked down upon the crowd from the steps upon Avhich I was standing, I observed suddenly a violent commo tion, which soon culminated in blows and sharp cries, and the crowd began to surge violently to and fro. I failed to discover the cause of the disturbance, but it Avas speedily interrupted by a strong body of Turkish police, who rushed in brandishing their muskets and laying about them with the butt ends. The riot speedily subsided under this op-"], [175, "THE JEWISH FEAST OF THE BURNING AT TIBERIAS. 161 portune display of energy, and the ringleaders were hustled off with commendable promptness. Meantime a someAvhat similar ceremony Avas taking place in the adjoining courtyard, where some Avicker lamps wero being lighted. The pilgrims Avhio filled this court were Ashkenazim, and in their more European clothes they were by no means so picturesque a crowd. It is a singular fact that the Sephardim should be confined to one court and the Ashkenazim to another. There is, indeed, very little sym pathy between the tAvo great branches of the JeAvish race in Palestine. They live for the most part in different cities, and have but little intercourse with each other. Thus, near ly all the Jews in Tiberias are Sephardim, Avhile those at Safed are Ashkenazim. The ceremonies which I have just described are a mild edition of Avhat was to take place on a far larger and more important scale at Meron a Aveek later, but as these latter differ in no important respect from those Avhich I witnessed, I did not think it worth Avhile to stay for them. Jews como from great distances to take part in the burnings at Meron, where a great number of bonfires are made in honour of the numerous celebrated rabbis avIio are buried in the neighbour hood; and here I Avas assured that articles of great value are consumed, and the festivities are of a much more noisy character, and last through the whole night instead of wind ing up before midnight, as was the case at Tiberias. I did not even prolong my stay till this hour, satisfied Avith hav ing assisted at ceremonies Avhich prove that the Jewish ia not exempt from that tendency which characterizes all other religions, of pandering to the grosser tastes of the masses. 11"], [176, "HOUSE -BUILDLNG ON CARMEL. Daliet- el -Carmel, July 12. \u2014 Those readers who may have read my letters from Palestine, may remember that last year I took refuge from the summer heats at the vil lage of Esfia, on the highest point of Mount Carmel, Avhere I established a temporary camp. The disadvantage of liv ing under canvas is that, though it may secure you cool nights, it affords but insufficient shelter from the noonday sun. I therefore determined to build myself something more substantial. My experiences of house -building on Carmel have been both characteristic and instructive. When I announced my intention to the villagers of Esfia, they professed the greatest enthusiasm, and the owners of the land which I had chosen for a site expressed their de sire to make me a present of it, so anxious did they pretend to be that I should settle among them. I absolutely refused, however, to receive anything as a gift, and told them to name their price. This they modestly put at $650. As the most trustworthy estimate I could obtain put its value at $50, I said I would reconsider my original decision and ac cept it as a gift. This seemed to afford them intense amuse ment. Offers of this sort were merely complimentary7, they said, and meant nothing. I replied that the joke of offer ing me the land for nothing Avas only equalled by their asking me twelve times its value, Avhich I should also con sider meant nothing. They came down at a bound to $250, provided I would pay the costs of the transfer. This I found to mean procuring them a valid title to the land, Avhich they admitted they had not got, and Avhich it would cost $50, expended in bribes to the government, to obtain. I suggested that I might in that case expend the $50 in pro curing a valid title from the government in my own name, and pay them nothing, seeing that, though theoretically,"], [177, "HOUSEBUILDING ON CARMEL. 163 they were not practically, the OAvners of the land. This, though it might possibly have been accomplished, would have placed me in open Avarfare with the village. Rather than live there under such conditions, I declined to have anything more to do with people who had shown such dis honest and grasping propensities. I will say, however, that these were confined exclusively to the Christian section of the population, who claimed the OA\\rnership of the site, and that the Druses held themselves aloof and repudiated all participation in the negotiations, expressing great indigna tion at the conduct of the Christians, and offering me sites elsewhere. I was too disgusted with these latter, however, to be tempted to live near them, and was casting about in despair for an alternative, when one day I received a visit from the Druse sheik of Dalieh, the only other village on Carmel, and distant about thirteen miles from Haifa, who arrived in great distress to tell me that his only son had just been drawn as a conscript for the army, and that the whole fam ily, including his son's Avife, whom I had remarked on the occasion of a former visit as one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen, were thrown into the greatest grief, as they were unable to pay the $250 which was required to buy a substitute. I rode up to the village to inquire into the matter, and, in return for the required sum, which I paid, received a vineyard and garden of fruit-trees, with a good title, and a site far surpassing in loveliness of situation that Avhich I had failed to secure at Esfia. The whole village turned out en masse to expi-ess their gratitude and make professions of service. As the village is exclusively Druse, and does not contain a single Christian inhabitant, I felt that these were to be relied upon; nor, so far, has this con fidence turned out misplaced. The sheik to whom I had thus been able opportunely to render assistance, was the spiritual head of the village. Its temporal affairs are man aged by another sheik. The site for my house Avas only di vided by a terrace from the little Druse place of worship, where, however, the services are conducted under the strict est secrecy. The whole hillside here is terraced Avith vines, pomegranates, and wide-spreading fig-trees, at an altitude"], [178, "HAIFA 164 of thirteen hundred feet above the sea, which is distant as the crow flies about five miles. It commands a magnificent view of it and of the picturesque ruin of Athlit on its pro jecting promontory, Avhile a smiling A-alley, the sloping hills of Avhich are partially cultivated and partially covered with copse-wood, Avinds doAvn to a wild gorge between whose pre cipitous cliffs one enters the plain of Sharon. The difficulty in placing the house was to do so without having to cut down any of the fig-trees that formed a sort of bower in which Ave had to nestle, and Avhich secures us abundant thick shade. No sooner did Ave begin to excavate for the foundations than we came upon huge, massive cut blocks of stone, which evidenced the existence of some pre vious building of great antiquity. Soon there turned up a beautifully carved cornice, then a coin of one of the Con stantines of the period of the Byzantine Empire, then about a dozen iron rings about tAvo and a half inches in diameter, attached to iron staples, and a quantity of nails about four inches long, all heavily encrusted with rust. These were dug up about two feet beneath the surface. Then came handles of jars and fragments of pottery, some pieces of old glass, one apparently the stem of a vase, and quantities of tesser\u00e6, showing the existence of a tessellated pavement someAvhere beneath. I was sorely tempted to diverge from building into excavating, but I should have destroyed my site, indefinitely postponed the erection of the house when time Avas of the utmost value, and forfeited my contract with the builder. So I have had to do the barbarous thing of building on the top of what may be a most interesting ruin, and of actually using the old foundations and some of the stone which composed this house of the ancients. The most of the stones of which the house is built come however, from the ruins of Dubil, the extensive remains of which are about a mile distant. Here is the finest collection of rock-cut tombs on Carmel; Avhile the number and size of the cisterns, the huge circular stones of the old olive-press es, the basins carved in the solid rock as wine vats, the fragments of columns, and the area over which the solid foundations of the former town extend, prove that it con tained, in the most ancient times, a larger population than"], [179, "HOUSE-BUILDING ON CARMEL. 165 any other spot on the mountain. I am able to say this Avith the more confidence as I have visited over twenty other sites of ancient towns on Carmel. From this almost inex haustible quarry of old dwellings is my new one mainly con structed, and thus do I live and move and have my being amid the relics of a most remote past. One of the most puzzling of these is an immense roller, Avhich I came upon in making a terrace for the veranda, from which it now projects as a conspicuous ornament. It is eight feet long, but one end has been a good deal broken, and it may haAye been longer. It tapers very slightly at both extremities, and is nine feet in circumference around the centre, the ends being about tAvo feet six in diameter. It has four parallel lines of slots a little over two feet apart, each slot about eight inches long and three deep, and two wide at the top. There are four of these slots in each line, and they are about eight inches apart. The whole mass weighs probably from three to four tons. We had quite a force of men to moAre it into its present position. I leave it to the Avise in such matters to conjecture what its possible use may have been. I have seen others scattered about in some of the ruins on the mountain, generally near olive presses. I think they had some reference to the crushing apparatus. But by far the most important find \u2014 and this Avas not made until after the house Avas finished and we were clear ing up the debris \u2014 was an ancient cistern; and, as luck Avould have it, it was just in the position in which I would haAre put a cistern had this not appeared ready to haud, thus saving me an expenditure of about $200. The aper ture, cut in the solid rock, is tAvo feet three inches square. It is then hollowed, demijohn shape, out of the rock to a depth of fourteen feet, with an average breadth at the bot tom of tAvelve feet. In the bottom is a circular hole five feet in diameter by three deep. This is evidently for clean ing out the cistern, and is a good idea, Avhich I should sug gest be adopted by us moderns. It is plain that if, instead of haA'ing a flat bottom to a cistern, you have a hole in the bottom into which you can sweep all the dirt, the process of cleaning is simplified. It took four men several days to"], [180, "166 HAIFA. clean out this old cistern. It contained a great quantity of fine mould, some broken earthenware jars, a good many large stones, and a rather good fragment of a glass cup. The old cement is still visible, about half an inch thick. Besides the cistern, I have found a cave, formerly a tomb, close to the house, Avhich I shall use as a cellar, and store away my wine in the stone coffins, or loculi, in which the bones of some ancient characters have reposed. From all which it Avill appear that house-building in Palestine, if it is attended with the inconA-eniences arising from the back ward state of civilization, may nevertheless possess a charm of its own. If some of our appliances are rough-and-ready, they of ten possess the merit of cheapness. Plastering, for instance, is an expensive luxury; but the natives have a Avay of plas tering the walls which is nearly as good, and by no means costly. This is entirely done by the women, who come and sift soil, Avhich they mix with cut straw and water, and knead into a paste. When they have plastered the walls and floor with this, they make another Avith a peculiar, fine Avhite clay, which they dig from certain places in the hill sides, and, mixing this also with finely chopped straAv, lay it on as an outer covering. It makes a ATery pale yellow coat ing for the walls, which is by no means unsightly. It is not so good, however, for the floors, as it is said to giA-e a better harbour for fleas than another and more expensive cement Avhich is made with lime, and is called barbarica. This is better also for the flat roofs, as it is more impervious to Avater in the rainy season. These roofs enable us to double our accommodations in a most economical fashion. For instance, Ave have a guest coming, and if the house is full, we build him a leaf hut on the roof at the extravagant rate of 75 cents. These charm ing little leaf huts, which can be made most snug and com fortable when lined with mats, can be multiplied at Avill over the Avhole roof, and the occupants have a cooler time and a more extensive vieAV than the dwellers in the stone chambers beneath. As, however, in these climates air and room add materially to comfort, our principal living-room is thirty feet by twenty, and fifteen feet high, though I have"], [181, "HOUSE-BUILDING ON CARMEL. 167 not aspired to anything but a summer cottage, and the whole cost has not exceeded $800. In the eyes of the natives, this modest erection has seemed something palatial. The people of Esfia have come over, green with envy of their Dalieh rivals, and bitterly reproaching themselves Avith the short-sighted cupidity which has deprived them of the prestige Avhich now attaches to Dalieh, and filled with regret at the loss of the money which would otherwise have been spent among them, Avhile to the Dalieh villagers it is a source of pride and delight. When ever any Druse sheik comes from a neighbouring village, he is at once brought to sec the sight. The consequence is that I have no lack of visitors, and, foreseeing this, took care to have a special apartment called a \" liwan,\" exclusively devoted to their reception. They are thus barricaded from the rest of the house. OtherAvise, with the prying curiosity Avhich characterizes the race, privacy Avould be impossible. As it is, from morning to night there is always a group round the kitchen, much to the detriment of culinary opera tions and the annoyance of the servants engaged in them. Still, in order to keep on good terms, Ave have to make con cessions, to waste time over much drinking of coffee out of minute cups, to hear their gossip on local politics, and, Avhat is still more difficult, to try and give them some larger ideas than the very narrow ones which they have acquired upon these wild hillsides. Altogether, although their defects are of a somewhat try ing kind, and their essential insincerity makes them arrant humbugs, they are rather pleasant humbugs, and, provided they do not test one's affection by too many invitations to dinner, Avhich involves squatting on your heels and eating Avith your fingers, the Druses are, taking them altogether, by far the most agreeable class of people to live among in Palestine."], [182, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE DRUSES. Daliet-el-Carmel, Aug. 1. \u2014 A residence in a Druse vil lage upon the familiar terms which I have now established with the inhabitants of this one, opens up a phase of ex istence so utterly foreign to all Western notions of domestic life, and involves experiences so novel and characteristic, that I am constantly receiving illustrations of the truth of the saying that one half of the world has no idea hoAv the other half lives. Early the other morning, for instance, my native servant appeared in a state of no little excitement to tell me that there had been a row in the night in the village, from Avhich my house is distant only a few hundred yards, and that a young man Avas being killed. This Avas modified a few minutes after by the arrival of some Aveeping females, who said that if the young man could not find a place of refuge somewhere he would be killed; and, as if to emphasize this statement, no great interval elapsed before, on going out into the kitchen, I found the young man in question cling ing to the legs of the kitchen table as though they were the horns of the altar. He was a not very prepossessing-look ing young man of tAvo or three and twenty, and on my ap pearance he abandoned the legs of the table and rushed at my hand, which he seized and kissed effusively. It is as tonishing hoAv affectionate a man can become under the in fluence of panic. I told him to go back to the table-legs and hold on there, and consider himself perfectly safe. I felt I could say this Avith a feeling of proud satisfaction, for had I not the British government at my back, and is not the British government celebrated for the chiA-alrous promptitude with which it rushes to the rescue of those in bodily peril? Meantime I sent for the spiritual sheik of the village, as"], [183, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE DRUSES. 169 the secular one, -who is the real supreme authority in such matters, happened to be absent. Now, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the Avhole village, consisting of some five hundred souls, is related to the tAvo sheiks, for the pop ulation has gone on marrying and intermarrying till the re lationships are unfathomable. The young man in question Avas the youngest of four brothers, and he had one sister Avho had married the spiritual sheik's son. His mother, af ter having this numerous family, had married the secular sheik, who had himself had two sons by a former wife and Avho has one daughter by his present one. You \"will observe that the affair Avas already becoming mixed, and a strong suspicion was gradually stealing over me that there Avas a woman at the bottom of it. Such, indeed, proved to be the case; in fact, there turned out to be two. Now it happened, and this is not peculiar to the domestic relations of the Druses, that the secular sheik's sons by his first wife were very jealous of the children of their step mother, and hated that elderly lady herself Avith the cordial hatred not unknown to stepchildren. They had contrived so to embitter the family circle, that the secular sheik, partly for the sake of peace, and partly, as I afterAA'ards dis covered, for another reason, had banished her for two years past from the marital roof; indeed, it had often been a mat ter of surprise to me when calling on this sheik, or dining Avith him, that I Avas always waited on by his daughter and not by his wife. Now the mystery was solved; but the sheik did not ex tend this inhospitality to his stepsons, and the young man now holding on to the kitchen table was especially favoured, and, although not an inmate of his stepfather's house, made himself too much at home there to suit his half-brothers. They determined, therefore, to drive him forth. Noav, the sheik had another brother, who had a wife much younger than himself, and Avho, it Avas Avhispered, Avas much admired by the obnoxious young man. And it being the end of Ramadan, and the village being in a state of nocturnal fes tivity, people were in a mood for mischief all around, and, rightly or wrongly, the young man being found in the sheik's brother's house in the middle of the night, fell un-"], [184, "HAIFA, 170 der grave suspicion, and a tremendous tumult took place, in the course of which the sheik's son belaboured his step mother, being assisted thereto by his uncle; and here I may incidentally remark that Druse men appear to think nothing of beating their friends' wives, whose husbands seem to think it quite natural they should do so. Perhaps it saves them the trouble; anyhow, on this occasion the Avomen gave A-ent to their tongues, and the men retaliated with blows. Of course, the Avornen took the part of the gay but indis creet youth, who declared that he was in search of a missing cow, though it Avas suggested with some force that to go and look for her on the roof of the sheik's brother's house after midnight showed an unpardonable ignorance of the usual haunts of coavs. The whole of the secular sheik's first family, therefore, and their relations to the fifth degree, who form the majority of the male population, refusing to admit any such excuse, and considering the young man's guilt proved, voAved to have his life, death being the not uncommon penalty among them for a crime of this sort; but the whole of the spiritual sheik's family, which seems to me to consist principally of all the women in the village, accepted the young man's Aversion of the affair, and main tained his innocence; and, with that knowledge of human nature which characterizes the sex, they instinctively turned to me as their natural ally, and hence I was saddled with the protection of this too-susceptible and much-menaced youth. The position was delicate, for though I am not insensible to the advantage of possessing the suffrages of the female part of the community, I desired also to stand well with the males, and I felt that to interpose betAveen them and the object of their vengeance Avas likely to prejudice me in their eyes. At the same time one could not turn a youth out of one's kitchen to go like a sheep to the slaughter, even though he may have been an erring lamb. Moreover, when I came to hear the spiritual sheik's version of the story, though it Avas undoubtedly one-sided, the question of guilt did not appear to be satisfactorily established. So I sent for the injured husband, and the sheik's son, who had beaten his stepmother, to hear their A'ersion of the matter, but they refused to answer my summons."], [185, "DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE DRUSES. 171 Under these circumstances I determined to wait for the return of the secular sheik, which took place the same even ing. After sympathizing Avith him on the distracted con dition of his household, I asked him if he could suggest the best course of action for me to pursue, as it was evidently impossible for me to board and lodge his stepson for an indefinite time on the kitchen table. This, he admitted, was an undue tax on my hospitality. I asked him if he could not exercise sufficient authority over the members of his OAvn family to protect the life of his stepson. This, he said, he could do Avhile he remained in the village, but as he Avas constantly being called away on business, he could not an swer for Avhat might happen in his absence. I then asked whether it might not be best to send the young man away from the village until the storm had blown over. I had suggested this to the spiritual sheik, but he said that in that case the youth's mother Avould follow him; and, as I remarked to the secular sheik, I was loath to propose this to him, as it Avould separate him from his Avife. The sheik, with apparent distress, observed that his Avife did not see much of him. I asked whether I could not be the means of healing this breach, and whether he would al low me to send for his Avife; this he at once assented to, but the old lady refused to come. This refusal on her part seemed to afford the sheik immense relief, seeing Avhich, I remarked, \" Perhaps, if your wife did go away with your stepson, you Avould not mind it very much.\" \"No,\" he said, \" I should not mind it A-ery much.\" I have since discovered that he is very anxious to get rid of her, in order to marry some one else. So I packed the young man off to a Christian of my acquaintance at Esfia, two miles off, thinking his mother would follow him; but not a bit. She has now taken up her abode with the spir itual sheik, and I am at this moment employing her to make a mud floor under a fig-tree, on which I intend to put bee hives. I rode over a few days ago to Esfia, and found the young man comfortably installed with his Christian host, who, Avith true Arab hospitality, charges him nothing for his entertainment, but who will probably be indemnified for it by a present from the spiritual sheik. Meantime, influ-"], [186, "HAIFA. 172 ences are at work to prepare the way for his safe return, and I trust that I have so managed these delicate negotia tions as to secure me the good-Avill of both factions, though I am afraid that the breach between them Avill neArer be healed until the secular sheik divorces his present Avife and takes a fresh departure by uniting himself to the lady of his affections."], [187, "CIRCASSIAN HIGHWAYMEN.\u2014 A DRUSE FESTI- VAL AT ELIJAH'S ALTAR. Daliet-el-Carmel, Aug. 15. \u2014 About this time last year, when I was at Esfia, Ave Avere suddenly disturbed by the intelligence that a German teamster, whom I have been in the habit of employing, had been attacked in the night at the bridge over the Kishon, distant about three miles from my camp, while on his way from Haifa to Nazareth, by four Circassians, who, suddenly surrounding him, pointed their guns at his head, thus preventing him from using his re volver, which they stole from him, at the same time cutting the traces of his team and carrying off a valuable pair of horses, leaving the poor man helpless Avith his wagon at about one o'clock in the morning, far from any help, but thankful to haA-e escaped with his life. The whole machinery of the local police Avas put in mo tion, and the authorities professed to take up the matter in earnest. Some of the German colonists scoured the coun try in pursuit of the robbers, Avho appear to have fled to some Circassian colonies which Avere established about five years ago on the plains of Iturea, near the foot of Hermon, beyond the Jordan, and there all trace of them was lost. They had got among friends, who covered their tracks, and the horses were never recovered.* Since this time the colonists, Avho are constantly travel ling in their wagons between Haifa and Nazareth, and in the hottest weather generally make the journey by night, always go tAvo or three together, and had not been molested until a few nights ago, when two of them started for Naza reth, one of them the victim of last year. His companion, who had left Haifa a little before him, expecting to be shortly OA'ertaken, was jogging along at about 8 p.m., and * A year later the thieves were found, and the Circassian colony to which they belonged was compelled by the government to refund the Germans the value of the horses."], [188, "174 HAIFA. was not above four miles distant from Haifa, when a Cir cassian rode past him, wishing him good-evening. The German returned the salute, but his suspicions were roused by the man's manner, and he got his revolver ready. Al most immediately after he heard a whistle, the man Avho had passed him turned sharply back, and tAvo others sprang upon him from an ambush, where they had been concealed, by the roadside. One of them seized his horses' heads, Avhile the others began cutting the traces. The teamster instantly jumped from the box, and, unwilling to shoot before it was absolutely necessary, closed with one of the robbers, strik ing at him with the butt of his pistol. He was, hoAvever, nearly overpoAvered, and had just time, as he saAV his ad versary draAV a knife, to send a bullet through him. At this moment he received a severe bloAV on the back from one of the other men, Avho rushed to the assistance of his comrade, but the German, Avho was an old soldier and had been through the Franco-German campaign, Avas a quick shot, and knocked this man over with a second barrel. At this moment a fourth Circassian appeared upon the scene. Fortunately, the attacking party Avere only armed with knives. The tA\\ro remaining Circassians now, seeing that two of their number had been disposed of, began to draw off their bodies, it being a first principle of their warfare to carry away their dead. This gave the German, who was scarcely able to raise himself from the ground, a chance to fire two more shots, but, as it seemed at the time, Avithout effect, and the two Circassians, throwing the bodies of their companions over their horses, made off. By this time the other German teamster, Avho had been a quarter of a mile behind, but had pushed on on hearing the shots, came up and helped his wounded friend. He, however, Avas able to continue his journey to Nazareth, and in a few days recovered from the effects of his bruises. Meantime information has been received from a peasant where the Circassians passed the night, that one of them had been killed on the spot, that another died of his Avound shortly after he was brought to his cottage, and that the third had a ball through his leg, but that his Avound had not been sufficiently serious to prevent his continuing"], [189, "CIRCA SSL AN HIGHWAYMEN. 175 his journey the following night Avith the corpses of his companions. One would think, under these circumstances, that if the authorities chose there could be no great diffi culty in tracing the miscreants; but no steps Avhatever have been taken in the matter, which is, perhaps, the best solu tion of it, for whenever a foreigner is unhappily obliged to kill a native in self-defence in this country the chance is that he has to stand his trial on a counter charge of murder. Now, thanks to the precautions taken by the Circassians, and the apathy of the government, there is no proof of any one having been killed, and the Circassians have received a much severer punishment than any that woifid have been inflicted upon them for horse-stealing by the authorities, and they are likely to be careful hoAv they meddle again Avith the Germans. Opinions are divided as to whether they -will seek their revenge or not. The Germans still continue to team by night to Nazareth, but they go in parties of never less than three wagons together, and well armed. Had the robbers been Bedouins or native Arabs, this encounter would mean a blood feud, and sooner or later revenge Avould be taken; but I once spent some Aveeks with the Circassians in their own country, and I do not think that they have the same custom of vendetta. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that they are a most laAvless and thieving set as colonists, I found them a very safe and pleasant people to travel among in their OAvn mountains, Avhere they have their code of honour and hospitality, and I have spent a clay with them in one of their colonies beyond Jordan, and received nothing but civility. It would, however, be better to keep them in those wild and half-savage regions than bring them within range of the temptations Avhich civilization offers to them. I have just seen a man who has been paying them a visit at the old city of Jerash, which, with the exception of Palmyra, is the most perfect Greco-Roman ruin which exists to the east of Baalbec. My informant tells me that in the course of their excavations for stone for their habitations they are making great discoA'eries. They have unearthed a heretofore undiscovered and unsuspected temple, with a subterranean conduit of flowing water, and many fragments"], [190, "176 HAIFA. of statues and coins. One large jar of gold coins, worth $50 each, was an immense prize, which they only succeeded in keeping by paying a bribe to the government official of $2500. My informant saw one of these coins, but, as he Avas a native, and ignorant of such matters, his description Avas too vague to convey any definite idea of their date. I should feel much tempted to pay these ruins, which I have already examined once, another visit, but of late years the government throws so many obstacles in the way of travel lers to the east of the Jordan that such a journey now may expose one to annoyances. Meantime, there are many objects of interest in this im mediate neighbourhood; within a distance of three miles I have found the extensive remains of what have been un doubtedly iron and copper mines. The former ore was present in large quantities, and the day may come when this discovery may prove of considerable \\-alue to this part of the country, though it Avould be useless, under existing conditions, to take any steps towards its exploration now. It is probable that the old iron rings which I found in dig ging the foundations of my house were made from this ore. I have also found a curious square structure, fourteen feet in height, twelve feet square, composed of stones aver aging three feet by two, by about one in thickness, all care fully squared, and laid one upon another without cement, the whole forming a perfectly solid erection of great an tiquity. It may possibly have been a vineyard watch tower. It is on the way from here to the \" Place of Burn ing,\" or Elijah's sacrifice, and is the second I have found in that neighbourhood, the other being considerably small er. I came upon it accidentally on the occasion of a Druse picnic to which I was invited, and which took place at the \" Place of Burning,\" in celebration of the last day of the feast of Ramadan, which the Druses seem to observe as well as the Moslems, though on a different day. The female population of the village, in their gayest dresses, had preceded us on donkeys. I accompanied the sheik, who had drawn up on a little plain outside the town about a dozen horsemen as an escort, and thus, after a little of the usual imitation of the equestrian game of the djerrid,"], [191, "A DRUSE FESTIVAL AT ELIJAH'S ALTAR. 177 at Avhich, in default of the real thing, the horsemen delight to exercise their horses by a mock encounter, Ave formed in a sort of procession, the young men of the village on foot, armed Avith great clubs, chanting songs of love and war, as they marched in front. There were from tAvo to three hundred persons collected on the flat space in front of the church which the Carmelite monks have recently erected on the supposed site of Elijah's altar. And here the usual dancing-circles Avere formed, and the fun of the day com menced. But it was melancholy fun. How could it be otherwise, Avhen the young men and Avomen are not alloAved to dance together, scarcely even to speak to one another ? It was quite pitiful to see half a dozen of the prettiest girls that could be found in Syria sitting under the shade of a tree, gossiping, and looking at half a dozen fine, stalwart, handsome young fellows prancing about on their horses, or singing and dancing, Avithout there being the ghost of a chance of a flirtation. The girls cooked together and ate together and danced together and sang together, and the young men amused themsehes apart as best they could. As the delights of flirting are unknown to them, I suppose they did not miss them; but as I looked at the young peo ple of both sexes thus divided, I wondered what Avould be the result of a similar experiment if it Avere tried at an American picnic. It was a curious sight to see a bevy of at least fifty Avom en and girls rush into the Carmelite chapel, Avhich during the week is left in charge of a Druse, Avho on this occasion did the honours of it to his coreligionists, Avho scampered all over the premises, gazing Avonderingly at the altar or naments, and forming large dancing- circles on the flat roof. I could not exactly find out Avhy the Druses chose the place of Elijah's sacrifice as the scene of their festivity, but there is no doubt that the traditions of a special sanc tity are attached to it in their religion as Avell as in that of the Roman Catholics, and that the slaughter of the eight hundred false prophets by the holy man whose prayers for rain Avere heard on this spot, and upon Avhom the divine ven geance was invoked, appeals to a sentiment Avhich is com mon to the Christian, the Moslem, and the Druse religions. 12"], [192, "ARMAGEDDON.\u2014 THE BOSNIAN COLONY AT C\u00c6SAREA. Daliet - el - Carmel, Sept. 11. \u2014 There is no fact at first more puzzling to the traveller in Palestine than the contrast between the misery and poverty of the fellahin and the extent and fertility of land owned by each village. This is, however, the inevitable result of the various fiscal devices to which the government has been compelled to re sort, in order to provide a revenue which shall meet the needs of its internal administration, and the claims of its foreign bondholders. These press more severely on the peasant class than on any other in the community, and as the financial necessities of the empire increase, neAV meth ods are being constantly devised to meet them. Thus the latest arrangement requires the taxes to be paid in money instead of in kind, as heretofore, the amount being assessed on an average of the crops extending over a period of five years. This has produced the greatest consternation among the peasantry throughout the country, Avho find them selves quite unable to meet this new demand, and who are compelled, in consequence, to resort to extortionate money lenders, who charge from thirty to forty per cent, for their advances, thus ruining the fellahin, whose villages are all destined by this process to fall into the hands of these grasp ing usurers, while the peasants remain upon them as serfs, merely receiving so much of the crop as will keep them from starving. Thus it happened that, in the belief that I had more bowels of compassion than their own countrymen, I was applied to by the villagers in all directions; among others, hy those who owned the lands of Lejjun, or the bib lical Megiddo. This is generally supposed to be identical with Armageddon, and the notion of becoming the proprie tor of a battle-field which possesses such interesting his-"], [193, "ARMAGEDDON. 179 torical associations in the past, to say nothing of the future, which may be mythical or not, according to theological fancy, induced me to pay a visit to that celebrated locality. Its position Avas as tempting as its sentimental considerations were remarkable. Here, jutting out into the plain of Es dr\u00e6lon, of which it commands an extensive view, stands the Tell et Mutsellim, or governor's hill, upon which the traces of what may have been a palace are distinctly visible. Right opposite to us across the plain, about twelve miles distant, the houses of Nazareth gleam upon the lofty hillside; to the right are Tabor, Little Hermon, and Mount Gilboa, with the mountains of Gilead in the rear. Beneath, circling round the base of the mound, are \" the waters of Megiddo,\" a copious stream, turning two Avater-mills and irrigating au extensive tract of plain. Behind us is an undulating plateau coA'ered Avith the ruins of the ancient city. Here are frag ments of columns, carved capitals and cornices, and I found some subterranean chambers into Avhich I crawled, and which, as they connected with the stream by stone conduits, I assume must, in old times, have been baths. The peasants hav-e found antiques of various kinds, and I Avas shown the hand and forearm of a female figure, life-size, and beauti fully carved in marble, Avhich they had dug up. There is no saying what treasures the fortunate proprietor of this place may not unearth, and with the wealth of Avater at his command, of which but little advantage is noAv taken, he might have extensive gardens and orange groves. From this point a great military road passed, in the most ancient times, connecting Galilee with the coast road. Along it, before the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites, Thothmes, the King of Egypt, led his invading hosts into Syria. Here, by \" the Avaters of Megiddo,\" was fought the great battle betAveen Barak and Sisera, when the stars in their courses fought against Sisera; and on the same ground, six centuries later, the hosts of Pharaoh Necho met the army of Josiah, King of Judah, and vanquished it, while the king himself, being \" sore Avounded \" as he rode in his chariot, Avas carried away to Jerusalem to die. On making inquiries of a practical kind in regard to the"], [194, "180 HAIFA. present financial position of this property and its peasant owners, I began to suspect that any foreigner who desired to become its possessor would find himself involved in a struggle of a different kind from that of which in past times it has been the scene, and one more consonant with the spirit of the age in which we live. The invasion of Palestine of late years by foreigners of all religions and nationalities, the constant influx of Jews, and the increasing attention which the Holy Land is concentrating upon itself, has so far alarmed the Porte that foreigners are practically prohibited from purchasing any more land in the country; and the peasantry of the villages Avho applied to me for as sistance were informed that, even if I were prepared to lend them money, they Avere not to be allowed to borrow. I Avas thus relieved of the great annoyance of having con stantly to refuse applications, Avhich, under any circumstan ces, I could not have satisfied. From Megiddo I followed the historical higbAvay through the mountain, which, in the days of Christ, when C\u00e6sarea was rising into its grandeur, must have been one of the most frequented routes in the country. The road led through charmingly diversified scenery. I turned off from it to ascend to the town of Umm-el-Fahm, an important place, containing about two thousand inhabitants, situated on copse-clothed hills, at an elevation of fifteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, and commanding extensive vieAvs. Here I was the guest of a local millionaire, noted for his penurious habits and his grasping nature. His rag ged appearance and humble establishment did not belie his reputation. I had, however, no reason to complain, for, if the accommodation Avas rough, his intentions AArere certainly hospitable. The romantic valleys by which the village is surrounded are thickly planted with olive groves, which contain over a hundred thousand trees, and are a great source of revenue. While, Avhen they are too far from the village for the pro tection of any crop, the hillsides and summits are clothed with a dense undergroAvth of scrub oak, terebinth, and other shrubs, which are only prevented from becoming forest trees by the charcoal-burners ; but their quick growth testifies to"], [195, "ARMAGEDDON. 181 the richness of the soil. To the north the range extends for fifteen miles, to the base of Carmel. The woodland disap pears, and is succeeded by rolling chalk downs, affording magnificent pasturage and good arable land, for it is Avell watered, and from its temperate and healthy climate is called the \" breezy land.\" The villages here are small, few, and far between, and there is room for a large population; but the most tempting land of all is the tract between Umm-el-Fahm and the sea, Avhere the oak-trees which are scattered over the pastures and cornfields attain a large groAvth, and the country pre sents the appearance of an immense park. From an artis tic point of view the woods and the farm lands are so com bined as to form the most perfectly diversified scenery, just where the rolling hills slope gently down into the plain of Sharon. It was across this country that our road lay to C\u00e6sarea, Avhich was our objective point, first, through the thick copse of the upper valleys, and so out upon the park like uplands, where the Avhole population was out in the fields gathering the crops, Avhich strings of camels were con- A-eying to the village threshing-floors. Here and there was a money-lender from Acre or Beyrout, squatting under an umbrella, to see that the peasantry did not rob him of his share. This is a busy time Avith these gentry, who are the bloodsuckers of the fellahin, to Avhom they advance money at exorbitant rates of interest, Avhile the latter, in revenge, resort to every conceivable device to conceal from them the real extent of the crop, and to make the proportion coming to them as small as possible. At one village called Arareh I found three old Roman arches, a fine fragment of a column, and some rock-cut tombs, which seem hitherto to have escaped observation. The remains indicate that it must have been a place of con siderable importance, but I have not yet been able to iden tify it. The plain of Sharon, where we struck it, is being by degrees brought into cultivation, partly by colonists, Circassian and Bosnian, and partly by native capitalists. The peasantry themselves are rapidly losing all proprietor ship in the soil, unable to contend against the exactions of the government tax-gatherer, on the one hand, and of the"], [196, "HAIFA 182 usurious money-lender, on the other; but Avhile they are yearly becoming more impoverished and dependent, the wealth of the country is steadily increasing, and its develop ment must follow as a matter of course, though, in accord ance Avith the tendencies of modern civilization, it will be at the expense of the masses. I went to lunch Avith the largest of these local magnates. He Avas a Turk, and spoke Turkish in preference to Arabic. He had, as may be supposed, little sympathy with the Arab peasantry, who Avere practically his serfs, and their condi tion was by no means improved by their lands having fall en into his hands. On the other hand, they never Avould have introduced the civilized iron ploughs with which he was bringing land into cultivation. His farm-house Avas a large, straggling, isolated building, Avhich stood on a hillock in the plain, with extensive outhouses and dependencies, not unlike the residence of a Southern planter, while, curi ously enough, a large proportion of his farm hands con sisted of African negroes located in a village hard by \u2014 but he had none of the lavish hospitality Avhich characterized the landed proprietors of the South. A ride of an hour over a part of the plain which, from the peculiar quality of its soil, is exclusively devoted to the growth of Avater-melons, hitherto the sole export of the lit tle haven of C\u00e6sarea, brought me to that spot. Although the remains of the old port have been used as a harbour for coasting craft, these ruins have not been inhabited since they were evacuated by the crusaders at the end of the thirteenth century. Indeed, there is a curious prediction connected with them, to the effect that the rebuilding of a town here Avould immediately precede a great disaster to Islam. It has been in consequence of this, as I .have understood, that while villages have sprung up on all the other crusading ruins on the coast, this one alone has re mained untenanted. However this may be, the spell is broken now, for about six months ago the first instal ment of a band of refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina arrived here, having been allotted this ruin and the lands surrounding it by the government, as the nucleus of a new colony."], [197, "THE BOSNIAN COLONY AT C\u00c6SAREA. 183 Apart from the great interest Avhich these extensive ruins must ever have from an antiquarian point of view, I was anxious to visit C\u00e6sarea to judge for myself of the pros pects of this embryo colony, and make personal acquaint ance with this new and interesting class of immigrants. Moreover, as the new town is to be built upon the ruins of the old, it was evident that I should never have another chance of seeing what these were like. They have already during the last twenty years served as a quarry from whence the magnificent building-stones, cut originally by Herod the Great Avhen he built the town, have been transported in thousands of boat-loads to Acre and Jaffa. The ruins have therefore lost much of the pristine grandeur Avhich is de scribed in the records of travellers in the early part of the present century. In a few years more they will probably have disappeared altogether. The subterranean treasures, whatever they may be, will, however, remain untouched, and the Schliemann of a future age will find here the traces of five successive epochs of civilization. On the top he will find the ruins of the stone houses of the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, now in process of erection; below them the foundations of the great Crusading fortress, and beloAv them again the remains of the first Mohammedan period; beneath them, traces of the Byzantine period, and, at the bottom, the tessellated pavements, the fragments of carved marble, the statuary, and the coins of the Ro man period. Meantime it is a singular fact that the strip of coast from Haifa to C\u00e6sarea seems to have become a centre of influx of colonists and strangers of the most diverse races. The new immigrants to C\u00e6sarea are Slavs. Some of them speak a little Turkish. Arabic is an unknown tongue to them, which they are learning. Their own language is a Slav dialect. When the troubles in the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina first broke out, which led to the Russo- Turkish war, a howl of indignation went up from the phi lanthropists on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially from the Radical party in England, against the Turkish government, for its persecution of the Slav population of the Danubian provinces. Nor do I think that the general"], [198, "184 HAIFA public have yet realized the fact that of these Slavs more than half were Moslem, and that the Turkish government was not persecuting them more than it was persecuting any other of its subjects, but that the persecutors of the Slav peasantry, who Avere Christian, Avere the Slav aris tocracy, who Avere Moslem. It was, in fact, not a question of an oppressed nationality, but a strictly agrarian question between people of the same race. When it Avas settled by handing over the provinces to Austria, the Slav-Moslem aristocracy, finding themselves in their turn persecuted by their former peasants and the Christian power Avhich pro tected them, migrated to the more congenial rule of the sultan. So the curious spectacle is presented of a Slav pop ulation migrating from Austrian rule to Asia, in order to be under a Moslem government. Close beside the new Bosnian colony there are planted in the plain of Sharon two or three colonies of Circassians. These are the people who committed the Bulgarian atroci ties. The irony of fate has now placed them within three or four miles of colonists belonging to the very race they massacred. They, too, fleeing from government by Chris tians, have sought refuge under the sheltering wing of the sultan, Avhere, I regret to say, as I described in a former let ter, they still indulge in their predatory propensities. In immediate proximity to them are the black tents of a tribe of Turcomans. They belong to the old Seljuk stock, aud the cradle of their tribe gave birth to the present rulers of the Turkish Empire. They have been here for about three hundred years, and have forgotten the Turkish language, but a few months ago a neAv migration arriA'ed from the mountains of Mesopotamia. These nomads spoke nothing but Turkish, and hoped to find a warm welcome from their old tribesmen on the plain of Sharon. In this they were disappointed, and they have now, to my disgust, pitched their tents on some of the spurs of Carmel, where their great hairy camels and their own baggy breeches contrast curiously with the camels and costumes of the Bedouins Avith whom we are familiar. Besides the Slavs, the Circassians, and the Turcomans, we have the Jewish colony of Zimmarin, distant about"], [199, "THE BOSNIAN COLONY AT C\u00c6SAREA. 185 ten miles from C\u00e6sarea; the German colony at Haifa, and the Druse villages on Carmel, making, -with the Bedouins, the negroes, and the native fellahin, no fewer than nine different races engaged in the cultivation of the soil in this neighbourhood."], [200, "C\u00c6SAREA. Daliet-el-Carmel, Oct. 2. \u2014 The habit of tourists of vis iting only those spots in Palestine called holy places, or to which some striking Biblical association is attached, causes them to neglect ruins of the highest historical interest, and which are often as Avell Avorth seeing from a picturesque as from an arch\u00e6ological point of view. They make an effort to go to Nazareth, which differs in no respect from an ordi nary Syrian town, and which does not boast a single object of antiquarian interest, while they omit from their pro gramme, because it is not included in the books, a ruin like C\u00e6sarea, a city unsurpassed for grandeur and magnifi cence by anything in Palestine Avhen Herod raised it to the dignity of a metropolis, and the scene of many important events, both Biblical and historical. Here Peter baptized the first Gentile convert to Christianity; here Philip lived with his four daughters, engaged in missionary work; here Paul preached before Felix, and \" almost persuaded \" Agrippa to become a Christian. It Avas in the theatre, the remains of which are still to be seen, that Herod made his oration to the multitude Avhen \" the angel of the Lord smote him, and he was eaten of Avorms and gave up the ghost.\" It was in the streets of C\u00e6sarea that, on the occa sion of a quarrel between the Greek and Jewish population, twenty thousand Jews were massacred. Here the celebrat ed historians Eusebius and Procopius were born, and here Avas found, when the city Avas taken by the crusaders, the hexagonal vase of green crystal which Avas supposed to con tain the Holy Grail. The old Roman Avail can be traced for a mile and a half, enclosing an area streAvn with the remains of a theatre, hip podrome, temple, aqueducts, and mole ; while a second line of fortification, still in admirable preservation, and over"], [201, "C\u00c6SAREA. 187 half a mile in extent, marks the enceinte of the old Crusad ing fortress, with its castle and donjon keep, its cathedral, its Northern church, and harbour. This tendency on the part of travellers is the more to be regretted as the oppor tunity of examining these extensive ruins is now about to pass away, never again to return. The Slav colonists, Avhose immigration I described in my last letter, are laying out broad streets right across the most interesting ruins, using the old foundations, appropriating the beautiful masonry, the Avhite stones which formed the temple built by Herod, and the brown limestone blocks of the cathedral of the crusaders, quarrying into ancient build ings beneath the surface of the ground, leA'elling doAvn the ruins at one place, levelling them up in another, and so ut terly transforming the whole picturesque area that it will soon be no longer recognizable. Within five months over twenty good stone houses have been built, some of three stories high, others Avith vaults for merchandise and stor ing grain ; in some cases the old Crusading vaults, evident ly used for the same purpose, have been made available. The dAvellings are being built on the plan Avhich renders the tOAvns of the Moslem Slavs of European Turkey so dull and uninteresting; they are all enclosed Avith courtyards, the high stone Avails of Avhich jealously guard the harems of the proprietors. In this respect these Avestern Mohammedans are far more particular than the Arabs, who allow their women comparative freedom; but during the period of my stay in C\u00e6sarea I did not see one of the female colonists. Their male belongings, however, were most hospitable, especially when they found that I kneAV their country and Avas familiar with Mostar and Cognitza, in the neighbour hood of which towns had been their former homes. They were the landed aristocracy of their own country, and have, therefore, brought a considerable amount of wealth with them. A large tract of the most fertile land of the plain of Sharon has been donated to them by the Turkish govern ment, and there can be no doubt that the country will gain by their settlement in it. In manners and costume they form a marked contrast to the natives, Avho are evidently much impressed by their wealth and dignity."], [202, "188 HAIFA The lower or peasant class of Bosnia and Herzegovina were not obliged, when the country was conquered by the Moslems, to change their religion, and they have continued Christians; while the descendants of their masters, who re mained the proprietors of the soil, became bigoted Mussul mans. The consequence has been that now that the coun try has been handed over to the Austrians, the Christian peasantry have naturally found protection from the author ities against the oppression of their former masters, who, unable to endure the humiliation of seeing the tables turned, and their old servants enabled to defy them with impunity, have sold all their possessions and migrated to the domin ions of the sultan, rather than endure the indignities to which they declare they Avere exposed from their neAV Chris tian rulers and their old Christian serfs \u2014 very much on the same principle that the Southern States became intolerable to some of the landed proprietors after the emancipation of their slaves. Whether they Avill agree with their Circas sian neighbours remains yet to be seen. They form the avant garde of a much larger migration which is to follow as soon as arrangements can be made to receive them. One of the leading men, Avho has opened a store, assigned me an unfinished house as a lodging, and said that he intended to enlarge it into a hotel for travellers. It is worthy of the notice of intending travellers in Pal estine next season that they can now drive the whole way, if they wish, in Avagons belonging to the German colonists, from Jerusalem to Nazareth, in four easy days, instead of having to ride, and camp in tents as heretofore. There are excellent hotels at Jaffa. The next stopping-place Avould, now that accommodation is promised there, be C\u00e6sarea, the next day to Haifa, Avhere the hotel is being enlarged and put on a thoroughly comfortable and European basis, and the next day to Nazareth, Avhere good quarters can be ob tained at the convent, but Avhere, if this route comes to be adopted, a hotel will doubtless shortly be built. As soon as travellers give up their present expensive habit of travel ling through Palestine with tents, the hotel accommodation will be increased, and the existing carriage roads, as well as the vehicles which traverse them, be improved. The gov-"], [203, "C\u00c6SAREA. 189 ernment has recently determined to oonstruct a carriage road along the coast from Acre to Beyrout and Tripoli, which, if it is carried out, will alter all the existing condi tions of travel. The most striking features of the ruins of C\u00e6sarea are the Crusading castle and the old Roman mole. The former is built upon a long, narroAV reef or breakwater, partly arti ficial, Avhich runs out into the sea for one hundred and sixty yards, forming the southern side of the harbour, while the northern side is formed by a sort of mole or jetty more than two hundred feet long, Avhich is composed of some sixty or seventy prostrate columns lying side by side in the Avater like roAvs of stranded logs. They are from five to twenty feet in length, and average about eighteen inches in diame ter. .1 never in my life before saw such an array of granite pillars so closely piled together or used for such a purpose. Indeed, to judge by those which remain, C\u00e6sarea must have been a city of columns. The crusaders used them to thor ough-bind their walls, from Avhich the butts project like roAvs of cannon from the side of a man-of-war. They must have built many hundreds of old Roman columns thus into their fortification. The Crusading wall enclosing the town rises from a moat Avhich is about forty feet wide, but, being much filled in with rubbish, is not more than five or six feet deep. The Avail itself is about nine feet thick, with buttresses at inter vals which are from thirty to fifty feet long and project from twenty to twenty-six feet; but it is especially in the castle and donjon, which is built out into the sea on the projecting reef, that the columns are used as thorough-bonds. Some of these are of red granite, others of gray. The Bos nian colonists are perching a cafe on the ruins of the old donjon, immediately above two magnificent prostrate col umns of red granite, nine feet long and four in diameter. I observed here also a finely polished block of red granite over six feet square and three feet six inches thick. There is also a curious double tessellated pavement, evidently of tAvo periods, as the upper tesser\u00e6 are at least six inches above the loAver ones. I am afraid, as the masons are Avork ing immediately above them, they will soon disappear, as"], [204, "190 HAIFA Avill also a beautiful carved capital in white marble. I scrambled up to the top of this picturesque ruin, where the rib of the groined roof of the upper chamber still remains supported on a corbel in the form of a human head, and looked out of the pointed, arched window sheer down sev enty feet on the sea, beating against the base of the sea wall. The mouth of the small artificial harbour is about two hundred yards across, but the latter is too much ex posed and too small ever to be of much value. Among the Roman remains, the hippodrome, the theatre, and the aqueduct are the most interesting. The first is a sunken leArel space about three hundred yards long by one hundred wide, surrounded by a mound, and in the middle are three truncated blocks of red granite, Avhich, Avhen stand ing on each other, must have formed a conical pillar about nine feet high and seven feet diameter at the base. There is also another fine block of red granite nearly forty feet long and four feet in diameter, which has been broken. The theatre is a semicircular building of masonry in au im mense artificial mound, surrounded by a trench near the sea. It is mentioned by Josephus as capable of containing a large number of persons. Indeed, the account by this historian of the building of this city by Herod the Great, which I have just been reading, is most interesting. It occupied twelve years, and was finished thirteen years before Christ. He says that the stones of which the sea Avail was built were fifty feet in length, eighteen in breadth, and nine in depth. For nearly six hundred years it was a Christian city and the seat of an archbishop, then for five hundred years it fell under Moslem rule, and an Arab traveller in a.d. 1035 de scribes it as \" an agreeable city, irrigated with running wa ter and planted with date palms and oranges, surrounded by a strong Avail pierced by an iron gate, and containing a fine mosque.\" Then for one hundred and fifty years it re mained a Crusading stronghold, while its final and complete destruction by the Sultan Bibars took place in 1265 a.d., since which time it has remained a howling Avilderness. I have dwelt somewhat fully on the present aspect of the ruins, as the transformation they are undergoing will soon be complete."], [205, "C\u00c6SAREA. 191 From C\u00e6sarea I folloAved the coast northward with the high - level aqueduct, Avhich in places is still in tolerably good preservation, on my right. This aqueduct was the chief source of the water supply for the inhabitants. It was eight miles long, and at one point tunnels the rock for a quarter of a mile, thirty feet below its surface. There Avas also a loAV-level aqueduct, three miles long, which drew its water supply from the Crocodile River. At some sea sons this is a dangerous stream to ford, though I experi enced no difficulty. That it is not misnamed I possess indis putable proof, for a few weeks ago an Arab acquaintance presented me with a piece of crocodile skin about a foot square, cut from the hide of a crocodile Avhich he himself helped to kill in this river. Passing Tantura, Avhich also contains some Crusading ruins and rock-cut tombs, I reached the JeAvish colony of Zimmarin, Avhich I had not visited for eighteen months, and Avhere I was pleased to find the colony in a thriving condition, the colonists hopeful, industrious, and contented, the crops promising fairly, and their prog ress only checked by the refusal of the government to al low them to build permanent dwellings, a difficulty Avhich it is hoped may be overcome by a judicious display of firm ness and patience."], [206, "VILLAGE FEUDS. Daliet-el-Caemel, Oct. 15. \u2014 In order to really under stand this country, to become acquainted Avith the inner life of its inhabitants, to familiarize one's self with their manners and customs, their necessities, and their aspirations, such as they are, and to arrive at a true estimate of the na tional character, it is needful to remove one's self from any centre of so-called civilization, however crude, and to live among them, as I haA-e been doing for the last three months and a half, not as a stranger, but as a villager owning prop erty, identified with their local interests, and with a will to afford them such practical counsel and aid as may lie in one's power. People wonder Avhat I can find to do in a re mote Druse village in the back parts of Carmel; but in practice the days are not long enough to deal with the A-aried interests that crowd into them. Scarcely a day passes that visitors do not arrive from some of the surrounding villages \u2014 sheiks of high or low de gree, as the case may be \u2014 generally with polite invitations that I should return their A-isits, which I know from expe rience means a financial proposition of some sort in reserve, for all the villages are more or less embarrassed in their pe cuniary circumstances, and have been so victimized by the native money-lenders of Haifa that they eagerly turn tow ards any one Avho they think possesses boAvels of compas sion. The return visits which these invitations involve are often highly characteristic in their attendant circumstances, and in the varied incidents which accompany them; and, besides, they give one . an opportunity of becoming minutely ac quainted with the neighbourhood, and afford one an insight into the motives by which Oriental human nature is actuated. There is, for instance, a village about four miles from here,"], [207, "VILLAGE FEUDS. 193 so beautifully situated among its olive groves, as seen from a distance, that I had long intended paying it a visit, and Avondered why its sheik had never come to make my ac quaintance. The mystery Avas explained one day by an old Avoman Avhose extreme poverty had induced me to employ her as a Avater-carrier. On asking how she had become so destitute, she said that she Avas a Avidow, and that her only son and support had been Avaylaid and murdered some months previously by some of the young men of the village in question. All her efforts to obtain justice had been un availing, and since then the two villages had not been on visiting terms. As none of the inhabitants of Dalieh would accompany me, I found my own Avay one day to the village, to try and discover the rights of the story. I was received Avith great politeness by a tall, gentlemanlike man, Avhom I supposed to be the sheik, but Avho turned out to be the very individ ual Avho had been accused of the murder. Soon the sheik and a number of village notables arrived, and, seated around the neatly-matted guest-chamber, Ave exchanged compli ments and discussed the topics of the day. These all turn upon the payment of the neAV government taxes; and the price of wheat this year has been so low that the unhappy peasantry are driven to their Avits' end, and finally to usu rious money-lenders, to obtain the necessary cash. In this emergency I am appealed to in every direction for assist ance, and I was Avell aAvare that our interview on this occa sion Avould not terminate Avithout the usual demand. When it came, I saw my chance for alluding to the deli cate subject of the murder, and the objections I entertained to lending money to people Avho were in the habit of mur dering their neighbours. They admitted the murder, Avhich had been attended with robbery, but my host denied that he had been in any Avay implicated, though he had unjustly suffered several months' imprisonment on suspicion, and had only been finally released on payment of a heavy sum as backsheesh. It seems that the evidence as to who the cul prit really was rested on the dying deposition of the victim, who had been attacked by four men, all of whom he named on his deathbed. On the other hand, my host had succeeded 13"], [208, "194 HAIFA in proving an alibi. The real culprit had, he said, escaped, and had never ventured back to the village. Under these circumstances I refused any loan of money, unless the notables of the village would come to Dalieh, tender their humble apologies, offer a money indemnity to the mother of the murdered man, and effect a complete reconciliation. This, according to Arab custom, is a solemn ceremony, which must be performed in the presence of the notables of neighbouring villages; but it yet remained to be seen Avhether the indemnity question could be arranged at Dalieh, as the man who said be had been unjustly ac cused declared that he had already suffered so much, in person and in purse, that he was indisposed to do much in that line. The poor widow, in spite of her destitution, was still more intractable; she thirsted for vengeance, for AA'hich she said no money could compensate. However, I have hopes of bringing them both to reason, and so healing the feud which extends to all the population of both A-illages. Meantime the loan stands in abeyance. There Avould, indeed, be a good opening for a professional peacemaker in these villages, where feuds are bitter, and prevalent, not merely between different villages, but be tween rival sheiks in the same locality. There are almost always two, and sometimes three, of these in each vil lage who are not on speaking terms, and who each haA-e their partisans, so that the opposing factions keep them selves entirely aloof from each other. More than once I have had occasion to call on the same day on two rival sheiks. In that case one escorts me until he sees his enemy in the distance. He then takes leave of me, and I stand still until the other comes up to take me in charge. These sheiks, I am sorry to say, often combine with the money lenders against the interests of their own fellow-villagers. The mode by which a money-lender obtains possession of a village is simple; he goes to the sheik, and says: \" You and your village are unable to meet the government demands; if you will persuade your village to borrow from me at forty per cent., I will give you so much commission, and if at the end of three years you can manage irretrievably to ruin your villagers, so that I can come down upon them and"], [209, "VILLAGE FEUDS. 195 obtain possession of the village in satisfaction of my debt for half its value, your profit shall be so much, and you shall retain such a share of the village lands.\" As the sheiks wield an unbounded influence over their own fac tion, this would be an easy operation were it not for the rival sheik, who is in negotiation with a rival money lender. When two money-lenders take to fighting over a village there is some chance for the villagers, and from this point of view the feuds of their sheiks are not an un mixed evil. Where a sheik is supreme, as at Dalieh, he has practically the fortunes of the villagers in his hands, and he must be watched to see that he uses his influence and authority just ly. The only man in a position to watch him is the person upon whom he depends for assistance to meet the govern ment demands. If this individual happens to be content with a moderate rate of interest, and to have no ulterior de signs upon the village itself, it is evident that he may have it in his poAver to do a great deal of good. The villagers are quite astonished if one comes to them and says, \"I do not want your village, I only Avant your good-will. I desire to help you out of your financial scrape, and I am willing to lend you money at the legal rate of interest if you Avill fur nish me with the necessary security.\" Any one saying this finds at once that he has arrayed against him the money lenders, Avho take three times the legal rate of interest; the government officials, Avho go shares with the money-lenders; and, in many instances, the village sheiks themselves, Avho, of course, find their interest lies rather Avith these tAvo classes than with the unhappy villagers. These latter, ac customed to be plundered all around, naturally do not know whom to trust, and are apt to look with suspicion on a new proposal, hoAvever favourable and disinterested it may seem. The obstacles, therefore, to the working-out of improved conditions by any single man, even in the case of one vil lage, seem almost insuperable, and can only be overcome by much personal intercourse with the villagers them selves. The Druses are sensitive to kindness, and grateful for it, and as there are generally some sick in the village, and"], [210, "196 HAIFA quack doctoring, provided one treads cautiously, is better than none, we do a good deal of empirical practice, and our efforts have met with such success that we are obtaining a someAvhat alarming reputation. Of course, we come across difficult cases, as, for instance, the sheik's daughter. She is rather a nice-looking girl of eighteen, with a crick in her neck and an asthmatic affection. On asking how long she had been ill, we were informed that her mother, on the oc casion of her birth, was so angry at finding the child was a girl and not a boy, that she threw her out of the Avindow, and she had never been Avell since. Cases of this sort Ave don't attempt to grapple with, but I have ceased to wonder at the sheik having taken a dislike to the old lady. Indeed, my own feelings towards her have entirely changed since hearing of this episode, and, although it happened eighteen years ago, I treat her Avith comparative coolness. Why the sheik hesitates so long about divorcing her I fail to understand, more especially as he is anxious to marry a young and handsome girl. I have discovered, by the way, that divorced people are never allowed to meet again, even in the street, after the separation has finally taken place. I saw a young friend of mine, in a fit of passion, di vorce his wife last year. She Avas young and pretty. He married again, but has already repented, and Avants to di vorce his present and remarry his first Avife, Avhom he has never seen since; but Druse law is inexorable on this point. There was a meeting of elders on the subject, but they de cided that it was impossible. So now, Avhen this rash young man sees the former partner of his life at the other end of the street, he is obliged hurriedly to turn around and walk the other way, with a sadly beating heart and repent ant spirit. Some weeks ago we opened a boys' school at Dalieh, where English and Arabic Avere taught. In a few days we had an average attendance of over fifty children, while we received applications from more than twenty girls, Avhich Ave Avere making arrangements to satisfy, as the desire which the parents manifested to have their children edu cated was so strong that Ave felt it should be encouraged in every possible Avay. One day, however, a summons ar-"], [211, "VILLAGE FEUDS. 197 rived for the sheik to appear before the authorities, when he Avas informed that a fine of $250 would be levied on every child Avho ventured to go to school; a threat which, to my great regret, most effectually extinguished that humble in stitution."], [212, "THE ARISTOCRACY OF MOUNT CARMEL. Daliet-el-Caemel, Oct. 30. \u2014 I have been making ac quaintance with some of my neighbours, and will take you with me to call upon what in England Avould be called the leading members of the county aristocracy. They are the blue blood of this region of country, the families which in the early part of the present century exercised power of life and death, and supreme control, over the inhabitants for many miles around; who thought nothing of calling out their re tainers and resisting the constituted authority, Avhether it Avas that exercised by the various pachas of Acre, who, though nominally Turkish governors, were themselves quasi-independent, or the more iron rule of the Egyptian conqueror, Ibrahim Pacha, to Avhich, however, they were eventually forced to succumb. One of these families lives at a A'illage about two hours' ride from here. In response to a letter couched in the most flowery Oriental hyperbole, in Avhich my rank is exalted, my virtues are exaggerated, and the beneficent warmth which my presence is supposed to radiate is dwelt upon, I determine to shed it upon the writer of the letter; in other words, to pay him a visit in the gardens to which he has invited me. Our way lies down a Avild, romantic gorge Avhich leads to a A-alley situated among the lower spurs of Carmel, beyond the con fines of the mountain proper, Avhere the country is broken up by volcanic action into chasms and precipices, well adapted for defensive purposes, and admirably calculated to be the stronghold of a not over-scrupulous tribal chief. The village itself is situated upon a high conical mound, rising some three hundred feet above the plain; and towering above the surrounding houses is the high, two-storied, half-castel lated mansion. It is not thither that I am at present bound, but to a narrow valley about a mile distant from it, AA'hich is"], [213, "THE ARISTOCRACY OF MOUNT CARMEL. 199 wedged in betAveen frowning precipices, and is a bright green strip, in delightful contrast to the gray, overhanging crags, for it is a dense mass of orange, lemon, fig, pomegranate, olive, quince, and other fruit-trees, the result of a crystal fountain which gushes from the rock and fertilizes this fairy like scene. These are the summer gardens of my host, and from them, as he sees me approach, he issues, with several of his retain ers, and leads me to an arbour of overhanging trees, Avhose dense foliage forms an impenetrable shade against the noon day sun. Here carpets have been spread, cushions arranged, narghiles and coffee have been prepared, and the circle is formed and the comjfliments interchanged Avhich are the in- A'ariable prelude to an Eastern entertainment. Soon appear, on prancing horses, a picturesque group of men in Avhite floAving abbayes, or transparent summer robes, Avhich flutter gracefully in the wind. They are richly embroidered, and the horses are gayly comparisoned ; these are the brothers, neph ews, and other members of my host's family. One of them is a holy man, who has studied theology in the celebrated seat of Moslem learning, the College of El-Ahzar, in Cairo, and he is much respected and looked up to in consequence. Knowing that I cannot introduce a more grateful topic, and anxious to stave off as long as possible the financial one, which I suspect is in the background, I ask the dignified group of narghile smokers by which I am surrounded to tell me something of their family history. About four hundred years ago, they sayr, their ancestors came from the Hedjaz, being a branch of the tribe of Beni Ab Arabs, whose home were the deserts near Mecca, and avIio were closely related to the family of Mohammed. It is this ancestral connection Avith the Prophet Avhich has always given the family the great prestige and consideration Avhich it has enjoyed. In those days they came into the country as conquerors, and, settling themselves in their present village, soon reduced the surrounding district to subjection, and continued to rule it, nominally subject to the Pacha of Acre, but really inde pendently, until the invasion of Palestine by Ibrahim Pacha, when, after a sturdy resistance, they Avere overcome, and the grandfather of my host was executed and the greater part of"], [214, "HAIFA 200 their lands taken from them. From that time the fortunes of the family began to decline. On the restoration of the country to the sultan, by means of the intervention of Eng land, they derived no benefit. The Turkish government took care not to re-establish an influence which in former times had proved so formidable, and, indeed, one of my hosts had spent two years in prison. Some say it was because he had manifested a spirit of too great independence, but others allege that it was for the more prosaic reason of an inability or refusal to pay his debts. At all events, when the money-lending question came up, not then, but on the occasion of a return visit which they afterwards paid me, I Avas assured by those who ought to know that my picturesque, hospitable, dignified, and aristo cratic hosts Avere \u2014 Avell, I won't exactly repeat what it was said they were, but they were not just the kind of people that one would select to lend money to. This grieved me exceedingly, not because I AA-anted to lend them any, but be cause they Avere such gentlemen; in fact, I have been there since, and been very royally entertained in the old castle \u2014 Avhere the guests' room is gorgeously furnished, for this part of the world \u2014 in order to make my peace for not lending them money; for it is considered an insult, after you have been a man's guest and he asks you to accommodate him financially, if you refuse \u2014 which is perplexing Avhen he has no satisfac tory security to offer. Now, I want to keep on good terms with this powerful and fascinating and someAvhat scampish family Avithout losing my money to them, and the problem I am engaged in solving is how to do it. I have a horrible suspicion that it will yet be solved rather to their satisfaction than to mine. Under these circumstances, paying aristocratic visits does not seem likely to be an altogether profitable occupation; but they are not always attended Avith embarrassments of this nature. I have other aristocratic friends, who live about five hours distant from here. They are also originally from the Hedjaz; they also claim kinship with the Prophet, and they also once ruled a large tract of country. In fact, the tAvo families divided the Avhole of this country between them and their history has been almost identical."], [215, "THE ARISTOCRACY OF MOUNT CARMEL. 201 My visit to this family Avas in some respects highly char acteristic. My way led across the Ruhah, or \"Breezy-land,\" across open, rolling doAvns, fairly watered, and covered Avith the remains of what was once a magnificent oak forest. The trees are noAV dotted singly over it, in park-like fashion. The village itself was beautifully situated at an elevation of about seven hundred feet above the sea, on the side of a thickly Avooded mountain, tAvelve hundred feet high. On this occasion my host, Avho came out to meet me, led me to an elevated platform in front of the village mosque, an unusually imposing edifice. Here, under the shade of a spreading mulberry-tree, Avere collected seven brothers, who represented the family, and about fifty other members of it. They Avere in the act of prayer when I arrived \u2014 indeed, they are renoAvned for their piety. Along the front of the ter race was a row of water-bottles for ablutions, behind them mats on which the praying Avas going forward, and behind the worshippers a confused mass of slippers. When they had done praying, they all got into their slippers. It was a marvel to me how each knew his own. They led me to Avhat I supposed Avas a place of honour, Avhere soft coverlets had been spread near the door of the mosque. We formed the usual squatting circle, and Avere sipping coffee, Avhen suddenly eA'ery one started to his feet; a dark, active little man seemed to dart into the midst of us. Everybody struggled frantically to kiss his hand, and he passed through us like a flash to the other end of the plat form, followed by a tall negro, Avhose hand everybody, in cluding my aristocratic host, seemed also anxious to kiss. I had not recovered from my astonishment at this proceeding, Avhen I received a message from the new-comer to take a place by his side. I now found that he Avas on the seat of honour, and it became a question, until I knew who he was, whether I should admit his right to invite me to it, thus acknowledging his superiority in rank \u2014 etiquette in these matters being a point Avhich has to be attended to in the East, howrever absurd it may seem among ourselves. I there fore for the moment ignored his invitation, and asked my host, in an off-hand way, Avho he Avas. He informed me that he Avas a mollah, held in the highest consideration for his"], [216, "HAIFA, 202 learning and piety all through the country, upon which he, in fact, levied a sort of religious tax; that he was here on a visit, and that in his own home he was in the habit of enter taining two hundred guests a night, no one being refused hospitality. His father was a dervish, celebrated for his miraculous powers, and the mantle thereof had fallen upon the negro, Avho had been his servant, and Avho also Avas much venerated, because it was his habit to go to sleep in the mosque, and be spirited aAvay, no one kneAV whither, in the night; in fact, he could become invisible almost at will. Under these circumstances, and seeing that I should seri ously embarrass my host if I stood auy longer on my digni ty, I determined to waive it, and joined the saint. He re ceived me Avith supercilious condescension, and we exchanged compliments till dinner was announced, when my host asked Avhether I wished to dine alone or with the world at large. As the saint had been too patronizing to be strictly polite, I thought I would assert my right to be exclusive, and said I would dine alone, on Avhich he, Avith a polite sneer, remarked that it would be better so, as he had an objection to eating with any one who drank wine, to Avhich I retorted that I had an equal objection to dining Avith those who ate Avith their fingers. From this it will appear that my relations with the holy man were getting someAvhat strained. I was, therefore, supplied with a pyramid of rice and six or seven elaborately cooked dishes all to myself, and squatted on one mat, Avhile a few yards off the saint, my host, and all his brothers squatted on another. When they had finished their repast their places were occupied by others, and I counted altogether more than fifty persons feeding on the mosque terrace at my host's expense. Dinner over, they all trooped in to pray, and I listened to the monotonous chant ing of the Koran till it was time to go to bed. My host offered me a mat in the mosque, where I should have a chance of seeing the miraculous disappearance of the negro; but as I had no faith in this, and a great deal in the snoring by which I should be disturbed, I slept in a room apart, as exclusively as I had dined. I was surprised next morning to observe a total change in the saint's demeanour. All the supercilious pride of the"], [217, "THE ARISTOCRACY OF MOUNT CARMEL. 203 previous evening had vanished, and we soon became most amiable to each other. That he was a fanatic hater of the Giaour I felt no doubt, but for some reason he had deemed it politic to adopt an entirely altered demeanour. It Avas an other illustration of the somewhat painful lesson which one has to learn in one's intercourse with Orientals. They must never be alloAved to outswagger you."], [218, "THE JORDAN VALLEY CANAL. Haifa, Nov. 10. \u2014 In one of my former letters I described the nature of the concession Avhich had been obtained by some capitalists at Beyrout for the construction of a railway from Haifa to Damascus, and of the survey of the line, Avhich had already been completed half-way to the latter city. The matter has been the subject of a good deal of financial intrigue, and the capital which Avas sought for in London has not been forthcoming in consequence. A new element of uncertainty has just been imported into the proj ect by the agitation created by the proposal to connect the Red Sea with the Mediterranean by means of a ship canal, which, commencing at Haifa, should be cut through the plain of Esdraelon to the A-alley of the Jordan, letting the waters of the Mediterranean into the Ghor, as that valley is called, and connecting the lower end of the Dead Sea with the Red Sea by a canal which should debouch at Akaba. This project originated principally among British ship- OAvners and capitalists, Avho have hoped in this way to de stroy the monopoly which M. de Lesseps claims to possess of water communication between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea across the Isthmus of Suez. As the proposed canal does not touch the isthmus, the French company would have no ground of complaint. As, however, great uncertainty still exists as to the practicability of the scheme, a sum of \u00a310,000 has been subscribed by the promoters of the proposed company to make the preliminary surveys, and to obtain the necessary permission from the sultan to do so. According to the first accounts, his majesty set his face against any survey of the kind proposed, but the latest ad vices would go to shoAV that he has changed his mind, and it Avould seem not only that the requisite permission has"], [219, "THE JORDAN VALLEY CANAL. 205 been granted, but that the surveying party are actually on their way to Port Said. It Avill now be interesting to consider, by the light of our present information, what are the chances of success, what is the nature of the obstacles the scheme -will have to en counter, and how it proposes to overcome them, so far as they are known. In the first place, it does not follow, be cause the sultan has granted permission for the survey, that he will afterwards, supposing it to be found practicable, grant a firman for the accomplishment of the work. The advantages he will derive from it are: Easy access to his dominions in Arabia, which extend as far south as Aden; an enormous sum of money, Avhich will be paid to him in compensation for about fifteen hundred square miles of land submerged, chiefly government property, and a large annual income to be derived from tolls on the canal, and the de velopment of extensive tracts of fertile country, especially to the east of the Jordan, Avhich are noAV inaccessible and unproductive. That such a canal Avould add immensely to the resources of the empire, and be a source of great profit, there can be no doubt. On the other hand, it would almost amount to the virtual annexation of Palestine by England, whose influence in that country, backed by the enormous expenditure of capital which Avould be involved, would be supreme. It is a question, therefore, whether the sultan would consider that the pecuniary advantage Avhich he would gain Avould be compensated by the political sacrifice Avhich Avould have to be incurred. In regard to the engineering difficulties, so far as they are known, the only records of levels which Ave have of the elevation of the land between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea are those made at different times by three Frenchmen \u2014 Mons. Lartet, Mons. Vigne, and Mons. Luynes. These only differ nineteen-^get \u2014 the lowest being seven hundred and eighty-one feet, then^Jjest eight hundred; but it must be remembered that these arerfst the result of actual sur vey, but of rough estimates, and there may be depressions in the dividing ridge Avhich may have escaped these gen tlemen's observation.* The dividing ridge is said to be cal- * Since the above was written the dividing range has been carefully sur-"], [220, "206 HAIFA t careous rock \u2014 the summit level distant fifty-two miles from the Red Sea and fifty-eight from the Dead Sea, which is nearly thirteen hundred feet lower than the level of the ocean \u2014 and it is assumed that the engineering work would be facilitated by the scour which would be caused by the sea rushing down such a steep incline in a distance of one hundred miles. It is not, however, proposed to let the full force of the ocean in from this end. The operation of flooding the Jordan A-alley would be commenced at Haifa; from this point to the sea-level in the Ghor is only twenty five miles. The highest point in the plain of Esdraelon is one hundred and fifty-seven feet above the sea. Through this it is proposed to cut a canal two hundred feet wide and forty feet deep. The A'olume of Avater thus let in, it is cal culated, would be regulated to an inflow Avhich would equal about twenty Jordans, and, alloAving for evaporation, it is estimated that in fiA-e years the Dead Sea and the whole A'alley of the Jordan would be submerged to the sea-level. The effect of this submergence would be, of course, to buryT the Dead Sea under twelve hundred feet of ocean, and to create an inland sea about ninety miles long and from four to six Avide. Jericho, Beisan (the ancient Bethshean), and Tiberias would be the principal places submerged, be sides a few small \\-illages. With the exception of Tiberias, none of these are, hoAvever, of any importance. Tiberias contains a population of over three thousand, chiefly JeAvs, and a Latin and Greek monastery. Apart from the ques tion of compensating this population, and paying for the fertile lands which they occupy, a very important political question enters into consideration. The French haATe been the protectors of the Latin monastery at Tiberias from time immemorial, and the Russians occupy the same posi tion Avith regard to the Greek monastery. Are these two powers, whose interests Avould be in different ways vitally affected by the success of the scheme, likely to be induced to consent to it by any proposal of pecuniary indemnifica tion? Its success would utterly ruin the Suez Canal and almost extinguish French influence in Syria, while Russia, veyed, and the lowest part found to be between six and seven hundred feet above the level of the Red Sea."], [221, "THE JORDAN VALLEY CANAL. 207 which now aims at the annexation of Palestine and the oc cupation of Jerusalem, where her influence is at this moment greater than that of any other European nation, would find herself practically cut off from it by an inland sea, the pri vate property of her traditional enemy. In both countries the governments could appeal to the religious sentiment of the people to support them in resisting, even to a war if necessary, the flooding of the holy places at Tiberias Avhich they have guarded for so many centuries. Nor would this sentimental feeling be confined to France and Russia. Even in England and America there would be a strong objection to the Lake of Tiberias, with the historic sites of Capernaum and the other cities on its margin, which were the scenes of some of the most remarkable ministra tions of our Lord, being buried five hundred feet deep be neath the sea. Curiously enough, the project is no less keenly supported by one set of religionists than it is con demned by the other. The former pin their faith to the prophecy contained in the forty-seA-enth chapter of Ezekiel, eighth to tenth verses, Avhere it is predicted that \"fishers shall stand upon the sea from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim,\" but even this would not be the case if the scheme were car ried out, for then En-gedi would be several hundred feet below the surface of the sea. The sanguine supporters of the scheme maintain that it can be accomplished for eight millions sterling, Avhile its op ponents have entered upon an elaborate calculation to prove that the lowest figure is \u00a3225,573,648 and some odd shillings. Supposing, as seems not impossible, that the one set proA'e too little, and the other too much, if it could be done for fifty millions sterling it would pay a fair interest. The last year's receipts of the Suez Canal, Avhich cost twenty millions, were \u00a34,800,000. The whole length of the canal would be two hundred and fifty miles, of Avhich, hoAvever, only about one hundred and twenty Avould be actual cutting, but cutting of a nature unparalleled in the history of engi neering. My own impression is that, both from a political and an engineering point of view, it will be found to be impracticable; but Avho can say in these days Avhat science may not accomplish or what combinations of the Eastern question may not arise to remoAre political difficulties?"], [222, "LOCAL POLITICS AND PROGRESS. Haifa, Noat. 27. \u2014 The native population here is in a high state of excitement at neAvs which has just reached us. The government, it is reported, intends transferring the seat of the provincial government from Acre to this place. This change has been recommended on the grounds of the superior excellence of the harbour of Haifa, of its increasing export trade and rapidly growing population, and, above all, of the constantly augmenting influence of foreigners, which is the natural result of the inflow of their capital and of their in dustry and enterprise. The old fortress of Acre, at present the residence of the governor, or mutessarif, contains a population of about nine thousand, pent up within the Avails of the fort and crowded into an area of little more than fifty acres. They are for the most part fanatic Moslems, which means a state of stag nation in industry and commercial pursuits; and in conse quence of the military rule Avhich prohibits any extension of the town outside of she walls of the fortress within range of the guns, no expansion is possible to the inhabitants. The population of Haifa, on the other hand, is increasing Avith great rapidity, and the place seems to resound from one end to the other with the clink of the stone-mason's chisel, as new houses spring up in all directions. These considerations would not alone, however, account for the resolution at which the government seems to have arrived. Three fourths of the population of Haifa are either Roman or Greek Catholics; in other words, they are under the pro tection of the French Consul when religious questions are concerned; and the policy of the French government in Syria has been to extend its religious protectorate into political and secular matters, to a degree which is constantly giving rise to awkward questions and complications not devoid of danger."], [223, "LOCAL POLITICS AND PROGRESS. 209 A great part of the house property in the town of Haifa is owned by the monks of Mount Carmel, Avho consider the whole of Carmel, from the monastery at the western ex tremity of the mountain, to their chapel at the Place of Eli jah's Sacrifice at the other end, as a sort of private preserve, and push their religious pretensions to such an extreme that they look Avith the utmost jealousy upon any foreigner who attempts to buy land in the mountain, and oppose any such proceeding Avith all their energy. The policy of the Turkish government, on the other hand, is to prevent any foreigners buying land there, or, indeed, anywhere else in Palestine, although they are entitled to do so by treaty; and in pursuit of this policy the local authori ties are instructed to throw every obstacle in the way of foreign enterprise of all descriptions, but especially to render it impossible for persons not subjects of Turkey to acquire landed property. They have, on these grounds, used their utmost endeavors to ruin the Jewish colony of Zimmarin, which is also in the neighborhood of Haifa, by prohibiting the colonists from building houses for themselves, on the ground that they have no right to the land. They have based this claim on the allegation that the proprietor of the property, who was an Austrian Jew, in Avhose name it was bought for the colonists, died childless, and, according to Turkish law, landed property reverts to the Turkish govern ment under these circumstances; and the government there fore claimed the property. It so happened, however, that the OAvner did not die childless. Indeed, I knoAv his son my self, but the government refused to admit the evidence of any but Moslems as to Avhether he had a son or not, a de mand which, as the deceased proprietor did not live in Tur key, it was naturally impossible to comply Avith. The ques tion has therefore been pending betAveen Baron Rothschild, Avho took over the property on the death of its nominal proprietor, and the Turkish government for nearly two years; but I understand that permission has at last been obtained for the erection of houses by the colonists, and the affair has been arranged. The fact, hoAvever, that foreign questions are constantly arising at Haifa, either out of French pretensions or the 14"], [224, "HAIFA 210 claims of the German or Jewish colonists, and that no such questions are possible at Acre, where there is but a limited Christian or foreign population, has rendered it desirable in the eyes of the Governor-general of Syria to suggest the removal of the governor of the district to this place. The change has not yet been sanctioned at Constantinople, and the inhabitants of Acre, where property will suffer an im mediate depreciation, haA-e been pouring petitions into Con stantinople to protest against the change, urging as a reason that they, who were loyal and devoted subjects of his majes ty, will suffer; while the population of Haifa, composed principally of Christians and foreigners, will benefit. It is just possible, however, that the government may consider that the loyalty and devotion of the petitioners form the best reasons why the governor should be moved to a place Avhere the loyalty and devotion of the people, are not so assured, and should therefore be watched. At all events, there can be no doubt that the change, should it take place, will cause an immediate rise in the value of property here, and that there will be a considerable influx of people from Acre to this town, which has the advantage in summer of being a much cooler and more agreeable place of residence. Meantime, advantage has been taken of this opportunity to remove the present governor and replace him by a more intelligent and active functionary, a change Avhich has caused great satisfaction, both to Moslems and Christians, as, in spite of his fanaticism, he had contrived to make himself very unpopular with the former, Avhile he altogether failed to keep the peace at Acre between the rival sects of the lat ter, who, though A'ery limited in number, were constantly engaged in broils. Moreover, it is not the habit of the Turkish government to retain its functionaries, under any circumstances, long at the same post. The only drawback to Haifa as the new seat of govern ment is its limited water supply. At present the town de pends entirely upon its wells, and although an abundance of water can be found at a trifling depth, it is usually a little too brackish to be altogether palatable. Under these circum tances it became of the utmost importance, in view of the proposed change, to try and find a spring, sufficiently copi-"], [225, "LOCAL POLITICS AND PROGRESS. 211 ous and near the town to be utilized, and it occurred to a friend and myself that such a one might exist at Rushmea, Avhere are the ruins of an old Crusading fort, which I have described in a former letter, distant about an hour's ride from the town, at an elevation of about seven hundred feet above the level of the sea. There is a well here called the Well of Elias, into Avhich I once descended, and found that it Avas supplied with Avater which entered through a tunnel in the rock, but had no outlet; and the shepherds told me that, hoAvever much they watered their flocks, the water always remained at the same height, while in winter, although the Avell was eight feet deep, the Avater rose in it so high as to overflow the mouth. Under these circumstances it Avas evident that the well was, in fact, a sort of back-water of some underground stream or rivulet, which found a subter ranean channel for itself. This Ave determined, by excava tion, to try and discover. We therefore commenced digging near the well, and about two feet from the surface struck the roof of a subterranean aqueduct. Uncovering this, we found that the channel had become silted up with mud, which required to be removed. We then found that we were in an arched tunnel, the sides of which Avere roughly built with stone, while the floor was paved Avith the same material, in Avhich a channel had been cut, but it was four inches higher than the water in the Avell. We were therefore obliged to take it up, cutting, altogether, a trench thirty yards long and eight feet deep. On drawing the Avater off by means of this channel, we uncovered the mouth of the tunnel, by which it entered, sufficiently to send in a man with a light. After wading through the mud for a few paces, he came upon a vault beautifully cemented, thus proving that in ancient times the stream had been utilized. It Avould have involved a greater expense, how ever, to clear out than I Avas prepared to incur, unaided by the community for Avhose benefit it Avould have inured. As it was, the stream thus discovered was almost sufficient in volume to be Avorth conveying to Haifa, a distance of three miles, and could doubtless be much increased. In the course of our excavations we came upon several large blocks of square stone, which had formed part of the ancient tunnel."], [226, "212 HAIFA The project of the railway from Haifa to Damascus, the concession for which had lapsed in consequence of the com bined greed and apathy of the first grantees, is now revived under more favorable auspices, and I have little doubt that the change of the seat of the government to this place will give it a renewed impetus, so that before long it will be car ried out. Meantime, unwonted energy is displayed by the govern ment in improving our communications. Having occasion a feAv weeks ago to ride to Beyrout, I saAV the surveyors at work tracing out a line for a carriage road to connect that important city with Haifa. The distance is about eighty miles, and there are no serious engineering difficulties in the way. This road is sadly needed, especially now, when, owing to the cholera in Europe, no steamer touches here on its way to Beyrout, although we are visited once a fortnight by one coming from that place after it has performed there a quar antine of five days. The habit, unfortunately, of the gov ernment of making the road, and postponing to an indefinite period the construction of the bridges, goes far to neutralize its good intentions. The towns through which the road passes are heavily taxed, and then, owing to the Avant of bridges, it is useless for a great part of the year. Should this road be completed, Beyrout, Damascus, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Nazareth, Haifa, Tyre, and Sidon will all be connected by roads over which stages could run; and this would go far to facilitate travel in Palestine, and enable tourists to dispense with that system of tenting which now renders it so sIoav and expensive."], [227, "THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANCIENT SITES. Haifa, Dec. 13. \u2014 The researches which I haA'C been mak- ing into the oldest authorities, with the view of identifying the sites of the numerous ancient towns that once formed the homes of the extensive population Avhich in ages long gone by inhabited this coast, have only served to reveal to me the enormous difficulty of the task. This difficulty is created partly by the confusion introduced by the crusading nomenclature and traditions, partly- by the inaccuracy of the itineraries of early pilgrims and travellers, and to the dis- crepancies existing in the most primitive maps, and the con- tradictions in historical records. Thus between this place and Tantura, a distance of fifteen miles, I have visited the ruins of no fewer than nine ancient toAvns or villages, some of them of considerable size, not one of Avhich, Avith the ex- ception of Tantura, which is the Biblical Dor, has been posi- tively identified. I do not include in these the ruins of towns a mile or more inland, AA-hich Avould double the num- ber and convey some idea of the denseness of the popu- lation which once inhabited this section of the country. At the same time it is possible, from the A'aried character of these ruins, that some were far -more ancient than the others, and that they may have existed as traces of a still more early people, when other cities, also noAv in ruin, Avere rich and flourishing. Thus Ave have on this coast remains of the early Ph\u0153nician period, of the Greek period, of the Ro- man or Byzantine period, and, lastly, of the crusading period \u2014 the latter too modern to be of any arch\u00e6ological interest. They consist merely of constructions built from the mate rials of the civilizations which had preceded it. Not con tent with using up these materials, the crusaders gave the towns and forts which they built wrong names, refusing to adopt the Saracen nomenclature, which Avas generally a cor ruption of the original Canaanitish or Hebrew, and attempt-"], [228, "214 HAIFA. ing to identify them according to their own ideas of Bibli cal topography, or reading of Roman history, thereby intro ducing inextricable confusion. Thus Ave have William of Tyre, one of the crusading historiographers, gravely inform ing us that \"Duke Godfrey de Bouillon awarded, Avith his usual magnanimity, to the generous and noble Tancred the city of Tiberias, on the Lake of Genasereth, as well as of the Avhole of Galilee and the sea-tOAvn of Kaypha (or Haifa), which is otherwise called Porphyria.\" The Carmelite monks still cling to this tradition, although modern research has proved beyond a doubt that the site, at all events of one Roman city of Porphyrion, was at Khan-Yunis, a ruin, eight miles north of Sidon, and at least seventy miles from Haifa. To escape this difficulty some have supposed there Avere two Porphyrions, and that one was here, basing their argument on the fact that in the Ono masticon of Eusebius and Jerome there is a city marked at the point of Carmel, called Chilzon, and that Chilzon is the Hebrew for the murex, or shellfish which produced the pur ple dye found there in great quantities; hence Porphyrion, or the purple city. In carefully examining these ruins, and remarking the great quantity of carved porphyry Avhich is peculiar to them, I have thought it furnished a stronger argument in favor of what Avould seem an appropriate appellation. The crusaders even confounded the Sea of Galilee Avith the Mediterranean ; thus they supposed a connection to exist between the tOAvn of Caiapha, or Caiaphas (the modern Haifa), Avhich Benjamin of Tudela asserts to have been founded by Caiaphas, the high-priest, and Cephas, the Greek name of Simon Peter. Hence near Haifa the crusading clergy showed the rock where Simon Peter fished, called to this day Tell el-Samak, or the Mound of the Fish. Laboring under a similar con fusion of idea, they built a fort out of the ruins of a place called at the present day Kefr Lam, a name Avhich, no doubt, dates back before the times of the crusaders, and which they twisted into Capernaum, that place being, as Ave all know, on the Sea of Galilee. The Capernaum of the crusaders, however, is a village on the Mediterranean shore, thirteen miles down the coast from here. ."], [229, "THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANCIENT SITES. 215 The itineraries of the pilgrims and early travellers are scarcely less perplexing. They are generally careful to re cord the distances betAveen the various places they visit, but rarely Avith accuracy. Their remarks, however, are naive and amusing. I have just been reading the journal of a certain Antoninus, the Martyr, who travelled in Palestine about the year a.d. 530. Writing of Tyre, he says: \" The city of Tyre contains influential men ; the life there is very wicked ; the luxury such as cannot be described. There are public brothels, and silk and other kinds of clothing are woven.\" We do not altogether see the connection in this last sen tence. Going on, he remarks: \" Thence we came to Ptolemais (the modern Acre), a respectable city, where we found good monasteries. Opposite Ptolemais, six miles off, is a city which is named Sycaminus, under Mount Carmel. A mile from Sycami nus are the hamlets of the Samaritans, and above the hamlets, a mile and a half away, is the Monastery of Heliseus (or Elijah), the prophet, at the place where the woman met him whose child he raised from the dead. On Mount Carmel is found a stone, of small size and round, which, when struck, rings because it is solid. This is the virtue of the stone \u2014 if it be hung on to a woman, or to any animal, they will never miscarry. About six or seven miles off is the city of rorphyrion.\" Noav there are as many mistakes as there are sentences in this quaint account by the holy man. It is a matter of dis pute which are the ruins of Sycaminus. Two ruins claim that honor, and one of these it undoubtedly is. They are only two miles apart, but the nearest is thirteen miles from Acre, instead of six, and the other fifteen. A mile from Sycaminus, he says, are the hamlets of the Samaritans. These have been identified beyond all doubt as a ruin called Kefr es Samir, two miles and a half beyond one of the above mentioned ruins, and four miles and a half beyond the oth er. The Monastery of Heliseus, the prophet, \" a mile and a half away,\" I have described in a former letter. It is the picturesque gorge and ruin called Ain Siah, but the place where Elijah met the woman of Sarepta was, if we are to believe the Bible, \"at the gate of that city,\" at least fifty miles distant from Carmel. There is no doubt as to its site, between Tyre and Sidon. As to \" the stone of small size, which, when struck, rings because it is solid,\" it happens to"], [230, "216 HAIFA ring because it is hollow. I have an interesting collection of these geodes, found near Ain Siah, their peculiar shapes having given rise to the legend that they were melons and other fruits Avhich the proprietor refused the prophet Avhen he was hungry, and Avhich the latter therefore blasted with petrifaction. And then comes the final statement about the unhappy Porphyrion, which he puts six miles off, thus probably identifying it with Athlit, and making confusion worse confounded. First Ave have the Jerusalem Itinerary, distinctly placing it to the north of Sidon, a position con firmed by other authorities; then Ave have William of Tyre identifying it with Haifa, and now Ave have Antoninus put ting it six miles off. I Avill not inflict upon you all my reasons for coming to the conclusion that the ruin at Tell el-Samak, the Mound of the Fish already alluded to, is the site of Sycaminum, though I doubt whether a larger population did not inhabit the city two miles nearer Haifa, where the porphyry fragments abound. To judge by the fine carvings at both places, they must have been wealthy as Avell as populous, and their most prosperous period was in all probability during the first three or four centuries of our era. The coins which I haA*-e found so far are of that epoch. Exploring the ruins of what must have been the upper tower of Sycaminus, dis tant about four hundred yards from the Fish Mound, and two hundred feet above it, a few days ago, I came upon a cistern Avith four circular apertures. Upon being let down into it I found it was seventy feet long, hewn out of the solid rock, twenty feet broad, and tAvelve feet high from the debris at the bottom, but in reality much deeper. The roof was supported by three columns, four feet square, also hewn from the living rock. The cement was still in some places perfect, and the cistern must have been capable of contain ing a vast supply of Avater. It was about fifteen yards from an angle of a Avail composed of rubble, from Avhich the ash lar had been removed, about four feet thick, and still stand ing in places to a height of four feet. In others the foun dations of this Avail were easily traceable. As the Avhole ruin seems to have escaped the observation of the Palestine Ex ploration Survey, I measured it, and found the east wall to"], [231, "THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANCIENT SITES. 217 be one hundred and twelve yards long, the south wall sixty five, the Avest Avail seventy, and an intersecting wall forty. I could find no traces of a north Avail. It Avas probably a fortress, which was supplied by the cistern already men tioned. In the neighborhood Avere some fine rock-cut tombs, two with six loculi, each in a good state of preservation. I also picked up a piece of Avhite marble on which Avas an in scription in early Arabic characters, but only the word \"Al lah \" and two or three more letters remained on the frag ment. At Kefr Lam, the crusaders' Capernaum, which I had oc casion recently to visit, I discovered tAvo very remarkable vaults, each forty feet long by tAvelve broad and seven high. The roof was supported by five arches, each arch composed of a single stone four feet broad, on the top of which huge flat stones had been laid. I have ncA'er seen any construc tions like these vaults, and think they probably dated from a very ancient period. In the immediate neighborhood the peasantry had recently opened an ancient Avell, thirty-five feet deep, the Avater being approached by a flight of steps round tAvo sides of the Avell, the shaft of which Avas about thirty feet square. There were no feAver than seventeen handsome rock-cut tombs in the neighborhood of the vil lage, and I regretted that I had not time to prolong my in vestigations, as I feel convinced that the vicinity would repay examination. As it is, I have obtained from the vil lagers several good specimens of terra-cotta lamps, two curi ous alabaster saucers, some coins, and other antiquities."], [232, "THE SEA OF GALILEE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST. Haifa, Dec. 26. \u2014 In reading the works of Dr. Kitto and other writers who have endeavoured to present a picture of the manners and customs of the population which inhabited Palestine in ancient times, I have been much struck by the erroneous impressions which the descriptions of those Avrit ers are calculated to convey in many important respects. This has arisen from the fact that while they have portrayed, with tolerable accuracy, the rude civilization of the original inhabitants and the subsequent civilization grafted upon it by their Jewish conquerors, they have left out of consider ation the changes Avorked upon, and the modifications intro duced into, the social conditions thus produced by that still higher and later civilization which resulted from Greek and Roman invasions. Thus while they carefully trace back the habits of the modern fellahin, and show that they differ slightly from those of the peasantry of the country in the time of Christ, and invoke the testimony of modern Bedou ins as evidence of a mode of life which has undergone no perceptible alteration since the days of Abraham, they leave out of account altogether that magnificent Roman and By zantine civilization, traces of which still exist in such abun dance as to astound the traveller Avith its splendor and its richness, but which has passed aAvay like a dream, leaving nothing behind but the coarse barbarism Avhich has suc ceeded it, and which is almost identical in character Avith what it supplanted. Hence it is that these writers have found those resemblances betAveen the modern and ancient manners and customs of the inhabitants of this country by which they were so much struck, and Avhich they have given to the public as furnishing an accurate picture of Avhat an cient Palestine was like. We are so much in the habit of confining our interest in"], [233, "THE SEA OF GALILEE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST. 219 this country to its history before the time of Christ that it Avill probably strike many with surprise to learn that the most flourishing epoch of its history was subsequent to that time; that never before had the arts and sciences reached so high a pitch; that never before had its population been so wealthy and luxurious, its architecture so grand, its com merce so flourishing, and its civilization generally so ad vanced. It is true it had lost its independence, and Avas only a Roman province, but it is just because it Avas one, and not a Jewish kingdom, that our impression of its act ual condition at the time of Christ is apt to be so erroneous. This fact has been very forcibly brought to my notice in a recent trip which I haAre made along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, more especially along its little-explored northern and eastern coasts, where the evidences of the Avealth and luxury of the former inhabitants still remain in unexampled profusion. In reading in the Gospels the narrative of the works and life of Christ, so much of Avhich Avas spent upon the shores of the lake, in one of the cities of which he for some time took up his abode, most of us have endeavoured, probably, to picture him to ourselves amid purely Jewish surroundings and conditions closely resembling those Avhich we have been in the habit of associating with that previous period of Jewish history with Avhich Ave are familiar in the books of the Old Testament. So far from that being the case, the part of the country in which his ministrations were principally exercised, Avas beyond all others a centre of Ro man life, Avith all its luxurious accompaniments. Nowhere else in Palestine Avas there such a congeries of rich and populous cities as were crowded round the shores of this small lake. Nowhere else could the JeAvish reformer come into closer contact Avith the rites of a Avorship alien to his own. On the shores of this lake might be seen temple after temple rearing their vast colonnades of graceful columns, their courts ornamented with faultlessly carved statues to the deities of a heathen cult. Here were the palaces of the Roman high functionaries, the tastefully decorated villas of rich citizens, with semi-tropical gardens irrigated by the copious streams which haAre their sources in the"], [234, "HAIFA. 220 plain of Genesareth and the neighbouring hills. Here were broad avenues and populous thoroughfares, thronged Avith the motley concourse which so much wealth and magnifi cence had attracted \u2014 rich merchants from Antioch, then the most gorgeous city of the East, and from the Greek islands, traders and visitors from Damascus, Palmyra, and the rich cities of the Decapolis; caravans from Egypt and Persia, Jewish rabbis jostling priests of the worship of the sun, and Roman soldiers SAA-aggering across the market places, where the peasantry were exposing the produce of their fields and gardens for sale, and where fish was dis played by the hardy toilers of the lake, among whom were those Avhom the Great Teacher selected to be the first re cipients of his message and the channels for its communica tion to after ages. Thus it was, as I rode along the margin of the sea the other day, that I Avas enabled to repeople its shores in imag ination by the light of the remains Avith Avhich they are still strewn, and, overtaken in its desolation by the shades of night, to fancy its now gloomy shores ablaze with the scin tillations proceeding from the lamps of at least a dozen large cities, and the almost continuous street of habitations Avhich connected them, and to illuminate its now dark and silent waters Avith countless brilliantly-lighted boats, skim ming over its smooth surface, containing noble ladies and gallants on their Avay to or from scenes of nocturnal festiv ity, or indulging in moonlight picnics, with the accompani ments of Avine and song and music. That life in these cities Avas profligate and dissipated in a high degree Ave may gather from Christ's denunciation of Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Ca pernaum, Avhich he declared to be so much more wicked than Tyre or Sidon, or even Sodom, that it would be more toler able in the day of judgment for those cities than for the three he was denouncing. That among these Capernaum Avas the one of the greatest splendor, and was puffed up therefore with the pride of its OAvn pomp and magnificence, Ave may gather from the indignant apostrophe: \"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven.\" It may have been because he considered this city the wickedest, as it ap pears to have been the largest on the lake, and therefore"], [235, "THE SEA OF GALILEE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST. 221 the most in need of his ministrations, that he chose it for some time as his residence. Hence it came to be called \" his own city.\" This circumstance invests it with a special interest in our eyes. Unfortunately, a violent contest rages between Palestin ologists, if I may be allowed to coin the word, as to the exact site of Capernaum. The two places which claim this honor are now called Khan Minich and Tell Hum respect ively. Until lately the weight of opinion Avas in favor of the former site; latterly the researches of Sir Charles Wil son, on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, have con vinced that accomplished arch\u00e6ologist and careful explorer that the true site of this celebrated city is to be found at Tell Hum. It would Aveary my readers if I Avere to quote all the texts relied upon by the disputants to maintain each hypothesis, supported by calculations of distance, the ac counts of Josephus, and of early pilgrim or Arab travellers. The subject has been pretty Avell thrashed out, but I doubt whether it is even yet exhausted. I incline strongly to the Tell Hum theory, but as Khan Minieh comes first on our Avay as Ave glide from Tiberias to the head of the lake, as it is unquestionably the site of what was once a city, and as it is a highly picturesque spot, and one, moreover, full of Bib lical interest as being, if not Capernaum itself, within three miles of that city, and therefore a spot Avhich must have been the scene of some of Christ's labours, I -will begin by describing it. The plain of Genesareth, the unrivalled fertility and luxu riance of Avhich, though it is now uncultivated, I described in a former letter, when I crossed it eighteen months ago on my Avay to Safed, is terminated at its northern extrem ity by a mountain range, Avhich projects in a lofty and precipitous crag into the lake, and renders any passage round it by land extremely difficult. This projection forms a little bay, or rather rush-grown lagoon, running back into the head of the plain. Into it falls a small stream, powers ul enough, hoAvever, to turn a mill. It is this building and the ruins of an ancient khan near it, A\\Thich was itself construct ed from the remains of an ancient city about three hundred yards distant, Avhich is now called Khan Minieh. The true"], [236, "222 HAIFA site of the old city is not, however, where the khan now stands, but not far from a fountain, shaded by an old fig tree, from which the fountain takes its name \u2014 Ain el-Tin, or the Fountain of the Fig-tree, Avhich suggests the idea that either the name is very new or the fig-tree very old. A plentiful supply of water Aoavs from it, slightly brackish, with a temperature of 82\u00b0 Fahrenheit. The water is croAvd ed Avith fish and surrounded Avith green turf. It appears to be one of the seven fountains mentioned by Theodorus, a.d. 530, as being two miles from Magdala, the city of Mary Magdalene, in the direction of Capernaum. Near this fountain are some old foundations and traces of ruins, but these for the most part cover a series of mounds where a few walls are visible, but no traces of columns, capitals, or handsome blocks of stone, and much smaller in extent than those of Tell Hum. Indeed, the whole area is not more than tAvo hundred yards long by one hundred broad, and this is one reason for supposing that it cannot be the site of that important city. The khan itself is at least as old as the twelfth century, being mentioned by Bohaed din in his life of Saladin. A road from here leads up the steep hillside to Safed. The view from it, as we ascend to some elevation above the plain, is A-ery beautiful. That fer tile expanse which Josephus calls \"the ambition of nature,\" lies stretched at our feet, Avith the Avaters of the lake rip pling upon its pebbly beach, Avhile we look right up the gorge of Hammam, its beetling cliffs on both sides towering in rugged cave-perforated precipices to a height of twelve hundred feet above the tiny stream Avhich, compressed be tween these lofty walls of limestone and basalt, Avinds its way to the lake. But it is not up the wild mountain-side that our present way lies; so, taking our last look at the crumbling Avails of the old khan, at the picturesque water-mill, the ruin-strewn mounds, and the grassy lagoon-, we prepare to skirt the rocky flank of the ledge which here dips into the waters of the Sea of Genesareth, and by which Ave hope to reach the ruins of Bethsaida."], [237, "THE SCENE OF THE MIRACLE OF THE FIVE LOAVES AND TWO SMALL FISHES. Haifa, Jan. 6, 1885. \u2014 If, as I stated in my last letter, stu dents of Biblical topography have been much exercised in their minds as to the identification of the ruins on the north- Avest shore of the Sea of Galilee, Avhich indicate the site of the once famous city of Capernaum, and have applied not only a great amount of antiquarian research and of time in the way of minute local examination and literary labor in the hope of definitely settling this knotty point, there is an other upon which they have no less anxiously expended their ingenuity. This is to solve the vexed question as to AA-heth er there were, in the time of Christ, tAvo Bethsaidas or one. This question Avould never have arisen but for the confusion introduced into the scriptural narrative by the puzzling ac counts given in all the four gospels of the miracle of the feeding of the multitude with five loaves and two fishes, the scene of Avhich the four evangelists are unanimous in de scribing as having been in a desert spot which must have been on the eastern side of the lake, for immediately as ter- Avards \" they crossed over to the other side,\" arriving at Capernaum, which Avas on the Avestern side. But according to one (Luke) this desert place (on the eastern side) be longed to a city called Bethsaida ; and according to an other (Mark) Christ, after the miracle, \"constrained his disciples to get into the ship and go to the other (or western) side before, unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.\" Hence the confusion; starting from the Avestern side, they take ship, cross over to a desert place belonging to Beth saida; the miracle is performed there, and the disciples are constrained by their Master to take ship and cross the lake back again to Avhat must be another Bethsaida. Then the storm arises, he comes to them on the waters, and they final ly reach Capernaum in safety."], [238, "224 HAIFA. Reland, the learned geographer of the last century, was the first to invent the second Bethsaida on the Avestern side, Avhich is not mentioned by either Josephus or Pliny, the latter of Avhom distinctly puts it on the eastern side; and I have not been able exactly to discover upon Avhat authority Reland hit upon this easy solution of the problem. The only historical Bethsaida of which we have any certain rec- ord Avas a place at the northeastern extremity, originally a village, but rebuilt and adorned by Philip the Tetrarch, and raised to the dignity of a town under the name of Julias, after the daughter of the emperor. Here, in a magnificent tomb, Philip was himself buried. On the other hand, Ave have indications of the existence of another Bethsaida in the mention of a Bethsaida which was the birthplace of Peter and AndreAV and Philip, Avhich Mark tells us was \" in the land of Genesareth,\" and therefore on the west shore of the lake. Supposing Tell Hum to be Capernaum, and the -western Bethsaida to be on the site usually assigned to it, this hypothesis would give us two Bethsaidas only six miles apart, not a very probable supposition; or else we have to suppose that the land of Genesareth extended across the Jordan to the east side, which we know to have had another name, and to have been in another province; or to suppose, as Dr. Thomson \u2014 who resolutely refuses to have two Bethsaidas \u2014 does, that half the town was on one side of the Jordan and half on the other, and that the half on the Avest side Avas called Bethsaida in the land of Genesareth, though the plain of that name is five miles distant. More- over, there are no ruins conveniently placed to support the presumption, Avhich is Arery strained. Altogether the sub ject is one which has puzzled eA-ery Biblical geographer hitherto, and, after a careful examination of all their argu ments, I find myself just as much in the dark about it as when I entered upon the investigation. As, therefore, after visiting all the disputed localities, I do not feel any the more competent to enlighten your readers, I will confine myself to describing the different places which have been suggested as the sites of these cities, as Avell as of others which I vis ited in the section of country to the east of the Jordan, some of which I was the first to discover, and none of Avhich have been positively identified."], [239, "SCENE OF MIRACLE OF LOAVES AND FISHES. 225 Meantime, the scene, which the tradition of many centu ries located erroneously as the spot upon Avhich the miracle took place, is exactly above us as Ave Avind along a rocky path cut in the precipice which overhangs the Sea of Gali lee. This huge impending crag is croAvned by an artificial plateau, which is tAvo hundred feet long by one hundred broad, and in the northwest angle are the remains of a Avail and the ruins of a building, probably a fortress of some sort. This spot Avas known in the middle ages as the Mensa Christi, or Table of Christ. In olden time the great Damascus high-road ran just below, and the fort above doubtless com manded this pass; but it has become impassable, and the path now folloAvs the channel of an aqueduct hewn out of the living rock. For about Iavo hundred yards we find ourselves riding along the narrow floor of this ancient watercourse. On our left the smooth rock rises precipitously, and on our right it forms a wall from three to four feet high, over which we could drop a stone perpendicularly into the Ava ters of the lake. The aqueduct which thus forms our sin gular roadway is about three feet wide; emerging from it, after avc turn the angle of the rock, avo find ourselves over looking a little bay, into Avhich rushes a brawling torrent, the largest Avhich enters the lake excepting the Jordan, and which here turns a mill. It is, however, only a few yards long, as it bursts from the ground in great force, in what is by far the most poAverful spring in Galilee, and is, without doubt, the celebrated Fountain of Capernaum mentioned by Josephus as watering the plain of Genesareth. This it did by means of the aqueduct Avhich we had already traArersed, the distance from the fountain to the plain not being above a mile. Besides the principal fountain, which is estimated as being more than half the size of the celebrated source of the Jordan at Banias, there are four smaller fountains, all more or less brackish, and varying in temperature from 73\u00b0 to 86\u00b0. One of the special subjects of interest connected with these fountains is the presence in them of the remarkable fish called the coracinus. The only knoAvn habitats of this fish in the Avorld are in the Nile, in a fountain which I have also visited in the plain of Genesareth, called Mudawara, and in 15"], [240, "HAIFA 226 this spring. Josephus accounts for its existence here, as well as in the Nile, by a hypothetical subterranean water communication Avith the great river of Egypt. Modern geologists point to it as an evidence of the fact that in some long bygone period Palestine might have been included in a great Ethiopian basin. However the circumstance is to be accounted for, it is most remarkable, and was doubted until Canon Tristram A'erified it tAventy years ago by a someAvhat singular experience. Crossing the little stream Avhich issues from the fountain of Mudawara and Aoavs into the lake, and Avhich happened to be Arery low at the time, he was surprised to observe a quantity of fish wriggling along in single file, and so close together that the mouth of one touched the tail of the one before it. In places there Avas so little water that they had to flop across intervals of almost dry land; here he caught them easily with his hand, and, as many averaged three feet in length, he was not long in making a good bag. What surprised him most, hoAvever, was to find that as soon as he laid hold of one it began hissing and screaming like a cat. Making a bag of his cloak, he car ried them off in triumph to his camp, which was three hours distant,' and could hear them hissing and caterwaul ing in it all the way. He describes them as being a most delicious fish to eat, something like an eel in flavor, and possessed of extraordinary vitality, as some of them Avere still living after they had been tAvo days out of the water. The last volume just issued by the Palestine Exploration Fund contains a print of this extraordinary creature, which has a long, slender body, apparently not much thicker than that of a good-sized eel, Avith two long fins, one on the back and one on the belly. The mouth, Avith its long, cartilagi nous streamers (I do not know the ichthyological term for them), somewhat resembles that of a catfish. I unfortunately had no means of fishing for them on the occasion of my visit, and they did not happen to be migrating to their spawning grounds, which they were evidently doing when Tristram caught them; but my late experiences on the shores of the lake have been so full of interest that I propose to make another visit in the spring, Avhen I hope to go supplied with tackle, and to give you my own piscatory experiences."], [241, "SCENE OF MIRACLE OF LOAVES AND FISHES. 227 There is a small tract of fertile land in the rear of the mill, but no ruins except those connected Avith mills or wa ter-works. Nevertheless, it is impossible almost to conceive that a position so favored by nature should not have been the site of a town, and it is on this spot that many geogra phers place the western Bethsaida. There are no apparent grounds for their doing so beyond the necessity of finding a spot somewhere which should support their hypothesis. If, hoAvever, they must have a second Bethsaida, I should rath er put it a mile farther off, at Khan Minieh, instead of so very close to Capernaum as this Avould be, ahvays supposing Tell Hum to be Capernaum, Avhich is only tAvo miles distant from this spot. Dr. Thomson's theory that El-Tabghah, the modern name of this place, Avas the grand manufacturing suburb of that large city, from Avhich its fountain took its name, seems to me rational. Here Avere the mills, not only for it, but for all the neighbourhood; so also the potteries, tanneries, and other operations of this sort Avould be clus tered around these great fountains, a theory somewhat borne out by the name, Tabghah, which resembles the Arabic word Dabbaga, meaning tannery. There is no doubt that in this neighbourhood somewhere, probably on the plain of Genesareth, Avas the location of a town far older than any of those whose sites Ave are now dis cussing, and this is the Chinneroth mentioned in the Old Testament, from Avhich the lake, in days long anterior to those of Christ, took its name, and which the Talmud ren ders Ginizer, which is therefore doubtless identical Avith Ge nesareth. Indeed, it may be noted as a curious fact, Avhich has been forced upon me by these investigations, that the towns noticed in the Gospels, excluding the large cities, such as Jerusalem, Tyre, and Sidon, are almost all places not mentioned in the Old Testament. Nazareth and Caper naum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin and Tiberias are names never occurring in the HebreAv Scriptures; and the scenery of the life of Christ lies, as a rule, apart from the centres, religious or political, Avhich reappear again and again in the earlier episodes of Jewish history."], [242, "CAPERNAUM AND CHORAZIN. Haifa, Jan. 20. \u2014 Perhaps the most interesting spot in the Avorld to those deeply under the influence of that charm which association lends to places hallowed by the ministra tions of the Founder of Christianity is to be found in a des ert, rock-strewn promontory on the northwest shore of the Lake of Tiberias; for among these piles of hewn blocks of black basalt still remain the ruins of a great synagogue, Avith in whose walls, the foundations of which may still be dis tinctly traced, Avere collected the multitudes who flocked to hear the teaching of Christ. While modern tourists resort in crowds to Jerusalem to visit the mythical sites Avhich are supposed, upon the vague basis of ecclesiastical tradition, to be identified Avith episodes in the life of the great Teacher, scarcely one ever finds his way to this remote locality lying just out of the beaten track along which Cook leads his herds of sightseers; and yet it is probable that the greater part of that period in the life of Christ, the record of which is contained in the four Gospels, was spent at Capernaum, which the most careful im-estigation, by the highest author ities in such matters, has identified with these ruins of Tell Hum, amid which I was just now standing. Here it was that Christ cured Peter's mother-in-laAA*-, restored the para lytic, called Matthew, cured the centurion's servant, raised Jairus's daughter from the dead, and obtained the tribute of money from the mouth of a fish. It was here that he spoke the parables of the sower, the tares, the treasure hid in the field, the merchant seeking goodly pearls, and the net cast into the sea. Sir Charles Wilson, whose researches on this spot led him to identify it as being the site of the city of Capernaum, believes this synagogue was, \"without doubt, the one built by the Roman centurion (Luke vii. 51), and, therefore, one of the most sacred spots on earth.\" It was"], [243, "CAPERNA UM AND CHORAZIN. 229 in this building, if that be the case, that the well-knoAvn dis course contained in the sixth chapter of John was delivered; and it was not without a strange feeling, says the same ex plorer, \"that, on turning over a large block, avc found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words: \"I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead.\" This very synagogue was probably the scene of the heal ing of the demoniac and of the delivery of many of those divine lectures on faith, humility, brotherly love, and for mality in worship, as Ave read at the end of one of them: \"These things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.\" Perhaps it Avas in the little creek, where a boat Avas now riding at anchor only a few feet from the shore, that Christ taught the people from the boat so as to avoid the crush of the multitude. It was doubtless in one of these inlets that James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, were mending their nets when, being called, they left their ship and followed him; and it was on this coast that Andrew and Peter Avere casting their nets Avhen they were summoned to become fishers of men. It has a high er claim to be called the birthplace of the religion which has since revolutionized the world than any other spot upon it; and it is a matter of some surprise to me that neither the Greek nor the Roman Catholic churches, in their zeal to discover holy places, Avhich may serve as levers for political intrigue, have yet thought of occupying this one, which would seem the holiest of all. Perhaps it would lead to a comparison betAveen their practice and the teaching of which it Avas the scene, Avhich might give rise to some inconvenient reflections. Apart from their associations the ruins themselves are not particularly striking. They cover an area of about half a mile in length by a quarter in breadth, and consist chiefly of the black blocks of basaltic stone Avhich formed the walls of the houses. The traces of the synagogue, hoAvever, re main sufficiently for the building to be planned. Built of Avhite limestone blocks, it must have formed a conspicuous object amid the black basalt by which it was surrounded. It Avas seventy-five feet by fifty-seven, built north and south,"], [244, "230 HAIFA. and at the southern end had three entrances. Many of the columns and capitals have been carried away, but enough still remain to convey some idea of the general plan and aspect of the building. The capitals are of the Corinthian order, and there were epistylia that rested upon the columns and probably supported wooden rafters. There are also re mains of a heavy cornice and frieze. The exterior was prob ably decorated with attached pilasters. Two miles north of Capernaum are the ruins of Chorazin. There is no difficulty in identifying the site, Avhich may be determined partly by the itineraries of early travellers, and partly by the similarity of the modern name, Kirazeh. The path to them leads up the sloping, rocky hillside, but, owing to the peculiar character of the masonry, which is barely to be distinguished at one hundred yards from the rocks which surround it, the extent and importance of these ruins have been overlooked until quite recently. They coA-er an area as large as, if not larger than, those of Capernaum, and are situated partly in a shallow valley, partly on a rocky spur formed by a sharp bend in the Wady Kirazeh, here a Avild gorge eighty feet deep. From this spot there is a beautiful view of the Lake of Tiberias to its southern end; and here, too, are gathered the most interesting ruins \u2014 a synagogue with Corinthian capitals and niche-heads cut, not, as at Ca pernaum, in limestone, but in hard black basalt. The di mensions of this building are about the same as those of the one at Capernaum, but the interior is a mass of ruins. Two pedestals still remain in situ, and a portion of the wall. The characteristic of this synagogue is an excess of ornamenta tion of rather a debased kind. The niches are most elabo rate, and remain as sharp as when they were cut in the hard material used. The mouldings of the door-posts are similar to those used in other synagogues, and there are many stones cut Avith deep mouldings and pieces of classical cor nices strewn among the ruins. Many of the dwelling-houses were until recently in a toler ably perfect state, the Avails being in some cases six feet high ; and, as they are probably of the same class of houses as that in which Christ dAvelt, a description of them may be inter esting. They are generally square, of different sizes, the"], [245, "CAPERNA UM AND CHORAZIN. 231 largest, however, not over thirty feet square, and have one or two columns doAvn the centre to support the roof, which ap pears to have been flat, as in the modern Arab houses. The walls are about two feet thick, built of masonry or of loose blocks of basalt. There is a Ioav doorAvay in the centre of one of the Avails, and each house has AvindoAvs twelve inches high and six wide. In one or two cases the house Avas di vided into four chambers. We now pushed on to the point where the Jordan enters the lake, distant about three miles, for it was only on the other side of that river that my exploration of new ground might be said to commence. I had been attracted hither by rumours which had reached me of a remarkable stone which AA'as said to be in the possession of an Arab, on Avhich were pictorial representations and inscriptions. As my informa tion on the point Avas somewhat vague, I rode up to a Bed ouin encampment, near which Avas also a collection of mud hovels occupied by fellaheen, Avhich were situated on the Avest bank of the river. They Avere naturally so suspicious that I pretended at first to be merely anxious to have a guide to sIioav me the ford, but it Avas not until the old sheik himself appeared that I could find any one willing to offer me the slightest assistance. They gazed at me Avith open-mouthed stupidity, real or assumed, and the sight of silver scarcely moved their stolidity. Far different Avas it Avith the eagle-eyed old gentleman Avho, having seen the group assembled round us, strode up from the Bedouin en campment, and at once entered into the spirit of the thing. Not only Avas he prepared to show me the ford, but, for ade quate consideration, Avould take me to all the ruins in the neighbourhood, with the positions of Avhich he professed an accurate acquaintance, if I would only Avait until he went for his horse. This I Avas only too happy to do, and in a feAv minutes he galloped up with his kufiha and abbaye fluttering in the Avind, a genuine son of the desert. We forded the Jordan by following the little bar Avhich it makes on entering the lake, the Avater reaching to our saddle-flaps, and, following the shore, here a grassy plain for half a mile, reached a large square building, charmingly situated near some trees on the margin of the Avater. This Avas the gran-"], [246, "HAIFA 232 ary and storehouse of the great Arab proprietor of the neighbourhood, the only building with any. pretensions for miles round; and it Avas the local agent of this man, himself a resident in Damascus, Avhom I now found to be in posses sion of the relic I had travelled so far to see. My disap pointment may be easily conceiA-ed when I Avas told that ho had gone to Damascus, and Avould not return for a week. My disgust, as I squatted beneath the walls of this detesta ble building, making a lunch off hard-boiled eggs, and re volving burglarious schemes of entry, all of Avhich came to naught, may easily be imagined. The fact that the build ing itself was surrounded by ruins Avas small consolation, for these consisted only of large hewn blocks of black basalt, and the foundations of houses which were clearly to be traced, but the area they covered was not extensive, and I could not find any indications of any public building. The name of the spot is El-Araj, which signifies The Lame, but I was unable to identify it Avith any Biblical locality."], [247, "DISCOVERY OF. AN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE. Haifa, Feb. 2. \u2014 I narrated in my last letter the disappoint ment I experienced Avhen, after making a pilgrimage to the north end of the Lake of Tiberias for the express purpose of seeing some stones covered with inscriptions and pictorial representations, said to be in the possession of the agent of a rich Arab proprietor, I found their owner gone and the relics locked up in a building of which he had taken the key, and all ingress to Avhich Avas impossible. The Bedouin sheik Avhom I had picked up as a guide at a neighboring encamp ment, seeing my chagrin, comforted me by the assurance that if I would only follow him he would take me to a place where I could find others which were quite as good. I mounted my horse, therefore, in someAvhat better spirits, as from his description of the locality I knew it must have escaped the attention of all former travellers, and consoled myself by the reflection that a discovery of some importance might still be in store for me. Our Avay took us due north across the fertile plain of the Buteha, an alluvial expanse about tAvo miles in length by one in breadth, formed by the detritus which, in the course of ages, has been washed doAvn the Jordan, and the winter torrents Avhich rush into the plain down the wadya that descend from the elevated plateau of Jaulan. The Buteha is not unlike the plain of Genesareth. Both are Avell watered and extremely fertile. Buteha has the largest and most prominent brooks, Genesareth the most numerous and abundant springs. The old traveller, Burck hardt, says that the Arabs of the Buteha have the earliest cucumbers and melons in all this region.

It has, indeed, been very rarely visited, but it is considered by many to be the site of Bethsaida-Julias and the scene of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. At present all we know for certain is that one of the Bethsaidas Avas some where in the Buteha; that Josephus in his descriptions ad vanced it to the dignity of a city, both by reason of the number of inhabitants it contained and its other grandeur; and that inasmuch as the plain of the Buteha contains many heaps of ruins, none of any very great extent, any of them may be Bethsaida, while if it were a large city in our mod ern acceptation of the term, the Avhole plain Avould not be large enough to contain it. Indeed, one is much struck in exploring the ruins of the country by the limited areas which they cover. I am afraid to say how many sites of ruined towns I have A-isited in Palestine, certainly not less than forty; and I think one could crowd them all into the area occupied by the ruins of one large ancient Egyptian city \u2014 Arsinoe in the Fayoum, for instance ; but then the ruins of an Egyptian city are composed mainly of mounds of potsherds, while these con sist of large blocks of building stone, either limestone or basalt, measuring generally tAvo feet or two feet six one way, and a foot or eighteen inches the other. Then they are usually comparatively near together; all around the Lake of Tiberias, and in the country in its vicinity, they are gen erally not more than from one to three miles apart; so that this section of country must have been very thickly peopled. The ruins of Et-Tell are now built over by the Arabs, who live in a squalid village among the basalt blocks which formed the mansions inhabited by the more highly civil-"], [249, "DISCOVERY OF AN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE. 235 ized race which occupied the country in the days when all this region Avas the favourite haunt of Christ and his dis ciples. Leaving Et-Tell on our left, we folloAved the east bank of the Jordan for more than a mile. This river is here very rapid, and, splitting into numerous streams, whirls past the small islets they form. It is the very ideal of a trout stream, on Avhich on some more propitious occasion I propose to cast a fly. Meantime, even had I been provided Avith the requisite tackle, I should have been obliged to forego the temptation. It was on the steep rise of a hill, about a hun dred yards from the river, that my guide suddenly stopped. Here Avas a small collection of Arab hoATels, recently con structed, and it was in their search for stone, last summer, that the natives had for the first time uncovered the ruin which iioav met my delighted gaze. I found myself in the presence of a building the character of which I had yet to determine, the Avails of Avhich Avere still standing to a height of eight feet. The area they en closed Avas thickly strewn Avith building-stones, fragments of columns, pedestals, capitals, and cornices. Two at least of the columns were in situ, while the bases of others were too much concealed by piles of stone to enable me to deter mine their original positions. My first impression, from the character of the architecture Avhich Avas strewn about, Avas that this Avas formerly a Roman temple; but a further and more careful examination convinced me that it had origi nally been a JeAvish synagogue, which at a later period had been converted to another use; probably it had been ap propriated by the Byzantines as a basilica, or Christian church. This Avas the more probable, as the existing AA-alls had evidently been built upon the foundations of a former structure. The massive stones were set in mortar, which is not the case with the synagogues hitherto discovered; and I should doubtless have been completely at fault in classing this building had my attention not been already directed to the remains of the synagogues brought to light recently by the exertions of the Palestine Exploration Fund. I Avasnow fortunately in a position to compare the dimen-"], [250, "HAIFA 236 sions, ground-plan, and architectural fragments which Avere strewn about, with those Avhich distinguish the synagogues already discovered, in regard to whose original character there can be no doubt, as the Hebrew inscriptions and sacred Jewish symbols carved on the lintels prove it. The build ing measured forty-five feet by thirty-three, Avhich is exactly the measurement of the small synagogue at Kefr-Birim. The columns were exactly of the same diameter. The floor was depressed, and reached by a descent of two steps, Avhich Avere carried around the building in benches or seats each a foot high, the face of the upper one ornamented by a thin scroll of floral tracery. These features occur in the syna gogue at Irbid. There was a single large stone cut into the shape of an arch, Avhich had evidently been placed on the lintel of the principal entrance, like the one Avhich stands to this day over the doorway of the great synagogue at Kefr- Birim. The niches, Avith the great scallop-shell pattern Avhich distinguishes them, almost exactly resemble those of the synagogue of Kerazeh or Chorazin; while the cornice, which was extremely florid, and not unlike what in modern parlance is called \" the egg-and-dart pattern,\" though differ ing in some respects from the cornices hitherto observed, was evidently of the same school of design. The capitals were two feet three inches high, and Corinthian, in the same style and of the same dimensions as those of the small syna gogue of Kefr-Birim, and there was the upper fragment of two semi-attached fluted columns, with Doric capitals, the ditto of Avhich is to be found at Irbid. The tAvo columns in situ exactly answTer in position those of several of the syna gogues, and though the position of the door, which was in the centre of the western wall, was somewhat unusual, this was accounted for by the fact that the building had been excavated from the hillside, so that the top of the east Avail, nine feet of which was still standing, Avas level Avith the sur face of the slope of the hill. The only convenient entrance Avas in the wall of the side immediately opposite to it. The name of this most interest ing locality Avas ed-Dikkeh, a spot hitherto unvisited by any traveller. Indeed, if it had been visited, it would have been passed unnoticed, for its antiquarian treasures have only"], [251, "DISCOVERY OF AN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE. 237 been revealed for the first time a few months ago. The word ed-Dikkeh means \"platform,\" a name, considering its position, not inappropriate ; but I have not been able to identify it with any Biblical site. The area of ruins apart from those of the synagogue itself was not very large, but the situation was highly pict uresque. Half a mile to the north of Avhere we stood the Jordan forces its Avay through a gorge Avhich I hope some day to explore, while immediately beloAV us it rushed be tween numerous small islets. Opposite the hills swelled gently back from its Avestern bank, behind us they rose more abruptly to the high table-land of Jaulan, while to the southward stretched the plain of Buteha, with the Lake of Tiberias in the distance. Meantime the feAV Avild-looking natives who inhabit this remote locality clustered around me, as they watched me measuring and sketching, with no little suspicion and alarm. \" See,\" said one to another, \" our country is being taken from us.\" My request for old coins only frightened them the more. They vehemently protested that not one had been found, an assertion which, under the circumstances, I felt sure was untrue; nor did the most gentle and reassuring language, with tenders of backshish \u2014 which was neverthe less greedily accepted \u2014 tend to allay their fears. I have forgotten to mention Avhat was perhaps the most interesting object of all, and this Avas the carved figure of a Avinged female Avaving what seemed to be a sheaf in one hand, while her legs were doubled backward in a most uncomfortable and ungraceful position. It was on an isolated slab about six inches thick, and tAvo feet one way by eighteen inches the other. The area of the hillside all around Avas streAvn Avith the blocks of building-stone of which the town had been built. It had apparently not been a A-ery large place, but as the villagers will probably continue their excavations for their own purposes next summer, it is not at all unlikely that they may bring some more interesting remains to light. I ear nestly impressed upon them the necessity of preserving these, promising another visit next year, Avhen I Avould reAvard them in proportion to the carvings, coins, or other antiqui-"], [252, "HAIFA. 238 ties they could provide for me; but they listened to my ex hortation with such a stupid and suspicious expression of countenance that I did not derive much encouragement from their reluctant consent."], [253, "CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RUINS OF SYNAGOGUES. Haifa, Feb. 16. \u2014 I described in my last letter the discoA' ery of the ruins of an ancient Jewish synagogue at a spot on the east bank of the Jordan, about three miles north of the upper end of the Lake of Tiberias. As the question of ancient Jewish synagogues is one of great interest, in re gard to which considerable misapprehension prevails even among arch\u00e6ologists, I may be excused for entering upon a short disquisition upon the subject, as I am not aware that the great light which has been thrown upon it by recent Palestinian research has yet been distributed in a popular form to the general public, and the old and recognized au thorities are often misleading. For example, \"Smith's Dic tionary of the Bible \" contains a long article on Jewish syna gogues which has hitherto been considered the great author ity on the subject, in Avhich I observe that it states under the sub-head \"Structure:\" \" Its position, however, was determined. It stood, if possible, on the high est ground in or near the city to which it belonged. Its direction, too, was fixed. Jerusalem was the Kibleh of Jewish devotion. The synagogue was so constructed that the worshippers, as they entered and as they prayed, looked towards it.\" This may have been the case in respect of the earlier syn agogues, long anterior to the time of Christ, the traces of Avhich have been lost, but in the case of eleven which have been discovered by the officers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, since the above was written, no such rules have been adhered to. These all date either from the time of Christ, or shortly before it, to three centuries after it. We know they were synagogues, and can approximately calculate their dates, from the HebreAV inscriptions found on some of them, and from the emblems with which they were orna-"], [254, "HAIFA 240 mented, such as the pot of manna, the seven-branched can dlestick, and other purely Jewish devices. In the cases of these synagogues, many of which I have seen, the builders have by no means selected the most prominent positions ; the existing remains have, with two exceptions \u2014 at Irbid and at ed-Dikkeh, where the ground Avould not admit of such an arrangement \u2014 their doors on the southern side, so that every JeAV entering would have to turn his back on Jerusalem. The ark, if there Avas one in these synagogues, would neces sarily, in that case, be placed at the northern end, and the Avorshippers would therefore have to pray with their backs to Jerusalem. We knoAV, besides, hoAv abhorrent to the Jews Avere the figures of animals, and the popular impression has been that none such Avere permitted to decorate their synagogues; yet in these synagogues we find them prominently carved in stone in six out of the eleven. The carved figure I found at ed-Dikkeh makes a seventh, and they probably existed in the others and in greater quantities than those already noted, but have been destroyed by the Mohammedans as contrary to their religion. As may be supposed, as they were all built at nearly the same period, there is a great similarity in the architecture of the synagogues recently discovered. It is of an extremely florid and someAvhat debased Roman type. In all of them the same class of mouldings is observa ble. There is a great resemblance in the niches and cornices, Avhile the capitals show some variation, being Corinthian, Doric, and Ionic. There is also a great similarity in the ground plan and in the position of the columns. In the case of a Roman temple these are all in colonnades outside the building, in cases of synagogues they are all within it. There should be no possibility, therefore, of confusing a syn agogue Avith a Roman temple, even though it abounds with Roman architecture; but it is not ahvays so easy to distin guish it from an early Christian church, or basilica, Avhere the columns were also inside. The reason that the archi tecture of these latter synagogues was so purely Roman in character is to be found in the conditions under which they were built. Shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish Sanhedrim was established at Tibe-"], [255, "CHARACTERISTICS OF RUINS OF SYNAGOGUES. 241 rias, under a patriarchate whose authority was recognized by the foreign communities at Rome and in Asia Slinor, and large numbers of these came to live in the district, Avhile alms poured into the treasury at Tiberias from all di rections. It thus became very wealthy, and the centre of a great Jewish population. It Avas recognized by the Romans, and by them granted many indulgences, and, during the reign of Antoninus Pius, a.d. 138-161, increased in poAver and influence. At the beginning of the third century the Jews were in high favor Avith the Emperor Alexander Severus, who was even called the Father of the Synagogue, and this name may have been given him from his influence over the erec tion and architecture of these buildings. It seems, there fore, almost a certainty that the Roman emperors aided and inspired the erection of these synagogues. They were built by Roman labor, for the Jews, being immersed in commer cial pursuits, by using Roman workmen, obtained much finer results than we are led to think they Avould themselves have been capable of. No synagogues of the kind have been found in other countries, though there Avere many in Baby lon and in the colonies of the Jews, and this type has never been perpetuated in later works, while Ave have seen how many points in their religion Avere disregarded in their de sign and ornamentation. We may therefore suppose that they were forced upon the people by their Roman rulers at a time Avhen they Avere completely submissive to their power, and directly they were able they deserted such pagan build ings as a disloyalty to their religion. It is stated that Rab bi Simon, son of Jochai, is the founder of many of these buildings. Indeed, it is related that he built Avith his own money twenty-four synagogues in this part of the country. As he was a most fanatical teacher of the law, it is evident that if he erected so many buildings in such violent contra diction to many points of his own religion, he must have done it under great pressure. These synagogues built un der Roman auspices were probably only an alternative evil; they had to choose between having them or none at all. With the exception of one on Carmel, and a problematical one at Shefr-Amr, about six miles from Haifa, all the syna- 10"], [256, "242 HAIFA gogues hitherto found have been within the immediate lim its of Avhat was formerly the patriarchate of Tiberias. The fact that the building at ed-Dikkeh would be included in this district is an additional reason for assuming it to have been one of this class of synagogues, and, if so, we should probably be accurate in fixing its date at someAvhere in the first or second century after Christ. From ed-Dikkeh I proceeded under the guidance of the old sheik, who Avas much pleased at the satisfaction which I evinced at his successful leadership thus far, in an easterly direction to another place, Avhere he assured me that the villagers had also been at work getting out stone during the summer, and had unearthed some more old ruins. Our way led us along the flank of the Jaulan hills, with the plain of the Buteha on our right, and, after a ride of about an hour, Ave reached a village of huts, in the midst of which Avas the anticipated excavation. I could not quite expect such an other stroke of luck as that Avhich had befallen me at ed- Dikkeh, but yet I had no reason to be dissatisfied. Here, upon a terrace built of large blocks of basalt about five inches in height, I found a curious condition of things. The villagers had laid bare, eighteen inches beloAv the surface of the earth, the cement floor of an old chamber about twenty feet in one direction. I could not tell hoAv far it Avent in the other, as it was still covered with earth, but Avhere it abruptly termi nated it revealed, about eighteen inches beneath, another floor of some building of much older date, across Avhich it had been built diagonally. This floor was of stone. It, too, had been cleared for some distance by the natives, and upon it Avas standing, at intervals of six feet apart, five solid cubes of stone, measuring two feet each way, which had probably been the foundations or loAver stones on which had been placed the pedestals of columns. As this loAvest floor was three feet below the present surface of the ground, the top of these stones was one foot below it, and the line of them may have continued, though only five had been uncovered. I have no means of conjecturing what the building may have been. I found many fragments of columns and capi tals strewn around among the ruins, which covered a larger area than those at ed-Dikkeh, and which, like them, are a new"], [257, "CHARACTERISTICS OF RUINS OF SYNAGOGUES. 243 discovery, though what its results may be must depend very much upon further excavation. I impressed upon the vil lagers here, as I had already done at ed-Dikkeh, if, in the course of their excavating for stone, they came upon any with inscriptions or pictorial representations, to preserve them; but I felt, as I did so, that my Avords fell upon deaf or rather unwilling ears. They gazed at me with alarmed stolidity, either not understanding or not caring to under stand, and evidently dominated by the fixed impression that my proceedings implied in some way the future ownership of the soil. I looked from here wistfully up a valley, at the mouth of which this ruin was situated, and at the head of which others were reported to exist, but circumstances pre vented me at the time from pushing my explorations in this direction. Indeed, travel in this part of the country is at tended with many difficulties, some political and some mate rial, among the latter the chief one being, if one is unpro vided with a tent, the question of Avhere one is to spend the night. If, on the other hand, one is provided with a tent, it involves a much larger retinue, increased expense, excites even more distrust among the natives, and becomes some times dangerous from arousing their cupidity, and this ne cessitates having guards and escorts, which are the cause of endless quarrels and annoyance, as the more people you have with you the less are you your OAvn master to go Avhere you like, and the more difficult it is to provide for man and beast. It is a choice of evils at best of times, and the worry and dis comfort can only be compensated for by good luck in ob taining results, and this is by no means always to be secured, though thus far on this particular journey I had had no rea son to complain. I now propose to tempt fate on the high lands to the east of Lake Tiberias, with what success remains to be seen."], [258, "A NIGHT ADVENTURE NEAR THE LAKE OF TIBERIAS. Haifa, February 28. \u2014 The tourist who follows the ordi nary track of Palestine travel from Jerusalem to Damascus inevitably passes Tiberias. Standing on the flat roof of the convent, where, if he is not one of a Cook's party, he is com pelled to lodge, he has a splendid view of the lake and of the precipitous cliffs opposite, which descend abruptly to its margin from the elevated plateau behind, that averages tAvo thousand feet above the level of the lake. That sheet of Avater being nearly eight hundred feet below the sea-level, the only engineering problem Avhich presents itself to the consideration of the surveyors Avho have been engaged in tracing a railroad line betAveen Haifa and Damascus is how to ascend from this depression to the highlands above. The solution of the problem is to be found in a large wide valley called the Wady Samak, which is exactly opposite Tiberias, and up the unknoAAm recesses of Avhich our tourist looks with longing eyes. Practically this wady is a sealed book to the Palestine traveller. To explore it he would have to obtain special permission from the government, Avith a guard, and be exposed to all manner of extortion from his dragoman, who would take advantage of his ignorance to magnify the dangers and add to the already existing ob stacles. Indeed, one of the most singular characteristics of Palestine travel is the close proximity of unknown and un explored districts to beaten tracks. Just as it often happens in a large city, that in the immediate neighborhood of one of the most frequented thoroughfares there are back slums inhabited by thieves and criminals, into which no respectable person penetrates, so, in Palestine, Avithin ten miles of a place like Tiberias, there are spots as yet untrodden by the foot of the explorer; but these are all to the east of the lake"], [259, "NIGHT ADVENTURE NEAR THE LAKE OF TIBERIAS. 245 and of the Jordan. Almost every inch of western Palestine has succumbed to the exhaustive researches of the Palestine Exploration Fund. It Avas on a gloomy winter afternoon that I found myself skirting the eastern shore of the lake Avith the view of at tacking the mysteries of this interesting valley \u2014 interesting from a practical point of view, because I wanted to look at the possible gradients which it might offer for a railway, and still more interesting from an arch\u00e6ological point of vieAV, because I felt sure that in searching for gradients I should find ruins. But the search Avas undertaken under difficulties. I Avas Avithout a tent, because my journey par took of the nature of an exploratory dash, and a tent Avould have been an encumbrance. I Avas without a guide, because my guide had deserted me in consequence of one of those misunderstandings Avhich are not uncommon betw-een travel lers and their guides; but I had tw-o companions, baggage animal and servant, and an amiable soldier, upon Avhom, in case of trouble, it was supposed Ave should be able to rely for protection and aid. OAving to a variety of causes, principally arising from a desire to find ruins Avhere there were none, and to map cer tain Avadys Avhich are incorrectly laid doAvn in the maps, we were about tAvo hours later than Ave should have been when we reached the mouth of the wady. The clouds were lower ing ominously, there had been no sun all day, and now that luminary seemed to have given up the attempt to shine upon us in despair, and to have made up his mind, in a fit of dis gust, to retire permanently to rest. I felt, considering the journey up the unknoAvn wadyT, which Ave still had to perform without a guide before I could hope to reach a resting-place (I did not look forward to its being much of a sleeping place), that it had no business to get dark so early. Hoav ever, it was still broad daylight, and we took our bearings by compass as carefully as was possible, and were encouraged by observing that the track Ave were on was a broad and well-beaten one, and Avhich, as the formation AVas AA-hite lime stone, would show plainly even when it got dark. The val ley I knew to be about seven miles long. The village Ave were bound for, the only village in it or near it, Avas at its"], [260, "HAIFA. 246 head. We had only to keep going straight up, and the path Ave were on would surely lead us to it. This fond delusion I hugged to my soul as we pushed on as rapidly as our wearied steeds, which had been travelling since daybreak, would allow us. The breadth of the valley in a bee-line from one edge of the plateau above us to the other was not less than two miles. It Avas a broad A'alley, with many shoulders running into it from both sides, and terraces here and there of cultivated land, the crops the property of wandering Bedouins, who come here in winter to soav them, and come back in spring to gather them. Down, the centre of the valley braAvled, over a rocky bed, a mountain brook, even in the dryest season a respectable trout stream, and often after heavy rains an impassable tor rent. On the present occasion, however, it Avas behaving itself respectably, and gave us no trouble. It was fringed with oleanders, and here and there received tiny tributaries, which all helped to produce more vegetation than is usual in Palestine valleys, and to enhance the beauty of scenery the natural features of which were strikingly picturesque. As long as it Avas light I could see natural terraces on the flanks of the valley, up which it would be easy to take the line. Then I saw where long curves must be taken, winding up lateral hollows, through which Ave could twist the line up the two thousand feet it had to ascend, and lengthen out the seven miles of the wady to a distance which would suffice for the required gradient. Assuredly AA'hen that long-looked-for and much-to-be-de sired line is made, the stretch up the Wady Samak Avill be one of the most romantic and interesting sections upon it, Avhile its well-Avatered slopes will doubtless tempt the specu lative agriculturist or stock-farmer to intrude upon domains noAV appropriated by a few wandering Arabs, whose scantyr flocks might be increased tenfold without consuming half its pasture, and who do not cultivate a tithe of its fertile soil. While thus indulging in airy imaginings of the future, darkness gradually closed in, and I became suddenly aware, as so often happens in this Avorld, that all my calculations Avould haAre been sound in regard to my finding my way if they had not been based upon thoroughly delusive premises."], [261, "NIGHT ADVENTURE NEAR THE LAKE OF TIBERIAS. 247 The cause of my error may be summed up in the one word, basalt. I had forgotten one of the most remarkable geo logical features of this part of the country, and this is, that only the loAver stratum of the range Avhich rises from the east shore of Lake Tiberias is of limestone. All the rest is basaltic, and this formation is of vast thickness. The Avhole of this district is, indeed, an immense volcanic field, consist ing of irregular heaps of amorphous lava and disintegrating scori\u00e6, with mounds of globular basalt. So that when dark ness came on everything below me, as well as all above, seemed suddenly to have become as black as night. The path had disappeared as if by magic, and I called a halt, and Ave found ourselves on a patch of black rock, Avith exactly similar patches of black rock all around us. The outlines of the hills had vanished, the path had led us up from the bed of the torrent, so Ave no longer had that to guide us. To at tempt to descend to it Avould haA-e been madness, as Ave might have fallen over a precipice in the darkness; indeed, Ave were afraid to move, except with extreme caution, in any direction. We had a compass and matches, and kneAV that by keeping due south Ave might, if no accident befell us, and the rocks permitted a passage, ultimately reach the plateau; but Ave also knew that the direction of our night-quarters Avas due east; but here Ave ran the greater risk of tumbling into un known transverse gorges Avith precipitous cliffs. We cau tiously worked south, but our progress soon became barred by thorny brushwood, and Ave had to face the alternative of a night out-of-doors without water or anything to drink, and a very limited supply of food. We were just bracing ourselves to this unpleasant pros pect, Avhen, in a soutliAvesterly direction, Ave suddenly saw a gleam of light; it lasted for a moment, then seemed to go out. But that one ray was one of hope, and we steered cau tiously for it. We had been scrambling by compass in the dark for about half an hour, and were just beginning to de spair, Avhen the bark of a distant dog put neAV energy into us, and not long after, around the shoulder of a hill, Ave came upon an encampment, and were greeted by the furious yells of the mob of noisy curs which infest the tents of the Bed ouins. It was a startling apparition to burst upon these"], [262, "248 HAIFA. nomads in their remote retreat \u2014 horsemen of a type they had never seen before, and an armed soldier. Such children as were awake set up a dismal squalling, the women coAvered tremblingly over their camp-fires under the pent roof of black camels' hair. All the side of the tent being open, its Avhole internal economy Avas exposed to view, and enabled us to judge of the slight protection in the way of bedding or clothing or covering of any sort Avhich was provided against the inclemency of the season. Meantime the men had gathered round us, half timidly, half threateningly. The presence of the soldier suggested fear and suspicion, Avhile the smallness of our party encour aged the bolder ones to look defiant. As far as I could make out in the darkness these were about a dozen tents here in all \u2014 apparently the fag end of an insignificant tribe Avhose name I forget. It was at first impossible to induce any one at that late hour to act as guide. Even abundant offers of backshish failed to shake their suspicion, which was to the effect that Ave Avished to decoy one into durance to act as a hostage until some arrears of taxes Avhich they OAved the government should be paid up. The other alternative was that Ave should take up our quarters in the sheik's tent, whether he liked it or not, which, Avith a piercing wind blowing, accompanied by sleet, was not a very pleasant prospect. He seemed to relish it as little as we did, and finally consented to be our guide as Ave made some silver gleam in the firelight. As he seized his eighteen foot lance and mounted his ragged steed he looked like some Arab Don Quixote; and as the camp-fire threAV its ruddy gloAV upon a group of wild-looking women, with dishevelled hair and tattooed chins, crooning over a pot like the Avitches of \" Macbeth,\" and upon barelegged men, as they flitted to and fro between the black tents, I thought I had seldom gazed upon a more weird and unreal-looking scene. How our guide could find his way up the rocky hillside and across the prairie remained a mystery during the long two hours that Ave followed him. Of this I feel sure, that we scrambled up places in the dark that Ave should never have thought of facing by daylight. The very horses seemed to have become desperate, and to have abandoned"], [263, "NIGHT AD VENTURE NEAR THE LAKE OF TIBERIAS. 249 themselves to their fate. At last we dismounted and scaled the rocks like goats, every one, man or beast, doing the best he could for himself on his OAvn account, and so at last, Avearied and half-starved, for we had fasted for about ten hours, avc reached the goal of our endeavour, too tired to see what an utterly miserable hole it was. I passed a wretched night in a room in the middle of which a fire had been built, Avhich filled it Avith smoke, for it had no other exit but the door, Avhich it was too cold to keep open. Around the fire were stretched fifteen Arabs, Avho quarrelled with a government official, Avhom they were compelled to entertain, about their taxes, until they exhausted themselves, and then they exchanged their discordant Avrang ling for no less discordant snoring. After replenishing ex hausted nature with the eggs which was all that my host could provide me Avith, and a tin of canned meat, I vainly tried to follow their example, but Avas too busily occupied in scratching to think of anything but fleas, and so tossed and tumbled and longed for the morning, Avhen I proposed to enter upon a neAv field of exploration, for this Avas the village of El-Al, where I had heard that ruins existed; and as I had every reason to believe that in ancient times this neighbourhood had been the centre of a large population, I felt sure that they had left interesting traces, Avhich Avere yet to be discovered."], [264, "KHISFIN. Haifa, March 15. \u2014 There is no part of ancient Palestine which offers a more fertile field for antiquarian research than that portion lying to the east of the Jordan, Avhich fell to the share of the half-tribe of Manasseh. In Biblical times a part of it was called Golan, and its modern name of Jaulan is almost identical with its ancient appellation. It is to this day the finest grazing land in all Palestine, as it was in the days of old, when Job fed his vast flocks and herds upon its more eastern pastures, but it is now very sparsely inhabited. The sedentary population has all been driven away by the Avandering tribes of Bedouins Avho haA-e appropriated the country; the very few villages that remain are squalid and miserable, and the inhabitants live in terror for their lives, for they never know Avhat day, or rather night, the Arabs may not be down upon them, and carry off their stock. They surround their houses, therefore, with large yards en closed by stone walls, and it Avas in one of these that I found a lodging on the night that I had so nearly been obliged to spend in the wilds of the Wady Samak. Attached to these yards are large stone vaults, capable of containing great herds of cattle, and some of them apparently of great an tiquity. In the one in Avhich I staked my horses I found, on examining it in the morning, part of a Corinthian column, still in situ, standing to a height of about six feet. I failed to discover any more, but the vault Avas so dark that mv examination was carried on with difficulty, and I had no time to spend over it. The sheik's house in Avhich I lodged, and to which this vault belonged, Avas evidently, however, built on the site of what had formerly been a building of some im portance, for in the yard, to my surprise and delight, I came upon a prostrate statue of a woman, life size. The head Avas severed from the body, and the feet had been broken off at"], [265, "KHISFIN. 251 the ankles, but it was a fine specimen of Greek statuary. Both the features and the drapery were beautifully executed. The feet I found in situ, the ankles just appearing on a level Avith the ground. On clearing this away I laid bare the feet, which Avere still firmly fixed on the original pedestal, which it would have required a great deal of labour to disinter. It is not improbable that the pedestal is covered with carving in basso relievo, and I promise myself at some future time to dig it up. In the meantime both feet and pedestal cannot be safer than where they are, more especially as my com panions secured the head. This the sheik was induced to part Avith for $3. The body was too cumbersome to carry away now, as a camel would have been needed for its trans port, and, as it is not of much value without the head, it may be considered secured by the possession of that portion. The statue apparently represented Artemis, as the left arm clasped what seemed to be a quiver for arrows. The right arm Avas unfortunately broken aAvay, othei-wise the statue would be perfect when put together. The pedestal, Avithout doubt, contains an inscription describing the statue and the goddess represented upon it. I was sorely tempted to de vote a day to its examination, but, in that case, I should have been compelled to give up visiting some other spots of interest which had never before been investigated, and the hardships and discomforts of these preliminary dashes into the Avilds, more especially in the depth of winter, are so great that one is not tempted to prolong them \u2014 my present object being rather to know where to go at some future time, Avhen the conditions, political and otherwise, may be more favourable than they are noAV. I therefore did not linger longer than was absolutely necessary at this place. I had seen enough to prove to me that it Avould, in all probability, amply repay a fuller investigation, and I determined with out delay to push on to a village called Khisfin, Avhich I Avas extremely anxious to examine, as it has hitherto escaped the careful attention of all former travellers. And yet, from the records Avhich I have been able to examine in regard to it, it must have been a place of considerable importance in medi\u00e6val history, though hitherto my efforts to trace it back to an earlier date than the beginning of the tenth century"], [266, "252 HAIFA or to identify it with any Biblical site have been in vain. Yakubi, an Arab geographer, who lived about the year 900 a.d., mentions it as one of the chief towns of the province of the Jordan. In his day Syria was divided into three prov inces, namely: The province of Damascus, the province of the Jordan, and the province of Palestine. Yakut, in the thirteenth century, mentions it as a town of the Hauran dis trict, below Nawa on the Damascus road, betAveen NaAva and the Jordan. Khisfin was also at one time a fortress of the Saracens, as it is further mentioned as the place to which Al Melek Al Adil, Saladin's son and successor, fled after having been routed at the battle of Beisan by the Crusaders, who advanced upon him from Acre. As it is mentioned as being one of the chief towns of the province, so long ago as 900 a.d., it is probable that its importance dates from a much older period, as indeed was indicated by some of the ornamentation which I found there. Securing my host, the sheik, as a guide to a locality Avhich promised to be so full of interest, Ave started at a brisk pace across the plateau, in the teeth of a bitterly cold east Avind and driving sleet, and, after riding an hour, came to the ruins of Nab, situated on a small mound. They consist of blocks of basalt building-stone, some traces of foundations, some fragments of columns and capitals, and a tank, dry at the time of my visit, but which evidently held Avater at some time of the year. It had, apparently, been much deeper at a former period, only the two upper courses of masonry being now visible. It Avas oval in shape, and measured sixty yards by thirty. This place does not appear to have been pre viously visited or described. Shortly after leaving it I ob served masses of black stone, which, on nearer approach, proved to be the walls of a fortress that, my guide told me, was Khisfin itself. It loomed strikingly up from the grassy plain, and gaA'e rise to pleasing anticipations as I galloped impatiently up to the base of the Avails, and, jumping off my horse without even waiting to tether him, in my excitement, scrambled up a breach to see what was inside. I looked down upon a ruin-strewn area, but, alas, no columns, noi capitals, nor signs of Roman remains. This had evidently been in turn a Saracen and a Crusading construction. The"], [267, "KHISFIN. 253 outer walls measured sixty-eight yards one way by fifty-four the other. They are nine feet in thickness, and are eight courses of stone in height, the stones being from one foot to one foot six inches square; but some are much larger. Within the fort are the traces of a second or inner Avail, forming a sort of keep in the centre; but the Avhole area was too much encumbered Avith ruin for any accurate plan to be possible in the limited time at my disposal. A little beyond the fort stood the village itself. All the intervening and surrounding fields Avere thickly strewn with the large heAvn blocks of black basalt of Avhich the houses of the former population had been constructed, and which, to judge from the area which they covered, quite justified the description of Yakubi, that in his day this was one of the chief towns of the province, and the centre of a very largo population. The present squalid inhabitants, few in number, seemed to live in a perfect quarry of these old building-blocks. No difficulty had they in finding material wherewith to build their houses, their large cattle vaults, and enclosing yards. They simply piled the tumbled masses of stone in a little more regular order, one above another, to make Avails of any height or thickness they chose, with out mortar or cement, and had houses that would last for ever. As all the stones Avere beautifully squared and shaped, they had far more symmetrical walls, thanks to the ancients, than if they had been left to themselves. These black, mas sive huts all jumbled together with their vaults and yards, without regular streets or lanes, formed one of the strangest looking villages I ever saw. In some cases the Avails Avere formed of stones placed diagonally, in others horizontally, in others perpendicularly. The very roofs were of stone, Avith earth on the top of them to fill up the cracks. Where hewn stone is so abundant and wood almost impossible to obtain, it is astonishing what uses the former can be put to. And now came a search which I would willingly- have protracted over days instead of over minutes, which AA-ere all I had to give to it. To \" do \" Khisfin thoroughly one ought to examine carefully every stone in every house, be sides the acres of stones by Avhich the present village is sur rounded. As it Avas, I Avent into as many houses as I had"], [268, "254 HAIFA time for, and made sketches of Avhat ornamentation I found. The natives had evidently used as lintels for their doorways the stones which had served the ancients for the same pur pose. These were usually four or even five feet long, and many of them Avere ornamented Avith curious devices. They were in part Crusading and in part Saracenic. There were the tablets with half-effaced escutcheons, rosettes, bosses, crosses, and other Crusading emblems, Avhich left no doubt in my mind that this must have been at one time an impor tant Crusading fortress, though in the only book relating to the crusades Avhich I happen to have by me no mention is made of it. There were several of those curious carvings, difficult to describe, which characterize Saracenic architec ture as an evidence that the Moslem conquerors of the cru saders had also had a hand in its adornment; but what Avas more interesting, there were floral wreaths and carved de vices which are a feature in Byzantine art, Avhich gave clear evidence that before the conquest of this province from the Byzantine empire in the seA-enth century it had been an im portant city of that civilization Avhich immediately- succeeded the Roman. The important question Avhich I could not determine was whether, in the old Roman times, it had been a place of note. There can be little doubt that a future examination, of a more minute character than I Avas able to give, would deter mine this point, and it is not at all impossible that upon the old stones might be found seven-branched candlesticks, pots of manna, or emblems of a still older date, which would carry it back to JeAvish times. Meanwhile I looked anxious ly, but in vain, for an inscription Avhich might throAV some light on the subject, and it is certain that amid such a mass of ruin such are to be found. All my inquiries for old coins only tended to alarm the villagers, who looked on my pro ceedings with their usual suspicion, and associated my visit and my desire for old money with their taxes, Avhich is the only idea that the fellah of Palestine seems able to connect with the visit of a prying and inquisitive stranger. The whole of the country Avhich surrounds Khisfin is susceptible of the highest degree of cultivation; the land is eminently fertile and almost a dead level, capable of producing abun-"], [269, "KHISFIN. 255 dant crops, if there were any people to cultivate it. As it is, it is allowed to run to waste. It affords pasture to their flocks, but these are scanty, through fear of the Arabs, and the people, unable to rely upon the government for protec tion, and, indeed, being only aware that there is a govern ment through its tax-gatherers, are sullen and suspicious and discouraged, and utterly without energy to do more than. provide themselves with the barest necessaries of life."], [270, "FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY. Haifa, March 31. \u2014 From Khisfin, the ruins of Avhich I described in my last letter, I struck off in a westerly direc tion under the . guidance of the sheik Avho had been my host the night before, and who, now that he was convinced that I had nothing to do with tax-gathering, and was only possessed by Avhat must haA-e seemed to him an insane desire to find old stones and make pictures of them, took an evi dent pleasure in ministering to such a harmless form of in sanity; in fact he became quite a bore on the subject. As he Avas naturally unable to appreciate any distinction be tween one old stone and another, he was constantly making me ride out of my way to look at some weather-beaten piece of basalt Avhich had a fancied resemblance to a wild animal; or to a mound, the ruins on Avhich belonged to a village that had been deserted within the last twenty years. Still I nevTer could afford to treat his assurances with indifference, as there Avas always the possibility, until I satisfied myself to the contrary, that the stones to Avhich he was guiding me might possess interest; and indeed on one occasion they did, for they turned out to be the ruins of a Roman town, where a few fragments of columns and capitals still remained to bear testimony to the particular civilization to which they belonged, and Avhich, although they did not present any striking architectural features \u2014 indeed, the remains were somewhat insignificant \u2014 it Avas always a satisfaction to have been the first to discover. The name of these ruins was Esfera. Near them a very singular and unpleasant accident oc curred to me. I rode my horse to drink at what seemed a muddy puddle, which was about ten or tAvelve feet in diam eter. Instead of being content to drink at the margin, he took two steps into it, and suddenly disappeared head first;"], [271, "FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY. 257 that is, his head disappeared, his hind-quarters remained for a moment poised above the Avater just long enough to en able me to throAV myself off backward into about two feet of puddle. WTe had walked into an overfloAved well. When his hind-quarters at last went down into it his head came up, or, at all events, as much of it as was required for breathing and snorting, Avhich he did prodigiously, evidently in a panic of terror, while I stood drenched and shivering on the bank in the cold east wind and sleet, wondering how Ave were ever to get him out. The poor beast Avas out of his depth, but the dimensions of the Avell were too limited to enable him to SAvim, or eA'en to scramble freelj7. Fortu nately I had sent on my saddlebags by my servant, or the animal Avould have been hopelessly Aveighted down. As it was, it Avas only by the united efforts of the party tugging at the bridle and stirrup-leathers that, after many futile efforts, at the end of each of Avhich he fell back and for a moment disappeared altogether, we ultimately succeeded in extricating him. Meantime my own plight Avas in the last degree unenviable, the more especially as I was not in very good health at the time, a consideration which induced my companion, with a truly commendable devotion, to take off his nether garments and insist on my Avearing them instead of my own, Avhile he performed the remainder of the day's journey in the slight protection which he wore beneath them. It Avas in this guise, and Avhile still discussing my strange mishap, that onr attention Avas suddenly arrested by finding ourselves surrounded by what are perhaps the most interest ing of antiquarian objects, a number of dolmens. In a very limited area \u2014 none of them were over two hundred yards apart \u2014 I counted twenty. The subject of these rude stone monuments of a prehistoric age is so interesting that I will venture on a few words in regard to them. The most remarkable point about Syrian dolmens is, that Avhile they have been found in numbers to the east of the Jordan, not one has been discovered in Judea or Samaria, and only tAvo or three in Galilee; and those are doubtful specimens. Indeed, it is only of late years that they haA*e attracted the notice of explorers east of the Jordan ; but 17"], [272, "258 HAIFA since attention has been specially directed to the subject, Ave have constantly been having neAV discoveries. Six years ago I found one of the first at a spot not more than tAventy miles from the hitherto unknoAvn field I had now come upon. That dolmen stood alone, and being previously unaware of their existence in this part of the world, I examined it with the greatest interest. Since then Captain Conder, during his hurried survey in Moab, has found above seven hundred in that part of the country, and the result has been that the controversy as to the purpose for which they were designed has been reopened Avith renewed A-igor. The dolmen, which usually consists of three perpendicular stones forming three sides of a small chamber, with a single huge covering slab as its roof, is found in almost every part of the world except America, though I saw a notice in a paper the other day of one having been discovered in Mis souri. There are stone monuments in Central America, I be lieve, somewhat resembling them, but I am not aAvare that the point has been satisfactorily determined, and it is of the highest interest that it should be, as it would establish the existence of general contact betAveen the universal families of that ancient stock which preceded both the Aryan and Semitic racfcs, and which belonged, therefore, to the illiter ate and prehistoric age of the use of bronze and of flint. Dolmens have been found in almost eA-ery country in Europe. They are numerous in the British Isles, France, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Prussia, and the south of Rus sia. I have myself found them in the mountains of Oircas sia, and they exist in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, in great numbers in Algeria and the north coast of Africa, in Asia Minor and India, and Ave have recently heard of them in Japan! Wherever they exist are generally to be found menhirs, or single monolithic stones, and stone circles, such as Stonehenge in England, or long i-oavs of standing stones, such as those to be found at Carnac in Brittany, or smaller stone circles, such as are common to the east of the Jordan. Those found in Syria are generally placed in a position com manding an extensive view and in close proximity to water. They are either \" free standing,\" that is, quite alone and isolated, or they are C0ATered by cairns of stones; or they"], [273, "FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY. 259 are, as the majority were in this instance, perched upon piles of stones. It has been hitherto supposed that in all these cases they were sepulchral monuments, but it has been recently sug gested that those alone beneath the cairns may have served this purpose, and those which were free standing or on cairns may have been used as altars. The basis for this conjecture consists in the fact that the flat covering stones of the Syrian dolmens are A-ery often provided with cups or hollows, which may have served to hold sacrificial oil; and, moreover, the free standing dolmens are often on smooth rock, so that it Avould not be possible to inter a body beneath them. I have seen the covering slab to be as large as eleven feet long by five Avide, though those in the field I Avas noAV examining Avere much smaller, some of the covering stones not being above five feet by three or four; this was probably owing to their being of basalt, Avhich is much heavier than ordi nary stone. Nearly all were trilithons, the covering slab being sometimes held in position by pebbles inserted under it; and in many instances they appeared to have a slight slant which Avas not the result of accident. The natives here call them \" Jews' burial-grounds,\" show' ing that the local tradition is in favor of their being sepul chral monuments, though it is A-ery certain they date from a period long anterior to the JeAvs. Indeed, the probability is that the disappearance of these monuments from Avestern Palestine, where they no doubt existed, is due to the com mand to destroy heathen monuments. Thus, in Deuteronomy, we find again and again repeated injunctions to overthrow the Canaanite altars, and to break or smash their pillars. These exhortations avc find carried into practice by Heze kiah and Josiah in Judea, and as the Book of Deuteronomy Avas held sacred by the ten tribes as well as by the two, we are justified in supposing that they carried out the order in Samaria and Galilee. But the land to the east of the Jordan always contained a mixed population, over which the kings of Israel and Judah exercised but little control. Baal wor ship Avas rife in Bashan, Gilead, and Moab in the days of Jeremiah, and the reforming zeal of Hezekiah did not affect the land where Chemosh and Ishtar, Baal, Peor, Nebo, and"], [274, "260 HAIFA Meni yet continued to be worshipped. This accounts for dolmens not having been found, except with a feAV doubtful specimens, in Galilee to the west of the Jordan. With the exception of the roughly excavated hollows in the covering slab, these rude stone monuments of Syria have, so far as is known, neither ornamentation nor rune nor other mark of the engraver's tool. In comparatively few instances they are made of hewn stone, very roughly cut, but generally they are of natural blocks and slabs entirely unformed. Thus, if there be any comparative scale of an tiquity on which we can rely connected with the finish of the monument, the Syrian dolmens may claim to be consid ered among the oldest of their kind. The word \" dolmen,\" usually rendered table-stone, should, according to Max Miiller, be more properly translated \" holed \" stone, implying either a gateway, such as is formed by the trilithon, or else applying to menhirs and dolmens pierced Avith a hole, as in the case of the Ring stone, the Odin stone, and a peculiar class of holed dolmens. The one I saw in Circassia Avas of this latter category. Instead of three stones supporting the covering slab, as is almost inA-a riably the case in Syria, there were four, and in the centre of the fourth Avas a circular hole, about eighteen inches in diameter, or just large enough to allow a thin man to squeeze through. Some have supposed these holes to be connected Avith some sacrificial rite, others to be due to the superstition that the dead could not rest in peace in tombs Avithout an inlet for air. But the Avhole subject is encom passed Avith mystery, and affords material for endless con jecture. So also do the sacred stone circles, of Avhich I have seen several to the east of the Jordan. They are held in the greatest veneration by the Arabs, who can give no rational explanation of the sacred character they possess, except that they have been sacred from immemorial time. Here, again, these may either have originally had a sepulchral character, or they may have had reference to that peculiar and most ancient worship of which the menhir or monolith was the emblem, for in some instances menhirs are placed in certain fixed positions in regard to the circles, or they may have"], [275, "FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY. 261 had an astronomical significance. It is singular that to this day the reverential attitude of the Arab is outside of the circle with his face to the rising sun, Avhile in India the same circles are to be found among the Khonds in connec tion with the worship of the rising sun, the tallest member of the circle being towards the east. The conclusions at which we may proximately arrive with reference to these interesting monuments are \u2014 according to Captain Conder, to Avhose researches I am indebted for many of the foregoing remarks \u2014 that the menhir is the em blem of the earliest religious idea suggested by the crea tive potency; that the circle may either have a sacred sig nificance connected therewith, or be a sepulchral enclosure; that the dolmen, when free standing, is more likely to have been an altar than a tomb, but when buried beneath a cairn it may have been sepulchral; that the cairn is not always sepulchral, being sometimes a memorial heap; and that all are relics of a long-buried past."], [276, "THE DISCOVERY OF UMM EL-KANATAR. Haifa, March 20. \u2014 When we had sufficiently satisfied our curiosity Avith regard to the dolmens, Avhich I described in my last letter, the sheik Avho was our guide disappeared suddenly over the edge of the plateau on which they stood, down what seemed to he a precipice of black basalt. His reply to our anxious inquiry as to AA'hither he was leading us \u2014 \" to very old stones, with writing on them \" \u2014 was a talismanic utter ance which at once overcame all hesitation. On such occa sions there rises in the mind of the cold and Aveary and half starving traveller (and I answered to this description at the moment) visions of possible Moabite stones, trilingual in scriptions, and all the other prizes which reward successful Palestine research. I felt, therefore, ready to make any plunge into unknown depths that he might choose to sug gest, but certainly this was a bad one. Some two thousand feet below us, distant not more than seven miles, gleamed the still waters of the Sea of Galilee. We stood on the upper edge of one of the branches of the Wady Samak, which leads down to it. To our left, scarce a mile off, we could see the old crusading ruin of the Kasr Berdawil, or Baldwin's Castle, perched on a promontory the sides of which are sheer precipices, thus offering to the old Avarriors a position of magnificent strength. It is one of the least known of the Crusading strongholds, but I was assured by a friend, Avho, so far as I know, is the only traveller Avho has visited it, that beyond a few crumbling walls there was ab solutely nothing to be seen, so, as I had better game in pros pect, I did not turn aside to it, as I had originally intended, but resolutely prepared to risk my neck amid the basalt blocks of the cliff down which the sheik was now disappear ing. Fortunately, though it Avas a bad descent, it was not"], [277, "THE DISCOVERY OF UMM EL-KAN AT AR. 263 a long one. I never could understand how my horse man aged it, for I had left him to take care of himself, finding my oAvn legs a safer method of descent; but in these lonely regions the instinct of not getting separated from the rest of the party is as strong with animals as Avith men, and they may generally be trusted to follow their companions. After scrambling down about five hundred feet Ave came to a sort of bench or narrow plateau, on the flank of the ra vine, and on turning round a huge rock of black basalt came suddenly upon one of the most delightful scenic surprises which it was possible to imagine. Here in this Avild, inacces sible spot, in ages long gone by, the ancients had evidently contrived a secure and enchanting retreat, for it was pro vided Avith the first requisite of beauty and of pleasure \u2014 a copious fountain of water. It lay in crystal purity in a still, oblong pool, beneath the perpendicular black rock. Against the rock, and projecting from it, were two large arches which had been constructed of solid masonry, with blocks of stone of immense size. One of these arches Avas almost destroyed, but the other was still in perfect preservation. It measured twenty-three feet in breadth, sixteen feet in height, and six feet six inches in depth, this being therefore the Avidth of the fountain, which Avas also tAventy-three feet long and about two feet deep. To my astonishment it contained numbers of small fish, which Avas the more surprising as it possessed no apparent outlet; but it Avas too cold and fresh and sparkling to be anything but a living stream, and prob ably disappeared by a subterranean passage through a large crevice which I observed in the rock. The Avide-spreading branches of a venerable oak which grew directly in front of the arch threw a delightful shade over it, while delicate ferns clothed the sides of the grotto, which seemed to woo us to a repose and indolence AA'hich was, alas, under the circumstances, denied to us. On the keystone of the arch there Avas a partially effaced inscrip tion. Though it was sixteen feet overhead, and therefore inaccessible, I should not have abandoned some attempt to decipher it had I not felt sure that, even if I Avere close to it, it was too much defaced by the storms of ages to be legible. I feel little doubt, however, about its having been in the"], [278, "264 HAIFA. Greek character; while on a slab of stone at the side of the spring I found carved the figure of a lion, which was in good preservation, and of which I made a sketch. The sheik was so impatient to take me somewhere else that he scarcely alloAved me time to avail myself of this tempting spot to take the refreshment of Avhich I stood much in need. He told me the name of the place Avas Umm el-Kanatar, or, being interpreted, \" the place of arches,\" a name evidently derived from its most striking feature, and he said there was a ruin close by\\ This turned out to be not a hundred yards distant, and consisted of walls still standing to a height of about seven feet, composed of three courses of stone, the blocks averaging about two feet one way by two feet six the other, but being in some instances much larger. These walls enclosed an area of about fifty feet by thirty-five, which Avas covered by a mass of ruins which had been tossed about in the wildest confusion. It was quite evident that it had been the work of an earthquake. Six columns, varying from ten to twelve feet in height, rose from the tumbled masses of building-stone at every angle. It was impossible Avithout moving the huge blocks Avhich en cumbered their bases and hid their pedestals, and balanced them in all sorts of positions, to tell whether they were in situ or not. The huge moulded stones which formed the sides of the entrance, though still one above the other, had been shaken out of position, but they bore all the character of carving Avhich is peculiar to Jewish architecture, and at once led me to conclude that here, as at Eddikke, I had dis covered the ruins of an ancient JeAvish synagogue, dating probably from the first or second century a. d. This im pression was confirmed as I came to examine the ruin more narrowly. Here was the large stone cut in the shape of an arch, which had probably stood upon the lintel of the princi pal entrance; and here was a fragment of a handsome cor nice of the same peculiar pattern I had found at Eddikke, resembling the egg-and-dart pattern of modern ornamenta- tion. Here were the columns inside the walls of the build ing instead of outside, which would have been the case had it been a Greek temple, and here were the massive stones, not set in mortar, which would have been the case if it had"], [279, "THE DISCOVERY OF UMM EL-KANATAR. 265 been an early Christian basilica or church. Here, too, was a stone on which was carved the representation of an eagle, in deference to the prejudices of the Roman conquerors under whose auspices these synagogues appertaining to the Jewish Patriarchate of Tiberias were built, the work having evidently been executed by Roman workmen. I could find no inscription, but it would take days to examine all the stones thoroughly, and it is most probable that a careful investigation of them Avould reveal something which Avould throw a still more definite light on the char acter and period of the building, though I confess I enter tain very little doubt in respect to either. Altogether I re gard these ruins of Umm el-Kanatar as the most interesting discovery I have yet made, and as being well Avorthy an other visit and a more minute examination than I Avas able to bestow upon them. The sheik noAV appeared to think he had done his duty, and expressed his intention of returning to his village and of leaving me to find my way doAA-n the Wady Samak by myself. This I did not object to, as there was still plenty of daylight, and I could, in fact, make out from where I was noAAr standing the position of the ruins of Kersa on the mar gin of the lake, Avhither I had despatched my servants and baggage animals direct from my last night's quarters, with orders to await my arrival there. It was up the branch of the Avady that I was descending that the projected railway from Haifa to Damascus would have to be led, and it was some satisfaction to see that it offered facilities for the ascent of the line. The scenery Avas in the highest degree picturesque, the sides of the valley sometimes sloping back for some distance to the foot of the basalt precipices which formed its upper wall; at others these approached and formed projecting and overhanging promontories, like that on Avhich the Kasr Berdawil was situated. We scrambled doAvn by a rugged path to the small stream at the bottom Avith the view of following it, if possible, to its outlet on the lake, but this Ave soon found to be impracticable, and were assured by a Bedouin, Avhose hut Ave finally reached on its margin, that Ave must cross it, and make an ascent on the opposite side. This led us by a"], [280, "HAIFA 266 roundabout, hilly, but picturesque route across numerous and intersecting wadys, and past one ruin, of which noth ing remained but the black blocks of hewn basalt. I was fortunate enough, however, to meet a man who told me the name, Avhich I added to my list of unknown ruins, and so, after much scrambling, Ave reached at last the white lime stone strata, and the purling brook again with its fringe of oleanders, and could see in the distance the one large soli tary tree which we had given as our rendezvous, and beneath which our servants were standing, that marks the site of the ruins of Kersa, or the Gergesa of the Bible, where Christ healed the two men possessed Avith devils, and suffered those malignant spirits to enter into the herd of swine. There is a discrepancy in the accounts of the Evangelists in their narrative of the incident. Mark and Luke, in our version, locate it in the country of the Gadarenes, but MattheAv states it to have taken place in the country of the Gergesenes. The Vulgate, Arabic, and others that follow the Vulgate read Gergesa in all the Evangelists, and there can be no doubt that this is the correct reading, for the sim ple reason that the miracles could not have taken place in the country of the Gadarenes, a district AA-hich lies south of the Yarmuk, and at a long distance from the lake, the prin cipal town, Gadara, the modern Um Keis, about the identi fication of which there can be no doubt, being at least eight miles from it. Now the account says that \" when he came out of the ship immediately there met him a man,\" also that the herd ran doAvn a steep place violently into the sea. To do this, if the incident had taken place at Gadara, they must have descended twelve hundred feet to the Yarmuk, swam across that river, clambered up the opposite bank, and then raced for about six miles across the plain before they could reach the nearest margin of the lake. Scarcely any amount of insanity on the part of the devils would account for such a mad career, but in point of fact it does not tally with the Scripture record, according to which they rushed doAvn a steep place into the sea. This is exactly Avhat they could do at Kersa. The margin of the lake is here within a few rods of the base of the cliff, where there are ancient tombs, out of which may have issued the men who met Christ on the"], [281, "THE DISCOVERY OF UMM EL-KANATAR. 267 plateau above; and it is easy to suppose that the swine, rush ing down the sloping cliff, would have enough impetus to carry them across the narrow slip of shore at its base. The remains noAv only consist of long lines of wall, Avhich may easily be traced, and of a considerable area strewn with building-stones, which show that it must in old time have contained a considerable population. This is the more likely to be the case as it was the chief town of a district which Avas called after it. In fact, this picturesque and interesting Wady Samak, Avith its evidences of a former civilization, and its \" place of arches\" and handsome synagogue, Avas, in fact, \"the country of the Gergesenes;\" and there can be little doubt that to Christ and his disciples the remote cor ners of it, which I had been one of the first to explore, Avere intimately known.* The ruins of Kersa are a good deal overgrown, and in the cover Avhich is thus afforded I put up a wild boar. He dashed away so suddenly, hoAvever, that a bullet from a re volver, which Avas sent after him, failed to produce any re sult. I have little doubt that the old Roman road turned from the lake at this point up the Wady Samak, as there are traces here and there indicating such a probability. It will be a singular commentary on the progress of events if it turns out that it has taken the best gradient, and if, upon its ancient track, the scream of the locomotive may in the near future be heard waking up the long-silent echoes of the country of the Gergesenes. * The greater part of the AVady Samak and the surrounding country had, immediately prior to my visit, been most accurately surveyed by Mr. Gottlieb Schumacher, the son of the American vice-consul at Haifa, whose admirable and exhaustive surveys are embodied in the proceedings of the English and German Palestine Exploration Societies, and who was my companion on the occasion of our discovery of the ruins of Uinm el-Kanatar."], [282, "THE ROCK TOMBS OF PALESTINE. Haifa, April 26. \u2014 The fact that I am laboring under a peculiar phase of insanity, Avhich takes the form of descend ing with a light into the bowels of the earth with a measur ing tape, and writing down cabalistic signs of what I find there, Avhether it be in a cistern or a tomb, or a natural cav ern, has become pretty Avidely known among the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, and the consequence is that from time to time I receive information which may minister to this harmless monomania. The other day, for instance, a stonecutter whom I had employed on some building opera tions came to me with the intelligence that while he and some villagers had been getting out stone for a house at a place about twenty miles distant they had unexpectedly come upon a series of subterranean chambers. His ac count was so tempting that, though prepared by experience for disappointment when acting upon purely native infor mation, I nevertheless thought the possible results AA-orth an effort, and proceeded therefore to the village in question, Avhich was situated in the centre of the Plain of Esdraelon. The sheik was at first somewhat reluctant to show me the spot, as the fellahin have an inherent suspicion of all in vestigations of this nature, believing them to be mysterious ly connected with the discovery of treasure, which, when found, they will be accused of having concealed, and pun ished for it. He finally consented, however, to lead the way, and brought me to an opening in the earth, from the surface of which a flight of nine stone steps led down to a small paved court, about six feet square, which had now been emptied of the soil which had previously concealed its existence. The sides of this court, which were about twelve feet high, were formed of massive masonry, the blocks of stone being each from eighteen inches to tAvo feet square,"], [283, "THE ROCK TOMBS OF PALESTINE. 269 set in mortar. A short vaulted passage, three feet long, two feet six Avide, and five feet high, led from it into a sub terranean chamber of fine Avorkmanship, and in such a high state of preservation that it Avas difficult to realize that from fifteen hundred to two thousand years had elapsed since its stone floor had been trodden by the foot of man. It was fourteen feet long, eight broad, and eight feet six in height, with a vaulted roof, the walls consisting of plain chiselled stones set in mortar, in courses of from two feet to two feet six inches in height. On the left of this chamber was a sin gle koka, or tunnel, heAvn in the rock for the reception of a dead body. The roof was vaulted and of solid masoniy. On the side opposite the entrance Avas another vaulted pas sage, which was seven feet six in length, and led into a chamber hewn out of the solid rock, twelve feet by ten feet six, and six feet six in height. This contained three kokim and a loculus under an arcosolium; but the side of the locu lus, as well as those of the kokim, had been much injured. The villagers, who had opened these tombs for the first time only a few weeks before, told us they had only found human bones in them, but I strongly suspect they had found ornaments which they were afraid to exhibit, though I offered them money. One or tAvo glass bottles and earth emvare jars they also said they had found and broken. Not far from these tombs was another smaller excavation, the entrance to Avhich presented the appearance of an ordi nary cave, but on entering it Ave found ourselves in a small, circular, rock-hewn chamber, the floor so covered with rub ble that it Avas not possible to stand upright. In the centre of the roof was an aperture eighteen inches square, opening to the sky, carefully hewn, and from it led a passage of masonry, the stones also set in mortar, two feet six broad, and about five feet to the point Avhere it Avas completely choked Avith earth. Had I had time to excavate I should no doubt haATe found that it led into a tomb. The entrance to this passage Avas almost completely blocked by the capital of a handsome Ionic column; the column itself was eighteen inches in diameter. How it ever came to be wedged down in this underground passage I cannot conceive. Among the stones in the vicinity which had been unearthed by the na-"], [284, "270 HAIFA. tives I found one on which was carved a seven-branched candlestick, another of Jewish moulding, a sarcophagus, several fragments of columns, and a monolith standing ten feet from the debris at its base, with grooves and slots sim ilar to others which I have seen on Carmel, but taller. I can only imagine it to have formed part of some olive-press ing machinery. In the neighbouring rocks were heAvn vats and wine-presses. The discovery of this tomb, with the peculiar character istics which marked its construction, and the objects which surrounded it, afforded a fertile subject of conjecture. In order that my readers may understand the considerations to which it gave rise, I must enter a little more fully than I have hitherto done into the subject of the ancient Jewish methods of sepulture. These consist of sundry varieties, and it has been attempted to fix their dates from the varia tions Avhich have been observed, as well as to discriminate by them between Christian and Jewish tombs. So far as my own investigation goes, I have been unable to fix any positive rule in the matter, my experience being that one no sooner forms a theory based upon observation, than one makes some new discovery Avhich upsets it. Roughly, the tombs which I have investigated may be divided into the following categories : 1. Rock-hewn tombs containing noth ing but loculi; 2. Rock-hewn tombs containing nothing but kokim; 3. Rock-hewn tombs containing both; 4. Masonry tombs containing either loculi or kokim, or both together; 5. Sarcophagi; 6. Rock-sunk tombs. A rock-hewn tomb is an excavation made in the solid rock (advantage generally has been taken of a natural cavern), and round the sides of the chambers so formed, Avhich A-ary in dimensions, arc ranged the receptacles for the dead. In some cases these are more than one chamber. In Sheik Abreikh, for in stance, I counted fifteen opening one into another. Some times these are one above another, and one has to enter them from below through a hole in the stone roof which forms the floor of the upper chamber. A koka is a rec tangular sloping space cut into the rock, tunnel fashion, ex tending six feet horizontally, sufficiently wide and high to admit of a corpse being pushed into it. A loculus is a"], [285, "THE ROCK TOMBS OF PALESTINE. 271 trough cut laterally into the rock, Avhich is arched above so as to form Avhat is called an arcosolium. This trough is generally about six feet long, two feet six broad, and two feet deep. It is thus separated from the chamber by a wall of rock two feet high. A large tomb will contain as manv as twelve loculi ranged around it. At first it was supposed that the kokim tombs were the oldest; then it Avas found that loculi and kokim were some times found in the same tomb; and, indeed, there seems now to be no reason to suppose that one kind is older than the other. That the Christians used both is certain from the fact that Greek inscriptions Avith Christian ornaments are to be found OA'er the doors of tombs containing kokim as Avell as loculi. Masonry tombs are only found in Galilee, where they are very rare. Indeed, so far as I am aware, this is only the sixth that has been discovered; but what gave it a special interest in my eyes is the fact that the stones were set in mortar, which is not the case with any of the others, ancient Jewish synagogues, as well as their masonry tombs, being built without cement. I therefore had made up my mind that this was a Christian tomb, the early Christians having evidently continued the Jewish method of sepulture, more especially as it is oriented, which is not the case Avith Jewish tombs; and, indeed, the character of the masonry and the fragments of columns and capitals lying about in duced me to place it in the Byzantine period, possibly as late even as the fourth or fifth century a.d. But then I stum bled upon the stone Avith the seven-branched candlestick, an unmistakably Jewish emblem, Avhich threw the date back. It is true that this stone was not built into the tomb, and might have formed part of a building of a date long ante rior to it. Indeed, we know that on this spot, which is now called Jebata, and which is undoubtedly the Biblical Gaba tha, was formerly a Jewish town of some importance, and its remains have doubtless got mixed up with those of a later Byzantine period, to which I still think it probable that the tomb which I discovered belongs. It differs from any I have yet seen in the imposing char acter of its entrance. Its flight of nine handsome stone steps, leading doAvn the open court, and the A-aulted passage,"], [286, "272 HAIFA. with its massive masonry, give it quite a peculiar character. The entrance to the rock-hewn tomb is usually through a small doorway from three to four feet in height, just large enough to permit a man to squeeze through without very great inconvenience, and it is usually closed by a circular stone like a millstone, Avhich runs in a groove, and can be rolled across it, though sometimes the door consists of a huge curved slab. The sarcophagus is too well known to need description. The most remarkable collection of them which I have seen is at Umin Keis, the biblical Gadara, where there are at least tAvo hundred, many of them ranged in two rows on either side of the Avay leading out of the city. They are of black basalt, and are often beautifully carved and high ly ornamented. I do not think they were so much used by the Jews as by Christians, though sometimes sarcophagi are found placed in loculi. At all events, they Avere not the orig inal Jewish method of burial, and, if used by them at all, the habit was one which they probably adopted from their Roman conquerors. The sunk tombs are common in various jmrts of Galilee \u2014 especially in the rocky hillsides of the range upon which Nazareth is situated. They consist of rectangular troughs, sufficiently large to contain a human body, sunk into the surface of the living rock, and covered with a huge lid of stone, sometimes flat, but more often cut conicallyr, so as to have a high central ridge. I have more than once endeav oured to remove these from the tombs, which had never been opened, where they Avere still in situ, but never happened to be accompanied by a sufficient number of men or to have adequate leverage appliances with me. As these stones are generally about seven feet long, three broad, and from two to three feet thick, they require the application of no little force to remove them. They \\-ary in size, howeA-er, and I have seen sunk tombs for babies not above eighteen inches long. Apart from the interest which attaches to the whole question of rock sepulture in Palestine, the most interesting relics of antiquity are generally found in the tombs, Avhile not uncommonly \\-aluable inscriptions are met with. Many of them are ornamented Avith pictorial representations, Avhich have been laid on Avith coloured pigment, and the"], [287, "THE ROCK TOMBS OF PALESTINE. 273 designs are often curious and interesting. Altogether, al though the investigation of these mortuary chambers is often attended with great difficulty and discomfort, they frequently furnish results Avhich compensate for the fatigue that they involve. 18"], [288, "GENERAL GORDON'S LAST VISIT TO HAIFA. Haifa, May 10. \u2014 The interest Avhich attaches to the memory of the late General Gordon must be my apology for devoting a letter to my personal reminiscences of one whose singularly pure and lofty character attracted me to him at a time when he was comparatively unknown. Noth ing is in fact more remarkable than the suddenness of the notoriety into which he sprang, a notoriety from which he of all men would have the most shrunk, and of the knowl edge of which, by the singular fatality Avhich isolated him from the world in his beleaguered garrison, he was to the last unconscious. Owing to his own modesty and love of retirement, and to the fact that his life had been largely spent abroad and in the service of foreign governments, he was personally almost unknoAvn in London society. His friends consisted chiefly of his brother officers and a few congenial spirits whose acquaintance he had made in various parts of the world. By the public at large he had only been heard of as \" Chinese \" Gordon, and few cared to inquire Avhat manner of man he AA-as. It was just twenty-nine years ago since I first met him in the trenches before Sebastopol. He was quite a young and unknown officer at that time, and I should have forgotten the circumstance had we not again come across each other three years afterwards in China, and upon comparing notes found that we had already met in the Crimea. He had not then been appointed to the command of the \" ever victorious army,\" and was still a juuior Captain of Engineers. I left China before he entered the Chinese service, and almost im mediately after his arrival, so that I saAV very little of him. Still, I had seen enough to make me Avatch his subsequent career Avith great interest, but our paths had not again crossed until one day, about two years ago, I received a let-"], [289, "GENERAL GORDON'S LAST VISIT TO HAIFA. 275 ter from Jaffa signed C. G. Gordon, asking for information in regard to Haifa as a residence, and expressing his inten tion of possibly paying me a visit. As I have many friends of the name, I was puzzled for the moment. The writer did not mention anything in the letter to give a cleAv to his identity, though it Avas addressed as from one old friend to another. It was only accidentally that the same afternoon the vice-consul here asked me if I kneAV anything of a Gen eral Gordon, as some letters had arrived to his care for an individual of that name. I at once perceived Avho my cor respondent must be. I immediately addressed him a cordial invitation to pay me a visit, which he promptly responded to, and avc spent a few very pleasant days together. The Hicks disaster in the Soudan had not then occurred, so that the affairs of that country and its Mahdi had not yet acquired the notoriety they were destined so soon to at tain ; .but Gordon's intimate knowledge of the country in duced him to express his opinion in regard to its condi tion. He deprecated strongly the Avhole course adopted by the British government in Egypt from the beginning, warned me that they underrated the nature of the moA'cment in the Soudan, to Avhich country he was then in favour of granting independence under native rulers, was entirely oj^posed to English officers at the head of Egyptian troops, thrusting themselves into the mess, and maintained that the whole af fair should be settled by a civil commissioner, who should at once be sent by England to the Mahdi to arrange with him the terms upon Avhich the Soudan should be rendered independent of Egypt. As at this time the English had not come into violent hostile collision Avith the Mahdi, Gordon declared his conviction that such a mission would be favour ably received, and that a state of affairs might be arranged which, although not so favourable to the Soudanese as he could have wished, would leave them better off than under Egyptian rule. His idea was that if the Mahdi did not shoAV himself amenable to reason, he might be threatened Avith a rebellion of the local Soudanese chiefs, Avho, he felt con vinced, could easily be induced to combine against him. In fact, before going to the Madhi he would have sounded the"], [290, "276 HAIFA feeling of these chiefs, with a view, if necessary, to organiz ing a revolt against him. In a word, his view was that the Soudan question should be settled by the Soudanese alone, that no Egyptians should be mixed up in the affair; and I have no doubt that if the British government had thought of availing themselves of Gordon's services at this juncture, the question of the Soudan might have been arranged satisfactorily to all parties, ex cept, perhaps, the Egyptian and Turkish governments. He was at that time particularly strong on the necessity of a railway from Suakim to Berber, the concession for which was being then applied for by English railway contractors, Avho were sanguine of success. He assured me that they were Avasting their time; that it Avas a concession the Egyp tian government would never grant, as they were afraid if they did that the whole trade of the Soudan would be di verted to Suakim instead of, as now, coming down to Cairo. \"\"It is a short-sighted policy,\" he remarked, \"for without that railway Egypt will one day not only lose the trade of the Soudan, but the Soudan itself. Not long afterwards there Avas a report that the concession had been granted, and he wrote me a long letter of many pages, which began with warning me not to believe the report, as it was quite impossible that it could be true, his knowledge of the Egyptian government convincing him that they would make promises, but that nothing would ever induce them to consent to this railway being made, unless they were coerced into it by the British government. He felt equally con vinced that the British government had no intention of using their authority in this direction, as, in his opinion, they should do, and that the report, therefore, was without foundation. This, in fact, turned out to be the case. General Gordon, after spending a few days at Haifa, re turned to Jerusalem, promising to bring his tents two months later and pitch them next to mine at Esfia on the summit of Carmel. I was eagerly looking forward to his companion ship in the delightful wilderness of this mountain, and had even marked out in my own mind a spot for his campino-. ground within fifty yards of my own, when, to my great dis appointment, I received a letter from him saying that he was"], [291, "GENERAL CORDONS LAST VISIT TO HAIFA. 277 so deeply interested in biblical studies at the Holy City that he felt it his duty to change his mind, as he might never again have an opportunity of verifying the correctness of the views he entertained in regard to the typical nature of its configuration. Not long afterwards I received another long letter from him on the subject of the Jordan valley canal scheme, in Avhich he took a Avarm interest. This led to a correspondence, as I entirely differed from him as to its practicability. Toav ards the end of the year he wrote, saying that he was sudden ly summoned to the Congo, and bidding me adieu. Curious ly enough, in my reply I said that I did not say good-bye, as I felt sure I should see him again before he left the country. A feAv days afterwards he once more turned up at Haifa. He had embarked at Jaffa for Port Said in a coun try sailing craft, and he had been driven by stress of weath er so far out of his course that his crew finally ran in here for shelter. At this time affairs in the Soudan Avere in a very acute stage, and Ave again discussed them at great length. His vieAvs had naturally undergone a change, as the policy which had been possible seven or eight months previously was im practicable now. He felt great doubt whether, if he Avent to the Soudan, he could succeed in achieving now w~hat he was convinced he could have accomplished then, or Avhether the policy ho had sketched out was longer feasible. \" If it were not for the Soudanese, whom I love,\" he said, \" the easy Avay out of it for the English government would be to invite the Turks to go, but it is not probable that they have the sense to make the proposition, or that the Turks would be such fools as to accept it.\" He refused altogether to anticipate the possibility of his being sent to the Soudan, partly because he felt bound in honour to go to the Congo for the King of the Belgians, and partly because he had already had to6 many differences Avith the heads of departments under which he had served, and Avas regarded Avith too little favour, on account of his refusal to look at every question through official spectacles, to be a persona grata to the English government. He was detained here a week, during which time we not only discussed fully"], [292, "HAIFA 278 the Egyptian and Soudanese questions, but talked over old times in China, when he gave me many graphic descriptions of incidents in his Chinese campaigns, which have prob ably never been heard of, and Avhich I now regret I did not record. His modesty Avas such that I could only compel him to narrate his OAvn adventures by a process of severe cross examination. One of his marked peculiarities in conversation was his employment of phrases Avhich he had himself coined to repre sent certain ideas. Thus he would say of a man: \"So-and so is a very good fellow, but he would never break his medal,\" by which he meant that he was ambitious. Gordon himself, when the Emperor of China gave him, in return for his services, a very valuable gold medal, fearing that the sense of gratification he derived from it might prove a snare to him, broke it up and gave away the pieces. Hence the allusion. Again, he would say, if asked if he kneAV so-and-so. \" I only met him once and then he rent me.\" From which I understood that he had felt it his duty on that occasion to give the individual in question a word of good advice, and that the only thanks was that the man resented it, or, in Scripture phraseology, \" turned again and rent him.\" One day I observed him writing notes on a slip of paper. He asked me the Christian names of two friends who were staying Avith me. I told him, and feeling, I suppose, that my curiosity ought to be gratified, he said, \" I am writing them down on ray prayer list.\" Another day, after using some very strong language in regard to a very high personage who shall be nameless, he added quickly, \" but I pray for him regularly.\" All this without a vestige of cant. If there was a thing he detested it was hypocrisy, and I trust I may not be suspected of it when I say that the thought of Gordon at Khartoum, and the know-ledge that I Avas on his prayer list, was calculated to produce a lump in my throat. He was full of fun and a most cheery companion Avith those be kneAV intimate l}*-. He neA-er forced a conversation in a religious channel. He brought with him from Jerusalem a raised model which he had made, to carry out his theory that the hill upon which"], [293, "GENERAL GORDON'S LAST VISIT TO HAIFA. 279 the greater part of the city was built was in the form of a woman. Taking the mound commonly identified as \"the place of the skull\" as the head, the lines of topographical configuration certainly bore out the resemblance in a very remarkable manner. He was far more full of this than either of the Soudan or the Congo, and was taking it with him to Brussels to show the King of the Belgians. \" I sup pose, as you are the king's guest, you will go and stay at the palace,\" I remarked. \" No, certainly not,\" he replied; \"I shall go to a hotel. I don't want the king's servants to see my old comb.\" He left here on the 18th or 19th of Decem ber, 1883, and Avalked to Acre, twelve miles, to meet the steamer that Avas to take him direct to Marseilles. He sent his luggage in a carriage. His last words as we parted Avere that he felt sure we should never meet again. I said he had been wrong once when he told me that he should not see me again, and I hoped he was Avrong noAv. He said no, he felt that he had no more work to do for God on this earth, and that he should never return from the Congo. Within a month he was in upper Egy-pt. It Avas characteristic of the man that scarcely any one in Haifa knew who he was. Seeing a Arery handsome garden belonging to a rich Syrian, near Acre, he strolled into it, and was accosted by the proprietor, avIio asked him who he was. He replied, \" Gordon Pasha,\" on Avhich my Syrian friend, Avho told me the story, laughed incredulously, and politely shoAved him out. Gordon meekly departed without attempting to insist on his identity. The proprietor told me that he felt convinced that he Avas being imposed upon, be cause Gordon, when spoken to in English, Avould ansAver in bad Arabic, and because, when asked his name, he took his card-case half out of his pocket, as though to give his card, and then, on second thought, put it back again and answered verbally. So my friend lost his chance of enter taining an angel unawares, which he has never ceased to re gret, the more especially as his friends take a pleasure in teasing him about it. My last letter from Gordon is dated Khartoum, the 6th of March.

Haifa, May 25. \u2014 It was from Carmel that in times of old a small cloud was seen rising not bigger than a man's hand, which overcast the heavens, and it is not impossible that a political incident Avhich has just occurred here may prove the diplomatic commencement of a storm of another kind pregnant Avith untold issues. If we look back through his- tory at the origin of some of its greatest eA-ents, we often almost fail to discover them, on account of their insignifi- cance. When the moral atmosphere is charged with elec- tricity, it needs but a spark to produce the shock; and so it is just possible that the upsetting of a few stones, on a bar- ren hillside, may open up a question Avhich may assume pro- portions of very considerable magnitude, as it inArolves the most dangerous of all elements in a dispute, that of religious fanaticism. The Monastery of Carmel, as your readers are doubtless aAvare, is situated on the spur of the mountain Avhich projects in a point at an elevation of about five hun- dred feet above the sea. From this point the mountain grad- ually rises until it attains a height of about nine hundred feet, immediately behind the town of Haifa and the German colony. The mountain here spreads into an elevated plateau of some extent, affording extensive pasture-ground and good arable and A'ineyard land. For some years past the claim of the convent OA'er a large area of this plateau has been a matter of dispute, but it only reached an acute stage the other day, Avhen the toAvns-people were called upon to pay taxes on it. They naturally objected that they ought not to pay taxes on land the use of Avhich they did not enjoy, and access to which Avas forbidden to them by a wall which had been built by the convent as the boundary to its possessions. In order to bring the matter to an issue, some thirty of the"], [296, "HAIFA 282 German colonists and as many of the Moslem inhabitants of the town went up in a body and proceeded vi et armis to tear down the Avail. While thus engaged some of the monks emerged, armed Avith spiritual weapons alone. One of them, elevating his cross, pronounced a solemn curse, first in Ger man and then in Arabic, upon the profaners of their sacred soil. The convent being under the protection of the French government, a formal complaint Avas lodged against the ac tion of the Germans in the matter, and a deputation, con sisting of the German and French vice - consuls, were sent doAvn from Beyrout to inquire into it. Meantime the Turk ish government interfered, as it had a right to do, seeing that many Ottoman subjects had participated in the act com plained of, and decided that the right of the convent to erect the wall Avas a matter for the local tribunals to decide upon, as Avell as the question of the validity of their title to the part of the mountain claimed by them. In the mean time instructions Avere given that, pending the decision of the court, the wall should be replaced in exactly the same position, and of the same dimensions, as before its removal. Advantage was taken of this order to rebuild the wall much more solidly, and to increase its height far beyond the limits prescribed in the order, and the result was the removal of the local governor for negligence in not seeing that the in structions Avere properly carried out. Meantime the town instituted a lawsuit against the convent, calling upon them to substantiate their legal title to the land. Now, one third of the population of Haifa is Moslem and Jews, and about two thirds are Christian. The Christians are all under the direct influence of the convent, and the spirit of religious fanaticism runs high on both sides. On measurement being made of the land claimed by the convent it was found to amount to an area of about twelve square miles. According to Turkish laAv the whole of this would originally belong to the inhabitants of the town for their common use, unless the town council had at some time or other legally parted Avith it for an adequate consideration; This it was denied on the part of the municipality that they had ever done, and search was consequently made in the records for the act of sale, which would have been registered."], [297, "CONVENT OF CARMEL versus TOWN OF HAIFA. 283 On the other hand, the monks had a duly-signed document under Avhich they claimed, but Avhich, on further investiga tion, was found to be practically a fraud, as none of the for malities had been complied with, and the seal had been affixed illegally by an officer who had been induced for a certain consideration to perform the act. It is not contended that the monks were a party to this irregularity. They seem, indeed, rather to have been the victims of their agent at the time, who perpetrated it, leaving them under the delusion that they possessed a valid title, but the discovery left the court no alternative but to pronounce judgment against them. Against this judgment they have appealed to Con stantinople, and it would be difficult to see how it could be reversed, Avere it not that the interests involved are of such a peculiar character that the purely legal side of the ques tion may be overlooked. The prestige Avhich the order of barefooted Carmelites en joys in all Catholic countries is so great that the most power ful influences will be invoked, and possibly not invoked in vain, in their favor. Strong articles have already appeared on the subject in the Continental press of Europe. The Emperor of Austria has, I understand, been personally ap pealed to, while the pilgrims, who, to the number of about four hundred, have already visited the sacred shrine this year, are every one of them missionaries who Avill be so many Peter the Hermits, invoking once more the faith of the true believer to protect the sacred mountain from the grasp of the infidel. But there is an element in the affair which re moves it from the simple category of Cross versus Crescent, and that is, that the interests of some three hundred Germans are involved. As forming part of the population of Haifa, they enjoy equal rights Avith the rest of the towns-people, and Prince Bismarck is not a man to see their rights tamely abandoned to the monks. It is true that the question is one which affects exclusively the Turkish government, and there can be no doubt that it would not willingly deprive an Otto man population of twelve square miles of mountain if they are legally entitled to it, but the united pressure of Catholic Europe might be too poAverf ul a force for the Porte to resist single-handed. It is a different matter when they have the"], [298, "284 HAIFA German government at their back, and this quarrel over a right of way and a patch of hillside may yet be pregnant Avith important consequences. Had the convent entered upon large agricultural operations, their rights over land thus brought into cultivation could not be disputed. The complaint of the population is that they neither cultivate it themselves, nor allow others to cultivate it, or even to graze their flocks upon it. The exclusive possession thus claimed has deprived the German colonists of one of the most im portant desiderata for the success of their colony. A retreat from the heats of summer is almost essential to the health of the colonists. If they had the right of way claimed they could, with ease, construct a wagon-road to the top of the hill overhanging the colony, where, at an eleva tion of nine hundred feet, they would be in full enjoyment of the sea breezes, while only half an hour distant from their homes: The money necessary for the construction of such a sanitarium Avas provided under singular circumstances a few weeks ago. I was riding just outside the tOAvn, on the Nazareth road, Avhen to my surprise I met a foreign lady riding by herself, accompanied only by an Arab, an unusual sight in this country. Following her was a covered litter. On returning to the colony an hour later I found that the litter contained the body of the husband of the lady I had met. He had died in it on the road from Nazareth a couple of hours before I met the poor widow, a perfect stranger and unable to speak a word of the language, forming the solitary attendant of her husband's corpse. These painful circum stances enlisted the Avarmest sympathy on the part of the colonists, whose kindness and consideration so overwhelmed the lady, Avho was herself a countrywoman, that before leav ing she presented the colony with a check for $7500. These simple people had no idea when they were lavishing their kindness on the widoAV that she Avas a lady of large fortune, and this Avas their unexpected reward. And it is Avith this money they hope to build their sanitarium."], [299, "PROGRESS EVEN IN PALESTINE. Haifa, June 7. \u2014 I Avas glad to avail myself of an oppor tunity to revisit Jerusalem after an interval of six years, and by a journey through a part of Judea to see the changes within that period. The attention Avhich has of recent years been directed towards Palestine has perhaps produced more marked results in this province than in Galilee, and in some respects its progress has been more rapid. This is partly owing to the fact that for the past eight years it has been under the administration of a more than usually enlightened pasha, who exercises his authority independently of the Governor-General of Syria, and partly because its holy places prove more attractive both to Jews and Gentiles than do those of Galilee. Hence there has been a larger inflow of capital and of immigration. Three miles from Jaffa lies the German colony of Sarona, which, like the one at Haifa, Avas founded some years ago by the Temple Society. It resembles the one there in the char acter of its buildings and general plan. There is a wide central street Avith neat stone and tiled roofed houses, and two roAvs of shade trees, Avith a short cross street, church, and schoolhouse, and that general air of cleanliness and comfort which Germans understand so well how to impart to their settlements. It is far inferior to Haifa, however, both on the score of salubrity and beauty of position, being situated on a grassy, rolling country destitute of woods, some miles from the sea and the mountains. There is therefore something forlorn in the solitude of its position. The inhabitants suf fer a good deal from fever, and many deaths took place last year, Avhich was unusually unhealthy. On the other hand, the fertility of the soil and its proximity to so large and prosperous a toAvn as Jaffa, which now numbers close upon tAventy thousand inhabitants, enables the settlers to do"], [300, "HAIFA. 286 someAvhat better financially than those at Haifa. They are engaged in extending the area of their orange-groves and vineyards; and as the general experience is that the climate of this country improves under the influence of husbandry, it is to be hoped that a feAV more years will Avork a change in this respect, as they certainly must in the general attrac tiveness of the place. The Temple Society has also a small colony actually in the suburbs of Jaffa, the members of which are engaged in commercial pursuits in that toAvn, and are doing well. Since I last visited this place emigrant Jews from Russia and Roumania have established no fewer than four colonies in its neighbourhood, which, hoAvever, are scattered in dif ferent directions at distances of se\\-eral miles apart. The circumstances under which my journey Avas made prevented me, unfortunately, from inspecting them as thoroughly as I could have desired. Two of these are under the protection of Baron Rothschild, and enjoy such pecuniary support from him as will secure their future, in spite of the obstacles which, owing to government opposition and other local difficulties, they have had to encounter. So far as energy, industry, and aptitude for agricultural pursuits are con cerned, the absence of Avhich has always been alleged as the reason Avhy no Jewish colony could succeed, the experience of more than tAvo years has now proved that such apprehen sions are groundless, and that with a fair chance Jews make very good colonists, and are likely, in fact, to succeed better in this country as agriculturists than in America, Avhere they have the skilled industry and indomitable energy of the American farmer to compete with, instead of the helpless ignorance and ingrained indolence of the native fellahin, who are their only rivals here. Besides these two colonies there are two others, one of which has been struggling on unaided for the last seven years, and which has latterly almost succumbed to the methods AA-hich have been resorted to by the government to extinguish it, but which has within the last month derived fresh aid and encouragement from the visit of Dr. Adler, the Grand Rabbi of London, and Mr. Wissotsky, the delegate of a society which has recently been formed in Poland, called \"The"], [301, "PROGRESS EVEN IN PALESTINE. 287 Lovers of Israel.\" The visit of these two gentlemen marks a new era in the fortunes of the Petach Tikveh colony, as it is called, as it resulted in the substantial*donation of a sum of \u00a3300, and in bringing it to the knowledge of the public. One of the chief drawbacks of the colony has been the un healthiness of its site, and the purchase of a healthy hill-top, about half an hour distant, has been attended with so much difficulty that it is only now that the colonists have at last secured their title to it sufficiently to warrant the building of houses upon it. Besides these four Jewish and two German colonies there has been for fifteen years established in the neighbourhood of Jaffa a large Jewish agricultural college, Avhich was founded by the Israelite Alliance, for the purpose of edu cating Jewish youths in agricultural pursuits. It is a hand some and extensiA-e building, standing a little to the right of the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, amid groves of trees and gardens, and surrounded by a fine tract of arable land. Here are avenues of eucalypti and of bamboos, both trees unknown in this country, and Avhich, from their novelty, form a striking feature in the plantations near the house. For many years this establishment was a source of permanent ex pense to its founders, and it was feared that the results Avould never justify the original outlay. Their perseverance has, however, met Avith its reAvard. The increase of the an nual income last year amounted to $5000. One of the prin cipal sources of revenue are the etkrogim, or gigantic citrons, Avhich are used by the JeAvs all over Europe at some of their religious festivals, and which, if they can be guaranteed as coming from the Holy Land, command a fictitious price. Besides these they export oranges and vegetables, and have engaged in the manufacture of wines and brandy, for which they find a good sale. It is to be hoped that as JeAvish colonies in Palestine increase, and the demand for skilled Jewish agriculturists conversant with the local methods of cultivation and familiar with the language is augmented, a better opening will be found for the youths who have re ceived their education in this establishment. Hitherto the young men, after receiving a good education, of which agri cultural science only formed part, have generally seen their"], [302, "HAIFA. 288 way on leaving the college to engage in some more profit able and congenial pursuits than tilling the land. As a rule, middle-aged men with a limited education and large families make better agriculturists than ambitious and well-educated youths. There is a fifth colony in Judea, which is nearer to Jeru salem than Jaffa, formed of Jews who have apparently been hired to become Christians, by being provided for as colonists; but so far it has proved a failure. The government has re fused all permission to build. They are at present living in a large Avooden shanty, and are said to be reverting to their old faith, as they find that the neAV one does not pay. I have also heard of a sixth colony which is in process of formation, so that adding to these three which are in Galilee, there are altogether nine Jewish colonies noAV in Palestine \u2014 all of which, with one exception, have been established within the last tAvo years and a half, in spite of difficulties which would have discouraged people animated by no higher senti ment than that of merely finding a living. However slow and uncertain their progress may be noAV, these first settlers may console themselves by the reflection that their experi ence as pioneers will be of incalculable value to their suc cessors, when altered conditions may arise, Avhich shall offer increased inducement to emigration. Meantime, it is as Avell that intending immigrants should not be misled by the delusive reports which are promulgated from time to time of a change in the policy of the govern ment in this respect. Practically the opposition to Jewish colonization on the part of the authorities is as stringent as ever, and any action taken upon a contrary hypothesis will only lead to disappointment. This increasing tendency to flock into the Holy Land is not confined, however, to Jews alone. There is an annual augmentation in the number of pilgrims Avho invade it, of nearly all the Christian sects, besides those who establish themselves here under the influence of various religious hob bies. Thus the foreign and Jewish population of this prov ince is constantly increasing, and the effect of this influx is more strikingly marked at Jerusalem than elseAvhere; but it is natural that Jaffa, as the port of Judea, should also large-"], [303, "PROGRESS EVEN IN PALESTINE. 289 ly have benefited by its influence, and I was much struck by the groAvth of the place and the signs of its increasing pros perity. This is, no doubt, due also in some measure to the excellent carriage-road which noAV connects it Avith Jerusa lem. I saw several large gangs of men at work upon those sections which still remain of the old rough track, which in former days made the journey between these places upon wheels a positive torture. It is true that many excruciating ly rough places still remain, but another year will remove them, and it is the intention of the present governor to ex tend the road from Jerusalem by Avay of Bethlehem (it is noAV almost completed to the latter place) to Hebron, and also to connect the rich country east of the Jordan with Judea by a carriage-road Avhich is in immediate contempla tion from Jerusalem to Jericho. The rapidly improving facilities for travelling in Pales tine, the annual increase in the number of tourists who each year visit it, the numerous ecclesiastical and charitable es tablishments Avhich have been already constructed and are yearly extended, the influx of foreign capital resulting there from, and the increase of the foreign population, both Jew and Christian, all tend to give Palestine an exceptional posi tion as a province in the Turkish empire. It is the only one, indeed, Avhere the evidences of progress are steady and sub stantial; and there can be no doubt that one of the most marked results of this progress will be the importance Avhich the Holy Land is destined to assume in the event of the Eastern question being reopened, for there is no province in the empire upon Avhich political and religious interests of so varied and universal a nature are concentrated. 19"], [304, "THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GEZER. Jerusalem, June 23. \u2014 I was much struck on my way from Jaffa to this place the other day by contrasting the different systems which are resorted to by the varied races of for eigners who are invading Palestine. There is the Jew, Avith curling ear-locks and greasy gaberdine, and wallet slung over his shoulder, trudging painfully along the dusty road. He has had hard work to slip into the country at all, and has only succeeded probably by means of backshish and a false passport. He has undergone discomfort and privations in numerable to Avin the privilege, which, to judge by his wan and sickly face, is not likely long to be denied him, of dying in Jerusalem. As he plods on, leaning Avearily on his long staff, he is al most run over by a bright yellow barouche dashing along the road, Avith four horses, in a style Avhich shows how rapidly Western civilization is striding into the East. It is an Eng lish duke \"doing\" Palestine. He is followed by a motley group of his own country men and women, mounted on horses and donkeys, the women for the most part apparently old maids in straw hats, green spectacles, and veils, while a large proportion of the men are evidently parsons, who wear cleri cal coats and Avaistcoats and unclerical pith hats and jack boots. The whole party, consisting of about thirty persons, white with dust, are preceded by an elaborately attired dragoman, Avhom they are about to follow over the country like a flock of sheep, for they are the last batch of the season of Cook's tourists. But they were not to be compared for picturesqueness or singularity of appearance with the next cortege which I overtook, and the aspect of Avhich, from a distance, puzzled me excessively. There appeared in front of me a large ob ject of some sort, which was being slowly dragged along by"], [305, "THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GEZER. 291 a croAvd of people who were evidently not natives of the country. On reaching it I found that it was a huge bell, weighing seven or eight tons, most elaborately ornamented with scriptural and sacred designs in basso-rilievo, and which, placed on a truck Avith Ioav wheels, was being hauled by about eighty Russian peasants, more than half of whom were women. Looking on this singular group of rugged featured people, with their light hair and Kalmuck coun tenances, one felt suddenly transported from the hills of Palestine to the steppes of Southern Russia. The men wore high boots, baggy trousers, long full-skirted coats, tight at the waist, and flat caps, and the women the sombre and dowdy habiliments common to the Russian peasant class. They were all yoked by the breast with ropes to the truck, tug ging it slowly but cheerfully along, and when I stopped and tried to stammer out the feAV words of Russian Avhich I still remembered, they greeted my attempts Avith loud shouts of laughter, and made explanations which my knoAvledge of the language Avas too limited to enable me to comprehend. But my curiosity was destined to be satisfied at a later period on the arrival of this precious burden at Jerusalem. Meantime I could not but regard with interest the eager devotion of these poor people, and especially of the women, Avho were thus satisfying a religious instinct by exercising the func tions of draught animals, and toiling up the road they deemed so sacred to the holy city, which is invested with a higher sanctity to the adherents of the Greek rite than to those of any other Christian communion. I found afterwards that it took them just a week to drag their bell up to Jeru salem, many falling ill by the way, and one dying, and rein forcements had to be sent from Jerusalem to assist them. Had it not been for the various houses which have been built for the accommodation of travellers the mortality would probably have been greater, but the increase of travel along this road has multiplied the number of rest-houses, and there are now four or five of various degrees of excel lence, to say nothing of Greek and Catholic convents, more or less far from the road, to which pilgrims can resort. The new hotel which has just been put up by a German colonist at Ramlch is among the most conspicuous of these improve-"], [306, "HAIFA 292 ments; and here, as the place is one of some arch\u00e6ological interest, and I thought the enterprise of my host deserved to be encouraged, I stayed to pass the night. In the centuries immediately subsequent to the crusades, Ramleh is often mentioned by the old chroniclers, for it was then, as now, a favorite resting-place for travellers and pil grims on their way between Jaffa and Jerusalem. But it gradually fell into decay, and three hundred years ago, when the traveller Belon was there, he found it almost deserted, scarcely tAvelve houses being inhabited, and the fields mostly untilled. It is now one of the most go-ahead places in Palestine, containing a population of at least five thousand, and is surrounded by extensive gardens and oliA-e groves, above which the lofty tower erected by the Sultan Bibars, in the thirteenth century, conspicuously rears its graceful proportions. By far the most interesting spot, hoAvever, in the whole of this section of country lies about two miles to the right of the road from Ramleh to Jerusalem, an hour after leaving the former place, which places it as much out of the track of tourists as if it were a day's journey. It is a mound called Tell el-Gezer, at the village of Abu Shusheh. This village is the property of a Mr. Bergheim, a JeAV banker of Jerusalem, who owns an estate here of about five thousand acres, from which I may say, en passant, that he derives a \\Tery large revenue.* Apart from the interest of the fact of a JeAV be ing so large a landed proprietor in Palestine, Abu Shusheh has claims upon our notice which have only recently been discovered, and Avhich to those who have been bitten with the enthusiasm of elucidating the ancient topography of Palestine, and identifying its antique sites, is replete with the highest importance. Among those who have devoted themselves to the study of Palestine geography and antiquarian research the French savant Monsieur Clermont Ganueau ranks second to none. One of the problems which has for many years excited the interest and curiosity of Palestine explorers was the where- * Since the above was written Mr. Bergheim has been brutally murdered by the peasants on his estate."], [307, "THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GEZER. 293 abouts of the ancient city of Gezer. We gather from the Biblical record that this was an important town prior to the arrival and settlement of the Israelites in the country. In the book of Joshua it is classed among the royal cities of Canaan. Its king, Horam, Avas defeated by Joshua Avhile at tempting to relieve Lachish, Avhich was besieged by the Is raelites. Later it was included in the territory of the tribe of Ephraim, and assigned to the Levitical family of Kohath. It is mentioned several times during the wars between David and the Philistines, and during Solomon's reign one of the Pharaohs made an expedition against it, Avhich resulted in the capture and burning of the town. It afterwards became part of the dowry of Pharaoh's daughter when she became Solomon's Avife, and he rebuilt it. The last Ave hear of it Avas in the wars of the Maccabees, when it reappears under the name of Gazara. Taken by assault in the first instance by the JeAvs, it passed successively into the hands of the two contending parties, who attached equal importance to its possession. John Hyrcanus, the Jewish commander, made it his military residence. It was during his study of the old Arab geographers that M. Clermont Ganneau came upon the name Tell el-Gezer, and finding that it met all the topographical requirements of the Bible, he went in search of it at Abu Shusheh. Here he found that a mound on Mr. Bergheim's property was knoAvn to the natives by that name, though it was too insignificant ever to have figured on any map. On making minute in vestigation, he discovered, to his delight, a bilingual inscrip tion ; the first word, in Greek characters of the classical epoch, was tha name of a man, \" Alkio,\" immediately followed by Hebrew letters of ancient square form, the translation of which was \" limit of Gezer.\" This settled the question, and the English Palestine Exploration Fund at once sent a spe cial mission to A-erify Monsieur Ganneau's discoveries. This they did most completely, finding four other inscriptions, besides making a most complete survey of the place. As is not uncommon Avith such very ancient remains, the first as pect of the spot is disappointing. There are, in fact, no ruins \\-isible, with the exception of a few terraces on the Tell, consisting of large blocks of unhewn stone. The Tell"], [308, "294 HAIFA. itself, on which part of the city appears to have stood, is a sort of ridge about six hundred yards long, one hundred across, and two hundred and fifty feet above the surround ing rocky valleys. The foundations of the ancient houses may be traced possibly in the numerous rock-cuttings with Avhich the place abounds, but it is difficult to distinguish them from cuttings for quarrying stone on the old method, and certainly many of the cuttings were those of quarriers. There are the remains of what Avas apparently an old fortress at the eastern end of the Tell, but the most remarkable features are the numerous wine-presses, Avhich number about thirty, some of them in an excellent state of preservation. There are also some tombs, but these are rare and scattered, Avhich is to be accounted for by the fact that this Avas a Le vitical city, Avithin the limits of which no interment was al loAved. There are numerous chips of stone, some apparently basaltic, and much broken pottery all over the Tell, and many flints, some of which Avere worked, haA-e been discov ered. While he was building his house, Avhich is just under the Tell, Mr. Bergheim found a deep cistern about forty feet square, lined with small stones and coA-ered Avith two coats of cement, which Avas hard and white; the Avails were about two feet thick, and it seemed to have a niche in its eastern Avail, as though it had at one time been used as a chapel. In the niche a cross was found, painted red, and beneath it a stone altar, Avhich has been removed ; but all this points to an early Christian occupation. Mr. Bergheim has since con verted the cistern to its original use. He also found a curious idol in hard red pottery. The fellahin say that many of these \"dolls,\" as they call them, used to be picked up, and Avere giAren to the children as playthings. Flint in struments, earthenware Aveights, and rubbers in composition, for use in cementing cisterns, have been found in ploughing on the Tell, and near its southwest extremity a number of skeletons Avere discovered, apparently of persons slain in bat tle; one had a sword-cut on the skull. An aqueduct cut in the rock is also traceable along the hillside. Altogether the place is a good deal more interesting than it looks at first sight, and had its owner been an antiquary he would doubtless have had splendid opportunities of mak-"], [309, "THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GEZER. 295 ing a ATaluable collection. That the spot has always had a semi-sacred character in the eyes of the country peopile is evident from the traditions which attach to it. One is that the city of Noah stood upon the hill here, and that the deluge came from a place called Et Tannar, which is a cavity with an old well on the east slope of the hill. The modern name Abu Shusheh, or \" Father of the Topknot,\" is said to be de rived from a dervish Avho prayed for rain in time of drought, and was told by a sand diviner that he Avould perish if it came. The Avater came out of the earth and formed a pool, into which he stepped and Avas drowned. The people, seeing only his topknot left, cried, \" Ya Abu Shusheh\" (O Father of the Topknot). It is a pity that, Avith the exception of the one deciphered by Monsieur Ganneau, the inscriptions are so much effaced that, although certain characters can be made out, they have hitherto defied translation. Some of them appear to ap proach to the later Hebrew forms, while others bear some resemblance to Cufic. There are other sites of interest which lie more or less dis tant from the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, but I had not time to visit them, though the comparatively more advanced state of civilization of this province and the good accommo dation to be found on the road Avould facilitate the explorer's task. On the other hand, the examination of this part of the country has been so thorough that he cannot hope for the rich rewards that are to be found in more inaccessible districts."], [310, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. Haifa, July 20. \u2014 It is a melancholy reflection, and one by no means creditable to the Christianity which preA'ailed in the fourth century after Christ, that the Jerusalem of the present day, the Holy City of the world par excellence, should contain within its walls more sacred shams and im postures than any other city in the world. The responsi bility for the gross superstition which prevails in regard to sites and localities mainly rests Avith the fourth century, and chiefly with the Empress Helena, who was principally instru mental in inventing them, and the Christian churches, espe cially the Greek and Latin, find it in their interest to foster these transparent frauds, for the enormous pecuniary advan tages which accrue from them. The extraordinary amount of research and investigation of which Jerusalem has been the subject during the last twenty years, the extent of the excavations which have been made, involving an expenditure of about $100,000, and the conscientious impartiality and profound acquirements of the explorers, have demolished the whole superstructure which early and medi\u00e6val Christianity had reared upon the cre dulity of its votaries; and Avhich the churches of the present day, despite all the evidences to the contrary, find it in their interest to perpetuate. Thus it has now been proved to demonstration that, wherever the tomb in which Christ was laid after his crucifixion may have been, it could not have been in the cave oA-er which the gorgeous edifice called the Church of the Holy Sepulchre now stands ; for we now know by recent examination the position of the walls which enclosed the city in the time of Christ, though some still deny the correctness of the latest conclusions which have been arrived at. We also know that Calvary, or Golgotha, where he Avas crucified, was \" nigh at hand \" to the sepul chre ; that Golgotha was \" nigh to the city,\" and not in it,"], [311, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. 297 and that Jesus \"suffered without the gate,\" and that all tombs, saving those of David and Huldah and eight Jewish kings, were without the Avails, while the cave over which the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is built is Avithin them. As, hoAvever, even the churches do not go so far as to maintain that any tradition had been preserved among Christians dur ing the first three centuries after the death of Christ of his place of burial, they have had to resort to inspiration as the means of its discovery. Some of the early writers maintain that it was the Emperor Constantine himself Avho Avas divine ly inspired to find it ; others that it Avas his mother, the Em press Helena. This is a trifling discrepancy. Whichever it was, the fact of the inspiration remains, and scientific investigation has, ever since the days of Galileo, been bound to give way before ecclesiastical inspiration and infallibility. So, no matter whatever evidences exist to the contrary, crowds of pilgrims will continue to crawl over those sancti fied stones, wearing them hollow Avith their kisses, as long as the sacerdotal organization of which it is the representa tive remains to impose upon them its authority. With considerate ingenuity, and possibly with a vieAV to lightening the labors of the pilgrims as much as possible, the early Church crowded as many sacred stones together under the roof of the holy edifice as it could with decency. Thus avc have the Stone of Unction, on Avhich Christ's body was laid for anointing, but it was getting so worn that the real stone lies beloAV the marble slab, which, however, an swers the purpose for the pilgrims. Close by is the Circular Stone, where the Virgin stood while the body was being anointed ; also the stone on Avhich Jesus stood when he appeared to Mary Magdalene, and the stone on Avhich she stood, and the column to which he Avas bound Avhen scourged; and your devout guide will shoAV you, if you haAre the pa tience to attend to him, the exact place where Jesus Avas stripped by the soldiers, the place Avhere the purple robe was put on him, the place where the soldiers cast lots for his raiment, the rent in the rock made by the earthquake, the place where his body was wrapped in linen cloths, the place where he indicated with his own hand the centre of the world, and so on, ad nauseam."], [312, "298 HAIFA Sometimes another Church commits a burglary and steals some of these stones. The Armenians have been especially guilty in this respect. They have stolen from the holy sepul chre the stone on Avhich the angel sat, that had been rolled away from the door of the sepulchre, which they now dis play in the chapel of the Palace of Caiaphas; also a piece of the true cross, which was originally discovered under inspira tion by Helena, as well as that of the penitent thief, who is noAV canonized under the name of Dimas. I don't know what authority they have for calling him Dimas, Avhose reputed birthplace is, for political reasons, going to be con verted into another holy place. There is something rather appropriate in the idea of the power that is Avaiting for a chance to despoil the Turkish empire of Syria erecting a shrine in worship of the penitent thief. The most remarkable sites are those which illustrate the parables. Thus, pilgrims are shown the AvindoAV Avhich was the post of observation of Div-es, and the stone, now worn by the kisses of the faithful, where Lazarus sat Avhen the dog licked his sores. I asked my guide where the dog was, but he said he was dead, and added, with a smile, \" I don't believe any of these things.\" I asked him Avhy not. \" Oh,\" he replied, \" I'm a Jew.\" After that the glibness with which he pattered off all the Christian traditions was Arery edifying until my patience was exhausted, and I said, \" Well, supposing, as we neither of us believe in any of these invented sites, we go and try ar.d find something that is real.\" He had been in the service of some of the recent Jerusa lem explorers, and I afterwards found him an intelligent companion. It is a striking illustration of Moslem religious toleration, as compared with that shown by Christians in Jerusalem towards Jews, that AA-hile this man could accompany me into the Mosque of Omar, that most beautiful and sacred of Mo hammedan temples, he was not allowed even to enter the street in Avhich stands the Christian Church of the Holy Sepulchre. So far as Christian rites are concerned, it may, then, be"], [313, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. 299 taken as a fact that the interest A\\Thich attaches to Jerusalem has but a A-ery slender relation to them. The great natural features, of course, must ahvays remain. Bethlehem, Beth any, and the Mount of Olives are as they ever were, but there are two Gardens of Gethsemane, one claimed by the Latins and one by the Greeks. When we descend to more minute details they are either purely mythical or at best only matters of vague conjecture. One of the best illustra tions of the purely mythical is Christ's footprint on the rock from which he ascended into heaven, which is a good deal smaller than that of Buddha, which I have also seen on the top of Adam's Peak in Ceylon, or of Jethro, Avhich the Druses shoAved me in the Neby Schaib. Among those open to conjecture, the position of Calvary and the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea are points upon which research may still throw light. Every indication goes to show that Golgotha, or Calvary, was a knoll outside the Da mascus gate, exactly in the opposite direction to that affixed by Christian tradition, and which would do aAvay Avith the Via Dolorosa as a sacred thoroughfare, the street shown as that along which Christ bore his cross on his way to execu tion. It is only probable that Calvary Avas the ordinary execution ground of Jerusalem, which is called in the Tal mud \"the House of Stoning \" about a.d. 150, and Avhich current tradition among the Jews identifies Avith this knoll, a tradition borne out by the account of it contained in the Mishnah, or text of the Talmud, Avhich describes a cliff over Avhich the condemned was thrown by the first witness. If he Avas not killed by the fall, the second witness cast a stone on him, and the crowd on the cliff or beneath it com pleted his execution. It was outside the gate, at some dis tance from the Judgment Hall. The knoll in question is just outside the gate, Avith a cliff about fifty feet high. Moreover, Ave are informed that sometimes \"they sunk a beam in the ground, and a crossbeam extended from it, and they bound his hands, one over the other, and hung him up.\" (Sanhedrim vi. 4.) Thus the House of Stoning was a recognized place of crucifixion. It is curious that an early Christian tradition pointed to this site as the place of ston ing of Stephen, the proto-martyr. The vicinity has appar-"], [314, "HAIFA 300 ently always been considered unlucky. An Arab writer in the Middle Ages pronounces a barren tract adjoining ac cursed and haunted, so that the traveller should not pass it at night. The Valley of Judgment (or Jehosaphat), which the Arab calls the Valley of Hell, passes not far east of the knoll, the Arab name of which is Heirimayeh, probably from a cave in the knoll called Jeremiah's grotto. The idea that this was in fact the Place of the Skull was warmly adopted by the late heroic defender of Khartoum, General Gordon, Avho spient the year before he went on his fatal mission to the Soudan in investigating points bearing on these subjects as tending to uphold theories which he held in regard to them, and which he explained to me at great length. Be fore leaving England he sent some notes on these to the Palestine Exploration Fund, and in their last quarterly statement these are published. They are full of pathetic interest now. In regard to the Place of the Skull, General Gordon says that \" the mention of the Place of the Skull in each of the four Gospels is a call to attention. Whenever a mention of any particular is made frequently we may rely there is something in it. If the skull is mentioned four times, one naturally looks for the body, and if you take Warren's or other contours, Avith the earth or rubbish removed, show ing the natural state of the land, you cannot help seeing that there is a body, that the conduit (discovered by Shick) is the \u0153sophagus, that the quarries are the chest, and if you are venturesome you will carry out the analogy further. You find in the verse in the Psalms, ' Zion on the sides of the North,' the word 'pleura,' the same as they 'pierced his pleuron, and there came forth blood and water.' God took a pleuron from the side of Adam and made woman. Noav the Church of Christ is made up of or came from his pleura. The stones of the Temple came from the quarries, or chest of the figure, and so on. So that fixed the figure of the body to the skull.\" This theory led to Gordon's forming a singular and mys tical conception of the emblematic character of the city as typifying in actual configuration the NeAv Jerusalem, the divine bride."], [315, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. 301 The most interesting fact, however, in connection with this knoll is the recent discovery upon it of a tomb, which has excited considerable interest as being, from its position, more likely to be the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, in which never man had been laid before Christ, than any hitherto known. From the knoAvledge we have now acquired of rock-cut tombs in Palestine we are able to judge from its appearance and construction its probable date, and these all go to prove that it belongs to the later Jewish period, or that Avhich terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem. The appearance of this tomb so near the old place of exe cution, and so far from the other tombs in the old ceme teries \"of the city, is very remarkable. A careful plan of the site and tomb has been made by Lieutenant Mantel], R. E., and sent to England, Avhere the subject has lately afforded matter for discussion. The reason Avhy the tomb Avas not found by the early Christians in their search for it at the time of Constantine is easy to be accounted for by the fact that, about ten years after the crucifixion, the \" Women's Towers \" Avere built by Agrippa upon the rock over the tomb, and it must have been hidden beneath or within the new building. Under these circumstances the sepulchre could no longer be visited, and in course of time its existence was forgotten, until the Empress Helena de stroyed the temple to Venus which the Romans had built on the present site of the Holy Sepulchre Church, and \" be yond all hope\" (as Eusebius words it), discovered the rock cut Jewish tomb, Avhich the faithful accepted as the tomb of Christ. A peculiar interest does nevertheless attach to these ex tremely ancient tombs in the Holy Sepulchre Church, one of which is now appropriated to Nicodemus, the nature of which I Avill discuss in my next letter. It is extremely probable that either Constantine or Helena heard that tombs of a high sanctity stood beneath the Venus tem ple, and they thought they could not do better than take the most sacred tomb to Avhich tradition of any sort at tached, and call it the holy sepulchre. Modern iconoclas ticism and love of truth have, hoAvever, proved too strong for fourteen hundred years of unfounded tradition. If the"], [316, "302 HAIFA. churches had only taken half as much trouble to preserve the moral truths which are to be found in the teachings of Christ, as they have to preserve a cave in which he was never buried, the world would have been so much the bet ter instead of so much the worse for their exertions."], [317, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM\u2014 Continued. Haifa, August 3. \u2014 The discoveries which have been made in Jerusalem during the last feAV years, and the conclusions at which those Avho have most deeply studied the subject have arrived in consequence, render it extremely desirable that a neAV or revised description of the Holy City should be inserted in the tourists' hand-books for Syria and Pales tine. Travellers should be warned against dragomans who waste their time taking them to see Christian sites which have no relation to the facts they are supposed to commem orate, and possess no interest of any kind beyond the philo sophical one that they illustrate the extraordinary credulity and superstitions Avhich exist among the professors of Chris tianity in the nineteenth century, and which are certainly not exceeded, even if they are paralleled, by those of any heathen religion. A Jerusalem hand-book, to be of any interest, should deal Avith the conclusions resulting from the excavations and re searches of Sir Charles Wilson, Sir Chai-les Warren, Captain Conder, M. Clermont Ganneau, and others, during the last twenty years, and leave the traditions of the Latin and Greek churches almost out of the question altogether. Their researches have settled nearly all the topographical questions connected Avith ancient Jerusalem, Avhich had pre viously been the subject of so much controversy and error, the doubts and difficulties connected with them arising from the fact that the city had been more or less destroyed and built over so many times that the original foundations of its walls and Temple could only be determined by extensive and laborious excavations; and in the course of these many col lateral discoveries were made. We learn from the publications of the Palestine Explora-"], [318, "304 HAIFA. tion Fund that these excavations were carried on under dif ficulties of every kind, in face of the opposition of the local government and in spite of continued fevers and lack of funds. The mines Avere driven to extraordinary depths; one at the southeast angle of the Haram being eighty feet deep, and another, near the northeast angle, being one hundred and twenty feet beneath the surface, where it reaches the solid rock. In consequence of the great depths, the scarcity of the mining frames, and the treacherous character of the debris through Avhich the shafts and galleries were driven, the work was one of unusual danger and difficulty, requiring much courage and determination. Sir Charles Warren and the non-commissioned officers of his staff worked constantly Avith their lives in their hands, and often undertook opera tions from Avhich the native workmen recoiled. The pru dence and discipline of the partyr, however, secured valuable discoveries without an accident; and it is generally acknowl edged that the results are of an importance which fully re pays the labor and difficulty of the operations. Sir Charles Warren was the officer who so courageously entered the desert of Sinai after the late Egyptian Avar, when he succeeded in capturing the murderers of Professor Pal mer, Captain Gill, and Lieutenant Sharrington, and bringing them to justice. The result of his labors in Jerusalem, and that of his fellow-explorers, is a magnificent atlas, published last year by the Palestine Exploration Fund, containing a most elaborate series of maps, plans, elevations, and engrav ings, which reproduce the sacred city in all its most striking features, accompanied by a handsome A-olume of descriptive matter. We are thus able to base an account of the ancient topography of the city on data more exact than any pre viously acquired, and to read the ancient historic accounts by the light of ascertained facts, instead of guessing at probabilities by the aid of descriptions, which, however care fully written, are still, as all descriptions must be, vague where the student requires most exactitude, and deficient where he most wishes for details. With the assistance of these publications a guide-book might be compiled which would enable the tourist to order his dragoman to take him straight to the places worth see-"], [319, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. 305 ing, instead of \u2014 folloAvingon the track of exploded tradition \u2014 going Avith him like a sheep to those that are not. Much could be done to clear away existing confusion and prevent the perpetuation of error by a change in the received nomen clature, Avhereby things should be called by their right names so far as they are known, instead of by misleading appella tions, derived from the records of early pilgrims or the later crusaders. I will take a feAv examples as illustrations. Not far from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre the guide shows the traveller an immense reservoir, noAV being filled up. This, he says, is the Pool of Bethesda, but it has only been thus designated since the fourteenth century. In the tAvelfth this pool Avas supposed to be a cistern near the Church of St. Anne, and in the fourth the site of Bethesda was shown at the twin pools, nortliAvest of Antonia. The fact is that there are only two sites Avhich may be regarded as possible for Bethesda, one being the spring of En-Rogel, which has an intermittent ebb and flow, and Avhich is still frequented by the Jews, who bathe in it to cure various diseases. The other is the curious Avell immediately west of the Temple enclosure, now called Hamman Esh-Shefa, or the Healing Spring, a long reservoir reached by a shaft nearly one hun dred feet deep. None of the pools which have at various times been selected by tradition have any supply of living water, and none can well be supposed to have any intermit tent rise and fall, such as we understand by the moving of the waters. Again, take the tombs of Absalom and St. James. There is nothing whatever to connect the first with Absalom. The singular style of its architecture shows that it cannot be the pillar \"Absalom reared up for himself during his lifetime in the king's dale.\" M. Clermont Ganneau has made excava tions uncovering the bases and pedestals of the columns, all of which are purely Greek. Indeed, it is only since the twelfth century that it was called the tomb of Absalom at all. The author of the Jerusalem Itinerary calls it the tomb of Hezekiah, and Adamanus, in the seventh century, calls it the tomb of Jehoshaphat. It is possibly the monument of Alexander Jann\u00e6us spoken of by Josephus. So, too, the tomb of St. James has nothing to do Avith St. James; for 20"], [320, "306 HAIFA, there has lately been discovered on the facade an inscription in square Hebrew in so inaccessible a position as to have been only probably cut before the facade was completed, which mentions that the family of the Beni Hezir are buried there. This family of priests is mentioned in the Bible (1 Chron. xxiv. 15). The inscription seems to date from the first century before Christ. The so-called tomb of David is a vault over Avhich has been built a room, called the chamber in which the Feast of the Passover prior to the crucifixion is supposed to have taken place. Close to it is the Palace of Caiaphas, and in it is shoAA-n the spot where Peter stood when he denied his Master. Near it is the rock upon which the cock roosted Avhen he crw. The, \"rock,\" the \"spot,\" the \"palace,\" the \"C\u00e6 naculum,\" and the \"tomb\" all rest upon equally invalid au thority. As regards the tomb of David, we know that it Avas within the walls, together with those of eight other Jewish kings. That the place Avas apparently Avell known as late as the time of Christ we gather both from the Acts and Josephus. It is remarkable that one undisputed JeAvish tomb still exists in such a position as to have been certainly within the city of David. This is the so-called tomb of Nicodemus, and it is yet more remarkable that in its original condition, before it was partly destroyed, this tomb must have been just made to contain nine bodies, placed in kokim, or graves cut according to the oldest arrangement employed by the Jews. Josephus mentions as a peculiarity of the tombs of the kings that some of the coffins Avere buried be neath the surface, so as to be unseen even to those standing within the monument. Just such an arrangement exists in the tomb under consideration, the floor of Avhich is sunk so that the graves on one side are on a lower tier. It seems, therefore, quite possible that the Church of the Holy Sepul chre preserves the monument of the nine chief kings of Jerusalem. Of course, tradition, with its usual ignorance, places \"the tombs of the kings\" on the hill of the upper city, Avhere your guide takes you to see them, and Avhere there are no ancient tombs at all, the tombs there being of a date not earlier than the first century before Christ. A fine sarcophagus, with an Aramaic inscription, stating that"], [321, "TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM. 307 it held the body of a certain Queen Sara, was discovered in them. Though called by a wrong name, they are, neA'er theless, well worth visiting. As it is supposed by some au thorities that Helena, Queen of Adiabene, was also buried here, they might more properly be called the tombs of the queens. But the really great work which recent investigation has accomplished has mainly reference, not so much to such de tails as these, which must always remain more or less matters of speculation, as to the settlement of controversies affect ing the topographical questions connected with ancient Jeru salem. First, in regard to points upon Avhich all are now agreed. There is no doubt about the Mount of Olives and the brook Kedron. It is agreed that the Temple stood on the spur immediately west of the Kedron, and that the southern tongue of this spur was called Ophel. It is also agreed that the flat valley west of this spur is that to Avhich Josephus applies the name Tyrop\u00e6an, though there was a diversity as to the exact course of the valley, which has now been set at rest by the collection of the rock levels within the city. It is also agreed by all authorities that the high soutliAvestern hill, to which the name of Sion has been ap plied since the fourth century, is that Avhich Josephus calls the upper city, or upper Market Place. The site of the Pool of Siloam is also undisputed, and certain natural feat ures have been determined, which serve as data on which to construct the walls of the ancient city and fix the site and area of the Temple enclosure in the time of Herod. There is still some controversy in regard to the exact position and course of the city walls prior to its destruction by Titus, but this is chiefly maintained by those who are fatally affected in their religious sentiments. There is also a difference of opinion in regard to the area of the Temple building. Prac tically, however, this point has been settled by the great Aveight of authority on one side, which affirms that the pres ent Haram enclosure, in which are situated the mosque of Omar, and the sacred stone, represent the area of Herod's Temple, only one or two standing out for a restriction of this area. If the Turkish government would only allow ex plorations to be made under the platform of the dome of the"], [322, "308 HAIFA rock, the very rock upon Avhich Abraham is supposed to have been ordered to sacrifice Isaac, and if the examination of the closed chambers known to exist on the north and east sides of this platform could be carried out, the controversy might be set at rest by actual discovery. Of the Temple of Solo mon little is known, though it is possible that the great scarps in the present British cemetery may be as old as the time of David, or the eleventh century before Christ. They are, without doubt, the oldest existing remains in Jerusalem, and formed part of the ramparts of the upper city. Mean time, the most interesting spot which it contains, whether for Jew, Christian, or Mohammedan, is that mysterious dome of the rock, with its gorgeous mosque covering the sacred stone, which Christ himself must have regarded Avith as much veneration in his day as the adherents of the tAvo other religions, so widely opposed to the one of which he Avas the founder, do now."], [323, "PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM. Haifa, August 10. \u2014 There is probably no city in the do minions of the sultan which has undergone more change dur ing the last few years than Jerusalem, and as any change which implies progress, implies also the increase of foreign influence, and is always viewed Avith suspicion by the Porte, the march of events in Palestine is Avatched by Turkish statesmen with a jealousy which finds its expression in a persistent effort to oppose it. As, however, the basis of the movement to Avhich Jerusalem owes its increase during re cent years is a religious one, and is founded upon a senti ment which proverbially thrives by opposition, all efforts to retard the influx of population and capital into the Holy City have proved unavailing. OAving to increased facilities of travel, the pilgrimages both of the Greek and Latin churches have been more numerous. A new feature is that some of the richer pilgrims from time to time establish them selves here. This is especially the case with the Russian members of the Greek Church. The influx of Jews has also been increasing to a remarkable extent. The Protestant sects are constantly enlarging the field of their operations, and new charitable and educational establishments are springing up from year to year.1 An American society of Second Adventists has been resident here for some years, while isolated religious cranks find in the Holy City an ap propriate dwelling-place, for reasons known only to them selves. The result of all this is that whereas when I was last here, six years ago, only a very feAV houses had been built on the Jaffa road outside the walls of the tOAvn, now there is an extensive and constantly increasing Frank suburb. The price of land has risen fifty per cent., and is still constantly rising. NeAv hotels and shops have been opened to meet"], [324, "HAIFA 310 the increasing demand. Within the last twenty years the population of the Holy City has certainly doubled, the in crease consisting entirely of Jews and Christians. Apart from its sacred associations the city has no attractions as a residence of any kind, but quite the reverse. This fact pos sesses a highly important political significance, because it is evident that in the degree in which the vested interests of rival sects and religions accumulate upon this spiot is it destined some day to become a bone of contention betAveen them. It is probably the only city in the world where the same amount of capital and enterprise is expended on objects which are in no sense remunerative, while in proportion to its size there is none where a larger sum is annually given away, either in the form of charitable or religious donations^. Nothing strikes one more than the proportion of buildings having some sort of public character or other to private dwellings, and these buildings are constantly increasing. This year the estimated expenditure of the Greek and Latin churches will be over $600,000 for building purposes alone. The number of Russian pilgrims who visit Jerusalem annual ly is about five thousand, and it is constantly increasing. They are all accommodated in the extensive premises be longing to the Russian goA'ernment, in the centre of Avhich the Russian consulate is situated, and which forms a sort of Russian suburb to the Holy City. Here one feels trans ported for the time to the dominions of the czar, as he hears on all sides the Slav tongue, and finds himself jostled by men and Avomen in the peasant costume of their own country, chaffering over wares Avhich the more enterprising of their number have imported to sell to their own country people, while they squat in stalls and booths which they have rough ly extemporized for the purpose. When you consider the amount of foreign money which is annually expended in Jerusalem by these hosts of pilgrims \u2014 those of the Latin Church, hoAvever, do not equal in num ber those of the Greek \u2014 by the tourists and general influx of sightseers Avho flock here during Easter Aveek, and by the churches and societies in building operations, you cannot Avonder that many persons have of late years become wealthy, and that many natives of Syria and the Levant are attracted"], [325, "PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM. 311 to the tOAvn in the hope of becoming so. The tide having thus set in, it goes on increasing, and the rivalry of the Lat in and Greek churches imparts, as it Avere, a stimulus to the Avhole jumble of creeds and nationalities Avhich cluster round the sacred shrines. Among the latest and most interesting arrivals are a num ber of JeAvs from Yemen. Hitherto these little -known people had only been heard of, or at most seen, by one or tAvo enterprising travellers who have penetrated from Aden into the southern deserts of Arabia Felix. I Avas told that they consider themselves as belonging to the tribe of Dan. They have lately arrived as refugees in Jerusalem from Yemen, Avhere they have suffered great misery during the recent wars betAveen the Arab tribes which inhabit that prov ince and the Turkish troops. Finding themselves ultimately reduced to starvation by the plunder of Avhich they Avere the victims from both sides, they determined to seek shelter in the Holy City, Avhere they arrived in rags in a starving and destitute condition. They have since been provided for by subscriptions among their co-religionists raised in Europe. I met some of them one afternoon, doAvn at the Place of Wail ing, and Avas much struck by the mild and gentle expression of their countenances. They are reputed to be Avell versed in their own religious lore, and to be devout Avithout being hypocritical, Avhich is more than can be said for Palestinian Jews generally. Although they were themselves engaged in sedentary and commercial pursuits in Sana and other towns in the fertile oases of southern Arabia, they report that among the nomads of these deserts are wandering tribes in no wise, so far as their external appearance goes, to be distinguished from Arabs, but who are nevertheless purely Jewish. I also met while in Jerusalem a black JeAV from Cochin in India, where JeAvs have been established from time imme morial, but he seemed somewhat vague as to his ancestry. Among all these different nationalities and sects, which as a rule hold each other in holy abhorrence, it is singular that they all have one view in common, or rather, perhaps, it should be said that they all seem to labour under one im pression, or presentiment, and that is that before very long"], [326, "312 HAIFA the Holy City will undergo a change of some sort. The nature of this change naturally takes the form peculiar to the national or religious tendency of thought. With the Russians and French it is reduced to a very simple political expression, which may be summed up in the Avord annexa tion. This idea is more firmly fixed among the Russians than the French. Indeed, the Holy City plays a greater part in the Greek religion than it does in the Latin, and the affections of the orthodox are centred on these shrines to a degree nnknoAvn among Christians of any other denomina tion. There is hardly a village in Russia in which there is not to be found a bottle of Jordan water, and the devotional instincts of the peasantry, Avhich are very strong, are directed by the Church, Avhich is in Russia synonymous Avith the gov ernment, upon the holy places in Palestine, as shrines Avhich have a spiritual value not recognized by other churches to the same extent, and Avhich, therefore, when the day comes, should entitle it to their temporal and territorial proprietor ship. In other words, there is not a Russian pilgrim who visits Jerusalem Avho does not hope that he may live to see the day Avhen it will become a Russian city, and Avho does not long for the call to a holy war, the object of Avhich should be the exclusive possession by Russia of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and of the city in Avhich it stands.* In France there is no such religious enthusiasm, except with a section of society, and, although the conquest of Syria * Russia in Palestine. \u2014 The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Daily News says, \" In Palestine, the orthodox religion and Russian influence seem to be increasing. Some days ago ' The Orthodox Palestine Society ' celebrated its anniversary. It was made known on this occasion that the society \u2014 which is protected by the government, and which has one of the emperor's uncles, the Grand Duke Nicholas Nieolaievitch, as president \u2014 numbers already six hundred and fifteen members, and that its reserve capital amounts to about 90,000 roubles. The society has constructed a church at Nazareth, is con structing a church at MudsUile, and has bought a piece of ground at Jerusa lem. The leaders of the Palestine Society assert that their researches have proved in ' the most indubitable ' manner that Christ, on his way to Golgotha, ' passed just over the ground which has been bought by the society.' One of the society's tasks is to facilitate Russian pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The emperor has recently given his sanction to the establishment of branches of this society in all cities of the Russian Empire.\""], [327, "PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM. 313 and Palestine enters into the programme of the government, and their religious protectorate over the Latin Church and its interests gives them a strong point of departure, it is weakened by the fact that the government is professedly anti-Catholic, and that, even were it not so, the sentiment for the holy places is not so strong among the Latins as among the Greeks. With the Protestants there is a large class Avho base their belief in an immediately pending altera tion in the political conditions under which Jerusalem now exists, upon their interpretation of prophecy. They profess to find it clearly indicated in Ezekiel, Daniel, Revelations, and elsewhere in the Bible, that the protectorate of Pales tine is to be vested in England. Among the Jews there are many also, though they interpret the prophetic writings in a totally different sense, Avho believe that the fulfilment of the prophecy Avhich is to restore to them their ancient coun try, Avith its sacred city, is at hand, and all Moslem tradition points to the present time as one critical to the fortunes of Islam, Avith Avhich the fate of Jerusalem, which is to them also a holy city, is inextricably interwoven. Whether we have any sympathy with any of these views or not, the mere fact that so many nations and races of di verse religions, from one point of view or another, centre their political and religious aspirations upon this spot, makes it the most interesting city upon the earth's surface, because there is none other which, Avhen its possession comes to be disputed, Avill excite such powerful or such conflicting ambi tions, superstitions, and passions.! These considerations be come doubly interesting when we connect them with the eA-ents which are now transpiring in the East. One day Avhile I -was in Jerusalem the huge bell which I had seen dragged by Russian pilgrims along the road from Jaffa arrived. It Avas destined for a new Russian church Avhich has lately been built upon the Mount of Olives. Anxious to witness the ceremony of its reception, I set out for the Mount and reached the summit just in time to see the bronze monster, which I calculated weighed about eight tons, arrive at its destination. A large crowd of Russian men and women, headed by two priests of the Greek Church in full canonicals, and chanting sacred songs, were dragging"], [328, "314 HAIFA it to the platform from which it was to be finally elevated into the belfry prepared for it. When, after much pulling and hauling, it was at last placed upon the platform, a sol emn religious service took place. Every individual man and Avoman in the croAvd pressed forward to kiss the uplifted crucifix Avhich the priest presented for their adoration, cross ing and prostrating themselves, and crowding also around the bell to kiss the various sacred groups of figures repre sented upon it in basso-rilievo. At last, after a final melodi ous chant in which all joined with great earnestness, the officiating priest gave the signal for three cheers, Avhich was responded to with heartiness, and the ceremony was over. I noAV went to examine the interior of the new church which it was intended to decorate, and Avas glad to find that the accident which had led me to come here to witness the arrival of the bell was the means of introducing me to a new and interesting discovery of recent date. The Russians, in excavating for the foundations of their neAv church, came upon the pavement and other remains of an ancient building, which they have been careful to preserve. Many of the most interesting objects found are placed in a cabinet. In the hall of the priest's house adjoining the church is a beautiful tes sellated paA'ement, representing animals, fish, apples, and geometrical patterns, with an inscription in Armenian formed of colored tesser\u00e6. East of the gate into the garden, and close to the house, is a rock-cut chamber, with a vault of modern masonry. It measures about twenty-four feet by fourteen, and contains sixteen sarcophagi, arranged in groups of four, with a passage betAveen. These were closed by slabs, and on three inscriptions Avere dimly discernible. North of this Avere the foundations of a building, apparently a chapel, with a tessellated floor and a row of piers about two feet square. Near by is a cave with a modern \\-aulted chamber, and an iron door which has apparently been placed there to protect a long inscription in old Armenian characters, formed also of colored tesser\u00e6, but I have no means of know ing what it signifies. Beneath the floor of the house are said to be other tombs, which can be reached through a masonry trap-door. It is not unlikely that all these remains belong"], [329, "PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM. 315 to an Armenian medi\u00e6val monastery. The site, which has recently been acquired by the Russians, is some hundreds of yards distant from the highest part of Olivet, where the Latin chapel stands, usually visited by tourists Avho go there to see Christ's footprint. It commands a magnificent view, and the new Russian edifice will make an important addition to their rapidly groAving collection of sacred buildings. Nothing is more aggravating to the members of either the Greek or Latin churches than to find the rival sect in solitary possession of a holy place. It is the immediate signal for the purchase of another site as near as possible to the one already occupied, and the erection upon it of an opposition building. No greater piece of luck can befall the owner of a piece of land than to stumble upon remains which show that it had been in the occupation of the early Christians. He can then name his own price, and, like the fortunate pro prietor of the land on which St. Stephen's Church is now about to be built by the French, may get a thousand napo leons for Avhat he had a very short while before only7 paid fifty. Before bidding adieu to Jerusalem, it may be interesting to my readers that I should notice some of the more impor tant discoveries that have been made there within the last year or two, and which are not, therefore, to be found in any guide-book. For many of the details I am indebted to the Palestine Exploration Fund publications. Among these have been many tombs, some of them of much inter est, but none equal to that to which I have already alluded, as being the most likely of any which have yet been discov ered, to be the tomb of Christ. I have given at length the reasons in a former letter in support of this presumption. It is approached by a court cut in the rock seven feet square, and tAvo stones in this are so placed as to give the idea that they may have held in place a rolling stone before the door. On the right is a side entrance leading into a chamber with a single loculus, and thence into a cave eight feet by ten. If, instead of turning into this, we go straight on, we descend two steps into a chamber six feet by nine; from either side wall, and in the back wall of this chamber, are three low passages; they lead into three other small chambers, each"], [330, "HAIFA, 316 about seven feet long by six wide, and on each side of each are stone benches on which bodies could be placed, Avith a narrow passage between them ; so that, in fact, the Avhole tomb could contain six bodies. Whether it be the real Holy Sepulchre or not, it is interesting from the fact that it is the only Jewish tomb that has ever been found so close to the ramparts of the modern city on the north, and to the spot which may, with comparative certainty, be identified Avith Calvary. It stands not very far distant from a piece of land Avhich a man bought a year or so ago for fifty na poleons. On beginning to excavate for the foundations of his house he came upon some tessellated pavement, carvings, and all the evidences of remains of some importance. He lost no time in making his discovery known, and, finding that it stood upon Avhat must have been the site of the early Christian Church of St. Stephen, to commemorate the spot of his martyrdom, the Roman Catholics gave the man a thousand napoleons for his laud, and have laid bare the re mains Avith a view to building another church over them. I examined them with some interest, as it was such a recent discovery, though the historical interest only dates back to the year a.d. 460, when it Avas built by the Empress Eu doxia. The crusaders found it in ruins, since Avhich time it had become buried, and its site lost. The whole plan of the church can now be distinctly traced, its pavements in many places remaining perfect, Avith the foundations of its side walls, fragments of columns, etc. The two most interesting features in connection with it, hoAvever, are a slab of fine limestone on which are the figures of the twelve apostles, each surrounded by a sort of canopy. They stand six each side of a central figure of a throned Christ. The figures are rather stiffly drawn and have long robes; although they were very distinct when first discovered, instead of moving the slab under shelter, it has been left exposed to the storms of Avin ter; the result is that the outlines, which Avere in colour, can now scarcely be distinguished, and another year Avill com pletely efface them; besides this there is an inscription which has so far puzzled experts, though it is in Greek characters, but a good deal of it is effaced. There are also tombs in the vicinity, but though rock-cut they are evidently Christian."], [331, "PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM. 317 Recent excavations within the city have also exposed a vast area, depressed considerably below the present level of the surface, Avhich once formed the extensive establishment of the Knights Hospitallers, or Knights of St. John. It was given some time ago by the Turkish government to the Crown- Prince of Germany; since then the whole place has been cleared out with a view to its restoration on a grand scale, and it will doubtless form, when completed, one of the finest architectural monuments of modern date in Jerusalem. Sev eral very deep and finely-vaulted cisterns, with arches fifty feet high, have been brought to light, besides cloisters, cor ridors, and vaulted chambers hitherto unknown. Some idea of the scale of the establishment which these celebrated knights possessed in Jerusalem may be gathered from the character and extent of the ruins, which cover an area of one hundred and seventy square yards, of which only half, unfortunately, belongs to the German government. But the latest discovery, Avhich has excited the greatest interest, is that of the inscription in the tunnel Avhich con nects the Virgin's Fount with the Pool of Siloam. The ex ploration of this tunnel, which is about six hundred yards long, involved great danger and difficulty. Colonel, now Sir Charles Warren, gives a most graphic picture of the horrors of his experience. For some distance the passage Avas only one foot four inches high, and as there AA-as one foot of water, the explorers, who Avere crawling on their stomachs, naked, were submerged to their chins, having only four inches of breathing-room, Avith the additional danger of being drowned by the rising of the waters, which does not take place regularly. Often their mouths were under Avater, and a breath of air could only be obtained by twist ing their faces up. To keep a light burning, to take meas urements, and make observations under these circumstances Avas a Avork of no little difficulty ; and yet, after crawling through mud and water for four hours, the honour of finding the inscription was reserved for a naked urchin of the town, who, some years after, announced he had seen writing on the wall.

Now this is the history of the Tunnel.

And there flowed the waters from their outlet to the Pool, for a thou sand two hundred cubits, and ... of a cubit was the height of the rock over the heads of the excavators.\" From this it will appear that there were two working-parties, working from opposite ends, and the indefatigable explorers have actually discovered the spot where the \" excess \" in the rock occurred and where they probably met. Most people who have not got Palestine exploration on the brain will, however, be content to take their Avord for it without going to see for themselves. Still it cannot be denied that an engineering work, executed in the time of Solomon, and an inscription describing it, is of the greatest interest.

Haifa, Sept. 2. \u2014 The signs of progress to which I have al luded in former letters as being manifest in Judea are not confined to Jaffa and Jerusalem. The contemplated carriage road to Jericho Avill be an immense boon to the crowds of pilgrims Avho flock annually to the Jordan. The first evi dence of activity in this direction was at the Khan el-Ahmah. Here are the ruins of an old building. Fragments of walls and broken arches remain, and a deep well indicates that in former days it was inhabited \u2014 probably as a half-way house of entertainment. Whether this be so or not, I Avas glad to see a large force of stoue-masons and builders actively engaged, under the superintendence of a European, in erecting a hand some khan or rest-house, which, considering that there is not at present a single habitation betAveen Jerusalem and Jeri cho, with the exception of Bethany, distant only tAvo miles from the former city, is much needed. This place has always had an evil reputation for thieves since the days Avhen the Good Samaritan performed his charitable offices to the plundered and beaten Avayfarer. In deed, it is at this very place that the spot is shown to the credulous pilgrim where the incident in the parable is said to have occurred, and the guide-books solemnly warn the tourist that he must be careful to be provided Avith an escort, be cause an English traveller, Sir Frederick Henniker, was at tacked here by Bedouins, stripped, Avounded, and left for dead in 1820. This is imputing stagnation to the Turkish government with a vengeance. It moves slowly, it is true, but the state of security has improved somewhat in sixty five years. Six years ago I rode alone Avith a friend from Jericho to Jerusalem with no thought of danger. The Bedouins find it to their interest to keep up the traditions of the guide-books, and travellers continue to pay Bedouin"], [334, "HAIFA. 320 sheiks blackmail which they might Avith perfect confidence keep in their pockets. I consider the road from Jerusalem to Jericho in the present day as safe as Broadway, at all events in the daytime. It might not be safe to venture along it quite alone at night, but the same might be said of roads in other far more civilized countries. Nevertheless, the road in places is so wild and desolate that it may well appal the imagination of the timid traveller, notably so where it enters the Wady Kelt, a deep, narrow gorge, flanked by precipitous cliffs, honey combed Avith caverns, above which rise white chalk hills, presenting a tangled network of narrow Avater-worn torrent beds with knife-like ridges between. Hundreds of feet below the path rushes a mountain torrent, which is none other than the traditional brook Cheritt. Here, if we leave the regular track, and make up our minds to follow a dizzy path cut out of the precipitous cliff, which winds back up the gorge, soon disappearing in the depth of its gloomy recesses, Ave plunge into one of the wildest and Aveirdest scenes that the ingenu ity of nature has conceived in any country, so fantastic are the crags and so labyrinthine the gorges. The only travel lers Avho ever thus diverge from the beaten route are Rus sian pilgrims, whose devotional instincts lead them to pay their homage to every accessible shrine, and to the credit of the Greek Church it must be said that it has contrived to perch shrines on spots which nature only intended for eagles. One of the most notable of these is the monastery Avhich commemorates the cave, to which the path we are now following Avill lead us, in which Elijah is said to have been fed by the ravens. The monastery is literally hung on to the face of the precipice, and consists of a series of cells, and a hall supported on vaults through which lies the entrance. A few Greek monks live, like birds perched on the edge of a nest, in this singular abode, to which a chapel pinnacled on a rock is attached, dating, if we may judge from the character of the masonry, from about the twelfth century. Perhaps the little side chapel, with rock-cut chambers, and the vault containing ancient bones, to which a corridor covered with frescoes representing the Last Judgment leads, is the oldest part of these buildings, which were apparently constructed"], [335, "THE THREE JERICHOS. 321 at three different epochs, as two layers of frescoes cover the wall, Avhile the neAvest is in its turn covered by the piers sup porting the ribs of the roof. Numerous caves, now inacces sible, are visible in the face of the cliff, which for a distance of about thirty yards is covered wiiii frescoes now almost entirely defaced. In front of oue of the cells is a heavy iron bar, from which, no doubt, in former days a ladder de pended, the only means of access when these caves, hoav al most deserted, contained quite a population of hermits. This curious place is Avell Avorth a visit, and though lying so close to the tourist's route, I have not seen it described in any guide-book. On reaching the base of the hills where the Wady Kelt debouches into the Jordan Valley, we find ourselves in the immediate presence of four ancient sites. Three of these are the sites of three different Jerichos, and one is the site of Gilgal. It is certain that the Jewish, the Roman, and the Byzantine Crusaders' Jericho occupied three different posi tions. The first has been identified with tolerable certainty as having existed where mounds of rubble mark its site, near the spring called in old times the Fountain of Elijah, and knoAvn now as the Ain es-Sultan. This was the Jericho of Joshua, and these mounds of rubble may contain the debris of the identical Avails which fell to the sound of his trumpet. We pitched our tents at the beautiful and copious spring Avhich must have supplied the old town Avith water, so as to have an opportunity of examining the neighbourhood at our leisure. The spring comes out beneath the mound on the east, and has on the west a wall of small masonry in hard cement. In this wall there is a small semicircular niche, probably intended to hold a statue of the genius of the spring. The reservoir from Avhich the water gushes forth is about tAventy by forty feet, and, though shalloAv, forms a delight ful bath, with temperature slightly tepid. The high tumuli behind had been excavated by Sir Charles Warren, and I ex amined the traces of his cuttings. The mounds are formed for the most part of a light yelloAV clay, which, on being touched, crumbles into an impalpable powder. In some cases no strata could be discerned in the clay, in others, layers of brick, stone, and mortar were clearly visible. In another 21"], [336, "322 HAIFA large mound, a little to the south, graves were found six feet below the surface. All these except one were of sun-dried brick. Bones appeared to have been thrown into these after the decomposition of the bodies. Altogether Sir Charles Warren dug trenches through no fewer than eight of the mounds, which form a conspicuous feature in the plain in which the ancient cities of Jericho were situated, as they stand to a height of about sixty feet above it; and the re sult at which he arrived was that they are formed by the gradual crumbling away of great towers or castles of sun burned brick. Although in some cases shafts Avere sunk to a depth of forty feet, nothing was found except pottery jars, stone mortars for grinding corn, and broken glass. In one Avere found, eight feet beloAv the surface, the remains of a large amphora, the neck, handles, and base of which were en tire, and which must have stood about five feet high. Sir Charles Warren's working party consisted of one hundred and seventy-four men, and he thoroughly exhausted the sub ject- Near the spring is a ruin which may have been that of a small Roman temple, a portion of an aqueduct, for the waters of the spring evidently irrigated a large extent of the plain, and near by traces of ruins, apparently Byzantine. Here are pillar-shafts, cornices, capitals, and other indications of a city of later date than those we have been considering. The site of the Jericho of Herod, which existed at the time of Christ, was at the mouth of the Wady Kelt, deriv ing its Avater supply from that stream, and more than a mile from Ain es-Sultan. Here there are the remains of a bridge, foundations of buildings Avhich were evidently Roman work, and two large artificial mounds, in one of which Avas found a rectangular chamber, the outer wall built of sun-dried bricks, and the interior of undressed stones cemented over. The site of the third, or Crusading Jericho, was probably identical with that on Avhich the modern village of Jericho now stands; but no ruins of importance remain there, though the whole surface of the plain betAveen the sites of the three Jerichos is covered with remains which attest the denseness of the population which once inhabited it. That this should once have been a large inhabited centre must ever appear an"], [337, "THE THREE JERICHOS. 323 astounding fact to the modern traveller who has suffered from the heat of the plain. Except during the winter months all this region is not only unbearably hot, but most insalu brious. The very Arabs desert it for the hillsides. It is possible that neglect and inattention to irrigation works may make the climate much less healthy than it was in former times, but nothing can be changed in the matter of temperature, and either the population must have deserted it for the mountains during summer or they must haAre been far better able to bear heat than their degenerate descendants. Sunk nearly tAvelve hundred feet below the level of the sea, and shut in from all breeze by lofty ranges of barren moun tains on both sides, Jericho in summer must be one of the hottest places on the earth's surface. Even Jerusalem, which is four thousand feet above it, is pretty warm. On the other hand, Josephus vaunts the wonderful fertility of the place, and calls it \"a region fit for the gods.\" Its magnificent and extensive palm groves were celebrated, but these have disappeared since the eighth century, and there is only one date-tree left. Still the abundance of the water, the richness of the soil, and the warmth of the climate, won derfully adapt it to the growth of all tropical produce. All kinds of vegetables are in season all the year round. Grapes, Avhich are trellised on high poles, as in Italy, grow to enor mous size; indigo, cotton, and sugar would all flourish, but there are no people to cultivate them. The remains of the old aqueducts testify to the skilful manner in which the ancients used their abundant water supply for the irrigation of this extensive plain. I counted altogether nine different ancient aqueducts. One or two of these are still utilized, and of late years a handsome bridge has been built in connection Avith one of them, but the engi neering skill of the ancients holds its own with our more modern constructions. Many of the bridges by which these aqueducts span the ravines are \\-ery handsome. Some are on two tiers of arches, one above another. In places they are tunnelled through the hills. One bridge of massive ma sonry of large stones is one hundred and tAventy feet long and thirty-five feet high, with pointed arches. There is one aqueduct eight miles long, consisting of a cemented channel"], [338, "HAIFA 324 tAvo feet broad, and terminating in a handsome cemented cistern. It is carried over several bridges, one fifty feet long and thirty feet high. I mention this system of aqueducts because I have never seen any account of Jericho in the records of travellers or in guide-books which does justice to them. They are im portant as showing how much money must have been spent in developing the resources of this plain, and what a garden it must have been in old times. So late as the thirteenth century we hear that the sugar-cane was cultivated around Jericho, and I believe that at this day there are few spots on the earth's surface which could be turned to more profitable ac count. Here all the products of the tropics could be raised Avithout having to go to the tropics for them, and many fruits could be conveyed from here to a European market, which it would be impossible to preserve for the length of time which is now required to transport them from the trop ics. At a comparatively small expense the ancient system of aqueducts could be repaired and the abundant water sup ply utilized, which is now left to stagnate in marshes and breed fever and pestilence. It is, in fact, impossible to ap preciate the magnificent capabilities which this plain pos sesses and not feel convinced that in these day*-s of civilized enterprise the question of their development is only one of time."], [339, "JERICHO\u2014 A NEW WINTER RESORT. Haifa, Sept. 15. \u2014 When I last visited Jericho, six years ago, it consisted of a miserable village of mud huts, containing a population of mixed negroes and Bedouins, amounting at most to three hundred souls. I was aston ished now to find that, of all places in the world, it was going ahead. There Avas a sort of boom going on; a very minute boom, it is true, but still it Avas progress, and there is no saying Avhat it may lead to. It is due entirely to the Russians, and I think that a pro gressive Jericho, owing to Russian enterprise, is a phenom enon worthy of remark. Indirectly it may be attributed to the passion Russian pilgrims have for bathing in the Jordan and carrying away bottles full of the Avater of that sacred stream. This passion for holy ablutions is one which a Avise and far-seeing government has turned to profitable political account. It was only in obedience to the most ordinary in stincts of humanity that some sort of accommodation should be provided for the pious crowds, consisting largely of old and frail women, who trudge thirty miles in a broiling sun to bathe in the Jordan, and Avho could not find a roof to shelter them, or a place in which to be fed, until they got back to Jerusalem. So a large, handsome, red-stone building, not unlike a state lunatic asylum, has been erected for their accommodation at Jericho. Here not only the Russian pil grim, but the ordinary travelling lunatic, can find first-class accommodation. The protection which so handsome an establishment af forded Avas all that was required to give a start to the place. Devout Russians, always acting under the auspices of a pious, intelligent, and paternal government, are beginning gradually to make Jericho a place of Avinter resort. They build little cottages there, surround them with gardens"], [340, "326 HAIFA. which supply them Avith most delicious fruit and vegetables, spend their summers in Jerusalem, and come down here in the winter and bathe in the Jordan to their hearts' content. In other -words, in a religious and quite unostentatious way, Russia is quietly colonizing Jericho. The obnoxious word colony, so hateful to Turkish ears, is never pronounced, but I counted no fewer than twelve neat little Avhitewashed cot tages, where a feAV years ago there was not one. One of my travelling companions, Avho was an English medical man of some eminence, was so much struck with the climatic advantages of the place as a winter resort for consumptive patients that, noAV that good accommodation is to be found there, he has decided to advise invalids to try the effects of its air. Hitherto Avhen one told a person \"to go to Jericho \" it Avas a polite way of intimating to him that he might go somewhere else, Jericho being the next hottest place known to that more distant region; but now Ave may tell our friends to go to Jericho in a spirit of benevolence, in the hope that it may restore them to health. What an un bearable place, by the Avay, Jericho Avould be if all the bores who have been metaphorically sent there had literally gone. As it is, I cannot imagine a more agreeable place for a per son not absolutely dependent upon society to go to and spend a month or tAvo in winter. There is a peculiar softness and balminess in the air, not to be found elsewhere in the world, for there is no other place in the Avorld eleven hundred feet below the sea-line. There is a wide, level, open plain to soamper across on horse back in all directions; there are thickets of tamarisk and nebk and bamboo swarming Avith wild boar, deer, gazelle, and other animals, some of them not to be found elseAvhere, to delight the sportsman. There is the Jordan handy, with first-rate fishing to satisfy the most ardent angler; there is the Dead Sea to bathe in and boat on (only there are no boats) for persons whose tastes are aquatic. There is a flora which would be a source of never-ending interest to the botanist, for it is peculiar to this region ; and the same re mark applies, to some extent, to its ornithology and ento mology. There are ancient ruins in all directions to satisfy the most inveterate arch\u00e6ologist, Avhile the explorer has only"], [341, "JERICHO\u2014 A NEW WINTER RESORT. 327 to cross the Jordan, and in a few hours he will find himself in a region almost untrodden by the foot of the tourist, with all manner of interesting discoveries aAvaiting him. Then he is still comparatively in the world, for a smart ride of five hours will take him back to Jerusalem, and he need not be afraid of having to suffer hardship, for the fare in the Rus sian hospice is reported excellent, especially in the matter of milk and vegetables. My advice, then, to the invalid, the sportsman, the man of natural history, and the antiquarian, who may be looking out for a new Avinter resort, is, \" Go to Jericho !\" There is no particular reason that I can see why the Russians should have a monopoly of this charming spot, though we should be very much obliged to them for making it habitable. No doubt Avhen the partition of \"the sick man's\" property, for which they have been Avaiting so long, takes place, they will put in a claim for Jericho. Meantime I am glad to see that the government seem to be put upon their mettle. Not only have they built a hand some aqueduct across the ravine on Avhich the modern vil 1 ge stands, but they have cleared a large expanse of the plain on the other side with a vieAV of bringing it into cul tivation and irrigating it by means of the said aqueduct. This plain extends in an unbroken level to the Dead Sea, and affords a pleasant six-miles scamper. It is the grazing ground generally of large herds of camels, and on a hot and thirsty day they come in very opportunely. They are ever-ready if not ever-willing fountains, and there is nothing more refreshing than a drink of warm camels' milk. It is not easy to milk them, as they don't like strangers, and one is apt to get charged by a savage mother who mistakes one's intentions. Moreover, it requires some dexterity to milk a camel into a tumbler. In fact, this is difficult with any animal. I have had a battle with a nanny-goat on a bare Palestine hillside when I Avas thirsty, Avhich ended in my utter discomfiture. The only plan is to backshish the goatherd or camelherd. It is an odd sight to see a young camel tugging away at one side of its mother and the camel herd tugging away at the other, and the resigned old female chewing her cud between them; it suggested to me a design for a picture which I sent to an artist friend, to be called"], [342, "328 HAIFA. \" The Rivals.\" With the Dead Sea and the burning hills of Moab for a background, I think it would make rather an effective picture. HoweA-er often I might visit the Dead Sea, I would always bathe in it, in spite of its stickiness afterwards. The sensa tion of floating Avithout the slightest effort for an indefinite time Avhen one is hot and tired is infinitely soothing. The government intend building a bridge OArer the Jordan, and on my way back from visiting its proposed site I passed the much-disputed position of Gilgal, where the Israelites made their first camp in the Promised Land. This has but recently been identified by the ever-to-be-lamented Palestine explorer, Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, who fell a victim to his zeal in the Jordan valley. Nothing is to be seen there now but some mounds, in Avhich have been found pottery, broken glass, and tesser\u00e6. It was for long the resting-place of the Ark and the Tabernacle. It was someAvhere on this plain that Sodom and Gomorrah, \" the Cities of the Plain,\" were situated, and not to the south of the Dead Sea, as was formerly supposed, but their sites have been looked for in vain. The great events of which the plain of Jericho had in early times been the scene, together with its traditional con nection with the temptation of Christ on the Mount, which rises abruptly behind the Spring of Ain-es-Sultan, and actual interest Avith regard to his baptism in the Jordan and other events, attracted the Christians of a very early age to this part of the country. Hence from Justinian's time the plain began to be covered with monastic edifices, and the gorges and precipices of the enclosing mountains to be burrowed with hermit's caves and sacred shrines and chapels. There is a tendency, on the part especially of the Greek and Armenian churches, to reoccupy some of these. Certainly of all the uncomfortable and dreary and broiling monasteries I ever saw, that of Kusr Hajlah, near the Dead Sea, now in habited by half a dozen monks, claims pre-eminence. It is placed just on the edge of the saline plain, which exhales in summer a pungent heat that must render life almost insup portable. Nevertheless, it bears all the marks of having been an important medi\u00e6val monastery. The old walls still"], [343, "JERICHO\u2014 A NEW WINTER RESORT. 329 exist on three sides, and measure about forty yards by sixty. These contained tAvo chapels above ground and one beneath in the vaults. The walls are still covered Avith frescoes, the designs of Avhich are distinctly visible, as well as the inscrip tions in Greek beneath them. They are evidently of Crusad ing times. There is a large cistern here, thirty feet by ten and twenty-four deep, which is in good preservation. So is another at the monastery of El- Yahud, -thirty feet deep, Avith piers and arches also almost perfect. This monastery is dis tant about half an hour from the Jordan, and dates from the twelfth century. It stands on the site of one Avhich was called the Monastery of St. John on the Jordan, but which was destroyed by an earthquake. The interest attaching to these monasteries, however, is comparatively slight. Upon arch\u00e6ological grounds they exhibit no very striking features, Avhile from a religious point of view they are significant chiefly as showing how soon the religion of Christ became degraded into a system of useless asceticism, and, consider ing the tendency which is exhibited to return to it, the lam entable reflection is forced upon one that the true spirit of Christianity is as little understood noAV as it was in those days. The monks who inhabit these buildings are in one sense as interesting as the buildings themselves, for one has only to converse with them to be transported to the Middle Ages. They are probably the only class of men Avho have remained absolutely unaffected by nineteenth-century civilization or modes of thought. They are like the toads that have been locked up for centuries in stone, and might in so far as their religious views are concerned be the identical individuals Avho, in the time of the crusaders, used to inhabit the cells they now occupy. From a psychological point of vieAV, then, it is curious to converse with them on matters of faith and religion, for unless one has had personal experience of the degree of ignorance and superstition which are still to be found in a recluse of the Armenian Church, for instance, one could not credit the fact that such a being exists; and still represents a considerable class in the days in Avhich we live. The Arabs around Jericho are of a tribe called Abou"], [344, "HAIFA. 330 Nuseir. They venerate a place called \" The Place of Sepul chre of Dawar.\" This personage was their ancestor, and the Abou Nuseir bury their dead in the tombs of the Dawar people. Arabs of any other tribe passing this spot make use of the expression, \" Pel-mission, oh, Dawar,\" and the valley is sacred, and ploughs, grain, and other articles are deposited here for safety. The usual votive offerings \u2014 sticks, rags, bracelets \u2014 are found near the tombs. This tribe is scattered about in tents among the thorny bushes that cover the plain, amid which their flocks find good pasture. They are reputed to have a bad character, but we made great friends Avith them, OAving to a circumstance Avhich secured their gratitude. While sitting by the fountain one afternoon we saw a number of Arabs carrying a man on a litter. This excited our doctor's \"curiosity, and we immediately hailed the pro cession. They told us they had a wounded man, and we replied avc had a doctor, and they waited till we came up. In fact, an elderly man had just received a bullet in the leg from a friend with whom he had had a quarrel, Avhich splint ered the bone a little below the knee. The ball Avas still lodged in the leg. The doctor, who had made five military campaigns, and had probably dressed as many gunshot wounds as any man alive, was in his element. Instantly the man was taken to the nearest tents, splints of bamboo and band ages of flour and the white of an egg were speedily extem porized, Avhile a large audience of wild-looking men, women, children, and dogs crowded around to watch operations. The ball was probed for, not with any surgical instru ment, for we were unprepared for any such emergency, but Avith the finger. The only instruments forthcoming Avere a penknife and a razor. The question was how to get the ball out Avith such appliances. The occasion Avas one which called for a display of genius, but the demand Avasnot made in vain ; with that simplicity which is its most marked characteristic, the doctor cut into the opposite side of the leg with the razor, and then pushed the ball clean through with his finger. The astonishment of the audience was excessive at the appearance of the crushed bullet, and the wounded man, a weather-beaten old Semite, Avho had"], [345, "JERICHO\u2014 A NEW WINTER RESORT. 331 bellowed lustily while the operation Avas going on, kissed the doctor's hand effusively, and consoled himself with coffee and cigarettes, in which Ave joined, Avhile the band aging and splinting was in progress. For a couple of days after this the doctor visited his patient twice a day amid the Avarmest expressions of gratitude on the part of the tribe, Avho forthwith brought all their sick to be cured, and the blessings Avhich were invoked upon us echoed in our ears when we took our departure, till they died aAvay in the dis tance."], [346, "A SHORT CUT OVER AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY. Haifa, Oct. 1. \u2014 About half a mile in rear of our camp, at Ain-es-Sultan, rose a precipice a thousand feet high, which culminated in the lofty crest of a mountain called Quarantul. It derives its name from a tradition which identifies it Avith the mount upon AA-hich Christ was tempted for forty days in the Avilderness. Of course, it is not the mountain at all, or, at all events, there is not the smallest particle of evidence to prove that it is, but that is a trifle where sacred sites are concerned. The face of this precipitous cliff is honeycombed with the black mouths of caverns. Sitting round our camp fire at night wo observed lights gleaming from the sheer side of the rock. Otherwise there was nothing to lead us to sup pose that anyT of these caverns could be occupied by human beings. But these fires excited our curiosity, and we de termined to pay the cave-dwellers perched so high above our heads a visit. The operation turned out a more dizzy one than I had anticipated. No guide Avas necessary, for we could see the track winding like a thread up the face of the precipice. For the first three hundred feet or so it Avas all plain sailing, but then the ledge became horribly narrow. Occasionally the path was so steep that it dwindled into rock-cut steps. A false step would have sent you thundering hundreds of feet down into the abyss. At one place the height was so dizzy, the foothold so slight, that my nerve, which for this sort of Avork is not Avhat it once was, began to give way, and I ignominiously squatted doAvn, Avith my face turned to the rock, and tried to steady myself by forgetting that six inches behind me was a yawning chasm, from Avhich a pebble might have been dropped plumb to the bottom. Retreat was as bad as advance, and more humiliating.

I don't know anything more disagreeable than the irresistible im pulse which overtakes one sometimes to pitch one's self head long over a precipice of this kind. At last, to my inexpressible relief, I reached the mouth of a cave, into AA-hich I sprawled, panting, Avith thankfulness, but oppressed nevertheless Avith the horrible consciousness that I had the return voyage still to make. HoAvever, I dis missed this painful consideration for the moment, and ap plied myself to the examination of the curious grotto Avhich we had reached. It Avas a sort of ante-chamber to a tunnel in the rock, passing through Avhich we came upon some dreadful steps cut on the face of the rock; but here there Avas a slight, rickety balustrade of wood, and at the top stood a greasy old monk, a sight which, under the circumstances, produced a more soothing effect upon my mind than such a sight usually does. This ecclesiastical worthy received us with gracious smiles, and led us through another tunnel into a sort of A-estibule, which opened into a chapel Avhich had been constructed at the mouth of a cave, so that the front facing the precipice was of masonry. Looking out of the window which had been constructed in this wall, a stone might have been dropped at least five hnndred feet Avithout touching anything till it reached the bottom. This chapel was gor geously fitted up, thanks to the contributions of pilgrims whose heads must haA'e been steadier than mine was. It had a handsomely decorated screen covered with sacred designs richly gilt. The apse was six feet in diameter, and the total length from the inside of the apse to the back of the cave about twenty -five feet, the breadth being about twenty. A door led out of this chapel into a narrow pas sage and up two or three steps into another cave, or niche, Avhere there Avas a figure of a saint. As far as I could understand from the monk, Avho spoke Greek, and A-ery bad Italian, somewhere here was the spot where Christ stood A\\-hen he Avas tempted. The walls of the chapel were covered with frescoes. The large, cavernous vestibule was the dwelling-place of the monk, with Avhom was associated a younger sort of acolyte, who lived in a cave overhead, which Avas reached by a flight of stone-cut steps"], [348, "HAIFA 334 from the back of the vestibule. There Avas also a small inner cave, fitted with a door, in which they kept their stores. The old man told me he had lived here like an eagle in an eyrie for ten years Avithout even descending to the plain beloAV. I wondered how he kept his health with out taking exercise. All hermits who live on the sides of precipices should, I think, have treadAvheels of some kind fitted up for them, or rotating cages like those in which Italian white mice take their exercise. I don't think our old friend, however, led a very ascetic life, so far as eating and drinking are concerned. He insisted on our staying to drink some excellent coffee, after Avhich he produced a bot tle of very good mastic, or spirit made from corn and flavored with anise-seed. I observed some fresh green salad and cauliflower on his side-table, which the Arabs bring him from their gardens at the foot of the hill. He had also an abundant supply of good Arab bread. His water is sup plied from a cistern, of which there are several attached to the caves. He told me that eight of these were at present inhabited, but most of them Avere higher up. He Avas the spiritual superior of them all, and although there was an other chapel in ruins, his was the only one in Avhich service was performed. He invited me to continue my explorations to the caves higher up, but my mind was so much occupied with thinking how I was to get down as to exclude from it any idea of going higher up. Altogether this hermit was a jolly, hospitable old fellow, and it would be as cruel to pick him out of his hole and drop him into the busy world as it is to puck a periwinkle out of his shell Avith a pin. Partially shutting my eyes and presenting my rear to the enemy, I crawled backAvards down the giddy steps, and just at an uncomfortable corner came upon a jet-black man in a sort of priestly garb, who turned out to be an Abyssinian hermit. He has no connection Avith the establishment I had been visiting, having his own cell and his own church all to himself. His bosom was stuffed with manuscripts in Ethio pian characters. Under any other circumstances I would have endeavored to converse with so rare a specimen of ecclesiastical humanity ; but how can a man engage in a theological discussion in an unknown tongue, hanging be-"], [349, "A SHORT CUT OVER AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY. 335 tween earth and heaven on six inches of slippery rock? I felt rather inclined to say vade retro Satanas \u2014 not an inap propriate remark, considering the mountain I was on; and yet the poor man meant Avell, and, indeed, gave me an arm. He does not stick to his perch, however, like the old raven I had been visiting above, but usually resides in Jerusalem, visiting his cave during the forty days of Lent and at other stated periods. We noAV determined to bid adieu to Jericho and the Mount of the Temptation and to strike across country into Samaria. This would take us over an unbeaten track and show us a country very imperfectly known. We trusted to finding our way by asking it, or by picking up local guides Avhen we were utterly at a loss. By this means, although one runs a considerable risk of being benighted, or of having to scram- ble over almost impracticable mountain paths, you get a bet- ter chance of stumbling upon objects of interest than by fol- loAving a more trodden route. For more than two miles we skirted in a northeasterly direction the base of the lofty cliffs of the Jebel Quarantul. On our right a copious steam, which has its rise in a fountain called Ain Duk, irrigated an exten- sive tract of land, Avhich Avas green and Avell cultivated. If there had only been population enough to develop it proper- ly it would be a most productive region. There were all the evidences that in ancient times its resources Avere not thus neglected. Everywhere the remains of stone Avatercourses and aqueducts were visible, one bridge in particular having no fewer than three tiers of arches one above another. The construction Avas ingenious and peculiar. At the bottom or narrowest part of the ravine which it spanned was one huge pointed arch. Immediately over this Avere four pointed arches, while at the side of them was a fifth, double the height of the others, the foundations of which were in the steep side of the ravine. Above these again were six more pointed arches Avhich supported the aqueduct. Thus there were altogether tAvelve arches, and of these only two were the same size. The old Roman masonry of which they were composed was still in a very good state of preservation. Near this aqueduct were also the substantial remains of an old Roman road."], [350, "HAIFA 336 We now crossed, for about three miles, a fine undulating country covered with rich herbage, upon which large herds of cattle were feeding, and folloAved most of the Avay an ancient cemented channel, about four feet wide, Avhich had formerly conveyed the Avaters of another stream to swell those Avhich had their origin at Ain Duk, and all of Avhich were carried over the aforementioned high level bridge, The stream which Ave were now approaching was also surrounded by cultivated and irrigated land. The Avhole of this plain in its richness and wealth of water far surpassed anything my expectations had led me to anticipate. Near the base of the mountains from which this fine stream issues are the re mains of an ancient fortress situated on a high mound or tell, called Khurbet el Aujeh. The stream bears the same name. This is the sixth large stream which I have counted gushing from these mountains in a distance of about eight miles. My compass now told me that I must get up into the mountains if I intended to strike the Jerusalem and Sa maria road at the point Avhich I proposed. From informa tion Avhich I had taken before starting I expected to find the track in question ascending the valley from which the Aujeh issues, but we looked in vain for signs of any such track. Indeed, on forcing our Avay up it a little distance, we found that its precipitous sides closed in on us in a manner which effectually barred all further progress. We were wonder ing Avhat to do in our dilemma, Avhen, fortunately, we ob served some peasants making some irrigating channels, and from them, after much chaffering, Ave obtained a guide. It is a singular thing that these poor peasantry, whose day's labor in the fields cannot be worth more than ten cents to them, will refuse fifty rather than leave what they are about and act as guides. On this occasion it was with great diffi culty that I bribed a man with a dollar. To our surprise he took us straight to the base of an apparently impracticable cliff and proceeded to climb up it. As my experience of Palestine horses has convinced me that they can go almost wherever a man can, provided you leave them to find their OAvn way, we proceeded to breast the limestone crags Avithout misgiving, the only hardship being that the day was hot and Ave had to climb them on foot. To scramble up a"], [351, "A SHORT CUT OVER AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY. 337 thousand feet on a stretch by a path which was generally quite invisible is no slight operation, and one which, in this instance, it would have been impossible to perform without a guide, such impassable barriers did the rocks seem to pre sent until the guide showed us the way to circumvent them. When Ave did reach what Ave fondly hoped Avas the summit, it was only to find a barren, undulating Avilderness stretch ing before us, every now and then involving more climb ing, for the elevation at which we were destined to arrive before the end of our day's journey AA-as more than four thousand feet higher than the level from Avhich Ave started. If the scenery by which we now found ourselves sur rounded Avas rugged, it Avas wild and grand in the extreme. Gloomy and precipitous gorges intersect these mountains in every direction. Not a sign of a habitation is visible any where, and AA-ith the exception of a single goatherd we did not meet a human being for hours. The vegetation Avas also \\-ery sparse, relieved, however, by great quantities of the fragrant AA'hite broom in flower, and cyclamen and scarlet anemones. Even in the days of the ancients it must have been a barren, uncultivated tract, but I Avas repaid for the scramble across it by one or two evidences of extreme an tiquity of the greatest interest. The first of these consisted of four huge prostrate slabs of stone. They were evident ly the blocks Avhich had once formed a dolmen that had been overturned. Now, the interest of this lies in the fact that no dolmen, or signs of a dolmen, has ever yet been discov ered in Judea, though eagerly searched for. There is only one doubtful one in Galilee, but they are abundant to the east of the Jordan. The reason assigned for this is that the tribes to the east of the Jordan did not obey the command, when they entered the land of Canaan, to \" overturn the ta bles of stone,\" to destroy- the Canaanitish altars, and to break or smash their pillars; while the tribes to the Avest, especial ly Judah and Benjamin, were very particular in this regard. Here, I think, is the only evidence which has yet been found in Judea of this interesting fact. This region was apparently one much dedicated to Baal worship. I saw many stone circles and one or tAvo alignments of large stones, but the most curious Avas an enclosure about twenty- 22"], [352, "HAIFA 338 four yards square, formed of rough, unheAvn stones, each weighing a ton or more, piled to a height of two or three upon each other. In the centre was a circle, eight feet in diameter, of large stones, with a single stone in the middle of it. This was a monument which evidently existed from pre- Judaic times; but, although I attempted hurriedly to take its bearings, I am afraid that in that wilderness of stone I should never be able to find it again. We were pretty well worn out when we reached at last the village of Mugheir, the first inhabited place we had seen since leaving our camp near Jericho, and where we proposed to call a halt for the refreshment of man and beast. Mean time, as our tents and baggage had been sent by another road, Ave began to feel extremely doubtful as to when we should ever see them again."], [353, "EXPLORATIONS IN PALESTINE. Haifa, Oct. 7. \u2014 The village of Mugheir, where we halted to rest after our long and weary scramble from the Jordan valley, is one of the most out-of-the-Avay places to be found in Palestine. It is not on the Avay anywhere, but a sort of Ultima Thide \u2014 the last spot where ground fit for cultiva tion is to be found. It stands on the margin of a charming little plain, Avhere there is a fine olive grove. Indeed, look ing AvestAvard, the prospect is cheery enough, but eastward it is wild rock, black, gloomy gorges, or less precipitous but equally barren A^alleys. The sheik received us Avith great cordiality, albeit quite unused to the visits of travellers, and spread before us such fare as he could, flat Arab bread, roasted eggs, curdled goat's milk, and figs, butter, and hon ey. I mention the last three together because you eat them together. You first dip your dried fig into the butter, you then dip it into the honey7, and then put it into your mouth. I never tried the combination before, but it is not bad. He also gave us a hot compound of flour and sugar boiled to gether, which he seemed to think a great deal of, but, be yond being sweet and sticky, it had no especial merit. His Avife Avas the fairest Avoman I ever saw for a pure-blooded fellahah peasant. In fact, she could not have been fairer had she heen a blue-eyed, light-haired Sw7ede or German. After satisfying my hunger I Avent to look for antiqui ties, and found several rock-cut tombs and cisterns, a fine rock-heAvn wine-press, and four towers all in a good state of preservation, and three of them inhabited. They measured thirty feet square and as many in height. The basement stones were massive enough to be the masonry of a former period, but exactly of what date I am unable to say, possi bly not earlier than the crusades; though I found some foundations of walls which I am inclined to ascribe to a"], [354, "HAIFA, 340 much older date. There has been probably a town or village here from time immemorial, though I am unable to identify it with any Biblical site. The sheik insisted upon accompanying us himself as guide to a place called Singil, which we had fixed upon as our night quarters. Our way led us through a small, de pressed plain. After passing some remains of no special in terest we reached a A'ery remarkable ruin, called El-Habs. It is a tOAver on a rocky scarp, with Avails built partly of masonry, partly of rock, which measure about sixty feet by thirty. The stones of which these walls are composed are of immense size, measuring from tAvelve feet up to eighteen feet in length, with a height of from three to four feet each. The masonry is thus quite equal to the average size of the temple stones in Jerusalem. The tOAver has two entrances. Near it are the remains of another large building of about one hundred feet square outside measurement, and with Avails six feet thick. Its interior is divided into four paral lel chambers, running east and west, of various breadth. One of the partition Avails has archways through it, with piers between. All round these buildings are the founda tions of ancient walls and houses and bell-mouthed cisterns. The whole place bears the marks of extreme antiquity. It has been examined by the officers of the Palestine Survey, but is not mentioned in any guide-book, and I am unable to form any conjecture in regard to it. Our road now lay through a fertile plain, called The MeadoAv of the Feast, possibly in some connection with the yearly feast which used to be held by the Jews in old times at Shiloh, from which historical site we were not far dis tant. It is a comfort noAV and then to come upon a Biblical site about the identity of which there is not the slightest doubt, and such is the case with Seilun, the modern name for Shiloh. It stands in an extremely retired valley, and on our way to it we put up the third batch of gazelles we had started in one day. This was the spot where the Taber nacle was first permanently set up in Canaan, and where the Israelites assembled to allot the Promised Land. They were probably encamped hard by on The Meadow of the Feast, across Avhich we had just been riding, and it was probably"], [355, "EXPLORATIONS IN PALESTINE. 341 on this meadow, Avhile the maidens Avere dancing at the fes tival in honour of the ark, that the remnant of the Benja mites concealed themselves among the vineyards on the hill sides and carried off two hundred maidens. At present it is impossible to be certain whether any of the remains now visible existed at the time when the Tabernacle Avas there. The ruins Avhich first strike the eye on the hillside are evi dently those of a comparatively modern village, Avith here and there fragments of masonry which may date back to Crusading times. Then there is a Ioav, square building sup ported by two roAvs of columns, Avhich has been used as a mosque, but in early times may have been a Christian church ; but the most remarkable monument is a square building of which only the Avails remain. It is apparently of three ar chitectural periods, and it is just possible that the oldest may have been Jewish. The original walls have been added to by a sloping scarp having been built against them, so that the wall, Avhich is about fourteen feet high, is nine feet thick at the bottom, and about three feet thick at the top. In side are some fragments of columns, capitals, and a door lintel, which has recently fallen from the principal entrance, on Avhich are carved tAvo Avreaths, flanked by tAvo double handled pitchers, and in the centre an amphora. There are no inhabitants at Shiloh now, so we pushed on to Singil, a village situated about three thousand feet above the sea -level, and commanding a most magnificent view. The villagers here showed me some foundations of what they said had been an old castle built by a certain King Sin bil, but I strongly suspect that they substituted the b for a g, as the village takes its name from a certain Crusading hero, who was afterwards canonized and became St. Gilles, and that here he built himself a castle. The natives also sent me into a cave on a wild goose chase after an inscrip tion, Avhich, after much scrambling with lighted tapers, I failed to find. We had now left Judea, and were entering ancient Sa maria, which is governed, not from Jerusalem, but Damas cus, the seat of government being Nablous, a large town of about twenty thousand inhabitants, whose princijjal indus try is the manufacture of soap, with which they supply al-"], [356, "342 HAIFA most the whole country. The town is squeezed in between the lofty hills of Ebal and Gerizim, both of which are over three thousand feet above the sea-level. This is the valley of Shechem. Nothing can exceed in picturesqueness the situation of this place and the beauty of its surroundings, especially when the almond and peach trees are in bloom in the valley. The steep hillsides seem to be a mass of huge cactuses; these are used to line the terraces of the vineyards as hedges, but as they are great absorbers of vitality from the soil, I should think they must impoverish the land. In the autumn these ungainly plants are thickly covered with fruit about the size of a large fig, when ripe of a bright red. They are full of small seeds, but sweet and refreshing. The natives gorge themselves upon them, as they are esteemed Avholesome, but they are traps to the unwary and inexpe rienced of the most painful kind, being covered outside with diminutive and almost invisible prickly hairs. The first time I ever tried to eat one I filled my mouth with these unpleas ant little spikes, and spent half an hour with my tongue out, while a friend \\A-as engaged with a pair of tweezers extract ing each individual irritant, but then he only partially suc ceeded, and for the rest of the day I felt as if I had tried to swallow half a chopped-up hair-brush. The natives pick the fruit by digging a pronged iron into them, Avith which they twitch them off the stalk; they then roll them on the ground, so as to get the hairy prickles off, and then care fully peel them. The great green leaves have spikes like pins half an inch long upon them, which inflict a most vi cious and poisonous prick. I once tumbled into a cactus bush, and really suffered severely for many hours. Under these circumstances it is something amazing to see camels munching these leaves, prickles and all, with apparent relish; a donkey eating thistles is a joke to it. Nablous is also surrounded by extensive olive groves, and the oil is celebrated throughout Palestine; it also exports cotton of native growth. In fact, for a Moslem city, it may be considered an enterprising and go-ahead place. At pres ent it lacks the prime necessity of a carriage road to the sea coast. All its exports and imports have to be conveyed on the backs of camels. If the long-projected railway from"], [357, "EXPLORATIONS IN PALESTINE. 343 Haifa to Damascus could ever be consummated, a wagon road could easily be constructed in connection with it, and Haifa would then become the port of Nablous, instead of Jaffa, which is slightly nearer to it. With the exception of the long central street, Avhich forms the principal bazaar, the streets as a rule are more gloomy and tunnel-like than most Oriental towns, though there are many handsome stone houses, and the building of new ones afforded evidence of the growing wealth of the inhabitants. The consequence is an improvement in the reputation of the population, Avho have in former times been notorious for their turbulent fa naticism, but of late years the Turkish government has suc ceeded in establishing its authority on a firmer foundation and making its exercise felt. Indeed, the superficial travel ler in the Turkish empire, Avho only sees the defects of the existing system of administration, is hardly a fair judge of the progress that has been made in a certain direction un less he is able to compare it with Avhat has been. There can be no doubt that during the last twenty years a great change has been worked in the establishment of law and order and in the security of life and property. If op pression has the disadvantage of grinding the people and making their lives miserable, it, at all events, has the merit of intimidating them and restraining them from acts of vio lence and crime. If the unjust judge and extortionate tax gatherer are taking the heart out of the people, they are taking the pluck out of them, too, and one result is that the stranger can now travel in safety through regions Avhere he Avas once sure of being plundered and possibly murdered, and walk unmolested through Moslem crowds, where for merly he might have been subjected to insult. Nor is this due to the direct action of any foreign power or to the ex ercise of any diplomatic pressure in favor of reform. On the contrary, the influence of foreign poAvers Avas never so low as it is at present, and I am convinced that all attempts on the part of foreign poAvers to enforce reforms on Turkey only hinder them. The influence of the sultan and his gov ernment is not to be maintained throughout Islam by any action in obedience to the dictates of Christian powers. They resent it, just as the South used to resent the inter-"], [358, "344 HAIFA ference of the North in the matter of slavery; but this does not prevent their being alive to any advantages which ac crue to the empire by enforcing, as far as may be, a respect for law and order; and, so far as it is possible, to develop its resources without being beholden to foreign capital, or increasing the power and influence of the native Christian population. The difficulty is that the instinct of the Mos lem is not in favor of progress, and that he is always out stripped in the race by his Christian neighbour. Again, the country can only be developed through the education and enlightenment of the people; but Avhere an administrative system is in itself corrupt and unenlightened, the education and illumination of the masses means their endowment Avith the faculty of perceiving abuses, and pos sibly Avith a determination to resist them; and this danger is so great that it must be averted, even at the cost of the national prosperity. For this reason the government sets its face against the education of Moslems in Christian schools, not because they are afraid of the Moslems being converted to Christianity \u2014 there is not the slightest danger of that \u2014 but because they are afraid of their imbibing West ern ideas of social and political life, which are opposed to the conditions which characterize the existing administra tion of affairs. In fact they are not opposed to reform, but it must be a reform not suggested from without, nor im posed upon them from within; it must neither be in obedi ence to diplomatic pressure nor to popular clamour; it must be a reform of their OAvn initiative, and as any such reform, to be effectual, must begin by the authorities with whom it is to originate reforming themselves, the process seems al most hopeless. Still, as I have already remarked, there has distinctly been change, and change for the better, so far as security for life and property and the extension and en forcement of official authority are concerned, during the last twenty years \u2014 security of property to the people, be it understood, from their own mutual plundering propensities. Whether this security extends to the demands of the tax gatherer, and how far it has conduced to their own material Avelfare and happiness, is quite another question."], [359, "SACRED SAMARITAN RECORDS. Haifa, Oct. 15. \u2014 The chief interest connected Avith Na blous lies in the fact that it is the residence of the remnant of those Samaritans who were colonized here by Shalma neser, King of Assyria, Avhen he carried away the children of Israel captive. From the Biblical record (2 Kings xvii.), it would ajipear that the neAV settlers were drawn from mixed nationalities and various cities Avithin his domin ions. Some came from Babylon itself, some from Hamath, a town betAveen Damascus and Aleppo, and others from Cuthah \u2014 probably the Kutha of Arabian geographers, a town and district betAveen the Tigris and Euphrates\u2014 some from Ava, which has been identified with the modern Hit, and some from Sepharvaim, once the famous city of Sip para, both cities on the Euphrates, in lowrer Mesopotamia. We are also told that the neAV colonists petitioned the King of Assyria to be taught the religion of the JeAvs, and that he sent them a Jewish priest to teach it to them, and that they added it on, after a curious fashion, to the various forms of idolatry which they had imported from their dif ferent localities, and hence established a mongrel sort of worship, which became afterwards purified, but Avhich never theless rendered them especially obnoxious to the Jews of Judea, all the more so because they intermarried with the remnant of the tribes of Israel which had escaped the cap tivity, thus forming a race as mongrel as their religion. It is about twenty -six hundred years since this event took place, but the ancient worship of the Samaritans exists to this day; so also does the bitter antagonism which they and the Jcavs entertain for each other. This is the oldest national feud, probably, in existence, but is as fresh as if it only originated yesterday. Like the Jews, the Samaritans have managed to survive all the vicissitudes"], [360, "HAIFA 346 of fate, but with the difference that a small remnant has clung through them all to the locality in which they were originally established, though they have dAvindled in numbers to one hundred and sixty souls. As an ethnological fraction of antiquity they are, perhaps, the most interesting group of people extant. The first one I ever made acquaintance with Avas a young man who called upon me in a mysterious manner one day in Haifa. He handed me a document in Arabic, in which, after stating that for certain reasons, which he implied were by no means discreditable to him (he was an outcast from his OAvn people), he implored charity, and requested me \"to cast upon him a regard of compassion and benevolence.\" The document further said: \"All that I have inherited from my parents and ancestors is a manuscript written in ancient Hebrew, nine hundred years old, containing two chapters of the Rible, including the commandments, which I beg to offer you, in the hope that you will recompense me in return by a sum which will relieve my distress. \" He signed himself \" Shellabi, the son of Jacob, the Samar itan.\" Noav, I knew that Jacob es Shellabi was once the spiritual head of the sect, for he had been in London under the title of \"The Prince of the Samaritans,\" and the ro mance which attended his style and dignity had, it was re ported, even captivated a fair Englishwoman, who Avas will ing to become a Samaritan for his sake. Fortunately for her \" the Prince \" was already married, a fact which I be lieve he only divulged on his return to his native land. Anyhow, here was the son of a prince in distress, and here was an extremely ancient and curious manuscript for sale. The youth looked such a scamp, however, that he did not enlist my sympathies. I suspected that he had lost his money by gambling, Avhich proved afterwards to be the case; so when he said he considered the manuscript worth ten dollars I offered him one dollar, on which he retired indig nantly. A few days later, howcA'er, he reappeared, took his dollar thankfully', and I retain possession of the manuscript. It is on coarse parchment of a yelloAvish-brown color, two feet six long, and fifteen inches Avide. It was evidently originally longer, but has been torn off. One edge has been subjected to the action of fire. The writing is in transverse"], [361, "SACRED SAMARITAN RECORDS. 347 columns, each column thirteen inches long by five wide, and containing from sixty to seventy lines. The characters are of the old Samaritan type, small, rude, and irregular, differ ing in many important respects from the ancient Hebrew, and illegible to a good modern Hebrew scholar to whom I have shown it. I have no doubt, however, that it could be deciphered by an expert in such matters, who Avould also be able to establish from the formation of the characters its antiquity.* This incident excited my interest in the Samaritan ques tion, and when I was at Nablous I visited the synagogue, examined the ancient Thorah, or book of the law, and have since looked into the subject generally. The ancient syna gogue was appropriated by the Moslems some centuries ago. The modern building is a small, unpretentious, oblong struc ture. The walls are rough and Avhitewashed, and the roof is vaulted Avith two little domes in the centre. The mizbah, or altar, is about five feet square, covered Avith a veil of yelloAV silk. Within are receptacles for the sacred books. Of these the most valuable are never shoAvn to strangers. One or two persons have, however, seen the most ancient, which the Samaritans claim to have been written by Abishua, the son of Phinehas, thirty-five hundred years ago. It is only seen by the congregation once a year, when elevated above the priest's head on the Day of Atonement. The Thorah Avas rolled round a cylinder of wood similar to those used in ordinary JeAvish synagogues, and I was gratified to observe that it exactly resembled the fragment in my possession. It was evidently very ancient. The priest Avho shoAved me the synagogue Avas a remarkably handsome, dignified-looking man about forty years old. I asked him whether he Avas the chief priest. He said he Avas, and that Jacob Shellabi no longer had any position among them. I then said I had obtained a piece of manuscript from his son, to which he made no reply, but at once turned the subject. I suspect the youth was a mauvais sujet, Avho committed an act of sacrilegious theft before leaving the paternal mansion, and who did not, therefore, deserve more than he got. * This MS. has since been examined, and is pronounced to be part of the rentatcuch in Samaritan characters of the fifteenth century."], [362, "348 HAIFA. Noav, Avith regard to the sacred books Avhich I did not see: They are in some respects in the highest degree interesting, as throwing light upon the Biblical record. In the first place, from what is known of the most ancient version, claiming to be by Abishua, Gesenius and other great schol ars have given it as their opinion that if it could be col lated, it would be found in many cases to preserve the sense, which has been lost in the Jewish version. This opinion is founded upon the results of such collation as has been pos sible Avith Samaritan texts Avhich have fallen into the hands of scholars. Besides the most ancient roll there are three other books known to be in the possession of the Samaritans.* These are the Samaritan book of Joshua, the Samaritan Chronicle, and the so-called \" Fire-tried Manuscript.\" The Samaritan book of Joshua probably dates from the thirteenth century. It was published at Leyden about forty years ago from an Arabic manuscript in Samaritan character, and is thought to have been compiled from an early Samaritan and three later Arabic chronicles. It is invested Avith a peculiar interest from the fact that it helps to supply a remarkable lacuna in the Biblical record, which does not appear to haA-e received the attention it deserves from Biblical students. It is, in fact, evident that a large portion of the present book of Joshua is missing. That book purports to be an account of the conquest of Canaan and its allotment among the twelve tribes. Under these circumstances it is most remarkable that Ave hav-e no account of the conquest of Samaria, though the campaigns in the south, including the siege and taking of seven cities, and the invasion of Galilee, and the defeat of the league of six kings of Northern Palestine, are fully de scribed. Then we have no list of royal Samaritan cities, though all of them in the other parts of the country are carefully enumerated. We haA-e no description of the bound aries of the two tribes to which Samaria was allotted, nor any list of the cities awarded to them. Some of the Levitical towns mentioned in Chronicles as belonging to Samaria are not to be found in Joshua. It will be found also that, taken * I am indebted to the researches of the Palestine Exploration Fund for these details."], [363, "SACRED SAMARITAN RECORDS. 349 as a Avhole, there are only about forty Samaritan places noted out of some four or five hundred places in Western Palestine. The Jewish hatred of the Samaritans rose in the early Christian period to so great a pitch that the Mishnic doc tors avoided even mentioning the name of Samaria. Thus, in the Talmud only some half-dozen Samaritan towns are noticed. In describing Palestine the Mishna divides it into Judea, Galilee, and Per\u00e6a, leaving out all mention of Samaria. It is just possible that long before this an omis sion may have been purposely made by the early transcribers of the Biblical book of Joshua in regard to Samaria. At all events, the meagre record Avhich it contains is richly supple mented by the Samaritan book of Joshua, Avhich brings down the history of Israel from the date of the conquest to the time of Samuel, Avhose predecessor, Eli, was, from a Samari tan point of vieAV, the earliest schismatic, and the founder of a new and heretical temple at Shiloh in opposition to that built by Joshua on Mount Gerizim. The divine glory rested upon Gerizim for two hundred and sixty y*-ears, or during the reign of nine successors of Joshua, the schism betAveen the children of Judah and the orthodox, as the Samaritans call themselves, dating from the time of Sin, after the death of Samson. The book opens much in accordance Avith the Biblical nar rative, but no less than four chapters are deA-oted to the his tory of Balaam and his death, being an enlargement of one Biblical verse. The conquest of Shechem by Joshua con tains an account of the miraculous discomfiture of the enemy, and of a letter sent by him announcing it to Eleazar, the priest, fastened to the Avings of a doA-e. It contains also the account of a new league against the children of Israel under a king called Saubac, in conjunction with the kings of five other tOAvns, Avhich can all noAV be identified. A thrilling narrative of the battle Avhich takes place between Joshua and these kings at El-Lejjun, on the ancient Megiddo (Ar mageddon), is also given. With this episode the history of the war ends. The chief value of the book lies, however, in the light it throws upon the ancient geography of Samaria. Out of a total of thirty-one places mentioned in it, thirteen"], [364, "HAIFA. 350 are Avithin the confines of Samaria, and most of these are not to be found in the Bible. The Samaritan chronicle goes back to the beginning and gives the astronomical reckoning from Adam. Some of its topographical details are of much Aralue. Thus it contains a list of tAventy-two towns Avhere the high -priest who suc ceeded Tobiah resided, all being apparently in Samaria as far as they can be identified. It is known that in the second and third centuries the Samaritans Avere in a very flourish ing condition, and had colonies in Egypt, and even a syna gogue in Rome. The chronicle gives their possessions in Palestine as allotted by the High -Priest Baha the Great, about one hundred and sixty years after the destruction of Jerusalem. This description is interesting, as it seems to in clude all Palestine, with the exception of Judea proper, to the mountains of which the Jews are confined. At a later period the chronicle gives a list of those tOAvns which were inhabited by the Samaritans after the Hegira. This is a period Avhen very little is known of this nation. The places mentioned extend nearly over the whole of Pal estine outside of Judea, and colonies are also mentioned in Damascus, Cairo, and Baalbek. There is a ruin about five miles from Haifa called Kefr Samir, or the town of the Samaritans, which I occasionally visit to grub for inscrip tions, Avhich Avas one of their colonies. Those at Gerar and Gaza lasted till the present century, but none are to be found now outside of Nablous. It is only to be expected that the chronicle should centre all the holy places of the Samaritans at Shechem or Nablous. The fifth article of the Samaritan creed was the assertion that Gerizim Avas the chosen abode of God upon earth. Here Adam and Seth raised altars; here Melchisedec, ser vant of the Most High God, was met by Abraham \u2014 for Geri zim the Samaritans hold to the present day is the highest mountain in the world, the only one not covered by the flood. Here Abraham offered up Isaac, the very spot being shoAvu on the eastern brow of the mountain ; and, indeed, as Dean Stanley has argued, it is as likely to be here as at Jerusalem, as Josephus and the Talmudists affirm. Gerizim was also the site of Jacob's vision, and, finally, it was on 4"], [365, "SACRED SAMARITAN RECORDS. 351 Gerizim, and not on Ebal, just opposite, as stated in the Bible, that, according to the Samaritans, Joshua erected, first an altar, afterwards the tabernacle, and lastly a temple. The fourth and last of the known ancient sacred books of the Samaritans is the fire-tried manuscript. It consists of two hundred and seventeen leaves, containing the law from the twenty-ninth verse of the first chapter of Genesis to the blessing of Moses in Deuteronomy. It is much worn; the letters are not so small as those of Abishua's roll, nor as large as those of the later roll. The hand is steady and uniform, and the character of the letters indicates that it is of very ancient date. A note at the end of the book of Numbers connects the manuscript Avith a story in the Sama ritan book of Joshua. It runs: \" It came out from the fire by the power of the Lord to the hand of the King of Eabel in the presence of Zerubbabel the Jew, and was not burned. Thanks be to the Lord for the law of Moses.\""], [366, "THE TEN LOST TRIBES. Haifa, Oct. 25. \u2014 In my last letter I gave some account of the ancient literature of the Samaritans, which is still extant and in their possession. The people themselves, how ever, are such an interesting ethnological fragment of a re mote past that there are many points connected Avith their origin and history Avhich are worthy of consideration, the more especially as they bear upon a problem which has, of late years, exercised a singular species of fascination over a certain class of minds. I refer to the so-called \" lost \" ten tribes. It may be a disappointment to the Anglo-Israelites to suggest that they are more likely to be found in the neighbourhood of the country they were carried from than in England ; but, under the circumstances, it is certainly a more rational and less strained hypothesis, as I think may be clearly shown by a reference to existing traditions, facts, and records. It would appear from the recently discovered cuneiform tablets which are now under the investigation of Assyrian scholars, that, while they substantially afford a remarkable confirmation of Biblical history, there are certain discrepan cies in regard to the capture of Samaria and the carrying away of the Israelites into captivity, which make it some what difficult to determine the exact date and nature of that event. The complete recovery of the records of Shalma neser (IV.), who no doubt did besiege Samaria, -will clear this up, and throAV light upon the records of his successor, Sargon, Avho seems to have succeeded to the throne about the time of the capture of the city, after a three years' siege, and who in that case would be the monarch who actually carried off the Israelites. If this were so, then, according to the date of his accession, the captivity must have occurred before the invitation which Hezekiah sent out through the"], [367, "THE TEN LOST TRIBES, 353 country of Ephraim and Manasseh inviting Israelites to the Passover at Jerusalem, where we are informed that large numbers attended it (2 Chron. xxx. 18) ; and it would put beyond a doubt, what is in fact most probable, that Sargon, in carrying away the Israelites captive, did exactly what Nebuchadnezzar also did not long afterwards, when he car ried off the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and left a large population of the poorer classes behind, who were not Avorth taking. Indeed, when one comes to consider the population which we know to have inhabited Samaria and Galilee at this time, it seems incredible that any conqueror Avould haA-e burdened himself Avith a host Avhich must have numbered at the low est estimate over a million souls and probably a great many more ; and this conjecture is borne out by the fact that we read, in Jeremiah xli. 5, that a deputation of fourscore Israel ites came to Jerusalem after its destruction, or more than a hundred years after the captivity of the Israelites. That the Israelites thus left intermarried with the colonists sent from Assyria on the adoption by these latter of the Jewish religion, under the instruction of a priest sent for the pur pose, is extremely probable. The Samaritans themseh-es, however, deny all intermixture Avith the colonists, and main tain they are pure-blooded Israelites ; and in confirmation of this Ave may mention their marked Jewish type of counte nance, their possession of an ancient text of the books of Moses, and their observance of the Jew-ish Passover accord ing to the most ancient forms of that rite. The Samaritan account of their origin and composition is, as may be supposed, diametrically opposed to that contained in the books of Ezra and Nebemiah. They assert that at the time Avhen the tAvo tribes returned from the captivity a large number of the ten tribes also returned to Samaria under Sanballat, called by Nehemiah a Horonite, but the Samaritans call him a Levite. The Samaritan account goes on to state that while the tAvo tribes under Zerubbabel re paired to Jerusalem, the rest of the congregation, three hun dred thousand in all, besides youth, Avomen, children, and strangers, were led to Gerizim, where they established the Temple. Then came the quarrels between the Jews at Jeru- 23"], [368, "HAIFA 354 salem and the Israelites at Samaria about the building of the Temple ; and the accounts contained in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and the Samaritan records are not very discordant. Making allowance always for the fact that the Biblical books do not admit that the Samaritans were Israel ites at all, though they admit that Sanballat's son was mar ried to the daughter of Eliashib, the Jewish high -priest, while this latter is stated to have allied himself with Tobiah, Avho was a Samaritan priest. This caused great displeasure to Nehemiah, and increased the schism, but it goes, too, far to confirm the supposition that Sanballat and Tobiah were Israelites. The Samaritans are, indeed, in the peculiarities of their doctrine, almost identical Avith the original Jewish party \u2014 the Karaite and Sadducean sects. They are even called Sad ducees in Jewish writings, and their denial of the resurrec tion Avas, like that of the Sadducees, based on the declaration that nothing Avas to be found in the law of Moses on the subject. Again, their version of the law is closely similar to that of the Septuagint, which was a translation authorized by a Sadducean high-priest from a text differing from that finally established by the Pharisees. It is often Supposed that the Samaritans borrowed their doctrine from the Sad ducees, but it seems more rational to admit that they were a sect originally identical, because originally Israelite. The animosity of Josephus, who was a Pharisee; the fierce denun ciation of the Talmud, written by Pharisees ; the destruction of the Gerizim temple by Hyrcanus, also a Pharisee \u2014 all combine to indicate that the Jew-ish hatred had nothing to do with any foreign origin of the race, but was rather roused by the religious differences of a people whom they kne.AV to be their own kith and kin. If we adopt this theory the fate of the ten tribes is no longer a mystery. As we know that before the captivity they Avere addicted to strange gods and strange marriages, it is not improbable that a large proportion lost their tribal identity Avhile in captivity by intermarrying with the people by whom they were surrounded, and became merged with them. It is also probable that a certain number, according to the Samaritan chronicle three hundred thousand (but it"], [369, "THE TEN LOST TRIBES. 355 need not be so large a number), returned from their captiv ity at the time when the two tribes received permission from Cyrus to return. It is also likely that others who still re tained their religion did not return, and are the ancestors of certain Hebrew nomads still wandering in the desert. The Jews from Yemen, for instance, assert that they are of the tribe of Dan, Avhile there are Jewish shepherds in Mesopo tamia Avhose ancestry seems not distinctly traceable to the two tribes. The fact that those aa-1io returned to Palestine have dwin dled numerically to so small a number is no reason why they should not have been at one time a considerable nation, as indeed we know they were from their subsequent history. They made serious revolts against the Romans in the time of Pilate, and again during the reigns of Vespasian and Se verus, but under Hadrian they assisted the Romans against the Pharisees. In the sixth century they attacked the Chris tians and put the Bishop> of Nablous (or, as it was then called, Neapolis) to death, being at that time spread over Egypt and the Avhole of Palestine, except the hills of Judea. Cling ing to the unity of God, they hold Moses to be the one mes senger of God, and Gerizim to be the earth's centre, as it is the shrine of their faith. In this they are supported by the fact that while blessings and curses are invoked on the two Samaritan mountains in the books of Moses, there is no men tion in those books of Jerusalem. They also believe in a state of future retribution, and of angels and devils as ministers of God in the unseen AA-orld. They look for a Messiah who is to be of the sons of Joseph, and they hold that he is now on earth, though not yet de clared. His name is to begin with the letter M. His titles are Tahcb, \"the restorer,\" and El-Mahdi, \"the guide.\" Un der his direction the congregation Avill repair to Gerizim. Under the famous twelve stones they will find the ten com mandments, and under the stone of Bethel the golden ves sels of the Temple and the manna. After one hundred and ten years the Prophet, Avho is considered inferior to Moses, is to die, and be buried beside Joseph, whose tomb they shoAV in the \\-alley. Soon after, on the conclusion of seven thou sand years from its creation, the world is to come to an end."], [370, "HAIFA. 356 The Samaritans keep the Feast of the Passover on Geri zim, near the ruins of the ancient temple ; here they pitch their tents, and at sunset they slay sheep aud bake them for several hours in a huge oven in the ground, Avhich is lined with stone. The men are girded with ropes, with staves in their hands and shoes on their feet, as though prepared for a journey. They generally eat standing or walking. After the women have eaten, the scraps are burned and a bonfire kindled and fed with the fat. The rest of the night is spent in prayer, and the following day in rejoicing. Besides this, the Feast of Tabernacles is also held on the mountain, where they construct arbors of arbutus branches. The Feasts of Pentecost and of Purim and the Day of Atonement are also observed. The mountain is very barren, rising abruptly to a height of one thousand feet above the valley in which the town is situated. The ruins which are to be found upon it are de scribed in the guide-books, so I shall only allude to Avhat is new in regard to them. Considerable excavation Avas car ried out here by Captain Anderson under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and plans made of what remains of the Fortress of Justinian, which is one of the most valuable monuments of Byzantine art in Palestine, and of the church said to have been built by Zeno. The twelve stones, traditionally said to have come from the Jordan, Avere also excavated, and found to be large, unheAvn masses of rock placed upon two other courses of stone rudely dressed and not squared. Some paved platforms were also laid bare. These, together with the twelve stones, may possibly have formed part of the temple built by Sanballat on Gerizim. Curiously enough, there is a sacred rock here, with a cave under it, not very unlike the rock and cave over Avhich the Mosque of Omar is built in the Haram at Jerusalem, and Avith the same traditions attached to them. There is also a large ruin on Mount Ebal, enclosing an area ninety-two feet square, with walls twenty feet thick; but the excavations Avhich were made here were attended Avith no result, and conjecture is at fault as to what it may have been. Perhaps the most interesting spots at Nablous are Jacob's well and Joseph's tomb, but this from the point of view"], [371, "THE TEN LOST TRIBES. 357 purely of association. Where sites which can be identified with any certainty are so rare, these two spots stand out pre eminently as places about which there is a unanimity of agreement and force of tradition Avhich go far to confirm their authenticity. They are venerated by the members of every religious community in Palestine. Here also Ave may look with almost positive certainty upon the position taken up by the Israelites when they stood \" half over against Geri zim \" and \" half over against Ebal,\" to listen to the reading of the law. Great pains have also been taken to discover the position of \" the great stone \" which Joshua \" set up under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord \" when he made his covenant with the people in Shechem imme diately before his death, and not altogether without success. The exactitude Avith which the tombs of Joshua, Eleazar, and Phinehas are described in the sacred record enables us to regard the ancient sepulchres which are still pointed out as theirs with far less skepticism than usually accompanies our notice of such memorials of the dead. Altogether, the extreme antiquity of Shechem as a site, and the important events of which it was the scene in the earliest period of Jewish history*-, invest it with an interest denied to every other locality in Palestine, excepting Jeru salem itself, while the well of Jacob must eArer be memo rable \u2014 if, as was most likely, it was the spot where Christ met the woman of Samaria \u2014 for perhaps the most remarkable of all his utterances. When we remember the religious fanaticism which characterized both Jew and Samaritan, and the bigoted prejudice which envenomed the inveterate hatred they felt for each other, and which turned principally upon the rival claims for sanctity of Jerusalem and Gerizim, it seems almost incredible that a Jew could have been found, and he a carpenter, gifted with such lofty courage and such high spiritual intuition that he should dare to say: \" Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither on this mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the Father. They that worship him must Avorship him in spirit and in truth.\""], [372, "RESEARCHES IN SAMARIA. Haifa, Nov. 3. \u2014 While at Nablous I received information that a large piece of ancient sculpture had been discovered by a man in excavating some foundations. I procured a guide, and proceeded to his dwelling. It was evidently the residence of a man of means, and stood in a large courtyard, at the entrance to Avhich I knocked for admittance. After hammering for some time a voice from within asked who I was and what I wanted. On my shouting a reply, I was abruptly told to go aAvay, and all was silent. Now, the ac counts I had heard of this antiquity stimulated my curiosity to such a degree that, in addition to the indignation I felt at this treatment, my desire to see the relic overcame my forbearance, and, seizing a stone, Avhile I ordered my attend ant to take another, Ave made the quarter ring with our blows. After a time the voice was heard again : \" Why don't you go away. I Avon't open the door.\" \" I Avon't go aAvay, and I will break open the door if you don't open it,\" I shouted. \" But I am the chief of the police.\" \" I don't care who you are ; open the door,\" and bang Avent a stone against it. There Avas silence for a moment, and then another and a milder voice: \"Wait a moment. I will let you in,\" and the door opened and revealed an empty courtyard and a youth. \" My father was angry because you disturbed him so early,\" he remarked, apologetically, and I then observed many signs betokening a recent rapid evacuation on the part of the female members of the family. Now that I Avas in,Avith a large fragment of a beautifully carved frieze staring me in the face, I could afford to be civil. I Avas profuse in my apologies, and promised to dis-"], [373, "RESEARCHES IN SAMARIA. 359 turb no one if I were only shown the antiquities. But I was destined to experience another reaction of disappointment when the mild youth informed me that this was all there was left. The others had been sent to the museum at Con stantinople. Fortunately antiquities, especially when they are massive, travel slowly in this country, and as I had an opportunity of seeing these before they left Haifa, and made such careful copies of them as time permitted, I will describe them. The peculiar interest Avhich attaches to these remains, which evidently belong to the Gr\u00e6co-Roman period, arises from the fact that they may possibly have formed part of the great pagan temple Avhich is represented on the Greek imperial coins of the ancient Acropolis. The main objec tion to this theory is that the temple, it is supposed, Avas erected on Mount Gerizim, and the coins show that it Avas approached by a handsome flight of steps, whereas these re mains Avere found not far from the base of the mountain, though sufficiently on its slope to Avarrant the approach of a flight of steps. The fact that the subjects of the tableaux are all taken from Greek mythology Avould indicate that there must have been a large population in Samaria in those days, Avho, so far as their worship Avas concerned, were not Samaritans. Besides two draped figures, unfortunately without their heads, one life-size and one fifty inches in height, there Avas a pedestal forty inches high, triangular in shape, and on each face Avere tAvo tableaux in bas - relief, making six carved representations in all, in a very perfect state of preservation, with inscriptions in Greek above them, of Avhich, however, I have only been able to make out the general tenor in some cases. Besides copying the inscriptions, I made such sketch es as I Avas able of the tableaux. Where many figures are crowded together this is a \\-ery difficult operation. The first scene represents a chariot drawn by serpents, in which is a robed female, while on the left a woman is crouched doAvn under a tree. The second consists of Artemis, Apollo, and Leto, Avith their names inscribed above them, while on the right is the serpent Python, his head pierced by an ar row. The third represented an infant struggling with a"], [374, "360 HAIFA. serpent between two draped female figures, evidently Her cules strangling the serpents sent against him by Hera; for above were the Avords, \" Trophoi Erakles.\" These formed the upper tableaux. Below them were three other tableaux, illustrating the legend of Theseus, the inscription being \" Theseus gnorismata,\" above a tableau in which he is rep resented raising a stone under which are hidden the sword and shoes of his father Aigeus. In the second he is kneel ing on one knee in a struggle with the Minotaur, while be hind him are a group of boys whom he came to save. In the third he has slain the robber, Avho is lying prostrate at his feet. Theseus is nude and leaning on his club, with three other persons all robed standing by him. There can be little doubt that had any one been present when this discovery was made, a fuller excavation would haATe been amply repaid, and that the house of the ill-tem pered old Moslem stands on a site of the highest interest. I have carefully noted its position, in the hope that at some future day conditions may exist which would render possi ble an examination of his garden, Avhich is noAV surrounded by a high wall. It would require little digging to deter mine whether this was the site of the celebrated temple or not. I now left Nablous for the purpose of visiting the ruins of the ancient city of Samaria, distant about five miles, and formerly the political capital of the country. It is placed in a most commanding position, and, from a strategical point of vieAV, was well chosen. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the prospect of the surrounding country which is obtained from it. We first inspect the Crusading church of St. John the Baptist, which must have been a beautiful edi fice in its day. The walls alone are now standing. In an underground crypt, now held sacred by the Moslem peas antry, the saint is supposed to have been beheaded. The tradition, though erroneous, is ancient, and existed in 380 a.d. It has some colour, from the fact that the wilderness in which John preached is near this, and not near Jericho, as is generally supposed. It can be pretty well identified by the description \" Onon, near to Salem,\" where John was baptizing, \"because there was much water there.\" Both"], [375, "RESEARCHES IN SAMARIA. 361 these places retain their names, and there is an abundant supply of water, Avhich flows hence into the Jordan. The fact that Bethabara must be placed much higher up the Jor dan valley than the position usually assigned to it by tradi tion makes it pretty certain that the Wady Far'ah, the head of which is near Samaria, in which are Onon and Salem, and which Aoavs into the Jordan not far from the probable position of Bethabara, was the scene of John's ministra tions. The most interesting ruins, hoAvever, are those of Herod's Colonnade, to the Avest of the modern village. It seems to have run round the hill on a flat terrace, in the middle of which rises a rounded knoll, on Avhich the temple dedicated to Augustus, and stated by Josephus to be in the middle of the tOAvn, presumably stood. The remains are most perfect on the south, Avhere some eighty columns are standing. These are mainly monolithic. The width of the cloister was sixty feet, and the pillars are sixteen feet high and six feet apart. The whole length of what must have been a most imposing colonnade Avas about tAvo thousand yards, or nearly a mile and a quarter. Josephus makes it nearly two miles, but this is exaggerated. There is another street of columns at the bottom of the hill running in a line oblique to the sides of the upper colonnade. The colonnade was entered by a gateway, flanked by small toAvers, the scarps of which still remain. Samaria is not to be compared in antiquity Avith Shechem, its most flourishing time being, probably, during the reign of Herod, when, in fact, all Palestine enjoyed a period of architectural magnificence greater than anything it had pre yiously known. If, instead of folloAving the ordinary road from Samaria, we ascend, from the large village of Burka, a steep hill, we burst upon a view which is well worth the climb, which has also the advantage of being a short cut. We look down into a fertile basin covered Avith olive groves and villages, and in the distance can see a considerable ex tent of coast line near C\u00e6sarea, while the familiar outline of Carmel to the northwest closes the prospect. Then we plunge doAvn into the gardens of the village of Fendakumi yeh, Avhere there is a sacred cave Avorth visiting, contain-"], [376, "362 HAIFA ing two recesses, before AA'hich there is a detached block of stone like an altar. It may probably have been an ancient rock-cut chapel. Close to this village is another called Zeba, which I was sorely tempted to visit, as I had received an in vitation to do so from the sheik who lives here, and who is one of the richest and most powerful sheiks in the country. He had already called upon me in Haifa, and represents the great family of Jerrar, who once exercised an almost inde pendent rule in this district, setting the Turkish govern ment at defiance, and levying blackmail on the inhabitants, while they were in perpetual feud with rival families who claimed a like local supremacy in other parts of the country. The whole of this system was broken doAvn during the Egyptian occupation of the country by Ibrahim Pasha. When, by British intervention, it was handed back to the Turkish government, the latter succeeded in preventing its recurrence \u2014 not, hoAvever, without the application of force. More than one of these local sheiks can point out to you a hole in the wall of his house which Avas made by a Turkish cannon-ball. They are by degrees submitting to the influ ence of civilization, and, finding that it is no longer possible to compete successfully with the officials in plundering the peasantry, are making friends with these latter, so as either to go shares with them, or to obtain their favor and assist ance in their own agricultural operations, and thus avoid being robbed themselves. Thus in the immediate neighbourhood of this village there is a plain called the DroAvned Meadow, from the fact that during a great part of the year it is a marsh, and therefore unavailable for crops. Could it be drained it would add some thousands of acres of arable land to the village to Avhich it belonged. Not long ago I was consulted in regard to the possibility of its being drained, and an en gineer even went so far as to make an estimate of the prob able cost of the operation. Although the sum charged Avas very moderate, it was more than the capitalists could A'ent ure upon, but the very fact that they could entertain such an idea was a marked evidence of progress on the part of men whose only notion of drainage heretofore had been con fined to their neighbours' pockets."], [377, "RESEARCHES IN SAMARIA. 363 Although probably I should have seen a splendid speci men of a native magnate's establishment,! found that a halt at Zeba would have lost me a day, and I therefore pushed on Avithout allowing the sheik to suspect my proximity to his hospitable abode, still keeping to bypaths instead of following the beaten track to Jenin, the ancient Engannin, or Spring of Gardens. From thence, in a day's journey across the plain of Esdr\u00e6lon, I reached Haifa."], [378, "A DRUSE FATHER'S VENGEANCE. Daliet - el - Carsiel, Nov. 7. \u2014 An incident so highly characteristic of Druse life and manners has just occurred here that it seems Avorthy of narration. About three months ago I was invited to be present at the ceremony of the betrothal of the son of the richest man in the village, by name Sheik Saleh, with the daughter of a neighbour called Kara, whose wife was a sister of Sheik Saleh. The affair came off in the house of the former, a small mud-built cot tage situated in a court, with the usual arched roof, and floor of a rough kind of cement, on which were spread rugs and mats for the guests who crowded in to witness the ceremony. This took place at nine o'clock at night, and was performed by the khateeb, or spiritual sheik. It consisted in his join ing the hands of the future bridegroom and bride's father \u2014 the bride herself was not present \u2014 and in his repeating sev eral formulas in Arabic, among which I detected some of the verses of the Koran. A small sum of money was then paid over to the family of the bride, the khateeb took his fee out of it, refreshments were brought in, and the rite was over. It Avas a relatively tame performance, and not to be com pared with an actual wedding of another couple which took place shortly afterwards, when the festivities lasted three days and nights, during which time the bride, loaded with her doAvry, which consisted chiefly of silver coins formed into a head-dress and breastplate, danced incessantly in the centre of admiring circles of girls who danced round her, Avhile the men were also making the night resound with their discordant clamour to the utter destruction of slumber, firing off guns, making bonfires, and singing. In fact, at the end of the three days the whole village, but especially the bride, Avere utterly exhausted by their protracted gaieties. At"], [379, "A DRUSE FATHER'S VENGEANCE. 365 the end of this time she was put upon a horse and marched in solemn procession to the door of every house in the village, folloAved by a bevy of damsels screaming and clapping their hands. Each house was expected to contribute a small sum \u2014 make a wedding-present, in fact, to the neAvly-married couple. In this way she Avas finally conducted to the bride groom's house, where he Avas waiting for her Avith a capacious mantle, in which, on her arrival, he enveloped her, and then carried her into his house triumphant. To go back to the episode of the betrothal. It is the Druse custom for the father of the bridegroom to pay a sum of money to the bride's family \u2014 in other words, he buys his son a wife. Now, in this case, although I saw some money pass on the occasion, it was a mere formality. The father of the bride had, in a fit of generosity, probably interested, refused a sum of 2000 piastres, or about $75 for his daughter. He proposed instead that he should form a partnership for agricultural operations Avith Sheik Saleh, Avho, being rich, would be an advantageous partner. This Sheik Saleh agreed to, and the arrangement was completed, when it Avas objected to by Sheik Saleh's Avife, who, being a woman of character and resolution, induced her husband to break it off. This made Kara furious. He is a man of ungovernable temper, and he determined that his daughter should never Aved Sheik Saleh's son. But a betrothal of the kind I had Avitnessed is a very solemn ceremony, and the only person who can break it is the betrothed bridegroom. The girl and her family are powerless in the matter. Kara was so mad dened by what had occurred that, rather than let his daugh ter marry the son of the man by whom he felt himself to have been outraged, he determined to kill her. This was an odd resolution to arrive at. One would have thought he might have gratified his vengeance better by killing Sheik Saleh or his son. Druse passion, however, runs in curious channels, and he appears to have been exasperated because his daughter did not share in his fury against her cousin. So he led her out to slaughter, riding his horse and armed with his gun, and driving the poor girl, who was weeping and wailing bitterly, before him. Many of the villagers saw him, and were well aware of his intention, but shrank from"], [380, "HAIFA. 366 interfering. The place which he had selected for the exe cution was just at the bottom of the hill upon Avhich my house is situated, and the hour at which he was bent upon this bloody errand Avas eight in the evening. Now, it so happened that I have a Druse servant who has been with me for more than a year, a powerful man, a splendid sportsman, a most courageous felloAv, and, Avhat perhaps Avas of more importance, a near relation of Kara's. He chanced to be passing at the time, and knowing his relative's furious tem per, and perceiving that he really intended to murder his daughter, he interfered at the risk of his own life, and suc ceeded in rescuing the girl. Kara, however, was still too angry to be reasonable. He returned to his house foaming with passion, and finding his wife \u2014 who had lived with him for many years \u2014 weeping bitterly over the whole occurrence, he accused her of sympathy with her brother's family, and in the heat of the moment pronounced the fatal words Avhich, according to Druse custom, constitute a divorce. The trouble about a Druse divorce is, that the sentence which bids a woman return to her family, once pronounced by her husband, is irrevocable. Not only can he never take her back again as his wife, but he can never, in this life, so much as even speak to her again. If he sees her at the other end of the street he must turn aAvay to avoid meeting her. Nor may he enter a house in which he has reason to think that she is. A man may, therefore, in a moment of passion ruin his own happiness for life, and this is what Kara did. The whole occurrence only happened two days ago, and Kara has been in the deepest distress ever since. Had he killed his daughter, he said, it would not have mat tered. He would scarcely have missed her, and if she Avere to marry Sheik Saleh's son she would be dead to him any way; but to be deprived of a wife, against whom he had never had a complaint to make, who had loved him and served him faithfully all these years \u2014 this was a loss that nothing could replace. When I heard that he had spoken in this cold-blooded way about his daughter, and had alluded to the intention, which he admitted he had entertained, of killing her, without a shadow of compunction, I half regretted that he had not"], [381, "A DRUSE FATHER'S VENGEANCE. 367 been alloAved to die the other day of a leech which he had in his throat. He sent Avord that he was dying, and a medi cal friend who is staying Avith me went to see him, and found him in the last stages of exhaustion from a leech which had been sixteen days fastened too far down his throat to be liberated. These cases are not uncommon, and are due to the water of some of the springs in the neighbourhood. We have had five cases this year, but none so bad as Kara's, Avhich Avas the first. Salt and all the usual means Avere tried in vain, and, as the doctor Avas anxious to get some leeches to experiment -with, Kara's Avife and daughter, Avho both ex hibited the greatest distress, were despatched to a spring three miles off to get them. The alacrity they displayed in his service were ill requited by his subsequent conduct towards them. Here I may remark that large doses of tur pentine, taken internally, proved completely successful. There is little doubt that, had the leech not succumbed to this treatment, in two days more Kara must have succumbed to the leech. The daring Avith which Druses resort to acts of violence is to be accounted for by the fact that they can always escape justice. The moment a Druse commits a crime he flies to the Hauran, Avhich he can reach Avith hard travel in eight-and-forty hours. Here he takes refuge among his coreligionaries of the Jebel Druse Mountain, over whom the Turkish government exercises only a nominal authority, and where pursuit is impossible for any Ottoman official. Meantime there is to be a great gathering of the A'illage elders to consider whether it is possible to arrange the feud between Sheik Saleh and Kara. One of the uses to which Druse Khalwes, or places of worship, is put, is to discuss every question Avhich is of interest to the village. For in stance, should I desire to buy a tract of land from the vil lage held by many proprietors, they would hold a secret council in the Khahve to discuss the best method of cheat ing me. What passes at these meetings is considered abso lutely secret, and the minority are bound to accept the opinion of the majority, and afterwards to act with it. This imparts a Avonderful unanimity to all their proceedings Avith outsiders, though they quarrel very much among themselves,"], [382, "HAIFA 368 and these Khahve meetings sometimes lead to serious feuds and bloodshed. It seems likely to do so in this case, for it has been reported to me that Kara announced that if the decision of the meeting went against him, he would commit such an act as should prevent it \u2014 in other words, murder either his own daughter or her betrothed. I was considering hoAv I could best interfere to prevent such a catastrophe, when I received a few hours ago a visit from Kara himself. The purport of it, as usual, was to borrow money. I told him I could not possibly lend money to a man who first decided to kill his own daughter, and then for no cause divorced his Avife. He replied that when he had committed these acts he was possessed of the devil and unconscious of what he was doing. I told him that to lend money to a man who Avas subject to such demoniac possession Avas like lending money to the devil himself, and this I declined to do. He assured me that the devil had left him so completely that there was no fear of his getting hold of it. I said I required proof of this, and he could furnish me with it by assuring me of his readiness to allow his daughter to marry her betrothed. He said that was a matter in the hands of Allah. \" Then,\" I said, \" under these circumstances you are prepared, I presume, to accept the decision of the village as the decision of Allah.\" \" Yes,\" he replied, \" if they decide also that Sheik Saleh is to pay me fifty Turkish pounds for my daughter.\" \" I am sorry,\" I remarked, \" that Allah has just decided that I am not to lend you the money you want to borrow from me, and it will depend entirely upon the extent to which you allow the devil to influence you against the will of Allah how I treat you for the future.\" With that he took his departure; but I saw enough of his cowed temper for the present to hope that the matter may be arranged Avith a little judicious financial manage ment. It does not give an encouraging view of human nature to discover how potent a factor money is in its af fairs, even in a primitive Druse village. In many respects Kara is a superior man, decidedly bet ter than his enemy, Sheik Saleh, Avho will also have to be"], [383, "A DRUSE FATHER'S VENGEANCE. 369 dealt with, and Avho behaved badly in backing out of an arrangement which had already been concluded, for no valid reason. Owing, hoAvever, to the position which I oc cupy financially to the village, they are all more or less un der control, and I have it in my power to exercise a pressure which even the KhalwS Avould find it difficult to resist. Unfortunately, I shall be obliged to leaA-e instructions Avith regard to this delicate matter, as my stay in Palestine for the present is about to draw to a close, and with it must terminate this record of my experiences in a country which, in spite of its many draAA'backs, possesses in my eyes superior attractions as a residence to any other in Avhich my lot has been cast. a' 4 THE END."], [384, ""], [385, "VALUABLE WORKS OF EXPLORATION AND ADVENTURE IN THE EAST.
