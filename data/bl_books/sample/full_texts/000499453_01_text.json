It was in 1835 that Mr. Browning was introduced to Mac ready the tragedian, and it was out of this acquaintance that the production of \" Strafford \" came. Macready saw in \"Paracelsus \" the work of a true tragic poet, and suggested that Browning should write a play for him. Macready wrote in hisjournal in 1836: \"Browning said that I had bit himbj my performance of Othello, and I told him I hoped I should make the blood come. It would, indeed, be some recompense for the miseries, the humiliations, the heart-sickening dis gusts which I have endured in my profession if, by its exercise I had awakened a spirit of poetry whose influence would elevate, ennoble, and adorn our degraded drama. May it be ! \" A little later, Macready said to Mr. Browning, \" Write a play, Browning, and keep me from going to America ! \" Mr. Browning replied, \" Shall it be historical and English ? What do you say to a drama on Strafford ?\" In March, 1837, the play was put in rehearsal, and produced at Covent Garden Theatre on the 1st of May. To quote Mr. Edmund Gosse's account in \" The Century \" for Dec., 1881, from which I have taken the above details : \u2014 \" It is time now to deny a statement that has been re peated ad nauseam in every notice that professes to give an account of Mr. Browning's career. Whatever is said or not said, it is always remarked that his plays have ' failed '"], [8, "EDITOR'S PREFACE. IV on the stage. In point of fact, the three plays which he has brought out have all succeeded, and have owed it to fortuitous circumstances that their tenure on the boards has been comparatively short. ' Strafford ' was produced when the finances of Covent Garden Theatre were at their lowest ebb, and nothing was done to give dignity or splendour to the performance. 'Not a rag for the new tragedy,' said Mr. Osbaldiston. The King was taken by Mr. Dale, who was stone-deaf, and who acted so badly that, as one of the critics said, it was a pity that the pit did not rise as one man and push him off the stage. All sorts of alterations were made in the text ; where the poet spoke of ' grave grey eyes,' the manager corrected it in rehearsal to ' black eyes.' But at last Macready appeared, in the second scene of the second act, in more than his wonted majesty, crossing and recrossing the stage like one of Vandyke's courtly personages come to life again, and Miss Helen Faucit threw such tenderness and passion into the part of Lady Carlisle as surpassed all that she had previously displayed of histrionic power. Under these circumstances, and in spite of the dull acting of Vandenhoff, who played Pym without any care or interest, the play was well received on the first night, and on the second night was applauded with enthusiasm by a crowded house. There was every expectation that the tragedy would have no less favourable a ' run ' than ' Ion ' had en joyed, but after five nights, Vandenhoff suddenly with- drew, and though Elton volunteered to take his place, the financial condition of the theatre, in spite of the nn- diminished popularity of the piece, put an end to its representation.\" When the play was rehearsing, Mr. Browning gave Mac ready a lilt which he had composed for the children's song in Act V. His object was just to give the children a thing children would croon ; but the two little professed singers, Master and Miss Walker, preferred something that should exhibit their powers more effectually, and a regular song"], [9, "editor's preface.

The text of this edition has been revised by Mr. Browning. There are a good many changes in the punctuation, and a few verbal alterations. By a printer's error, unfortunately not discovered in time, a comma at the end of line 54, Act I., Scene 1, has been replaced by a period. I am privileged to print a letter in which Lady Martin most kindly complies with my request that she should write a few lines on the character of Lady Carlisle, which she so beautifully rendered when the play was first produced : \u2014 \" You ask me to write a few words about the character of Lucy Percy, Countess of Carlisle, as drawn by Mr. Browning in his play of ' Strafford.' That it is purely imaginary, he has told us himself in his preface. It is, therefore, not to be looked at in relation to any record of what the real Lady Carlisle was. It is drawn so firmly and clearly, that I feel it almost a wrong to my friend, Mr. Browning, to attempt to put my own idea of it into such words as one unaccustomed, like myself, to write on such things, can command. All I can say is, that I think Mr. Browning set himself a very difficult task in drawing a woman, full of love and devotion to a"], [10, "editor's preface. VI man who, while he could not help being grateful for such devotion to his interests, and attracted by her charms as a woman, yet was so engrossed by personal and public interests, and the conflict with political adversaries, that he gives little or no sign of a reciprocal affection. There was great danger in working out this idea, and placing Lady Carlisle at a disadvantage ; \u2014 for little sympathy is shown for a woman who shows her love, and meets only the coldest return. But over this difficulty the poet has, I think, triumphed. Among the other characters, of whom so many are selfish, headstrong, weak, or wayward, she seems to me to stand out in striking colours, such are the clearness of her perceptions, the fearlessness of her courage, the depth and nobleness of her love. \" I was a mere girl, and a novice on the stage, when the play was produced \u2014 but I remember well what struck me as the true note of Lady Carlisle's character, and how difficult I felt the task of trying to give it expression. But the soul of nobleness which shines throughout all her words and acts, helped me in a great measure through my anxious ordeal.\" The historical Lady Carlisle was the daughter of the ninth Earl of Northumberland. In 1639, she had been for three years a widow. Her husband was James, Lord Hay, created successively Viscount Doncaster and Earl of Carlisle. For a sketch of this strange woman, see Lodge's \" Portraits of Illustrious Personages,\" &c, vol. v., in Bohn's Library. Sir Tobie Matthews' \" character of the most excellent Lady, Lucy, Countess of Carlisle,\" prefixed to a collection of letters, which Donne edited in 1660, is of sufficient interest to repay a careful perusal. Lodge has an engraving of her portrait by Vandyke. There is a younger portrait of her along with her sister, Dorothy, Countess of Leicester, at Bilton, near Rugby, a relic of the days when Addison lived there. Waller's Saccharissa was her niece."], [11, "editor's preface. VII In annotating this play I have had before me the pro bable needs of students and the possible needs of teachers. Some time ago, when speaking of this play as a subject for study, a lady said to me, \" How can a modem work be studied ? What is there to say about it ? \" This remark must have originated in a feeling that etymology and verbal points in general are the things to be considered in teaching English literature, and that where there is little to do in the way of hunting up obsolete words there is little to do inany way. Itseemstome that \"Strafford,\" offering much to the mere reader, offers greatly more to the student, and that the hours spent over it will not be regretted. I have tried to give help, as far as possible, by suggestion, and have therefore frequently used the form of questions, instead of merely appending notes. It has appeared to me that the special beauty of certain passages should not be \" sign-posted,\" but that the poet should be left to speak for himself, as far as an annotated edition is concerned. I would suggest that the play should be read through, twice, if possible, before any use be made of the notes, and that the student should keep steadily in mind the necessity of considering the play as a whole. I shall take it as a kindness if any suggestions be sent to me, with a view to making a second edition, should the work be fortunate enough to reach one, more helpful than the first. I wish to express my very warm thanks to Mr. Brown ing for his readily given permission to issue this edition of \"Strafford\"; for his explanation of three or four passages \u2014 I being specially indebted to him for most of the note on v. 2, 40 ; and for his revision of the text. I have also to thank Dr. Abbott for some good hints, of which I have duly availed myself. I owe much grati tude to Professor Hales for his careful reading of my notes, and for numerous valuable suggestions, nearly all of which I have endeavoured to carry out."], [12, "editor's preface.

London, March, 1884."], [13, "INTRODUCTION. The reader of a play which is founded on the facts of history may reasonably wish to know how far the author has allowed himself to be bound by his knowledge of the actual course of events, and whether, if he has departed from it, it is possible to trace any principle in the variance. The present introduction is intended to give an answer to such a demand. When, at the age of twenty-five, Mr. Browning wrote \" Strafford,\" Mr. Forster's life of that statesman had just been published. There was an intimate friendship between the poet and the biographer, and Mr. Browning thus found the materials which he needed brought easily within his reach. In a passage which rises far above Mr. Forster's ordinary level, the true theory of the identity of Strafford's life is set forth. (\" British Statesmen,\" ii. 228) : \u2014 \" In one word, what it is desired to impress upon the reader, before the delineation of Wentworth in his after years, is this \u2014 that he was consistent to himself through out. I have always considered that much good wrath is thrown away upon what is usually called ' apostasy.' In the majority of cases if the circumstances are thoroughly examined it will be found that there has been ' no such thing.' The position on which the acute Roman thought fit to base his whole theory of \u00c6sthetics \u2014 \" ' Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere si velit, et varias inducere plumas, Undeque collatis membris, ut turpiter atram Desinat in piscem mulier formosa superne Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici ? ' &c,"], [14, "X introduction. \u2014 is of far wider application than to the exigencies of an art of poetry ; and those who carry their researches into the moral nature of mankind, cannot do better than im press upon their minds, at the outset, that in the regions they explore, they are to expect no monsters, no essentially discordant termination to any ' mulier formosa superne.' ****** \" Against all such conclusions I earnestly protest in the case of the remarkable personage whose ill-fated career we are now retracing. Let him be judged sternly, but in no unphilosophic spirit. In turning from the bright band of patriot brothers to the solitary Strafford \u2014 ' a star which dwelt apart,' we have to contemplate no extinguished splendour, razed and blotted from the book of life. Lustrous, indeed, as was the gathering of the lights in the political heaven of this great time, even that radiant cluster might have exulted in the accession of the ' comet beautiful and fierce,' which tarried awhile within its limits ere it ' dashed athwart with train of flame.' But it was governed by other laws than were owned by its golden associates, and \u2014 impelled by a contrary, yet no less irre sistible force, than that which restrained them within their eternal orbits \u2014 it left them, never to 'float into that azure heaven again.' \" Partly from want of sympathy with statesmen of Strafford's type, and partly from the lack of material which has since come to light, Mr. Forster did not succeed in constructing a biography which answered to the ex pectations raised in these sentences. He enabled us to see the zeal and energy of his hero, and he showed that the result was the establishment of a tyranny. To exhibit Strafford believing that he was establishing a reign of justice, and that he was even defending the English constitution against its assailants, was beyond his range. Is it too hazardous a conjecture to suppose that Mr. Browning was impelled to write \" Strafford,\" not merely"], [15, "introduction. XI by his admiration for the man, but also from some desire to give a portraiture of him which would have the com pleteness of an imaginative conception ? Whether it was so or not, there can be no doubt that the task which he undertook was one of extraordinary difficulty. The main interest of Strafford's career is political, and to write a political play Non di, non homines, non concessere column\u00e6. The interests of politics is mainly indirect. Strafford is impeached, not merely because he is hated, or because he has done evil things, but because he is expected to do more evil things, and because if he is not punished other people at some future time will not be easily deterred from doing other evil things. Such possibilities of future evil, which the historian is bound to consider, are, however, essentially undramatic. The poet can at most only avail himself of them as a background for the scenes in which the charac ters or the passions of his personages are developed. Still less can he bring upon the stage personages who discuss the bearing and meaning of Acts of Parliament, as Pym and Strafford did in real life. We may be sure, therefore, that it was not by accident that Mr. Browning in writing this play, decisively aban doned all attempt to be historically accurate. Only here and there does anything in the course of the drama take place as it could have taken place at the actual Court of Charles I. Not merely are there frequent minor inac curacies, but the very roots of the situation are untrue to fact. The real Strafford was far from opposing the war with the Scots at the time when the Short Parliament was summoned. Pym never had such a friendship for Strafford as he is represented as having, and to anyone who knows anything of the habits of Charles, the idea of Pym or his friends entering into colloquies with Strafford, and even bursting in unannounced into Charles's presence, is, from the historical point of view, simply ludicrous."], [16, "introduction. XII So completely does the drama proceed irrespectively of historical truth, that the critic may dispense with the thankless task of pointing out discrepancies, where the writer plainly meant that there should be discrepancies. He will be better employed in asking what ends those discrepancies were intended to serve, and whether the neglect of truth of fact has resulted in the higher truth of character. There is not much difficulty in answering the first question. From the beginning to the end of the play the personal relations between the actors are exaggerated at the expense of the political. To make that dramatic which would otherwise not be dramatic, Mr. Browning has been utterly regardless even of historical probability. Whatever personal feeling may have entwined itself in the political attachment between Strafford and Charles, is strengthened till it becomes the very basis of Strafford's life, and the keynote of his character. Having thus brought out the moral qualities of his hero, it remained for Mr. Browning to impress his readers with Strafford's intellectual greatness. The historian -who tries to do that will have much to say on his constitutional views and his Irish government, but a dramatist who tried to follow in such a path would only make himself ridiculous. Mr. Browning understood the force of the remark of the Greek philosopher that Homer makes us realize Helen's beauty most, by speaking of the impression which it made upon the old men who looked on her. Mr. Browning brings out Strafford's greatness by showing the impression which he made on Pym and Lady Carlisle. Mr. Browning took a hint from the old story which is without any satisfactory evidence, and which is indirectly contradicted by all the evidence which has reached us, that Pym and Strafford were once intimate friends. In carry ing on Pym's feeling of admiration for Charles's minister to the days of the Short, and even of the Long Parlia-"], [17, "introduction. XIII ment, the dramatist has filled his play with scenes which are more hopelessly impossible than anything else in it ; but they all conduce to his main object, the creation of the impression about Strafford which he wished to convey. He pursues the same object in dealing with Lady Carlisle. What he needs is her admiration of Strafford, not Strafford's admiration of her. He takes care to show that she was not, as vulgar rumour supposed, Strafford's mistress. The impression of Strafford's greatness is brought more com pletely home to the spectator or the reader, because of the effect which it produces upon one who has given her heart without return. Having thus noted the means employed in creating the impression desired, we have still to ask, how far the im pression is a correct one. On this point each reader must judge for himself. For myself, I can only say that, every time that I read the play, I feel more certain that Mr. Browning has seized the real Strafford, the man of critical brain, of rapid decision, and tender heart, who strove for the good of his nation without sympathy for the generation in which he lived. \u2022 Charles too, with his faults perhaps exaggerated, is nevertheless the real Charles. Of Lady Carlisle we know too little to speak with anything like certainty, but, in spite of Mr. Browning's statement that his character of her is purely imaginary, there is a wonder ful parallelism between the Lady Carlisle of the play and the less noble Lady Carlisle which history conjectures rather than describes. There is the same tendency to fix the heart upon the truly great man, and to labour for him without the requital of human affection, though in the play no part is played by that vanity which seems to have been the main motive with the real personage. On the other hand Pym is the most unsatisfactory, from a historical point of view, of the leading personages. It was perhaps necessary for dramatic purposes that he should appear to be larger-hearted than he was, but it imparts an"], [18, "INTRODUCTION. XIV unreality to his character. It must be remembered, how ever, that the aim of the dramatist was to place Strafford before the eyes of men, not to produce an exact representa tion of the statesmen of the Long Parliament. S. R. G."], [19, "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF STRAFFORD. I had for some time been engaged in a Poem of a very different nature, when induced to make the present attempt; and am not without apprehension that my eagerness to freshen a jaded mind by diverting it to the healthy natures of a grand epoch, may have operated unfavourably on the represented play, which is one of Action in Character, rather than Character in Action. To remedy this, in some degree, considerable curtailment will be necessary, and, in a few instances, the supplying details not required, I sup pose, by the mere reader. While a trifling success would much gratify, failure will not wholly discourage me from another effort : experience is to come ; and earnest en deavour may yet remove many disadvantages. The portraits are, I think, faithful ; and I am exceedingly fortunate in being able, in proof of this, to refer to the subtle and eloquent exposition of the characters of Eliot and Strafford, in the Lives of Eminent British Statesmen, now in the course of publication in Lardner's Cyclop\u00e6dia, by a writer : whom I am proud to call my friend ; and whose biographies of Hampden, Pym, and Vane, will, I am sure, fitly illustrate the present year \u2014 the Second Cen tenary of the Trial concerning Ship-Money.

Gracchus' death. Both the Gracchi, Tiberius and Caius (the \" jewels \" of Cornelia) were prominent as \" people's men,\" and both died the death of martyrs for the people's cause. Tiberius the elder, who seems to be the one alluded to here, was tribune of the people (see note to V. 277) in the year B.C. 133. Before he had offered himself for this office he had been deeply impressed with the sufferings of the poorer Roman citizens, which he traced to the unfair possession of public land by rich men. He brought in a bill to revive, with some modifications, a law that had been passed more than two hundred years previously, limiting the amount of public land to be held by any one citizen. The senators, who opposed Tiberius' election to the tribuneship for the second time, made an attack upon the people while the tribes were voting, and Tiberius was killed. Caius became tribune in 123 B.C., and carried out his brother's reforms with others still more sweeping. He fell in the year 121 B.C. See Beesly's Gracchi, Marius and Sulla. 213. Aceldama.

He first entered Parliament as a knight of the shire for Yorkshire. In 1628 he was made Lord Pre sident of the North. (What do we learn from this scene of the public situation ? of the cha racter of the men introduced ? Trace the line of thought by which Pym arrives at the conviction that Wentworth will once more take the people's side.) Notice the prominence of Pym in the thoughts and hopes of the people's men. Notice, too, how he does not seek to be prominent, \u2014 cares that England should be saved more than that he should be her saviour. See how Eliot \" being dead yet speaketh ! \" (What is the gist of this scene ?) Scene 2. 14. He 's surely not disposed, \u00a7e. Cf. IV., 75-8. 41. Nibble at what you do. Laud had said, \" I have of late heard some muttering about it in Court, but can meet with nothing to fasten on ; only it makes me doubt someone hath been nibbling about it.\" 80. The war\"! They cannot have agreed to that ? Cf. II. 2, 108-110. Wentworth had written from Ireland to Charles, \" If the war were with a foreign enemy, I should like well to have the first blow ; but being with your Majesty's own natural, howbeit rebellious subjects, it seems to me a tender point to draw blood first ; for till it come to that, all hope is not lost of reconciliation ; and I would not have them with the least colour impute it to your Majesty to have put all to extremity, till their own more than words enforce you to it.\" 88. Go now. Like the French allez done ! an ironical encouragement addressed by Strafford, in bitterness, to himself. 89. Forsake the people ! Cf. V. 2, 49, &c. We must keep before us the different standpoints of Pym and Strafford. Men having the same desires and hopes may go widely different ways to realize them. Strafford had used the expression, \" Salus populi suprema lex,'' when urging the prerogative of the Crown to levy forces. This \" salus populi\" was to be, \" in cases of extremity,\" the \" suprema lex,\" even above Acts of Parliament. 92. Spoke. Cf. Byron's\u2014 \" The idols are broke in the temple of Baal.\" In oome the -n of the strong passive participle has finally disappeared."], [101, "79 NOTES, 94. Henrietta Maria had disliked Wentworth most cordially. \" It ought to be stated, to Wentworth's honour, that though he much desired to have stood well with her Majesty, he declined to purchase her favour by acts inconsistent with his own public schemes. See curious evidences of this in Strafford Papers, vol. ii. pp. 221, 222, 257, 329, 425, 426, &c. .... The King himself appears to have made it a personal request of Wentworth, that he should can-}' himself with all duty and respect to her Majesty.\" \u2014 Forster's Strafford, note to p. 358. Browning was of course unaware of the evidence contained in the letters of Rossetti, of which no copies were in England when the play was written, but which show that about the time of the meeting of the Short Parliament she began to look to him as the saviour of her husband's cause. 96.

In prose English the relative when in the nominative case is never omitted. In poetry the aversion to lengthiness is manifested in avoiding the use of conjunctive words. See Abbott and Seeley's English Lessons for English Readers, 43. Browning's poetry is fuller of these ellipses than that of any other English poet. 147. o' God's love, o' here = of. Cf. Twelfth Night, V. 273\u2014 \" Of charity, what kin are you to me ?\" See also \"of all loves,\" Midsummer Night's Dream, II. 1, 154, and Othello, III. 1, 13, where, as Wright notes, the Folios read ': for love's sake\" and the Quartos \" of all loves.\" (In what sense is of used here ? Cf. \" of necessity \" and needs.) 159. Your letters were the movingest. Notice the declension of moving. 164-5, &c.

Afterwards the nominative replaced the dative, as clearly"], [102, "80 NOTES, seen in \"thou wert best\" (As You Like It, I. 1.) This latter usage cannot be preferred on logical grounds. 247. The apple of my sight. See Zech. ii. 8. 261. I will come, #c. In a letter dated Good Friday, 1640, written at Dublin just before Strafford crossed to England for the last time, he says, \" I shall cheerfully venture this crazed vessel of mine, and either, by God's help, wait upon your Majesty before the Parliament begin, or else deposit this infirm humanity of mine in the dust.\" 283. He talks it smoothly. Notice how the \" it\" points the half sneer which shows that the value of Strafford's advice is already diminishing in the King's eyes. Notice how, while to Lucy, Pym and his fellows are the Faction, to Wentworth they are Pym and the People. ( What appears to be Strafford's ruling motive ? What part does Lady Carlisle play here ? What do we see of the character of Charles ? of the Queen ?) Act II. \u2014 Scene 1. For the proceedings of the Short Parliament see Gardiner's History of England, vol. ix. 1. Twelve subsidies. A subsidy was originally a grant made by Par liament to the King \" upon need and necessity.\" In the time of Charles I. the usage of the word is ordinarily limited to a tax levied on lands and goods. The rate was 4s. in the pound on lands and 2s. 8d. on goods, though in consequence of the insufficient value put upon estates by the Commissioners appointed for the purpose, it did not in reality amount to anything like that sum. Each subsidy at this time produced about \u00a370,000. In its modern use the word means supplies granted by one nation to another, to assist it in the prosecution of a war. 3. Out of the serpent's root, Sec. Isa. xiv. 29. (What is the force of root here ?) Cf. Lat. stirps. 4. Cockatrice. A corruption of the Greek krokddeilos, lizard, through Latin and French.

Congratulate with me. Rejoice along with me, or as in older English it might have been, Rejoice together with me. 70. But we'll not have our Parliaments like those In Ireland. By Sir Edward Poyning's bill, a Parliament could not be summoned more than once a year in Ireland, nor could it be summoned even then unless the Bills to be proposed to it had been approved by the English Privy Council. 72. (Expand this metaphor. ) 90. No Bishops' war. (Why was the war with the Scots called the Bishops' war ?) (Describe exactly the part taken by Rudyard in this scene.

And compare with Pym's words in IV. iii. 69-81. Contrast the motives of the two speeches. In 1. 115, we have Strafford's first open expression of his thought of Charles. Notice \" So cold a heart.\" 130. See Strafford's extraordinary self-command. (Why does he exercise it ?) 137. Pym's grave grey eyes. Cf. \"You know Pym's eye,\" I. 1, 118. At this moment Pym has given up hope. 153. Keep tryst. See how the meeting between Pym and Strafford is dwelt on. Cf. 1. 165, 1. 276, III. 3, 97 ; V. 2, 301-304. We have Pym and Strafford as the two antagonists : before, Pym believed that Strafford might be England's saviour ; now, silently, he accepts the dread office of being the destroyer of England's foe. G"], [104, "82 NOTES 158. Fool to feign a doubt, \u00a7c. Pym means that it is but folly for him to doubt what the end must be ; but folly to affect the scrupulous and nice reserve which might belong to the man who knew himself ordained to achieve the feat of destroying England's enemy; and this because it is not he, Pym, but God Himself, who dooms Strafford. (Trace the meaning of nice from the derivation.) 167. Lady Carlisle has heard all. Notice Strafford's change of mood. It is perfectly true to nature : the fierce strain removed, the powers which had been braced up to the utmost state, and Strafford is poor and old and weary. 167. In \"those debonair romances\" all, indeed, goes well. Notice \" why, the King blesses him.\" Think how Strafford must have felt when he said this. \" Far from sure His squires are not the giant's friends.\" He is not sure whether those who seem to support him may not really be against him. But he will go on. It is all one, now. 167. Sorry. Poor. 184. The wind that saps, S;c. (Expand into a simile.) 187. A breed of silken creatures. Cf. Coriolanus, I. 9, 45 \u2014 \" Where steel grows soft as the parasite's silk.\" 188. Thrive In your contempt. While you despise them. For all that they thrive, and are powerful to do you harm. 190. Vane's slight sneer. Cf. II. 2, 57, &c. 193. I give that up. I give up caring about that. 210. Strafford's faith in the King has perished; but his purpose is unaltered, and he will go oil to the death. 225. My soul That lent from its own store, &c. What Lady Carlisle means is, perhaps, something like this : \" I expressed to Strafford the love I bore him myself as borne to him by Charles ; when he loved the King, he was loving a being such as I had represented Charles to be, not such as he really was.\" Observe how it had been through Lady Carlisle's representation of Charles that Strafford had grown so greatly to care for him. She had believed in him herself and drawn Strafford into a like belief. When she says, \" he shall behold my soul,\" the unexpressed hope is, \" if he sees the truth he may love me.\" 232. One image, cfc. The flaw in the diamond may take the shape of some sweet face, which nature means to create some day. But how ever beautiful this may be in itself, it is a flaw in the diamond, which ought to be absolutely clear. This image which you think to be Charles, this. \"sweet face\" which is not his \u2014 for you have never seen the King as he is, and this portrait in your soul is of some one who has never lived ; \u2014"], [105, "NOTES 83 this image is but a flaw in the diamond, your mind, turning blank its else imperial brilliance. Lady Carlisle does not yet understand; she thinks that if only Strafford could recognise that he had been mistaken in Charles, he would shake off the bond that bound him to the King. She does not see that Strafford knows the King, and loves him still. 243. Now she understands. He loves the King, not her; but she will serve him all the same, and none the worse for that brief hope that he might love her. 246. Observe her complete change of tone. She is now apparently the woman of the world. She will not let him know that she is suffering. \u2022 257. The George. The badge of the Order of the Garter, St. George mounted and piercing the dragon. 259. A masque. The masque was a dramatic entertainment, of Italian origin ; at first, it consisted of dumb-show and dancing only. The mechanical arrangements of it were often elaborate and costly. After wards, speeches formed part of the performance, and the highest of rank used to play in the masque. Ben Jonson wrote many masques for the Court, Inigo Jones planning the machinery, and Henry Lawes often writing the music for them. Sir Dudley Carleton describes a Court masque thus : \" At night, we had the Queen's maske, in the banqueting house, or rather the pageant. There was a great engine at the lower end of the room, which had motion, and in it were the images of sea horses and other terrible fishes, which were ridden by Moors. The indecorum was, that there was all fish and no water. At the further end was a great shell, in form of a shallop, wherein were four seats, on which sat the Queen and her ladies. Their apparel was rich, and too light and courtezan-like for such great ones. Instead of vizards, their faces and arms were painted black, which was disguise sufficient, for they were hard to be known ; but it became them nothing so well as their red and white.\" \u2014 Winwood's Memorials, ii. 44. Quoted in Popular Encyclop\u00e6dia. The most celebrated of masques is Milton's Comus (not a Court-masque). Shakespere has introduced a masque into the Tempest. On foot. Being arranged. 276. Why, then, I have a foe, SsC. Cf. Lady of the Lake, canto iv. \u2014 \" And that stern joy which warriors feel In foemen worthy of their steel.\" 279. Want = lack. Cf. Tempest, III. 179. \" that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.\""], [106, "84 NOTES, And As You Like It, III. 2, 20 :\u2014 \" He that wants money, means and content, is without three good friends.\" 280. Am I not here? Not in the market-place, S;c. I am now working for the King, not for the people. 286. Only one name, i.e. Charles's. 291. Until you love, S(C. You love the man and not the representative of the people, the recipient of love in their right. I do not love Charles as the King, but as the man whose mild voice and mournful eyes send me forth. For this allusion to Charles's personal appearance, cf. the impression produced by Vandyke's portrait. 294. One star for guide. This love for Charles. The words are an echo of Lady Carlisle's, 1. 266; but the thought seems to be widely different. (What does Lady Carlisle seem to mean ?) Act III. \u2014 Scene 1. 6. Next Lord's-day morning. Observe the sneer in Lord's-day. 12. The new Parliament. The Long Parliament, which met on the 3rd November, 1640. 40. Eliot's old method. When Charles ordered the adjournment of the House in 1629, it was under Eliot's leading that it asserted its right of self-adjournment. The Speaker, on moving to leave the chair, was forcibly held in it. Eliot plainly told him the order of the House would be sufficient to excuse him with the King. On some members then rising to leave the house, the doors were locked. 41. The Great Duke. Buckingham. Note that we are to understand that these Lords have planned the \" betrayal\" of Strafford. The Queen sides with the Lords. The com mon danger is \u2014 Pym. Scene 2. 5. We summoned so reluctantly, $-c. Charles had avoided summoning a Parliament until it was impossible to help it. He had tried the expe dient of summoning a Council of Peers at York, but the voice of the people made itself heard, and writs were at last issued. The issue of the war with Scotland had, as it has been phrased, \" dragged Charles to the people's feet.\" 28. Theobalds. The manor of Theobalds in Hertfordshire belonged"], [107, "NOTES, 85 to Sir William Cecil, better known as Lord Burghley. The house which he built there was originally small, but Elizabeth paying him a visit in 1564, he enlarged the house and made fine gardens. After this, the Queen paid frequent visits to Theobalds. His son, Bobert Cecil, ex changed Theobalds with James I. for Hatfield. James died at Theobalds, and it was at the court-gate that Charles was proclaimed \" rightful and dubitable heir,\" and it was from Theobalds that he set out for the North, in March, 1642, and raised the standard at Nottingham. During the Commonwealth the palace was demolished, and the money arising from the sale of materials divided among the army. At the Kestoration, the site, park, and manor were granted to the Duke of Albemarle (General Monk). For further information see a lecture by John Charles Earle, B.A. Oxon., on \" The Palace of Theobalds in the Olden Time.\" (Hotten, 1869). 28, 29. He must Dissolve the House. Charles had dissolved the House that had impeached Buckingham. Compare his conduct then with his conduct now, and the position of Strafford with that of Buckingham. Waller says, in the poem entitled \" Of his Majesty's receiving the News of the Duke of Buckingham's Death :\" \u2014 \" The Sacred Wrestler, till a Blessing given, Quits not his hold, but halting conquers Heav'n. Nor was the Stream of thy Devotions stop'd When from the Body such a Limb was lop'd As to thy present State was no less Maim ; Tho' thy wise Choice has since repair'd the same.\" 43. Windebank. One of the Secretaries of State. 45. Go find. A very common construction in older English. In our older literature editors have frequently inserted a comma between the imperative and the gerundial infinitive, thus making the constrnction apparently = two imperatives. In parts of England, and in Ireland, the expressions, \" Go find,\" \" Go see,\" &c, may still be heard. The English verb originally took -an, or -ian, as its infinitive suffix. The preposition to was never used except when the infinitive, used actively or passively, marked purpose, fitness, &c, and was in the dative case. When the endings -an and -anne had become weakened into -e, the to commonly preceded the ordinary infinitive as well as the other. We sometimes find the two prepositions, for and to, preceding the gerundial, and even the simple infinitive : this is found as early as the twelfth century. See Oliphant's Old and Middle English, p. 149. Before the ordinary infinitive, to is now merely an arbitrary sign, with no prepositional"], [108, "86 NOTES force. (What English verbs omit it ?) Thus, \"I desire to see\" = \" ic wilnige ge-sedn ;\" but, \" I am here to see (or be seen) \" = \" ic eom her to ge-sednne.\" 48. 'Tis to the Lords they go, Sec. Pym went up to the Lords at the head of upwards of 300 representatives of the English people to impeach Strafford. 50. Adage. Saying, saw. Lat. adagium, from ad, to, and a word connected with aio, I say. 55. Surely he will not come. Strafford had asked for the King's per mission to go to Ireland, knowing how dangerous it would be to come to London. 70. This in question. This being under consideration. 103. Say it were, $x: See note to 164, &c. 130, &c. She knows my purpose, Sec. Lady Carlisle thinks Strafford's \" purpose \" is \" to baffle Pym \" (1. 122, 8a!.). When he says, \" The whole of the scheme,\" he means, \" What is my scheme ? Do you really know it ? \" Lady Carlisle thinks he means, \" What is the scheme against me ? Do they connive at Pym's procedure ? \" When she says, \" The whole is known,\" she means that the Queen and the Lords are ac quainted with Pym's doings. Strafford and Lady^ Carlisle are at cross purposes, until Strafford (1. 160) begins to speak of the ante-room's being filled with his adherents, and goes on (1. 164) to explain. 152. Conway. See II. 2, 9. 159. 1 fell on them at Durham. \" Thwarted and exasperated on all sides, he resolved to furnish one more proof (it was destined to be the last ! ) of the possibility of recovering the Royal authority, by a great and vigorous exertion. During the negotiations no actual cessation of arms had been agreed to by the Scots, and he therefore secretly despatched a party of horse, under a favourite officer, to attack them in their quar ters. A large body of the enemy were defeated by this man\u0153uvre, all their officers taken prisoners, the army inspirited, and the spirit of Strafford himself restored.\" \u2014 Forster's Strafford, 378. 164. Full proof, Sec. Clarendon says : \" It was believed by some (upon what ground was never clear enough) that he made haste then to accuse the Lord Say, and some others, of having induced the Scots to invade the kingdom.\" There is no doubt about the matter on far better evidence than Clarendon's. 166.

There is a delightful account in a letter, written to Strafford when his house in Yorkshire was being enlarged, of Mistress Ann's complaining very much of two rainy days, which, she said, hindered her from coming down, and the building from going up, because she was expected to keep her chamber, and could not overlook the workmen.

Browning's A Toccata of Galuppi's. 40. Consign To the low ground once more the ignoble Term, And raise the Genius on his orb again. The Term was a statue, representing the Roman Term, the god who presided over boundaries. The figure was an ignoble one, with ignoble attributes. The Genius was the image that represented the guardian spirit who was supposed to accompany every created being from the cradle to the grave. The Boman Genius corresponded to the Greek daimon geneihlios. This spirit, as the in stigator of a man's actions, was a representative of his main endeavour. The Genius of a male person was represented as a beautiful boy, with a chlamys on his shoulders , and with the wings of a bird. The Juno, or Genius of a female, was represented as a maiden, draped, and with the wings of a bat or moth. In Mr. Browning's own words, \" Suppose the enemies of a man to have thrown down the image and replaced it by a mere Term, and you have what I put into Strafford's head.\" '\u25a0' Putting the Genius on the pedestal usurped by the Term means \u2014 or tries to mean \u2014 substituting eventually, the true notion of Strafford's endeavour and performance in the world, for what he conceives to be the ignoble and distorted conception of these by his contemporary judges. \" There are many allusions in Shakespere to the Genius, e.g. Ant. Ss Cleo. II. 3, 19 : \" Thy demon, that's thy spirit, which keeps thee.\" See also Twelfth Night, III. 4, 142 ; Julius C\u00e6sar, II. 1, 166; Macbeth, III. 1, 56. 54. Glosses. Comments. 64. Not so much as Constable. In petitioning the Parliament on Strafford's behalf, Charles said, \" I must confess, for matter of misde meanours, I am so clear in that, that though I will not chalk out the way, yet let me tell you, that I do think my Lord Strafford is not fit hereafter to serve me or the Commonwealth in any place of trust, no, not so much as that of a constable.\""], [114, "92 NOTES 71.

(The story, as told on the stage.) Is the incident of Pym's meeting Strafford at Greenwich part of the action ? Is Strafford's falling on the Scots at Durham ? (The first is not, because it is narrated as having occurred before the play begins ; the second is, because it is part of the story, though not actually repre sented on the stage.) 2. It has been said of the drama that in it there should be a sudden change from happiness to misery, or from misery to happiness. Can you trace this suddenness in Strafford's fall ? 3. What makes the tragedy in \" Strafford ? \" Compare with what makes it in \" Macbeth,\" and \" King Lear.\" 4. How far do you think it may be allowable to alter (1) historical facts, (2) historical sequence, for dramatic purposes ? Mention any instances you find of either in this play \u2014 in any play of Shakespere's. 5. Can you think of any reason why the actions of people in a political sphere should be judged by a different standard from that by which we judge those of people in private life ? (Read Gervinus's\" Shakespeare Commentaries,\" pp. 256-7.) Apply this to Strafford. 6. Can you see anything identical, or similar, in the leading motives of Strafford, Pym, and Lady Carlisle ? 7.
