There is no place, lady, where you would rest In more security, than in these halls. Blanche.

And yet you enter oft His chamber, whence all others are excluded ; Then in some hour of frank and easy converse May find the chance to urge the theme once more \u2014 You are his friend. Falk. Prince Ulric hath no friend. In the true sense of friendship, there must be Some touch of sympathy, some confidence Between two hearts, who own the gentle yoke ; But he feels naught but scorn for all mankind. Prince. In sooth, he is most strange.

Prince. Ha, ha, ha ! Wouldst thou persuade Falkland, Thou, schooled in lessons of the camp and court, That Ulric's thoughts could ever baffle thine ? Go to ! I know him to be passing strange, A freak of Nature in her wildest mood, But there is nothing dangerous in his humour, Which clings to solitude, and timeworn books, Leaving the world to act its part without him. But I detain you from the chase. Falk. To-day, My lord, I join not in the sport. 'Tis one I use but rarely to unbend my mind, When overwrought with study. Oft pursued It loses its right aim. Prince.

This Florentine was a great man in truth, For he had looked into the thoughts of men, And sought to make them wiser, but in vain. The world ever disdains its benefactors, And spurned and tortured, and bequeathed his name A sanction for all tyranny. When kings Would add another wrong unto the many They have conferred upon mankind, they say We conned the lesson with Machiavel. He too hath taught me lore, which I will use For my own purposes, yet ne'er accuse His conscience.

It is my wonted custom, when alone, To speak my thoughts somewhat too loudly ; yet Beware, sirrah, thou lend'st no ear to them. Caspar. I feared you might be ill, and hurried hither. But not to play the spy, my lord ; such baseness Belongs not to my nature. Ulric. How, in tears ? Methinks that I have done him wrong. He seems Almost to love me. No ! there's none on earth Could ever love this mean distorted form, This visage scarce impressed with Nature's seal. The raven finds a dusky mate, the owl Receives an answer to his hideous call, The serpent coils itself around his fellow, But there is none of human kind but would Shrink from my foul embrace.

Our quarrel rose not on such theme, my lord. Ulric. What was't then ? speak, I charge thee. Caspar. Good my lord, I pray you pardon me. He spake some words That chafed me sorely, tho' 'twas naught but folly, To heed the coxcomb. Ulric. Ha ! he called me hunchback, Cripple, ha ! and thou stood'st by and smiled. Avaunt ! or I will show thee that the hunchback Hath strength enough left in his sinews yet, To take thy wretched life. Avaunt, avaunt ! [Drives Caspar out. Enter Falkland. Falk.

The flight of time is measured by the sand That falls from the revolving hours, to some, But others count the pulse within their breast, And need no other faithful monitors. Join you the chase to-day? 'tis somewhat late. Falk. Anon, the Dady Ida reads with me Some pages of Italian verse. Ulric. Your pardon. I forgot in sooth, you were her master In the sweet lore. Certes, the task is pleasant And yet, take heed, it prove not dangerous ? Falk. How so, my lord ? Ulric. Ida is young and fair. Thy heart may beat too warmly at her side.

Yet hearts oft are won Unsought, tho' oft refused to those who sue ; 'Tis one of love's strange phantasies. Falk. But she Could never change ; her nature is too noble. Ulric. She hath changed once, and so may change again. Thou hast not heard perchance, that in her cradle She was betrothed to me, by our sires' will \u2014 I had no choice in't either. We were bound, Like slaves to wear our fetters, as we might \u2014 But she broke hers, and I am free henceforth. Doubtless thou think'st that there is ample room To choose between my foul, unsightly limbs And stalwart form of Sigismund ; and yet She might have grown into some hideous thing And she had still been mine.

Some day ! ay, there may come a day Love may adopt me for his oracle. My shape would grace his altar well, eh, Ida ? Ida. Thou lay'st too great an emphasis upon Man's outward form. Woman is sooner won By generous feelings, high, aspiring thoughts, Than the mere beauty of her lover's mien. It is the magic of a mind superior, That binds her heart. Ulric.

(To Sigismund) Take then This ring, the one you gave me with your vows \u2014 Now you are free, farewell. Prince. What means this folly ? Ulric. Lovers oft fall out ; 'tis their sweet pastime.

I ne'er thought Such passion lurked beneath a mien so calm \u2014 Yet mine is calmer still, and none suspect The lava till it burst its bounds. He comes ; He must have found the scroll, I dropped.

I ne'er dreamed of aught So foul as this. Hast thou good cause to urge Thy trembling doubts ? Sigis. I have no doubts, but are Resolved to proofs. Such doubts are for the happy, Who have something to lose. I have lost all. Ulric. Thou hast become a sage o' sudden. Wisdom Is not the child of years, the price of toils \u2014 A look, a word, wrong, convey it to the soul With shock electric, that o'ermasters hope. One instant and our hand hath plucked the fruit, Which long had hung suspended o'er our head, And evil lies before us, where to choose, Among its many paths, the gates of Eden, For ever shut on our return !

Ulric. He is not robbed, Who knows not of his loss. Sigis. My heart, methinks, Would guess th' imposture, if its pulses beat One moment on the wanton's shameless breast. Ulric. Alas ! alas ! through life, things are not what They seem to our distempered gaze.

What is my fault that he should rate me thus ? Ulric. Ida, he hath but caught my bitter phrase. Ida. Alas ! I fear his noble mind is touched By some infirmity we cannot trace. Ulric.

Suspicion is love's attribute. He doubts, Who loves too well. Indifference alone Believes 'tis ever met with equal warmth. Falkland ever at thy side hath been. Ida. Falkland ! The friend he most commended to my favour. Ulric. Perchance he deems your heart might follow his, And so esteem the friend more for his merit, Than the warm praise. Ida. I thank thee for the hint.

'Twas wrought with spells and charms and incantations, Such as in days of eld could bind dark spirits, Within a magic circle ; ay, 'tis said, That wine or aught of wholesome nourishment, Poured in the cup, doth turn to deadly poison, Swift, loathsome, deadly poison, if false lips Approach the brim.

Look in thy soul ; if thou spiest a doubt, That stands between thee and our marriage faith, Let it be thy preserver. Ida. I have none Of my love, or of thine. Why should we fear To drink ? Sigis. Once more bethink thee, 'tis a venture Of rash encounter. Youth is light and vain ; What oft we fondly prize one day, the next Sees thrown aside, by our capricious fancy. The rose soon withers if heaven's dew falls not ; The stars shine brightly on the stream, then pass Leaving no trembling image there ; the wind Ruffles the bosom of the flower, that closes O'er its last sigh.

Bethink then of the past, Is there no fault, that claims repentance there ? No guilt that may bring ruin on thy future, The future no remorse can e'er redeem ? Bethink you well, 'tis no light thing to die ! Ida. I know death is a sad and awful change, But why dwell on it now ? our bridal hour Is crowned with roses. Sigis. Death lurks in all things.
