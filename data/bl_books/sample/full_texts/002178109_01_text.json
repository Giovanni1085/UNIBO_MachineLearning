THIS Work being now completed, the Editor must apolo gise for not having intitled it Elements of the Natural History of the Animal Kingdom. He originally intended to have included Botany and Mineralogy in his plan ; but, the English Reader, has already so many excellent helps to the study of the former branch, that every other attempt on that subject is manifestly superfluous. With regard to the Mineralogical System of Lin n\u00e6us, he fays himself that he did not boast of it , and, Mine ralogy in the present day, has assumed a new aspect _ it is therefore judged proper to renounce, for the present at least, any introduction to that science, till some System shall appear which may be generally adopted. In prosecuting the subject os the present Volume, it appeared at first sight necessary, in a translation, to give English names to the Genera and Species _, but, as those subjects have hither to been comparatively little studied in this country, it is not surprising that our language should be inadequate to the pur pose. The generally received names are inserted, but they are few : In the genus Papilio, the names of the English Collectors are used . and, in that of Sertularia, no person will probably venture to change those of Mr Ellis : to the rest, the Editor has not presumed to give any ; ere long, no doubt, they will be imposed by some English Naturalist of eminence and authority. With regard to the terms, the mere English reader will be at no loss to find the corresponding Latin word in the Glossary. A"], [14, "C iv. ) A number of Latin terms are sometimes retained when these are either in a manner naturali_ied in English, such as Roftrum, Pro boscis, or more determinate, such as Apex, a point ; the word Puntlum having the seme English denomination. Antenn\u00e6, Pal pi, Elytra, &c. are used, as being easily learnt, and by no means of difficult pronunciation. Sessile is as intelligible as Sitting, and either must have been explained. Other latinized terms will be found, perhaps more offensive at first, to an English ear, such as porretled, turrited, &c. but custom will soon reconcile the student to the use of them. The Editor has endeavoured to give as complete a list of the natives of Britain as his reading, and his view of different col lections, could supply. At a distance from the rich cabinets of London, he is sensible that, in this respect, his attempt is still very imperfect : but a complete enumeration of species must be a work of time, and the labour of many individuals ; and he hopes the present Volumes, by facilitating the study of Natural History, will induce many to assist in investigating the produc tions of their native country. In the Infusory animals, he has given but one species of each genus : to have described all that are natives of England, would have required a separate Volume.

ENTOMOLOGY* treats of Infects, or of those ani mals which have a heart with only one ventricle, and cold white blood. Besides these characters, Insects are distinguished from other animals by the following ; they are furnished with Antennae ; they have jaws which move transversely ; they have at least six feet ; they have air-holes or spiracles along their sides, for the purpose of respiration ; they have a hard skin, or external skele ton, and they undergo several transformations. \u00a7 223. Most Insects undergo three transformations. From the egg springs the maggot or caterpillar, (larva, eruca,) Vol. II A which From imftcr an infect, and hlyn a discourse."], [16, "ENTOMOLOGY. 2 which is soft, succulent and barren ; it is employed intire \u25a0 ly in feeding, and two or three times changes its Ikin as it grows.* When the larva has attained its full growth, it changes into a Chrysalis or Pupa, which hardly encreascs in size, and is still barren. In this state Infects appear under sive different forms. viz. i. Pupa ccmpleta. When the Larva and Pupa are capa- ble of motion, when they take food and very much resemble the perfect insect, as in Spidery, Crabs, &c. 2, Pupafemi-completa. When the Pupa moves, eats, and has wing-cases; the Larv\u00e6 of these have six feet ; as in Grafs-hoppers, Bugs, Dragon-flies, &c, ?. Pupa incompleta. With motionless feet and wings j the Larv\u00e6 have sometimes six, sometimes more feet, sometimes none at all, and their motions are flow ; as many Beetles, Bees and Ants. 4. Pupa obtetla.

Of an oblong cylindrical Ihape, with no part of the body visible. The three last species of Pupa, aie often inclosed in a particular envelop which the larva prepares before it suffers its change. Some, by means of a viscous juice connect together a number of extraneous bodies, and thus construct a firm habitation, as the larv\u00e6 of Beetles, the Myrmeleon, &c. Others, particularly those of the Phal\u00e6na., by means of a viscid juice, secreted in ceitain vessels, and prepared by an organ fitted for the purpose, spin a web in which their oblong Pupa reposes. Others, as the larv\u00e6 of tbcTcnthredos, encircle themselves with a capacious network. Some larv\u00e6 are fed by the old insects in particular cells, which are shut when the animal enters into the pupa state, as in Bees and Wasps. The pup\u00e6 or chryfalids of Butterflies are sometimes at tached to walls by the hinder extremity of the body, and sometimes they tie themselvtsrby winding a thread round their * For a classification of Larvx by the celebrated Bergmann, fee Insecto- 1 'heology, p. 339."], [17, "ENTOMOLOGY. 3 their thorax, the ends of which are fastened to the sup port, as the Papilio Machaon and Podalirius. To undergo this change, some larv\u00e6 wrap themselves up in leaves ; others seek for holes in walls, or the hol lows of trees ; others go under the earth and remain there. \u00a7 224. Having remained ia the Pupa state a longer or shorter time, and having in a most wonderful manner, attained all its parts, its utmost size, and put on a very different appearance, the perfect insect bursts its prison. It is now called the Imago, infeclum declaratum, perfeilum. For the most part the perfect insect eats nothing, or mere ly fucks _he juices of flowers or the blood of animals, as Butterflies, and some of the Diptera ; but there are some which not only eat, but actually grow larger, such are the Silph\u00e6, the Curculiones, he. \u00a7,225. The body of insects is divided into the head, the thorax, the abdomen, and the limbs, (artus.) The body is hemispherical (semiglobofum,) in the Coccinella ; oval in the Chrysomeia; oblong in theTene brio; cylindrical in the Julus ; long and slender (lineare,) as in some of th** Cimices. \u00a7 2a6, The head is connected with the thorax by a very slen der neck. Inmost insects it is separated from the thorax (dtftinctum) and moveable. In some it forms one piece with the thorax, and is immoveable, (connatum, coasttunij, as in the Aranea, Scorpio, Cancer, &c. In some, as the Curculio, Panorpa, it grows narrow towards the point, (antice anguftatuni) ; in others it is narrowest behind, (poftice anguftutumj, as ill the Raphidia, Attelabus.

The parts of the mouth are the foundation of the classes and orders in the system of Fabricius, who has more accurately described them, than any other entomo logist. According to him they consist of the following distinct parts. i. The Clypeus, which covers the mouth above, (Plate V1I1. fig. i.) 2. The Labia, which close the mouth below, that the food may not fall out of it, (Plate VIII. fig .2-0 3. Mandibul\u0153, which move transversely ; they are of a horny substance, situated immediately under tbe clypeus, and shut the sides of the mouth above, (Plate VIII. fig. D.) 4. The Maxilla, which likewise move transversely ; they are often membranous, and shut the sides of the mouth below, (Plate VIII. fig. E.) 5. The Galea ; this is cylindrical, obtuse, and covers the maxill\u00e6, (Plate VI11. fig. 3, A a.) 6. The Palpi ; these are moveable, articulated bodies, sometimes two, generally four, and seldom six ; they are probably organs cf some fense ; they assist the insect in eating, (Plate VIII. sig. 3, A c c c.) 7. The Lingua spiralis ; the spiral tot.gue, which lies rolled up between the palpi, in butterflies. (Plate VIII. sig. 4. a.) 3.

The Piobtfcis ; divides at the point into two lips, and can be drawn in, (Plate V11I. fig. 7.) 10. The Hauftellum, this is horny and stands out, con- sifling often of a bi-valve vagina, (Plate VIII. sig. 80 and rif line bristles varying in number, (Plate VIII. fig, 8, b b b.) Of the above parts most insects have feur palpi, two mandibulae,"], [19, "ENTOMOLOGY. 5 Tiftaadibul\u00e6, two maxill\u00e6, a clypeus and a labium. Those that have a tongue, a proboscis or haustellum, in general want the maxill\u00e6. S 228. The naked bard eyes of insects (\u00a7 78) differ from those of other animals in being motionless, and in being composed of numerous hexagon plates. (Plate VIII. fig io- it-) In some, as the Monoculus, Scorpio and Ara r.ea, they are simple ; and in the Cancer, some Cimices and the Diopfis, they are moveable and are supported 0:1 a peduncle. Most insects have two eyes ; the Gyrinus has four. Most spiders and scorpions are furnished with eight simple eyes. (Plate VIII. fig. 15. a.) One spider has six. They are situated for the most part on the sides of the head, and are distant from each other, sdistir.cli.J In the Mcnoculus, they are close, (approximatt) : in Ipiders they are arranged along the sorehead (frontalcs,) and in scorpions on the sides and back of the thorax- In general the eyes are prominent, as in butterflies, the Cicindela and Caiabus ; in the Monoculus they are inferred in the cm it or sliell which covers the body, (testa innaii ,-) in some crabs and lantern-flies, they lie in appropriate depressions, and in some beetles, they aie covered above. In figure the eyes are spherical (g/obo/i,) as in spielers ; long as in theLampyris -, kidney lhaped as in wasps, &c- \u00a7 229. Besides these larger eyes, many infects have three small spherical bodies placed triangularly on the crown of the head, cailed ocelli or /lemmata- (Plate VIII- si.-. 6- f.

They are commonly seated on the forehead between or before the eyes ; sometimes, as in the Cerambyx, upon the eyes ; and sometimes under them, as in the Fulgora, the Notonecta and Nepa. Sometimes they are very fliort, (brevifsima), as in the Notonecta, Hippobosca, &c often shorter than the body, (breves \\) ; of the same length with the body, (mediocres), in some Cerambyces, as the Cerambyx edilis ; and in some Grylli they are longer than the body, (longiffima.)

The trunk (truncus*) confists in most insects but of one articulation ; in some of two, and sometimes of three, as in many of the Neuropterous insects, and sotne others, as the Sphex inaarata. The upper part of the trunk is called the thorax, the under the breast (peclus). Behind the thorax lies a small appendage called the Scutellum. \"With regard to the varieties in the form of the thorax, the following are the most remarkable. It is small, (linearis) in the Mantis ; round, (orbieulatus), in the Silpha ; oval in the Carabus ; angulated in the Grv! lus; globular in the Leptura Aiictis, detrtta, Sic. ; cylin- drical * This ten*, seems to be a.iplied by Linn\u00e6us and other Ento- HBclot-i.ts to .he thorax alone."], [21, "ENTOMOLOGY. 7 drical in the Cerambyx scalaris ; depressed as in the Silpha; compressed as in the Grylli, and some Cicad\u00e6, &c. With respect to its surface it is smooth (laevis, glaber) ; hairy, (pilofus) ; as in Butterflies ; villofus, in the Cerambyx, baiulus ; pubefcens, in some Elateres *, hispidus, in the Scarab\u00e6us Indus ;setofus, in some Mulc\u00e6 *, rugosus, in the Cerambyx Cerdo ; fulcatus, in the Scara b\u00e6us didymus ; plicaius, in the Cancer Pagunts ; punc tatus,fcaber, in many insects ; bilobatus, as in the Sca rab\u00e6us bilobus ,* tuber culatus, as in many Scarab\u00e6i *, verrucofus, as in the Grylli, &c. ; aculcatus, in the Can cer, Hifpa ; cor nut us, as in some Sc_vab\u00e6i ; carinatus, as in some Grylli ; and the carina sometimes serrated, as in the Gryllusy_'/-/v7i';/j*. On the sides it has sometimes a rim, (margiruilus), as in-the Silpha and Tenebrio ; set with spines, (/pinofus\\ as in the Cerambyx ; dentatus in the Cerambyx coriatius : ciliatus, in the Aphis and Monoculus ; foliaceus, in tbe Mantis. It is generally sliorter than the abdomen ; in some species of the Curculioand Mantis, it is nearly as long. In the Cancer and Monoculus it is covered with a hard shell, {teftaius, incruftatus.) \u00a7 233- The Scutellum is separated from the thorax by a transverse line, and lies between the wings or wing cases ; the particular use of this part is unknown. Fa bricius thinks it assists the expansion of the wings in flight ; but many insects want it, [infecla exfcutellata), as all the Lepidoptera and some of the Coleoptera, though these expand their wings as well as those that are fur nished with it, (fcutellata.) In general it is shorter than the abdomen ; in some species of the Cimiees and Grylli, it L longer than the abdomen. It is variously shaped: it is almost round, in the Scarab\u00e6us ; oval in the Cerambyx ; triangular in some Scarab\u00e6i ; quadrangular in the Sphex ; m some Cimiees it covers the whole abdomen, ( feutatum ;)"], [22, "8 ENTOMOLOGY, (sndcitum ;) i:i others it is divided at the point (biden. tut urn. ) \u00a7 234- . . The slarnum is a tidge running under the breast; it is sometimes short (abbveviatum) ; sometimes long.(<?/-.\u00ab\u00a3.*\u25a0 turn), as in the Buprestis ; sometimes divided (bifidum), as in the Dyticus latissmus ; sometimes pointed (acumi naium, mucronatum), as in the Elater ; sometimes it is armed with a spine, as in the Dyticus piceus ; and some times with a horn, as in the Buprestis fternicornis. \u00a7 235* . The abdomen consists of articulated rings, differing in number, which have spiracles or air holes (fpira ai/a.) on the fides; the upper surface of it is called the teigum, the under the venter. Many of the varieties of the thorax are likewise common to the abdomen ; but the following are pe culiar to it : the form is sometimes conical, as in the Apis conica ; club-shaped, (falcaiuni), as in the Ichneu mon ; hook shaped (bamofum), as in the Conops ferru ginca ; lance shaped, (lanccolatwis), as in the Sphinx. The end of it or the tail, [cauda) is pointed, as in the Mordella ; with a sharp point, (mucronata), as in the Si- rex ; or with a sting, (aatleata), as in the Hymenoptera. Sometimes it is set with hairs, (barbata), as in the Sphinx Jlellatai um, _kc. sometimes with bristles, (setosa), as in the Ephemera ; divided, (bifurca), and bent in, (inftexa), as in the Podura ; sometimes it ends in a kind of forceps, (forcipatai), as in the Forficula and Libellula ; or in a claw, (chclata) as in the Panorpa. The sting, (aai.'cus) is generally a very fine sharp- pointed tube, that either lies in a particular sheath, (*-_\u25a0_.- viiiciius), and is then exserted ; or within the abdomen, (reconditus). It serves Infects as a weapon ot defence, and likewise for perforating the places in which they deposit their eggs ; and accordingly the females are most com- monly furnished with it. \u00a7 236- Most insects have six feet ; Spiders have eight. The Onisci and Scolopendr\u00e6 have still more, and the Kili have"], [23, "ENTOMOLOGY. 9 have sometimes upwards of an hundred feet. In those that have six, they are generally attached to the breast, (peclorales), or four to the breast and two to the abdo men, (abdominales), or two to the breast and four to the abdomen. In the Cancer dorsipes some are attached to the back, (dorfales), and the Juli have some attached to the tail, (caudales). Each leg (pes) consists of the femur, tibia and tarsus, which last is made up of several articulations, and often at the end is furnished with claws, (unguiculatus ), as in the Scarab\u00e6us, Gryllus, Asilus, and Hippobosca. In the Cancer, Scorpio, and others, the fore-feet, (brachia), end in chel\u00e6, (manus). The feet are formed in some for running, (curforii), and are generally equal in length ; in others, as in some Butterflies, they are formed for walking, (grejforii), and the forefeet are then the shortest. Sometimes they serve for digging, (fosforii), as in the Gryllus Gryllotalpa, in which the tibia is compressed and dentated ; sometimes for leaping, (saltatorii), with long and strong hind-legs ; or for swimming, (natatorii), when they are situated nearly in a horizontal position, are compressed, and fringed with hairs, as in water insects. The males of some insects, as the Dyticus and Sphex, have on the fore-feet small cups or plates, convex above and rough below, with which, at the time of pairing, they seize and retain the female. The wings of insects are attached to the thorax ; and are either of a horny or membranaceous substance. The horny wings cover the membranaceous ones and the ab domen, and are called the wing-cases, (elytra). The membranaceous wings have often no horny covers, and are either two or four in number. In the last cafe the hinder wings, (ala poftica), are covered by the anterior wings, (primores). Of each wing we distinguish the upper and under surface, (pagina, superior, inferior) ; the avteri rior, posterior, and interior angles ; with the anterior, pof- Vol. II. B terior,"], [24, "ENTOMOLOGY. 10 terior, and exterior margins. (See Plate VII. fig. 8., Some insects are destitute of wings, (aptera). In most cafes the elytra are separate, but they are sometimes united and form but one piece ; in this cafe the membranaceous wings and the scutellum are wanting, and the insect is incapable of flying. The inner margin of the elytra, which, when they are at rest, are close and form a straight line, is called the sutura dorsalis, longi tudinalis ; the anterior, by which the elytra are connec ted with the thorax is called the sutura transversalis ; and the outer is peculiarly the margin, (margo.) On account of the various figure of the elytra it is likewise found necessary to distinguish the base, (bafts), the sur face, (discus,) and the points, (apex)'. Sometimes the hard part of the elytra are furnished at the apex with a membranaceous appendage, and are then called Hemelytra. \u00a7 238- In general the elytra cover the whole abdomen ; but sometimes they are short, (abbreviata, dimidiataj, as in the Meloe, Necydalis, and Staphylinus ; they are some times of equal breadth throughout, (linearia), as in the Cerambyx and Elater ; ' sometimes growing gradually narrower, (attenuata), as in the Leptura. At the apex they are rounded, (rotundata), as in the Gryllus ; pointed, (acuminata), as in the Tenebrio ; as if cut off transversely, (truncata), as in the Staphylinus ; notched, ( emarginata) , as in the Leptura and Buprestis gigantea. The margin is sometimes bordered, (marginata), as in the Silpha and Caslida ; toothed, (ferrataj, as in the Buprestis mariana ; or waved (ftnuata), as in the Silpha sinuata. The elytra are flexible, (flexilia), in the Cantharis ; soft, (mollia), in the Meloe ; downy or woolly on the furfacj, (tomentosa, villosa, pubescent! a) ; in the Chrysomela pubelcens, hirta . hairy, (pilofa), in the Scarab\u00e6us hirtel- lus ; smooth, (lavia) ; rough, (scabra), in the Curculio scabet ; rough with warts, [verrucosa, tuberculata),\\w the Curculia"], [25, "ENTOMOLOGY. it Curculio verrucqsus ; furrowed, (fulcata) ; striated (ftri ata); striated with raised dots, (porcata), in the Cara bus auratus ; wrinkled, (rugofa), in the Silpha rugofa, and Carabus coriarius ; streaked with other colours, (lineata), in the Chrysomela fastuosa, cerealis, and Elater lmeatus ; set with strong stiff hairs, (hispida), in the Ce rambyx hispidus ; or with spines, (spinosa), in the His pa. There are likewise some species of insects without wings, where the other species of the genus have them, as the Cerambyx pedestris, some Carabi, Cimex apterus, &c. The females of some Phal\u00e6n\u00e6 too want wings. With regard to position, the wings of some insects stand erect, (erecla), as in the Papilio ; spread out, (pa tentes), in the Phal\u00e6nae Bombyx, Geometra, &c. ; oppo site, (divaricata) _ in the Libellula ; lying over one ano ther, (incumbentes ) , in the Phal\u00e6na Noctua; hanging down, (deftexa), in the Phal\u00e6na difpar ; rolled round the abdomen, ( convoluta), in the Tineae ; reversed, {re verse), in the Phal\u00e6na quercifolia ; plain, (planae) in the Apis ; folded, (phcata), in the Vespa and Gryllus. They are either naked as in the Hymenoptera ; cover ed with scales (fquamata), as in the Lepidoptera ; hairy, (pilose), as in the Mufc\u00e6 ; of the fame colour on both sides, (concolores); spotted, (maculata);. maiked with transparent spots, (feneftrata) ; or with spots like eyes, (ocellata) ; dotted, (punclata) ; marked with stripes, (faf ciata), &c. On the margin they are tailed, (caudata) ; cornered, (angulata) as in the Papilio Rhamni ; dentated, (dentata) as in the section of Nymphales ; notched, (emarginata), as in the Phal\u00e6na Pyralis emargena ; unequally notched, (erofae), as in the Papilio C. album;, or set with hairs, (ciliatae), as in the Musca, &c. \u00a7 239- \u25a0 Insects with two wings have behind each, situated upon the thorax, a small spherical body supported* on a pedicle which is called a poiscr, (halter, libramentum), and is often protected by an arched scale. The use of this F ' B2 si"], [26, "ENTOMOLOGY. 12 is not perfectly ascertained ; it is generally believed that it serves to poise or keep the insect in equilibrium while flying ; some suppose that it makes the peculiar humming noise generally attributed to the wings. \u00a7 240. Insects are of two sexes, male and female. In Bees and Ants, the working individuals are called neuters, (neutra, spadones), and are supposed to be barren. Some late observations, however, shew that they, at least the working Bees, lay eggs, and that by superabundant nourishment, they may be turned into perfect and fertile females. In the genera of Aranea, Cancer, Oniscus, and Scor pio, the male organs are double, and in some they differ as to situation. In the male Spider they are placed in the head in the form of club-shaped palpi. In the fe male they are at the origin of the abdomen. In the males of the Libellul\u00e6 they are at the breast, in the fe males at the extremity of the abdomen. \u00a7 241. The two sexes in some species of insects are sometimes very different in appearance. The females in general are the largest ; sometimes they want wings, while the males have them; as in some Phal\u00e6n\u00e6, the Lampyris noctiluca, and Termes fatale ; they are often likewise of different colours, as the Phal\u00e6na Humuli, &c. The intercourse of the sexes among insects generally happens at random, without pairing or polygamy ; for even among Bees, there is no such thing as a plurality of males ; the working Bees are females which are impreg nated by the drones. That Ants and the Termes fatale are monogamous, has been asserted, but not ascertained. Insects live but a short while after the work of gene ration is performed ; and what is singular, the male Spi ders are immediately killed by the females. Most insects are oviparous. The Aphides lay eggs at the end of Autumn, and the young produced from those eggs in the spring, are viviparous during the whole sum mer. The females of this genus without any intercourse with"], [27, "ENTOMOLOGY. ,3 with a male, produce females, which, likewise without such intercourse, are fertile to the fourth generation, ac cording to the experiments of Reaumur, Bonnet, De Geer, and others. In harvest, males are likewise pro duced, which engender with the females, and then they become oviparous. The Cocci hatch their eggs before exclusion, and the young force their way through the abdomen of the mother. The Onisci carry their eggs in a particular receptacle, from which, in process of time, the young escape. Scorpions, some flies and Mo noculi, are likewise viviparous. \u00a7 242. The females, when impregnated, deposit their eggs with great care in that particular place which afLrds the most proper nourishment to the young when excluded. But as soon as this duty is performed, they for ever a bandon them, leaving them to be hatched by the warmth of the atmosphere. Working Bees and Ants alone, of the whole tribe of insects, take any care of their larv\u00e6. Spiders carry their eggs about with them, but do not seem to assist the young in any degree, when they burst their prison. The fertility of insects is very great. The Phal\u00e6na Caja lays 1600 eggs. The Queen Bee about 4000, some fay 12000. The Flesh-fly 20,000 *. S 243- Few infects live during the winter. Some that have been produced late in the season, and which have not had an opportunity of propagating their kind, conceal themselves in holes, and appear early in the spring. \u00a7 244. Insect:- are found in every part of the world, even in the smallest islands. In very cold regions they are not numerous. They live in every situation ; on land and in the water ; in fresh waters as well as in the sea. Many inhabit the water in their larva state, then go below ground to pass the period of their existence as a Pupa, and \u2022 For the numbers of Inseas fee Infecto-Theology, P. 321."], [28, "ENTOMOLOGY. 14 and, when become perfect insects, they mount into the air. Their food is various. Some live on filth, and on carcases ; some on living animals ; man himself is obnox ious to their attacks ; and many feed on plants. Some migrate from one region to another, as the Locusts, and some species are as extensively spread over the face of the earth as the plants on which they feed. Larv\u00e6 often feed on matters which, when perfect in sects, they will not touch. Many gnaw the roots of plants, as the larv\u00e6 of the Meloe, and of several Phal\u00e6 n\u00e6 ; others penetrate the wood, as the Ptinus ; and most of them eat the leaves. Such as live on other larv\u00e6, must employ various artifices to entrap their prey, such as the Formicaleo, the Water Scorpion, &c. The perfect insects likewise live on food of different kinds; for the most part they fuck the juices of other animals and plants, as Butterflies, Musc\u00e6, &c. some in this state never take any nourishment, as the Ephemera, &c. \u00a7 245 _ Insects are furnished with particular organs for avoid ing or resisting their enemies. Besides their eyes, by which they quickly discover approaching danger, they are provided with weapons of defence, such as hairs, spines, stings, &c. Some discharge a fluid, as the Phal\u00e6 na Cossus, the Silpha, the Carabus, &c. The Cicadae conceal themselves in a froth- The Phryganeae make artificial cases and sometimes abodes under ground. The Tortrices wrap themselves up in a leaf. Some of the Tine\u00e6 live between the two membranes of a leaf, &c. Others avoid danger by leaping, as the Elater, the Chrysomela oleracea, the Grylli, the Cicadae, &c. ; others by running, as the Carabi, the Cicindelae, &c. The Cimiees protect themselves by dispersing a fetid smell. Some Caterpillars have the appearance of a piece of yitheied stick ; and others are so like in colour to the plants on which they feed, as to be with difficulty dis tinguished from them. In"], [29, "ENTOMOLOGY. rj S 246. In the economy of nature insects are principal agents. They perform their functions chiefly in the day ; bus some only in the evening and at night, as Moths, the Dytici, &c. By them chiefly is the proportion main tained between the vegetable and the animal kingdoms, ( \u00a7 112). They purify the atmosphere by feeding on the putrid carcases of animals, as the Silphae, the Staphylini, Tenebriones, &c. ; the larvae of Flies, such as the Musca putris, ftercor aria, fimetaria, &c. feed on the dung ot other animals . the larvae of some Beetles penetrate rot ten wood, and accelerate its conversion into earth ; the larvae of Gnats purify foul and stagnant waters, and re store their fluidity. Many diminish the numbers of other insects ; thus the Spheges, the Carabi and Cicindelae, devour larvae ; Spi ders, the Asili, and Mantes, prey on other insects ; the Aphides are preyed on by Coccinellae and some Muscae. Many insects, particularly the larvae of the Lepidop tera, Beetles, and Grylli, live on plants and weeds, and prevent their too great increase ; tbey are also of advan tage to fruit trees, by feeding on the superfluous leaves. Every plant maintains some insect, and some of them more than one kind ; there are plants, particularly the poisonous ones, that seem to have been created purpose ly as food for particular insects. Others assist the fructification of plants ; the Cy nips Pfenes and Sycomori, carry the farina fecundans to the female fig, and the Tipula pennicornis to the Aristo lochia. The immense quantities of insects which are produced, must enrich the ground when they die. Besides, insects furnish the proper food of many other animals, particularly of various Birds, Amphibia, and Fishes. Even some Quadrupeds feed on them exclu sively, such as the Ant-eaters. Many of them are emi nently useful to man. Crabs, and the larger Locusts, are frequently eaten. Bees and Wasps prepare for him honey and wax- Some produce cochenille, others galls, and others silk. Medecine and the Materia Medica are also indebted to some of the animals of this class. Oa"], [30, "ENTOMOLOGY. 16 On the other hand, Insects are noxious to man ia many respects. Many Caterpillars lay waste the mea- dow , fruit trees and plants. Tsie Curculio granarius, frumentarius , and Tinea granella, &c. gnaw the feeds of corn. The Chryfomela oleracea feeds on the seminal leaves of tender plants, and the Locusts often destroy the produce of whole regions. Some eat the roots of plants, and others feed on the wood. Bees suffer from the Tinea mellonella* Pyralis cereana and Attelabus apia- rius. Horses, Goai-s, Rhen-deer, Oxen, Sheep, &c. are infested by the Oestrus, Tabanus, Conops, and o- ther insects. The furniture of houses is destroyed by some, and man himself is not exempted from the at- tacks of many species. \u00a7 2-47- Of Books on Entomology, which are very numerous, the following are the principal.

COLEOPTERA. With crustaceous wing- cases, and for the most part with two wings. (Plate VII. fig. 1.) Order"], [33, "ENTOMOLOGY. l9 Order II. HEMIPTERA. With the upper wings half crusiaceous, and half membranace- ous ; not divided by a longitudinal su ture, but crossed or incumbent on each other; or with four wings. (Plate VII. %\u2022 2, 4). Order III. LEPIDOPTERA. With four wings co- vered with fine scales, like powder ; and with a spiral tongue. (Plate VII. fig. 8. ti.) Order IV. NEUROPTERA. With four membra- neous transparent wings, generally reti culated with veins or nerves. (Plate VII. fig- '5- Order V. HYMENOPTERA. With four mem- braneous wing.- ; the tail furnished with a sting. (Plate VII. fig. 18.) DIPTERA. With two wings only. (Plate VII. fig. *_o Order VI. Order VII. APTERA. Without wings. (Plate VII# fig- 23). \u00a7 249. The generic characters are taken from the Antenn\u00e6 ; the parts of the mouth, the structure of the head, tho rax, and abdomen; the habit, the metamorphosis, and manner of life, have often so much resemblance, as to assist in distinguishing the species of a genus. But the species are chiefly determined by the colour, and by the various structure of the particular parts. C 2 \u00a7 230"], [34, "\u20223a ENTOMOLOGY. \u00a7 24\u00a9. The system of Fabricius has acquired great reputation on the Continent. It is not so simple or so convenient as that of Linn\u00e6us ; it is founded on the parts of the mouth which are often very small, and so minute as to require the aid of a magnifier. But he has described these parts so accurately, (\u00a7 227.) that many of them have since been made use of in characterising the Gene ra. It may not therefore be amiss to give a sketch of his arrangement. He divides insects into eight classes. Class I. ELEUTERATA. Mouth armed with maxill\u00e6, and four or six palpi. The maxill\u00e6 naked and free. Class If. ULONATA. The maxill\u00e6 covered with an obtuse galea. SYNISTATA the labium. Class III. The maxill\u00e6 united with Class IV. AGONATA. The under maxilla want- ing. Class V. UNOGATA. Mouth armed with max- ill\u00e6 and two palpi ; the under maxilla generally furnished with a small unguis or nail. Class VI. GLOSS ATA. Mouth furniflied with pal- pi, and a spiral tongue. Class VII. RYNGOTA. Mouth furnished with a rostrum, and an articulated vagina Class VIII ANTLIATA. Mouth furnished with an haustellum j and a vagina not articulated. Though"], [35, "ENTOMOLOGY. ar Though some of these classes are natural, others of them include insects of very different forms and man ners. Thus, for instance, the Class Synistata includes the Ephemera and the Oniscus, the Vespa and the Mo noculus ; and in the Class Unogata, we find the Sco lopendra and Aranea, joined with the Libellula. We now proceed with the arrangement of Linn\u00e6us. \u00a7 256. Order I. COLEOPTERA. * The Insects of this Order (the Eleuterata of Fabrici us), make a very natural division. They have hard cas es to their wings, with a longitudinal suture ; these in some are united, and therefore such insects can have no wings ; but the wings in most are two. At the mouth in general they have four, seldom six palpi ; two horny and two coriaceous maxill\u00e6 ; the mouth is covered above with the clypeus ; and closed below by the lips : they have all six feet in their perfect state ; for the most part eleven articulations in the antenn\u00e6 which lie be tween the two reticulated eyes ; they have a hard horny skin ; on each side they have nine spiracula, one on the thorax, and eight on the abdomen. The females lay their eggs in the earth, in wood, &c. and from these pro ceed the larv\u00e6. The larv\u00e6 have six short feet near the head ; jaws at the mouth ; two eyes ; often short antenn\u00e6 ; and on each side nine spiracula. They feed mostly on plants and their roots ; they move slowly ; others live on dead ani mals, and these are more active _, others, as the Dyticus, which * From Kt>,i\u00bb. a ihcuth or cafe, and -tt-j-j -tt-jj.. a wing."], [36, "INSECTS. 22 which feed on living animals, are very rapid hi their mo\u00ab tions. The larva state, during which insects change their skins, endures in most species for a year ; in the larger species longer, sometimes three or four years. When the larva arrives at its appointed time, it draws itself together, and changes for the most part into a Pu pa incompleta,(\\\\ 223) which, sometimes below the earth, or in rotten wood, reposes for several weeks or months. In some species the Pupa issemi-completa. Afterwards the Ikin of the Pupa bursts, and the perfect insect appears. It is now fit for the propagation of the species. Some live on plants and others on animal bodies- In respect of structure, size, motion, colour, manner of life and properties, they are different. Gen. I. SCARAB\u00c6US. The antennae clavated ; the club lamellated ; four palpi ; the mandible hor- ny, in general without teeth ; the tibiae, or second joint of the foremost pair of feet, generally dentat- ed. This is a very numerous genus, containing no less than 433 species \u2022, but it has been divided by Fabricius into six ge nera, each of these in the Systema Natur\u00e6, forming only se parate sections. Thus the first section contains the Scarabsei of Fabiicius, &c. as follows ; * With filiform palpi. f The mandible arched. a. Evidently without teeth. Scarab\u0153i. b. Somewhat dentated ; the abdomen at the apex not covered with the elytra, which are oblique- ly truncated. _ Melolonthae. ff The mandible straight. \"\u2022 acute- Cetoni*. b. obtuse.

The larvx of the Scarab\u00e6i have six feet, they are annulat ed, hairy, with a vesicle at the apex of the abdomen ; they have a hard horny head ; they live inactively under ground ; many of them are fond of dung, and feed upon it ; the larv\u00e6 of the Cetoni\u00e6 feed on putrid wood ; those of the Me lolonthce on the roots of plants- The Pup\u00e6 lie motionless under the soil. * Scarabaei. a.

When it flies in the evening with a loud hum, it presages a fine day. By the Egyptians it was consecrated to the Sun. It lives below ground. The female digs a hole, and kneads a lump of fresh dung, generally of a cylindrical sliape, on which stie de posits one egg, apd then covers it with more dung, attaching it to the root of some grafs. In a few days the larva breaks the egg and feeds on the fresh dung ; during the autumn it changes its skin four times, and continues in an inactive state during the winter ; in spring the beetle appears. It some times varies in colours, verging to bluish or greenisl.. It is much infested by the Acarus Coleopterorum and the Ichneu mon. 19. Scarab\u00e6us vernalis.

Inhabits Europe, particularly the northern parts. B. The Cock-chafer flies in the evening, and lives on the leaves of trees, particularly the maples, but does not touch the lime; when it is numerous in autumn, it is laid to pre sage diseases ; oil in which it has beeh infused expells bugs ; it is eaten by Turkeys and by the Bat. The female digs a hole about half a foot deep, and there deposits her eggs, from which proceed larv\u00e6 with fix feet of a white or greyish co lour, which feed on the roots of plants, particularly of corn, for four years, changing their skin at least once a year. They are a favourite food of Crows. In winter they go deep into the soil to preserve themselves from the cold, and eat noth ing.

It is extirpated by the Attelabus formicarius. 2. Ptinus mollis. Of a brick colour ; the eyes brown. Inhabits Europe. B. The three last articulations of the antenn\u00e6 are longer, but not thicker than the rest ; it is destructive to dried plants, which, in order to be freed from it, must be exposed to the heat of an oven. The larva endures the greatest cold. ** With filiform palpi. Ptini. 3. Ptinus Fur. Of a brick colour ; the thorax with 4 dents ; the elytra with two white fasci\u00e6. Inhabits Europe. B. This is a most destructive insect in museums. It consumes plant**, insects, birds, skins, books, and furniture, and even snuff ; for it is not to be kept off by strong-smelling substan ces, such as Camphor. It is fond of cold and moisture, and is expelled by heat and dryness ; it is killed by arsenic and alum, but more certainly by corrosive sublimate. It resem bles a Dermestes in habit, mariners, and metamorphosis, and a Cerambyx in the lateral dents on the thorax. The female has no wings ; the larva is soft and hairy, with six feet ; the segements on the back raised ; the pupa resides in a glutinous ball. 4.

Frequent in lakes and still waters ; running swiftly in cir- cles on the surface, and when it dives carrying along with it a bubble of air, which appears like quicksilver. The female. deposits her eggs in rows on the leaves of water grasses, which are hatched in three weeks ; the larva is at first transparent, afterwards dark coloured, with a light fascia. About August it creeps to the tops of water plants, and weaves about itself a web like paper, in which it turns a Pupa. These insects live in society, and often in their brisk motions strike against one another. In the evenings they betake themselves to still places, under bridges, or under the roots of trees which grow at the water's edge. E 2 Gen."], [50, "36 INSECTS. Gen. IX.

Brown; the elytra with black inter- rupted striae. Inhabits Europe. B. Is found in sandy soils, in fields, and bv the sides of roads. It is of an oval shape ; sometimes of a black colour, which arises from the minute brown hairs that coyer the upper part of the body having been rubbed oft. 2. Byrrhus varius. Black ; thorax of a bronze colour, elytra brown ; with three abbreviated striae spotted with black and green. Inhabits France. B. Of the size and figure of the former species Gen. X. ANTHRENUS. Antennae clavated; the club solid ; palpi unequal and filiform ; the max- illa membranaceous, linear, and bifid ; the lip in- tire. These insects are found on flowers ; they are small, but in general prettily coloured. They contract on the appre hension of danger, and appear as if dead. Their larv\u00e6 arc found in carcases, skins, and dried animal substances, and they attack the insects and other objects in museums. They pass nearly a year in that state before changing into a Pupa ; the perfect insect is found chiefly in spring. i. Anthrenus Scrophulariae. Black ; the elytra spotted with wsiite ; the suture of a blood-red colour. Inhabits Europe. B. Found on flowers, particularly of the Scrophularia. The colours of this, and of the other species, are owing to small triangular scales, similar to those on the wings of But- terflies, which are easily rubbed off, when the insect appears quite black.

The antennsq and head black ; the thorax obscurely reddissi. Gen. XL SILPHA. Antennae clavated; the club perfoliated ; the elytra margined ; the head pro- jecting ; the thorax flattifh and margined. The Silpha live in dark and retired places, and those which cojnceal carcases or the excrements of animals on which they feed ; they have generally a fetid smell, and when taken, they discharge by the mouth or the anus, a drop of black liquor of a very disgusting odour ; this liquor serves to acce- lerate the putrefaction of the matters on which they feed. Their larv\u00e6 live in the earth in dung-hills and dead carcases ; they have six ssiort feet ; the head is small, armed with strong jaws ; they undergo their transformations under ground. I. Silpha Vefpillo. Oblong and black; the clypeus or- bicular and unequal ; the elytra marked with two ferruginous fasci\u00e6. / Inhabits Europe and America. B. This species is subject to vary much ; in America it is double the size that it is with us. It is infested with Acari ; it flies very swiftly with its elytra erect. The elytra are short er than the abdomen. It feeds on carcases, and a small dead animal is soon visited by a number of Silph\u00e6, which join in burying it after they have deposited their eggs in its body. Thus a mole or a mouse is often buried by the industry of four or five of them in the space of four and twenty hours. They scoop out the earth all round and below the animal, which gradually sinks down, and while the agents are invisi ble, we see the effects by the disappearance of the carcase. They undergo their changes iu the earth. 3. Silpha rufifrons. Oblong, smooth, and black ; the forehead, the feet, and two spots on the elytra, of a ferruginous colour. Inhabits England. \u25a0x.

The elytra project over the sides, and totally cover the whole body, so that no part of t is seen. The larva has six feet, and feeds on the thistle; it is broad, short, and depressed with acute spines on the fides ; its tail is recurved, and terminates in a sort of fork, between the prongs of vhich is the anus. By this means the excrements of the animal are retained on the fork, and accumulated, so \u00ab to form a parasol ; and when they are dry they are thrown off, and fresh substituted. The larva often changes its fk n, the fragments of which are sometimes found in the above mentioned mass. The Pupa is broad, flat, and almost oval, surrounded with a number of fringe-like appen dages, and before with an arched band. It is of a pale green, and found on thistles.

Antenn\u00e6 filiform; palpi four, securiform; when laid on its back the insect leaps by means of a spine in its breast, springing from a cavity in the under side of the abdomen. Many of the coleopterous insects hare a great difficulty in restoring themselves when laid on the back ; the apparatus with which the insects of this genus are provided for that purpose, is singular and curious. An elastic spring or spine projects from the hinder extremity of the breast, and there is a groove or cavity in the anterior part of the abdomen. When laid on its back, the insect raises and sustains itself on the anterior part of the head, and the extremity of the body, by which means the Ipine is removed from the groove where it is lodged, when in its natural position ; then sudtienly bend ing its body, the spine is struck with force across a small ridge or elevation, into the cavity from whence it was withdrawn, by which shock, the parts of the body before sustained in the air, are so forcibly beat against whatever the insect is laid on, as to cause it to spring or rebound to a considerable distance. The antenn\u00e6 are lodged in a cavity scooped out of the under side of the head and thorax, probably to preserve them when the insect, falls, after its singular leap. The larv\u00e6 live in pu trid wood. I. Elater bipuflulalus . Black and shining; the elytra with a red dot at the base. Inhabits Europe. B. The"], [86, "INSECTS. 72 ELATER.

HEMIPTERA.* The insects of this Order have a rostrum at the mouth, which is inflected and bent inwards towards the breast. Their wings are hemelytrata, or of a substance less hard and strong than the elytra of those of the pre ceeding Order, but more so than the membranaceous ones of the following Orders ; they do not meet together and form a longitudinal suture, as in the foregoing Or der ; but have some part of their anterior margins cross ed, or laid one over the other, above the abdomen. Some insects of this Order have only two wings, and the females of others want wings altogether. They change into a Pupa scmicompleta. Gen. LVI. BLATTA. Head inflected. Antenn\u00e6 setaceous. Palpi unequal, filiform. Elytra and wings flat, and nearly coriaceous. Thorax nearly flat, orbicular, and marginated. Feet formed for running. Two horns above the tail in most species. The insects of this genus shun the light ; they, with their Jarv\u00e6, devour the various articles of human food, leather, and putrid substances, and elcape by running quickly ; they are find to be killed by the tmoke of pit-coal, or by the roots of the Nymph\u00e6a alba boiled in milk. i Biatta From i'^tirv, half, and -*i1.j\u00ab\u00bb, a wing"], [105, "ColeopteRa. 91 BLATTA.

Thorax smooth and subcarinated ; elytra green and not spotted. Inhabits Siberia, Austria, and Africa. This with the following species, have their trivial names from an action common to them, and most others of the genus, namely, the motion of their forefeet, which appears like that of the hands of a person praying. They go mostly on their hind feet, and move their fore feet in order to catch flies. The Turks believe that they stand with their heads towards Mecca, and move their hands in prayer to Ma homet. This species has been known to live ten years. 2. Mantis oratoria. Thorax smooth ; elytra green, the wings with a black spot ; reddissi before. Inhabits the East, and Southern Europe. Gen. L1X.

Hind feet formed for leaping. Two claws on all the feet. This is a numerous genus, and has been split into many by Fabricius ; but Gmelin has retained the generic name of Gryllus, dividing it into sections which correspond to the genera of the former Entomologist. All the Grylli, except perhaps thole of the first section, which live on other in- sects, are herbivorou- ; the Achet\u00e6 chiefly live on the roots ; the Tettigoni\u00e6 and Locust\u00e6, on the leaves. The larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 of the whole have six feet, are active, and resemble the perfect insect ; the larv\u00e6 want wings, often live under ground ; the pup\u00e6 frequently seed along with the perfect insect ; in a few species there is a glassy ocellus in the elytra, which"], [107, "Coleoptera. 93 GRYLLUS. which is the instrument of the found they make.

These curious insects, called Mole Crickets, frequent the fides of ponds and banks of streams : they burrow and work under ground like the mole, raising a ridge as they proceed, but seldom throw up hillocks. They sometimes destroy whole beds of cabbages, young legumes and flowers. At night they come abroad and make long excursions. In fine weather, about the middle of April, and at the close of day, they begin to utter a low, dull, jarring note, continued for a long time without interruption. About the beginning oi May they lay their eggs, two hundred or more, below ground, the female being exetisively solicitous to preserve them from cold and accidents. They are said to be attracted to gar- dens by horse dung, and to be expelled hy the dung of hogs. 4. Gryllus domeftkus. With tailed wings, longer than tbe elytra , feet simple, body glaucous.

They chirp the whole year round, and chiefly during the night, when they come out of their holes. They thew a great propen sity to liquids, and are frequently drowned in vessels of water, milk, &c. they are likewise very voracious. In summer they sometimes fly out of the windows, and thus suddenly quit their former haunts. Their noise is occasioned by a quick attrition of their wings. They may be taken, like wasps, by bottles filled with beer, &c. 5. Gryllus campeftris. Wings ssiorter than the body, which is black ; with a linear style. Inhabits Europe. B. These insects live in holes, in dry foils, making a very curious subterraneous abode, with regular cells. They are solitary beings. Sitting in the entrance of their caverns, they chirp all night as well as day, from the middle of May to the middle of July; the noise they make is probably to allure the females, for the males alone make the chirping. They begin to appear and to form their holes in March, and in August these holes are obliterated. ***** Antennae setaceous ; palpi unequal; the tail of the female has an enftform process- Tettigoni\u00e6- Locuft\u00e6, Fabr. 6.

A small insect ; the head and thorax with three elevated lines. It has been found in England, but rarely. Gen. LXI. CICADA. Rostrum inflected ; antenn\u00e6 setaceous ; wings four, membranaceous and deflex- ed. Feet in most species made for leaping. The Cicadae live on the juices of plants ; the larv\u00e6 want wings; the pupa has merely the rudiments of wings ; they have both six feet, and run ; they are very like the perfect insect ; the larvae of the Cercopides are the most active. The Cicad\u00e6 chirp like the Grylli. The larv\u00e6 of the Manniser\u00e6, the Tetti gometrae of the antients, burrow and live under the earth the whole year ; wf en perfect, the males chirp among the stirubs by means of two lamellae which cover the abdomen below, and in this way attract the females. * Antennae subulated, inserted in the forehead.

The larva of this species is the inhabitant of what is called Cuckoo-fpit, so frequently seen in the summer on roses, gras ses, and the sallow. Like many others of this section and the next, it discharges from the vent the froth in which it lives during its larva state. The perfect insect seldom flies, but, at one spring, it can leap the length of two or three yards. Vol. II. N 7 Cicada"], [112, "98 INSECTS. CICADA. 7. Cicada siriata.

Notonecta glauca. Elytra grey, with a brown dotted margin, bifid at the apex. Inhabits Europe. B. This insect swims on its back, but, in that situation, with great velocity darts on water insects, which are its food. Its rostrum is a weapon of defence. It drops its eggs in the wa ter, which are so heavy, that they fall to the bottom, where they remain till the larva appears. 2. Notonecta minutijjima. Grey ; the head brown ; the elytra truncated.

They exude, partly from the horns on their ab- domen, and partly from two orifices at the fame place, a sweetish juice which attracts Ants and other inimical infect.. There are often in the fame species, and even in the fame family, individuals with wings and without wings ; and that withouc any respect to the difference of sex. But the males are in general much smaller than the females,,- and' also less numerous. They seldom appear before Autumi}, when they impregnate their females, who soon thereafter lay eggs or rather a sort of capsules, in which the young Aphides lie, already perfectly formed, but 'dp not break their sliest till the following Spring When they appear jt is very re markable that they are almost wholly females, with hardly a male to be seen* during t'^e whole Spring and Summer. Notwithstanding this, all these female Aphides without any communication with a male, are able to propagate their spe cies ; and seem to ha*?e received the genial influence, not merely for themselves alone, but for their posterity to the ninth generation. , During t_ie whole Summer they are vi viparous, and if a young Aphis is taken, immediately upon exclusion from the mother, and kept apart, it will produce young ; which young, if also kept apart, will likewise produce, and so on, without the presence of a male. Towards Au tumn, however, this singular fructification begins to lose its wonderful effects. The Aphides, cease to bring forth fe1 males only ; males likewise are produced, who immediately celebrate that nuptial rite which is to communicate fertility to the whole female posterity of the following Summer. These fact, are unquestionable . and the experiments are easily made.

LEPIDOPTERA. * The insects of this Order, the Glossata of Fabri cius, which contains the various kinds of Butterflies, Moths, and Hawk-moths, have all four wings, covered with scales or a fort of farina ; they have a mouth with palpi, a spiral tongue, and a body set with hairs. The scales resemble feathers ; they lie over one another in an imbricated manner, the shaft towards the body of the insect, and the expansion towards the end of the wing; reflecting often the most beautiful colours. \u25a0 The reticulated eyes are large, and besides these, some have two or three small stemmata situated on the forehead. The palpi have from two to three articulations, they are hairy, standing outwards, and sometimes a little upwards. Butterflies, with their spiral tongue, suck the nectarious juices of flowers ; but, in general, they need little food *-. some, indeed, whose tongue is very short, seem to take no nourishment at all. They have, on each side, nine spiracula or organs of respiration, of which, one is situ ated on the thorax, the other eight on the segments of the abdomen ; the last segment is without any, but in it are contained the organs of generation- The principal function of the perfect insect is to propagate its species, for which purpose the female deposits her eggs on such plants, and in such places as afford the proper nourish ment to the larvae when excluded ; after which both. sexes very soon cease to live. Out of the eggs at length proceed the larv\u00e6, which, in this order particularly, have the name of Caterpillars j they are of a long worm-like figure, with many feet* They have, in general, a heart-shaped head, on each side of which are the eyes, each eye consisting of six small lenses, covered with the common integument ; there are likewise short hairs, and horns, of which two are larger than the others, and the foundation of the fu- P 2 ture * From te?rk a scale, and rmp\\i a wing."], [130, "116 INSECTS. ture antenn\u00e6. At the mouth are two dentated maxil l\u00e6 with two simple teeth, from two to four palpi, and the under lip, from which, by means of certain papill\u00e6, the insect draws its threads, (See plate VII. fig. 6. 9.) The elongated body has twelve proper segments, on the sides of which, as in the perfect insect, the spiracula are placed ; but the second, the third, and the last segment, have no spiracles. They open into the trachea, which runs along the sides, and is dispersed by many ramifi cations to every part of the Caterpillar. For the ana tomy of a Caterpillar, fee that most wonderfully ela borate work, Lyonet's Traite anatomique de la chenille qui ronge le bois du faule, Hague, 1762, 4to. Caterpillars, for the most part, have sixteen feet; some have fourteen, others? twelve ; the Geometr\u00e6 (Plate VII. fig. 9.) have ten, and the Tine\u00e6 but eight feet. Those feet are of two kinds ; the first six are horny, with three articulations, they end in a point and are situated under the three first abdominal segments : these are common to all Caterpillars, and afer trans formation they constitute the six feet of the perfect in sect. The hinder feet are thick, membranaceous, not articulated, and are thick set on the margins with soft hooks ; some of these are often wanting ; the two feet at the extremity of the body, are made for holding fast, and with them the Caterpillar often supports itself in a state of repose. The skin of Caterpillars is sometimes naked, sometimes hairy, sometimes set with prickles, which are either simple or branched ; sometimes fur nished with long hairs, which are either single or in tufts, &c. Some Caterpillars on the last segment are armed with a pretty strong horn. All Caterpillars are employed solely in taking food, which consists chiefly of leaves, roots, or the wood of plants ; sometimes likewise of other insects ; they change their skins in general three or four times, and transform themselves into a Pupa obtecta (Plate VII, fig. 7. and 10.) sometimes in a concealed place in the open air, sometimes between leaves, and sometimes in the earth j the Phal\u00e6n\u00e6 Bombyces spin a sort of thread or silk,"], [131, "Lepidoptera. 117 silk, of which they form a case or coccoon, for their con venient repose, during their motionless state of Pupa. At last the perfect insect bursts its prison, having lain in that state a longer or shorter time, and when it first ap pears, the developement and growth of the parts are very visible. During this progress the insect dilcharges some drops of a reddish fluid, which, when in great quantities in one place, as sometimes happens, has given occasion to the fable of showers of blood. Of the lar v\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 of the infects of this Order, the Ichneu mons are particular enemies. Gen. LXX. PAPILIO. Antenn\u00e6 growing thicker at the extremities, in general club-shaped or capi- tated. Wings, when at rest, erect, and meeting upwards. Flying by day. This genus comprehends those insects called in English Butterflies, which fly in the day. The first pair of legs in some of them, are short, and used rather as hands for clean- jno themselves, than as feet for walking. Their flight is iu geneial quick. The Caterpillars have all sixteen feet, and are for the most part prickly ; some, however, are smooth, others set with short hairs, others have a sort of tail, and some on the head have two blunt horn-like feeler*. (slate VII. fig. 6.) They change in the open air, without spinning, into a cornered pupa, which, as it sometimes has a metallic lustre, i_, in this genus peculiarly, termed chrysalis. This is attached by the tail to some wall or shaded place ; or it is fixed by a thread round the middle, the ends of which are made fast to the wall. In this state it remain. generallv about three weeks, when the perfect infect ap pears. Some, during the summer, produce two or three broods ; the last remains, during the winter, in the chryialis state, and the insect appears early in the Spring. Linn\u00e6us divides this genus, which contains 877 specie;', into six families ; the names of the first, being mostly exotic, he has taken from the Trojan and Grecian chiefs ; thole of the others, as most of them are European, and their history and manners better known, are taken chiefly from the plants on which the Caterpillars feed.

Some of the species of this genus are the largest of lepi dopterous infects.*- They fly, for the most part, early in the morning, and Lite in the evening, except the small species f the Adscit\u0153), which appear during the day. Their upper wings are longer and more narrow, and the under wings shorter than those of the Papilios. They hover about flow ers, and without fettling on them, fuck the nectareous juices with their long spiral tongue.

The antenn\u00e6 gradually attenuated from the base to the apex; the tongue spiral ; no maxill\u00e6 ; a soort horny clypeus in most species. The insects of this genus fly chiefly during the night. By day they lurk in concealed places ; but some species and even families of them fly in the day and in the evening. Even the caterpillars feed chiefly in the night. This is the most numerous genus of the whole insect tribe, there being, in Gmelin's edition of the Systema Natur\u00e6, 1534 species de scribed ; it has been divided into eight sections, according to the situation of the wings in the insect, or the form and changes of the Caterpillar. Of these sections Fabricius has made as many genera.

The Phal\u00e6n\u00e6 Attaci are, except one or two species, for eign insects ; their antenn\u00e6 are in general pectinated ; their wings somewhat declining. The caterpillars of the Bombyces have 16 feet, they are generally hairy and sohcylindrical ; the pupa is acuminated at the apex ; the antenn\u00e6 of the Moths are filiform, acute at the apex ; of the male pectinated ; of the female sometimes setaceous ; the palpi are two, compressed, reflexed, equal, obtuse, with a short, spiral, membranaceous tongue, hardly stretched out, but rather hidden, filiform, obtuse and bi- . fid. ' The Caterpillars of the Geometrar, have eight or ten feet ; fix on the three first segments ; and two at the tail, and sometimes two on the segment next the tail ; their motion in walking is somewhat like that of the Leech, or as if they were measuring or spanning the ground they traversed *, while in a state of repose they stand nearly erect *, they are smooth, and change sometimes above, sometimes under the earth. The pupa is acuminated at the apex. The Moths have filiform antenn\u00e6 ; the articulations not strongly marked, two equal palpi ; reflexed, membranaceous, and cylindrical ; the tongue stretched out, membranaceous, setaceous and bi- fid ; the wings when the inject is at rest generally spread out horizontally ; the females of some species want wings. The lortrices are small, with very obtuse wings, almost hollowed on the posterior margin ; the exterior margin is curved; the antenn\u00e6 filiform; the palpi two, equal; the tongue stretched out, membranaceous, setaceous, and bifid ; the Caterpillar has 16 feet ; it folds and connects the leaves it feeds on into a habitation. The inner margins of the wings of the PyraSdes are laid one over the other ; the wings themselves decline a little to wards the sides of the body, and in soape resemble a delta or triangle."], [157, "L__I>ID0PTE6.A. 143 PHAL\u00c6NA. triangle. The antenn\u00e6 are filiform, the articulations obso lete ; the palpi are two, equal, reflexed, membranaceous and cylindrical ; the tongue is stretc'ied out, membranaceous, se taceous and bifid,; the caterpillar has either 14 or 16 feet, and changes in a n.irrow web above ground. The Caterpillar of the NoiJuce has 16 feet and is in gen eral smooth ; and changes under the earth ; the pupa is a cuminated at the apex ; the antenn\u00e6 setaceous, not pecti nated ; the palpi two,, compressed and hairy, cylindrical and naked at the points ; the tongue stretched out, horny, setaceous and bifid. The Caterpillars of the Tinea, have 16 feet, some 14 and others only 8 ; they are slender ; some live in society, others solitary ; some are uncovered, others lurk under a membran aceous cafe which they carry along with them. They feed sometimes on leaves, sometimes on fruits ; some on woollen clothes; others reside within a leaf and eat only the pulpy part of it, without touching trie double membrane ; these have got the name of larva subcutane\u0153 ; they all change a hove ground. The Moths are small, and when they rest, roll up the small leaves for protection. Some have four, o thers only two palpi. The Caterpillars of the Ptercphcri or Alucit\u0153 have 16 feet, they are thin, broad, hairy and move slowly. They change without weaving any web, like the Papilios, and the pupa is suspended by two threads. The antenn\u00e6 of the moths are setaceous, they have two very slender palpi, which are cylin drical, filiform, reflexed, naked, and subulated at the apex , the tongue is stretched out, membranaceous, elongated, se taceous and bifid. The Caterpillars of the Hepiati have 16 feet; they are nearly cylindrical, often smooth, and live on the roots of plants; the pupa is inclosed in a case cylindrical, acuminated at the apex ; the fly has short moniliform antenn\u00e6, two equal palpi which are obtule, compressed, membranaceous, and reflexed, with the rudiment of a bifid tongue between them. f With filiform antennae. * Attaci. t.

Phal\u00e6na pavonia. The Emperor Moth. With rounded wings, clouded with grey, and somewhat fasciated ; in each a nictitating ocellus, with a trans- parent point; Inhabits Europe. B. This is the only species of the Attaci which is a native of Britain. The antenn\u00e6 of the male are more pectinated than those of the female, and the base of his posterior wings is yel- lowish. The Caterpillars are gregarious, green, and verti- cillated, with hairy red and yellow warts, on a black band ; the hairs setaceous. They are found on heath, the bramble, rose, elm, willow, and fruit-trees.

After their transfor mation, they live constantly on land, but near the water, and either feed on other insects, or take no nourishment at all, but propagate their kind ; laying their eggs either in water, or in warm earth, or in leave?. Gen. LXXIII. LIBELLTJLA. Dragon fly. Mouth armed with jaws, more than two ; the lip trifid ; antenn\u00e6 shorter than the thorax ; very slender and filiform. Wings extended ; the tail of the male is furnished with a fort of hooked forceps. The insects of this genus are well known ; they are re markable for a long slender body, and wings standing out at right angles. The larv\u00e6 have fix feet, and move with great activity in the water ; at the mouth, they are furnished with an articulated forceps ; they are very voracious, and are the Crocodiles of aqu-tic insects ; those of the last section, prey chiefly on the Diptera, the rest on the Lepidoptera. The larva and pupa are not very different ; the latter has the ru diments of wings ; in a fine warm day in June, a person standing by a pond, may observe them approach the bank for the purpose of changing their element. Having crawled up upon a blade of grass, or bit of dry wood, the skin of the pupa grows parched, and splits at the upper part of the tho rax. The insect issues forth gradually, throws off its slough, in a few minutes expands its wings, flutters, and then flies off. The sexual parts in the female are placed under the thorax, in the male, at the extremity of the body. \u2022f* Wings, when at rest, spreading out. 1. Libellula quadrimaculata.

EPHEMERA. Mouth without any mandible. Palpi four, very short, and filiform. Maxilla short, membraneous, cylindrical, connectr ed with the lip. Antenn\u00e6 short, and subulated. Two large stemmata above the eyes. Wings erect, the hind ones very small. Set\u00e6 at the tail. The insects of this genus have their name from the short ness of their life after they become perfect, for they have pre viously lived one, two, or three years in the water as larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6. Some species live only a day, and others, as it is said, only a few hours. The larv\u00e6 have six feet, and six plumated sins on the sides of the abdomen, by which they i'wim : the pupa differs little, except in having at the thorax the cases which inclose the future wings. When about to undergo the last change, which happens generally about the end of May cr beginning of June, the pupa approaches the land, and settles on a dry place ; the skin bursts at the head and thorax, and the fly immediately appears with its wings extended, and takes flight. But what distinguishes the E phemera from all other insects is, that it has still another slciri to get rid of. For this purpose it settles on a near object, a wall, or a tree, and this second operation lasts longer than the first ; sometimes it requires several hours, but in some small species only a sew minutes, to disengage the insects from this last covering. A person standing by a pond or brook, in a close evening, in the beginning ot June, will soon have his cloaths covered with these exuvi\u00e6. The crea ture being now the perfect insect, hastes away to perform the remaining function of its nature. The males fill the air for a sew hours after fun-set, and the females hover upon the surface of the water to drop their eggs. In this period of their existence they take no nourishment, and therefore soon die- The"], [225, "Neuroptera, 211 EPHEMERA. * The tail with three seta i. Ephemera vulgata. May-fly.

In the evening in the month of June, it assembles in vast numbers under trees near waters, and seems to divert itself, for hours toge- ther, ascending and descending in the air as if dancing. In the neighbourhood of Laz, in Carniola, these insects are pro- duced in such quantities that, when they die, they are ga- thered for dung to the ground by the country people, who think they have been unsuccessful, if each does not procure twenty cart-loads of them for that purpose. Their larv\u00e6 are the favourite food of fresh water fishes, as are also the flies : they are more numerous in running than in standing waters. 2. Ephemera marginata.

Four palpi : three stemmata ; antenn\u00e6 setaceous, longer than the thorax ; wings incumbent ; the hinder ones folded. The larv\u00e6 of all the insects of this genus live in fresh wa- ters, forming to themselves a case of silk, covered on the out- fide with small pieces of wood, sand, gravel, leaves of plants, &c. ; their head and thorax are horny, and they have fix feet ; they seed en aquatic plants and insects. When about to undergo their transformations, they quit their cafe, and rising to the surface of the water, they look about for a dry place on which they may prepare for appearing as perfect in- sects. Having settled, the skin of the pupa soon dries and splits ; the insect draws itself out, and, leaving its spoils, re- tires to a little distance that its parts may acquire their pro- per consistence. The smaller species, however, are not un- der the necessity of quitting the water for this purpose, but disincumber themselves sitting on the surface.

At the extremity of the abdomen, the females have a setaceous aculeus or sting, that sometimes appears without, sometimes lies within the body ; which is either used as a weapon, and, in that case, it instills into the wound an acid poison ; or to pierce the bark and leaves of trees, and the bodies of living animals, for the purpose of depositing the eggs. From these eggs, a larva is produced, which, in some, has no feet ; in others, more than sixteen. It finds its food always in the place where it is bred ; it changes to a pupa incompleta, which is inclosed in a case. Some of the insects of this order live in societies, others soli tary. Gen.

Palpi four, unequal, filiform, in the middle of the lip. Antenn\u00e6 setaceous, with more than 30 articulations. Sting exscrted, inclosed in a cylindrical sheath composed of two valves. The infects of this genus lay their eggs in the bodies of Caterpillars or Pup\u00e6, which are there hatched ; the larv\u00e6 have no feet, they are soft and cylindrical, and feed on the substance of the Caterpillar ; this last continues to feed, and even to undergo its change into a chrysalis, but never turns to a perfect insect ; when the larv\u00e6 of the ichneumon are full grown, they ifl'ue forth, spin themselves a silky web, and change to a pupa incompleta, and in a few days the fly ap pears. The genus is very numerous, containing upwards of 400 species ; it is therefore divided into sections. * With a whitish scutellum ; and antennae with while rings. 1. Ichneumon raptor ius.

Sphex fa bulofa Black and rough, the petiolus of the abdomen with two articulations, the second and thiid segments ferruginous. Inhabits Europe. B. Of this infect, the following remarkable account is given by Ray. M On the 22d of June, fays he, in the year 1667, \" I saw it dragging along a caterpillar three times larger than \" itself, which, after it had carried the length of fifteen feet \u00ab and"], [247, "Hymenoptera, 233 SPHEX. \" and upwards, it deposited near the entrance of a hole \" which it had previously dug in the earth. It then remov \u25a0 ed a little ball of earth, with which the entrance was co \" vered, and went in ; after a short stay it came out again, \" and seizing the caterpillar drew it into the hole and left 4< it there. Then taking some globules of earth, it shoved \" them one after another into the hole, and now and then \" scraping with its feet as rabbits or terriers do, it threw the \" loose earth backwards into the hole, and continued to do \" so with the globules of earth and dust alternately till the \" hole was quite filled, descending at times, as I thought, \" for tbe purpose of pressing down and consolidating tbe \" earth, and once and again flying to a neighbouring fir tree, \" perhaps, to procure turpentine to conglutinate the work. \" When the hole was filled and the surface levelled, so that \" the entrance could no longer be discerned, it took two \" leaves of fir which were lying near, and placed them close \" to the entrance, as if to mark the spot. Who, says the \" pious observer, can contemplate such things without ad \" miration and astonishment ; or attribute them to a mere \" machine !\" In this caterpillar the eggs had previously been laid, and it was to serve for food to the young Spheges in their larva state. 2. Sphex spirisex. Black ; the thorax rough and not spotted ; the petiolus yellow with one articulation, the length of the abdomen. Inhabits Europe. B. Barbut received this species from Peterborough in North- amptonshire, where it had formed its cell in the mud wall of one of the cottages on the side of a hill, and which was wrought into the appearance of a honey-comb. The eggs are laid in the back part of the cell, where the animal lives, evenly arranged, and when the time of their being hatched is near, the fly brings in a number of slaughtered in- sects for food to the expected young. She then closes up the mouth of the hole with mud, and her care is over. When the young worms hatch, they find their food ready, and when they have eaten tbtir fill, they rest and change in- to a fly. ** Antenna filiform ; the abdomen sessile. 3. Sphex viatica.

Antenn\u00e6 filiform, the first articulation the longest, and cylindrical. Eyes shaped like a crescent. Bo- dy smooth; the sting hid within the abdomen; the upper wings folded in both sexes. The insects of this genus live in society ; they prey on in- sects that have naked wings, particularly bees and flies : the larva is soft and wants feet ; the pupa is motionless, and like the perfect insect, except in wanting the wings. Wasps make a hive of a substance like paper formed of wood re- duced to a paste ; the combs are horizontal, and have only one row of hexagonal cells, flat at bottom, the mouth turned downwards, which serve only for holding the young. Every hive is begun by a mother, who at first deposits a sew eggs, from which neuters are produced, or working wasps, who assist her in increasing her work and in feeding the young afterwards produced. Neither males nor females are pro- duced till towards the month of September. Before that time there are none in the nest but the female and the neu- ters she had engendered. The females remain in the nest. The males do no work. Wasps feed their larv\u00e6 with in- sects, meat, and the fragments of fruits. Towards autumn, they kill such of the larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 as cannot come to per- fection before the month of November. The males and neuters perish of themselves during winter, and none remain but some females to perpetuate the species. * Antennae thickest at tie extremity. 1. Vespa Crabro. The Hornet.

The insects of this genus live in society, they build hives, seeding on the nectar of flowers, honey, and (wect fruits ; the larva is soft, without feet, and like the perfect insect. Bees, Wasps, and Ants, are the only animals in nature, so far as is hitherto known, which have individuals belonging to neither lex, being perfectly iieuier. The experiments of some late naturalists to shew that the neuters can be trans formed into females, are not sufficiently strong to overturn a doctrine which has prevailed for a thousand years ; and ana tomy affords a light on this iubje:: which cannot deceive; for, whoever has diff ctcd various Bees, must know, that the organs of generation are wanting in the neuters, or if they have the female parts, as some maintain, that these pans are so small as to be of no use, and that the female has no or gans for the preparation of wax.

This species makes its nest in the earth, and even in the solid timber of growing trees ; it forms cylindrical cavities, lined in the inside with rose leaves, applied to the apartments in a very curious manner. The parent Bee flies to the orifice of the perforation with a leaf, where she clips it round to the size of the hole ; this is forced to the bottom of the low- est cell ; about 7, 8, or 10 of such pieces form the first lay- er ; she next forms the sides or cylindrical part of the lining ; this is done by laying several whole leaves, partly over each other, and cementing them together with a glutinous sub- stance ; thus the sides and bottom, each consisting of several layers, being finished, (in the form of a thimble) the Bee partly fills it with a kind of paste, then throws over it a small quantity of leaves, reduced to powder, and deposits the egg ; the covering to the whole is formed of the fame materials, and in the fame manner as the bottom ; when she has for- ced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the ave- nue, and cemented them to the top, the covering is fi- nished, a'nd the egg is completely secured from accident. In ' this manner she proceeds, and finishes every cell distinctly, till the perforation is intirely filled : in some trees, 40 or 50 such perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other. The Bee comes forth in August. Donovan. 4. Apis punclata. Black, and covered wiih a cinereous down ; the abdomen black ; the segments mark- ed on each side with a white dot ; the scutellum entire.

This insect, whole use to mankind is so important, whose history is so remarkable, and whose manners are so curious, deserves particular notice. A hive generally contains from 16 to 20,000 Bees, of which one only is a female, about 1500 are males or drones, the rest are neuters or working Bees. Upon these last depend the various labours of fabri- cating the combs, making the honey, and feeding the young. Some of them, particularly the younger ones, go abroad to collect the pollen of flowers, which they do sometimes at the distance of miles, and bring it home to the hive, where the older ones receive it from them, and with it feed tbe mag- gots. They likewise suck the nectar of flowers, a sweet juice- residing in a particular receptacle, and which probably all flowers aie possessed of; this they elaborate into honey by a peculiar organ, and dikharge upon returning to the hive. They feed the larv\u00e6, keep the hive clean, and carry out any dead bees. They are provided with an acrid poison and a sting, which they use as weapons of defence, but which they \u25a0an only use once in their lives, for when they exert their sting they cannot withdraw it, on account of its serrated edges, but leave it in the wound, along with a part of their bowels, so that they generally fall a sacrifice to their resent- ment. A (ingle swarm of Bees has been known to sting two horses to death. The drones are mere idlers, and have no other business in the hive than to impregnate the female, and this, it is said, contrary to the general rule of nature, ility must be courted and excited by her to do. Many die as soon as this necessary business is performed ; the rest are, some months afterwards, teased, not stung, to death by the neuters. The female now deposits her eggs in cells destined Vol. II. H h for"], [256, "\u202224a INSECTS. APIS. for their reception *. those that are to produce drones in cells larger than the rest. When this progeny, which generally consists of about 6 or 7000, has arrived at the state of perse St insects, they separate themselves from the parent colony, and swarm. If there are more females than one in this swarm, they fight with one another, and the victorious party is ac knowledged by the swarm as Queen. The cells, which are hexangular, and about six lines deep, are made of wax, and serve in the first place as the residence of the maggot, and then as a receptacle for the honey. The comb consists of two rows of cells, whose bases form the partition between the two rows ; they are placed nearly horizontally, the mouth being raised a little, probably to retain the honey. The larva is hatched in about five days after the egg is deposited in the cell, and in seventeen days more it becomes a perfect insect. Bees extract honey from most plants, but there are some of which they are peculiarly fond ; such as, the Echium, Bora go, Verbascum, Serpyllum, and the plants of the class Te tradynamia : they are also fond of the Rhus glabrum and Afclepias syriaca, on which they sit without bumming. In particular countries they attach themselves to particular plants ; for instance, in Sweden and the Highlands of Scot land, to the Erica ; in Scania, to the Buckwheat ; in Poland, to the Limetree ; in Narboime, to the Rosemary ; in Greece, to the Thyme ; in Corsica, to the Arbutus ; in Sardinia, to the Absinthium ; in Pontus, to the Aconitum, &c. and hence arise the different flavour and quality of honey. Bees in the hive generate a considerable quantity of heat, some times equal to that of a fowl in the act of incubation, though a single Bee poss-sles no more watmth than other cold blooded animals. The eggs require heat, and neither mag got nor pupa will live in a heat under 6o\u00b0 or even 700. 7. Apis pi/ipes. Grey; the middle pair of feet with tufts of hair. Inhabits England.

There are several females and individuals of no sex, of two different sizes. Their nest is hid among grafs, and covered with moss, lined within with unwrought wax. It contains one or more combs, composed of oval bodies, placed longitudinally against one another, and which are merely the cells out of which the bees have been bred. They are intermixed with irregular masses of farina, aggluti nated together with a honey substance, which contain the eggs and larv\u00e6, and which serve them at once for food and a habitation.

The males and females only have wings- Alt the species of this genus are of three sorts, males, fe males, and neuters. The males do not enter the nest, but content themselves with fluttring round the Ant-hill, where the females come out to seek them. The neuters alone la bour ; they form the Ant-hill, biing in the provisions, feed the young, bring them to the air during the day, carry them back at night, defend them against attacks, &c. The fe males are retained merely for laying eggs, and, as soon as that is accomplished, they _r_ unmercifully discarded. The males and females perisli with the first cold ; the neuters lie torpid in their nest. In the economy of the Ant, there are many things very remarkable ; the insect is not so useful as the Bee, nor are its manners so wonderful, as its nest does not betray so much art ; but by the diligent observer, the indefatigable industry of this little people ; the zeal with which they gather provi sions and wax, and particularly the exemplary tenderness they display towards their young in the pupa state (general ly, though erroneously considered as their eggs), cannot be viewed without admiration. It has been observed, that a la bouring Ant, whose abdomen had been wantonly cut off, has placed ten of its young in security, before it yielded to its painful death. Our northern species lie torpid in winter, so that they have no occasion for provisions, and accordingly they lay up none But those of the torrid z^ne, which are not thrown into torpidity by cold, must act otherwise, else, in the rainy season particularly, they would starve. Ants furnish a peculiar acid ; they live on garbage, on sweet li quors and fruits ; they abhor fish ; the larva is loft, white, and without feet ; the pupa is motionless, and the favounte food of Nightingales and other Motacill\u00e6.

Wings whitish, with a black fascia in she middle, and two black dots. Inhabits Europe. B. This is a dangerous and often fatal animal to horses. The female, it is said, watches the time when the horse discharges his excrement, and deposits her eggs at the extremity of the rectum. The young larva then makes its way through the gut of the horse (which is eighty-four sett long,) into its stomach; and upon \"\"dissection hundreds have been found there sticking fast to the inner coat by their hooks : some times thev penetrate through the stomach, and gangrene en sues. In general, when their time of change arrives they creep back, through the long dark way by which they en tered, drop upon the ground, and entering the earth turn into a pupa. This is the common opinion ; but it has been with more probability asserted, that the female lays her eggs among the hairs on some part of the horie accessible to his tongue, which, occasioning an itching, are by him licked off, and thus get into the stomach. 3.

Order VII. APTERA. The last' Order consists of such insects as want wings, and never have any ; it contains animals of very various appearance, some of which approach the subject;, of the next class, and make a natural transition to it. Their change is complete (pupa completa), for, from the egg comes the young insect, similar in appearance to the perfect insect ; it changes its skin several times, but varies in nothing except in size and colour. In some, however, as in the Acarus and Scolopendra, new parts are produced, and the Pulex goes through the common transformations. In some, the head forms one piece with the thorax. Some have six feet, others eight, and some have more than one hundred feet- At the mouth some have naked, others covered maxill\u00e6; some want maxill\u00e6 altogether, and others are furnished with a proboscis. The number of eyes is various ; in general, they are simple. In manners, and in food, the Aptera are likewise exceedingly various. Gen. CVII. LEPISMA. Mouth with four palpi, two setaceous, and two capitated ; the lip membrana- ceous, round, and emarginated. Antenn\u00e6 seta- ceous.

Lepifma saccharinum. With silvery scales, and a triple tail. Inhabits America and Europe. B. This insect is a native of America, whence it has been brought to Europe, where it is now common in furniture, books, and cloathes : likewise in damp wainscot and the sashes of windows. The antenn\u00e6 are as long as the body ; the thorax is covered with two scut\u00e6 ; besides the three set\u00e6 at the tail there are two smaller under it. a. Lepifma polypus. Leaps ; the tail triple, the segments of the abdomen villous on both sides underneath. Inhabits Europe. B. Found on sandy shores ; leaping very quickly. Gen. CVIII. PODURA. Mouth with four fub-cla- vated palpi and a bifid lip. Two eyes composed of eight pieces. Tail bifurcated, inflected, and formed for leaping. Six feet formed for running. The insects of this genus, in all their stages, live on the leaves of plants ; they only change tneir skins, not their ap pearance ; the larva and pupa have six feet, and run with agility. s.

Found early in spring on new ploughed land ; this species does not leap. Gen.CIX. TERMES. Mouth with two horny maxill\u00e6; the lip horny and quadrifid ; the lacine\u00e6 linear, acute, and filiform, with four equal palpi. An- tenn\u00e6, in most species, moniliform. Two eyes. The insects of this genus might perhaps be arranged with those of the Neuroptera or Hymenoptera Orders, being re. lated to the first in their larva state, and to the latter as per- fect insects. They consist of males, females, and neuters % the males have wings, but the females and neuters never have any. 1. Termesfatale. The white Ant. Brown above, the thorax with three segments ; the wings pale, the exterior margin testaceous. Inhabits India and Africa. This insect is a most formidable one in the countries it in habits ; it is small, being only about a line and half, or two lines long ; it is eaten with avidity by domestic poultry, birds, and lizards, and even by the native inhabitants. These in sects form a kind of arched roads, about half an inch wide, concave, and flattifh ; these are often built on the floors and ceilings of houses, extending many hundred feet in length, with a variety of serpentine windings. Within these cavi ties the insects live in a well ordered society. In the woods they inhabit large round nests, divided into a variety of cells by"], [292, "278 INSECTS TERMES. by thin intrusted partitions : these nests are many feet in circumference, and contain mlhons of infects. They destroy furniture, vistuals, cloathes, houses, ships, &c. 2. Termes fatidicum. The abdomen ovate, mouth pale ; eyes brown ; antenn\u00e6 setaceous. Inhabits Europe. B. Like the following species, but somewhat larger. 3. Termes pulfatorium. Death-watch. Abdomen ob- long, mouth red, eyes yellow, antenn\u00e6 setaceous. Inhabits Europe. B. A very common insect ; found in old books, old furni- ture, collections of insects, &c. the pupa beats on thin wood with its head, and sometimes with its tail, in a regular man- ner, making a noise like the beat of a watch ; sometimes it beats only seven or eight times, and sometimes for a whole hour without intermission : it appears that the females only beat, whence we may conclude that the operation is connect- ed with the functions exercded by her, and may contribute to the exclusion or proper disposition of the eggs. Gen. CX. PEDICULUS. Louse. Mouth with a retractile recurved haustellum, without proboscis or palpi. Antenn\u00e6 the fame length with the thorax. Two eyes : Abdomen depressed and somewhat lobed. Six feet formed for walking. The insects of this genus are small, and live by sucking the blood md juices of animals. They are perhaps the most universally distributed of all the Clals, as some of them infest the bodies of most quadrupeds and birds ; nay even fishes and other insects are not free from tin -en. i.

Antenn\u00e6 porrected, moniliform, and growing thicker towards the points. Two eyes, the abdomen compressed. Six feet formed for leaping. This genus hath many characters in common with the infects of the Order Hemiptera : it consists but of two spe- cies, which live on the blood of animals ; the larva wants feet, is cylindrical and active, with two cylindrical spines un- der the tail ; the pupa is motionless, and very like the per- fect insect. I. Pulex irritans. Rostrum shorter than the body. Inhabits Europe and America. B. This little animal is sufficiently known, and, less disgust. ing than its fellow blood sucker of the preceeding genus, has sometimes even become a favourite with ladies, who have pleased themselves with keeping, taming, and feeding it. A golden chain has been made for it with a lock and key, and being kept in a box with wool, in a warm place, and fed daily, it has been known to live for six years. Its muscular strength is so great that it can leap 200 times its own length, and drag a weight eight times heavier than itself. Fleas are particularly fond of hares, cats, dogs, &c. but leave them the moment they die, or very soon after. They are expelled by means of Savoury leaves, those of Penny royal, Alder, fee. 2.

This species called by the English in the West Indies, the Chiger, or Jigger, by the French la Chique, fixes itself in the feet, chiefly between the nails and the flesh, and eats its way onwards, depositing its eggs, which are exceedingly minute, in a bag : it is discovered by the uneasy itching it occasions, and must be extracted with great caution and dex terity ; for if the bag is burst, and any of the eggs or ani mals remain, an abscess is often formed which prevents the use of the limb. The slaves who go barefooted, are chiefly exposed to this calamitv. Gen-"], [297, "Aptera* 283 Gen. CXII ACARUS.

The insects of this genus live by preying upon other in- sects, especially those of the Diptera Order, though they do not even spare their own kind ; their dark, insidious, and solitary manners, and the idea that they are poisonous, are no doubt the reason of the common, and almost unconquer- able prejudice that many people entertain against them. Their bite, according to Harvey's experiments, certainly ha\u00bb something venemous in it, and a fly which has once felt it, can never be recovered, but soon dies in convulsions.

The mandible horny and thick ; the lip triple. The insects of this genus have their whole body covered with a hard crust ; in general they live in the sea ; some of them in fresh waters, and some at times come upon land where they live for a month before they return. They seed on other insects, on frogs and small fishes, sometimes on carcases ; the Gammari on aquatic plants. They annually cast their crust, a process which takes time and seems to be attended with pain ; at this time likewise, there are found in the sto mach certain calareous concretions, vulgarly called crabs eyes. They have a power of re-producing their claws and toes when they have been broken off; the female carries her ova under her tail, which for that purpose is much broader than in the male.

Insects are preserved in Cabinets, being stuck through the thorax on pins, the pin fixed in cork or wax. \u00a7 264. In collecting insects, both male and female ought if possible to be procured ; and the time of the year when they are taken ought to be noted. Specimens with in jured wings or antenn\u00e6 must be rejected. For collecting insects in their perfect state, gauze nets are in use, and a sort of forceps, the extremities form ing a circle covered with gauze. Besides these the Entomologist, in his walks, should be furnished with a pincushion, stored with pins of various sizes, and a tin box lined with cork, of a convenient size for the pocket, in which the insects when caught are to be placed ; the lepidopterous insects being firit carefully killed by squeez ing their thorax, lest their fluttering should injure their wings. Coleopterous insects are most expeditioufly killed by being immersed in boiling water ; and those who chuse this method may carry them home without injury in common pill-boxes. Most insects are killed by a sew drops of spirit of turpentine ; the lepidoptera and hymenoptera, may easily be killed by being stuck. through with a pin dipt in aquafortis. When the in sects are killed they are to be transfixed with pins, their wings, antenn\u00e6 and feet spread out and kept displayed. in some of the Lepidoptera, two specimens should be preserved, rhe wings in the one displayed, in the other placed as much as possible, in their natural position when the insect is at rest. Insects may likewise be collected by breeding them from their larv\u00e6 ; and this, when it is convenient, is by far"], [322, "3o8 INSECTS. far the best method for procuring sine specimens ; it is chiefly practised with the lepidopterous kinds. When the caterpillars are taken they are to be fed on the leaves of the plant or tree on which they were found, and kept in a box with some moist earth at the bottom *, they will afterwards turn into a chrysalis, either by going into the earth, by spinning a web and inclosing themselves in it, or by changing into a Pupa obtecla, according to their kinds. Having continued in this state their appointed time, the perfect insect will come forth, and must then be killed before it has injured its wings by flying. Lepidopterous insects are likewise to be collected in their pupa state, by seeking for them under the projec tions of garden-walls, pales, out-houses, summer-houses, &c. or by digging for them in the winter months under the trees they feed on. When thus dug up they are to be put in a box with moist earth and kept till they come out. \u00a7 265. When the insectg are prepared in this manner, they are to be placed in the cabinet, which may consist of boxes or drawers deep enough to hold a long pin, and lined on the bottom with cork, or with wax* ; the in sects of each order in drawers by themselves, and the different genera close together. The generic and trivi al name ot each insect, is to be written on a piece of pa per, fixed to the bottom by the fame pin which sup ports the insect. The drawers must be made to shut very close, so as to exclude the dust and minute insects ; and some coyer them with glass. A little camphor in each drawer is likewise useful. Insects * For large drawers or boxes the following composition is better than Cork. Take ten ounces of yellow rosin ; six ounces of yellow wax ; two ounces of tallow and one ounce of turpentine ; melt these together over a fire, and when they are well melted and mixed, set your box or drawer upon a table or other place which is perfectly horizontal, then pour the mixture gently into the box, so as to cover the bottom about the tenth of an inch.

CHAP,"], [327, "CHAP. VIII; O F HELMINTHOLOGT. \u25a0^_W_}- \u00a7 266. HeLMINTHOLOGY * treats of the Vermes, or of those animals that are furnished with a white and cold sanies, instead of blood ; and whose heart, when they have one, consists but of a ventricle, (Plate I. fig. 6.) They differ from insects in never undergoing any meta morphosis; and, from all other animals, in being able to repair even their essential parts when lost or destroy ed, (\u00a7 46) ; in being, for the most part, either herma phrodites, or destitute of sex ; and, without any visible organs of generation, propagating their offspring. Some of them are oviparous, others viviparous. In some, how ever, such as the Asearis irichiura, and the Cucullanus, a distinction of sex has been observed. In general the Vermes have a much more simple organization than the other animals ; they are destitute of true bones ; but the soft parts of the Asterias and Pennatula, are supported by others of a firmer texture, and many Vermes have a crustaceous covering. Their bodies, in general, can be extended and contracted. But the animals of which this class consists, are very numerous, and they differ much from one another in structure and properties. Vol. II.

A head separated from the trunk by a particular member or neck, is very seldom found in the Vermes. there are, however, instances of it in the genera of Nereis and Nais ; but, on the other hand, if we call that part head, in which the mouth and organs of sense are plac ed, we cannot deny that all the Vermes possess it ; for the whole class take their nourishment by the mouth ; and many of them, as the Hirudo, Nais, Fasciola, Li max, &c. are provided with two eyes, which resemble the stemmata of insects. The Vermes have an organ which is peculiar to them, namely the' feelers, (tentacula), with which most of them are furnished. These are soft and cartilaginous, and are capable of being thrust out and drawn in. Be sides the true feelers, or instead of them, some Vermes have small threads or arms, that are likewise considered as organs of sense or motion ; thus the Hydra and Sepia have cirri, the Vorticella cilia, the Trichoda crines, &c. The number of the tentacula is different. In all the kinds of water Limax there are two tentacula; but in the land species there are four ; in the Nereis, Amphi trite, &c. there are six, or more. In the genera of Umax and Helix, they are filiform ; in the Nereis, setaceous ; feathered (plumosa), in the Amphitrite ; annulated, in the Aphrodita ; branching in the Holothuria ; subulated in the Myxine ; penicil lated in some Echini ; triangular in the Buccinum ; truncated in the Helix Carychium ; pennated in the Serpula ; and crested in the Tubularia. The eyes are placed sometimes in the points of the tentacula, as in the Helix ; sometimes at the base of them on the outside, as in the Bulla ; or on the inside, as in the Buccinum ; in the Sepia they are situated on the sides of the head. The cirrhi are in the Sepia set with warts, (verrucoft), or round, (teretes), as in the Lern\u00e6a ; or broad (dilata ii), as in the Clio ; or concentric, turning in, as in the Hydra 5 or excentiic, turning out, as in the Actinia. \u20225 268."], [329, "HELMINTHOLOGY- 3.5 \u00a7 268. Many Vermes creep or swim in the water without feet ; others have, on the sides of the body, sometimes simple, sometimes branched set\u00e6, that serve them instead of feet. Their abode is generally in fresh or in salt waters ; though a few live on land, but always in moist places ; and some live in the bodies of other aiiirnals. \u00a7 269. If respiration be really necessary to the animals of this class, the function is performed in a manner very different from that in other animals. Their nourishment is simple ; most of them live by suction ; many eat earth, and some of them can sustain a very long fast. \u00a7 27\u00b0- As weapons of defence, some are provided with a poisonous juice ; the Sepia with a kind of ink, and the testacea with a hard shell. \u00a7 271. Their use in the economy of nature is various. The Gordius perforates clay that the water may penetrate through it ; the Lumbricus terrestris the vegetable soil, to keep it porous and friable ; the Teredo perfo rates wood, that it may be destroyed, as the Pho lades and Mytili lithophagi do stones, that they may fall down into dust. Many of them, the Testaeea especially, afford a salu tary and agreeable food to man ; from a species of Mu rex, the famous purple of the antients was obtained ; and from the beard of a species of Pinna, various articles if dress are manufactured in the Levant. Some Mytili produce pearls. Mother of pearl, coral, sponge, &c. aTe all produced by the animals of this class. \u00a7 272. BOOKS ON HELMINTHOLOGY. Intestina, et Mollusca. P. S.

INTESTINA, The Order of Intestina is so called, either because most of the animals it contains, reside in the intestines of other animals, or because they are long and slender, in some degree resembling a gut. They are simple, naked, and without limbs or members. Some live in the bodies of other animals; but a few, such as the Gordius, Hirudo, and Planaria, live in fresh waters ; the Sipunculus and Lumbricus, (except one species), in the sea. Gen- I. ASCARIS. Body long and round, elastic, and attenuated at each end ; the head with three tubercles ; the tail obtuse or subulated. The ves- sels spiral, milk-white, and pellucid. The insects of this genus inhabit solely the intestines of animals : in those of man two species have been found. 1. Ascaris vermicular is. Tail subulated, the skin at the sides of the body very finely crenated. Inhabits the intestines of children, even of those newly- born, especially the rectum *, the animal is viviparous _, it does not exceed an inch in length ; it is thin, white, and so smooth that, even with a glass, no rings are observable in it. It has sometimes been passed with the urine. 2. Ascaris lumbricoides. Tail obtuse, or somewhat in- curved ; the aperture at the tail transverse, the in- testine orange coloured. Inhabits the human intestines, particularly the small ones, sometimes penetrating into the pancreatic duct ; it is easily distinguistied from the common earth worm, for which it is generally taken, by the want of sctse, by the very slen- der rings round it, by its being whitish or reddifli, and by being oviparous. It is also sometimes found in the stomach. Afcarides"], [332, "3i8 VERMES. ASCARIS. Ascarides inhabit the intestines of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, reptiles, and even of the common earth-worm.

TRICHOCEPHALUS- Body elastic, twill- ed ; the posterior part thick and clavated ; the anterior capillary, and double the length of the other ; sometimes with a knob at the end. The animals of this genus are gregarious and oviparous, \u00a31"], [334, "32o VERMES TRICHOCEPHALTJS. and chiefly infest the intestines of man and quadrupeds : the males are distinguished by their tails being spirally rolled up. i. Trichocephalus hominis. Somewhat crenated above, smooth below ; on the fore part finely striated. Inhabits the human intestines. This animal was first discovered in 1760, in the bodies of some French soldiers who died of a contagious disease ; it chiefly resides in the blind gut ; it is about two inches long. Other species are the T. equi, rnurh, vulpis, and lacerta, which are found in the intestines of the Horse, the Mouse, the Fox, and the Lizard. Gen. III. FILARlA. Body round and filiform, equal, very smooth, the mouth dilated ; the lip nearly round and concave. The Filaria differs from the Gordius in its abode, and in its tail not being hooked. It occupies the cellular substance, seldom getting into the intestines -, it has not yet been found in fishes, the amphibia, or reptiles. I. Filaria medinenfts. The Guiney. Entirely of a pale colour. Inhabits Guinea, America, and the Southern parts of Asia. This animal gets into the feet of slaves, and persons who walk barefooted ; exciting pain and fever ; it must be ex tracted gradually and with much caution, for if it breaks, it turns putrid in the wound, and occasions great pain. It is extracted in twenty days by a solution of corrosive sublimate in spirits ; by other means it requires forty days to draw it out. Animals of this genus have been found in some qua drupeds, birds, and insects, but the different species have not been sufficiently described. Gen. IV. UNCINARIA. Body filiform and elastic ; obscurely knobbed before; the lips membranaceous and angulated ; the tail of the female needle-shap- ed ; of the male armed with two pointed hooks inclosed in a pellucid vesicle.

Some of the animals of this genus are long and narrow, others short and broad, and others nearly quadrangular. They are found in man, quadrupeds, birds, reptiles and filli es. They are oviparous, each articulation being filled with an immense number of eggs. They grow sometimes to a con siderable size ; some have been found from 9 to 12 and even to 60 feet long. They are not always fatal ; nor even always the occasion of disease. They are generally gregarious ; from 50 to 100 being found in one animal. * Head armed with a double ring of Jheathed hooks which can be exserted or drawn in. a.

Lumbricus terreftris- The Dew-worm or Earth. worm- Red, with eight lines of prickles. inhitabits the vegetable foil and putrid wood. B. This animal is of great use in the economy of nature, not only furnishing food to half the birds, and \\o some quadru- peds ; but by promoting vegetation, by boring, perforating, and loosening the soil, and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants, by drawing straws, and stalks of leaves, and sticks into it ; and most of all by throwing up such numbers of lumps of earth, called worm-casts, which, being its dung, is a fine manure for grain and grafs. The band, mentioned in the generic character, does not appear in the young, nor in the old except at pairing time. 2.

HIRUDO- Leech. Body oblong, trun- cated behind and before ; without appendages ; cartilagineous, and moves by dilating the mouth and the tail. The animals of this genus are androgynous, though it seems requisite that there should be a junction of two indi viduals. Some species carry their eggs under the belly, e thers lay them on the leaves of aquatic plants, and others are viviparous. Each egg contains many young. The smal ler species have a strong tendency to reproduction, and may be multiplied by cutting. 1. Hirudo mcdicinalis . Common Leech- Elongated and blackish, with lines of different colours on the upper surface, and yellow spots on the under- Inhabits marshes and stagnant waters. B. The Leech is well known as a phlebotomist ; the teeth are three in number, and of a slightly cartilaginous substance, and, being situated so as to converge when the animal bites, leave a somewhat triangular mark on the flein. 2.

B. \u00a7 V5- Order II. MOLLUSCA. The animals of this Order have a soft, gelatinous, naked body, of various figure, and most of them have arms or tentacula ; these serve either for motion, or for bringing the food to their mouth, and they are proba bly organs of sensation; for eyes have been discovered in the Sepia and Limax only, and the head is closely connected with the body. The mouth in some is situ ated above, in some below, and in others at the extremi ty- They are either hermaphrodites, or destitute of sexj in which last case they are multiplied by a natural sepa ration of parts. Most of them live in the sea, some in fresh waters, and the Limax alone on land. Gen. XXII. LIMAX. Naked Snail or Slug. Body oblong and creeping ; with a fleshy shield above, and a longitudinal flat disc below. A foramen on the right side for the genitals and the excrement. Four linear tentacula above the mouth ; eyes in the apex of the greater ones. Slugs are voracious animals, doing much mischief to gar- dens, fields, and meadows ; they are eaten by crows, ducks, and other birds, and quadrupeds. They are hemaphrodites, and fecundate one another. If the head or the tail be cut off,"], [349, "Mollusca. 335 LIMAX. off\", these parts will grow again ; they are able to sustain a fast of a whole year ; they spin a thread, by which they sometimes suspend themselves, or let themselves down from heights. j.

This species is frequently eaten in the southern parts of Europe, especially when full of eggs. It is often taken in dredging, and lodges in the cavities of rocks, just within low water mark. Besides the spines, it has feet or tentacula, which are the organs of its motion, visible only when in the water, as it draws them in when taken out of it. An Echi- nus that has 2000 spines, may have about 1400 of such feet. The spines are of a white or purple colour. 0. Echinus lacunofus. Ovate and gibbous, widi five depressed ambulacra.

Order III. TESTACEA. The Vermes Testacea are animals of a soft gristly substance, covered with a calcareous shell. Most of them are furnished with tentacula, and they do not seem to"], [365, "TESTACEOLOGY. 351 to be of different sexes- In general they are oviparous ; their ova have sometimes a hard shell, sometimes they are soft, and sometimes they form a mass (slavago, me licerisj. A few of the Testacea are viviparous. The shells of these animals are an essential part of them ; they invest the young while yet in the uterus, and grow either by intus-susception, according to some, or by ex ternal apposition, according to others. The colours of shells, some of which are very beautiful, are impressed, not on the external coat, but on the shell itself. Some Univalves have, when they are full grown, an elevated margin ; others have such a margin from the first, and it forms what is called Varix, or Sutura. The Cyprrcas yearly cast their shells, and form new ones to suit their growth. For the most part, the animal inhabitant of all shells, belongs to one or other of the preceding genera of Mol lusca. These animals are possessed of a considerable repro ductive power ; and they can even repair their shells when injured. Many of them serve for food ; some produce pearls ; the Tyrian purple was obtained by the antients from a shell fish ; the byssus of the Pinna, and Mytili, furnished them with their most valuable cloth, and it is still used in the Mediterranean for fabricating gloves, stockings, &c. sittle inferior to some silk. \u00a7 277- The following Books treat particularly of this branch of Natural History.

B. , without any regular spire. \u00a7 279- In bivalves (Concha), the valves (Valvula) are connec- ted together at the hinge, (cardo,) which is considered as the bottom, (bafts), or underside (latus, mat go infe* of the shell, by a ligament (hymen) ; this ligament occupies the anterior chink, (rima anterior, vulva), next to which lies the anterior margin (latus, or margo ante- rior). At the hinder margin of the hinge [latus, or mar- go posterior) there is often a depression (anus). Oppo- site to the hinge is the outer or upper margin, (margo superior), which forms the natural opening of the shell. The eminences (umbones, nates) at the hinge, end in the point of the shell (mucro). The length of the shell if, measured from the hinge to the outer margin, and the breadth from the anterior to the posterior margin. Vol. II. Yy If"], [368, "TESTACEOLOGY. 354 If we place the shell upon the hinge, so that the ante lior side stands forward, the right and left valves are easily known : they are either equally curved on each side of the hinge, (aequilatera), as in the Ostrea ; or ir regularly curved, (inaquilatera ., as in the Veneres ; they are either equally convex, (\u00e6quales), as in the Cham\u00e6 ; or one valve more convex than the other, (inaquales), as in the Spondylus. The outline is called ambitus, the inner margin limbus, and the middle of the outer surface discus. The hipge is either flat, (deprejfus), as in the Mya Vul fella ; as isa part were cut our, (excises), as in the Ano mia truncata ; longitudinal, as in the Area ; bent back, (reftexus), as in the Pholas ; truncated, as in the Anomia truncata f situated at the side, (lateralis), as in the Myti- Jus cygneus ; or at the end, (terminals), as in the Mya Vulfe/la. In general it is furnished with teeth, (dentatus), sometimes not, (edentulus), as in the Mytilus and Pinna. The teeth of the hinge are sometimes compound (dens complicatus), as in the Mactra ; doubled, (duplicatus), as in the Tellina ; recurved, as in the Spondylus ; longitu dinal, as in the Chama. In the hinge there are likewise cavities, (fojfula, foveola, sinus, scrobiculus, &c.) The posterior depression (anus) is lor the most part shut, (clausus), sometimes open, (patu/us, hians), as in the Chama Gigas ; or toothed, as in the Chama Hippo pus, &c. . On the anterior side, we distinguish the margins round the ligament, (labia vulva), which sometimes lie over one another, as in the Venus Dyfera ; the cartilages (nympha) to which the ligament is attached, and by which they are covered ; these stand sometimes distant from each other, (hiantes), as in the Venus meretrix ; or they are funk down, (retracta), as in the Venus Dyfera ; or truncated, as in the Tellina Gari. Round these are sometimes asperities or prickles, (pubes), which are sometimes branched, (ramofa), as in the Venus pectinata. The eminences at the bottom of the shell, (nates, umbo rtes), are sometimes ear-shaped, (auriformes), as in the Chama"], [369, "TESTACEOLOGY. 355 Chama gryphoides ; like horns, (cornifoimcs), as in the Chama bicornis ; bent in, (inftexa, incurva), as in the Cardium Cardisfa ; or bent back, (reftexa), as in the Chama Cor. With respect to the shell in general, in figure and surface, it is either shallow, (compressa), as in the Cardium Cardisfa ; bent down {inftexa), as in the Tellina ; tongue stiaped (linguaeformis), as in the Solen Vulfel/a ; boat-shap ed, (navicularis), as in the Area Noa ; eared, (aurita), as in the Ost eae ; interruptedly striped (antiquata), as in the Cardium edule ; or radiated as in ihe Tellina radiata. \u00a7 280. In the inhabitants of Bivalves there is no distinct head to be observed ; a small round elevation above the mouth is generally tiken for it ; and this is situated in the un der part of the body. They likewise want tentacula. At the mouth they have four membranaceous lips, without maxill\u00e6 or teeth- They have what is called a foot, (pes or suftentaculum), which is sometimes cylindri cal, as in the Solen ; compressed, as in the Tellina ; or sickle-shaped (salcisorme), as in the Cardium . it serves the animal for progressive motion, and even for spring ing, as in the Tellinae. The Ostreae have no foot- At both sides of the foot, or of the body, are two organs re sembling the gills of silhes. They are all oviparous \u2014 See Plate XII. Fig. 8. * Multivalvia. Gen. LH.

The hinge has no teeth, but an ovate cavity, and in most species lateral transverse fulci. No depression or space at the ligament. From tbe similarity in the structure of the hinge, Linn\u00e6us has united the Ostrea and Pecten of Authors in one genus. Some lurk in the sand ; others adhere to rocks, or to the roots of trees on the ssiore. * Radiated and eared. Pectines. Scallops a. Equilateral with equal ears. i. Ostrea maxima. With rounded rays, longitudinally striated. Inhabits the European Seas. B. With about 14 rays, from three to four inches in length, and somewhat more in breadth. The ears are equal, trans versely striated ; the rays and interstices transversely, as well as longitudinally striated, and there are also transverse concen tric wrinkles, which become stronger towards the margin. These shells were formerly used by Pilgrims as a badge, and were worn in their hat, or on their clojk. In the western islands, the shallow valves were antiently used at feasts for plates, and the hollow ones for drinking cups, to which use these last are still applied. a. Ostrea Jacobaea. With 14 angulated rays ; longitu- dinally striated. Inhabits the Mediterranean. B. The rays of the ssiallow valve are rounded, and transverse ly, net longitudinally striated ; the ears are-smooth ; it is not common. 3. Ohreaftnuofa. Ovate ; very thickly and finely stri- ated ; the inner margin crenated. Inhabits the British sea. Fou"], [390, "376 VERMES. OSTREA.

Thick and strong ; about an inch and a half long, and somewhat less in breadth ; very irregular, distorted, and seemingly hurt by accident. It varies in colour. It is the Pecten distortus of Da Costa, but is perhaps the fame shell with thestnuo/a above. 7. Ostrea glabra. With equal valves, and ten smooth and flattiih rays ; the inside stri\u00e6 raised and doub- led. Inhabits the Adriatic. B. Given from Pennant as the glabra Lin. Found in Angle sea. This British species is said to have fifteen rays and equal ears, and to be a small species ; in which circumstances it differs from the glabra. 3. Ostrea opercularis. With twenty rays, which are rounded, and rough, with decussated stri\u00e6. Inhabits the Adriatic and Northern seas. B. About two inches and a quarter in length, the breadth nearly the fame. Both valves are in some degree convex, but not equally so ; one ear is rectangular, the other curved ; on the more convex valve, the longitudinal strhc are fewer, but"], [391, "Testacea. 377 OSTREA. but more distinct than in the other. In Scotland, where the animal is frequently eaten, it is called the Clam. It is the subrufus of Pennant. -9* Ostrea lineata.

Ostrea edulis. Common Oyster. Semi-orbicular; imbricated with waving flakes; one of the valves flat and intire. Inhabits the European and Indian Ocean. B. Well known, and much esteemed as food, and bred in such quantities as to make a considerable article of trade. The British Oysters were famous even in the time of the Romans ; and those of Richborough, the antient Rutupi num, were considered as the best. They grow in beds ar the bottom of the sta, generally in bays, on a substance which has the technical name of cultch; on this they deposit their spawn, and when full grown they are dredged up. They are in season, according to the vulgar account, in those month? which have the letter r in their name ; that is from Septem ber to April inclusive. A green colour is artificially given to them in some places, but, as this is unnatural and a diseases Vol. IT. Bbb ths;"], [392, "378 VERMES.

About an inch and a half in dia- meter, but commonly less. Shell thick and strong. Inside of a livid green colour *, outside uneven, but not rugged, with longitudinal ridges. The shells are found on nuny parts of the British shores, but mostly the concave valve. Gen. LXVI. ANOMIA. The animal various. Shell with unequal valves ; one flattish, the other gib- bous at the base, and one of them also generally perforated at the base. Hinge formed by a linear prominence and a lateral tooth within, which, in the flat valve, is inserted in the margin. Two boney rays serving as a support to the animal. The animals of this genus adhere to fuci, or to other ssiells \u2022at the bottom of the sea. Several species are found fossil in Britain. 1. Anomia Ephippium. Nearly orbicular, with wrink- led plaits ; the flat valve perforated. Inhabits the Indian and American oceans. B. About an inch and a half in diameter or more, adhering to other ssiells, particularly Oysters, which it likewise resem- bles in habit ; but is thin, fragile, and of a pearly substance. 2. Anomia Cepa. Obovate, unequal, and of a violet colour ; the upper valve convex, the under one perforated. \u25a0 Inhabits the Atlantic, American, cVc. Oceans. B. Perhaps but a variety of the former ; it is less, and varies in figure and colour ; it is sometimes purple, yellow, or rose- coloured ; the inside like mother of pearl. It is not so com- mon as the other. 3. Anomia Squamula. Orbicular, intire, and flat ; on one margin gibbous and smooth. Inhabits the Northern Ocean. B. A small species like the scale of a fish, adhering to muscles, oysters,"], [393, "TesTace.v 379 ANOMIA. oysters, &c. When old, it is frequently marked with three or four deep-coloured longitudinal stripes. Gen. LXVIl. MYTILUS. The animal an Ascidia. Shell coarse ; generally attached by a byssus, which, for the most part, is gross. The hinge in most species wants teeth, distinguished, except in a few, by a su- bulated longitudinal furrow. The Mytili either adhere to rocks by their byssus, or to the Gorgoni\u00e6 by a sort of claws ; or they penetrate calcareous rocks, where they reside without changing place. Some of them, which adh.re to rocks near the ssiore, are taken by fisliermen either for food or bait ; and men, trained for that purpose, dive to the bottom of the deep sea, in order to bring up such as produce pearls. Of these the antient Romans were extravagantly fond. \" It is not enough, fays Pliny, to despoil the sea of its riches in order to gorge our appetites, we must likewise, both men and women, carry them about on our hands, in our ears, upon our head, and on our whole body.\" i. Mytilus rugtsus. Rhomb-shaped, oval, wrinkled, ob- tuse and antiquated- Inhabits the Norwegian seas. B. A small species, thick, strong, and opake ; about an inch in breadth, and half an inch long ; of a dirty white colour. 2. Mytilus barhatus. Somewhat smooth, ferrugineous. and bearded on the outside at the apex. Inhabits the Mediterranean and Norwegian Seas. B. Half of the shell, towards the apex, is covered with a brown epidermis, and beset with a close beard, which seems to be adventitious, as it is sometimes wanting , perhaps this species is but the young of the Modlolus.

A large, thick, and heavy shell, six inches long, three broad ; the largest of the British muscles. On the outside blackissi, within sometimes very finely coloured. It inhabits deep water, fixes on the fissiermens bait, and is drawn up with the lines, but is seldom thrown on ssiore. 7. Mytilus umbilicatus. Oval, the space opposite to the hinge deeply inflected or umbilicated. Inhabits England.

Oval, horny, fubdiaphanous ; on the anterior fide longitudinally, and on the posteri- or transversely striated. Inhabits the Northern and Southern ocean. B. Ofthesizeofa kidney bean, thin, and brittle, os a light greenissi colour, with a faint tint of brown, or rosy ; the valves very conc.ve, longitudinally divided into three are_,s or compartments. Gen. LXVI1I. PINNA. The animal a Limax. Sub- bivalve, brittle, erect and gaping, with a silky beard- Hinge without teeth, the valves adhering on the one side. The Pinn\u00e6 sometimes grow to a large size, and stand erect in the sand or mud in deep water ; they likewise fix themselves to the rocks by their byssus, and thus are not af- fected by the agitation of the waves. 1, Pinna pectinata. One half longitudinally striated, the other side transversely wrinkled. Inhabits the Indian Ocean. B. Six inches long by three wide, very thin and fragile, of an horn colour, but at the base varying and slightly coloured. Ten or eleven ribs run diverging from the apex, for two thirds of its width from the hinge side ; each rib set with concave prickles, the remaining part destitute of ribs, but wrinkled in a direction obliquely transverse with respect to the ribs. Found at Weymouth. Pulteney. 2. Pinna muricata. Striated, with concave, ovate, acute scales. Inhabits the Indian Ocean. B. About five or six inches long, and two or three wide ; of an horn colour, tinged with a faint flesh-coloured hue, 10 or 1 2 irregular longitudinal ribs, with concave prickles. Besides these two, a very large species was found by Dr. Walker off the island of Barra jn 1764, called by him the Pinna borealis. \u00a7 277-"], [396, "382 VERMES \u00a7 288. The Cochleae or Univalve shells, except perhaps the Paper Nautilus, (Argonauta), grow with their fliell ; ac cordingly the structure of the shell depends on the form of the animal, and the various surfaces of shells on the situation of the pores in its skin. The sliells of Univalves are sometimes without any spire, as in the Patella ; or the wreaths (anfractus), are irregular, as in the Serpula, but in geneial they are re gular. These are so turned that when the extremity of the spire or apex is made to point downwards, the wreaths revolve according to the motion of the fun (an fractus fecund!) ; or if the Cochlea is laid on the opening or mouth towards the observer, the wreaths rife from the left to the right hand, and the shells are then called Cochlea dextra ; but in some instances, the wieaths pro ceed in a contrary direction, and the shells are then call ed Cochleae Jiniftrae, and the wreaths anfractus con irarii. The Columella, about which the wreaths revolve, pro ceeds through the middle of the shell. The beginning of the Columella and of the spire make the apex or mu cro ; and the end (bafts), is at the mouth or opening (aperturd); this is sometimes continued out into a fort of process called cauda, which in general is channelled or furnished with a gutter (canalis). The end of the wreaths is called the outer lip (labium dextrum, exterius, or la btuni) ; and the inner lip (labium interius,siniftrum), covers the columella. Near this is often placed a perforation called (umbilicus). The wreaths are connected together by sutures (futurae). The uppermost wreaths taken to gether are called the spire (Jpira). The last, and gene rally the largest wreath, is called the body or belly of the shell (corpus, venter), and the upper side of it the back (dorfum). 1 he inner cavity ot the shell is filled with the animal, and in all the univalves is simple. But in the genus Nautilus there are many chambers lying behind one another (testa polythalamia), in which the animal lives. These chambers are penetrated by a cy- lyndrical"], [397, "Testacea. 383 lyndrical opening (fipho), sometimes in the middle, sometimes at one side, and, externally the shell often appears articulated at the partitions. The fore part of the shell (testa antica), according to Linn\u00e6us, is that part which Hes next the wreaths, and that in the neighbourhood of the mouth or opening he calls the hind part or base rpostica, bafts). \u00a7 282. Upon the head of the animal inhabitant there are either two or four feelers, or tentacula. Those that have four are land animals. All water Cochle\u00e6 have but two tentacula. Many of the land species can live a long time in water ; but the aquatic species die in a short time on dryland. The land Cochle\u00e6 draw in their tentacula very readi ly ; those of the water do net; but they can (Iretch them out, bend them at the points, incline them down wards, or lay them close upon the body. They are cer tainly organs of a fense unknown to us. The situation of the eyes is various. At the mouth they have sometimes maxillae ; some times, particularly the sea Cochleae, a proboscis. Their food consists of plants and of water which is filled with the infusory animalcula. They can endure hunger for a long time. On the body is to be seen what is called the foot, on which the animal, with a particular undulatory motion, creeps and swims. At this place is 'likewise formed the operculum, by which the animal shuts itself up in the shell, and which in some, as in the Trochi, is horny or cartilaginous, and in others, as the Turbines, testaceous. The land Snails close their shells in winter with an operculum formed of then* indurated slime. (Plate XII, fig. 6). * XJn'tvalvia. A. With a regular spire. Cochleae. Gen. LXIX- ARGONAUTA.

The paper Nautilus. The carina of the shell subdentated on both sides. Inhabits the Indian and Mediterranean Seas. This elegant shell is inhabited by an animal resembling the Sepia octopodia. In calm weather it rises to the surface, and spreads out its arms over the shell, which serves it for oars, and raising and expanding a double membrane of wonderful tenuity, as a fail, it glides along with the breeze. When danger threatens it suddenly withdraws into the shell, and finks to the bottom. Some maintain that the animal is not attached to the shell, but can quit it when there is no other mode of escape. It is often taken by fissiermen among Sepire, \u2022near the rocks on the shore, and sometimes it enters their nets. Gen. LXX NAUTILUS- The animal a Shell divided into compartments by perforated par- titions. Of this genus there is no Britissi species. i. Nautilus Pompilius. With a heart-shaped aperture, the wreaths obtuse and smooth. Inhabits the Indian and African oceans. This species is frequent in collections ; it is larue and solid, covered with a white crust, under which it is beautifully marked with brown spots, and waving stri\u00e6 ; it is therefore often decorticated, and used for drinking cups in the East. A specimen of the Nautilus^*'*-///., was given to the Editor, as found in Abcrlady Bay, about twelve miles east of Edin burgh. This however was most probably accidental. Gen . LXXI.

In general they are found on rocky shores. i. Conus marmoreus. Conical, and brown, with ovate white spots ; the wreaths of the spire channelled. Inhabits Asia. A beautiful species, of which there are several varieties, not uncommon in collections ; the spots are large and distinct. 2. Conus Ammiralis. The Admiral. Rough at the base, with dots. Inhabits the ssiores of South America. This is one of those ssiells for which collectors give a great price. One hundred Guineas have been oflered for that va riety of it known by the name of Cedo nulli. Very few per fect specimens are known, and these are only in the first-rate cabinets. Gen. LXXII. CYPRAEA. The animal a Limax. Shell involuted, sub-ovate, obtuse and smooth. Ap- erture open at both ends, linear, dentated on both sides, and extending the whole length of the shell. This is likewise a very numerous genus, consisting of beau- tiful, polissied and coloured shells, of which only one is a na- tive of Britain. They live in the sand at the bottom of the sea, and are provided with a membrane which they can throw over their ssiells, and thus preserve them always pure and polissied. They annually leave their ssiells to form a new and larger one. 1. Cypraea Tigris. Ovate, obtuse behind, rounded be- fore, with a testaceous longitudinal line. Inhabits the Indian and Adriatic seas. One of the most common of the genus in collections, and one of the prettiest. It is of a ferruginous, yellowissi, or bluish colour, with numerous spots, frequently running into one another ; whitissi at the sides and underneath, with an oblique line along the back. 2.

Aper- ture nearly close at the ends, oblong, the length of the shell, entire at the base. The columella oblique and smooth. The species of this genus are all of a swollen bubble-like appearance, whence the name. The animal is too large for the shell, and cannot contract itself so as to retire wholly within it. Some inhabit the sea, and are immersed in the sand, an inch or two deep ; others are found in fresh running or stagnant waters. 1 . Bulla aperta. Roundish, pellucid, transversely striat- ed, quite open. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope. B.

This is one of those ssiells called mitres, which are much valued by collectors. It is whitissi, with numerous spots of a deep or brownissi red colour, and, when recent, covered with a thin epidermis. The animal is said to be of a poisonous na ture, and to wound those who touch it with a kind of point ed trunk. Gen. LXXV, BUCCINUM.

The aperture closed at the ends, lunated within, or circular, but a segment of the circle as it were cut off. The animals of this genus are all either inhabitants of the land or of fressi waters ; they feed on vegetables, but can sustain a fast altogether incredible ; some, it is said, having revived after being 14 or 15 years in a state of torpidity. They are possessed of a very considerable degree of reproduc tive power, and are capable of regenerating even the head. Their amours are conducted in a very extraordinary manner : in the breeding season they are provided with a number of ssiarp, horny, and delicately formed fpicula, lodged in a cavi ty of the neck, and which opens externally on the right side. Upon the approach as two snails about the end of May or beginning of June, a singular combat, perhaps by way of pre liminary dalliance, takes place, and for some time they dis charge these fpicula against each other. By degrees they ad vance, their ammunition being expended, they terminate their amorous quarrel, and an union succeeds. They deposit their eggs under some clod, or in some small ssieltered cavity, where the young are hatched completely formed. * Carinated, the margin of the wreaths acute. 1, Helix Lapicida- Umbilicated, and convex on both, sides ; the aperture transverse, marginated, and ovate.

The animals of this Order are called animal plants, sZoophyta), because, though they resemble plants in their external structure, they are true animals, as they possess sensation and voluntary motion, and take their food"], [425, "ZOOPHYTA. 411 food by means of external members. They include all those bodies called Corals and Corallines, Polypi, &c. They are all inhabitants of the sea ; and their soft carti laginous parts, which are the organs of their fenses and motions, dry in a short time after they are taken out of their proper element, so that in Cabinets we can only preserve their hard parts. These firm parts are in gene ral external, and form certain hollows or cells. In some, as the Isis, Gorgonia, &c. the hard parts are internal, and we can separate the cortical part from the woody substance. These firm parts are either calcareous, or horny (keratophyta), or fungous. No particular intes tines or organs of generation can be observed in the Zoophyta, but they increase either by ova which they generate on particular places of them, as in the Sertu- lari\u00e6 ; or the young spring out of their substance, as in the Hydr\u00e6. The resemblance of these Plant-animals to vegetables .consists in this, that from the egg is formed a bulb, which shoots up into a stem, and fends off branches : there is also a root, which however is merely the organ of attachment, affording no nouriihment to the animals, which are furnished with arms as so many mouths, 01* rather limbs, to convey the food to the mouth : these members only are capable of voluntary motion, for the entire body is immoveably fixed by the root, (ftirps ra dicatd) ; some of them, however, are capable of chang ing place, as the Pennatula, (stirps vaga). Formerly Imperati and Gefner had remarked the ani mal structure of Corals ; but, in modern times, Peysonell was the first who discovered the living animals, and hh discoveries have been confirmed by Reaumur, Jusiieu, Tremhley, Donati, Ellis, Baster, Pallas, and Linn\u00e6us.

Order V. INFUSORIA The Infusory animals make the last Order of this Class, and consequently the last division of the Animal Kingdom ; they are found in water, or in the infusions made with vegetable or animal matters- Most of them are invisible to the naked eye, or appear but as mov ing atoms ; but by the help of a magnifier, we can fully satisfy"], [450, "436 VERMES, satisfy ourselves that they are animals ; for different kinds have different motions ; some move quickly, some slowly ; some in a circle, some in a serpentine, and some in a straight line ; they avoid one another, and instantly fly the moment they observe an enemy, or any thing dangerous. Their motions seem all to be volun:ary ; they change their shape, often in the space of a minute. In some the motion of the heart and of the intestines can be discerned. When the drop of water in which they are examined begins to dry up, they crowd away from the margins to the centre, or to that side where most water remains ; their organs move quicker in pro\" portion as it dries up, they seem to be in agony, and die as soon as it is evaporated. \u00a7 2\u00a75- Most of the infusory animals are pellucid, so that we can examine their internal structure. Many of them possess no external organs, and appear like a transparent moving membrane, filled with little bladders, some times thin, sometimes thicker, and of various figure ; but others have a sort of tail, and are beset with longer or shorter hairs. The food of these animals appears to be solely water, and those vegetable and animal matters which are dissol ved in it. Their period of life is various. Some live but a few days, others weeks, or months, in water which is not changed, but which does not corrupt ; and when infusions are made some appear early, and others not for weeks. Some cast their skins, without suffering any other change. Some are very tenacious of life, withstanding the heat of almost boiling water, others surviving the cold of 320. The most of them swim freely in the water, others attach themselves to the a quatic testacea or infects. With respect to their generation, some propagate them selves by ova, as the Trichoda Lepus ; others are vivipa- rous."], [451, "Infusoria. 437 rous, as the Volvox Globator ; in others, the young grow like buds or bulbs out of the body of the parent, as the Vorticella; and some increase by the spontaneous division of their body into two parts, which is either longitudi nal, as in the Paramaecium and Cyclidium ; or trans verse, as in the Monas and Trichoda. The Vorticella. increase in all these ways. It is probable that, at certain seasons, they are all oviparous , and, that their ova, be ing inconceivably minute, are carried up into the atmos phere by the constant evaporation of water from the sur face of the globe, where they are dispersed, and float in it, and perhaps are as continually deposited again, those only being evolved which find a proper nidus, such a> animal or vegetable infusions, putrid water, &c. accord ing to their nature. \u00a7 286.
