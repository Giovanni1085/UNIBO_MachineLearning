By James Hardiman, Esq., M. R. I. A. Read February 27, 1826. JL HE abolition of the ancient tenures of Ireland, and the conse quent deduction of title from the crown of England, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rendered deeds and writings in the Irish language, particularly those relating to landed pro perty, in a great degree useless. Other combining circumstances, but chiefly the policy and care of successive English grantees to destroy all evidence of previous right and possession in the natives, caused those domestic documents to become so scarce, that the few which escaped the general wreck are, at the present day, esteemed valuable rarities, when to be found in the cabinets of the curious. In fact so rare did they becom ;, that Mr. O'Halloran, in the Introduction to his History of Ireland, has given a transla tion, accompanied by an elaborate description, of a single Irish deed, which he notices as a matter of great curiosity, though not much older than the beginning of the fourteenth century. This is a loss much to be regretted, but particularly so in an historical point of view ; for, next to the publication of the remains of the Brehon law, the written instruments in use under that code would serve to convey more accurate information of the state of society in Ire land, and of the manners, customs and ordinary transactions of the b 2"], [16, "4 people, than perhaps any other medium at present extant, the printed histories and unpublished annals of the country being in those respects lamentably deficient. This position will appear clearly exemplified by the ancient Irish writings, which I now have the honor of laying before the Academy in their original form, accompanied with close English translations.* This collection principally consists of deeds and instruments relating to property, and almost entirely belongs to that part of Ireland, anciently called Tuath-Mumhain, (Thomond ) or North Munster. This great territory, which was formerly under the dominion of the powerful family of O'Brien, extended from the Isles of Aran, on the western coast of the kingdom, to Sliabh- Eibline near Cashel in the present county of Tipperary, thence to Carran-Fearaidh or Cnoc-Aine in the present county of Limerick* and from Leim-na-con or Loopshead to Sliabh-Dala in Ossory. Part of this tract of country was erected into a county, in the year 1585, by Sir John Perrott, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and received the name \" Clare,\" in commemoration of the Anglo-Norman Earl,-f * To William Dix, Esq. an eminent Solicitor of this city, I am indebted for many of these documents. William Shaw Masorij Esq., author of the Statistical Survey of Ireland, kindly furnished me with a few from his valuable MS. collection. The remainder were in my own possession. It has been suggested that many of a similar nature might be discovered in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, if carefully explored. f By inquisition taken at Castlebank in the County of Clare, on the 23d of August, 1637, it was found, that Edward I. by letters patent dated 26th January, 1275, granted the whole land of Thomond to Thomas De Clare, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, who died thereof seized at Bunratty in 1287 ; that said land descended to Gilbert De Clare his son and heir, who having died without issue, it descended to Richard De Clare his brother, who having died in 1317, the land of Thomond, for want of heirs male of the original grantee, re verted to the crown ; and that at the time of taking the inquisition the fee and inheritance thereof were vested in King Charles I. \u2014 Orig.

These belong to the 12th, 13th and 14th cen turies. The greater number, however, are dated. The earliest of the latter class occurs in the year 1419, and the latest in the year 1619, about which time the use of the Irish language in legal writings was discontinued. The deed, No. II. which I conjecture to be as early as the beginning of the 12th century, is a curious specimen of its kind. Of it and No. XXIX. which is dated in the year 1573, sac-similes are given. The rudeness of the one, and the comparative elegance of the other, will shew the improve ment which took place in the art of penmanship between both periods. Their contents are strikingly interesting at the present day, being illustrative of manners and customs, which have long since disap peared and been forgotten. Like all collections, some of the pre sent articles, taken singly, may be esteemed of little or no value, but combined, their utility becomes obvious and unquestionable. They mutually serve to explain each other, and by so doing deve lope facts which, otherwise, might have remained buried in obli vion. To adduce a few instances. They evince the characteristic piety of the people, who often commenced and concluded these instruments with some word or expression of a pious tendency, and consecrated their ordinary dealings with the solemnity of religion, by frequently calling on God as a witness to their contracts.* They also shew the state of education, for I was not a little surprised to find so few marksmen, as they are termed, among so many origi- * See Nos. XX \u2014 XXI. \u2014 In No. XXV. God with his angels are named as sureties, that the rival chieftains O'Brien and Macnamara would not wage war against each other."], [19, "7 nal signatures. But here it must be observed, that the district of Thomond, or Clare, like that of Kerry, has been from an early pe riod, and still is, remarkable for the generally improved education of the various classes of its inhabitants. Further, they afford abundant evidence that the Irish natives of those parts acknow ledged no other legal jurisdiction than that of the Brehons, un til after the commencement of the seventeenth century, when the laws of England, under James the first, were extended over the whole island, and legal muniments were, for the first time, gene rally written in the English language. The following instruments, combined with the fragments of the Brehon code, published by the late venerable and learned Vallancey, even scanty and imperfect as they are, will demonstrate how long and how stedfastly the people adhered to those laws, which were established in Ireland before the era of Christianity, and continued to the accession of a monarch, to whom the nation willingly submitted, as the lineal descendant of its ancient kings. Among the most curious may be enumerated No VIII. being an ancient translation of a Brehon Judge's sentence or decree, a record of very rare occurrence. The punishment appears to have been by Eric or Fine, for as murder was punished by an Eric, so a bare attempt to commit it, as in the present case, though unsuc cessful, was also subject to a like penalty.* From this fragment it is manifest, notwithstanding some assertions to the contrary, that the decrees of the Brehons were committed, in regular legal form, to writing. It further shews that they were accustomed to insert in * Vide Harris's Ware, where an instance is adduced under the year 1148, that \" When Do nald O'Ferral and several of his clan conspired to kill Ternan O'Rorke, whom they set upon and grievously wounded ; yet, notwithstanding he escaped with life, his Eric was exacted from the O'Ferrals, as if he had been killed.\"\u2014 Fy.. 1 . p. 70."], [20, "8 their judgments the terms of the laws on which they founded their decisions. In the present instance such was the case, but the Irish original has not been handed down, and the words of the law are dismissed by an #c. in this old translation. \u2014 Numbers XIV. and XV. present a singular view of the possessions of the O'Brien and Macnamara families, near five centuries ago. Number XXV. might, with propriety, be termed Articles of Peace, between the Rival Chieftains of those names. Number XXIX. and the note subjoined to it are amongst the most interesting of the entire. The reader cannot but be struck by the expression in the latter, \" Prostrate upon my knees before your honors,\" as displaying an incident which, it is conceived, would form an appropriate subject for an historical picture, whose leading feature might be the striking contrast be tween the humiliated Milesian prince on the one side, and the arrogant members of Queen Elizabeth's Irish Privy Council of that day on the other. But the principal value of investigations like the present lies in the assistance which they afford the local or general historian, in tracing the progress of society, and illustrating the manners and customs of former times. The ancient writings now under consider ation, may prove serviceable in these respects. So far as they extend, they shew the use and denomination of money, the value of land and its produce, and the price of several commodities from time to time, for some centuries. From among the matters of various in formation which they contain the following heads have been selected. \u2014 In No. X. a fine or Eric appears to have been imposed for murder or homicide, but very inadequate in amount to the dreadful crime committed. Although murder was generally punished by fine, as before observed, yet it must not be concluded that that was the only penalty. This and other heinous offences were punish-"], [21, "9 able with death by the ancient laws of Ireland. This severity was, however, in general mitigated by the law of Eric or retaliation, to which some historians have given a decided preference over the more sanguinary inflictions of modern times. \u2014 From No. II. it may be inferred that title to lands might have been acquired by force, or in consequence of forfeiture as an Eric. Conor O'Hurley appears to have so acquired the land of Carrowancalla. To Galloglasses he paid sixteen cows and a noble for the Brehon's judgment, by which the transaction was affirmed. \u2014 The consent of the entire tribe or family necessary before an individual could alienate any part of the inheritance, XIX. \u2014 One tribe purchasing land from another becomes bound to furnish, as additional consideration, suitable food and raiment, for a certain period of time, and the disposing party is bound to be clement, or to afford protection to the other, XVIII. \u2014 Cattle given as a marriage portion, XXVI. \u2014 Cattle taken as a prey and the owners made prisoners, VIII. \u2014 A whole town land forfeited for stealing a cow.

It must be obvious to all capable of considering the subject with attention, that much preliminary labour yet remains to be achieved, before a comprehensive History of Ireland can be fully and faith fully given to the world. When this desirable and much wished for work shall be completed, the Irish character will beam forth in all its native brilliancy from beneath the dark clouds of prejudice and misrepresentation, which have obscured it for centuries. Such a his tory will moreover be an awful warning to present and future gene rations, to avoid these internal dissentions, which at all times, even to the present day, have proved the principal impediment to the happiness and prosperity of the country.\u2014 Bede and others, at an early period, described Ireland as supereminently blessed with the choicest gifts of nature, as an Island flowing with milk and honey."], [23, "11 Had this venerable historian lived at a later period, he would see those boasted gifts of nature trampled under the foot of the hostile invader. Instead of milk and honey, he would have described Ireland as an Island flowing with blood, and plunged in all the horrors of almost continuous civil warfare and confusion. Tranquillity was for ages a stranger in the land, except for those few gloomy and transient intervals, which in general but preceded more dreadful storms. Yet even during these short cessations of war, the native character some times appeared, the cheering sounds of peace were heard, the shuttle and the plough were seen to move, and numerous flocks and herds covered its hills and plains. The art of agriculture too, but with frequent interruptions, flourished in many parts of the kingdom, to a degree that drew forth reluctant praises from those very men, whose policy and interest it was to misrepresent the country. The people of the west, remote from the calamities in which the other quarters of the island were generally involved, retained to a late period many of the simple primeval customs of rural and even of pastoral life, as the instruments before us in many instances tes tify. Amongst them, debts were contracted and paid in living money,* lands were given in mortgage or exchange for cows, horses, sheep, &c. and tributes and rents were rendered in cattle or in ounces of gold and silver. In reviewing the manners and state of society in former times, care must be taken not to draw hasty conclusions from the present advanced position of human cultiva tion.-f- The improvement of man is ever progressive, and in Ireland, * Mr. Henry, in his valuable History of England, states, that living money, which was so general in England before the Norman conquest, is not mentioned by writers after that event. \u2014 Vol. III. p. 510. \u2014 It appears to have been in use to a much later period in Ireland. f In England, in the days of Edward I., and even so late as those of Henry VI., we know c2"], [24, "12 notwithstanding the exaggerated allegations of prejudice, and the many obstacles which the people had to contend with, it is certain that they were not more backward in civilization than those of most of the other nations of Europe. The testimony of that distinguished Chief Justice of England, Lord Coke, concerning the Irish people, remains recorded in his Institutes, a triumphant refutal of previous and subsequent misrepresentation. \" I have been informed,\" says this great and good man, \" by many of them that have had judicial places there, and partly of mine own knowledge, that there is no nation of the Christian world that are greater lovers of justice than they (the Irish) are, which virtue must of necessity be accompanied by many others.\" \u2014 Can it be supposed that a declaration of this kind would be made, and that by such a man, if the Irish people were really what they had been represented by his country men and cotemporaries ? But his is not the only testimony. Sir John Davis uses even stronger language, to the same effect. Every remnant therefore which tends to illustrate the manners and cus toms of such a people must be interesting and valuable, not alone in a national point of view, but as a leading feature in the history of mankind. These are the considerations which induced me to undertake the task of preparing these ancient fragments for inspection, and to deposit my humble mite in the treasury of public information. that ,\u00a3 10 or _\u00a320 a year were considered a competent estate for a gentleman.

In 1476 Counsel's fees were lower than in our times. In the account of the church-warden of St. Margaret, Westminster, we find, \" Roger Fylpot, learned in the law, paid for his opinion given Ss. 8d. with 4rf. for his dinner.\" In 1493 Sir William Drury, one of the richest men in Suffolk, bequeathed fifty marks to each of his daughters. \u2014 The value of money then was about twenty four times more than at the present day. \u2014 See Henry's valuable History of England, whose ex cellent plan will yet, it is hoped, be extended to Ireland. \u2014 See also Fleetwood's Chronicon Preciosum."], [25, "13 To those literary friends who have kindly favoured me with their opinions on these documents I feel indebted, particularly to John D' Alton, Esq.

In the last year of this Prince's reign, which was in 1496, he fought an obstinate battle against Gerald Fitzgerald Earl of Kildare, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, near the castle of Bally-Hicky, which that Earl took soon after by assault, together with the castle of Fiadh-Bog and other Castles in Thomond, belonging to Florence Mac Namara. See the annals of Sir James Ware at this year. This prince died in the same year 1496, and left posterity who were called the O'Briens of Sealuidhe in the county of Clare.

The son of the Madra dun* stole a cow from Fergus Mac Conor Mac Maelseachlan, and brought her to Bally beghan unto Lewis, and for this act he forfeited that Townland, in satisfaction for that cow, and also fourteen cows mulct were imposed upon him, and through these said possession accrued. These are the persons unto whom he (Lewis) gave these cows, viz. 20*. unto Teige Mac Phelim O'Connor, a mark unto Teige oge Mac Teige O'Connor, a mark unto Teige oge Mac Teige O'Daly, and \u00a3 a mark unto Mora O'Donnellan. Seven cowes were to be taken from said Lewis in payment of that \\ mark, and it was clue only a year, and he was even to pay that \\ mark at the expiration of a year unto Mora. The witnesses that these 7 cows were paid in satisfaction of that \\ mark are the children of Eugene O'Conry and John Mac Casey, and the Dowde family. The last will and testament of Lewis O'Loghlan at his death, concerning Ballybeghan was that Ballybeghan was not subject to any debts, not so much as one penny, at the time of his death.

The Irish were profusely li. beral of Nicknames. Every defect of body or mind, moral or physical, supplied these derisive appellations. \u2014 See Ware Antiq. Vol. I. p. 58."], [43, "31 will are these, viz. the Abbot O'Brody, John O'Tierny, Maurice O'Minan and Torlogh Duffe the priest. These are the aliena tions of Mahon Ballagh unto the children of Maurice O'Brien, viz. Murogh O'Brien was to go to Ballybeghan, and to take it from him again ; and Turlogh O'Brien was to go to Bally beghan, and to permit him (i. e. Murogh) to enter and dress food there,* and take possession of the townland from Turlogh, and to keep same to himself, and that they should have neither right, title nor covenant to said townland, except what they ac quired by these entries, against the will of the inhabitants of the same. Further 4 in-calf cows belonging to Mahon were killed by the people of Teige O'Brien in Ballybeghan, the night that Dermot O'Brien came there. Furthermore an ounce of gold and 13 marks mulct taken from O'Loghlan for killing the wife of Mahon Ballagh and their servants, and the value of 15 marks of cattle to be taken from him, by virtue of the covenant entered into between Donat O'Brien and O'Loghlan respecting Ballybeghan. Dermot Oge O'Neallan wrote that contract. More, milch cows and a flock of sheep to be given to Ross O'Loghlan by him in like manner. More, to give 18 litters of swine and 13 goats and a cow in-calf to the children of Donald Mac Gill Christ, Coineabha Mac Gorman and Donald oge O'Tevin. \u2014 Furthermore, Mahon Ballagh and Ross Mac Donagh going to Dublin, with Donat O'Brien, when Murogh O'Brien came to obtain a letter under the Lord Justice's hand, for Donogh O'Brien to enter Bally beghan, as witnessed by the two Mac Namaras and Master Neal lan and O'Griffa. \u2014 Furthermore, Ross Mac Donogh was grievously * This appears to have been the old Irish mode of giving possession of lands. In England the ceremony was termed \" delivery of seizin,\" and was generally performed by handing a spd of the earth. In antient times a pair of gloves, a ring, &c. were delivered as a token of pos session."], [44, "32 wounded, and his brother taken, and the value of 5 suits of clothe? taken from them both, for the sept of Teige O'Brien and for him self. Furthermore to take 7 cows from Terence Mac Calvey, and to erect three crosses of interdiction * in Ballybeghan. The wit nesses for these 7 cows are O'Loghlan and John Tierny and the children of Eugene O'Conry and Muircertagh O'Flanagan. \u2014 Finally, the coming of Teige O'Brien into Ballybeghan and taking a milch cow worth three marks, and leaving her dead on the way, and 12 sheep and goats remained due of the restitution promised by him to them, and a woman's gown, a shirt and barread, and three groats in money.

D. 1619.* These presents have been made and written on the 15 th day of June, 1619, and make it known, that I, Honor, daughter of Daniel, son of John O'Muldowney of Ballyhybroackaran, by these presents do resign my right and title in the half quarter of Ballyhybriackaran, from myself, my heirs and assigns, unto Donat O'Brien, the Earl of Thomond, president of the two provinces of Munster, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, without laying any claim or preferring any suit to said land for ever. And I acknowledge to have received satisfactory payment from said Donat O'Brien, as consideration for said land, and I hereby give my own place, my release and as signment of said land unto said Donat O'Brien, his heirs and as signs for ever, from myself, my assigns and executors ; and also I, the aforesaid Honor, do acknowledge myself bound to go to every place which the Earl shall require of me to go, to secure him in the rightful possession of said land, to appear before the law, or go to any other place which the Earl or his heirs shall require of me to go. And I acknowledge, thro' virtue of the bonds by which I am bound, at every time that the Earl or his heirs, or his attorney * From this period few, if any, legal instruments were written in the Irish language."], [107, "95 shall require of me to appear to have these presents put into legal form, as the Earl's lawyer shall order, from time to time that I shall so appear.

Having now concluded this collection of Irish Deeds, I may, to the more ancient of them apply the description given of Saxon instruments of a similar nature, by the celebrated English Antiquary, Sir Henry Spellman. \u2014 \" The Saxons, in their deeds, observed no set forme, but used honest and perspicuous words to express the thing intended with all brevity, yet not wanting the essential parts of a deed ; as the names of the donor and donee, the consideration, the certainty of the thing given, the limitation of the estate, the reservation, if any were, and the names of the witnesses, which always were many, some for the one part and some for the other. \u2014 As for dating, it was not usual amongst them. Seals they used not at all, other than (the common seal of Christianity) the sign of the Cross, which they, and all nations following the Greek and Roman Church, accompted the most solemn and inviolable manner of confirming.\" \u2014 The Irish deeds of more recent dates generally come within the description of those commonly in use in the time of Hen. III. of England and afterwards, as given by the same Author. \u2014 \" I observe in the deeds of that time a very absolute and methodicall composition, which therefore hath ever since been re ceived, and conteyneth in a manner to this day ; consisting upon the parts here following : \u2014 1 . The Direction. 2. The Parties. 3. The Consideration. 4. The Words of Grant or Donation. 5. The thing granted. 6. The Estate of the Granter. 7. The Habendum or Estate granted. 8. The Use whereto. 9. The Reservation, if any were. 10. The Tenure. 11. The War ranty. 12. The Sealing and Delivery. 13. The Date. 14.
