I have divided the following History iuto chapters for the sake of distinct ness, and facility, and convenience of reference. At the end of each chapter the reader will find collected, under one point of view, the chief authorities for the statements there made. Of one or two of these sources of information I would desire here to speak very briefly. And, 1. Of the Register of the Priory of Blyth, which I have quoted indifferently by this title, or by that of Registrum Prioratus de Blida, or simply by the title of the Blyth Register. It is No. 3759 in the Harleian Library. It consists of 158 folios, and is 12 inches in length, 8 inches in width, and somewhat less than 3 inches in thickness. Sir Frederick Madden is of opinion that the great bulk of this valuable volume was written between the years 1290 and 1310. It is a MS. very creditable to the monks of Blyth, and is written in better ink, a better hand, and on better materials than the Welbeck Register, No. 3640 of the same library. It contains a transcript of ancient and original charters, made, I doubt not, during the time in which the Convent of Blyth was presided over by William Burdon, a man of active and business-like habits, namely, between 1273 and 1303. These transcripts are followed by documents, of later date, relating to transfers of monastic property, agreements between the convent and distant bodies, such as the corporation of Lincoln, and other matters. In a neat, small hand, at the beginning of the volume is written this date, \" 31 die Januarii, a. D. 1725-6.\" Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, was a great collector of books, in print and manuscript, which were preserved and augmented by the Earl, his son, and afterwards purchased by the British Museum. The father died in May, 1724, so that the above date is probably in the handwriting of the son. The Register appears to have once been in the possession of Sir Gervase Clifton, for Thoroton, in the preface to his History of the County of Nottingham, acknowledges his obligations to him for the loan of \" The Book of Blyth.\" 2. Sir W. Dugdale, in the first edition of the first volume of the Monasticon, printed in 1655, gives the foundation and other charters of the Convent of Blyth, \" ex rotulo chartarum Prioratus de Blida nuper penes Willielm. Saunderson de"], [12, "PREFACE. VI Blythe.\" This roll must have been a series of copies, and not the original charters. The transcriber appears to have used his own discretion in omitting those passages which, in his opinion, were unimportant, or, rather, which were tedious through repetition. The editors of the new edition of the Monasticon have, in their history of the Priory of Blythe, reprinted these charters, as given in the original edition, with omissions and errors which might have been prevented by reference to the Chartulary in the British Museum. Let me, however, acknowledge my obligation to this reprint for one good service. The Confirmation Charter of Henry II., as copied in the Blyth Register of the Harleian Library, ends abruptly with the words \"Teste Thom. Cancell.\" Avithout mention of other witnesses. This omission is supplied in the modern edition of the Monasticon, from Saunderson's roll given in the first, which furnishes us with the names of Roger Earl of Warwick, Robert de Dunstanville, and Ralph de Broc. What has become of the roll of William Saunderson I am unable to state. 3. I have made frequent extracts from the Domesday Survey. The abbre viations used by the Norman secretaries for carttca and carucata appear to be so indiscriminate that I have uniformly used the latter word, carucata. If the hide and carucate were the same, and contained 100 acres (vide Encyclop\u00e6dia Metro politana, part 12, p. 330, and Sir Henry Ellis's General Introduction to Domesday Book), the exclusive adoption of the word carucate in the following pages is not without its difficulties, as may be seen, e.g. at pages 15 and 16, where an inordinate quantity of land is thus assigned to the boardmen and villeins. Perhaps when speaking of these two classes of men as having so many car, the Survey should be understood as meaning ploug hs, and not quantities of land. It is much to be wished that some able and accomplished scholar would undertake the elucidation of this great national monument, which to Englishmen generally is at present a closed volume. A greater contribution than this could not be made to the illustration of the ancient condition of our country, physical and moral : and I know of no man better fitted for the task than my friend Mr. Hodgson Hinde. It remains for me to perform a very pleasing duty, that, namely, of acknow ledging the kind assistance which I have derived from others in the completion of this volume. To the gentleman whom I have just mentioned, my old school felloAv and friend, who for many years represented Newcastle-upon-Tyne with distinguished ability and integrity\u2014 John Hodgson Hinde, of Acton Park, Esq.

INTRODUCTION. Before the earth was prepared for the reception of her last and greatest tenant, man, nature had written her characters upon its face with an enduring hand. In some quarters of the globe these characters had been drawn with awful majesty and grandeur; in others, with stillness and composure. Skiddaw, Snowdon, Scawfell, and Benvenue, like those dark and precipitous and angry clouds which portend the coming storm, attest the gigantic and convulsive efforts amid which they were produced; Avhilst the undulating limestone hills and vales of South Lincolnshire, like those soft clouds which we so frequently behold reposing in the calm sky of a summer evening, bespeak a much more tranquil action. North Nottinghamshire has not been the theatre of nature's grandest operations. We no where behold the mighty mountain hiding its head in the cloud and the storm like Ingleborough; or the rapid river falling, like the Clyde at its falls, or the Tees at High-force, at one moment in a headlong cataract, at another forcing its Avay through a narroAV groove in the solid rock, like the latter river at Egglestone Abbey and Rokeby ; or those ponderous erratic blocks or bowlder stones of granite, porphyry, greenstone, and of other rocks, which are so peculiar a feature in our northern geology, and which, wrenched from their original beds, and carried far away by an irresistible current of water, have, innumerable ages ago, made a lodgment where we now see them, and where they will remain till the end of all things ; or the igneous basalt of Staffa, Stirling, and Barnborough; or those trap-dikes, as they are termed, running like veins for miles and miles across the country until they are finally lost in the ocean, which, although of small width, are of extreme depth, and which, heaved up from beneath in a state of fusion, have turned into cinder and ashes the coal formations wherever they have come into contact with them. Our mountains arc only hills of red sand, and our rivers are small and sluggish streams; and yet nature has left behind her some characters which will amply repay our study and investigation. Whoever will take his station upon the hills near Styrrup, or Everton, or Gringley, will at once perceive that the whole of the level ground now known by the names of Gringley, Everton, Misson, and Styrrup Cars \u2014 the latter extending through the lands of Tickhill, Stancil, and Hesley, to Rossington and Doncaster \u2014 has at one time been covered with water, which, divided by the high grounds of Plumtre, \"Bawtry, Martin, and Shooter's Hill, has to the north-east of Rossington Bridge formed one immense lake or estuary, covering the localities where now stand i'."], [20, "2 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. Haxey, Thome, and Hatfield, and, as we may reasonably conjecture, communicating with the Humber or the sea. The soil of these cars is all essentially of the same character \u2014 hlack bog, and is filled with trees, generally speaking pine, oak, and yew, which have evidently stood very thick on the ground, and, having fallen off at the base, and leaving their roots in situ, are buried about a foot deep, although in some instances much deeper. They have fallen in every direction. Wherever any unusually large tree has been successfully exhumed, its trunk and limbs look like the mighty carcase of some antediluvian megatherium. The tenants of these lands are gradually reclaiming them by extirpating these old occupants of the soil, which are converted to the practical purpose of fuel, or the more ornamental of garden fences and gateways. It is found, however, that after one or two crops the land becomes highly pulverised, and resembles dry soot, and the farmers are obliged to change the cultivation from arable to pasture land. When undergoing the process of paring and burning, the cars have been known to ignite to the depth of six feet, and therefore proportionate care is required on such occasions. Sometimes as many as six horses are found necessary for the removal of one tree. Horses dislike all novel work ; but on such occasions as these a fertile imagination would be tempted to suggest that their fears arose from apprehension that they were disinterring some mysterious creatures of a bygone age. Now, the question arises, how is the formation of such cars to be explained ? I conceive, then, that after the trees found on these lands had attained their growth an extensive irruption of the ocean, owing to a subsidence of the ground, took place; that they were either at once destroyed by this irruption, if sufficiently violent and powerful for the purpose, or that if it assumed the nature of a lake they fell through gradual decay at the point where they came in contact with the surface of the water, as the wooden viaducts over Avater of our railroads are now found to decay ; and that the water eventually returned to the sea by a subsequent elevation of the level of the ground, or was gradually filled up by vegetable matter. A tract of land exceedingly similar to the cars here described may be seen reaching from Canterbury to Pegwell Bay near Ramsgate. Through this bay the sea in ancient times extended to Reculver, forming the Isle of Thanet, and washing the base of Richborough Castle. At this ancient fortress Ethelbert King of Kent was residing when Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet, and hearing of the arrival of strangers in his dominions summoned them to his presence in that royal residence. The sea has now receded from this extensive tract of country, which is and long has been under fertile cultivation. The remains of Richborough Castle are now at some distance from the sea also : and within the ruined walls the ground is cultivated with the exception of a piece of masonry in the shape of a cross, Avhich is of such great depth that it has never been able to be removed; Avhich, according to immemorial tradition, marks the spot where the King of Kent was received into the profession of Christianity by Augustine; and at the sight of which in former times, being then elevated and conspicuous, seamen sailing up the bay are recorded to have lowered their sails in token of veneration and reverence. There is another interesting feature in North Nottinghamshire which deserves notice. The insignificant character of our hills has been mentioned. But there is one exception to this description. From Gringley-on-the-Hill to West Markham extends a bold and elevated chain of hills, composed chiefly of red marl, has shale, and limestone, which commands a very extensive"], [21, "3 INTRODUCTION. view of the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham, as well as of South Yorkshire, and from which, as the most remarkable feature of the district, the hundred of Bassetlaw, Bersetlaw, the Berset Hill, has indisputably in remote antiquity derived its name. We are in the secondary system, as it is termed, of geology, and upon the new red sandstone, consisting of loose sand and red sand rock, which is so prominent in the north of Cumberland, and which, sweeping around the northern and midland portions of the island from the mouth of the Tees through Stockton and the north and west ridings of York at Bedale, Knaresborough, and Doncaster; skirting the southern coal-field of Derbyshire; and covering almost the entire counties of Stafford and Chester ; finally disappears in the sea on each side of the Mersey. On our eastern side we are flanked by the lias and oolite of Lincolnshire, and with the excep tion of Bassetlaw and the noble elevation on Avhich stands the Cathedral of Lincoln, nothing meets the eye but one continuous and dead level until we arrive at the German Ocean. On our Avestern side we are far more highly favoured \u2014 Largior hie carapos \u00e6ther et lumine vestit Purpureo, solemque suum sua sidera norunt. At the distance of only three miles to the south-west of Blyth we enter the county of York, and immediately a glorious country with its bold magnesian limestone hills of Wickersley, Ro therham, and Sheffield, opens out upon us and gives us a foretaste of Airedale, Wharfdale, and Craven. From the peculiar geological formation of Nottinghamshire our capital town derives its name. Here, in the new red sandstone, our ancestors found extensive caves to which they gave the general name of Snottingham, from Snottinga, a cave, and ham, home \u2014 now corrupted into Nottingham. And it is probable that the adjoining village of Snenton owes its name to the same circumstance, Snottingaton, Snettingaton, Snenton. For here are extensive caverns of great antiquity, and many of the cottages are within the rock, which is pierced with doors and windows, and through which staircases are made to the gardens above. At Shireoaks, a small hamlet three miles to the north-west of Worksop, on the borders of the counties of York and Derby, and very near the point where they meet, the Duke of Newcastle has recently succeeded in finding coal. The strata through which the mine is carried shew the general formations which we possess in this neighbourhood, and are therefore here given, together with some general remarks upon the geology of the district. The upper beds consist of thin and alternate layers of soft sandstones and red marls, which attain a total thickness of 60 feet. The magnesian limestone follows, and is divided into tAVO beds, the yellow, which is very hard and crystalline, 54 feet thick, and the blue, below it, containing bands of blue shale 20 feet thick. Below the limestone were found 33 feet of blue shale, and then a very soft gritstone, 5 feet thick, of the same character as a rock met with in a similar position at Patricroft near Manchester, and the equivalent of the \" quicksand \" of the Durham coal-field. Underneath the gritstone the coal measures commence with 5 feet of blue shale, in which there are four bands of ironstone, and, immediately below, a bed of the same stone, 15 inches thick, but of a richer character. The ore is principally in the state of peroxide, and the bed and bands give B 2"], [22, "4 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. an aA-erage of 42 per cent, of metallic iron. The Messrs. Dawes, as tenants under the Duke of Newcastle, are now sinking a pit for the purpose of winning this stone. The ore resembles the Froghall ore of North Staffordshire, and that of a bed found at Patricroft in a similar position as regards the limestone. The first seam of coal was cut November, 1855, at a depth of 88 yards: it is 2 feet thick, and of inferior quality. Twelve feet below this came a compact sandstone or grit 66 yards thick, and of a very hard and open kind. Towards the west a great portion of it is covered by the magnesian limestone: but it crops out at Harthill four miles west of Shireoaks, and is there largely used for scythe stones, &c. It occupied a year and eight months to sink through this rock, and the total quantity of water made in each pit was 500 gallons a minute, which was stopped by cast-iron tubing carried to a depth of 170 yards from the surface. Below this point no difficulties occurred, the strata consisting chiefly of shales free from water. Several coals and bands of ironstone were met with in the next 170 yards, which were all thin, or of inferior quality. At the depth of 346 yards the first thick coal was cut, and found to be 4 feet 6 inches thick and of good quality. By practical geologists and engineers this was considered to be the \" Wath- Avood coal\" of Derbyshire and South Yorkshire, and was found at the same distance from the \" hard coal \" as in those fields. The principal coals betAveen the \" Wathwood \" and the \" top hard coal \"were found of very much the same quality and with the same thickness of intervening strata as known to exist else- Avhere. On the 1st of February, 1859, the \"top hard coal\" was cut at a depth of 510 yards, and proved to be 3 feet 10 inches thick. It exhibited the following section : The following are the points of greatest interest proved by this sinking : 1. The existence of a soft sand-rock at the bottom of the Permian beds in this district, which appears to be the equivalent of the \"quicksand\" of the north. 2. The absence of any workable seam of coal in this district, at least in the 300 yards of coal-measures above the \" Wathwood \" or \" Shireoaks thick coal.\" Thirty-seven feet of coal were passed through in the sinking, but only four seams are of a workable thickness. 3. The existence of a red ironstone in the upper measures, 10 inches soft. 10 inches hard. 3 inches bright. 12 inches spiry or mixed hard and soft. soft. 11 inches"], [23, "INTRODUCTION. 5 which promises to be very valuable. 4. The \" top hard coal \" seems to thin out towards the east under the magnesian limestone, since at Killamarsh and near its outcrop, six miles west of Shire oaks, it is 6 feet thick, whilst at Shireoaks it is only 3 feet 9 inches. The dip decreases considerably towards the east, the strata assuming more of a basin form. At Comberwood Colliery the dip varies from 1 in 6 to 1 in 12 : at Shireoaks it undulates, but has not been observed more than 1 in 36. With regard to the geology of this district, we may observe that the separate beds are so numerous as to give great variety to the general contour of the country and to the soil. The general inclination or dip of the strata is east, and the outcrop along a north and south line. Thus the new red sandstone, consisting of loose sand and red sand rock, first covers the Permian rocks along a line passing through the Worksop Manor Hills, Haggonsields, Gateford, and Carlton, and it covers the whole surface from Worksop to Retford, beyond which it in its turn is covered by the has. From Haggonsields to Kiveton Park the Permian rocks come to the surface, the principal stratum being the magnesian limestone, and it is the bold escarpments of this rock which give so picturesque an appearance to Bolsover, Cresswell Crags, and the Grips near Elmton. The other beds of the Permian series are so thin that they give great diversity to the soil Avhere they come to the surface. They yield excellent clay for brick making, and thin bands of pipeclay. They are remarkably well developed near Shireoaks. None of the preceding rocks are rich in fossil remains; but in this respect the geologist is better repaid for his researches by the coal measures, consisting of sandstones, shales, and beds of coal, which cover the surface as far as Sheffield. In the upper portion there is a very hard rock nearly 200 feet thick, which comes to the surface at Harthill, and is there extensively used for scythe stones, troughs, &c. It has also been found beneath the Permian rocks at the Duke of NeAvcastle's colliery at Shireoaks, and in a bore hole sunk several years ago at Lady Lee near Worksop. Here it yields so much water as to make a never-failing Artesian well, which in taste is very similar to the mineral waters of HarroAvgate, and contains large quantities of the bicarbonate of soda, sulphate of lime, common salt, and some sulphate of iron. Here therefore, perhaps, in after days a Midland HarroAvgate may be established. The Duke of Newcastle's success in finding coal at Shireoaks proves its existence in workable seams continuously from Sheffield, under the Permian rocks and neAv red sandstone. The seams lie so horizontal that the eastern limit of the field cannot be determined. A few words may here not inappropriately be added respecting the chemical nature of our soil. The following analysis of a superficial acre, one foot deep of average quality, on the red sand of Nottinghamshire, is given by the late Mr. Haywood of Sheffield : \u2014 Tons. cwts. lbs.

It requires to be nourished by phosphates in the form of bones; by gypsum, salt, lime, and magnesia, in various tillages; and under such treat- ment yields on the four-course system of cultivation excellent crops of wheat, barley, and turnips, as Avell as of clover : but as a general rule never answers the purpose of the farmer as permanent grass land. In luxuriant and fine timber, such as oak, beech, and elm, the combined influence of soil and atmosphere places us upon an equality with the most favoured districts of England. If now we pass from the physical characters which nature has impressed upon this district to the contemplation of those material and intellectual characters which man has left behind him, we become necessarily very much circumscribed in the period over which our investigations are per- mitted to extend. We are but of yesterday and knoio nothing. The intellectual monuments of man have generally survived his material works, and for an obvious reason. The oldest and deepest"], [25, "7 INTRODUCTION. strata, so to speak, of our language are of aboriginal date. The names of our neighbouring rivers, such as the Don, Trent, Derwent; and of our own rivulets, the Idle, the Maund, the Meaden; of our hills, such as Bersetlaw; of our cities, such as York, passing successively from the original Caer Eabhruc through the Roman Eboracum, the Anglo-Saxon Eoforwic and the Danish Jorvik to its present form, and Lincoln, compounded of the ancient Lindisse and the Roman Colonia; these and many more of the names of rivers, mountains, and towns, Blyth perhaps itself not excepted, are all of indigenous or Celtic mould. And that some, if not a considerable, portion of our language itself is derived from the same origin can hardly be doubted. For let us bear in mind that the Britons were the only people included in the pale of the Roman dominions who made a lengthened and determined stand for their independence. Italy, except some Greek fortresses, rapidly fell beneath the invasions ot the Ostrogoths and Lombards : Spain did not even offer resistance to the Wisigoths and other barbarous invading tribes : Gaul was passive : C\u00e6sar acquired but little honour in Britain : Hengist and Ida would have gained less, if the natives had acted in concert for the common defence. And even as it was we know that Wales escaped the Anglo-Saxon yoke, and that neither in Cornwall nor in Cumberland was it established until the tenth century. From first to last, namely, from a.d. 457, when Hengist founded the kingdom of Kent, to a.d. 586, when Cridda established that of Mercia, it took nearly a century and a half to erect the Anglo-Saxon polyarchy. The successive invasions of the Romans; Jutes, Angles, and Saxons; Scandinavian Normans or Danes; and finally of the Normans of France; like successive formations, blended with those British remains of an earlier age to which I have adverted, without destroying either these or each other, but rather producing that union of varied but harmonious and copious materials, out of which our language, our manners, and our institutions have arisen. Of the first nation, the lords of the world, we have vestiges either more or less distinct almost everywhere. Two of their great roads passed through Nottinghamshire, viz. Fosse Way and Ermine Street. The first, passing through Ilchester, Bath, and Leicestershire, entered the county near Wil loughby, and, passing through Bingham and Newark, conducted to Lincoln and across the Humber to the eastern coast. The second, leading from Pevensey and Regnum, through London and Lincoln, entered our county at Littleborough, which Camden believes to be the Agelocum or Segelocum of Antoninus, and proceeded to Doncaster and the North. To come to our own immediate locality, at Mantles, a detached house, not more than a mile from Blyth, were found two Roman urns, the larger inclosing the smaller, a few years ago ; and flanking Serlby Park is a long ridge or mound, which has long been reputed to be a portion of a Roman road. There are not wanting some evidences in favour of this supposition. It is the boundary of townships and parishes, and upon its summit and sides may be seen oaks of considerable age. At Arnold, a village about four miles to the north-east of Nottingham, is supposed to have been a central depot of the Roman forces of the district; whilst at Mansfield Major Rooke discovered, in 1786, consi derable remains unquestionably of Roman origin. Now, it is perfectly possible that from either of these places a Roman road may have led along the outskirts of the present park of Serlby, and joined at Bawtry that great trunk way, Ermine Street, just mentioned, which conducted from Lincoln across the Trent at Littleborough to Doncaster, Pontefract, Castleford, where it crossed the Aire, Aldborough, Catterick, Piercebridge, across the Tees, to the great camps of Binchester and Lanchester and the Vallum of Adrian. But, on the other hand, this mound of Serlby Park"], [26, "8 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. begins and ends with the park; on neither extremity have I been able to trace any continuation of it. I therefore hesitate between the two hypotheses of its being a fragment of a Roman road, and of its having been thrown up by an early lord of Serlby for the purpose of forming a boundary or inclosure. Passing from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon invasion, Mercia, the marsh land, was the last kingdom of the Heptarchy which was established. It was founded in 586 : it contained all the counties from the Thames and Severn to the Mersey and Humber, and eventually became, next to Wessex, the most powerful kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons are the great forefathers of the English people. From them we derive our name, and a large portion of our language and institutions. But, infused into all these, and most especially with reference to the midland and northern portions of the island, is another element, and that is the Danish. BetAveen the close of the eighth century and the time of Alfred the Great, these Scandinavian invaders, beginning with Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia, had possessed themselves gradually of the whole kingdom. But it was in the counties north and east of the Wash that their power Avas most successfully exerted, and the influence of their language and manners most perma nently established, in which, indeed, they bore a closer resemblance to the English inhabitants of these regions than to those of the south. The Wash, the Humber, the Tees, and the Tyne were most conveniently situated for the landing of the northern Vikings, and were their favourite points for disembarking. Very early they obtained possession of the five burghs as they were termed of Stamford, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln, which formed a chain of fortresses protecting them from the hostile incursions of the southern English. Their earliest settlements Avere around the Wash, and thence reached to the frontiers of Scotland. Nottingham was one of their strongest holds, and witnessed some of their severest struggles with the English people. The remains of their encampments and fortifications are to be found in great abundance in central and northern England, as at Flamborough, Driffield, and Easington, on the east coast of Durham; and in our own neighbourhood the very name of Danes-hill, and very probably that very remarkable conical mound Avhich exists to this day at Laughton-en-le-Morthing, comprising a ditch around its base, and an embankment about seven feet in width proceeding from the mound, and returning to it and inclosing a nearly circular area about 52 paces in diameter; and other smaller tumuli around us, attest a like origin. The impress of the language of the Danes is still more large and permanent. Words which to a southern would be perfectly unintelligible, but which are in common use in the vulgar tongue of North Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland, are purely Danish. Again, with respect to our local nomenclature, the Anglo-Saxon terminations of \u2014 ton, ham, forth, worth, which are the pre- vailing terminations of names of places in the south, are indeed to be found everywhere ; but as we adArance northwards they begin to be mixed more and more with names ending in the Danish by, ihorpe, thwaite, and others. In Lincolnshire alone there are no less than 212 names of places ending in by, and 63 in thorpe. Many of our neighbouring villages have Anglo-Saxon names; but there is one purely Danish word which enters into the composition of several of them. Ranskill ( Ravenskelf ), Ranby (Ravenby), Rayton (Raventon), and probably Sturton (East Rayton or Raventon), Leverton (Cled Rayton, Clay Rayton), Misterton (Minster Rayton) ; as also Ravenfield near Rotherham ; and further off, the ancient Ravenspurn on the Humber, all derive their orioin"], [27, "INTRODUCTION. 9 from Raven, the bird sacred to Odin, which Avas painted on the Danish banners and gave an auspice of victory in battle. We now come to another great epoch of our history, that of the Norman Conquest. At the time when Domesday Survey was completed, a.d. 1086, the crafty policy of the conqueror, the cupidity of his followers, and the continued rebellions of his new subjects, stimulating and stimu lated by both, had dispossessed the preceding proprietors of the soil around us, Earls Edwin and Morcar, the Countess Godiva, Swcin, Leuin, Brixi, Caschi, Elsi, and others ; who weire succeeded by Robert, Earl of Mortaigne, and Odo, Bishop of Baieux, maternal brothers of William, by Wil liam Peverel, said to have been his illegitimate son, by Alan, Earl of Britanny and first Earl of Richmond, who married his daughter Constantia, by our own great Norman baron, and the founder of our monastery, Roger de Builli, by Thomas and Remi, both of them foreign ecclesiastics, who assisted him in his expedition and were promoted, the first to the See of York, with grants in ad dition to those which his predecessors already possessed in the county of Nottingham, the second to that of Dorchester or Lincoln; by Hugh de Grentmesnil, Laci, Ferrers, Malet, D'Eyncourt, Gant, and other great men; among whom the lands of the county were parcelled out. Upon what principle, if upon any, the Conqueror proceeded in the partition of the estates of the Anglo-Saxon and Danish proprietors, it is not easy to determine ; but it is certain that he gave them an interest, probably gradual, as estates of previous proprietors happened from time to time to be seized by him, in localities very remote from each other. Roger Pictaviensis, for example, one of the lords of this county, is to be found as a proprietor in Craven. These barons Avere in point of territory and power little short of kings. Holding their estates immediately under the Crown, on condition of military service, they divided them on the same condition with a liberal and lavish hand among their friends and companions in arms. If the great tenants in cupite were princes, these their first subinfeudatories occupied a rank analogous to that of a modern large proprietor. \" Thus (in the words of Lingard) every large property, whether it were held by a vassal of the Crown or a sub-vassal, became divided into two portions of unequal extent. One the lord reserved for his own use, under the name of demesne, cultivated part of it by his villeins, let out parts to farm, and gave parts to different tenants, to be holden by any other than military service. The second portion he divided into parcels called knight's fees, and bestowed on military tenants with the obligation of serving on horseback at his requisition during the usual period.\" At the time of Domesday the country around us was uninclosed, and a considerable portion of it covered with wood. We scarcely ever meet with a town or village adjoining to which there was not a pasturable wood, sylva pastilis, varying in extent from one to four or five miles in length and half that number in breadth, the coarse long herbage of Avhich Avas depastured with cattle and swine. The process of reclaiming these Avoodlands, or essarting, as it was termed, Avas gradual and sIoav. We shall find for example that at Barnby Moor a large wood remained unessarted even to the close of the thirteenth century. In addition to these woodlands, Nottinghamshire was in ancient times celebrated for its Royal Forest of Sherwood, the mention of which occurs as early as the reign of Henry II. and the extent of which at that period appears to have been about twenty -five miles in length from north to south, and about seven or eight in breadth, bordering upon the town of Worksop at its northern extremity. Portions of the township of Hodsock, in this parish, are still known by the general name of The Forest, and indeed several tracts of land in North Nottingham- C"], [28, "10 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. shire, and in South Yorkshire, as far as to Rossington, have been reputed to be portions of Sher wood Forest; but from a survey made in 1609 they appear either not to have really belonged to it or to have been disafforested before that time. The chief remains of this ancient forest, so celebrated in the ballads of England, consist of the hays of Birkland and Bilhagh, in which to this day may be seen oaks of extreme age, with their gnarled and knotted trunks and decayed heads, and which give probably the most perfect conception of picturesque and Avild forest scenery which can be obtained in England. It would appear that the whole soil has been granted out by the Crown, with the reservation of the vert and venison. And here it may aid the general reader if I give a very concise explanation of the more common terms employed in those extracts from Domesday which are to be laid before him in the following pages. In drawing up this survey commissioners were appointed. In the midland counties, if not generally, were employed Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham, Henry de Ferrers, and Adam, brother of Eudo Dapifer, who summoned sheriffs, lords of manors, presbyters of churches, reves of hundreds, bailiffs, and six villeins of every village, and from them received upon oath an account of the name of every place, who held it in the time of King Edward, who Avas present possessor, the quantity of land, cultivation, number and quality of occu piers, value in the time of the Confessor, and present value. Carucata, carucate, a plough land, as much as could be managed with one plough and the beasts belonging to it in a year, Avith meadow, pasture, houses for the householders and cattle. In the counties of Derby, Nottingham, Rutland, York, and Lincoln, the carucate has been supposed to be co-extensive with the hide (not mentioned in them), or to contain six score acres. The abbreviations of the plough land (carucata), and of the plough (caruca), used in the Survey, are so confused as not readily to admit of distinction. I have in the folloAving pages adhered to the former term. Bovata, oxgang, as much as an ox-team could plough in a year. Eight bovates are reputed to have made a carucate. Leuca and Ouarentena, applied to woodland. Ingulphus estimates the former as a mile. But the old English mile was nearly a mile and a half of the present standard. Socmanni, the men of the soke, copyholders, Avith an interest equal to a freehold. They held the pleas of the manor court, and rendered to it suit and service. Villani, men of the vill. Under the Saxons they were slaves, and were the property of the lord of the soil, with their wives, children, and effects. The Normans mitigated in some measure their servile condition ; but still they were the property of their superiors, for whom they performed all the lowest services, and under whom they occupied small portions of land by way of supporting themselves and their families. In the following pages instances will occur of parents and their families, cum totd sequela, as the phrase ran, being transferred from one owner to another. Bordarii, board men, in a better condition than the villeins, held small parcels of land, and supplied their lords with provisions in kind, such as poultry and eggs, for their board. 'In conclusion, I would observe that little has been done hitherto, in any systematic and collected form, to elucidate the history of the county of Nottingham. Our only historian, Dr. Thoroton, in his preface, very quaintly observes, that \" the art of physic, which I have professed with competent success in this county, not being able for any long time to continue the people"], [29, "11 INTRODUCTION. living in it, I have charitably attempted, notwithstanding the difficulty and almost contrariety of the study, to practise upon the dead, intending thereby to keep all Avhich is or can be left of them, to wit, the shadow of their names (better than precious ointment for the body), to preserve their memory as long as may be in the world.\" And assuredly he has left us a history of dry bones, historiam jejunam et exilem, consisting for the most part of mere extracts from Domesday and other early public documents, strung together in the most dry, repulsive, and unintelligible manner. And yet, as from a mere fragmentary specimen, the skilful anatomist or geologist can deduce the character of an animal or a rock, so, from Thoroton's dry bones, a quick-sighted reader may frequently obtain a clue which shall guide and direct his investigations. The late Charles Mellish, Esq., for some years had made collections for a history of our county ; and, indeed, had completed an account of some of the southern portions of it ; but the loss of sight in his later years prevented him from carrying his design into execution. Detached accounts of portions of the shire, such as Southwell, Newark, and Retford, of more or less value, we possess. But, as I have remarked, avc have no good county history. Neither do I think that it is a work which will CA'cr be accomplished by the strength of one man. Intellectual and physical power, and pecuniary resources, adequate to the task, will hardly be combined in one and the same person. And, besides all this, the history of this county, studded as it literally was in ancient times with religious houses, must necessarily be attended with more than ordinary labour and difficulty. We must therefore rest content Avith the hope that the different deaneries or hundreds of which it is composed will be treated of by different men in succession, and that thus the topography of the entire shire may be attained in a satisfactory manner. The field Avithin which I have professed to circumscribe my labours is limited. And yet, as may readily be imagined, it comes frequently in contact with the civil and ecclesiastical history of the country at large. I have accordingly endeavoured, not merely to give a faithful and full record of the religious establishments, and of the transmission of property Avithin my own peculiar province, but also, where occasion appeared to suggest and to justify such a course, to illustrate from the transactions of this Parish, and of men connected Avith it, the history, not only of the Shire, but of the Church and Kingdom at large. In what manner I may have accomplished my task, I must leave to the candid and indulgent reader to decide. C 2"], [30, "12 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. CHAPTER I. DE BUILLI, THE FIRST NORMAN LORD OF THE HONOUR OF TICKHILL, AND FOUNDER OF THE MONASTERY OF BLYTH. Among those great Avarriors Avho fought under the standard of the Duke of Normandy at the battle of Hastings, and who were enriched, either through the gratitude or policy of the Conqueror, with the subsequently confiscated estates of the English proprietors, stands the name of Roger de Builli. We no where meet with him in the public transactions of the kingdom which followed that victory; but that he was a man who stood high in the estimation of William is clear from the very extensive grants which he conferred upon him. He was a man of high birth and lineage, being related to Roger de Montgomery, who accompanied the king on his expedition into England, and was by him created Earl of Shrewsbury and Arundel, for Robert, the son and heir of this earl, claimed and receiAred from Rufus the possessions of De Builli as his kinsman, \u2014 Montgomery himself being related to the Conqueror. So that, in this way too, De Builli was connected with Odo Bishop of Baieux, and Robert Earl of Mortaigne or Morton, maternal brothers of King William I., both of whom took a very prominent* share in public affairs during this and the following reign ; as also with Alan Fergent, Earl of Britanny, afterwards Earl of Richmond, who married the Conqueror's daughter, Constantia, and with William Earl of Warren and Surrey, who married another daughter. The three first-named of these eminent men were joint lords with De Builli in the county of Nottingham, and the Earls of Morton and Warren adjoined him in Yorkshire. It is probable that Roger de Builli derived his name from Busli or Builli, near Rouen; and this probability receives additional strength from the nature and constitution of his monastery of Blyth, an alien house, the appointment of whose prior was vested in the Abbot of the Holy Trinity at Rouen ; and from the concluding clause in his charter of foundation, in which he ordains that a pension of 40 shillings per annum shall be paid by his monks to that church. Those four mighty men, the lords of the Honours of Richmond, Pontefract, Conisborough, and Tickhill, literally spanned the country from the Trent to the Tees, nay, even reached beyond the southern river; for the last-mentioned Honour spread over portions of no less than five adjoining counties, those namely of York, Nottingham, Lincoln, Derby, and Leicester, and even comprised one distant manor in Devonshire. It contained in all sixty knight's fees and three-fourths of a knight's fee. THE POSSESSIONS OF DE BUILLI. I shall here lay before my reader a list, extracted from Domesday, of the places which, in whole or in part, owed feudal allegiance to De Builli in the county of Nottingham.

From an inspection of this schedule it is clear that Roger de Builli possessed a considerable portion of North Nottinghamshire ; and his estates in Derbyshire and Yorkshire were contiguous to this portion and to each other. Whether this contiguity influenced the selection of Tickhill, a central situation, as the capital mansion of the fief, or the previous choice of Tickhill guided the allotment of his estates, is of course matter of conjecture.

I will state very briefly that Laughton, with its aula and an extensive tract of country around it, had belonged to Edwin Earl of Mercia, the brother of Morcar, Earl of Northumberland. The sister of these tAvo powerful men Avas married to Harold ; and in his reign, as well as in that of the Conqueror, Edwin and Morcar played a very distinguished part. They rallied the English after the battle of Hastings, submitted to William, and were confirmed in the possession of their estates ; the king promising Edwin his daughter in marriage. The breach of this promise, added to other causes of irritation, again incited them to rebellion, and again they were obliged to throw them selves on the clemency of William. But their position was an unhappy one, exposed as they were to the distrust of the King and the malignity of his courtiers ; and they once more resorted to hostile measures against him. Edwin was betrayed by his own folloAvers whilst attempting to make his way into Scotland, and was slain by a party of Normans in 1071. The fate of Morcar is un certain. William of Malmesbury states, that he was slain through the perfidy of his own friends in the lifetime of the Conqueror. Hoveden, that he was released by William, when on his death bed, out of prison. Like every other large proprietor, De Builli divided his very extensive estates into two, and those very unequal, portions. Of the smaller portion, which went by the name of demesne, he retained a part for his own use, cultivating it by the hands of his villeins and board-men, and gave part to his sochmen, a class very similar to our copyholders. The second and by far the larger portion he parcelled out into knight's fees, and bestoAved on men of high family who had accompanied him from Normandy into England, with the obligation of supplying in cases of emergency a certain number of mounted soldiers, in proportion to their estates. And the sub- vassal pursued a course substantially analogous to that of the vassal in chief. Of his Nottinghamshire possessions Roger reserved in demesne lands at Clipston, Warsop, Worksop, Lound, Harworth, Styrrup, Hockerton, Marnham, Plumptiv, Normanton, Tollerton, Bingham, Bridgeford, Saxendale, Wheatley, Misterton, Bole, Leverton, and Rampton. The rest he parcelled out among his sub-infeudatories, the chief of Avhom were Roger, who was succeeded in his extensive grants by William de Lovetot, Lord of Sheffield and Hallamshire, through the gift of Henry I. ; Fulc Lizours, Torald Lizours his brother (of both of whom we shall have occasion to speak more fully hereafter), Goisfrid, Gislebert, Ernulf, William, and Ralph. Of the above enumerated manors the chief Avere those of Bingham, held in demesne with four carucates, twenty-six villeins, five board-men, fourteen sochmen, holding tAvelve carucates and a half; previous and present value 10/. Wheatley, held in demesne Avith four carucates, four soch men, and twenty-five villeins, having twelve carucates and a half, and five acres of meadow ; pre vious and present value 8/. Worksop, Avhere de Builli had one carucate in demesne and twenty two sochmen, holding twelve bovates, tAventy-four villeins, and eight board-men, with twenty-two carucates and seven acres of meadow; previous value 81., present II.

There was a church, as also two mills and twenty acres of meadow; previous value 4/., present 3/. Eaton, where ten thanes enjoyed each their OAvn hall, and where subsequently Fulc Lizours had one carucate, fourteen villeins, nine board-men holding seven carucates, and sixty acres of meadow. Headon, once the residence of seven thanes, in which William the sub-infeudatory under de Builli had two carucates, fourteen sochmen, nine villeins, and six board-men, holding sixteen carucates ; there were also twenty-six acres of meadow. And lastly, Marnham, held in demesne with four carucates, two sochmen on forty acres, and twenty villeins holding seven carucates and twenty-four acres of meadow. Churches are specifically mentioned, in addition to those just referred to, at Harworth, Bole, Leverton, Rampton, and Misterton, or as it is termed in the Survey, Minster-Reyton, to distinguish it from East-Reyton, now Sturton, and from Cled-Reyton, now Leverton. The prefix minster carries us back to a period of remote antiquity, antecedent to the formation of our present parochial system, when the church at Misterton was the only church throughout a large district in which the ministrations of religion could be obtained. There is one more circumstance, not only of an interesting but of an affecting character, which deserves to be noticed. Elmer, and Ehvin, and Osbern, and Edric, and Stenulf, and Godric, sand all the other proprietors in this district, with one exception, were removed from their antient J patrimonies and homes, and succeeded by men who were strangers to them and to the country in ' which their feudal superior placed them. The one solitary exception to which I allude was that of Ulchil of Clarborough, who before the Norman came owned here a small estate with manorial rights appertaining thereto; and who, rather than leave for ever his home and the inheritance of his fathers, submitted to become the vassal of another, and, in the words of Hume, when speaking of similar cases, \" to load himself and his posterity with a grievous burthen for estates which he had received free from his ancestors.\" O Lyeida, vivi pervenimus, advena nostri, Quod nunquam veriti sumus, ut possessor agelli Diceret, h\u00e6c mea sunt, veteres migrate coloni. I conclude my account of the lands forming the great fief of De Builli by stating that the honour of Tickhill was divided into five bailiwicks, which were entitled, \u2014 The bailiwick of Tickhill and the soke of Tickhill. The bailiwick of the liberty of Tickhill in Strafford. The bailiwick of Basset, in the county of Nottingham. The bailiwick of the liberty of Ultra Trent. The bailiwick of Scarsdale, in the county of Derby. THE FAMILY OF DE BUILLI. The manor of Sandford in Devonshire is said to have been given to Roger de Builli bv Matilda, the queen of the Conqueror, with his wife Muriel. We may infer from this that she stood high in court favour. Who she was is not known. Roger was dead in 1098 ; and he left a son who died without issue in 1102, as also a brother Arnaldus, and a sister Beatrix. Arnaldus was"], [35, "THE FAMILY OF BUILLI. 17 one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation of Blyth monastery. He and his descendants held six knight's fees and a half of the honour of Tickhill, a considerable portion of which was in the county of Nottingham, and the remainder at Maltby, Brodsworth, Scawsby, and Kimberworth, in Yorkshire. At the last place they had a mansion and park. They held Bawtry and Auster- field also under the Fossards, subinfeudatories under the Earls of Morton of a large portion of their Yorkshire possessions, and among others of the manor of Hexthorpe, of which Bawtry and Auster- field were members. The line of descent of Arnaldus ran as follows. Arnaldus.=p I J Jordan.^ I ' Richard and-p other sons. John.=p i J Idonea, married Robert de Veteri Ponte (Vipont). I shall pursue the history of this branch of the family of De Builli more at length under Bawtry. Suffice it for the present to state that these persons all have an interesting history attached to them. The first, Jordan, wearied probably with the world and its corroding cares, and anxious to obtain that peace which never fails to flow from the exercises of devotion, entered his uncle's newly-erected monastery of Blyth as a monk, giving at the same time a donation of land to the convent. On the day of his burial (die depositionis) his eldest son Richard, in the presence of several witnesses, laid his father's deed of gift upon the altar of the church, and attached his seal to it by way of confirmation. The charter in the Blyth Register (f. 105), from which we obtain these facts, is as follows : \" Notum sit omnibus Christi fidelibus tam futuris quam pr\u00e6sentibus, quod Iordanus de Bui \u25a0 leio annuentibus filiis suis et amicis dedit Sanct\u0153 Mari\u00e6 de Blida, quando monachum induit, terram Levini de dumo solidam et quietam, ab omni consuetudine liberimam. Postea vero Ricardus filius ejus major veniens ad pr\u00e6dictam Ecclesiam die depositionis patris sui coram multis astantibus hanc donationem super altare posuit et sigilli sui impressione roborando confirmavit sub testibus.\" This was early in the 12 th century. We come to Richard his son. He, as lord of Maltby, and Richard Fitz-Turgis, lord of Hooton-Levet, were the joint founders of Roche Abbey, in the immediate vicinity both of Maltby and Hooton, in the year 1147; a convent of Cistercian monks, whose desecrated and ruinous church, standing as it does at the confluence of two streams, and sheltered by massive overhanging rocks of limestone, on Avhich nature has placed her deepest tints, is still an object of lively admira tion and interest, as well as of heartfelt regret, to every well-constituted mind. John de Builli, the son of Richard, built the two churches of Bawtry and Austerfield, and gave them to the monks of Blyth. Idonea, his daughter, confirmed his gift. She married, in the reign of John, Robert de Vipont, a great Westmerland lord, and a man who was deeply concerned in the proceedings of those troubled times. She died in 1235, and with her ended the name of De Builli in England. I must now take up the history of Beatrix, the sister of our great Norman lord Roger. She D"], [36, "18 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. married Robert Earl of Eu in Normandy. The Earls of Eu of the old line were an illegitimate branch of the ducal house of Normandy, a circumstance which brought them much into England. Robert, the husband of Beatrix, was in Yorkshire in the early years of the Conqueror's reign, and was left by him in joint command there with the Earl of Morton. From this marriage sprang Henry, father of John, father of Henry, father of Alice Countess of Augi or Eu, a lady of great eminence, of whom we shall have occasion to speak more fully in what follows. THE CASTLE OF TICKHILL. No mention of Tickhill occurs in Domesday. The Survey states that in Dadesley, Stainton, and Hellaby, Elsi and Seward had been previous proprietors ; that then Roger held in demesne seven carucates; that there were fifty-four villeins, twelve boardmen, holding twenty-four carucates, and thirty-one burgesses (burgenses) ; as also a priest and a church; that the old value was 12/., present 14/. By Dadesley we are undoubtedly to understand Tickhill, for the extract above given stands in Domesday between Wadworth and Maltby, agreeably to the position which Tickhill actually occupies Avith reference to those places, and the name of Dadesley still survives, as applied to what may be called the suburbs of Tickhill. In a deed bearing date 1664 land is conveyed lying \" in the north field of Tickhill, at a place called All-Hallows Church.\" This doubtless was the site of the ancient church of Domesday, where even in the present century fragments of gravestones have been found. But whence the change of name from the one to the other ? I believe that Tickhill \u2014 Ticcan hiU \u2014 the hill of the kid, as Tickles, Ticklees, is the leys of the kid, and Titchfield the field of the kid, adjoining Dadesley, was a place natura et operibus munitus, in other words, that there was a natural elevation there, which in times antecedent to the Conquest, perhaps in some of those inter minable contests which our Anglo-Saxon ancestors carried on with each other, or subsequently with their Danish invaders, had been strengthened by artificial works for purposes of defence ; that the Norman de Builli took advantage of this already existing position, and upon it erected his castle, around which the population insensibly gathered, and from which their town naturally took its name, just as Castleton in Derbyshire, and Barnard Castle, derive their names from ancient fortresses erected there. That some fortress existed here before the Conquest may I conceive be not unreason ably concluded, from the high value at which the place stood in the time of the Confessor, from the mention of tradesmen (burgenses) in the Survey, and from the large population, exceeding probably that of every other place in South Yorkshire, with the exception of Doncaster, which would naturally derive security and protection from it. But the existence of such a population could not be entirely due to such a cause, and perhaps may, in some measure, be explained by the conjecture that in ancient Dadesley were located a number of small merchants who carried on the business of export in such matters as the building stone of Roche, long before the name of Roche was known, the grindstones of Wickersley, and perhaps the cloth and cutlery of the West Riding; and of the import of coal and various raw materials, to be worked up in the shops of the burgenses, and sold out among the farmers and villagers of South Yorkshire and North Nottinghamshire. Such import and export would readily be conducted through the neighbouring and very ancient port of Bawtry. The monuments of"], [37, "THE CASTLE OF TICKHILL. 19 mercatores in the churches of Tickhill and Bawtry \u2014 representatives doubtless of a long-established class \u2014 seem confirmatory of this conjecture. The Norman fortress of Tickhill then was erected upon a natural elevation. It Avas surrounded by a deep moat, encircled by a high and thick Avail, and, unlike that noblest of all our old castles, that of Richmond in Yorkshire, where the keep adjoins the entrance gateway, but precisely like those of Barnard Castle and Conisborough, its keep was at the most remote point from the gateway. Camden describes Tickhill as \" oppidum vctustum, vetusto castro satis magno, sed simplici m\u0153nium ambitu, et mole edita cui arx rotunda imponitur, munitum.\" The keep appears to have been in existence in Leland's time. \" The castel (he writes) is well dichid and waullid with a very hard suart stone hewid ; the dungeon is the fairest part of the castel ; all the buildings withyn the area be down saving an old haulle.\" It was circular, like those of Barnard Castle and Conisborough, not quadrangular, like that of Richmond; and portions of its masonry, the work of Builli, still remain, as also the old gateway, and nearly the whole of the surrounding wall, upon whose massive and Aveather-beaten sides the sun sheds an uncertain light through the trees with which the sloping banks of the moat are planted. The Avhole area, including the moat, covers very nearly seven acres, and within this area kings and queens, and the highest nobles of this and other countries, ecclesiastics and courtiers, knights and vassals, have assembled in days now long gone by, at one time amid the festivities of the banqueting hall, at another in the straitness of the siege. Eleanor, the queen of Henry II. founded within the Avails a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas for a warden and four chaplains, and endowed it with the tithes of Hanvorth, Wheatley, East Markham, AVcst Markham, Walesby, and Loudham. In the Pipe Roll of 1st of Richard I. there is an account of the revenues of the Honour of Tickhill for three-quarters of a year, before it was granted by the king to his brother John. It comprises inter alia the following items : \u2014 \" Radulphus de Wirecestre reddit compotum de xxxvi li. vi s. viii d. de exitu capellarum de Tikehill de dimidio anno. In Thcsaurario xxxiiili. vis. viii d. et in stipendiis capellani dc Tikehill vis. viii d., et pro bladis colligendis liii s. iv d. et quietus est.\" In the second year of his reign, John, on the petition of his mother Queen Eleanor, and in consideration of his father and brother Henry \u2014 rex junior, as he was called \u2014 having been buried there, confirmed the gift previously made by him, when Earl of Morton, of this chape] within the castle of Tickhill to the canons of St. Mary of Rouen, together with the churches of Harworth (including the chapels of Serlby and Martin), Wheatley, AVcst Markham (including the chapels of Kirton, AValesby, Houghton, Bevercotes, Drayton, Gamston, and Egmanton), East Markham, Bridgeford, Loudham, with the chapel of Gunthorp, Gunnalston, and various lands. The following entry respecting the chapel of Tickhill Castle occurs in the close roll of 8 th of John : \u2014 \" H\u00e6c sunt qu\u00e6 petunt Canonici Rothofn Ecclesi\u00e6 ii domino Regc.\" Inter alia \" Capcllariam de Tikehull datam a domino Rcge Joanne, quando suit Comes, ad quatuor prebendas ad facienda anniversaria patris sui et fratrum, qu\u00e6 valet Cm., undc lx.m. assignat\u00e6 sunt ad quatuor prebendas, et xl.m. assignat\u00e6 sunt ad obitum Regis Henrici et R. et J. Regum faciendum.\" The patronage held by foreign ecclesiastics in England was suspended during the wars between this country and France, and the chapel royal of Tickhill reverted to the Crown, and appears to have remained there; for in 1504 it was settled by Henry VII. on the abbot and D 2"], [38, "20 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH convent of Westminster as part of the endowment of his new chapel, and an annual pension of 51. was by them paid to each of the priests. It fell in the 1 EdAvard VI., being then granted to Mary Countess of Northumberland for her life, with remainder to her brother Francis Earl of Shrewsbury. Hence it is that the patronage of Harworth is to this day vested in the Duke of Norfolk. Amonc** the names of the wardens collected by Torre occurs that of Cardinal Beaufort in 139 . . To return to the castle. In the 1st of John the custody of the castle and honour of Tickhill Avas committed to Hugh Bardolph, sheriff of Nottingham and Derby. In the 6th of John, Robert de Vipont was constable of the castle of Tickhill, which he was commanded to put into a proper state of repair. The repairs were completed the following year, and the expenses allowed out of the Exchequer. Further repairs were made two years afterwards. In the 7th of John two tuns of wine were removed from Nottingham to Tickhill, and various stores supplied to the granary and stable at the latter place. In the 9th of the same reign 20 \" dolia \" of red wine, \" vini endurabilis,\" were purchased, of Avhich 15 were ordered to be conveyed to Nottingham and five to Tickhill. At the commencement of the Rebellion Tickhill Castle was put in a state of defence for the king and occupied by Sir Ralph Hansby, on whose death, in 1643, Major Monckton was placed in command, and held the fortress till a short time after the disaster of Marston Moor, when he was compelled to surrender it. The letter of Simeon Ashe, one of the chaplains of the Earl of Manchester, printed by Vicars in his Parliamentary Chronicle, informs us that the earl \" sent (from Doncaster) 200 dragoons under Colonel Lilburn to quarter at Tickhill, where was a strong castle, which was pallisadoed and invi roned with a broad moat and a counterscarp, in which were 80 musquetiers and a troop of horse, armed, which did great injury and oppression to the country thereabout, both by laying heavy burthens and taxes on them, and which did much interrupt the trade and transportation of cloth from Leeds, Halifax, and other parts to Bawtree; their horse also bringing in frequently 20, 30, 40 horses at a time loaden with cloth, which oftentimes, upon payment of 20 shillings the horse load, they again released. Now, upon the dragoons coming into the house, they took prisoner a captain, a cornet, a quarter-master, and some other soldiers, and about 30 horses belonging to the said castle. The governor of the castle understanding hereby that my lord's army was so near, and being now summoned the next day to surrender the same to the king and parliament, did admit parley with the said Lieut.-Col. Lilburn. Which conference produced this conclusion, that three of the chief gentlemen therein should come to my lord's quarters at Doncaster, upon a safe convoy granted for their return, which being done, and the gentlemen coming accordingly, on Thursday, July 25, 1644, it was agreed that the said castle should be yielded up the next day, upon four or five fair and honourable articles befitting gentlemen and soldiers ; which articles were sealed by both parties accordingly, and then his lordship, with lieut.-gen. Cromwell, major-gen. Crawford, and many other chief officers, guarded by a brave troop of horse, rode to Tickhill the Friday following, in the afternoon, to take possession of it, and to see the articles on our side exactly per formed. Whither being come, the drawbridge let down, and alarm made by our dragoons (to whom his lordship had given strict charge not to offer offence in the least measure by word or deed to the soldiers of the garrison who were to pass by them), they all came out Avith passes in their hands to the several places of their desired abode, who also were safely convoyed by our troops of"], [39, "21 THE HONOUR OF TICKHILL. horse; and so his lordship and his officers, with 20 musquetiers only, entered, and, possession being taken and some hurries appeased, my lord with his attendants gave solemn thanks to God there for giATing us that place of so much concernment upon most easy terms and without the loss of one drop of blood. There were in the castle major Monckton, governor, col. Redhead, major Redhead, and divers captains, with some of their wives. There was left in the castle one iron piece mounted, about 100 muskets, 60 horse and arms, some powder and match, about 100 quarters of grain, many barrels of salt butter, store of cheese, powdered beef, and some beasts and sheep, with other necessary provision.\" The Earl of Manchester left a garrison in it. One of the conditions of surrender of Welbeck, which General Poyntz took in 1645, was that Tickhill should be dismantled \u2014 which very probably took place accordingly either then or certainly two years later, Avhen the House of Commons ordered all northern fortresses in which there had been garrisons to be demolished. And thus the old Norman keep, the chapel of Queen Eleanor, the court where suit and service were rendered by the tenants of the fief in five counties, and civil and criminal jurisdiction exer cised, the great state apartments and all other members of the castle of Builli have almost or alto gether disappeared. The present residence is a house built in the seventeenth century, which has been occupied since that time by the different Crown lessees of the castle and demesne lands, such as the families of Hansby, Fitzwilliam, and Lumley \u2014 the last of whom now hold it under lease, their tenant being Captain Bower. THE HONOUR OF TICKHILL. We must now retrace our steps back to early days, and endeavour to relate the descent of this Honour. Whilst we are thus occupied, vivid and animating scenes Avill pass before us. From the pleadings in the suit between the families of Vipont and Eu respecting the Honour of Tickhill in the reign of Henry III., we learn that Roger de Builli left a son Avho died in 1102. Robert de Belesme, Earl of Shrewsbury and Arundel, obtained possession of the Honour from Rufus by paying a large sum for it. This we learn from Ordericus Vitalis, Avhose words are \u2014 \" Blidam* quoque totamquc terrain Rogerii dc Buthleio cognati sui jure repetiit et a Rege grandi pondere argenti comparavit.\" On the death of Rufus, Belesme, with AVilliam Warren Earl of Surrey, Robert Mallet, and others, incited Robert, the Conqueror's eldest son, to aspire to the Crown. Hoveden and Florence of Worcester record that in 1102 he garrisoned Shrewsbury and the castles of Arundel and Tickhill against Henry I., who, resorting to vigorous measures, and among other things sending Robert Bishop of Lincoln to besiege Tickhill, within thirty days recovered all the fortresses from the hands of his rebellious subject, banished him from the kingdom, and resumed his large estates. Henry I. retained Tickhill Castle throughout his reign, in the 29th * It is worthy of remark, that in some of the earliest instruments Blida or Blia stands for Tickhill. Thus, Henry I., in a charter confirming to the monks of Blyth the tithes of Laughton, speaks of \" Castellum de Blyd& \" ; the charter of Stephen, referred to immediately, speaks of \" honorem de Blia\" ; and John in the second year of his reign confirms to the cathedral of Rouen \"eapellariam de Blya;\" in all which instances Tickhill undoubtedly is to be understood. Tickhill was evidently a name which at that early period possessed no importance and was little known ; whilst Blyth, whether from the existence of its monastery or from the great antiquity of the place, was well known. If Blyth possessed an ancient castle of its own, a point which I shall consider in a subsequent chapter, that would be an additional reason for a confusion of names, the two places being near each other."], [40, "22 niSTORY OF THE PARISn OF BLYTH. year of which the castle and honour were in the wardship of Eustace Fitz John, lord of Alnwick and Malton, who renders account of 23/. 11s. lOd. \" de firma de Blida \" (i.e. Tickhill) for half a year; basin the treasury 13/.; spends upon corrody to the king of Scotland 1/. 10s.; and \"in operibus castelli de Blida\" (i.e. Tickhill) 9/. Is. lOd., and is quit. On the accession of Stephen it would appear that the Earl of Eu in company with William de Clairfait or FitzGodric, ancestor of the Fitzwilliams of Sprotborough, with the sanction of the king, held this honour. At the battle of Lincoln in 1141 between Stephen and Randolph Earl of Chester and his brother William de Romara and Robert Earl of Gloucester, the partisans of Matilda, the King and Barnard Baliol, Roger Mowbray, Richard Courcy, William Fossard, AVilliam Peverel, William Clairfait, and many others, Avere taken prisoners. William Clairfait however (writes John of Hexham, from whom I am quoting), cleverly escaping from the hands of Earl Randolph, betook himself to his castle of Tickhill, and by constant alarms harassed the Earl and his company. But the Earl of Chester was a powerful man. Like many other great men, he had his price, and a compromise was made between the royal rivals Stephen and Henry Duke of Normandy, after wards Henry II., by virtue of which they gave the Earl \" totum honorem de Blia ubicunque sit in Anglia,\" by which expression Ave are to understand the Honour of Tickhill. Henry II. when he came to the throne resumed the castle and honour into his own hands. His queen Eleanor probably enjoyed them as her jointure, for, as already stated, she founded the chapel royal of St. Nicholas within the castle. During this reign the Lacis, Lords of Pontefract, were tenants in capite of the honour and castle. AVe learn from Hoveden that in 1186 the kino* nominated Paulinus of Leeds bishop of Carlisle, and on his refusing the see offered him an annual pension of 30*0 marcs to issue from the churches of Barnborough and Scarborough, the chapel of Tickhill, and two royal manors near Carlisle. From Henry II. the castle and honour descended to Richard I., who at the commencement of his reign gave his brother John the earldoms of Morton, Cornwall, Dorset, Somerset, Notting ham, Derby, Lancaster, and Gloucester; the castles of Marlborough, Ludgershall, Bolsover, and Peak; and the Honours of Wallingford, Tickhill, and Eye. He reserved however certain castles in his own hands, among which were those of Tickhill and Nottingham, which in his absence abroad and in the turbulent proceedings of John and his partisans experienced great vicissitudes of fortune, being sometimes in the hands of the king and at other times surrendered to or taken by his brother. At the time of the release of the king from his captivity in Germany, namely, in the year 1 194 and just before his return home, the great men of the kingdom, lay and ecclesiastical, had, as we know from history, determined that John should be stripped of all his possessions in Eno-land and the castles which he held besieged. Accordingly Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, then nearly seventy years of age, collected a large army in the North, and laid siege to Tickhill, then in the hands of John's party. AVhen the king's return was announced, the beleaguered party sent with the bishop's permission two knights to ascertain the truth of the rumour, and if it proved correct to offer him the castle. Richard would take nothing short of an unconditional surrender, and on this answer being reported to Robert de la Mare the constable, and his party, they held a conference with Pudsey, and on promise of their lives delivered to him the fortress. The king had by this time arrived at Nottingham to conduct in person the siec-e of the"], [41, "23 THE HONOUR OF TICKHILL. castle there. Roger Hoveden's account of Pudsey taking his prisoners from Tickhill to Notting ham, of the king meeting and kissing him, and going to see Clipston and Shirewood forest, which he had never seen before, and with which he was vastly pleased, is very quaint and graphic : '' Vicesima septima die mensis Martii Hugo Dunelmensis Episcopus et illi qui cum eo erant in obsidione castelli de Tikehil venerunt ad Regem apud Notingham, adducentes secum captivos, qui capti fuerant in castello de Tikehil, et Rex processit obviam illis. Et viso Rege Episcopus Dunel- mensis descendit, et Rex similiter obviam ei, et osculatus est eum Richardus Rex Angli\u00e6 profectus est videre Clipestone et forrestas de Sirewode, quas ipse nunquam viderat antea, et placuerunt ei multum.\" I must be pardoned for making a short digression in order to speak a few words concerning Bishop Pudsey. Like many other prelates of that day, the warrior prelates of a stern age, he wore the sword by the side of the crozier ; but, unlike any other prelate, he Avore also, and that by creation and not inheritance, the coronet by the side of the mitre. He was Bishop of Durham from 1153 to 1195. He is said to have been nephew of King Stephen, but it is not clear how the consanguinity could arise. He was Archdeacon of AVinchester and Treasurer of York Avhen he Avas promoted to the see of Durham, at the age of 25. The nomination was resisted by the Archbishop of York, and Pudsey in consequence made a personal appeal to the Pope, accompanied by a splendid train of ecclesiastics and lay vassals of the bishopric, and was consecrated by him on the vigil of St. Thomas, a.d. 1153. In the war which Henry II. waged against Scotland, Pudsey 's loyalty was, not without reason, suspected, inasmuch as he had permitted a Scotish army to cross the bishopric with impunity, and 500 of their Flemish auxiliaries to land at Hartlcpool. He was heavily fined, and surrendered to the Crown his castles of Durham, Norham, and Northallerton, the last of which was demolished. When Richard I. was ransacking the treasures of the kingdom for the crusade, Pudsey pur- chased of him the earldom of Northumberland for life, and the shire of Sadberge in perpetuity to the see. The price was 1 1 ,000/., an enormous sum in those days. AVendover tells us, \" Versum est omnibus in miraculum videre Episcopum gladio militari accinctum de veteri Episcopo novum Comitem factum. Hugo de Puzaz emit sibi et Ecclesi\u00e6 su\u00e6 Northumbri\u00e6 Comitatum in vita sua. Quo gladio cincto Rex cum cachinno astantibus dixit, ' Juvenem feci Comitem de Episcopo veterano. Pudsey had intended to have joined the Crusade, and had accordingly made splendid prepara- tions, including, among other things, a beautiful galley with a throne of silver, and culinary utensils of the same costly material, for his own special use. But the king offered him a situation of trust and honour at home. He was made Justiciary of England, Governor of Windsor, and of all the kingdom north of the Humber. The ambitious Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and Governor of the South of England, decoyed him, through jealousy, to London, sent him to the Tower, and only released him on condition of his ceding the government of Windsor, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the earldom of Northumberland. He contributed 2,000/. tOAvards the ransom of Richard I., and redeemed for the sum of 100 marcs the plate of his cathedral, which was doomed to the same purpose. He contracted again with the King at the price of 2,000 marcs for the restitution to himself and his successors of the earldom of Sadberge, which accordingly continued in the see of Durham from that day till the time of the late Bishop Van Mildert, the last Bishop of Durham, who as Count Palatine and Earl"], [42, "24 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. of Sadberge received on entering his diocese at Croft Bridge suit and service as lord paramount from the lady of the manor of Sockburn, was welcomed by the congratulations of the mayor and corporation of the city in their town-hall in his attire of a temporal peer with a sword at his side, and in after life occasionally opened the proceedings of the assizes with the judges on each side of him as custos rotulorum of the county palatine. Pudsey was on his way to the South when he was seized Avith illness at Craike. In spite of sickness he proceeded as far as Doncaster, but was obliged to return by water to his manor of Howden, where he soon after died in 1195, and by his own desire was interred in the chapter house at Durham. He was a munificent benefactor both in a spiritual and temporal sense to his diocese. He built that most beautiful chapel, the Galilee, at the west end of the cathedral, whose massive Norman arches appear to press the light clustered early-English columns on which they rest into the earth \u2014 which things are an allegory. He founded and richly endowed the hospital of Sherburne for lepers, about three miles distant from Durham, which till 1833 \" exhibited in the house appropriated to the master much of coeval and subsequent architecture, in general of excellent character, and the more interesting and valuable on account of the rarity of such early specimens of domestic arrangement.\"* In the above year the whole of this ancient and venerable building was swept away under the mastership of the Rev. G. S. Faber. The late Mr. Rickman on visiting the place found only one room remaining \" with a stone roof, which for simplicity, beauty, and excellent preservation, he pronounced to have no equal in the whole range of his experience. Earnestly did he beg that this room might be suffered to remain, but without success.\" f Pudsey also built Elvet Bridge in Durham, completed the city wall, and added \" the donjon keep\" on \" Norham's castled steep.\" He built the beautiful church of Darlington, together with a mansion for occasional episcopal residence, and left in excellent repair all the other manorial residences of the see. In his capacity of Prince Palatine he granted to the citizens of Durham their first charter, and incorporated the boroughs of Sunderland and Gateshead. To return. At the death of Richard I. John succeeded to the castle and honour of Tickhill ; but in his troubled reign the great men of the kingdom were in open rebellion against their sovereign; and at its close Robert de Vipont, the husband of Idonea de Builli, had succeeded in making himself master of Tickhill, which he held at the accession of Henry III. In the fourth year of Henry's reign the conflicting claims of Vipont in right of his wife, and \u00b0f Alice Countess of Eu, her relative and contemporary, were tried in the Exchequer ; and two years after this a fine was passed between them, whereby the Viponts ceded the castle and honour of Tickhill to the countess, with the exception of the six knight's fees and a half in Maltby, Sandbeck, and Kimberworth, in the county of York; Stanford on Soar and Perlethorp in Notting hamshire, and in other places. As however the claim of Idonea de Vipont was clearly a stronger one than that of the countess \u2014 for the one was descended by the male line, the other by the female only, from Roger de Builli, we may conclude that the concession was not made without some recompense ; and such recompense appears to have been the gist from the King to Vipont of the Crown revenues in Cumberland. The Lady of Eu formed a strong attachment to this neighbourhood : and naturally. For she was struggling for and at length obtained the possessions of her ancestors, which lay in and were Raine's History of Durham Cathedral, p. 139, note. t Ibid."], [43, "25 THE FAMILY OF BUILLI. in fact nearly co-extensive with it. There exist charters of her benefactions to the religious of Blyth and Roche. As a matter of course she was, under the Crown, lady paramount of the honour : and hence it is that we find John de Orreby and Thurstan the steward holding under her in Bilby a third and a twelfth part of one knight's fee; AVilliam, son and heir of Roger Cressy, her ward, holding in Hodsock again under her the whole vill with soc by service of one knight's fee; and in Styrrup, Ingeram the son of Galfrid and others occupying one knight's fee under her also. She left England in 1225- In 1254 the castle and honour were given in dower to Eleanor, the wife of Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I. Nine years after this the Prince gave them to his cousin, Henry of Almaigne, with a view of detaching him from the party of Montfort. In the 18th Edward I., 1290, the claims of the house of Eu were revived. Alice had left a daughter and heir, who married Alphonso, son of John King of Jerusalem, and in his wife's right Earl of Eu. Their grandson, John Earl of Eu, in this year came before the King and Parliament and demanded restitution of the castles of Tickhill and Hastings, with their dependencies, which had belonged to his great-grandmother, Alice. The answer, a truly English one, made to him was, that he was an alien, and that when the King of France should restore to the English nobility their possessions in his dominions his claims should be taken into consideration. This was the last attempt made by the house of Eu to gain possession of Tickhill, and hence forth the castle and honour were vested in the Crown or in temporary grantees under it. The connection however Avas remembered so late as the reign of Henry V., who created AA'illiam Bourchier, Earl of Eu and Lord Bourchier of Tickhill. In the reign of EdAvard II. Tickhill Castle Avitnessed another siege during the turbulent and rebellious proceedings of Thomas Earl of Lancaster. This untortunate but criminal person was on the Monday before the Feast of the Annuncia tion, 1322, brought at Pontefract Castle before the king and court, consisting of Edmund Earl of Kent, John Earl of Richmond, Adomar de Valence Earl of Pembroke, John de Warren Earl of Surrey, Edmund Earl of Arundel, David Earl of Athol, Robert Earl of Anegos, and others; and charged with coming to Burton-on-Trent with Humphrey de Bohun, late Earl of Hereford, Roger Damony, and others, stopping the King for three days from passing the bridge there, and burning part of the town, from whence he fled, \" cum equis et armis ac vexillis explicatis,\" to Borough bridge, where he Avas taken. For all Avhich crimes he is sentenced to be drawn, hanged, and beheaded. It is added that, in time past, the said Thomas conducted himself wickedly and maliciously towards the lord the king; as for example: | 1. He stole and carried off the king's victuals, horses, jewels, and other property at New Castle on Tyne; which the king pardoned. 2. AVhcn the king commanded his barons and others to meet at York to consult with him concerning an expedition into Scotland, the said Thomas, then being in his Castle of Pontefract with a large force, sent his men to stop the road near that town, and to hinder the barons from o-oin-T to the Parliament at York : and Avhen the king Avith his family came southwards, Thomas G G G J ' and his men came out of the castle and \" acclamaverunt in ipsum regem vilissime et contemptibi liter cum magno tumultu, in maximum contemptum ipsius domini regis, ac si dominus Rex fuisset eorum inimicus et non rex, ncque eorum dominus.\" E"], [44, "26 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. 3. \" Et misit homines suos una cum pr\u00e6dictis comproditoribus suis ad obsidendum castrum domini regis de Tikhull, et qu\u00e6dani ingenia ad projiciendum petras grossas super castrum pr\u00e6dictum, et homines in eodem castro ex parte domini regis existentes; qui quidem proditores castrum illud per tres septimanas continue insultando et debellando obsederunt, et quosdam homines regis ibidem interfecerunt.\" The king remitted the draAving and hanging on account of the earl's excellent and most G G G G noble parentage, but, as is well known, he was beheaded near Pontefract Castle: and very soon acquired the title and honour of saint, especially among the poor, whose wrongs he was thought to have vindicated. By Edward III. Tickhill eastle and honour were settled on his queen Philippa. Three years after her death, namely, in 1372, he gave them to John of Gaunt, \"time-honoured Lan caster,\" with other estates, in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond. At the duke's death they were given in dower to his AvidoAv Catharine Swinford : and during the ascendancy of the house of Lancaster remained distinct from the Crown, as something in case of disaster to fall back upon, although the Crown enjoyed their revenues. So they continue to this day. There are two objects more connected with Tickhill on which 1 will add a few words before I conclude this chapter. I mean the church and the priory of St. Augustine. The church, with the exception of the lower stage of the tower, which is early- English, is of Perpendicular character, and contains one feature which is not very common, and that is, a clerestory window over the chancel arch. The armorial bearings of several of those who contributed to the fabric of the tower, especially those of John of Gaunt, (the arms of Castile and Leon,) and of John Sandford, (Ermine, two boar's heads in chief,) who died in 1429, leaving by will \" to the makyng of the stepell of Tykhill es', a cart with iiij hors,\" appear on the western front of the church. The priory of Austin Friars, portions of which still remain, stood about half a mile from Tickhill, and is supposed to have been founded in the reign of Edward I. by John Clarel, preben dary of Southwell and rector of East Bridgeford, in the county of Nottingham. It was the place of sepulture of several of the Clarels and Fitzwilliams, and stood in a singularly secluded spot.

The parish of Blyth contains the following entire townships, namely, Blyth, Barnby Moor with Bilby, Torworth, Ranskill, Hodsock, all situated in the Hatfield division of the wapentake of Bassetlaw, in the county of Nottingham ; and portions of the townships of Olcotes and Styrrup, in the same division, hundred, and county. It further comprised the townships and chapelries of Bawtry and Austerfield in the south and north divisions of the wapentake of Strafforth and Tickhill, in the west riding of the county of York, until these were by order of Council bearing date July 31st, 1858, separated at once with my consent from the mother church, and constituted a distinct benefice. Still, considering the long ecclesiastical connection which has existed between these places and Blyth, I have deemed it right to include them in my History. The whole nearly of the Nottinghamshire portion of the parish was originally included in the great fief of Roger de Builli, with the exception of Ranskill, which Avas given to Thomas Arch bishop of York at the Conquest. De Builli's interest in Barnby Moor was by his foundation charter given to the Convent of Blyth in 1088; and they continued chief lords of the place till their dissolution. I say chief lords, because it would appear that the king at the time of Domesday survey had an interest there. I propose, therefore, to treat of Barnby Moor immediately after Blyth ; and shall then take the remaining townships in the order in which I have just placed them.

I have seen a stern unyielding rock in the sea, which has for countless ages successfully resisted the waves which have raged around it. Even so is it with regard to some of our local names. Probably in no kingdom of the ancient Heptarchy was the power of the Danes more predominant than in Mercia. And yet the names of some of our towns and villages stubbornly resisted the invasion of the stranger, and remained true to their ancient birth and lineage. Nay, E 2"], [46, "28 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. it may be that they were in existence even before the prior invasion of the Saxon \u2014 that they Avere autocthonous, or of pure Celtic coinage, and have come down to us through the lapse of time and the revolutions of ages, with their superscriptions faded indeed, and impaired and obscured, but, as far as they are legible, pure and genuine. I believe the name of Blyth to be of extreme antiquity. From the very \u00e6ra of the Conquest it presents itself to us under the curt forms of Blia, Blya, Blida, Blye, wrapping itself up under an impenetrable coat of mystery, and refusing to tell its origin. AVe have a place named Blidworth in the county of Nottingham; and by analogy we may be led to conjecture that Blyth is Blid hithe, the river station or port of Blid, just as Ave have Queen-hithe, Rother-hithe, Clay-hithe, Lamb-hithe (Lambeth); but what Blid indicates, whether a personal name or some natural quality or characteristic of the spot, I am not prepared to say; and I submit this etymology to the learned reader with great diffidence. From the Domesday extract, given at the beginning of this chapter, it is clear that in Saxon times the population of Blyth was small, and the state of cultivation of the adjoining lands low. The commissioners do not even tell us either the previous or present yearly value of the place. It is a subject which admits of doubt whether a castle existed here in Saxon and early Norman times. True, indeed, it is that we have (1) a charter of Henry I. before the year 1108, in which he confirms to the monks of Blyth the tithes of Laughton, as they enjoyed them when he took \" ad meum opus Castellum de Blyda;\" (2) a compotus of 29 Henry I. a.d. 1129, inserted by mistake in the Northumberland Pipe Roll, in which Eustace FitzJohn, Lord of Alnwick and Malton, renders an account of ixl. Is. 10 d. \"in operibus Castelli de Blida per breve Regis;\" but then we know from history that, in 1102, Henry I. wrested Tickhill Castle from the hands of his enemy, Robert de Belesme, Earl of Shrewsbury and Arundel, and kept it in his own possession throughout his reign. So that it is highly probable, if not quite certain, that by Castellum de Blida in the above instruments, Tickhill Castle is really meant. On the other hand, we have a charter of Henry II. attested by Thomas the Chancellor, Ralph de Broc, and others, at Blyth, and exempting the tenants and other dependants of the monks from appearing at the shire and hundred courts, and from pleading any where, \" nisi ad Castellum de Blida.\" AVe have an extent, as it is termed, or statement of receipts and expenses of the convent in 1379, in Avhich express mention is made of an ordinary court held by them once in every three weeks, of two great annual courts, and of a seneschal or steward and clerk of the said courts. AVe have also the testimony of Leland that a tradition of such a fortress existed in his time:* and finally, to this day such tradition exists, strengthened it would seem by some local names. It is, therefore, not improbable but that a castle did stand at Blyth in early times, and that it may have helped to cause the confusion which ancient charters display between Blyth and Tickhill. It is clear, hoAvever, that it gradually sank into insignificance by the side of its more distinguished neighbour, the Castle of Tickhill, which De Builli made his capital residence. No mention is made in Domesday of a church at Blyth ; and yet it is difficult to conceive that so extensive a district as that which is now comprised in the Nottinghamshire portion of the parish should have been without one. The fact is, that the silence of the Survey as to the existence of a church in any given place is not conclusive evidence that none existed. Thus one * \"I asked of a castelle that I hard say was symtyme at Blyth : but other aunswer I larnid not but that a little or I cam ynto the town ther apperith yn a woodes sides token of an auncient building.\""], [47, "29 THE MONASTERY. church only is found in the return for Cambridgeshire, none in Lancashire (between the Ribble and the Mersey), Cornwall, or even in Middlesex. And in our own immediate neighbourhood the Survey makes no mention of a church at Laughton, although the parish then comprised not merely Laughton itself, but also Wales, Anstan, Thorpe Salvin, Letwell, and Firbeck ; at all which places, churches or chapels were of subsequent foundation. In addition to all this, it must be borne in mind that Roger de Builli, in his foundation charter of the monastery, only two years after the completion of Domesday, expressly includes among his donations the church of Blyth. Of this old Saxon church, however, no visible vestige remains. It Avas replaced by the Norman church of the convent. AVe may further remark that, previously to the establishment of the monastery, the inhabit ants of Blyth were under the manorial jurisdiction of Hodsock, Mansfield, and Bothamsall; but when Roger settled his monks here in 1088, he made the prior lord of the manor of Blyth, with perfectly independent powers, and the enjoyment of such rights and privileges as from time imme morial had appertained to a manor. Foundation of the Alien Benedictine Monastery of Blyth. AVe come now to the era immediately succeeding the Conquest. One might have thought that the site afterwards occupied by the Austin Friars, near Tickhill \u2014 a warm and sheltered vale, Avithin -a. milejof his own castle \u2014 would have presented itself to the mind and taste of the great Norman lord of the honour of Tickhill, as a peculiarly eligible spot in which to plant his convent. But Blyth possessed that which Tickhill did not possess, a river; and this, probably, was one great reason why Dc Builli established his Benedictines at the former, and not at the latter place.

By this deed the convent of Benedictines of St. Mary of Blyth was founded, which has given a colour and a character to the subsequent history of the parish, both civil and ecclesiastical, to this very day. Henceforth the House becomes the central focus to which converge the benefactions of the chief proprietors of the parish, Builli, and Vipont, and Moles, and Lizours, and Cossard, and Cressy, and John the Constable, and Philip of Olcotes. The deed was attested by the founder's brother, Arnaldus, of whom mention has already been made; AValter Deincourt, one of the original grantees of lands in Nottinghamshire; Thorald de Chevercourt, whose relative, Ralph de Chevercourt, was the founder of the Nunnery of Wallino*- Avells; Thorald de Lizours, the subinfeudatory of Hodsock, and other estates; Fulc, his brother, the ancestor of the Fitzwilliams of Sprotborough; Ralph de Novomercato (Newmarch), who held property at Bentley, and whose family Avere lords of AVhatton, in Nottinghamshire, and benefactors to the convent; Radulphus Dispensator; Godefridus Dapifer: Gilbert, William, and Richard, priests; Claron and Pagan. With this original endowment then of their pious founder in their hands, the religious of Blyth laid, in faith and hope, the first stone of that church which was to stand for ages, and which still, after the revolutions of time, the unceasing vicissitudes of all human things, and the changes and mutilations which itself has undergone, remains a monument of that deeply scientific skill, and of that noble-hearted generosity, with which our ancestors built not only for themselves, but for all time. A man like Builli, connected with kings and queens, and the highest nobles of the land, possessing too through the gist of his late sovereign enormous wealth and influence, was not likely to permit this inaugural ceremony to pass Avithout lively and even splendid demonstrations of joy and festivity. It is quite within the legitimate scope not only of imagination but of proba bility to suppose that the great Norman himself with his own hands laid the first stone of the church of his own convent, surrounded on one side by his venerable diocesan, Thomas, Arch-"], [49, "31 POSSESSIONS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE CONVENT. bishop of York, upon Avhom the Conqueror had bestowed the lordship of Ranskill in our parish, who was himself a Norman, and had been before his elevation to the archiepiscopal throne canon of Baieux and chaplain to William, whom he assisted in his enterprise Avith his wealth \u2014 the re-builder of his ruinous minster and the re-constructer of his impoverished chapter \u2014 a learned, pious, and exemplary man, \"juvenis vigore et \u00e6qualitate membrorum commodus, senex vivid\u00e6 faciei et eapillis cygneis,\" as Malmesbury describes him; by Remigius, another Norman, Avho had been a monk of Fescamp, Avho also like Thomas had assisted AA^illiam in his expedition and was rewarded with the see of Dorchester \u2014 the builder of the first cathedral of Lincoln, a commissioner for executing the Domesday Survey in the midland counties, and like the Archbishop of York holding by gift of the Conqueror large estates in our county; by Odo Bishop of Baieux, brother of the Earl of Morton and half-brother of the Conqueror, himself too one of the tenants in capite of Nottinghamshire \u2014 -an ambitious and restless man \u2014 who on this festive and auspicious day laid aside the sword for the mitre and crozier; and on another by the Earls of Morton, AVarren, and Ferrers, by Peverel, Deincourt, and Laci; and by his OAvn great subinfeudatories Arnald, Roger, Torald, and Fulc.

Possessions and Piuatleges of the Convent. We must now return to an analysis of the original deed of endowment. Roger gives his convent : I. The Church of Blyth. \u2014 If then before this charter Avas executed there was a rector of Blyth (a vicar there could not be, inasmuch as the institution of the vicarage Avas of subsequent date, and necessarily implied the existence of the convent,) he was superseded by the convent, who themselves became rectors, received the rectorial tithes of the parish, and performed all spiritual offices for the parishioners, until a vicar was in course of time appointed. These arbitrary consecrations of tithes to religious houses at the discretion of the lay patrons were, as the learned Sclden sIicavs in the sixth and eleventh chapters of his History of Tithes, not uncommon either abroad or at home even before the Conquest, Avhilst in England especially, subsequently to that event, they became prevalent in proportion to the rapidity Avith Avhich convents arose. II. The avhole village of Blyth with all services appertaining to and due from the occupants and dependants to the prior as lord of the manor and proprietor of the place, such as ploughing his lands, making his hay, cutting and leading his crops, holding market, and making mill-race. III. Toll of Goods from the water of Radeford, the river at AVorksop, to that of Theornewad (the Torne), and from that of Frodestan to that of Hidil (the Idle). In the hundred rolls of Notts 4 EdAvard I. the jury made return that the prior and his bailiffs took Ad. toll for every sack of wool, whereas they used only to demand 2c?. for every cart load, and so Avith regard to all other merchandise, to the great injury of merchants. However, in the pleas of Quo Warranto for Notts in the reign of EdAvard III. the prior,"], [50, "32 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. through his attorney Robert de Bekyngham, described very minutely the amount of toll claimed upon various articles and the boundaries within which he and his predecessors from time imme morial had exercised the right. The Avestern boundary ran from Radeford to Shireoaks, thence to Anstan, and thence to Frodestan; the northern from Frodestan to Laughton, thence to Field, thence to Malpas, thence to Rossington, and thence to the Torne ; the eastern from the Torne to Bawtry, thence to Scrooby, thence to Mattersay, thence to Sutton, thence to West Retford, and thence to the Idle; the southern from the Idle to Ordsall, thence to Twyford Bridge, thence to Normanton near Bothamsall, and thence to Radeford. Within these boundaries the convent received toll at the following rates \u2014 for every cartload of timber (carecta de m\u00e6remio) or bread for sale, one halfpenny; for every cartload of any other article for sale, tAVO pence; for every horseload of salmon (de quolibet sumagio equi portantis salmonem) for sale, one penny; for every horseload of any other article, one halfpenny; for every man carrying on his back a load of merchandise, one farthing; for every horse, ox, or coav, of the nature of merchandise, one half penny; for every sheep and pig, one farthing; and for every sack of wool packed and sold at Blyth, four pence. The jury allowed that the prior was entitled to these and other ancient privileges. The Blyth Register, f. 132, contains a notice of a compromise between William the prior of Blyth and the citizens of Lincoln on the subject of these tolls. The latter had taken proceedings in the Exchequer against the convent for exacting tolls and customs from them in Blyth and elsewhere. The proceedings were terminated through the mediation of common friends \u2014 the convent ceding all future claims either within the liberty of Blyth or elsewhere, and the citizens Avaiving all claims for recompense on the score of past demands. A remnant of these tolls, in the shape of charges made on behalf of the lord of the manor upon cattle passing through Blyth from Scotland to the southern markets, existed till Avithin the last twenty years, when they, a\u00a7 well as the tolls taken at the two annual fairs, were discontinued. IV. Fair and Market, soc, sac, tol, theam, infangthief, minerals, and gallows. The fairs, as the prior pleaded in the time of Edward III. were held from time immemorial on the vigil, day, and morrow of St. Dionysius (October 9): and on the vigil, day, and morroAv of the Ascension. The two annual fairs of Blyth are to this day held at precisely the same times \u2014 one on Ascension Day, the other on October 20 \u2014 the change of eleven days in the case of the latter being due to the alteration of the style and calendar in the middle of last century. Till within the last few years a certain number of men were appointed, under the name of watch and ward, to assist in the proclamation of these fairs, in the collection of tolls, and in the preservation of the peace. The market was held on Thursday from the earliest times. It has for a century fallen into disuse. Soc, a certain territory within which the power of sac was exercised, that is, the power inherent in a proprietor or lord of a manor of hearing and determining civil disputes and taking cognisance of crimes in his own hall-mote. G Tol, certain alloAvances paid to the prior as lord of the manor out of articles sold in market or fair. Theam, a power granted to him to hold, restrain, and judge bondmen, neifs, and villeins, Avith their children, goods, and chattels (cum tota sequela). Infangthief, a thief or robber found within the limits of the manor with the stolen goods upon"], [51, "33 POSSESSIONS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE CONVENT. him, and the power of trying such an offender in the manor court and punishing him. Some writers state that the power implied in infangthief extended only to the lord's own dependants ; outfangthief to foreigners caught within the liberty. Gallows (furc\u00e6). The reader will find under my account of the tOAvnship of Hodsock that per mission was given by the Cressys to the priors of Blyth to hang criminals on their gallows, which stood on Blyth Law Hill. In the Hundred Rolls 3 Edw. I. there is an account of a cut-purse being caught by the bailiffs of Blyth in the market. Peter de Parkes the seneschal of Tickhill sent Hugh Patz, AATilliam Cock, and Roger Clenegris, who took the unhappy thief out of then hands and carried him to Tickhill; and, when the prior claimed that he should be tried in his court, the Tickhill bailiffs demanded five shillings for his surrender, and, on the prior's refusal to pay the money, hanged the culprit at Tickhill. These were perilous poAvers to vest in the hands of irresponsible persons ; but the feebleness of the executive rendered them necessary, and every great baron and many ecclesiastics possessed them. Our local names to this day attest their prevalence. Near Cockermouth is a mound termed Garrow-barrow, that is, the gallows barrow: near Bowes Castle, in the north riding of Yorkshire, again is a hill knoAvn by the name of Gally-hill, the gallows hill; and at Barnard Castle is a street, Gallgate, the gallows gate, on and near which the lords of Cockermouth, Bowes, and Barnard Castle executed criminals. Ferrum et fossum: minerals and treasures dug out of the ground \u00a9 G Roger proceeds to give the convent of Blyth V. Elton, and whatever appertains to it. This place is near Nottingham. The manor had belonged to the great Earl Morcar, and at the time of Domesday was owned by Roger's sub infeudatory Ralph, who in 1088, when the manor was given to the convent, was probably dead. This gist opens up an interesting history. In the first place there was a church, which fell to the possession of the convent. AVhcther the monasteries and other ecclesiastical corporations were not satisfied Avith their position of rectors aggregate, by virtue of which they received the emoluments of benefices and were charged with the performance of all spiritual offices, or whether the ordinary considered such a state of things prejudicial to the church, it is certain that in course of time appropriations were made, that is, the great tithes Avere severed for the use of these corporate bodies, and the small tithes reserved for the endowment of a fixed and permanent minister, under the name of vicar. Agreeably to this, Roger Archbishop of York, the contemporary and enemy of Thomas Becket, granted the monks of Blyth an appropriation of the church of Elton. It would seem, however, that it was not carried into effect, for Walter Grey, one of Roger's successors, in the reign of Henry III., gave them an annual pension of two marcs out of the rectory and the great tithes of their own demesne lands there. The rectory is now in the patronage of W. F. N. Norton, esq., and the pension of two marcs is to this day paid by the incumbent to the Master and Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, the rectors and patrons of Blyth. In the second place their temporal possessions and services present us with a singularly striking picture of the social condition of the country at large in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The Blyth Register contains, ff. 33, 34, an inquisition touching the rents and the diets or days' works of the bondmen of Elton for the year 1283, from which avc collect the following curious i*"], [52, "34 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. information. The convent kept certain arable and meadow lands in demesne, that is, in their own hands ; other portions they let to free tenants at fixed rents, and others in small parcels to bond men, persons in servile condition, at small rents, for render of certain articles of consumption in kind, and for performance of menial services. The rents were paid at various feasts and seasons, such as those of St. Michael, St. Martin, Ember in Advent, Purification, Ember after Ash- Wednesday, Annunciation, Easter, Pentecost, Trinity, St. Botolph, and Nativity of Virgin Mary. Their payments in kind were two hens and a cock at Michaelmas, forty hens at Christmas, two capons at Whitsunday, fourteen score and three eggs at Easter, besides a certain amount of feeding for pigs (pannagium), and a summage or corn-rent, amounting to forty quarters and two bushels, paid by eighteen servile tenants of the monastery in the following proportions: \u2014 Eight, three quarters each; eight, a quarter and two bushels each; and two, two quarters and one bushel each : the quarter then consisting of four bushels. An inquisition was taken in the church of Elton, on the Thursday after the feast of All Saints, a.d. 1283, by Robert de Bekyngham, the steward of the convent, respecting the menial services due from the bondmen of that place to the monks in cultivating and reaping the crops of their demesne lands, and in other and similar matters, when William de Pavely and Gilbert the bailiff (pr\u00e6positus) declared upon oath, that every bovate occupied by the bondmen owed two days' works in every week, in one week on Monday and Thursday, and in another on Monday and Saturday : that two bovates owed four days' works on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday : if any of those days between Michaelmas and Lammas was a festival it was excused, but from Lammas to Michaelmas another day was to be given instead. Further, they made return, that every bovate owed the ploughing of half an acre, for which one day's work was remitted; and the* harrowing, weeding, reaping, and carrying of the same (trahare, sarculare, metere, cariare), for each of which half a day's work was remitted. Every bovate had to harrow one day in the time of wheat and another in time of peas or barley, and to carry to Blyth three times a year half a quarter of corn each time \u2014 the winter carriage standing for three days, the summer for two days. Again, he who held one bovate found half a cart, he who held two bovates a whole cart, to lead wood out of Shirewood Forest in winter \u2014 such leading standing for a day's work. Every bovate owed the leading of half a cart of hay from Thorp and as much from the gore of Garnemer: and among the menial services haymaking on the demesnes of the priory at Elton was included. Every free tenant was bound to provide two labourers for three days in harvest and to keep them well to their work. From a document presently to be introduced, viz., an \" extent \" or statement of receipts and expenses of the convent, made in 1379, we obtain a further and similar view of the Elton tenants and of the nature of free and servile tenures in the fourteenth century. VI. Becton, or Boughton, in Nottinghamshire, is given by Builli. This place is near Ollerton. It appears to have comprised before the Conquest two distinct manors, one of which the estate of Earl Edwin, came to Builli; the other, that of Ulf, fell to Gilbert de Gant. In the Nomina Villarum it is stated that the Prior of Blyth holds the whole vill of Bou\u00b0*hton in pure alms, of the fee of John Burdon of the new enfeoffment ; new as distinguished from the original grant to Builli or Gant. The Burdons were sub-infeudatories of the Gant fee at Maple beck, and appear to have been settled there from early times. They were benefactors to the"], [53, "35 POSSESSIONS ANMMD PRIVILEGES OF THE CONVENT. neighbouring abbey of Rufford; and William Burdon, Prior of Blyth from 1273 to 1303, and a very active and efficient prior too, was a member of this family. Sir John Markham, whose first wife had been Elizabeth Cressy, married for his second wife Melicent, the widow of sir Nicholas Burdon, who fell in the battle of Shrewsbury, 4 Henry IV.; and the manor thus came to the Markham family. Aeliz, daughter of William de Bucton, or Boughton, widow of John Burdon, lord of Maple beck, gave to the convent of Blyth the advowson of the church of Boughton and lands there. Her son and heir, John Burdon, in the year 1224, confirmed his mother's grants in the court of Tickhill. Basilia, his sister, had, by bequest of her mother Aeliz, a culture of forty acres in the fields of Boughton, between the field of Walesby and the lands of Rufford Abbey, and stretching from the road between Ollerton and Walesby to the road between Ollerton and Boughton, which she gave to the monks of Blyth, and which was confirmed to them by her daughter Amabilia, who had been wife of Ingram Bluet. The convent of Blyth made no appropriation of this church. By some means, not clearly apparent, the appropriation was made by the chapter of Southwell. The temporal possessions of the monks here are described in the old surveys as consisting of about 106 acres of land, which were let probably on lease for 20 shillings a year. VII. The manor and lands of Builli in Barn by Moor. Of these more will be said under that township. VIII. The tithe of twenty-three teams on his own demesne lands (mei proprii laboris). The grammatical construction of this part of the charter would warrant us in conceiving that these arc enumerated from Wateleia (Wheatley) down to Crokeston, and the aggregate does not differ materially with the amount above given; and yet there is a variation in the language when we come to \" partes decim\u00e6 aul\u00e6,\" which seems inconsistent with this supposition. Taking the charter as it stands, this portion of it gives the monks the tithe of twenty-three teams of his own labour, two of which are in Wheatley and two and a half in Marnham, both of which places are in the county of Nottingham. Then we have in Appleby, in the county of Lincoln, one of Roger's manors, two parts of the hall tithe in old cultivated ground, in newly reclaimed lands, and in all minute tithes (in terris et in essartis et in omnibus minutis decimis), that is, in fact, two parts of the tithe of the crops and fruits stored for the consumption of the manor house. In Laughton-en-le-Morthing, in Yorkshire, and near Tickhill Castle, the same two parts of the hall tithe are given. It has been already stated that Earl Edwin had an aula and an extensive territory here, which fell to Builli. Henry I. shortly after resuming the honour of Tickhill into his own hands, that is, before 1108, gave the church of Laughton to the canons of York. Arch bishop Gerard, who died in 1108, granted them an appropriation. It was therefore ii priori probable that the canons of York, and the convent of Blyth, possessing as they did by gift of their founder an interest in the tithes of this parish, would come into collision with each other. And such was the fact, for in the Blyth chartulary, f. 123, we have two charters from Beauclcrc, f 2"], [54, "36 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. expressed with a brevity and a decision quite in keeping with his character, which I give in the original language in which they were drawn up. 1. \"H. Rex Angli\u00e6 Ger. Archiepiscopo, et Osberto Vice comiti, et Helgoto Vice comiti, et omnibus Baronibus Francis et Anglis de Euerwiksira et de Notinghamsira salutem. Pr\u00e6cipio vobis ut juste et cito faciatis habere Sanct\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 de Blyda et monachis suis decimam suam de Lestona, sicut melius habuerant, et si aliquis eis injuriam faciat, tu, Osberte, sac eis rectum.

Et ita teneant sicut Rogerus de Bully eis concessit et dedit. Et videte ne aliquid inde perdant. T. Rob. fil. Ham. et Waid. cap. apud Westmo.\" It would seem from these charters as if the canons had invaded the rights of the monks, over whom the king threw the mantle of his protection. In the reign of Henry III. they were again in controversy with the convent of Blyth, in the time of Stephen of St. Adrian, an Italian cardinal, who then held the living of Laughton; and the following was the compact made between the contending parties : \u2014 \" This is the composition finally made between the churches of St. Mary of Blyth and of All Saints of Lactone, in the time of Gilbert the prior of Blyth, and of Stephen of St. Adrian, deacon cardinal, parson of Lacton \u2014 John de Alatro, clerk, by special command then following in England the business of the said cardinal \u2014 upon a controversy moved between the said churches concern ing tithes in the parish of Lacton : to wit, that the church of Blyth shall receive two garbs or sheaves of corn of all the lands whereof the difference has arisen, and moreover from those places whereof she was formerly wont to receive, except of forty acres of land of the demesne of Anstan : to wit, in Airingrange and at the head of it in Kirkeflat twenty acres and a half, and in Hallecroft thirteen acres and a half, and in Wlpittewange and Peselands six acres, of which she was wont to receive two garbs, but henceforth she shall receive nothing, but the church of Lacton the whole. And likewise the whole of all lands of which formerly she was wont to receive the whole, and the third garb where she was wont to receive the third. In witness of which composition the said prior and the said proxy have set their authentic seals to this writing. Done at Lettewell in the year of our Lord 1224.\" Eventually the prior of Blyth consented to receive an annual pension of 21. from the parish, which the convent enjoyed accordingly at its dissolution, and which since that time has been paid to Trinity College, Cambridge. The rectory of Laughton is appropriated to the chancellorship of York Cathedral and the vicarage is in the gift of that officer. It is not surprising that misunderstandings should have arisen as to the rights conferred upon the monks of Blyth by their founder in this parish, when such vague phraseolooy as \" du\u00e6 partes decim\u00e6\" is considered.** * A grant made to the Abbey of Abingdon, cited by Selden, Hist, of Tithes, p. 301, seems to indicate that the tithe in question was divided into three parts, \" Turoldus decimam earuc\u00e6 su\u00e6 tantummodo ita discrevit, ut duas istius decimationis partes huic loco, tertiam vero partem MPresbytero sibi servienti, concederet.\""], [55, "37 POSSESSIONS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE CONVENT. In Clifford the same grant is made as in Laughton. By Clifford I conceive is meant North Clifton, about twelve miles north-east of Newark, in which Builli had an interest. In Bingham, in the south of Nottinghamshire, the same grant. Bingham, as we have already seen, was a manor of Builli of high value and in an advanced state of cultivation at the time of Domesday. Before the Conquest Tosti, Hoge, and Helga had been lords: after that event, the place came entirely to Roger. The Paganels were the next lords, one of whom, Fulc, enfeoffed Hugh de Bingham and John de Cruce. Henry III. in 1266 granted the fee to Ralph Bugge, whose son Sir Richard de Bingham was a party to the following transaction. The convent of Blyth instituted proceedings in the spiritual court of York against Robert the rector of Bingham for leading away in 1280 the tithes of the sheaves growing on the ancient demesne of sir Ralph de Bingham and his ancestors, which they claimed by virtue of their endowment by Builli. The suit was terminated in 1284 with the consent of sir Richard de Bingham the patron, on the under standing that the rectors should in future pay the monks a yearly rent of four marcs for their tithes. The payment appears in the Taxation of Pope Nicholas.* In Saltby the same grant as in Bingham. Saltby is in the county of Leicester, and not far from Melton Mowbray. In the transcript of return 26 Henry VIII. in the First Fruits Office, we find that the abbot of Croxton, a Pr\u00e6monstratensian abbey in the same county, and not far from Saltby, paid the monks of Blyth 5s. annually for Saltby, of which therefore Croxton Abbey doubt less had the appropriation : and that the vicar of Saltby also paid them the same pension. In the transcript both Saltby and Croxton arc stated to be in the county of Lincoln. They are on the very edge of it, and hence the error. In Garthorpe, also in the county of Leicester, and in the same locality. And in Bersaldebey, which I cannot identity with the modern name of any place, the same benefactions are given as in Laughton. In Bridgeford, Loudham, and Gunthorp, all in the county of Nottingham, the same tithes are given again. In Clipston the tithe of one team. And finally in Croxton two parts of the tithe Such was the foundation charter and such the original endowment of the Benedictines of St. Mary of Blyth. It would be only natural that the great tenants whom Roger subinfeuded, or their descendants, should feel an interest in the infant establishment of Blyth, which their lord paramount had founded. And accordingly we shall find in the sequel that Thorald and Fulc de Lizours and their descendants and representatives were considerable benefactors to the convent. The grants made to the monks by persons either resident in or connected by property with the parish of Blyth will be found detailed under the several townships in which such proprietors resided, or with which they were so connected. More distant benefactions were * This clause of the ancient charter of Builli is omitted in the old edition of the MMonasticon, as well as in the modern one. The editors of the latter had access to the Harleian Library, where they might have found the charter correctly given in the Blyth Chartulary j but probably they preferred the easier method of extracting the deed from the original edition. This is not the only charge which 1 could bring against the editors of the modern edition of the MMonasticon Anglicanum."], [56, "38 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. IX. The Church of Weston, in the county of Nottingham. \u2014 Here also we see indi cations of sympathy with Builli and his monastery at Blyth. For Weston was one of his manors, which he parcelled out among Fulc, Thorald, and Robert, his Norman tenants, Robert was succeeded in his estate here by Gerbert de Archis, lord of Grove, the head of his barony, in the reign of Henry II. Gilbert de Archis in 1182 succeeded his father Gerbert. He gave to the monks of Blyth the church of Weston, and his son Gilbert confirmed his father's gift. Between Gilbert the son and the convent there was an agreement made that on the next vacancy of the benefice they should present Humphry de Tickhill, the priest of Austerfield, if then alive, or some other fit clerk, on the nomination of Gilbert.* Humphry accordingly succeeded to the rectory: and after him followed R. de Caneton. On the institution of the next incumbent, Ralph de Wad worth, Walter Grey, archbishop of York, by an instrument dated at the palace of Scrooby, June 10, 1250, reserved out of the rectory five marcs annually to the monastery of Blyth in aid of hospitality. The living, like that of Elton, had a narrow escape from appropriation. In fact Arch bishop Roger, the immediate predecessor, save one, of Walter Grey, had actually granted the monks appropriations both of Elton and Weston. But, as already intimated with reference to Elton, the measure was not carried into effect. Neither was it effected in the case of Weston. The monks obtained we see an annual pension of 31. 6s. 8d. which was paid regularly out of the rectory till the dissolution of their house, and was thenceforth continued to the Master and Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, by whom it has been handed over to the successive vicars of Blyth, originally doubtless with a view to improve the benefice, which three centuries ago was of very little value, and which even at the beginning of the last century received a grant from the bounty of Queen Anne. The rectory of Weston is now in the gift of Earl Manvers. X. Elksley, in the county of Nottingham. \u2014 Lands were given here to the convent by Adam de Wellum. He held estates at Elkesley under John Fleming, or le Flemangh, a member of the Norman family of that name (one of whom, Thomas Fleming, was the founder of Welbcck Abbey in the reign of Henry II.), by service of presenting to him and his heirs a Lincoln spur annually at Christmas; and he gave to the convent the whole meadow which was situated between the mill of Elksley and Bierkelont, by consent of his heirs, for the health of his soul and of the souls of his father and mother ; of Eve, his first wife, the mother of his children ; and of Orenta, his second wife. Galfrid, son of Rainald de Kirketon, gave to the monks one selion, which lay the fourth from the court of the said monks in Elksley on the west. Gerbert de Elksley gave them three dales of his land in Elksley, one dale in Tunfurlang, one beyond the chimin (road) to the castle, and one between that chimin and the chimin of Twiford. XL Billingley, in the parish of Darfield, and county of York, was held by Fulc * Gilbert was evidently determined to have the patronage in his own hands. His descendants were more manageable, for his grandson, Robert de Hersin, released to Theobald the prior of Blyth, in or about 1255, all right in the advowson of the rectory of Weston, for which the convent gave him and his heirs a share in all orisons henceforth to be done and offered in their church."], [57, "39 POSSESSIONS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE CONVENT. Lizours under Builli. He gave the monastery half of this place; and his donation was confirmed by his son Robert; by Albreda, the daughter of Robert; and by her son John, the constable. Thorald, the brother of Fulc, gave them also all he had in Billingley, on condition that they found a priest in their church of Blyth to serve perpetually for the redemption of the souls of himself, his parents, and friends. These grants were made early in the twelfth century. XII. Whatton, in the county of Nottingham. \u2014 About the same period Sir William de Watun, tenant, under the house of Gant, of this manor, gave a benefaction to the convent, which was confirmed by his successors, the Newmarches. We return nearer home to XIII. The churches of Bawtry and Austerfield, in the west riding of the county of York, which were given to the convent by John de Builli in the reign of Henry II. Idonea, his daughter, who married Robert de Vipont, confirmed her father's gist. XIV. Harworth, in the county of Nottingham. \u2014 Ralph Fraser, the king's marshal, gave the monks two bovates which Gamcl held of him in Harworth. Elias de Moles gave them the land which Hamo Buche held under him by annual rent of 10(Z., and that which Elyas Pin held for the rent of 2&d., and pasture for two hundred sheep in Farworth, in this parish, und common pasture. Peter son of William de Marton (now Martin) gave them one carucate and timber in his wood to make lodging apartments for poor travellers (herbergagia) and firewood, as well as a tost and free multure in the same place; for which gifts they promised to receive him as a monk when God should put it into his heart to offer himself. These, with other endowments subsequently to be detailed under the different townships of the parish, constituted, if not all, at all events the great portion of the possessions of Blyth Priory. I append a few charters and other deeds, which may not be without an interest, and then shall proceed to notice the royal confirmations of the monastic grants and the surveys of its income, whether spiritual or temporal. Hugh de Hedun, son of Fulc, gave the monks \" one measure of wheat, which we call an acrased of Blyth [as much as would set or sow an acre], to be rendered by him and his heirs annually at the feast of St. Katharine, virgin and martyr (Nov. 25).\" Richard del Pech (of the Peek in Derbyshire), son of Ralph sheriff of Nottingham, 5 shillings yearly at Martinmas out of the land which Hugh the chaplain (cornctsarius*) and his heirs held of him and his heirs in Cestcrfield (Chesterfield). Matilda, the daughter of Henry of Winchester, with the consent of Richard de Lindesey, her husband, \"the meadow which adjoins that bovate of land which came to me in Blyth of the estate of Hugh my brother \u2014 this grant I made to the monks on the day on which they took me as a sister (susceperunt me in sororem).\" * Cornetarius, canonicus, capellanus, k corneta, capitis tegumento in cornu formain desinente, dictus. This is the explanation given by Ducange of a word which bears the nearest resemblance that can lie discovered to that of the text. Perhaps it simply means horn blower, huntsman."], [58, "40 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. This lady had been a benefactor to the monks, and in return they took her into spiritual sisterhood, that is, gave her the benefit of their prayers and other religious offices. It was a common practice with the religious houses to grant letters of fraternity and sisterhood to eminent persons who had deserved well of them. Thus the convent of Durham granted such to Anne duchess of Gloucester, in 1475; to John de Warren, earl of Surrey, \"qui cum sit de semine regali et inter potentissimos a latere Regis, tantam dignitatem oblitus et generis nobilitatem, orationibus pauperum Christi et suffragiis ecclesi\u00e6 se commendat;\" to the lady Joan, widow of sir Richard de Byngham, knight, in 1392; to Thomas duke of Exeter, in 1426; to the abbess and convent of Sion, in 1517. They tell the duchess of Gloucester in their Litera Sororitatis, \" vestram excellentiam pr\u00e6potentemque personam in sororem, si placeat, spiritualem nostri Capituli Dunel mensis, cum ea qu\u00e6 decet reverencia duximus admittendam ; quam et admittimus per pr\u00e6sentes.

This man was a copyholder under the convent. Alan, the son of Alan of Blyth, living in London, quit claims to the monks a toft, with the buildings on it, which he held of them in Blyth, between the toft of Robert de Langold and that which belonged to the late William Cocth, reaching from the king's highway going through the middle of Blyth to the land of the late W. Cocth aforesaid. Dated at Blyth a.d. 1283. Royal Confirmations. Henry I. in two charters already cited, confirmed to the convent their tithes in Laughton. In another letter, addressed to and attested by the same persons as in the case of the first of those just referred to, the same king confirmed their tolls and passage, exempting, however, \"mercatores curi\u00e6 me\u00e6 qui brevia mea habent et burgenses mei de novo burgo* qui affidare poterint quod sunt mei homines.\" Again, in another letter dated at Blyth, and directed to R. Bigot and Osbert the sheriffs, and Richard FitzGotson, he confirmed their tithes and customs as they held them in the time of his father (so the letter runs) and his brother, and especially the tithes of Appleby and Assinton: and lastly, he commands Archbishop Thomas of York, 1108 \u2014 1114, to afford them peaceable enjoyment of their own, and protection (manuteneas viriliter), and to refrain from making any charge upon them for synodals or chrism. King Stephen, in the next reio-n, con firmed the endowments of Builli, and specially the tithes of Rocheston; as also their tolls, exempting only his court merchants; and exempted their demesne property from toll, passao*e, and custom (lestagium), under penalty of 10/. against any one who should disturb them. Henry II. * I strongly suspect that by novus burgus Tickhill is meant. Vide supra, p. 21, note."], [59, "41 ROYAL CONFIRMATIONS. confirmed their rights of fair, market, and toll ; their customs in the Wood of Lindric ; and all their liberties in wood, land, water, and other matters, with all tithes, as they enjoyed them in the reigns of Stephen and Henry I. He further forbids the tenants of the priory from appearing at the shire and hundred courts, and from pleading, except \" ad castellum de Blida.\" If their rights are withholden, or injury done them, the justices and sheriffs are to see justice done, \" ne inde clamorem audiam pro defectu recti.\" This deed is dated at Blyth, and attested by Thomas the chancellor, Ralph de Broc, and others. Thomas the chancellor was none other than Thomas Becket, the illustrious Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered, as is known to every one, in his own cathedral, on Tuesday, December 29th, 1170. Ralph, or Ranulph de Broc, at whose castle of Saltwood, near Canterbury, the assassins concerted the murder, had by acts of violence and hostility so far provoked the anger of the primate that he excommunicated him, with others, in the cathedral on the Christmas Day preceding. Another member of the same family, Robert de Broc, prohibited the monks from interring the body of Becket among the tombs of the archbishops, and threatened it with every conceivable indignity, as a fit recompence for the corpse of the king's enemy. What a contrast this most attrocious assassination presents to the calmness and peace of Blyth, in whose convent and church Becket and Broc had formerly met and worshipped as friends and brethren.* John, when earl of Morton, charges the sheriff of Nottinghamshire and his bailiffs of tin honour of Tickhill to protect the monks and all their possessions as confirmed to them by the charters of king Henry bis father and king Henry his great-grandfather. The letter is dated at Kingsbaugh. Taxation of Pope Nicholas IV. This was made in 1291-2, with a view to the payment of the tenths of ecclesiastical benefices to Edward I. for six years, being a grant to him from the Pope in aid of an expedition to tin- Holy Land.

III. to the Barons of the Exchequer, authorising them to reinstate the alien houses in the possessions which his father had taken into his own hands on occasion of the war between him and the King of France in the duchy of Aquitaine. In this instrument it is described as \" a cell of the Abbey of St. Katharine in Rouen in Normandy;\" and in the same manner the foreign ecclesiastic, whom it acknowledged as its superior, is in a charter of William Cressy of Hodsock, as well as in a letter of Archbishop Godfrey de Ludham to Prior Theobald, dated at Scrooby, March 2, 1260, entitled the Abbot of St. Katharine. If the pension of 40s. reserved by Builli in his foundation charter was designed by him, as is probable, for the abbey at Rouen, there is some confusion in the title of this foreign house, for the charter directs the pension to be paid to the church of Holy Trinity; but perhaps Roger intended the pension for the cathedral there, and not for the monastery, or possibly the latter was known indifferently by the names both of Holy Trinity and St. Katharine. The alien priories were numerous. They were to be found not only at Blyth, but at Lenton, Pontefract, Monks' Kirkby, Long Eennington, St. Neot's, Thetford, Ware, Newport Pagnell, York, Northampton, Abergavenny, Lancaster, and at other places \u2014 the richest of all being at Spalding, and founded by Ivo Talbois. In the age immediately subsequent to the Conquest our great barons were in the habit of giving manors with or without priories upon them to foreign religious houses, which, in the latter case themselves founding cells, in both cases made such cells dependent upon themselves to a greater or less degree. We learn from Tanner that the Abbot of Mountsburgh in Normandy had a stall in Salisbury Cathedral in right of his cell of Lodres in Dorsetshire, the manor of which had been given to his abbey by Richard de Redveriis, temp. Hen. I. In all cases, except in times of war, the foreign houses, to the reign at least of Henry IV., appointed the priors and monks of these dependent cells, received from them rents or pensions, and exercised powers varying with the nature of the foundation. It would appear that the foreign abbeys carried their claims to extreme and unjustifiable lengths; for Pope Lucius, whether Lucius II. 1144-1145, or Lucius III. 1181-1185, is uncertain, issued a bull to the Prior of Blyth, strictly forbiddmg any one from removing him from his office, or appropriating the possessions of his church. Again, in 1260 the Archbishop of York tells Prior Theobald that he has heard that he is intending, at the command of the Abbot of St. Katharine, Rouen, to quit Iris priory and go beyond the sea; and he strictly charges him, inasmuch as he is perpetual, under pain of excommunication, not to desert his priory at the bidding of any abbot whatever without his special licence. When England was at war with France, or in any way mixed itself up with the military"], [65, "47 CONSTITUTION OF THE CONVENT. transactions of that country, the priories alien were objects which excited the jealousy and rapacity of the Crown. Edward II. seized their lands, advowsons, and other possessions, for which he compelled them to pay rents. Edward III. in the first year of his reign, 1327, restored their estates, reserving however for his own use all pensions hitherto paid to the foreign houses; but at a more advanced period of his reign he also seized their property; for I find that in 1343 he was holding the priory of Blyth, and in that year, as well as in 1348, and again in 1351, appointed his own vicars. Richard II. adopted the same policy. Prior Nicholas English in 1388 petitioned the king and the parliament against John Middleton, alleging that, whereas he was perpetual, and instituted and inducted by the Archbishop of York, this person had obtained letters patent for the purpose of ejecting him, and selling the property of the convent, and praying that the letters might be revoked, and himself reinstated. In the next reign the House of Commons petitioned Henry IV. in 1402 to resume all alien priories except those which were conventual, with their lands, tenements. rents, and advowsons, into his own hands. In consequence of this the Prior of Blyth, with the Priors of St. Andrew at Northampton, Abergavenny, Holy Trinity at York and Monmouth, were summoned before the Privy Council, January 20th, 1403, and proved that they were conventual. Henry IV. in 1409, 1 find appointed the Prior of Blyth, the monastery then being in his hands in consequence of the share he was taking in the public proceedings of France, and the appoint ment to the priorate continued henceforth in the Crown down to the dissolution of the house. The priories alien were of two kinds: \u2014 1. Dative. 2. Conventual. The prior and monks of the former were removable at the discretion of the foreign houses to which they owed allegiance, and for which they acted merely as stewards of the revenues of their priories. The superior and brethren of the latter acknowledged a species of feudal superiority in the foreign convents, but were perpetual, and enjoyed their own endowments. Blyth Priory came under the second head. During the wars between England and France the revenues of these houses, as I have stated, were with their preferments seized by the Crown, and restored again when hostilities ceased. Richard II. and Henry IV. are however said not only to have detained the possessions of some of them in time of peace, but even to have bestowed them on their courtiers. In the fourth year of Henry V. all alien houses not conventual were dissolved, and granted to the Crown; the rest survived till the reign of Henry VIII. The Establishment of which Blyth Priory consisted, and its Expenditure. In the last chapter we had occasion to make an extract from the report of the commissioners who sat at Nottingham in 1379 touching the revenues of the convent of Blyth. At that time Richard II. held possession of it, and appointed the vicar. A minute statement was drawn up both of its revenues and outgoings, with a view doubtless of enabling the Crown to determine at what rent it should permit the convent to hold its estates. From this document or \" extent\" we are thus furnished with a full and interesting account of the establishment and expenditure of the priory, which I here lay before my readers. The jury say that There is in the priory a foreign monk, late prior, who from old age and infirmities resigned his office, and is allowed by the ordinary for meat and drink as much as two monks, amounting to 121. 17s. 9d. annually. The late prior is' allowed fire and candle and other necessaries for his chamber, together with meat and drink for a servant, all which come to 21. 6s. 8d. a year."], [66, "48 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLTTH There are also two chaplains ministering in the church, who have for yearly stipends, with table and robes, 81. Also one clerk ministering in the same church, whose food and clothing come to 20s. yearly. Also the vicar has from the priory, in money and in one quarter of wheat, valued at 4s., with places for himself and his chaplain at the prior's table at twenty-four festivals in the year, valued at 12s., what altogether amounts to 1Z. 16s. yearly. Also a clerk serving the present prior and his house in all matters which concern it, who receives for his fee 11. 6s. 8d. His table, with 10s. for his robe, comes to 21. 10s. yearly. Also a steward of the court is paid 21. per annum, and his clerk 20s. ; their table on court days amounts to 20s. Richard Bolevile, serjeant at arms, has 13s. Ad. a year by letter of the prior and convent Robert do Morton has a corrody, which he purchased from Henry de Rodes, worth 2l. 13s. id. Matilda, the wife of Robert of Esyngwolde, has for her life Id. a week, which amounts to 1/. 10s. 46?. a year. She has also daily from the convent an allowance of wheaten bread and s'jantis (?) worth Id., and a bottle of beer valued at Id., which amounts to 31. Os. Ad. a year, and a house to lodge in worth 6s. 8d. a year. Robert de Stansale has a corrody worth per annum 21. 7s. 8d. Alice the widow of Peter Monk has a corrody worth 21. 13s. Id. William de Kelum and his wife, Thomas Halyfax, and Thomas de Stanelay have four equal corrodies, to wit, each of them one corrody, valued at 10Z. 13s. 4J. per annum. Thomas Auneray has a corrody worth 21. 16s. 8d. There is also a cook, to serve as well for the prior as for hospitality to visitors, whose board and wages amount to 21. 10s. A servant to the cook, whose board and clothing come to 13s. Ad. A baker with his servant, whose board and wages come to 51. 14s. 3d. A forester, whose board and wages with his robe amount to 21. 10s. A servant of the present prior attending him on horseback in his business, who receives for wages and robe \\l. 3s. Ad. yearly. A butler, whose board, wages, and robe come to 21. 10s. The prior moreover pays yearly to the bailiff of the honour of Tickhill, in the wapentake of Bersetlowe, for a common fine due to the said honour, 20s. ; to John Burdon, Nicholas Monbocher, and the abbot of Roche, for Boughton, Barnby, and Blyth, in rent, 6s. 8d. ; to the Archbishop of York for his procuration 10s.; to the proctor of the lord Pope 7s.; to the Archdeacon of Not tingham for his visitation 7s. 6d. Expenses of hospitality yearly \\0l. Also there is expended the yearly sum of 211. 10s. in the sustentation of the present prior, his servants, horses, and other necessaries, together with 161. for his expenses in travelling to and from London and other places on the business of the priory. Also \\ll. a-year is expended upon the repairs of the chancel of Blyth church, the windows of the chancel, the houses and granges of the priory, and Blyth bridge, with the repair of the books, robes, and other ornaments of the church, wax, oil, and other necessaries. To the prior's proctor at Bawtry, for taking charge of the mortuaries there, a quarter of wheat, 4s."], [67, "CONSTITUTION OF THE CONVENT. 49 Domestic Arrangements and Daily Life of the Convent. I will endeavour to give my readers as distinct and accurate a conception as my limits will permit of the daily life and occupations of the Benedictines of Blyth. The cemeteries of the parish and convent occupied the entire south and east sides of the church ; the monastic buildings principally the north. These were, the cloister adjoining the church, the north wall of which in fact formed one of its sides ; the refectory and dormitory, immediately connected with the cloister ; the chapter-house, opening out of the north transept; the prior's apartments, camera prioris, the kitchen, cellar, and crypts, and guest-hall for the entertainment of strangers, all standing on the site of the present Blyth Hall, and the granges, granaries, dovecote, stables, and other buildings, at a little distance in the almry croft (the almoner's croft), as it is to this day called. The establishment was comprised within small bounds. In the time of Richard II. we find but two monks and a clerk officiating in the church. The great monastery of Durham, in the century after this, had thirty-three monks and seven novices, so that Blyth, by comparison, stood no higher than a cell of the splendid priory of St. Cuthbert. The Benedictine Rule was the great parent stock from which all other institutes were offshoots, and in its earlier and better days Blyth, like other houses, presented, I am deeply persuaded, a model of self-denying, charitable, and religious life. The still hour of midnight, the rising, and midday, and setting sun, all alike bore witness to the devotions of the convent in their house of prayer. The monks of Durham, as we learn from a singularly interesting volume, entitled \" The Rites of Durham,\" published by the Surtees Society in 1842 * (and their customs were substantially the customs of the Benedictines elsewhere), dined at eleven in the morning at a common table in the refectory, at which the sub prior presided; after dinner they retired to the centry garth (the cemetery garth), where they spent some time in prayer for their departed brethren ; they then returned to their small wainscoted studies or carrclls in the cloister till three o'clock in the afternoon, when they went to even-song ; that ended, they assembled for supper in the refectory, which was presided over, like dinner, by the sub-prior ; and at five o'clock retired to the chapter-house, where they met the prior, and all remained in prayer till six, at which hour the religious office of Salvi was celebrated in church, and the doors of the cellar, fratcr-house or refectory, dorter or dormitory, and cloister, were locked and the keys delivered to the sub-prior until six next morning. The monks retired early to rest, and at midnight rose and went to church for the midnight service. After an interval of three or four hours matins, and in due course breakfast, and the morning mass followed, and dinner came again. To the quiet and even tenour of monastic life at Blyth was almost daily given something of healthy, although not often exciting, novelty, by the arrival of mendicants and poor travellers, for whom a guest-hall would be provided, with an officer or hostillarius, as he was called, whose duty it was to supply them with becoming entertainment, or of travelling merchants with their goods and merchandise, or of tenants from their various estates with rents or produce in kind. Not unfrequently the monks had tidings of distant and splendid convents, such as Durham, Reading, and Glastonbury, when the breviators, as they were termed, came round, bearing briefs or letters * A considerable portion of this volume was published in a curtailed and modernised shape by John Davies, of Kidwelly, in 1672, under the following title, \" The Antient Rites and Monuments of the Monastical and Cathedral Church of Durham, collected out of Antient Manuscripts about the time of the Suppression.\" II"], [68, "50 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. from their houses to solicit the prayers of the religious throughout England for a departed bishop, or abbot, or prior. Every house attached its order and dedication to the roll, with the line, some times splendidly, sometimes indifferently, written, \" Vobis nostra damus, pro nostris vestra roga mus;\" and in so doing gave evidence that it felt and acknowledged itself to be the member of a family. On great days, such as the festivals of the Nativity and Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, their patron saint, and the commemoration of their founder and other benefactors, the convent distributed food and alms to the poor, and entertained at their table their more distinguished neighbours, both ecclesiastical and lay, such as the Abbot of Roche, the Prior of Worksop, Cressy of Hodsock, Moles of Serlhy, and especially Builli of Maltby and Vipont of Bawtry, both closely connected with their founder \u2014 the vicar of the parish and the rector of the hospital of Blyth not being forgotten. There were even times when they received royalty itself within their walls. In January, a.d. 1300, Edward I. was their guest, when he directed briefs to the sheriffs of counties commanding the merchants to supply provisions for his army at Carlisle. The tournaments of Blyth, \u2014 for near Blyth, as the reader will learn in a subsequent chapter, was a licensed tournament field, which was frequented by the great and noble, not only of this but of other countries, and the transactions in and around the neighbouring castle of Tickhill, espe cially such as sieges conducted in person by bishops of their church \u2014 transactions which made the very heart of England to beat with a quicker pulse, \u2014 could not fail to be objects of lively and thrilling interest to the retired ecclesiastics of Blyth Priory, at whose very gates almost the clang of arms rang, and on whose roads the pomp of military array or of courtly chivalry was on these great occasions exhibited. With these exceptions the fallentis semita vit\u0153 was indeed theirs. No wonder that in ancient times persons of the highest estate sought in the calm and peace of monastic life a refuge from a hard world. The buildings of the Priory of Blyth, with the exception of the church, itself most shamefully mutilated, and a portion of a crypt, have all been swept away. Everywhere in the village I see stones in the walls of houses and gardens, which by their very shape and mode of dressing tell in no ambiguous terms whence they have come, and to the wise say something more. What became of the site and demesnes of the priory shall be told in the succeeding pages. List of the Priors. 1.

Bubwith appears to have held the vicarage also from August 1462 to nearly the end of 1466. Edward IV. was then in possession of the priory, and I suppose Bubwith was glad to eke out the small pension which the king allowed him by taking the vicarage. He must have continued vicar aster he had resigned the priorate. 24. Robert Scotes, a monk of St. Mary's, York ; presented by Edward IV., and admitted October 9, 1465. 25. William Massam, a monk of Durham, was admitted August 7, 1472, being presented by the same king. How came the monks of Blyth to go so far for a prior ? Probably some brief bearer from Durham had visited Blyth Priory, and on inquiry being made if he could recommend them a successor to Scotes in the event of a vacancy, had named Massam ; or Massam himself had been at Blyth in that capacity and the monks had not forgotten him, or he had not forgotten the Priory of Blyth, when the vacancy actually occurred. By one party or other application was probably made to the Crown, and granted. The Convent of Durham were greatly attached to him, and the feeling was doubtless re- h2"], [70, "52 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. eiprocal. At the request of the convent the prior granted Massam leave to wear his monk's frock whenever he revisited the great Northern house, which was endeared to him by so many cherished recollections. Here is the licence at full length : \u2014 \" On the 30th day of the month of May, a.d. 1473, sixth indiction, second year of the ponti ficate of the most holy father in Christ and our Lord Sixtus IVth, by Divine Providence Pope, the venerable father in Christ, Richard, by Divine permission Prior of the cathedral church of Durham, having called before him certain of his brethren of the chapter in the chapel of St. Nicholas, situate near his apartments, declared publicly to the venerable and religious man William Massam, late monk and brother of the same church, professing the order of St. Benedict, and then and there present and standing by, that, although he, by accepting the priorate of Blyth, in the diocese of York, where, as is asserted, he is, with the consent of those who are concerned in the matter, law fully invested with and put in possession of the office of prior, has lost all and singular the rights of a brother in the aforesaid church with his own free consent, nevertheless the same venerable father, at the request of his brethren, and for the singular affection which he feels and ever hath felt for him, hath of his abundant kindness granted leave to the said William, that as often as he comes to the monastery of Durham as a stranger and visitor he may wear a frock like any other brother of the house, as long as he stays, without any molestation, provided that by so doing he make no claim to any other right, but conduct himself creditably among all the inmates. If he acts dif ferently (quod absit) he shall be deprived of the privilege.\" He died at Blyth, having been prior nearly twenty- four years. If it were possible William Massam would form one more link in that chain which binds the writer of these pages to Durham by the most affecting recollections and associations. 26. Robert Guillam, a monk of Blyth, succeeded Massam, and was admitted March 3, 1496, being presented by Henry VII. in right of the duchy of Lancaster. He died in the office, and was followed by 27. Thomas Gardener, a monk of Westminster, on the same presentation. He was admitted May 20, 1507. On a leaf in the beginning of the Blyth register, in the Harleian library, written in an indifferent hand, are these lines \u2014 r Pray for me now I am natt here, \u201e . \\ Of Blyeth sometyme prior, T.

On his death, George Dalton, a monk of Blyth, was instituted, on the same presentation, Nov. 26, 1534, and was in office when the fiat was issued for the surrender of his house. The religious houses have been at all times and in all countries fruitful in men of profound learning and erudition. In our own country Beda, Matthew Paris, William of Malmesbury, Regi nald, Symeon, Roger Bacon, Thomas Docking, William of Ware, John of London, Richard of Hampole; and abroad, Menard, Mabillon, Montfaucon, Massuet, Gerberon, Garnier, and Ruinart; have left a name and reputation behind them which the world will not suffer to perish. And"], [71, "53 THE CHURCH. doubtless our humble convent of Blyth, according to its means and opportunities, cultivated letters; but no member of the house achieved any public fame in the walks of literature, or attained any eminence in Church or State. They were probably content with the quiet and uniform discharge of unpretending duties, and found therein a happiness which is denied to the giddy and perilous heights of worldly distinction. The Conventual Church; The Parish Church. The church of Blyth, uniting formerly, like so many other churches, both a monastic and a parochial church under one roof, is but a remnant. It is what the hand of man, far more destruc tive than the action of time, has left us of an edifice once fair and goodly to contemplate within and without. In its original form it consisted of a nave, side aisles, transept, central tower, and choir terminating in an apse. Although much of this venerable church remains, yet much has been wantonly destroyed. The conventual choir, where for four centuries and a half prayer was daily wont to be said \u2014 that portion at least which passed through the transept and extended 60 feet beyond the present termination of the church into the present pleasure grounds of Blyth Hall, the central low Norman tower, the transept, have all been swept away, whilst one bay of the nave and one of the north aisle have been in an evil hour and by ill-advised hands severed from the church and applied to all save religious uses. I have not been able to discover in the pages of the Blyth register or elsewhere any fabric accounts of our church. Knowing however, as we do, the precise date of the foundation of the convent, having the church, so far as it goes, before our eyes, and possessing one or two inde pendent and corroborative documents, we are enabled to six the dates of the several portions of it with tolerable accuracy and precision. I believe, then, that the religious, immediately after their original foundation, a.d. 1088, commenced with a Norman apse, and proceeded consecutively with the choir, transept, central tower, nave, and aisles. The existing portions of the north aisle with its rude vault of rubble ; of the nave with its round arches, massive piers, cushion capitals, triforium, clerestory, and corbel table; and of the south wall of the transept; all harmonise with this date. The tirst change which the church, thus constituted, underwent was the substitution of an excellent early-English groined vault, with moulded ribs and elaborate bosses over the nave, for the original roof of wood. This took place about the year 1250. In the centre of the roof of each bay two ribs intersect each other at a boss, and the vault of the bay is completed by two transverse ribs. The work is light and elegant, and bears a strong resemblance to the vaulting of the nave of Durham Cathedral, and south choir aisle of that of Lincoln. The next change was the expansion of the south narrow Norman aisle for the purpose of forming a parish church. The earliest vicar of Blyth, the date of whose institution is on record, was, as we shall shortly see, William de Flecham, a.d. 1256. Pie was vicar for nearly forty years, and appears to have had a long dispute with the convent respecting the vicarial tithes, which was settled by a deed of endowment, bearing date 1287. Not long aster this the alteration in the south aisle was made. It was widened to the extent of the termination of the south wing of the transept ; the old round-headed opening between the transept and aisle was replaced by two more open and pointed arches, now blocked up ; and the windows inserted in the south wall, which exist at this"], [72, "54 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. day, and which, with the two arches just named and other features, harmonise with the date above assigned. The internal apertures of these windows are splayed from the sill to the springing of the arches; the upper portions are arched over the lights of the window with arches dying into the splayed jamb, with label mouldings and carved terminations. Henceforth the convent and the parish possessed each their own chancels, which in process of time were defined by two separate rood-lofts in a line with each other, crossing the nave and south aisle. The latter of these screens remains, and the painted figures which I have given at the end of the volume, and which were brought to light in 1842 from the boards and matting of pews, behind which they were concealed, may now be seen with sufficient distinctness, though with a few marks of puritanical violence; with the exception of that of St. Ursula, which was found in such a state of decay as to justify its removal to a place of safe preservation. Other figures on the panels of the parish rood-screen have been cut away to make a road to the reading-desk and pulpit. The rood-lost of the convent has fared worse. With the exception of a fragment at the corner of the private gallery of Blyth Hall and the lower panels, it has been destroyed; and, what is hardly less annoying, these panels, all perfect though they are, are daubed over with paint, so as com pletely to obliterate the figures, except at the very base. The next change which the church underwent was the construction of the present tower, which possesses great beauty, and is a striking feature both of the church itself and of the surround ing country. From an examination of the nave, both within and without, it is clear that a portion of it was taken down to make room for the tower, which at its two western angles, where it is not engaged in the wall of the nave, is flanked with buttresses of seven stages at right angles with the sides, is lighted with double-transomed belfry windows, and crowned with a remarkably light and elegant parapet, whilst its western door is decorated with crocheted canopy and buttresses pierced with panels, above which are three niches of good character, one elevated above the other two, containing in ancient times, we may presume, figures of our Lord, the blessed Virgin, and St. John the Evangelist, long since removed. The tower was built about the middle of the fifteenth century, and no work of any importance was done after it. Previous to the year 1841 the tower contained four bells; the first of which bore the inscription \"Jesus be our speed;\" the second, in black letter, \"Ioannes Baptista;\" the third, \"Benedicta sit Sancta Trinitas . Ioannes Cossale arte xpi composuit, a.d. m.ccccxxi;\" the fourth the date 1620. The third bell appeared to have been recast and was cracked, and ah of them to have been hung at different times ; in consequence of which they were not in harmony. In the above year they were therefore taken down, recast, and two additional bells made, by Mr. Taylor, bell-founder, of Oxford and Loughborough. The new ring of bells was received at Blyth on the 2nd September, 1842, preceded by a band of music, and accompanied to the church by the inhabitants, who exhibited the most lively demonstrations of joy on the occasion. I should do extreme violence to my own feelings, if I omitted to mention that for this great and much needed improvement the parish was very largely indebted to the zeal, the taste, and the liberality of two young gentlemen, then my pupils, now my friends, and one of them a most dear friend too ; who, although they have been gone from my roof for now nearly twenty years, are still remem bered by both rich and poor of this place with feelings of sincere respect and esteem. I mean Augustus and Henry George Sutton, sons of the late Sir Richard Sutton, of Lyndford Hall, Norfolk, and of Norwood, in the county of Nottingham, Baronet."], [73, "55 THE CHURCH. The tower once possessed chimes, which have disappeared many years ago. A brass tablet used to hang in the ringing loft with this inscription: \" This chime was made and set up by Tho. Kirkall of Sheafield. William Tomlinson and Gervase Mitton being churchwardens this present year 1686. Sexton, look to your charge. The work is good and large.\" The latest feature in the church is the Tudor window at the west end of the south aisle, which probably superseded one of smaller dimensions, like those in the south side of the same aisle. Ancient wills speak of guilds or fraternities of Corpus Christi and St. George, and a torch guild, to which legacies of money, corn, or land were frequently bequeathed; and of four principal lights, as well as probably of others, some of which were known by the names of Blyth Light, Strop (Styrrup) Light, the Plough Light, the Light of St. Sitha, and the Light of St. Bridget, to which also money was constantly left. I discover no vestiges of the existence of chantries. The parish possesses to this day lands in the townships of Blyth and Styrrup, the rents of which go to the general purposes of the church. They probably have a mixed origin, arising from legacies left \" fabric\u00e6 ecclesi\u00e6 \" to the fabric fund, to the guilds, and to the vicars, with a view to secure the performance of religious offices. Thus, so late as 1504, Thomas Hugh of Blyth settled an acre of land in Blyth on the vicars of Harworth and Blyth for ever, Ad. to be paid out of it yearly to the former to pray for him and his wives every Sunday, the remainder of the rent to go to the vicar of Blyth on the same conditions. Our ancient monuments have been treated with savage recklessness. Till within the last few years the western bay of the north aisle was walled off from the church, and coals deposited in it. On removing this wall we found it contained fragments of figures of knights in elaborately wrought chain armour, and of ecclesiastics in delicately carved drapery. And doubtless the church was, in times of old, very richly ornamented with the monumental effigies of great and good men, lay and ecclesiastical, some of whom had benefited, and all of whom had revered it whilst living, and whose dying wish it was that their bones should rest in peace under its sacred roof. But the destruction of the monasteries by a sensual, selfish, cruel tyrant, and the Reformation which followed \u2014 pro ductive of incalculable good in some respects though the latter was \u2014 undoubtedly poured a torrent of irreverence over the land, from the effects of which our sanctuaries are suffering to this very day. Thou jealous, ruthless tyrant ! Heaven repay On thee and on thy children's latest line The wild caprice of thy despotic sway, The gory bridal bed, the plundered shrine, The murdered Surrey's blood, the tears of Geraldine. One ancient monument alone remains perfect, a plain slab in the chancel, with this modest inscription, so exceedingly unlike the presumptuous bombast of modern days: \" Orate pro anima domini Iohannis Albarne quondam vicarii de Blida, qui obiit vicesimo sexto die mensis Junii, anno Domini M\u00b0CCCC0LXX\u00b0vi0.\" Of other slabs, and crosses, and inscriptions, numerous fragments, but only fragments, are to be seen. The stone coffin lid, of which I have given an engraving, was found in the church floor with its face downwards. The archbishops of York during their occasional residence at the palace of Scrooby, within"], [74, "56 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. four miles of us, would find the church of Blyth the only sufficiently large and convenient one in the neighbourhood for purposes of ordination, and would consequently \" celebrate orders \" in it. Thus in 1356 archbishop Thoresby, as we find from his register, held an ordination in our church \"die Sabbati quatuor temporibus proximo post festum sanct\u00e6 Luci\u00e6 virginis:\" that is, on the Saturday in the Ember week next after the feast of St. Lucy the virgin ; and conferred the four orders of sub-deacon, deacon, priest, and acolyte on persons not only of his own but of dioceses as remote and distant from each other as St. Andrew's, Lichfield and Coventry, Norwich, Carlisle, and Lincoln. Some were ordained ad titulum paupertatis, which was that of a monk; some ad titulum patrimonii sui, which was that of a man of a certain private income; and some ad titulum beneficii sui, that of a benefice. Some ad omnes ordines, that is, to all the minor orders at once of ostiarius, lector, exorcist, and acolyte, and to the major order of sub-deacon. Some to the orders of sub-deacon and deacon at once. Since the Council of Trent this ordination of a person as sub deacon and deacon on the same day has been discontinued in the Church of Rome, and intersticia, or an interval of twelve months, must transpire between the two. I now come to the destroyed, the severed, and the mutilated portions of our church. The external view and the ground plan will, with what has already been said, enable my readers to understand with sufficient, and I doubt not with painful, clearness the destruction and the spoliation which this sanctuary has undergone. The dotted lines in the ground plan indicate a transept and choir terminating in an apse, now destroyed. And here I must state that this part of the plan is not founded on mere inference, for on September 14, 1857, on being informed by the then <nirdener of Blyth Hall, an intelligent man, that he had discovered, in making a garden walk in the pleasure grounds east of the church, the foundations of a round wall, and on receiving from him an account of the precise situation of such foundations, I made a measurement from the spot occupied by the head of this round wall, which was doubtless the boundary wall of the apse, to the foot of the outer arch now in the hall garden, and found the distance to be 61 feet. In the same engraving the letters h H point out a bay of the nave and a bay of the north aisle severed from the church, and claimed by Mr. Walker as owner of Blyth hall. The external view of the church discloses a round arch at the east end, being one of the four upon which the central Norman tower rested. As the stranger advances up the churchyard of Blyth his attention is arrested by the singular appearance of the east end of the church. He sees a stately arch with a dark deep grotto-looking place behind it, commonly known as the Aviary \u2014 a name which explains itself. He further observes the eastern wall finished off at the top in two inverted semi-cycloid looking lines partly with modern tiles ; no eastern window ; and the eastern and northern sides of the church entirely cut off from the churchyard and the access of the parishioners by a wall built of stones, which from their very form and aspect prove that they came from the church or the monastic buildings. G Can any account be given of this scandalous and deplorable desecration ? To answer this question I must premise that the first lay settlers on the site of the ancient monastery planted them selves on a spot which, however convenient to them from foundations and walls already made to their hands, was far too near the church to be productive of anything but mischief to it. The Saundersons, and others before them, had since the Dissolution resided at Blyth Abbey, as the house was then called ; and it is only fair, although we cannot prove the fact, to suppose that they had some share in the work of destruction, by permitting, if not encouraging, dilapidation of the"], [75, "57 THE CHURCH. eastern portions of the church to go on. From the Saundersons the estate passed by purchase to the Mellishes in 1635. In 1684 Edward Mellish, the son of the purchaser, pulled down the old hall and built a new house. He kept a diary with full accounts of his expenditure, and in 1689 he tells us what the new house, with \" outhouses and walls about the grounds, repairing the church end, making the vault and pew in the church\" (I quote his own words), and other matters, had cost him. I cannot but think, then, that Edward Mellish, finding the church end as he calls it in a dilapidated state, for we must suppose that the conventual choir had fallen into disuse, really, although by a soft euphemism he speaks only of repairing, levelled to the ground the portion of the choir east of the transept, together with the transept and central tower ; that he severed the bay of the north aisle and the bay of the nave from the church, and turned them to secular uses ; cut off all approach to the eastern and northern sides of the church by a wall ; finished off the eastern end in the manner in which we now see it, and blocked up the lower windows of the north aisle, which happily were re-opened twenty years ago. Certain it is, for habemus comftentem reum, that he made the large family vault under the severed bay of the nave, and the pew, that is gallery, in the north aisle, cutting pier and capital and window in the most wanton manner, taking up one entire arch of the nave with his steps, projecting his \" pew\" far in advance into the nave through another arch, and establishing under it in the background a dark and dismal dungeon, which ever since his day has witnessed every detestable abomination. And now if any of my distant readers should ever enter Blyth church they will sec Edward Mellish reposing in effigy against the dead boundary wall of the nave, on his right arm, on a soft pillow, under elegant drapery, and an elaborate panegyric, quietly and complacently, as if utterly unconscious of having done any wrong to the sacred edifice. I have only to add, by way of completing my account of the desecration and mutilation of the church, that at some period subsequent to the spoliation of the convent the outer roof of the north aisle has been dropped beneath the openings of the triforium, and these openings have been turned into windows, the heads of the arches being blocked up with masonry. What adds to the sino-ularity of the whole is, that the ground under the aviary, now no longer I am glad to say used for the purpose implied by the name, is occupied by the vault of the Mellish family, which in my time has been three times opened for the interment of the dead; and that the roof a bo ve is repaired by the parish. I am constrained, by a sense of justice to myself, to state that this condition of things has always given me pain; that I have in season and out of season remonstrated against it; and that in the years 1853 and 1854 I began to persuade myself that I saw a restoration of the church, so far that is as it remains, in prospect. The patrons and rectors, Trinity College, Cambridge, very cordially seconded my efforts by undertaking to fill the great arch of the aviary with a window, to transfer the chancel from the south aisle to the nave, and to assist in carrying out the rest of the work. My parishioners many of them offered liberal subscriptions, and I was encouraged by the promise of aid from distant and eminent quarters. How and by whom this good work was defeated it boots not to tell. I was once disappointed and mortified ; I am now contented and resigned. Howbeit, aster a peaceable endurance of more than a quarter of a century, I feel entitled to state that I have been assured over and over again, by persons quite competent to offer an opinion upon the subject, that no length of time can give the claimant of the severed portion of our church a i"], [76, "58 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. title to the property \u2014 nay to add, that I can quite conceive that hereafter a vicar may arise who, unless it be spontaneously ceded, as is most devoutly to be wished, will be so indignant under the present state of things as to resolve to bring to an issue the question whether the laws of Christian England sanction such desecration. For myself, from seeling, I have been always unwilling to convert my church into an arena of strife. Other affecting considerations now invest it in my eyes with a character, humanly speaking, of still greater sanctity, and demand that none other save the accents of peace be ever heard within its walls. I can only express my most fervent prayer that the restoration may hereafter be again under taken under a better star and a more favourable combination of circumstances, and that, not content with a mere restoration of what remains, another generation will boldly and generously and vigorously advance to the still greater and better work of building up again the waste places of our Zion, of carrying the church out to its original eastern boundary, and internally of making it as perfect and beautiful as art can make it, since God hath no where (in the words of Hooker) revealed that He delighteth to dwell beggarly. Then, with a nave and chancel open from east to west, to the length of 160 feet, wherein to celebrate the sacred offices of religion, the fine old church of Blyth will indeed speak to the very innermost heart of both rich and poor, and become once more the admiration of the country. To be spoken of as having in any degree assisted as the pioneer in so good and pious a work will in that day be to my name and memory sufficient praise ; and then will one proof more be given that a beautiful sanctuary and a pure worship are most perfectly compatible and consistent with each other. The Vicarage. I have already remarked that the consecration of tithes to religious houses was not uncommon in England even before the Conquest. Thus a Dane gave the tithes of his demesne of Henreth to the abbey of Abingdon. The practice became more common after that event, inasmuch as convents rose in great abundance during the reigns of the four kings who in succession followed the Conqueror. The monasteries received, under the name of appropriations, from patrons both epis copal and lay, entire parishes; that is to say, the entire temporal endowments, together with the charge of all spiritual ministrations. As early as a.d. 1082 we find Carileph, Bishop of Durham, appropriating to his convent of that city in his foundation charter the churches of Elvet, Aycliff, Heselden, Dalton, Howden, Brantingham, and others. It is probable that for a time the religious would send first one and then another of their body to discharge the spiritual duties of their appro priated parishes; but the inconveniences of such an arrangement would soon suggest the obvious remedy of fixing a presbyter permanently in the parish, with a manse and endowment and perpetual succession. Thomas, Archbishop of York, the contemporary of Carileph, instructed the convent of Durham to place vicars in their churches, who should be responsible to him (so far as they were in his diocese) for the cure of souls, and to themselves for the temporalties. The earliest existing endowment of the vicarage of Blyth bears date in 1287. In this instru ment the vicar is called perpetual. He is, inter alia, to have a manse, as his predecessors have had and reference is made to some previous \" ordination.\" From all which circumstances we may conclude that a perpetual vicar had been in charge of the parish long before the date just mentioned. The document is important, and therefore I will give it at full length: \u2014"], [77, "59 THE VICARAGE. \" In the name of God, Amen. Whereas for some time a difference has arisen between the religious the prior and convent of Blyth of the one part and William perpetual vicar in the church of Blyth of the other, respecting certain tithes of sheaves of a place called Bettecroft in the town of Blyth, and of two cidtures of the manor of Hodesake, of a place called Hyldirtrewongs and le Conyngher, of which three places the tithes are computed one year with another at sixteen shillings ; and respecting the tithe-hay of a close called the Stubyngs, in the said manor, which is valued at two shillings; and respecting the tithe of wool and lambs of a certain place called Northenaye, which is on the north side of the bridge and water of Blyth, on the ground that the said place is not part of the town of Blyth, as the prior and convent allege, the vicar affirming the contrary, the tithes of which are valued at twenty-four shillings; \u2014 the dispute has at last, through the mediation of friends, been settled as follows, namely, that the said vicar, for himself and his successors, vicars in the aforesaid church, preferring the quiet of peace to the tortuous ways of contention, expressly consents and grants that from henceforth the prior and convent shall have, receive, and enjoy peaceably for ever the aforesaid tithes as their right and property, appendant to their rectory of Blyth; and the P. and C. for themselves and their successors have granted to the said vicar and his successors that he and his chaplain for the time being shall at twenty-four festivals in the year be robed with the convent in the choir at mass as the festival shall require, and shall on those days have honest refection with the P. and C. They further grant to the vicar and his successors one quarter of maslin yearly at the feast of St. Michael, and pasture for four cows in the places where their own cows are pastured. They further voluntarily and unanimously grant that the said vicarage shall for ever consist in the matters under written, as in an ordination on this point is more fully expressed, namely, in the tithe of hay of the town of Blyth, in the tithe of lambs or money given in lieu thereof, in the tithe of wool or money instead of it, except the tithes of lamb and wool in Northenaye, in oblations made on Sundays with the consecrated bread as well in the town of Blyth as in the chapels adjacent, in all the profits of the chapels of Bawtry and Austerfield except the tithe of grain and the mortuaries, in oblations at funerals, marriages, and churchings throughout the parish. There are excepted also from the vicar's portion the oblations at the five principal feasts, namely, Easter, the Assumption of the Blessed Mary, All Saints, Christmas, and the Purification, as well as those which arc offered at the altars of the monks within their rails on the festivals of the saints to whom they are dedicated, and those of missal pence, which are made to the monks out of devotion, saving to the said vicar and his successors the offerings named above. Furthermore, the vicarage is to consist in the bread which is called Maynport through the whole parish, in oblations of wax, and in such as come with children to be baptized and with their chrismals, in the tithes of pigs, chickens, geese, foals, calves, pidgeons, gardens, bees, apples, corn and hay of old inclosures, the places before named specially excepted, in the tithes of merchants and hired servants, of flax and hemp, in cerage (waxshot), in Lent eggs, in albo (that is white silver, an antient personal tithe levied upon the wages of all labourers and artificers, which were supposed to be paid in silver),* in other small tithes and profits, and other offerings throughout the entire parish, except those above specified. The vicar, moreover, and his successors, shall have a manse to dwell in with appurtenances, as the vicars before him have had; and observe, that the vicar for the time being shall serve the church of Blyth by himself or some other fit presbyter, and the two chapels of Bawtry and Austerfield by two other sit presbyters, and * See Whitaker' s Craven, 2nd edit. p. 177. I 2"], [78, "60 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. shall not be bound to bear any other burthen ; and he shall have from the prior yearly, eight days before Easter, a robe worth twenty shillings, or the\" money, at his choice. For the better observance of the premises both parties have given up all letters past and to come whereby they might defeat the said premises, or any of them, and all redress of man and law, canon as well as civil. The venerable father John, by the grace of God Archbishop of York and Primate of England, at the instance of the parties aforesaid, accepts and approves of this amicable composition, which is to be for ever binding, and which is entered upon two indentures, and has appended his seal with the seals of the parties to the same in witness of the premises, saving in all things the dignity of the church of York. Dated at Scrooby, July 21, a.d. 1287.\" Disputes again arose, for in 1346 we have an arbitration between the convent and vicar by the Archbishop of York at Scrooby, who, after calling the parties before him, and carefully examining the deed of 1287, decreed that oblations should stand on the old footing, the five great feasts being understood to last from the vigils before to the eves of the same ; thatall mortuaries, as well living as dead, should be paid to the vicar, except those of Bawtry and Austerfield; that he should have hay and corn tithe of a certain close called Finchcroft, and of all the closes of the aforesaid parish except as excepted in 1287, as also the tithes of the mills of Bawtry, Austerfield, and Olcotes, and of the underwood of Bawtry and Austerfield, of which he has already been in possession, of pannage (mast), agistment, fishing, and hunting, through the parish, except in the woods and places of the convent. The arbitration is intended as a supplement to the ordination, and is dated January 22, 1346. Incidentally we gather a few interesting facts from these documents. 1. Not one word is said about moduses. At a subsequent period exemptions from vicarial tithes, as well upon other places as especially upon the abbey lands, upon a certain district called Great Hodsock consisting of more than two thousand acres, upon the Spital containing more than six hundred acres, and upon Bilby consisting of nearly seven hundred acres, were pleaded on payment of the respective sums of six shillings, nine shillings and four pence, two pounds, and four shillings ; and in the case of the three last pronounced valid in law, that is, as old as the time of Richard I. If this had been really true, would not such moduses have appeared upon the face of the deeds of 1287 and 1346? And is not their absence conclusive moral evidence that they were then unknown? 2. The vicar is entitled to great tithes of all closes, that is old inclosures, throuo-hout the parish, with certain specified exceptions. In point of fact, however, he had, before the commuta tion of tithes, simply the great tithes of the tofts and crofts adjacent to the outlying villages of the parish, and in Blyth, in addition to such tofts and crofts, of a few fields scattered here and there in the township, chiefly however situate near Blyth Wood, or by the sides of the river between Nornay Bridge and Blyth Mill. The inference is, that at the date of the documents cited above the parish was very nearly all open and uninclosed. 3. We see that altars in honour of different saints were erected in the church, at which the monks offered mass. 4. The personal tithes of profits of merchants, servants' wages, and others, have lono* fallen into disuse. The vicarage in Pope Nicholas's Taxation is valued at \\0l. per annum.

A chaplain is mentioned, both in the endowment and in the survey of Richard II. who was permanently endowed by the parishioners for the purpose of assisting the incumbent in his extensive cure. In the survey of chantries for the county of Nottingham, made 37 Henry VIII. and now in the Augmentation Office, it is stated that, \" the stipendarie of Blythe is ordeyned by diverse men in consideracion that the parishe is large, and other foundacyon the incumbent hath not, but that he prayethe for all crystian soulcs and hclpethe the vycare to serve there;\" that he receives 66s. ; that \"Sir Thomas Twellys is stipendarie preste there; that the same is no parishe churche, but within the parishe churchc of Blithe, wherunto belongithe 400 howseling people (/. e. of age to receive the Holy Sacrament) havinge no more priests but the vicare and this stipendarie priest to mynistre there.\" Again, the survey of chantries 2 Edward VI. sets forth that \" the stipendarye of Blythe, founded by divers of the paryshioners ther to maynteyne a priest to sing masses there for ever, is worth by yere in landes, &c. in the said parish, 75s. I0d.; rents resolut', 5s. 8d. ; rents decayed, 8s. 4c.. ; and so remayneth yerely unto Thomas Twellys, chauntry prest there, of the age of 56 yeres, and unlcrned, having no other promocion, 61s. lOd.\" In another and somewhat earlier return than the first, in the General Record Office, made between the 31st and 37th years of Henry VIII. of the names of chaplains of churches and chapels whose stipends are not worth 81., with their benefices, a clear value, a third part, and a fifth of a third, I find Thomas Lokewod parochial chaplain of Blyth with an income of -11. 6s. 8d. The provision and endowment of this additional minister to aid in the duties of an extensive parish reflect the highest honour upon the piety and liberality of its ancient inhabitants. There are attached to the church of Blyth to this day lands the rents of which, amounting to about 201. a- year, are applied towards the liquidation of the general expenditure of the church. But even if these are a part they certainly are a part only of the landed endowment of the ancient stipendiary of Blyth, which producing as it did an annual rent of nearly 4.1. in the time of Edward VI., would in these days be worth from 80/. to 100Z. yearly. I fear that this estate was swept away like many others by a rapacious court, under the exceedingly convenient plea that it was a remnant of popery."], [80, "62 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. Well, and if it were so \u2014 if the church of our forefathers had become obscured and overlaid by objectionable tenets and practices, she might have been restored to her fair proportions without suck ing her life's blood. To say nothing of the monastic bodies and their possessions, it is incalculable what benefit would have accrued to the Church of England and what strength it would have given her to cope with the spiritual needs of an ever growing population, if the endowments of chantry and stipendiary priests had been lest intact and applied in furtherance of strictly parochial minis trations. I return to the Vicarage. A survey was made Aug. 27, 5th Elizabeth, and runs in these words: \" Edward Maude holds in right of the vicarage one tenement called the Vicarage, with a hall, parlour, chambers, kitchen, bakehouse, pantry, and other necessary houses, built of wood and covered with straw, with a barn, a stable, a croft, and a garden adjoining, containing in the whole by estimation half an acre, and lying between the churchyard path on the east and north, the land called the Abbey land on the south, and the land and river of Blyth on the west. The said Edward holds a tenement in Barnby with a chapel and the chapel yard, an orchard, a garden, and a croft, containing together by estimation three roods, now or late in the occupation of Thomas Barnbye, by the yearly rent to the vicar of twelve shillings. The aforesaid Edward holds two selions of land containing one acre of arable land lying upon Briberhill, between the land of William Pye on the north and the land of William Heynesworth on the south, and abutting upon the road leading to Hodsock Mill towards the east. The before-mentioned Edward holds an acre of land lying at Cunnsdale between the land late of Richard Wright on the north and the land of William Heynesworth on the south, and abutting upon the land of Robert Lowe towards the east, and upon the land of Nicholas Cressie towards the west. And further the said Edward Maude holds as in right of his vicarage all the aforesaid glebe lands of the vicarage aforesaid, and also all small tithes, viz. of hemp, line, ducks, geese, milk, and fruit, with all other small tithes within the whole lordship of Blyth aforesaid, viz. Blyth, Styrrup, Woodhouse, Olcotes, Ranskill, Torworth, Barnby, Little Hodsock, Great Hodsock, Nornay, Bilby Grange, Costrop, Billingley, Houghton More, and Hallfield in the parish of Bolton, and with all other tithes, viz. of sheaves, grain, hay, wool, and lambs, as hereafter appears, viz. tithes of wool and lambs of the inhabitants of the town of Blyth, all tithes of one piece of land in Ranskill called containing twenty acres, tithe of sheaves of Finchcroft containing twelve acres, of a close lying at Drawbridge Moor, and of one le Cunnygarth, in the tenure of George Inglishe, of sheaves of one close on the west of the Spital Barn containing six acres, of two closes belonging to le Spyttle near the stone cross contain ing eighteen acres, of one close near Hodsock Mill, and tithes of sheaves of Pecke Close con taining twenty acres, tithes of sheaves of le Waterbutts, of one close at Styrrup in the tenure of Nicholas Hibbard, containing one acre, of one little close near the same, now in the tenure of Dionysius Hughe, all tithes of sheaves of Dyscarre and Costrop, with all tithes of tofts and crofts within the whole lordship aforesaid ; and tithes of hay of the meadows and lands after written, viz., Waterbutts meadow, Finchcroft meadow, Briber Hill meadow, Prysting Syks, Bull meadow, Miln meadow, Westcroft Bottoms, Hellings, and le Mr Shworth Holme yard; and also tithes of woods of Bawtry and Austerfield, with free offerings of the whole parish aforesaid, except the greater offering days and mortuaries of Bawtry and Austerfield, as by the composition of the said vicar more fully appears ; and the yearly value is as is asserted. And further the said Edward has the herbage of the churchyard of Blyth aforesaid, which is worth annually, as is asserted, one"], [81, "63 THE VICARAGE. shilling; and a certain annual stipend of 3/. 7s. 2d. to be paid yearly at the feast of St. Michael the Archangel by the farmer of the rectory.\" In 1762 William and Charles Mellish, Esquires, and the Rev. Robert Pritchard, vicar, with the consent of the patrons and ordinary, made an exchange of properties, the former parties giving a messuage and croft adjoining (the present vicarage house and in part croft) and in Long Brechs 2 acres 1 rood, all then valued at 8/. yearly, in lieu of a messuage adjoining the churchyard, which is said to have been pulled down to widen the road of the vicarage yard near the Almry Croft, con taining about 3 roods, and of other lands, the yearly value of all of which is stated then to have been 6/. This messuage near the churchyard, it appears from a terrier of 1743, was not the ancient vicarage house, but was given by Mrs. Hiron, the widow of the Rev. William Hiron, vicar 1694-1731, and was very probably inhabited both by her husband and by the vicars who came after him till the time of the exchange of 1762. The original parsonage house, as we learn from the earliest existing terrier of the living, that of 1714, was burnt down about 1650. Such was the fate of the two modest old manses of the vicars of Blyth for more than five centuries, which occu pied a secluded and by their immediate proximity to the church a convenient position for their sacred duties, to say nothing of higher and holier advantages. The landed property of the vicar mentioned above was, I believe, most of it exchanged prior to or at the time of the inclosure with the owner of the Blyth estate for glebe more concentrated and nearer the vicarage. The chapel of Barnby, mentioned in the survey of Elizabeth, has long gone to decay. With respect to the small tithes of Billingley, in the parish of Darfield, Houghton More and Hallfield, in the parish of Bolton on-Dearne, there must have been some mistake. I am not aware that any of my predecessors ever claimed or received such. Probably the error arose from the circumstance of the convent of Blyth having had endowments in these places. The terriers mention the following compositions : \u2014 Every farm-house pays four pence; every cottage two pence halfpenny; every communicant two pence; for every cow that has a calf is paid one penny halfpenny, without a calf a penny ; for every foal a penny ; for a swarm of bees a penny ; for hens at farms four pence, at cottages two pence; for a dove-house two shillings, dove-chamber a shilling, garden two pence. Tithes of pigs, ducks, geese, fruits, turnips, potatoes, hemp, line, rapes, hops, and all other vicarial tithes, are paid throughout the parish, except where the lands are under a modus. Servants pay sive pence in the pound for their wages. These minuti\u0153 are curious now that we know nothing beyond acres and rent-charges standing opposite to them ; and they will become more so as we recede further and further from the time when tithes were either taken in kind, or a specific statement given of the articles for which a composition was demanded. My immediate predecessor filed bills in the Exchequer for three distinct matters connected chiefly with the township of Blyth. 1. Tithes of the abbey lands, which were alleged to be covered by a modus of six shillings; 2. Tithes of tofts and crofts purchased by Edward Mellish, Esq., of Sir William Clifton in the year 1685, and now part of the pleasure-grounds of Blyth Hall, for which a modus of five shillings was pleaded; and, 3. Tithe of milk and agistment tithe of barren cows, for which the compositions above named were pleaded. 1. In 1274 a survey appears to have been made of the Blyth demesnes of the convent. The contents of the different parcels of land and the names of the proprietors or tenants whose grounds lay adjacent to them are given in the Blyth chartulary. The monks then had 78 acres 1 rood beyond the water of Blyth and 29 acres 3 roods on this side of the water \u2014 in all 108 acres."], [82, "64 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. Whether this was all strictly within the township of Blyth, or whether some of it was comprised in the townships of Hodsock and Styrrup, is uncertain. In filing his bill the vicar admitted, agreeably to the survey of Henry VIIL, that there were formerly 169 acres of abbey land covered by a modus, but pleaded that the defendants did not by any evidence make out their farms to be parts of those lands, but on the contrary that such farms contained altogether 270 acres of alleged abbey land, which shewed an attempt on their part to extend the quantity. A decree was given for the vicar, on the ground that no description and no boundaries had been put in evidence, hut without prejudice to the defendants, \"in ease a further and more laborious enquiry should enable them to comply with the conditions required of defendants relying upon a defence of this kind.\" Some little time after my succeeding to the living, the late Henry Walker, Esq., at that time owner of the Blyth estate and as a part thereof of the abbey lands in question, informed me that additional evidence had been discovered tending to identify these lands; and in consequence, as I was anxious to avoid litigation, and my predecessor had admitted that there were 169 acres belonging to the convent covered by modus, I consented at the period of the tithe commutation in 1838 to release this amount from render of vicarial tithes on payment of the old modus, and to receive an adequate rent-charge for the remaining 101 acres. Adhering to the old designation for the sake of simplicity, I have to add that in Blyth the abbey land is computed in the tithe apportionment at 228 acres 9 perches, paying a rent-charge to the vicar of 13/. 10s. lOd. and free from all other rent-charges. The rest of this land is in Hodsock and Styrrup. 2. With respect to the Clifton Tofts and Crofts, a decree was also given for the vicar on the same grounds. Indeed the plea of modus was abandoned in the argument. 3. The parochial moduses in lieu of tithes of milk and of agistment of barren cows were confirmed. The messuage adjoining the churchyard, of which mention has been made as having been given to the vicarage by Mrs. Hiron, is stated in the terrier of 1743 to have been so given with a view of obtaining a grant from Queen Anne's Bounty in augmentation of the living \u2014 of so little value was the vicarage of Blyth in the former part of last century. Two grants were made by the Bounty Office, one in 1734, the other in 1742. With the first a public house in Retford, known by the name of the White Lion, was purchased: with the second a small parcel of land adjoining the same town. These properties, especially the first, which was an old house, and required constant repairs, it was by no means desirable to retain, and they were consequently sold in 1848 and 1849, and the proceeds invested in the public funds for the benefit of the vicarage. The White Lion stood on the site now occupied by the house and premises of Messrs. Liller, builders, between the parish church and the White Hart. It remained for my able and respected predecessor the Rev. John Rudd, among other good services, to be the re-constructor (if I may be permitted to use the word) of the vicarage of Blyth. On his succeeding to the living in 1813, he caused a careful valuation to be made by the late Mr. Teale of Leeds of the vicarial tithes in every township of the parish, and the compositions subse quently paid both to him and to myself previously to the commutation of tithes were founded upon this document, which was drawn up with great leniency and moderation. And now the vicar has rent-charges in every township with the exception of Austerfield and Barnby Moor, in which allotments of land in lieu of tithes were given many years ago."], [83, "65 CATALOGUE OF THE VICARS. I trust that the general reader will view these minute and personal details with indulgence, on the ground that, although purely local, they cannot be without interest to those who reside in, or are connected by property or family ties with, the parish of Blyth. One point I must not omit. The vicar of Blyth it appears has the right of hunting through the parish. My noble neighbour, and, if I may be permitted to call him so, friend, the lord of Serlby, now takes my domain as part of his country : and I have no wish to disturb one who is so much and so deservedly respected and beloved in this as indeed in every other field of duty. An amicable and equitable adjustment of our respective claims may easily be effected by his conferring upon me the office of chaplain to the Serlby Hunt, in which situation I shall have the honour of treading, at however humble a distance, in the footsteps of many eminent ecclesiastics of ancient times, among whom ought specially to be recorded the name of the illustrious Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, patriarch of Jerusalem, and King of the Isle of Man, who was passionately fond of the chace, kept excellent horses and hounds, and, if he had lived in these days, would have been a most popular prelate.* Catalogue of the Vicars of Blyth. 1.

Died September 1, 1812, and buried in the nave of Blyth church September 7. 46. John Rudd. Presented 6 February, 1813. Mr. Rudd was a member of an ancient family of that name in the county of York, and was lineally descended from John Rudd, whose brother Anthony was Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and consecrated Bishop of St. David's in 1593. Robert the son of John settled in the early part of the seventeenth century in Cumberland, in which county the family appear since that period to have chiefly resided. The subject of this brief notice, John, was the eldest child of John Rudd of Cockermouth, Esq., solicitor, and Jane his wife, youngest daughter of William Thompson of Workington, Esq., and was born at Cocker mouth December 23, 1770. After receiving his early education at the free grammar school of that place under Rev. Mr. Gilbank, he was removed to the school of Hawkshead, where he numbered among his schoolfellows William Wordsworth, the poet; Christopher Wordsworth, his brother, Master of Trinity college, Cambridge; and Robert Hodgson Greenwood, Senior Fellow of the same college ; between whom with other pupils of the school and himself was thus laid the founda tion of a long and valued friendship. Mr. Rudd was admitted a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge in October, 1788, and in 1792 graduated as Tenth Wrangler. He was elected Fellow of his college in the following year, and thenceforth appears to have divided his time and residence chiefly between Cambridge and Cockermouth, taking occasionally parochial duty for short periods in the neighbourhood of the latter. On the death of Mr. Pritchard he was, as already stated, pre sented to the vicarage of Blyth; and in April, 1813, married Elizabeth, the second daughter of Rev. Dr. Ferris, Dean of Battle and Prebendary of Chichester. The late Dowager Duchess of Newcastle and her second husband Sir Charles Crawford were then residing as tenants in Blyth Hall, and so exceedingly anxious were they that the parish should have the immediate advantao*e of an active and efficient resident clergyman, that they received into their own hospitable mansion the newly-appointed vicar and his bride, who continued for nine months the guests of these amiable and estimable persons, receiving from them the most unvarying kindness and courtesy, and not being permitted to take their departure until the vicarage was ready for their reception. Between the Duchess of Newcastle and Sir Charles Crawford on the one hand, and Mr. and Mrs. Rudd on the other, a heartfelt feeling of mutual regard and esteem was thus formed, which terminated only with death. Mr. Rudd was at an early period of his incumbency placed upon the commission of the peace for the county of Nottingham and the West riding of York, and on the chairmanship of the quarter sessions at Retford being vacated by the late Colonel Eyre, of Grove, he was unanimously appointed to fill that office, in which as well as in his other magisterial duties no man ever acquitted himself with greater ability and integrity. Such indeed was the eminence which as a magistrate he attained by his rapid and intuitive perception of the merits of cases brought before him, by his scrupulous love of justice, and his patient investigation of truth, that his doors were literally beset from almost morning to night by parties from not merely surrounding, but even from far distant, districts of the county, between whom he ever strove to effect if possible a peaceable reconciliation without resorting to ulterior and more severe measures. In matters affecting the general welfare of the county his opinion was at all times sought by the late excellent"], [87, "69 REQUIREMENTS OF THE PARISH. Duke of Newcastle then Lord Lieutenant, by the late Dukes of Portland and Norfolk, and other noble men and gentlemen of the shire, who always reposed confidence in the soundness of his judgment. He had the further privilege of enjoying the favourable regard of his diocesan Dr. Venables Vernon, Archbishop of York, who conferredjupon him the mastership of the hospital of St. Mary Magdalene, Bawtry, and a stall at Southwell, in virtue of which he succeeded to the rectory of Waltham, in Lincolnshire. These preferments he held to his death. As I have already mentioned one or two and shall have occasion in the course of this history to speak of other tithe suits in which my predecessor was engaged, I feel it due to his memory and to truth to guard my readers against any conclusions of an unfavourable character which they might be induced to draw from such circumstances. Mr. Rudd was by no means a litigious person ; on the contrary, no man was more anxious in the spirit of the apostolic precept to seek peace and ensue it. When however on a careful survey of his parish he found districts varying from hundreds to thousands of acres covered by moduses, that is in fact, under the name and form of law screened from render to him of what he conscientiously believed to be his just rights \u2014 when further a diligent and earnest examination of ancient documents and of living witnesses conspired to demonstrate that these alleged moduses were really nothing better in general than mere modern compositions made between modern and interested proprietors on the one hand and modern vicars on the other, and were utterly inadequate in point of value and amount as equivalents for his vicarial tithes, he felt justified in appealing to the law of the land for the vindication of his rights. That he failed in the accomplishment of His purpose is most true : but he was not the first, neither will he be the last, to fail in substantiating a righteous cause before an earthly tribunal, for reasons which, although perfectly known both to himself and to his surviving friends, will never be brought to full light till the day of the Great Assize. In all the private relations of life Mr. Rudil was most exemplary; and his memory is and will continue to be held in reverence and respect by all who had the happiness and the opportunity of knowing and appreciating his excellence, whether in the intercourse of private life or in the discharge of his public duties. He died July 8, 1834, and lies buried in the north aisle of Blyth Church. 47. John Raine. Presented November, 1834. Requirements of the Parish. Mention has already been made of an additional minister, ordained and endowed by the ancient proprietors of the parish for the express purpose of assisting the vicar in the duties of his extensive cure. Herein, as in other matters, our ancestors have laid down a sound principle of action for our guidance and imitation, and it will be our wisdom to tread in their steps, rather than be guided by vicious legislation and a parsimonious and lukewarm age, which acting recipro cally upon each other cast on the incumbents of our extensive and populous parishes a large share of the burthen of the erection and maintenance of new churches and additional clergy. In the spirit of such legislation, the vicarage of Blyth has been already denuded of a portion of its ancient endowments, with a view to the construction of the new benefice of Bawtry-cum- Austerfield ; and, when the size of the still remaining portion of the parish, the nine shillings' modus upon 2,200 acres of Great Hodsock, as well as other moduses, and the position which the vicar of Blyth is"], [88, "70 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. expected, nay required, to occupy in a by no means inexpensive part of the country, are all taken into account, I know not that the process of depletion can be carried any further. Unquestionably it is most desirable that at least two new churches should be built and well endowed in this opulent and intelligent parish, one at Ranskill and another at Barnby Moor. But, bearing in mind these facts : 1 . that the vicar of Blyth received ever in times past many personal aids and advantages at the hands of his rectors, the prior and convent, now represented by Trinity College, who derive a revenue of nearly 3,000/. a year from the rectorial tithes of the parish ; 2. that an additional presbyter was provided by the landed proprietors to aid in the spiritual ministrations of the parish, on the express ground of its great and extensive territory; 3. that our ancient lords of the soil, the Buillis of Bawtry, the Cressys of Hodsock, the Cossards of Cossardthorp, and the Barnbys of Barnby, all founded and maintained at their own cost chapels of ease, as it were, upon their own demesnes, which they unhesitatingly and ungrudgingly threw open to the use of their dependants and neighbours, I arrive at the conclusion, which I cannot persuade myself has any admixture of unreasonableness, or injustice, or impracticability in it, that upon the proprietors, and upon the owners of the great tithes, rests the duty both of originating and completing measures for the provision of additional religious services in this parish ; and writing as I do after an experience of a quarter of a century, and under a calm conviction of the truth of my views, untinged by either prejudice or passion, I feel it my duty to place my opinion upon permanent record, with the full assurance that truth and justice will eventually prevail.

The Dissolution of the Convent; The Descent of the Demesnes of the Monastery, and of the Manor of Blyth, with Notices of the Families of Saunderson, Mellish, and Walker. The distant echoes of that storm which at length burst with such pitiless and unrelenting fury upon the Church had been at intervals long heard. So far back as the reign of Henry IV. the House of Commons passed a Bill for stripping the Church of its revenues, and applying them to the exigencies of the State. This was, in the words of Sir Thomas More, \" about the time of a great rumble that the heretics made, when they would have destroyed, not the clergy only, but the king also, and his nobility too,\" and when \" there was a foolish Bill and a false put into a Parliament or twain, and sped as they were worthy.\" Again, in the fourth year of Henry V when the sovereign was at war with France, all alien priories which were not conventual were by Act of Parliament dissolved, and their revenues granted to the Crown. And finally Wolsey, in 1524, obtained the royal and papal license to suppress forty small monasteries, and to appro priate their estates to his college of Christ Church. The breach was thus made, the precedent established, and Henry VIII. proved himself an apt scholar in mastering and applying the lessons which others had taught him. Having succeeded by Act of Parliament in constituting himself head of the Church, or, in the exceedingly correct and candid admission of Lord Campbell, in making himself Pope in place of the sovereign pontiff of Rome, and having thus come to an open rupture with him, he sound it necessary, with a view to secure his own ascendancy, to sap the fortresses and exterminate the forces of his adversary. The papal strength lay in the monastic orders, and accordingly Cromwell, the vicar-general of the king, appointed a commission of inquiry into the state and condition of the smaller monasteries, and in February, 1535-6, all houses possessing a revenue of less than 200/. a-year were destroyed, and their possessions made over to the crown. By this Act 376 convents were suppressed without opposition, for they were represented as being degenerate and corrupt; they had little or no con nection or sympathy with the aristocracy, the younger members of whose families were generally located in the wealthier convents, and they were poor and feeble. This measure was a feeler : within three years of this first stroke, the king's rapacity, sharpened by Ms excessive profusion, impeUed him to attack the greater and wealthier monasteries, and they in their turn, to the number of 269, fell. The neighbouring convents of Roche and Worksop, possessing each of them an annual income of more than 200/., survived until the final measure of spoliation was consummated. The last abbot of Roche, Henry Cundal, with seventeen monks, surrendered his house to the king June 23, 1539 ; he received a pension of 33/. 6s. 8c/. and his brethren pensions varying from 61. 13s. Ad. to 3/. Gs. 8d. The revenues of Roche Abbey, in the 26th Henry VIII. amounted in"], [90, "72 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. the gross to 271/. 19s. Ad. and the clear income to 224/. 2s. 5d. The last prior of Worksop, Thomas Stokker, with fifteen of his brethren, surrendered his priory November 15, 1539, and received a pension of 50/. a-year, while they obtained pensions varying from 6/. to 21. The gross income was estimated at 302/. 6s. 10./. and the reprisals at 62/. 11s. 5c/. On the 22nd of November, 1541, a grant was made of the site and precincts of various messuages and lands of the priory of Worksop to Francis, Earl of Shrewsbury, aud his heirs, at an annual rent of 23/. Os. 8|c/. and on service of finding the king a right-hand glove, and supporting his right arm whilst holding the sceptre, on the day of his coronation. Our humble Priory of Blyth was suppressed before these its more opulent neighbours, namely, in 1535. Its income was returned as being 126/. 8s. 2%d. and reprisals 13/. 7s. 6d. I cannot discover anywhere what number of monks it then contained, or what pensions were allowed to them and their superior. In the second and third years of the reign of Philip and Mary, Cardinal Pole moved Parliament to inquire into and confirm the pensions granted by Henry VIII. to members of the dissolved houses. The return, entitled Cardinal Pole's Book, now in the general Record Office, contains but one notice of Blyth Priory. \" Blythe Feod. Jervasii Clyfton militis, capitalis seneschalli ibidem, per an. xls.\" We may conclude that Dalton, the last prior, and his monks were then dead, for I can hardly think that they were turned adrift out of their ancient and rightful home into a wide world without some provision, and I feel assured that, however much they, like their brethren throughout the kingdom, might become subjects for the scurrilous and ribald jests of the irreverent and the profane, they still received, in this barbarous disruption of their long-cherished habits, and friendships, and associations, the sympathy and kindness of the generous and the good. On the 3rd of July, 1543, the king granted the site and demesnes of the Priory, of which, with the rectory, Gervase Clifton, of Hodsack, esquire, had received a lease for twenty-one years, bearing date the 10th of July, 1537, to Richard Andrews, of Gloucester, gentleman, and William Ramsden, of Longley, in the county of York, yeoman. These two men were among the chief monastic stock-jobbers of the day; they, in company with other members of their firm, bargained with Henry for the sites and demesnes of Blyth, Benedictine Priory ; Caermarthen, Austin Canons ; Denbigh, White Friars ; Gloucester, White Friars ; Malvern, Little, Benedictine Cell ; Northampton, Black Friars and White Friars ; Norwich, White Friars ; Oxford, Black Friars, Grey Friars, and College of St. Mary ; Roche, Cistercian Abbey ; Sele (Sussex), White Friars ; Shrewsbury, Austin Friars, Black Friars, and Grey Friars ; Temple Comb, Somersetshire ; Yar mouth, Black Friars ; all of which they speedily sold again at remunerating prices. The grant of the site and demesnes of Blyth Priory to Andrews and Ramsden, as we find it in the patent roll of the 35th Henry VIII., is in these words: \u2014 \"Ac etiam totum ilium scitum septum circuitum ambitum et procinctum nuper monasterii de Blythe in coniitatu nostro Nottingham, cum suis juribus, membris et pertinentiis universis, ac omnia et singula domos, edificia, ortos, pomeria, gardina, columbaria, stagna, vivaria, aquas, piscarias et pisca tiones, terrain, et solum nostra infra scitum septum circuitum ambitum seu procinctum ejusdem nuper monasterii existentia, neenon centum viginti tres acras et dimidium terr\u00e6 arrabalis, viginti quatuor acras prati, et viginti imam acras et dimidium pastur\u00e6 cum pertinentiis jacentes et exis tentes in parochia de Blythe in dicto comitatu Nottingham et dicto nuper monasterio de Blythe dudum spectantes et pertinentes, ac terras dominicales ejusdem nuper monasterii dudum existentes"], [91, "THE FAMILY OF SAUNDERSON. 73 et sic insimul cum pr\u00e6dicto scitu ejusdem nuper monasterii cuidam Gervasio Clyston generoso dimissas seu locatas.\" This grant, it will be observed, did not include the manor, which, as will appear, was a subse quent addition to the Blyth estate. Andrews and Ramsden held the site and demesnes at a yearly rent of 15s. 8%d., to be paid at Michaelmas into the Court of Augmentations, in the name of a tenth part of the premises thus granted to them; and by service of the fortieth part of one knight's fee. They made a rapid transfer, for on the 25th July, 1543, I find that they obtained a licence to alienate to Richard Stansfield, citizen and skinner of London, their monastic grant at Blyth, with the exception of some lead on certain buildings.

On the 3rd July, 20 Elizabeth, Edward Stanhope, esq., afterwards Sir Edward Stanhope, son of Sir Michael Stanhope, second son of Sir Edward Stanhope of Rampton, purchased of Stansfield Cooke, gent., and Richard Cooke, esq., the site and certain lands late, in part only probably, the property of the convent of Blyth. It appears that Sislcy Cooke advanced some claim to this estate, which for certain considerations made to him by Stanhope he relinquished, and 39th Elizabeth obtained licence to alienate the property, which then exceeded the original grant made to Andrews and Ramsden, being represented as comprising one messuage, two cottages, two tofts, one dovecote, two gardens, 140 acres of arable land, 80 acres of meadow, 60 acres of pasture, 3 of wood, and common pasture for 500 sheep and cattle, with the appurtenances, in Blyth, Bawtry, Hermeston, and Harworth. During the ownership of Stanhope, Stansfield and his heirs, the family of Neville appear to have occupied Blyth Abbey as tenants. Mr. Robert Neville was buried at Blyth, March 14, 1558, and Mr. Gervase Neville, of Blyth Abbey, December 24, 1601. His will is dated September 11 of the same year, and mentions among others his brother Francis Neville, sisters Meares and Eyre, brother, nephew, and nieces Eyre, nieces Fretwell and Wastneys, and he desires to be buried in the church. In the first year of James I. Sir Edward Stanhope, then described as of Gray's Inn, knight, conveyed this estate to Robert Saundcrson, of Gilthwaite, in the parish of Rotherham, gent, and Elizabeth his wife, and William Saundcrson their eldest son. The Saunderson Family. The Saundersons sprang from Bidick, in the parish of Washington and county of Durham. Jacob de Bidick, the son of Alexander, is styled Saunderson, silius Alexandri, and lived in the time of Edward III. John Saundcrson of Tickhill, his lineal descendant of the third generation, i."], [92, "74 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. had two sons, William and Henry, from the former of whom descended the Saundersons of Sand beck, eventually Viscounts Castleton ; and from the latter numerous branches whom we find located at Ewes (now Yews), Blyth, Blyth Nornay, Barnby Moor, Styrrup, Gilthwaite in the parish of Rotherham, Sheffield, and Serlby; the last of which they owned until the early part of the eighteenth century, when the heirs of Mary Saunderson, the last proprietor, sold the Serlby estate to John Monckton of Hodroyd, Esq., afterwards first Viscount Gal way. This purchase was effected in 1725. Robert Saunderson of Saxby, in the county of Lincoln, the original purchaser of Sandbeck, which had belonged to Roche Abbey, in 1549, was the grandson of William just named. In 1627 William Saunderson, as I shall state more at length under Torworth, purchased Serlby and Torworth of the last heir of the ancient family of Serlby, which he mortgaged the same year to his son-in-law Robert Mellish. In 1635 he sold the Blyth estate to John Mellish, the brother of Robert, merchant-tailor of London, and took a lease of the new proprietor, who was non-resident, for twenty-one years, which he held from 1635 to 1646. About 1642 he sublet the property to Colonel Haley a royalist, who, falling in with the unscrupulous proceedings of the times, found it convenient to represent to the Earl of Newcastle, the general of the king's forces, that John Mellish was a rebel, and upon this representation obtained a sequestration of the Blyth estate in his own favour. William Saunderson is said to have pleaded the services of his son, who had lost his life whilst fighting for his sovereign at Nottingham bridge, as a just ground why the estate should be conveyed to himself, but to have failed. In 1646 Mellish was reinstated in his Blyth possessions, the rent of which he had lost for the four previous years, Saunderson refusing to complete the term of his lease, and having by assignment of his effects to his own family rendered it impossible to recover compensation. These are not very creditable transactions ; and there are other charges alleged against him by the Mellish family in his dealings with their ancestor, implicating in the way of collusion their own relative and Saunderson's son-in-law, Robert Mellish, to whom, as living in the neighbourhood, John Mellish is said to have entrusted the management of his Blyth property, which, if true, by no means tend to raise either the father-in-law or the son-in-law in the estimation of just and upright men. But it is possible that the picture may be overcharged. We have no documents in exist ence whereby we are enabled to ascertain the defence which the accused parties made against these charges, and therefore they had better be allowed to pass quietly down the stream of time into oblivion. Btr,hop Stamdtyaon. Of one member of the Saunderson family at all events it is permitted to us to speak in terms of unqualified admiration. This is Robert Saunderson, Bishop of Lincoln, a man of vigorous and subtle intellect, of deep and fervent piety, of child-like simplicity and modesty, and, in times of persecution and suffering even unto blood, of undaunted firmness and constancy in his adherence to the Anglican Church, which from ashes and ruin he saw restored, yea, and largely himself helped to restore, to her ancient integrity and strength. He was born at Gilthwaite, in the parish of Rotherham, Sept. 19, 1587, and, after receiving his early education at Archbishop Rotherham's School in that place, matriculated July 1, 1603, at Lincoln College, Oxford, the rector of which"], [93, "75 THE FAMILY OF SAUNDERSON.

He was elected Fellow of his College May 3, 1606, proceeded M.A. July 11, 1608, and in the same year was chosen reader of logic in the college, and re-chosen 1609. In 1611 he was ordained deacon and priest; in 1613, 1614, and 1616 elected sub-rector; and in the last year senior proctor of the University. Among his university friends he numbered Laud and Gilbert Sheldon, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, for whom his father and Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury had stood sponsors. He took the degree of B.D. in 1617, and in 1618 was presented by Sir Nicholas Saunderson, Viscount Castleton, to the rectory of Wibberton, in the county of Lincoln, which not suiting his health he resigned in about a twelvemonth, and was shortly after presented by Thomas Harington, of Boothby Pagnell, esq. to the rectory of Boothby, which he held for nearly forty years, and where his chief works were composed. In the same year (1619) he was appointed to a stall in Southwell, as well as to one in Lincoln, and married Anne, the daughter of Henry Nelson, B.D. rector of Hougham, not far distant from his own benefice \u2014 \"his parish (says Isaak Walton), his patron, and he, living together in a religious love and a contented quietness.\" In 1625 he was chosen proctor of convocation for the diocese of Lincoln, and he continued to hold that office throughout the reign of Charles I. Through the influence of Laud he was in 1631 made chaplain in ordinary to the king, who used to say of him \u2014 \" I carry my ears to hear other preachers, but I carry my conscience to hear Mr. Saunderson, and to act accordingly.\" On the visit of Charles to Oxford in 1636 Saunderson was created D.D., the same honour being conferred on Meric Casaubon, and honorary degree of M.A. on Prince Bupert and several of the nobility. In 1642 he was proposed by Parliament to the king as one of the commissioners for the settlement of church affairs, and in the same year was nominated Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. He was, with Hammond and Sheldon, included among the twenty delegates selected by the university to draw up a protest against the Covenant, Negative Oath, and Ordinance for Public Worship, imposed upon them by parliament. In 1646 Charles I. sent for Saundcrson, Hammond, Sheldon, and Morley, to advise with him respecting the proposals of parliament for the establishment of peace in church and state, and held many conferences with him, both public and private, during his imprisonment in the Isle of Wight. In 1648 he was expelled by the Presbyterians from the divinity chair at Oxford, and at Boothby was compelled to make slight alterations in the mode of performing divine service, with a view to appease the rabid fury of the Puritans; but even thus he was frequently interrupted durino* the service, and his Prayer Book torn by the soldiers of the parliament. The public confession which he substituted for that of the Book of Common Prayer, and which varies but very little from it (for Saunderson had not the gift, if gift it be, of fluency of oration), is to be found in some of our sound manuals of private devotion. In his humble but not quiet retirement of Boothby he received a visit from the great and good Hammond, with whom he held a long correspondence respecting the quinquarticular con troversy. No sooner was his visitor gone than Saunderson was seized by the parliamentary forces, and carried prisoner to Lincoln, by way of reprisals for the Eev. \u2014 Clarke, incumbent of Allino-ton, a neighbouring village, and an adherent of the parliament, who had been taken prisoner at Belvoir Castle by the Boyalists and conveyed to Newark. They were exchanged, and Boothby, which had been under sequestration since 1644, was restored to Saunderson."], [95, "77 THE FAMILY OF SAUNDERSON. At the Eestoration he was, on the recommendation of Archbishop Sheldon, appointed to the see of Lincoln, and consecrated at Westminster October 28, 1660. He was chosen moderator in the Savoy Conference, and at the ensuing Convocation is said to have drawn up the prayer of general thanksgiving, as he certainly drew up the present preface to the Prayer Book, commencing with the words \" It hath been the wisdom of the Church,\" and exhibiting very strongly the sound judgment and moderation of its author. He was not destined to hold his new situation long. He had for some time been subject to periodical attacks of illness, from the combined effects of which, of years, and probably of the troubles through which he had passed, he sank on the 29th January 1662. He was buried in the chancel of Buckden church, and the following inscription, composed by himself, was placed upon his tomb: \" Depositum Roberti Saunderson nuper Lincolniensis Episcopi, qui obiit Anno Domini mdclxii. et \u00e6tatis su\u00e6 septuagesimo sexto. Hie requiescit in spe beat\u00e6 resurrectionis.\" His principal works are the following : I. Sermons. His printed sermons are thirty-six in number, and were preached in and between 1619 and 1648, namely, seventeen before the court, five visitation sermons, six assize sermons, and the rest to congregations at Grantham, St. Paul's London, and St. Paul's Cross. Of the last class of discourses three were originally printed together in 1627, and dedicated by the author from Boothby Pagnell \" To the right worshipful and my much honoured lady, the Lady Mildred Sanderson, wife to Sir Nicholas Sanderson, knight and baronet.\" II. Notes of eight sermons preached at Carfax. The Rev. Dr. Routh, late President of Magdalen College, Oxford, purchased in 1844 of Mr. Thorp, the London bookseller, a MS. volume containing notes apparently drawn up by various hands unknown, of forty-one sermons delivered by nine different preachers in Oxford, at ' St. Mary's, at Carfax, and elsewhere. xVmong the rest are notes of eight sermons preached by Saunderson at Carfax in 1617 or 1618. III. Seven lectures de Juramenti Promissorii Obligatione were read in the Michaelmas term of 1646 at Oxford. Of this treatise a translation appeared in 1655, which, according to the state ment of Sir Thomas Herbert in his \" Memoirs of the two last years of King Charles I.\" was executed by the king, \" which in his bed-chamber he was pleased to shew his servants, Mr. Har ington and Mr. Herbert, and, commanding them to examine it with the original, they found it accurately translated.\" IV. Ten lectures de Obligatione Conscicnti\u00e6 were delivered in 1647. These lectures were not printed till 1660. A second edition was issued in 1661; other editions following in 1671, 1682, 1686, 1710, and 1719; and in 1851 the Rev. Dr. Whewell, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, edited the lectures, with an abridged translation. V. Tracts published in 1666. Marrying with a Recusant; Unlawful Love; Military Life; Scandal; Bond taken in King's name. The Engagement and Rash Vow appeared in 1668; the Case of the Sabbath in 1673; that of the Liturgy in 1678. VI. Pax Ecclesi\u00e6 was printed, together with the first edition of Walton's Life of Saun derson, in 1678. VII. \" Compendium of Logic,\" published without the author's name in 1615, again in 1618, and for a third time in 1631. Saunderson was greatly attached to genealogical and heraldic studies, which he appears to have pursued more by way of recreation than with any definite object. Of the extensive collections"], [96, "78 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. which he left behind him in manuscript the larger portion were for a time, after having been dis persed, reunited in the library of the late Sir Joseph Banks. At his death they were excepted out of the number bequeathed to the British Museum, and were very probably designed to be heir looms at Revesby : they however became the property of his widow, and from her descended to the Knatchbulls. One MS. volume, which contained the Saunderson Pedigree, remained from the first with the bishop's descendants, who, in process of time falling in the social scale to the rank of farmers, and caring little about matters of ancestry, used the book for agricultural purposes, so that the prices of the sale of corn, and the registers of breeding of cattle, were scribbled in an ill-spelt and vulgar hand over the pages of the good bishop's elaborate entries. This MS. is or was in the possession of a Mr, Clarke, now or late Cole, living near Normanby in the county of Lincoln, who descended from Jane, a daughter of the bishop's second son, by her marriage with William Clarke ; and the Saunderson pedigree, drawn up by the bishop and em bodied in that above given, was extracted from it a few years ago by the present Sir Charles H. J. Anderson, of Lea, bart. Another descendant of Bishop Saunderson is Rev. John King, of Ashby de la Launde, near Sleaford, by marriage of his ancestor with one of the Middlemores of Grantham. Mr. King, I believe, possesses some of the bishop's plate, with his arms and mitre engraven upon it. If Saunderson's father on purchasing Blyth made it, as is probable, his residence, the son must have spent his college vacations here. He must have followed his father's remains to the grave at Blyth, and paid occasional visits to his brother afterwards at Blyth Abbey. William Saunder son's name occurs in the records of our parish meetings, but Robert's name we nowhere possess. The recollection of Boothby Pagnell, and of Robert Saunderson, suggests another place and another name, both of them of imperishable reputation \u2014 Woolsthorpe and Newton. When New ton as a boy was making his dials at Woolsthorpe, and pursuing his studies at Grantham school, Saunderson was living very near him, either engaged in the humble discharge of his parochial duties of rector of Boothby and in the composition of some of his great works, or as an inhabitant of Grantham, after his ejection from his living. Doubtless the country parson and student fre quently saw, and admired, and encouraged the youthful philosopher; and when the one entered as an undergraduate of Trinity College, he made the Treatise on Logic of the other a subject of his careful study. If the remark of Cicero with respect to Athens, \" Quocumque ingredimur, in aliquant historiam vestigia ponimus,\" apply, as it certainly does, with great truth to almost the whole of English ground, then nowhere surely does the admonitus locorum speak with deeper eloquence than around the consecrated retreats of Boothby and Woolsthorpe, the homes of the acute lo gician, and lover and admirer of the church and monarchy of England in their tribulation as well as in their prosperity, and of the most sublime genius whom God in his beneficent wisdom has ever given to the world.* * Nothing which relates to so great and good a man as Bishop Saunderson can be unimportant or uninteresting. In the parish registers of Boothby-Pagnell, which I have been permitted to examine through the kindness of the Rev. W. C. Newcome, the rector, to whom I beg to offer my grateful acknow ledgments, I find the following entry in Saunderson's own handwriting : \u2014 \" Robert Sanderson was inducted into the rectory of Boothby Pannell on Tuesday ye seventh day of Sep. a\u00b0 pr\u00e6dict.\" i. e. 1619. The entries are certified at the foot of each page henceforth thus : \" Ita est. Robert: Sanderson, rector dict\u00e6 ecclesi\u00e6.\" \" Ita est. Robertus Sanderson, rector eccl'e de Boothby Paynell.\" \" Ita est. Robertus Sander son, rector eccl'e,\" or simply \" Robt. Sanderson, rector,\" or \" Robt. Sanderson, rector eccl'e,\" down to"], [97, "79 THE FAMILY OF MELLISH. The Mellish Family. The estate of Blyth passed by purchase, as already stated, from the Saundersons to the Mel lishes. Robert Mellish, the first member of this family whose name presents itself to us, is described the year 1654, when the following memorandum occurs : \" Md That Edward Allanson, of Boothby, was elected, approved, and sworn, the parrish register of Boothy Pannell, the last day of July, 1654. Wm. Brownlowe.\" Mr. Brownlow was a magistrate, of Humby Magna, in the adjoining parish of Somerby. After 1654 the only mention I can find of Saunderson in the register of Boothby is this : \" John Pridgeon and Elizabeth Boothbie, in the certificate aforesaid, were married at Grantham by William Clarke, alderman, justice of the peace for the comonwealth anil towne and corporation of Grantham, in the presence of John Spraggin, Robert Saunderson, and others.\" This was in November or December, 1656. The fact that he officiated in the parish down to 1654 is readily reconcileable with the statement given above from Walton, that Boothby had been under sequestration since 1644. For although, in consequence of his refusing to take the covenant and engagement, his rectory was sequestrated in 1644, yet such was his reputation for piety and learning, that he was not deprived of it. After 1654 his name is nowhere, with the above exception, to be found in the registers. The entries are made for a time by the register Allanson, and then by another rector, appointed, we may presume, by Cromwell. From this year to the Restoration Saunderson resided chiefly, it is believed, in Grantham, and had the consolation of finding there a man who resembled himself in the soundness of his principles, Dr. Thomas Hurst, who had, like himself, been ejected from his living, the rectory of Barrowby. Before this these two excellent men had done much to stem the torrent of blasphemy and impiety, by giving weekly lectures in the church of Grantham ; they had alleviated the sufferings of the town during the plague of 1637, anil had encouraged the parish to resist the innovations in the mode of conducting divine service. In grateful acknowledgment of their labours of love the corporation in the year 1637 presented them with the freedom of the borough, inscribing their names in letters of gold on their courtiers, and recording that their ministrations \" had tended much to the glory of God, the furtherance of true religion, and conformity.\" In 1661 Saunderson, now Bishop of Lincoln, presented to the library over the south porch of Grantham church (which had been founded by the Rev. Francis Trigge, rector of Welbourn, in 1598), the rare Antwerp Polyglott Bible in eight volumes, which was printed at Antwerp for Philip II., King of Spain, and of which nearly the whole impression, amounting to 500 copies, was lost at sea on its passage from Antwerp to a Spanish harbour. Saunderson, at that time engaged in assisting Dr. Walton in the compilation of his Polyglott Bible, procured a copy which he gave to Grantham, and of which, I regret to add, only one complete volume and portions of four or five others remain. I return to Boothby. Saunderson's entries of baptisms, marriages, and burials are, up to the year 1642, written in a remarkably neat hand. After that time I cannot but think that they indicate tremor and agitation. The church is precisely as he found it and left it. It consists of a nave, north and south aisles, with chancel, and a tower at the west end. The nave comprises two round arches with massive piers at each side, which are of the early part of the twelfth century. One pier on the south side, next the pulpit, has a cushion capital with volutes at the angles ; the next pier on the same side a capital of crimped inverted cones vertically cut. It has been, subsequently to its original construction, raised, and now exhibits two good clerestory windows on each side of decorated character. The south aisle is short, and terminates abreast of the chancel arch. The north aisle extends two arches beyond the chancel arch, opening through these arches into the chancel. The windows of this aisle are all of three lights below, ending in trefoils ; and above are three quatrefoils, sharp at top and bottom, and round at the sides, placed triangularly, and filled up at the sides with crescents, the tracery all being deep and splayed. This aisle is the burial place of the Litchfords of Boothby, as previously it was of the Ilaringtons. There is a brass tablet in the wall of the north-east corner in memory of \"Katherine, late wife of Thomas Harington of Boothby Paynell, Esq.\" who died May 5, 1623, and of Henry, Thomas, Margaret, and Eliza, their children. The family arms above the inscription, in two shields, are a fess ermine between three water bougets ; and a fret (Harington's knot, as it is called). This Thomas Harington it was who gave Saunderson the living. A branch of his family was settled at Grantham in the reign of Edward I. The chancel, light and elegant, contains three windows and piscina on the south side; on the north side, one"], [98, "80 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. as of London, merchant-tailor, and of Sanderstead, Surrey. He died March 30, 1562, and was buried in All Hallows church in Bread Street Ward. John Mellish, the son of Robert, in his will proved March 9th, 1587-8, states himself of North Willingham, in the county of Lincoln, and desires to be buried there. Edward the eldest son of John, in his will bearing date 5th November, 1615, and proved 4th April, 1616, states, that he is citizen of London and merchant-tailor, and leaves one-third of his property to his wife Alice, one-third to his three sons John, Robert, and William, and remaining third for legacies and funeral expenses. Alice, the widow of Edward Mellish, and daughter of William Reason of Scarcliff, co. Derby, in her will dated 20th March, 1617, and proved 20th May following, leaves her eldest son John sole executor, and directs him to go into partnership with Richard Turgis, citizen and merchant- tailor, with whom she herself had been in partnership. She had a brother William Reason of Askham, Notts. who in his will 13th November, 1627, proved 30th April, 1629, devised to his nephew John Mellish his estate at Hognaston, to his nephew Robert Mellish his estate at Fledborough, to his kinsman Thomas Reason his estate at West Drayton and Little Drayton, and to his sister Ann Smith his estate at South Wheatley. This last named John Mellish, the great-grandson of Robert first named, and merchant-tailor * G G l of London, it was who bought Blyth of the Saundersons in 1635. The estate had been somewhat enlarged by the Saundersons: and when Mellish purchased it, it is said to have comprised 489 acres 2 roods, of which 244 acres were alleged to be abbey land, to have been worth about 2A21. per annum, and cost 3,900Z. John Mellish never resided here. He died 15th March, 1677-8, in the 80th year of his age, at the house of his son-in-law Air. Gardener, in Fenchurch Street, and was buried on the 19th in the chancel of Woodford church, Essex, in the same grave with his wife. He has left behind him \" An Estate Book \" as he called it, containing various accounts of window of the same character as those on the south side, and the two arches already mentioned. These four windows bear a strong resemblance to, although they are not quite identical with, those of the north aisle. The east window, a remarkably good one, is of five lights ending in trefoils, and above contains quatrefoils and trefoils, the tracery having the appearance of branches hanging off from upright stems, and at the summit a quatrefoil filled with old stained glass. The reading-desk and pulpit, with their old oak and stone steps, exceedingly plain and simple, are much what they were in Saunderson's time. The latter is said to contain marks of bullets which were shot at him by the soldiers of the Parliament. I cannot credit the tradition ; for within so short a distance they must inevitably have proved fatal. I think they are vacant places left by knots in the wood, which have given way. The font is of the age of the nave, decorated with arcading, and underneath the shafts with an imbattled line. The tower is about the same age again as the nave, except the parapet, which is later, and contains arms, probably those of the donor, two couple-closes. The rectory, a modern house, is within a few yards of the church, and stands doubtless on the site of the old house of Saunderson. The village is very small and secluded. There was found a few years ago in a farm-house, blocking up a fireplace, a picture, confidently believed to be a portrait of Saunderson, which the then rector carried away with him to another benefice. I conclude this long note by giving my readers a facsimile of the handwriting of Robert Saunderson, as it exists to this day in the parochial registers of Boothby-Pagnell, near Grantham."], [99, "81 THE FAMILY OF MELLISH. receipts and expenses from 25th July, 1648, to within a short period of his death, from which I make a few extracts tending to illustrate the history and manners of the times. \u00a3 s. d. 1648, Oct. 6, recd of the lordes and commons in Parliam' the money I lent them ye 7th Nov. 1642, towardes the raisinge of a thousand dragoneers . . . . .5000 Then recd of them the money I lent them 3d March, 1642, to raise money accordinge to certaine propositions by an ordinance of the 7th of Jany. 1642 . . . 50 0 0 Then recd of them the money I lent them the 5th Deer. 1643, for advance money to the Scots 25 0 0 Recd 15th of June, '1649, of Richard Bynglie per Mr. Lovvndes in full for halfe a yeares rent for my lands at Blythe due at Martynmas last . . . . . . 100 0 0 17 Deer. 1649, of Mr. Wm.

He had resided for many years as a merchant at Oporto, and after realising \" a plentiful estate,\" in the language of his monumental inscription, returned to England in October, 1671. In 1684 he began to take down the old residence of Blyth Abbey, and in April of that year commenced building the present Blyth Hall, upon which, to June 22, 1685, he had expended 2,106Z. Is. I0\\d. The timber was brought from Sandbeck Park, and consisted of forty-two trees, containing 2,055 feet and costing 81/. 8s.; thirteen more, costing \\8l. 13s. I0d.; twelve, costing 19/. 10s. The bricks were made upon Lindrick Common, and the whole of the masons' work cost 230?. 2s. 3d. Additional accounts for plastering, bricks, tiles, and lead came in. Seven marble chimney-pieces cost 631.; and the sum total paid to June 30, 1685, was 4,108?. 13s. ll\\d. August 2, 1689, he states in his ledger \" the whole cost and charges of building the abbey house, out-houses, and walls about the grounds, repairing the church end, making the vault and pew in the church, the garden and fish-ponds, levelling and planting the said grounds and cutting the river straight before the said house since April, 1684, y1 I fyrst began to build, which cost I now transfer to stock to adjust the account of the said house, 6,083/. 4s. lljtf.\" Like his father he kept strict accounts of his receipts and expenses. The rental of his Blyth estate was 2501. He resided generally at Blyth Hall, took the position of a country gentleman, was high sheriff for the shire in 1692, by which office he was 1801. \" out of pocket,\" and travelled to and from London, not in a stage coach like his father, but \"in my calash.\" He seems to have had great practical experience in law-suits, for in January, 1687-8, he was at law with Roger Williams, formerly captain of his (Mellish's) ship Valentine, which the French had taken and carried into Flushing and which Williams had redeemed partly with money \" hid in her sides,\" with Rev. Frith, William Daynes, Francis Gosfright and Thomas Death, and Francis Hol lingshead, in addition to a long and costly course of litigation with his brother-in-law Sherrington, which commenced whilst he was in Portugal, and terminated in his recovering from the latter damages to the amount of 12,000/., part of which was paid by the transfer to him of an estate at Fenwick, in the parish of Campsall, then valued at 5,998/. 13s. lid., which continued in the Mellish family till 1762, when William and Charles Mellish sold it to Thomas Wild, Esq."], [101, "83 THE FAMILY OF MELLISH.

This estate of the Mellish family in North Nottinghamshire was considerably enlarged by purchases of the brothers Edward and William Mellish, as the reader will find in the account of Bilby and Hodsock. The Manor of Blyth. The manor of Blyth was not included in the original grant to Andrews and Ramsden. The manors of Blyth and Barnby Moor appear to have gone together, and were leased out until the 8th James I., when they were granted to George Salter and John Williams, who in the 16th James I. sold them to Sir Gervase Clifton. On 1 9th and 20th May, 1738, Sir Robert Clifton and Hon. George Wade conveyed to Edward Mellish the manors of Blyth and Barnby Moor with other property. It appears that it was sub sequently discovered, on searching the Crown Rolls, that the manors and tolls were not properly described, and they were in consequence re-conveyed by the following title: \" All that the manor of Blyth with Barnby, otherwise called or known by the names of the manors of Blyth and Barnby Moor, with the rights, members, and appurtenances thereof in the said county of Notting ham: and all those passage tolls of Blyth and Barnby as the same have been usually held and"], [103, "THE FAMILY OF WALKER. 85 enjoyed by the said Sir R.

Joshua Walker, Esq., of Clifton, near Rotherham, who purchased the Blyth estate of Lieut. - Colonel Mellish, in 1806, was the second son of Samuel Walker, the principal founder of the iron works of Masborough. He had three brothers : Samuel (the eldest son) of Masborough; Joseph, of Eastwood and Aston; and Thomas, of Berry Hill; and they were all of them prosperous and opulent men. Joseph was high sheriff of the county of Derby in 1799, and Thomas of the county of Nottingham in 1809. The three younger brothers married sisters, daughters of Samuel Need, Esq., of Nottingham : Joshua of Clifton marrying Susanna, second daughter of that gentleman. From this marriage sprang Henry, eldest child, who married Elizabeth daughter of Edward Abney, Esq., of Measham, and was high sheriff of Notts in 1818; Joshua, some time M.P. for Aldborough; Susanna, who married J. Strutt, Esq., of Belper, first cousin of Edward first Lord Belper; and Frederick, who died in infancy. Henry Walker had issue Henry Frederick, born Sept. 1807, high sheriff of Notts 1852, the present owner of the Blyth Estate, who married, 1833, Miss Howard, and has no surviving issue; Caroline-Elizabeth, who married J. Ashton Case, Esq., of Ince and Summer Hill, in the county of Lancaster, whom she survives; Emily, who married J. S. Lightfoot, Esq., and died 12 February, 1845, leaving no children; and Arthur Abney. Henry Walker, the father of Mr. Henry Frederick Walker, died at Clifton, 19 January, 1860, in the 75th year of his age, his wife having died at the same place in 1850; and if Clifton now passes into other hands, as I believe there is a probability that it will do by sale, the last link by which the Walkers have been so long and so lucratively connected with Rotherham will be broken asunder. The Rectory of the Parish Henry VIII. in his charter of dotation of Trinity College, Cambridge, bearing date the 38th year of his reign, included in his grants to that college \" totam rectoriam et ecclesiam nostram de Blythe in dicto comitatu nostro Nottinghamensi cum suis juribus membris et pertinentiis universis nuper Prioratui sive Monasterio de Blythe in eodem comitatu modo dissoluto dudum spectantibus et pertinentibus.\" The rectory has been leased for terms of years by the college since they came into possession of it up to the year 1856, when their last lease, granted to Mrs. Chambers of Hodsock, expired, and they took it into their own hands. The first lease of the rectory granted to Sir Gervase Clifton of Hodsock, in the 2nd Edward VI. was for seventy years. The next was in the 12th James I. for twenty years, to Sir G. Clifton, and thenceforth the leases were all granted for terms of twenty years in the following order: \u2014"], [104, "86 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. 1618 to Sir Gervase Clifton; 1629, 1636, 1651, 1658, 1665, to Sir Gervase Clifton; 1672 to Mr. Gervase Holland: 1697 to Sir William Clifton; 1686 to Sergeant Bigland; 1693, 1700, to the same; 1707 to John Thomson; 1717 to Mr. Athorp for Sir G.

In 1765 William and Charles Mellish purchased of the Cliftons their interest in the lease of the rectory; and, as appears from the above-given recital, obtained a new lease thereof in 1769. Their family continued lessees till 1856. The College have tithe-rent charges in every township of the parish, with the exception of Barnby Moor, where an allotment of land was set out in lieu of the rectorial tithes to them, as in lieu of the vicarial tithes to the vicar, about fifty years ago. The Parish School of Blyth. I am inclined to think that the parish school-room formed originally a portion of the build - ings of the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist, of which I shall speak more fully under Hodsock, My reasons for entertaining this opinion are, 1. that human remains have been found in consider able abundance, with stone coffins, near it, thus apparently identifying it with the chapel of that institution: 2. that the door-way, in its architectural features, is precisely of the age of King John, when the hospital was founded. The external walls of the school, it is true, are by no means regular or uniform, consisting in some places of good ashlar-work, and in others of inferior ma terials and workmanship; but on examining the outer wall of Richmond Castle, in Yorkshire, in October 1859, which is confessedly ancient work, I found it in some places precisely like the outer walls of Blyth school. The school is endowed with land bequeathed by some benefactor unknown. In 1695 Edward Mellish took a lease of the school land, called then The Marsh, and situated on the right side of the road from Blyth to Nornay, at the hands of John Turner the schoolmaster, at an annual rent of 5/. The Mellish family continued to hold the land at the same unvarying rent till the year 1806, when conceiving that it was part of the Blyth estate, subject to the rent just men tioned, Lieut.-Col. Mellish sold it, together with the rest of the property, to Joshua Walker, Esq. After repeated but ineffectual attempts had been made to induce the new proprietor and his son and successor to restore to the school its unquestionable right, Henry Walker, Esq. made a cession of six acres of land in another part of his estate, which was accepted by the parish in vestry assem bled, October 27, 1815, and confirmed in the award of the Commissioners then executing an Act for the inclosure of lands in the township and liberty of Blyth. The schoolmaster was, till more recent times, duly licensed to his office by the Archbishop of York; and the school being in strict connection with the Church of England, the appointment of the master is vested in the vicar. Property of the Township: Charities: Coxcluding Remarks. The township of Blyth possesses property in land and houses, left by donors in a great measure unknown, which is now let for about 28/. a-year. Included in this rent, however, is the sum of"], [105, "87 PROPERTY OF THE TOWNSHIP : CHARITIES. Al. 5s. which, strange as it may sound, is forced upon the acceptance of the township against its will under the following circumstances: \u2014 Four persons, of the names of Dorothy Barlow, James Ryalls, Thomas Greaves, and Rev. W. Smith, lecturer of All Hallows, Barking, left in the last century the respective sums of 20/. 201. 10/. and 35/. to the poor of the town and parish of Blyth, the interest to be distributed in the shape of doles annually. In process of time the overseers of the poor invested these charities, amounting in all to 85/. in building cottages, the rents of which went to the general poor-rate account of the township, until in 1826, on the recommendation of the Charity Commission, a committee, consisting of the vicar, churchwardens, and others, was appointed to receive the interest of these charities from the overseers of the poor, being Al. 5s. at the rate of 5 per cent, and to apply it agreeably to the bequests of the donors. So matters continued from 1826 to 1856, when the auditor of the Worksop Union disallowed the payment. On appeal to the Poor Law Commissioners they recommended a sale of the town's property, and their recommendation was accepted, on condition that a pledge should be given that the principal, and all arrears of interest of the sum of 85/. should be reserved out of the proceeds of the sale. This pledge the Poor Law Commissioners have up to this time declined to give, and the consequence is that, under the form and name of law, a great injury has been done to the poor. I can only express a hope that until such pledge is given the township will not sanction the sale. Other charities are, a house, homestead, and about five acres of land at Scaftworth, bequeathed by Edward Farfoot in 1728, which were advantageously sold in the last century to the Ackloms of Wiseton, and the proceeds invested in the funds; 40/. by John Crofts in 1759; two cottages and a rent-charge of 10/. per annum by John Seaton, May 15th, 1700, for the habitation and use of a widow of the Church of England, and of a widow of the people called Quakers. Blyth Nornay is, as its name indicates, on the north side of the river, and is a small hamlet, the right-hand side of which as we proceed to Bawtry is in the township of Styrrup, and the left in that of Blyth. The bridge now called Nornay Bridge was formerly known by the name of the Rood Bridge, on which stood a small chapel with a rood, and a priest in ancient times was in attendance to receive the devotions and offerings of travellers. One of the great roads to London from the North lay through Blyth, branching off from the present North Road at Rossington, and falling into it again at Markham Moor. I present my readers with an account of expenses at the Angel Inn, Blyth, in 1274. In that year Robert de Insula, newly-elected Bishop of Durham, went to London in company with the Prior of Durham, Richard Claxton, in order to obtain an interview with the King. They returned in October by way of Blyth; and here is their bill at the inn \u2014 \" In pane, 10s.; in cervisia et vino, 33s. 5d. ; in coquina, 27s. 5\\d.; in prebenda, feno et litera, 18s. 9<i.\" From Blyth the prior sent a person forward with a present of 2s. to the Friars Minor of Doncaster. The town was once probably more populous than it is at the present day. It contained a street or row of houses on the green opposite to the present vicarage; another leading from the church gates towards the Angel Inn; another, Briggate, leading to Blyth Nornay; and one which is an invariable concomitant of all ancient towns and cities, namely, Finkle Street (the street of ale or beer, a public house or inn being there, from the Danish word Jinchal, ftnchle), leading towards the present gates of Blyth Hall. It contained also some inns of a better class, which have disappeared; several shops, which if not of the highest order were of great convenience; and various small freeholds, with houses quite fit for the residences of respectable yeomen, which have"], [106, "88 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. been nearly all gradually absorbed into the possessions of the proprietor of the Blyth estate. To a person who like the writer of these pages has been from earliest days familiarly acquainted with the finest scenery of England from \" Barnard's tower and Tees's stream,\" and Rokeby and \" Brignal banks\" and the Greta, downwards to Wycliffe, Ovington, and Gainford, all Midland scenery must necessarily present a somewhat tame appearance. Still, Midland people themselves and even more distant visitors are always gratified with Blyth, embosomed as it is in rich foliage of elm and ash and sycamore ; crowned at one extremity with a venerable church possessing one of the finest towers in the country, at the other with its ancient school ; with an excellent mansion and a river flanking its pleasure grounds; and attesting in its better houses, its cleanly cottages, its fertile and highly cultivated fields, its excellent roads, and dry soil, the general prosperity, comfort, and contentment of its inhabitants. \u2022 The Apology of Syr Thomas More, knt. made an. 1533, Works, edit. 1557, p. 885 ; Lord Campbell's Life of Sir Thomas More ; Monast.

It is waste. There is one acre of meadow. Pasturable wood one quaranten long and half a quaranten broad. Value in King Edward's time 10s., now I2d. Barnby and Lound occur also conjointly as in some measure being terra regis, and as such owing service to the manor of Bothamsall. Such is the representation given of Barnby Moor in the great national survey of Domesday. The appellation of Barnby admits of a ready explanation. It is the by or town of beorn, an old ante-Norman name. The meaning of the distinctive addition of moor is obvious. The ancient benefactions in this township to the convent of Blyth perpetually speak of \" Mora de Barneby.\" At the Conquest Barnby Moor became part of the great fee of Roger. But in his foundation charter of the monastery of Blyth he gave this township, as we have seen, to the prior and convent. \" Insuper dedi illis quicquid habebam in Barnebeya.\" So that thenceforth they became lords of the manor, and continued so till the destruction of their house. I shall now lay before my readers the substance of a scries of charters of benefactions made to the convent of Blyth in this place. They will be enabled thereby to realise to themselves a very vivid picture of the condition of the district in ancient times. \" 1.

Moreover, it shall be lawful for the said prior and convent to assert (essart, clear) and cultivate the said wood, whenever they please, without obstruction of the said Walter or his heirs: and when the said prior and convent have led away their crops from thence, the said Walter and all the men of the vill shall have common.

To hold of me and my heirs to the said monks and their successors in peace and quietness for ever with all appurtenances, fealties. profits, commodities, revenues, and all escheats which may arise from the said rent.\" These ancient charters enable us to form a very vivid conception of Barnby Moor in times of old. My lord the prior of Blyth has, we see, a large wood which, as we may infer from the tenour of one of these documents, is of great antiquity. It is in all probability the very wood spoken of in the Domesday Survey which has been recited at the beginning of this chapter, and, if so, is at least a mile and a half in length and three quarters of a mile in breadth. Under its oaks, whose tops and branches in every stage of decay present the most varied and picturesque appearance, like those in the hays of Birkland and Bilhagh, in the vicinity of Thoresby and Edwinstow, may be seen cattle depasturing upon its coarse long herbage, or swine feeding upon its fallen acorns. My lord has, too, his forester in his dress of Lincoln green, with his bow and quiver over his shoulder, his baldric round his waist, and his staghound at his heel, now perambulating the open glade, now watching in the thicket, to protect the rights of his master, to ward off intruders, and to bring down any wild deer that may chance to come within arrow shot. There is, moreover, a wild, extensive moor interspersed here and there with green knolls, where the heather and the hare-bell wave in all the native beauty and brilliancy of colour, with which He hath clothed them, who arrays the lilies of the field with a glory surpassing that of the greatest of earth's potentates. The small proprietors, or the free-tenants of the convent, now and then set up an adverse claim in forest and moor: but my lord the prior nevertheless incloses the moor with some cognisable fence or boundary, and they are easily induced for some profitable consideration to cede and quit-claim or compromise their pretensions. He also holds his manorial court, to which his dependents pay suit and service, and with this there is, as usual, united a court leet or view of frank-pledge. n2"], [110, "92 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. The reader will not fail likewise to observe that the convent of Blyth, doubtless like other religious houses, was in the habit of purchasing the properties of indigent owners who might happen to fall into difficulties and wanted ready money, and of advancing money to owners or occupiers upon good and adequate security; and if upon these occasions the religious dealt kindly and liberally with their neighbours and dependents (and we have no reason whatever for supposing the contrary), then verily they fulfilled one great object of their mission, namely, that of charity and mercy. To carry on my history of this ancient manor of the prior and convent of Blyth in unbroken chronological order, I will state that in the report made by the jury at Nottingham of the possessions of Blyth Abbey in the year 1378, the prior is returned as holding at Barnby Moor fourteen bovates of land, each containing sixteen acres, and valued in all at 21. 3s. Ad. yearly; as also eight and a half acres of meadow worth Is. 6d. an acre; and in rents from free tenants and cottagers 1/. 12s. 2d. In the return made 26 Henry VIII. of the property of the convent, we find \" the lordeshipe of Barneby wl other londes and tenements thereto belonginge in Barneby, yearly, 51. 14s.\" The manor of Barnby Moor, as I have shown in the preceding chapter, has always been united with that of Blyth, and remained after the dissolution of the convent of Blyth in the crown till the time of James I. when it was alienated to the Cliftons, who sold it to the Mellishes, from whom it passed to the family of Mr. Walker, the present proprietor of the Blyth estate. I have not been able to discover with absolute certainty what became of the rest of the monastic property here; but we may conjecture with some degree of probability that, inasmuch as the name of Fretwell occurs at the head of the proprietors of this township in 1612, and the Fretwells were from the time of Henry VIII. possessed of Hellaby, in the neighbouring parish of Stainton in Yorkshire, a member o\u00a3 this family it was who, at an early period probably after the destruction of the monastery, purchased the monastic estates at Barnby Moor. After a considerable interval of time, namely, about the middle of the last century, I find the Barkers large proprietors here, as well as at Mattersea, Ranskill, and Torworth. In 1808, John Barker, of the Middle Temple, esq. on his marriage with Caroline Maria Scellier Salis, of Portland Place, entailed the bulk of his estates in Nottinghamshire. He subsequently mortgaged, and eventually sold, his interest in these estates to Henry Dempster Heming, esq.; and in 1842 Mr. Heming offered them for sale. He was entitled to a portion of them in fee simple absolute, and to the residue for the life of Mr. Barker, then fifty -nine years of age, with remainder in fee expectant on his decease without issue male. Mr. Barker had been then married thirty-four years to his wife, whose age then was fifty-four, without issue, so that a purchaser was only subject to the contingency of Mr. Barker leaving a legitimate male descendant, who might attain an age to enable him to bar the remainder in fee, but which he could not effect whilst a minor, nor, after his majority, in his father's lifetime, without the purchaser's own concurrence. The property altogether thus offered for sale, amounted to upwards of 1,700 acres, and the risk was presumed to be, if any, very small. The late Mr. George Clark, of Barnby Moor, and the late Mr. Bradley, of Blyth Spital, were the purchasers of that portion which was situated at Barnby Moor."], [111, "93 RECTORIAL AND VICARIAL GLEBE. The Rectorial and Vicarial Glebe. The tithes of this township, both rectorial and vicarial, were commuted, as already stated, for land about fifty years ago, at the time of the inclosure, chiefly I doubt not through the beneficial influence of those active and intelligent men, the late Mr. George Clark, and his father, the late Mr. John D'Arcy Clark. Bishop Horsley in the last century denounced the policy of commuting tithes for land. \" Nor less fatal (says he) to our order would be any change in the tenure of ecclesiastical property, espe cially the favourite project of an exchange of tithes for an equivalent in land. Many of us here have felt, in some part of our lives, the inconvenience of succeeding to dilapidated houses, with small resources in our private fortunes, and restrained by the circumstances of a predecessor's family from the attempt to enforce our legal claims. But what would be the situation of a clergyman who in coming to a living should succeed to nothing better than a huge dilapidated farm, which would too soon become the real state of every living in the kingdom in which the tithes should have been converted into glebe ? Not to mention the extinction of our spiritual character, and the obvious inconveniences to the yeomanry of the kingdom, which would be likely to take place, should this new manner of our maintenance send forth the spirit of farming among the rural clergy.\" With great deference to the authority of this very eminent and able prelate, I would submit that it by no means followed that the clergy should become farmers, (for of course they might have let their glebe lands either voluntarily, or, as at present, under legal compulsion, to tenants,) or that their estates should necessarily be converted into \" huge dilapidated farms.\" But now, at all events, since the commutation of tithes and the establishment of free trade in corn, it cannot I think be denied that it would be for the advantage of the clergy if their endowments consisted in land instead of rent charges. As matters stand at this day, their benefices are dependent entirely upon the price of grain; and it has frequently happened that when corn has been low, other com modities, such as wool and cattle, have commanded high prices. And hence landlords, since the days of free trade commenced, have been enabled to let their farms at as high, nay in many cases higher rents than before. Of course a landed benefice would share in the advantages of a landed estate. Barnby Moor, standing on the great North road from London to Edinburgh, and possessing an excellent inn, exhibited in bygone days, before the construction of our railroads, continued life and animation. Even at this day it is a remarkably neat and well-conditioned village, possessing several good houses, and many excellent and intelligent inhabitants, whom I have the happiness of numbering among my parishioners; and enjoying the somewhat rare distinction of the entire absence of a conventicle. BlLBY. Bilby is incorporated with Barnby Moor in the payment of rates and taxes, and therefore must be treated of here. The Domesday Survey states that \" in Billebi Grimchel had six bovates of land to be taxed. Land three carucates.

Value in King Edward's time 40s. ; now 20s.\" Thoroton imagines, upon what authority I know not, that this Ingram was the ancestor of the lords of Alfreton. Of his descendants William Fitz-Ranulph was a benefactor of the Abbey of Welbeck, giving the abbot and canons the mill of Bilby.* The daughter of William, Isabella, married John de Orreby. Orreby and Thurstan Dispensator (Spenser) are recorded as holding, under Alice the Countess of Eu, one third part and a twelfth part of a knight's fee in Bilby ; this eminent lady herself holding direct from the Crown of the old fee. Subsequently the Chaworths appear as proprietors in Bilby ; and it would appear that they sold their interest there to Sir William Hewet, who was an opulent merchant in London, and Lord Mayor of the city in 1559; who purchased estates at Barking in Essex, at Wales in Yorkshire, the place of his birth, and also at Harthill : and from whose relatives descended the Hewets of Shire oaks. Sir William Hewet had an only daughter, to whom the following romantic accident befel, which I must give in the quaint and graphic words of Stowe, premising merely that Hewet was a cloth worker, and had a house on London Bridge. \" The maid playing with her out of a window over the river Thames, by chance dropt her in, almost beyond expectation of being saved. A young gentleman named Osborne, then apprentice to Sir William the father (which Osborne was one of the ancestors of the Duke of Leeds in a direct line), at this calamitous accident immediately lept in bravely and saved the child. In memory of which deliverance, and in gratitude, her father afterwards bestowed her in marriage on the said Mr. Osborne, with a very great dowry.\" Of this dowry the estates at Bilby, Barking, Wales, and Harthill formed a portion. Stowe adds, that \" several persons of quality courted the said young lady, and particularly the Earl of Shrewsbury. But Sir William was pleased to say, Osborne saved her and Osborne should enjoy her.'' Osborne himself was a merchant, and Lord Mayor of London in 1582, in which year he was knighted. He was one of the Members of Parliament for the City in 1585. f The son and heir of this Edward Osborne, viz. Sir Edward Osborne, Bart., sold the Bilby property to Sir Gervase Clifton, of Clifton and Hodsock, Bart. * This William must have been the brother or son of Robert Fitzranulph, of eternal infamy, who followed the four murderers of Becket into Canterbury Cathedral, and who immediately after the murder resigned the shrievalty of Nottingham and Derby, which he had held for the six preceding years, and founded the priory of MBeauchief in atonement of his crime. William, the son of Robert, and probably the very person mentioned above, succeeded to his father's office, aud was about the court till the reign of John. There is or was living somewhere in the Midland counties a person who claimed descent from one of the murderers of Becket, and prided himself upon the connection. The pride of ancestry is inherent in the human breast. The late Mr. O'Connell used to declare of a living statesman, that he was lineally descended from the impenitent thief.

In 1697 he sold to Levinz the royalties of Bilby and Ranby. In 1734 the Levinzes are described as being of Grove in the county of Nottingham. In 1748 indentures of lease and release were executed between William Levinz the younger; the Hon. Morgan Vane, second son of the Right Hon. Gilbert, second Lord Barnard, of Barnard Castle in the county of Durham, Robert Knight (then Lord Luxborough), Honorable Henry Vane, elder brother of Morgan Vane, afterwards first Earl of Darlington, John Page, and John Evelyn, esquires, whereby Levinz conveyed for the sum of 5,500/. property in the parishes of Bab worth and Blyth, including Bilby, to the above-named Morgan Vane, who in his marriage settle ment in 1731 with Margaretta Knight, is described as being of St. Martin's in the Fields, and who was known in Nottinghamshire and probably elsewhere by the honorary distinction of \" His Honour Vane.\" His motives for settling in Nottinghamshire must of course be matter of conjec ture. But it is by no means improbable that he was induced to do so by the fact of his possessing relatives in the immediate neighbourhood of Bilby; for his grandmother had been a sister of John Holies, of Haughton, fourth Earl of Clare, and eventually Duke of Newcastle, succeeding in this second title to his father-in-law Henry Cavcn,dish.* Twenty years had scarcely elapsed before his Honour Vane parted with a very considerable portion of this property; for in 1768 he sold a large part of his estate, which was situated in the parish of Babworth, to William Mellish, Esq. of Blyth Hall. It was known by the name of Ranbv Forest, containing by estimation fourteen hundred acres, and having Barnby fields on the north, lands of W. Simpson, Esq. on the south and east, and the Nottingham road on the west. With it were sold the manor and royalty of Ranby. By his first wife, Margaretta Knight, Hon. Morgan Vane had a son Morgan, who was three times married, his third wife being niece of his second, and the law at that time admitting such alliances. On his third marriage, M. Vane, junior, settled all his property on his wife Catharine Brookes. Within two years of his death she married Mr. John Dore, and on her marriage settled the Bilby estate on trusts, by which in the event the children of her second husband were equally benefited with those of her first. By the trustees under this marriage settlement the estate of Bilby was sold in 1801 to Francis Ferrand Foljambe, Esq. for the sum of 21,000/. Some members of this family, I am informed, resided at Bilby Hall in the early part of this century. It is now, and has for some years been, uninhabited. * The Vanes were originally a Kentish family, and purchased the confiscated estates of Ralph Neville, Eari of Westmerland, in the county of Durham, in the beginning of the 17th century.

Have issue. * Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring ; And Sedley cursed the form that pleased the King. I have a word to say with regard to the rectorial and vicarial tithes of Bilby. The property consists of about six hundred and seventy acres. I am confining myself strictly to the parish of Blyth. The rectorial tithes are commuted for 10/. per annum; the vicarial for 4s. The late Mr. John D'Arcy Clark of Barnby Moor, then an octogenarian, informed me in the year 1835 that he could well remember the time when the sum of 101. was the full value of the great tithes of Bilby. He of course referred to a period when the country around us was more like a barren forest than a cultivated and productive inclosure. The plea therefore that this is a good and valid modus reaching back to the age of Richard I. entirely falls to the ground. The simple fact is, that when this rent of 101. was first agreed upon, some seventy or eighty years ago, it was, as Mr. Clark informed me, a just representation of the value of the great tithes; but from great and culpable neglect on the part of Trinity College, or their lessee, or both, the rent was permitted to glide on"], [115, "97 RECTORIAL AND VICARIAL TITHES OF BILBY. year after year unaltered; and thus it came to pass that, when the commutation of tithes was effected, the estate of Bilby escaped the incidence of a full and adequate rent-charge under cover of Lord Tenterden's Act, and 10Z. instead of 23AI. 10s. is paid out of it in lieu of rectorial tithes. The munificent sum of 4s. instead of 501. is paid to the vicar for vicarial tithes, originating doubtless in precisely the same circumstances as those under which the payment of the 10/. above named took its rise. If ever Bilby should be sold, and What's property, dear Swift? you see it alter From you to me, from me to Peter Walter. then truly the line of Horace might be very fairly urged as a recommendation to purchasers, Est modus in rebus : sunt certi denique fines which used to be thus translated by Burke : \u2014 There is a modus upon the estate and sines certain I gladly quit this noxious air for a more wholesome and invigorating atmosphere Reg.

My history of Torworth shall commence with a night scene at Serlby Mill. \" Know all men, present and to come, that I, Robert, son of Sibill de Moles, have given and granted, and by this my charter have quit-claimed, to Hugh de Moles and his heirs or assigns one acre of marsh in Lundesker, that is to say, that acre which my mother gave in perpetual homage and service : and that acre lies between Master Hugh and Agnes de Karleton : and one rood of land on the brechs between the aforesaid Hugh and Agnes, in consideration of a quarrel which we have had over a night's fishing at Serlebi Mill : to have and to hold of me, my heirs and assigns, unto the said Hugh and his heirs or assigns, freely, quietly, peaceably, and entirely in fee and inheritance for his fealty and service, &c. &c. Witnesses, Hugh of Harewood : Hingeram of Stirap : William of Kelishold : Gilfrid of Blith of Serlebi : Simon the miller of the same vill : Robert Gabi of Torworthe, and many others.\" By a careful comparison of the deed from which I have taken this extract, and which, like other coeval documents, is without date, with charters of precisely the same character of hand writing, and the age of which, from other circumstances, can be well ascertained, I entertain little doubt that it was drawn up in the twelfth century. Whether Robert de Moles had set up a counter claim to this particular piece of ground, and had been fishing upon it : or whether he and his party had come into violent collision with Master Hugh and his men, and had ill-treated them: or finally whether the dispute was simply as to whose property the night's take was \u2014 and the ground was ceded or presented as a peace-offering in consequence, it would be fruitless, as it is immaterial, to inquire. But the fishing scene at Serlby Alill introduces us at once to ancient and powerful names. It may be observed that the earliest and best authenticated information bearing upon the ancient proprietors of the parish, with the exception of course of Domesday Survey, is to be derived from the Chartulary of our monastery, to which they were nearly all of them benefactors. I shall therefore here introduce such notices of the Family of Moles as the charters of the convent supply, and which embody matters of interest to which I shall subsequently advert. It will only be necessary to premise that this family received from Roger Mowbray in the twelfth century the grant of Serlby, with which Torworth was united. \" 1. Be it known, &c. that I Hugh de Molis have given to the church and monks of S. Mary"], [117, "99 MOWBRAY AND MOLES. of Blyth in pure and perpetual alms five bovates of land and a half with all their appurtenances in Tordeord, that is to say, two bovates and a half which Osbert held, and one bovate which Reginald held, and one bovate which Robert held, and one bovate which my mother held in the same vill, with this condition, that the children of Henry de Bilbi shall hold the said land of the said monks by right of inheritance, paying to them one pound of pepper yearly at the fair of Blyth. And I wish it to be known that I have made this grant to Henry's children in payment of eight marks which I owed to them by the devise of their father. \" 2. Know all men, &c. that I Hugh de Moles have given and quit-claimed to God and St. Mary of Blyth and the monks there serving God, Robert the son of Siward, who was my vassal and native: and that my heirs may not invalidate or revoke my grant I have confirmed this charter with my seal.* \" 3. Know, &o. that I Hugh de Moles, through instinctive feelings of charity, have re nounced and quit-claimed to the church of St. Mary of Blyth all claim which I had to the use of Ginet Magnus of Blyth, and Thomas Leman, and all his brothers and his sister, and all their off spring present and to come. This claim I quit-claimed in the presence of the justiciaries of our Lord the King of England, that is to say, Hubert Walter and others at Blyth, who were with him at that time when the Kino* ordered them to collect the tenths throughout England. \" 4. Know, &c. that I Matilda de Moles, in my widowhood and in my own liege power, have granted, &c. to Robert de Kelesalt, for his homage and service, the farm of those three acres of land which Roger Knodi holds of me in the fields of Torrcwrd ; and all the service which out of those three acres he owed to me or my heirs, without any drawback \u2014 he paying me yearly at Pentecost one penny for all services, customs, and demands.\" From the first of these documents we see that the convent acted in the capacity of trustees to the children of Henry de Bilbi. Hugh Moles had borrowed money of him : and he gives certain lands to the convent in trust for the benefit of his family. The second charter shows us that this land of freedom once contained slaves. Robert, the son of Siward, had been born a slave, being in the same condition with his father. He was a nativus, and belonged to his master, and by him might be disposed of like any other of his goods and chattels. This born slave was handed over by Moles to the convent of Blyth, like those mentioned in the following charter, and by the prior and monks employed in menial services. In the next document we obtain a glimpse of the chivalrous days of Richard I., and are enabled to fix the precise year, namely 1193, when the transaction took place. In this year the lion-hearted king, on his return from Palestine, was taken prisoner at Vienna by Leopold Duke of Austria, and handed over to Henry VI. the emperor of Germany, who kept him in close confine ment. Now the imprisonment of the superior lord was one of those cases in which the aid of his vassals could be demanded. The emperor consented to release the captive sovereign for the ran som of 150,000 marks; and to raise this enormous amount of money, twenty shillings were levied on each knight's fee in England ; the wealthy churches and monasteries melted down their plate to the amount of 30,000 marks ; the bishops, abbots, and nobles paid one-fourth part of then yearly rents, and the clergy contributed one-tenth of their tithes. The full amount being col- * The name Hugh \u2014 Hugo \u2014 is accidentally omitted in the original; but the charter is headed \"Carta Ilugonis de Moles.\" 0 2"], [118, "100 HISTORY OF THE PARISn OP BLYTH. lected, Queen Eleanor, attended by the great functionary Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, and chief Justitiary of England,* mentioned in the charter, set out for Germany and set the King at liberty. It was upon this great stirring national emergency, therefore, that Hugh de Moles appeared before the justitiary at Blyth and made the surrender above described. But why did he select this particular occasion for so doing? I have a strong suspicion that he received from the convent at Blyth an equivalent in money for the so-called gift and concession which he had made to them, and that he was therewith enabled to satisfy the demand made upon his property by way of con tribution to the ransom of his sovereign. He appears to have been a needy man, and at the same time able and ready-witted ; for we have seen him turning the misunderstanding about the fishing at Serlby Mill to good account; we have seen him in debt and obliged to mortgage (so to speak) some portion of his Torworth estate ; and now upon a great public occasion he hands over some of his vassals to the prior of Blyth \u2014 not, I think, without a consideration. The contemplation of the ancient history and condition of our country, national and social, is ever attended with peculiar attraction and interest ; and the elucidation of ancient men and manners is no where better and more vividly presented than in instruments such as those which we have now before us: and for this reason that it is given, not professedly, but incidentally only, and i/c irapepyov. Let me now pursue my history. In the somewhat vague and unsatisfactory language of Thoroton (iii. 429), \" Roger de Mowbray gave the manor of Serleby in the time of king John, or before, to Matilda de Moles,\" a lady who will presently come under our notice again. Now we know that after the rebellion of Robert de Belesme, Earl of Shrewsbury, who had received from Rufus the possessions of his kinsman Roger de Builli, the great Norman lord of this part of the country, Henry I. resumed those possessions into his own hands. He did not long retain them, for Nigel de Albini, who in 1118 married Gundred de Gournay, the great-grand daughter of the Conquerer, and is recorded to have been possessed of one hundred and forty knight's fees in England, received, probably, a portion of de Builli's estates in Nottinghamshire, inasmuch as we find his son Roger conferring upon the family of de Moles the manor of Serlby (formerly the fee of de Builli), with which that of Torworth also has been coupled from the earliest period. Thus, in the 10th John, a charter is recited by which Matilda de Moles gives to the Abbot and Convent of Roche all the lands which the men of Blyth held of Hugh her brother, and afterwards of herself, in the fields of Serlby and Torworth. And the jury who were summoned for the purpose of investigating titles and redressing grievances in the 29th Edward I. pronounced that Huo-h de Serlby, who was descended from Matilda above-named, held the manor of Serlby with Torworth by military service from Roger Mowbray, then dead. The house of Mowbray was one of those mighty satellites which revolved around the throne with a power and a brilliancy but little inferior to those of the great central source of might and honour \u2014 the sovereign himself \u2014 now intermarrying with the blood-royal of England \u2014 now founding splendid religious houses \u2014 now standing in the vanguard of battle in defence of their sovereign \u2014 * In the reign of Richard I.

It is somewhat difficult to discriminate between the two ; but I believe the Archbishop of Rouen is the person mentioned in our charter."], [119, "101 THE FAMILY OF MOWBRAY. now bearding their sovereign to the face in open rebellion \u2014 Earls of Arundel \u2014 Earls of Nottingham \u2014 Earls Marshal \u2014 Dukes of Norfolk. They sprang by the female side from Amicia de Mowbray, who married Roger de Albini, and was sister of Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, who rebelled against Rufus, and died in Windsor Castle after an imprisonment of thirty years. The son of Roger and Amicia, Nigel de Albini \u2014 the bow-bearer of Rufus \u2014 married, as I have stated above, Gundred de Gournay, the great-granddaughter of the Conqueror, (being the granddaughter of William Earl of Warren and Surrey, Lord of Conisborough Castle, and Gundred his wife, the daughter of the Conqueror,) and from that marriage sprang Roger, who by command of Henry I. took the name and arms of Mowbray. This mighty man espoused the side of Stephen in his contest with the Empress Maud, and, in conjunction with those powerful Barons of Yorkshire, William Albemarle, Walter Espec, Ilbert Laci, William Percy and others, and William Peverel and Geoffrey Halsaline of Nottinghamshire, fought at the battle of the Standard, near North allerton, in 1138, against David, King of Scotland. Subsequently he was taken prisoner, with his sovereign, Stephen, at the battle of Lincoln. In the cessation of strife between Stephen and Matilda, which England enjoyed in 1148, Mowbray, Warren his relative, and others, finding no opportunity for the exercise of their military prowess at home, joined the Crusade under the Emperor Conrade and Louis VII. King of France, in which the flower of the English and French nobility fell, and 200,000 men were killed. Mowbray was manifestly a man of deep religious enthusiasm. To the Order of Knights Templars he was so munificent a benefactor, that they arc said to have conferred upon him the distinguished honour of pardoning any brother who had transgressed the rules of their body, provided he appeared before their benefactor and confessed his offence. But he was in fact a most munificent patron of the Church at large, being the founder of the Monastery of the Cistercians at Byland, near Helmsley, of the Priory of Black Canons at Newborough in the same locality, and of the Preceptory of Knights Templars at Balsall, in Warwickshire. His possessions at Slingsby, Gilling East, Thirsk, and in the Isle of Axholme, were very large. In the revolt of the sons of Henry II. against their father Mowbray took arms against his sovereign, and commenced his treasonable operations at Thirsk castle. The King, however, as we know from history, proved master, and nothing was left for Mowbray, Ferrers, Bigod, and others, but to surrender their fortresses and throw themselves on the clemency of their sovereign. If the statement be correct that Roger Mowbray made a second expedition to the Holy Land, this second expedition was made in 1188. Saladin had mounted the throne of Egypt, had vanquished the Christians of Palestine, and obtained possession of Jerusalem. These disastrous tidings spread dismay throughout Western Christendom. Pope Gregory VIIL, Henry II. of England, Philip of France, and the Emperor Frederic I. entered into a confederacy to rescue the Holy City, and to relieve the Christians in the East. No effort, no argument was spared which could rouse the indignation or inflame the ambition of young and old. And although Mowbray was then in all probability on the verge of seventy, he again assumed the cross. There is some discrepancy in the accounts of the termination of this great man's career. Some say that he died in the East, and was interred at Sures. Others that he was taken prisoner, but being redeemed by the Knights Templars, returned home, died in advanced years, at the very close probably of the twelfth, if not in the thirteenth century, and was buried in Byland Abbey, near the Lady Gundred his mother, after having lived and played a most prominent part in eventful times, and leavin\""], [120, "102 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. behind him a name and a renown which the civil and ecclesiastical annals of Eno-land will never permit to perish. At the risk of incurring the charge of a want of gallantry towards Matilda de Moles, to whom, however, I shall very shortly return, I cannot resist the temptation of pursuing the history of this powerful family, though in a very summary manner, into succeeding generations \u2014 more especially as we shall find their name in course of time linked with that of our own shire. Roger Mowbray then married Alice de Gaunt, who was very probably the daughter or sister of that Gilbert de Gaunt, in his wife's right Earl of Lincoln, who founded the Cistercian abbey of Rufford in 1148. They had two sons, Nigel and Robert, the elder of whom espoused Mabel, daughter of the Earl of Clare, and had four sons, William, Philip, Robert, and Roger. William was the ancestor of the Mowbrays and Howards, both in succession Dukes of Norfolk. Philip married Galiena, the daughter of the Earl of Dunbar, and with her received the baronies of Barnbougle and Dalmeny, in the county of Linlithgow, and Inverkeithing in Fifeshire ; and was the ancestor of a long and eminent line of men. I return to William Mowbray.

From him de scended in succession three generations of John Lord Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, and Duke of Norfolk, the last of the three having also received from Henry VI. the revived title of Earl of Warren and Surrey, which his ancestors had enjoyed in bygone ages. 2. Margaret, who married Sir Robert Howard, Knight (who sprang from the Howards of Wigenhall, in Norfolk), and whose only son Sir John Howard adhered to the House of York ; distinguished himself in the French wars of Henry VI; was by Edward IV. made in 1461 constable of the castle of Norwich; in 1470 was summoned to Parliament as Lord Howard, and made Captain- General of the Fleet for"], [121, "103 THE FAMILIES OF MOLES AND SERLBY. resisting the Lancastrians; and finally, 28 June, 1483, was by Richard III. created Earl Marshal of England and Duke of Norfolk, and his son Thomas, Earl of Surrey. Subsequently he was con stituted Lord Admiral, and received very large grants of lands in the counties of Suffolk, Kent, Cornwall, Cambridge, Somerset, and Wilts. He fell by the side of Richard III. at Bosworth; the well-known distich having the night before the battle been affixed to his tent : Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold, For Dickon thy master is bought and sold. 3. Isabel, who married James Lord Berkeley. My limits will not permit me to follow the fortunes of the illustrious lineage of Mowbray and Howard beyond this point. Suffice it for me to invite the attention of my readers to these general statements. 1. The first Duke of Norfolk was a Mowbray. 2. The present noble houses of Norfolk, Carlisle, and Effin\"ham are all descended through the female side from Margaret Mowbray. 3. Three of the four quarterings of the Norfolk arms are three lions with label for Plantagenet, cheeky for Warren, lion rampant for Mowbray \u2014 insignia which likewise enter into the Carlisle shield. Descent of the Manor of Serlby avith Torworth through the Families of Moles and Serlby to those of Saunderson and Monckton. I return to the family of de Moles. A lady of this name, Matilda de Moles, is stated by Thoroton to have received the lordship of Serlby with Torworth from Roger Mowbray, in the time of John or before. It was certainly before, as the charters above recited abundantly testify. In what precise relation she stood to Sibilla and her son Robert, mentiniird at the beginning of this chapter, I am not able to state. I think it however probable that she was the lady to whom the instruments) refers; that she was the mother of Hugh, who has already appeared before us, and of Matilda; that Hugh died without issue, and that his sister succeeded him and married Hugh de Serleby. Both families, that of Moles and that of Serlby, had, we may conjecture, been settled for some time on the spot, possibly as tenants under some immediate sub-infeudatury of the lord paramount, who had passed away, and the former had ingratiated themselves with the house of Mowbray, and from them received a grant of the manor. Be this as it may, from the marriage of Matilda de Moles with Hugh of Serlby sprang no less than twelve heirs male, who became in twelve successive generations lords of the manor of Serlby with Torworth. They possessed the property for five centuries. They enjoyed a chapel of their own at Serlby, and although they have left no historic name or achievements behind them, the great and substantial distinctions \u2014 the nobilitas sola atque unica \u2014 of virtue were theirs, for without them they could not have endured through such a lengthened period of time. One connection of distinction at least the family formed. Ankarcta Serlby, about the time of Edward IV., married Thomas Chaworth, a member of the Anncsley and Wiverton family of Chaworth, from whom descended Lord Chaworth. The family of Serlby not only however held Serlby of the Mowbrays, but Harthill also, in Yorkshire, of the Bardolfs, who claimed kindred blood with the Mowbrays, being descended from Reginald de Warren, the second son of William de Warren, Earl of Surrey, and Gundred, daughter of the Conqueror; and it was probably this connection between these two great houses which"], [122, "104 HISTORY OP THE PARISH OP BLTTH. obtained for them the latter manor. They had a mansion at Harthill, which stood where the present hall now stands, on the north side of the churchyard. Anthony Serlby, who died at Harthill October 13, 1588, left both Harthill and Serlby for life and twenty-one years after to his wife Gertrude, whose grandfather John Leake of Hasland was the brother of Elizabeth the wife of John Hardwick of Hardwick, the parents of Elizabeth the celebrated Countess of Shrewsbury. Gertrude Serlby, the widow, married Sir George Chaworth, who succeeded to the property of the Serlbys at Harthill and resided there. Another Sir George Chaworth was made Viscount Chaworth of Armagh. To him Harthill appears to have come on the death of Gertrude Lady Chaworth, about 1623; and it was sold in 1674 by Grace Viscountess Chaworth, daughter of John Duke of Rutland, and relict of Patrick the last Lord Chaworth, to Thomas Earl of Danby, who was afterwards created Marquis of Caermarthen and Duke of Leeds. Juliana, daughter and heir of the last Lord Chaworth, married Chambre Brabazon, Earl of Meath, in which family the title of Lord Chaworth is now vested. With respect to the fate of Serlby and Torworth I have not so brilliant a story to tell. It is quite clear that the Serlbys had gradually descended in the social scale since the death of Anthony Serlby, if not before, like many another ancient and good family in the kingdom at large, and even in this shire and locality. The consequence was, that in 1627 Thomas Serlby, who describes himself as of Pule-hill, in the parish of Silkston, and who was probably cousin or half-cousin of Anthony Serlby, sold Serlby with Torworth to William Saunderson of Blyth, the elder brother of Bishop Saunderson, the pedigree of whose family has already been given. The deed of sale bears date April 3, 1627, and conveys \" all the manors of Serlby, Torworth, and Farworth, the capital messuage called Serlby Hall, two water-mills, together with all manorial rights and privileges in Serlby, Torworth, Farworth, Wiseton, Mattersay, Scrooby, Styrrup, Olcotes, Nornay, and Harworth, and all lands and rents in the same or elsewhere in the county of Nottingham.\" The purchase money was 860<!. And now another decayed family comes upon the stage. The Mortons were \" an ancient and worshipful family\" settled at Martin and Bawtry. They are traceable up to the middle of the thirteenth century, or even higher still. One of them, Robert, was escheator for the county of Nottingham, and knight of the shire from 1361 to 1393, and gave 2501., a very large sum in those days, to the prior and convent of Nostel, on condition that they should pay an annual pension of eight marks to the chaplain of the hospital of St. Mary Magdalene, near Bawtry. At the Reforma tion they adhered to the old faith, and one of them is said to have been sent from Rome to promulgate the papal bull excommunicating Queen Elizabeth, About 1612 Anthony Morton of Martin, the father, and George and Robert his sons, had granted leases for fifteen years to Nicholas Saunderson, Viscount Castleton ; for sixty years to Simon Dobson and Thomas Coulson; and for two hundred years to John Clifton. On Jan. 8, 1627-8, Robert Morton, his father and brother being dead, sells for AAOl. to William Saunderson of Blyth abovenamed, and Robert Saunderson his son and heir, the manor and lordship of Harworth, comprising those farms in the occupation of John Wagstaffe, Samuel Tomson, and Humfrey Glover, and all the usual appurtenances of a manor; the Saundersons stipulating within three months after the surrender or cancelling of Clifton's lease to pay to Morton 200?. \"at or in the south porch of the parish church of Blyth;\" and as long as they"], [123, "105 THE FAMILY OF SAUNDERSON keep it unpaid to pay in the porch of Harworth Church 1 1 Z. at the feasts of Pentecost and St. Martin. The deed of transfer was executed at East Retford January 11th, 1628, before Sir Gervase Clifton, Bart., and Francis Thornhagh, Esq., two of his majesty's justices of the peace. Although Harworth does not fall within the limits of my history, I have deemed it not irrelevant to mention this conveyance of the manor from the Mortons to the Saundersons, inasmuch as from this date it has come down incorporated with the manors of Serlby and Torworth under one proprietor. But William Saundcrson appears at best to have been nothing more than a mere speculator, and to have lived by expedients. No sooner hardly does he obtain possession than he mortgages to Robert Mellish, who had married his daughter Mary, the manors and lands of Serlby, Torworth, and Farworth. The mortgage was executed on the 8th August, 1627. There is little doubt that o Cj o ' Mellish advanced the purchase money, and took a mortgage of the property. In 1635 Robert Mellish enfeoffs these three estates, not to William Saunderson however, but to his son Robert, and his son's wife, and to his grandson Robert. Now it was in this very year that old Saunderson sold Blyth to John Mellish, the brother of Robert above named, so that there is apparent foundation for the statement put upon record by the Mellishes in the last century that William Saunderson \" purchased Serlby of Robert Mellish with the money which he had received from John Mellish,\" irv other words, that the sale of Blyth enabled him to pay off the mortgage upon Serlby. To complete the story of William Saunderson's pecuniary transactions, I may state that in 1642, August 9th (being then described as \"of Styrrup\"), he mortgaged to William Mellish of Stepney, the brother of John and Robert, the manor of Harworth; but in 1653 the estates are declared unencumbered, and on the 23rd June of that year Saunderson (then \"of Serlby\") and Robert his grandson appoint Edward Stanhope of Grimston, Charles Hall of Kettlcthorpe, Edward Gill of Carr House, and Reason Mellish of Ragnall, Esqrs., and Robert Thorpe of Clay worth, Gent., trustees to execute the provisions of settlement of a marriage shortly to take place between Robert Saunderson and Mary daughter of Very Rev. Anthony Topham, D.D., Dean of Lincoln and Rector of Clayworth. The provisions of the trust are \u2014 that the manors of Serlby, Torworth, Farworth, and Harworth (with the exception of four specified farms), arc settled on Robert and his wife for their joint lives, and for that of the survivor; then in tail male; and, failing male issue, on the daughters (if any); but that if Robert marries again, and has issue male, fortunes shall be given to the daughters of the first wife as follows, viz.: 1,000*!. if only one; 6001. each, if two; if more, then 1,500/. to be equally divided among them; and, failing all male issue, the estates shall go to the daughters in equal portions. William Saunderson reserves a portion of Harworth (that is probably the four farms just referred to) for himself during his own life. The issue of this marriage were Robert, Anthony, and Mary. The sons left no children behind them. Mary Saunderson therefore eventually succeeded to the Serlby estates. She died a spinster; but she has left behind her a name which, together with that of one of her faithful servants, is embalmed in the grateful memory of the poor of Harworth, Styrrup, and Serlby. That domestic is Robert Brailsford her cook, who died in 1701, and was buried at Harworth, having invested his little property, the fruit of his faithful service and praiseworthy economy, in the purchase of an estate at Sykehouse in the parish of Fishlakc, which, together with a school and schoolmaster's house at Harworth, he left in the hands of trustees, for the education and clothing of the poor in the above townships. In order doubtless to streuothen this i*"], [124, "106 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. benevolent and thoughtful man's pious benefaction, Mrs. Mary Saunderson, his mistress, left by will a rent-charge of 201. to issue out of the Serlby estate, and to be applied in furtherance of the same objects. Since their days the trust has been faithfully executed by gentlemen and clergymen of the neighbourhood, who have acted as trustees; and who may enumerate the advantages which the bounty of Mary Saunderson and Robert Brailsford has conferred upon the poor during the last five generations, or which may accrue to them for generations yet to come? Verily, for such ancestors as these the beautiful aspiration of the poet is surely permissible : Di raajorum umbris tenuem et sine pondere terram Spirantesque crocos et in urna perpetuuin ver Qui pr\u00e6ceptorem sancti voluere parentis Esse loco ! Excellent person, however, as I believe Mary Saunderson to have been, she, like other preceding members of her family, was in pecuniary difficulties. In the last five years of her life she mortgaged her property deeply. In her last will and testament, dated January 20th, 1723, she appoints William Thornton of Bloxham, Benjamin Wilcock of the Middle Temple, Mary Vincent of Doncaster spinster, and Elizabeth Stowe, late of Serlby, then of Barlborough, her executors ; and Isabella the wife of the Rev. Joseph Crompton, Rector of Normanton upon Soar, Anne the wife of Henry Dunston of Worksop, Margaret Vincent, and Catharine Vincent, all daughters of Thomas Vincent, late of Barnborough Grange, then of Worksop, her residuary legatees. She bequeaths her property, personal and real, to the said Thomas Vincent, whom she calls her cousin, for his life, and after his death to his four daughters in equal portions. She died December 8th, 1724, in the sixty-seventh year of her age, and was buried at Harworth on the 11th of the same month. In 1725, June 24, her executors and the other parties interested convey to John Monckton, Esq. of Hodroyd, the manors or lordships of Serlby alias Serlaby, Torworth, Farworth, and Har worth; as well as all the Saunderson property in Blyth, Ranskill, Mattersea, Wiseton, Styrrup, Olcotes, Nornay, and Scrooby, containing in all eight hundred and forty-six acres sixteen perches, together with \" the yearly chief rents belonging to the said manor of Torworth, amounting to 17s. Id. yearly: and the chief rents of the manor of Harworth, 6 s. 8ii. yearly: chief rents of Torworth, 4s. 8d. yearly: and the yearly rent of 4s. payable for Bawtry Hospital: and all other the chief rents, services, moors, commons, wastes, and waste grounds, courts leet, courts-baron, perquisites, and profits of courts and leets, waifes, estrays, goods, waived goods, and chattels of felons and fugitives and felons of themselves, deodands, herriots, reliefs, escheats, &c. unto the said manors and lands belonging.\" '^> Thomas Vincent above named was, I may remark in passing, descended from the Vincents of Braithwell and Barnborough Grange, one of whom, John Vincent, was agent to the Duke of York, and fell with his master at the battle of Wakefield in 1460. He married Isabel, daughter of Philip Packer of Groombridge, in Kent, Esq. and died in 1726, aged 76, and was buried at Barnborough, leaving behind him three sons and eight daughters, of whom Isabella, Anne, Margaret, and Catharine above mentioned were four. Isabella married Rev. Joseph Crompton, Rector of Norman ton-upon-Soar; Anne, Henry Dunston of Worksop, Esq.; Margaret, in 1735, Robert Earl of Carnwath ; and Catharine, George Nevill of Thorney, Esq."], [125, "107 TORWORTH UNDER THE MONCEMTONS. Torworth under the Moncktons. Having once formed the nucleus of this important property, the Moncktons continued from time to time to expand it, as opportunities presented themselves. Thus, in 1735, John Monck ton, Viscount Galway, the original purchaser, bought of William Watmough eighteen acres of land in Torworth, subject to the annual payment of 10s. to the poor. In 1741, the same noble lord purchased from James Wrigglesworth of Torworth and Mary his wife, a cottage, &c. and four acres of land in the same township, bordering upon the estate of Mr. John Cromwell, hereafter to be treated of: and in 1749 he again enlarged his Torworth estate by the purchase from William Wright of Normanton, near Hough-on-the-Hill, in the county of Lincoln, a messuage, and about forty-seven acres of land. But the most important addition made by the Moncktons to their Torworth property was in 1753, when, on the 26th July, William second Viscount Galway purchased for the sum of three thousand pounds from William Cromwell and his wife, who are described as then residing at Derby, and who became entitled under the will of John Cromwell the grandfather of William, three several farms, viz. the Whitehouse Farm, consisting of one hundred and seventy-three acres, in the occupation of Elizabeth Ramsden, a second in the occupation of John Nettleship, comprising one hundred and sixteen acres, and a third occupied by William Johnson, consisting of thirty-nine acres, together with three cottages. These were formerly in five farms, and were occupied by John Champion, Joseph Marland, John Pagdin, Edward Nettleship, and Richard Robinson, being designated by the names of the Shaw Farm, Hill's Farm, Baxter's Farm, Stansield Farm, and Whitehouse Farm, the last of which had long previously been occupied by and formerly been the property of Lyonel Revell. John Cromwell, of whom I have spoken, is described in his marriage settlement, dated June 8, 1658, as \" of Clayworth, clerk.\" He married, for his first wife, Mary, the daughter of Ralph Clarke, of Cutthorp in the co. of Derby, Esquire. She died without issue, and he married a second wife, Barbara Westby, by whom he had two sons, Oliver Ben-oni-jamin and Thomas. In 1691, Oliver, \"now of Sheriff Hales, in the co. of Salop.\" married Mary, the daughter of John Wood house, of the same place. The issue of this marriage were John, William, Benjamin, and Sarah. The eldest son John, of Gainsborough, merchant, by his will, dated in 1733, devises 1,200/. to his wife Elizabeth in full satisfaction of her marriage settlement, and to his brotber William, in fee, all his real property, and constitutes him executor and residuary legatee. He died shortly afterwards without children. Benjamin died unmarried, and neither Sarah, who married a Mr. Dakcyne, nor William himself, at the time when the sale was in contemplation, had any family ; and, in point of fact, if any such had been in existence, they could not have barred the conveyance. By the will of Oliver Ben-oni-jamin Cromwell, then of Burton-upon-thc-Woulds, in the co. of Leicester (made May 8, 1708), father of the vendor William, Whitehouse farm was amongst other lands devised to trustees and their heirs to be sold, and the proceeds arising therefrom to be applied in liquidation of the testator's debts and funeral expenses. The residue was to be invested for the equal benefit of his two younger sons and daughter, as they should attain the ao-e of twenty-one years, an additional 50/. being bequeathed to the latter. On the ground, however, that as the Whitehouse farm was intermixed with the rest of the property of the Cromwells in Torworth, and had been \" lately well repaired,\" its sale would be p2"], [126, "108 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. attended with more disadvantage and inconvenience than that of another farm named Torworth Grange, \" joining on Barnby Moor, and much out of repair and order,\" the trustees sold the latter farm to Joseph Banks, of Scofton, in the county of Nottingham, gentleman, for 270/. in 1710, having been let for the six previous years by 0. Cromwell for only 12/. per annum, or at the rate of 2s. per acre. The Whitehouse farm was conveyed to Mr. Banks as a collateral security until the eldest son and heir of Oliver should, by proper assurances, convey Torworth Grange when he came of age. This being done, Mr. Banks made a re-conveyance of Whitehouse farm to the trustees; and in order to fortify the title to this portion of the estates which William Cromwell sold to Lord Galway, the heir-at-law of the surviving trustee, as well as Mr. Dakeyne (his wife being dead), joined in the title. Torwtorth Grange Is now therefore the property of Mr. Banks, the purchase effected by Viscount Galway in 1753 being such as I have described it above. The Grange did not remain long in Mr. Banks' hands. In 1718 he, then residing at Revesby, in Lincolnshire, sold the property, consisting of 110 acres, to Major-General Richard Sutton, of Scofton, with whose name that of his brother Sir Robert Sutton, K.B., Ambassador at the Ottoman Porte, was joined. The General, in 1734, mortgaged his estates at Boothby, Caysthorpe, Barrowby, and Denton, in the county of Lincoln, as well as his Notts estates at Barnby Moor, which he had purchased from his brother Sir Robert; Torworth Grange; Rayton (which he had bought of Edward Lord Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, and the lady Margaret, his wife); and Kilton, which he had bought of Mr. Banks. And, finally, in 1740, Robert Sutton, of Scofton, Esquire, eldest son of the General, sold Torworth Grange to John Lord Galway, and John Duke of Rutland, for 735/., being more than double the sum which his father had given for it in 1718. In 1791 Robert Arundell, Lord Galway, purchased of the Rev. George Booth of East Retford a messuage, together with about thirty-four acres of land, in this township. The greater portion of this purchase was in the open fields of Torworth, and consisted of \"lands on a furlong\" as they then were, and still (where they exist) are, designated. No further enlargement of the Monckton property in Torworth of any material importance has since taken place. It remains to this day in the possession of the direct descendant of John Monckton, the original purchaser, constituting the greater portion of the entire township : and by the intelligence and enterprise of the tenants, the general comfort of the labouring population, and the sound and healthy condition of the village, attests the beneficial results which flow from the fostering and directing influence of a landlord who is always at hand and ready to encourage in difficulty and to relieve in distress. And now after these necessary, but I fear somewhat dry, details, let me endeavour to refresh and re-invigorate the attention of my readers by a few personal and historical facts connected with the men whom we have had before us, the Cromwells, Bankses, and Suttons, and then by a more detailed account of the noble house of Monckton."], [127, "109 FAMILIES OF CROMWELL. BANKS, AND SUTTON. Families of Cromwell, Banks, and Sutton. The Cromwells possessed considerable property at Barnby Moor, Sutton-cum-Lound, Torworth, Ranskill, Scrooby, and Bawtry. Their names occur in the Sutton registers more than three centuries ago. I give extracts. 1538, Johan. Cromwell, of Sutton, daughter to Henry Cromwell, was baptized the 21st December. 1541, William, son of the same, was baptized 28th July. In the same year Alyce Cromwell, of Sutton, daughter of Thomas Cromwell, was baptized 20th February. In the same registers occurs the burial of Thomas Cromwell in 1612. The Blyth registers record two marriages of Cromwell with Stanfield of Torworth, and the interment of Nicholas Cromwell, of Blyth, in 1628. He had married Elizabeth Hastings in 1624, by whom he had a daughter Constance, born in 1628, who married John Boone in 1651. There is also the burial here of Thomas Cromwell, December 28, 1629. John Cromwell, of Clayworth, clerk, of whom mention has been made, was one of the Non conformist clergy who were ejected by the Act of Uniformity in 1662. He then lost Clayworth. He was born at Barnby Moor, and his baptism is entered as follows in the register of my church. \"John, sone of Rob. Cromwell dc Barmbie, bapt. Sept. 20, 1631.\" He was of Magdalen College, Cambridge ; and settled early in life as a minister at iioyston, which place he left with regret, having been solicited by his relations to return into Nottinghamshire, and take the living of Clayworth, then vacant by the death of Dean Topham. He received a presentation to it from the Protector, not on any ground of relationship, but simply of his name, and, resigning his fellowship, removed to his benefice in 1657. The Protector wished him to take some office about his household, but this Mr. Cromwell declined. lie belonged to the Congregational or Indi pendent body, and was a popular preacher. At the restoration his right to Clayworth was disputed, but he appears to have retained possession till the Act of Uniformity displaced him. In consequence of a suspicion of his being concerned in plots against the Government in the early years of Charles Il.hewas imprisoned with others at Newark for some years. Here he became ill; the Duke of Newcastle interceded for him with the council, and he was liberated. He then lived for a time in Notts, but at length accepted an invitation to become pastor of a Nonconformist congregation at Norwich. He resided in that city about ten years, subject to many inconveniences; fell ill, as the consequence of a harassed life; left Norwich in infirm health for his own native air, but never recovered. He died in 1684, and was buried at Sutton April 23. This is the substance of the information which Calamy gives us respecting John Cromwell in his \" Lives of the Ejected Ministers.\" In Dr. Calamy's Continuation of his history, we are further told that he was a comely person, of a healthful constitution, very studious and serious at college ; that he took his degree of B.A. in 1652, and in the interval between his graduating and being presented to Clayworth occupied himself in preaching at various country places around Cambridge. The Protector wished to make him chaplain to his son Henry Cromwell, with a salary of 200/ a-year, which he declined. He preached in Cromwell's household, and by some was considered the most powerful preacher there. He was ordained at Clayworth after the Congregational fashion by his uncle Fisher, vicar of Sheffield, and other ministers. He died at Barnby Moor, the place of his birth, where he had a competent estate. The rectory of Clayworth was valued in his time at 180/. a-year. Several of his sermons were printed in 1685. The reader may be further interested in knowing that, in June, 1658, he married at Brampton,"], [128, "110 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. near Chesterfield, Mary Clarke, of Cutthorpe, as I have already stated. His second wife was Barbara Westby, daughter of Thomas Westby, of Ravenfield, Esq. by which marriage he became connected with nearly all the more eminent Puritan families in the south of Yorkshire. He made his will 30th June, 1680, wherein he described himself as \" John Cromwell, of Norwich, gent.\" and constituted his wife Barbara and his three children, Oliver Ben-oni-jamin, Eulalia Sarah, and Thomas, his executors, and his uncle John Hatfield, of Hatfield, his brothers George Westby, of Ranfield, and John Hatfield, of Laughton, together with Cuthbert Brown, of Hansworth, as supervisors. He left his estates in Notts and Yorkshire to his son Oliver, who settled, for a time at least, at Barnby Moor. His wife was the daughter of another ejected minister, John Woodhouse, of Sheriff Hales. His son William was christened at Blyth 3rd January, 1698; Benjamin, 10th March, 1702. William, the vendor of the Torworth property of the family to the second Viscount Galway, was of Leicester, and died 24th July, 1766. He appears to have married a daughter of \u2014 Clay, a solicitor at Leicester. Benjamin was a surgeon at Nottingham, and died unmarried. Sarah (the daughter of Oliver) married Mr. Dakeyne, a solicitor at Mansfield. The widow of Oliver married Samuel Cromwell, M.D. of Mansfield, a widower. Dr. Crom well made his will 17th August, 1728. He speaks of a son Ralph. His wife died in 1734. A mural tablet in the chancel of Sutton church commemorates the names of Samuel, John, and Robert Cromwell of that place, brothers, who died, the first, 18th March, 1785, aged eighty; the second, 7th February, 1789, aged eighty-six; and the third, 1st March, 1800, aged ninety three, and were buried there. Robert is remembered by persons in Sutton still living, and is described as being in an independent position, and of venerable and gentleman-like appearance. We have had under review two men, Bishop Saunderson and John Cromwell, both of them most intimately connected with our parish, the first having spent his youthful days under his father's roof at Blyth Abbey, the second having been born and having ended his days at Barnby Moor. They were men of opposite bias, and took perfectly opposite directions through life, the first adhering most devotedly to the Church and monarchy of England, in adverse as in prosperous days, the second seceding from the one, and probably disliking the other. Saunderson was ejected from his living by the fiat of dominant revolution, Cromwell from his benefice by the law of restored monarchy ; and that benefice, singularly enough, one which had been previously held by Dean Topham, whose daughter had married Saunderson's grand-nephew. I admire ex imo corde the principles and character of the first. I have no sympathy with the opinions of the second. Both the one and the other, however, let us bear in mind, gave the strongest evidences of the sincerity of their convictions, and therefore if, as is most true, we owe a debt of deep gratitude to the one, let us forbear from pronouncing a harsh judgment upon the memory of the other. Joseph Banks, of Scofton, who purchased Torworth Grange of the trustees of Oliver Cromwell in 1710, afterwards resided at Revesby Abbey, in Lincolnshire. He represented first Grimsby, and afterwards Totnes in Parliament, and died 27th September, 1727. From him descended lineally Sir Joseph Banks, who held the distinguished office of President of the Royal Society for a lon\u00bber period than any other man \u2014 Sir Isaac Newton coming nearest to him in duration of office \u2014 and who, by the scientific distinction which he attained, and by the munificent encouragement which he afforded during a long life to every branch of science and art, has left a great and an honoured name and character behind him. With respect to the Suttons, the Brigadier Richard and Sir Robert, I would briefly observe"], [129, "111 THE FAMILY OF MONCKTON. that they were lineally descended from Sir William Sutton, Knight, of Averham, whose eldest son Robert was created Lord Lexington by Charles I. for his devotion to the royal cause; that they were sons of Robert Sutton, of Kelham, Notts; that the elder of the two, Robert, was baptised at Kelham 23rd September, 1671, was a diplomatist of high rank, privy councillor, ambassador in Holland, Constantinople, and Paris, and represented Notts and afterwards Great Grimsby. He married in 1725 Judith, daughter and co-heir of Benjamin Tichbourne, Esq. and widow of Charles third Earl of Sunderland, by whom he had two sons: John, who purchased Norwood, near Southwell, and Richard, who succeeded his brother, who died without issue, and was Under Secretary of State from 1766 to 1772, and created a Baronet 25th September, 1772.

He was buried at Averham 30th July, 1737, and was succeeded by his eldest son Robert, whose grandson Robert William Evelyn Sutton, of Scofton, Esq. and afterwards of West Retford, sold Scofton to the Foljambcs.

From him sprang Robert Monckton, who succeeded to the lordship of Cavil, in the parish of Eastrington, near Howdcn, by marriage with Eleanor, great-great-granddaughter of Sir John Cavil, of Cavil, Knight, and daughter and co-heir of William Mostyn, Esq., of Hunscot, in the county of Warwick. From Robert Monckton lineally descended Marmaduke Monckton, Esq., of Cavil,* and from this point it will be necessary to draw out the Pedigree of the house at full length. I therefore append it: * There are some good portraits at Serlby, including one by Sir Peter Lely of Sir Philip Monckton, the grandfather of the first Viscount Galway ; one of Robert Monckton the father of the first Viscount ; one of Theo dosia Fountayne, the wife of Robert Monckton; one of the first Viscount; as also those of Lady Elizabeth Manners, his first wife, and of Lady Frances Manners, her sister. A considerable portion of the present hall at Hodroyd appears to have been erected in the early part of the reign of Elizabeth. The whole is of stone, and takes the form of the letter H. The several windows have stone mullions and transoms, and the lights are narrow, not more than 14 inches wide, and are glazed in lead. Moulded string courses continue round the buildini* above the lower and upper windows : the gables are coped with moulded and weathered coping, and the apices and knees of the gables have carved stone terminations. On the east front there is a panel over the garden entrance, contain ing the family arms in bold relief."], [130, "112 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH.

I shall now append a few additional historical notices of the Monckton family, connecting them by numerals with the persons to whom they refer in the pedigree : 1. Sir Francis Monckton, father of Sir Philip, furnished Charles the First with large supplies of money whilst he was at York. 2. Sir Philip, then very young, was in the regiment of Sir T. Metham when the King attacked Hull. He was in the Yorkshire army, which the Earl of Newcastle led against the Scots, and on account of his gallant conduct at Corbridge, in Northumberland, was knighted. He was in the fatal engagement at Marston Moor; and in the equally disastrous one of Naseby he lost three horses; and was wounded at Rowton Heath, where he commanded Sir Marmaduke Lani: dale's brigade. In 1648. when the Duke of Hamilton revived the hopes of the Royalists, Sir Philip was charged with the care of the King's interests in Yorkshire. He afterwards fought a desperate battle with Colonel Rossiter at Willoughby, where his little force was nearly totally destroyed, and he himself taken prisoner. Sir Philip conceived that it was through the interposition of Sir Thomas Fairfax that his life was spared. He was imprisoned at Belvoir Castle; but finally, in December, 1648, was permitted to leave the island. Here is one of his confiding and affectionate letters to his mother, written during this his exile from his country \u2014 \" Bruxelles, Nov. 19, 1649. \" Deare Mother, \u2014 I wish that I had anie thing moore worthy of your acceptance than the picture, which I could almost wish that I had not sent it, if you suffer the sight of it to cause any sadnesse in you. I thanke God I live here very quiett and contented untill it please God to sende Q"], [132, "114 HISTORY OMP THE PARISH OF BLYTH. us a happy meeteing, which I do not doubt of in His good time, with joy and comfort. As you have allwaies instructed me to make it my chiefe care to serve God, soe I hope I shall have grace to worship Him and obey you, whose loveinge kindnesse to me has beene moore than motherly, which does oblige me to beseche you not to be troubled at the thinges of this world, for the love you beare him that dailye praies for your happinesse, and will ever remaine, \" Yor most dutiful sonne, \" Ph. Monckton.\" Towards the close of 1651 he was in England again, and took so earnest and active a part in the measures which were concerted for the restoration of Charles II., that the King wrote to him, acknowledging his services and promising to reward him. About 1655 he was arrested for having plotted an insurrection in London, and brought before the Protector, who repeated to him the heads of a conversation which he had held Avith one whom he had considered equally zealous with himself in the promotion of the King's return. From this time he was kept a close prisoner, and he conceived that the death of Cromwell alone saved him from being sent to Jamaica. On being released he retired to York. On the 1st January, 1659, when Lilburn had posses sion of this city with a strong garrison, and Fairfax was at the gates, Sir Philip caused a diversion by heading a band of citizens, and thereby materially facilitated the entrance of Fairfax. It ap pears in fact that the county of York was so warmly disposed towards the exiled King, that General Monck and Lord Fairfax, who had become identified in principles, and had for some time main tained a secret correspondence, entertained strong doubts whether they should not proclaim him in the city. \" After the Restoration (I quote the Avords of Mr. Hunter, South Yorkshire, ii. 418), he re ceived commissions from the King, and made himself active in all times of public disturbance. If there was a rumour of a plot, Sir Philip was the first to gather and communicate information ; and, as plots in those days were often any thing but dangerous to the government, his sagacity and zeal were not always so acceptable as he hoped at the council table. Here I believe was the ground of the bad understanding which appears to have subsisted between him and the Earl of Clarendon, aa'Iio never condescends to mention liim in his ' History of the Rebellion,' to whose fall Sir Philip imagined that he contributed. In the year of his shrievalty of Yorkshire he undertook to deal AAdth a person who Avas the object of popular indignation, the clerk of the peace, who was charged with great extortion in his office. He made great exertions to bring to light the delinquencies of this person, and collected a great body of evidence. The affair brought upon him great trouble, expense, and vexation. In his private affairs he had endless suits and solicitations His eventful, hurried, and anxious life closed in 1678 or 1679, and he was interred in the church of South Newbold, where some warlike trophies, which hung over his grave, were lately to be seen.\" 3.

Robert Monckton retired to Holland in the time of James II. He returned Avith William, and received from him the commission of Captain in the regiment of foot commanded by Lord Mordaunt. He was in the reign of William a commissioner of trade and plantations, and represented Pontefract and Aldborough in several parliaments. 5. John Monckton first Viscount Galway was in 1734 made one of the commissioners of the revenue in Ireland, and took his scat in the Upper House there 4 Oct. 1727. 6. William, second Viscount, made in 1748 receiver-general of his Majesty's crown and fee farm rents in the counties of York, Westmerland, Durham, &c. His aunt, Lady Frances Manners, married Richard Arundell (the son of John Lord Arundell by the widow of Sir Richard Mauleverer, of Allerton Mauleverer, near Knaresborough, to Avhich widow had been bequeathed the property by her son Richard Mauleverer, who died unmarried,) Avho, dying in 1758 without children, left his estates to his wife Lady Frances. She died in 1769, and bequeathed Allerton Mauleverer to her nephew William Viscount Galway, who in consequence took the name of Arundell. 7. Robert Monckton Arundell, fourth Viscount, sold Allerton Mauleverer in 1786 to the Duke of York, who resided there for some time in 1787 and 1789 with his brother the Prince of Wales.

Pass we on to a manor Avhich since Norman times has acknowledged as its lords, and paid suit and service to, a long line of mitred prelates, from Thomas to the haughty and ambitious Roger, the rival of Becket; the royal Plantagenet; the virtuous Melton; the munificent Thoresby; the noble-hearted Scrope ; the great Wolsey ; and Archbishops of York in succession down to our oAvn age. The very name carries us back to remote ages. It bears upon it the impress of foreign invasion and foreign dominion. Ranskill is a purely Danish word. It is Ravenskelf, the shelf or shelving-knoll of raven, and occurs as Raskelf, the name of a village and station north of York. As the eagle was in the estimation of the Romans the sacred bird of Jupiter, so among the Northmen the raven Avas consecrated to Odin, their tutelary deity, one of whose names in conse quence was raven-god. They made auspices from the flight and scream of this bird, and considered it a good omen if it folloAved them to battle. During the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries the raven was the great flag under which the Northmen rallied and fought. It Avaved over Canute at Ashingdon, and over the Conqueror at Hastings; but after the last of these battles it gradually paled, and at length sank beneath the sacred symbol of our holy religion the Cross. As I am about to treat of a very ancient manor of the Archbishops of York, in whose diocese Nottinghamshire, till within the last few years, was situated; and as through their ancient posses sions and privileges, and frequent residence in this district, they became very intimately connected with it, it will not, I trust, be deemed altogether irrelevant to the subject to furnish my readers with a brief and compendious account of the establishment of Christianity in that ancient diocese subsequently to the days of St. Augustine. Ancient Diocese of York. After incurring imminent peril of assassination at the Court of Redwald, king of East Anglia, whither he had fled for refuge from Edilfrid, king of Bernicia, and after having escaped from a A'iolent death in a manner which, in the narrative of Venerable Bede, is not altogether free from admixture of marvellous incident, Edwin the son of Ella, founder of the kino-dom of ' Cj Deira, ascended (a.md. 626) the throne of Northumbria, which comprised the united kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, and extended from the Plumber to the friths of Forth and Clyde. When firmly seated in his dominions he married Ethelberga, daughter of Ethelbert king of Kent, the first English sovereign Avho embraced the Christian religion at the hands of Augustine in 597, and herself a Christian lady, who took with her to her new home Paulinus, an associate of the Roman missionary. Edwin himself was a pagan ; but circumstances providentially conspired to work his conversion. On Easter Day, a.d. 626, he very narrowly escaped assassination by the hand of an emissary of Cynegils king of Wessex."], [135, "117 AMKCIEMNT DIOCESE OF YORK. The same evening the queen was delivered of a daughter, who with eleven others was bap tized on the eve of the following Whitsunday, the king promising that he himself would also embrace the Christian faith if he should prove victorious in the expedition on which he was on the point of setting out in order to take vengeance upon the treacherous king of Wessex. He did so, and after a year's anxious deliberation he entered the great council of his kingdom, accompanied by Paulinus, informed them of his partiality towards Christianity, and solicited their advice. The graphic account given by Beda of what followed is well knoAvn. Coifi, the pagan high priest of Northumbria, after hearing from the mouth of Paulinus the great doctrines of the Christian religion, hurled his spear into the nearest heathen temple, which was immediately burned to the ground;* and Edwin, his great nobles, and many of his subjects, were solemnly baptized at York on Easter day, in a small church of wood dedicated to St. Peter, the first precursor of that most august of temples, the noble minster, a.d. 627. Paulinus was established in the archiepiscopal see of York, and for six years his labours in the conversion of the heathen were unremitted. In one day he is said to have baptized ten thousand in the river Swale. He moved about from place to place with the court, and his abodes at Yeverin in Glendale, Northumberland, and at Catterick, were long held in extreme veneration by people, AAdiosc fathers, they gratefully remembered, had there been taught the blessings of true religion. Edwin's king dom at this time reached into the counties of Nottingham and Lincoln, and Paulinus crossed the Humber to preach and baptize at Lincoln. He also made converts at Southwell; and Bede tells us that in his time, about 100 years afterwards, traditional memorials were preserved of the personal appearance of this first and eminent missionary of the North \u2014 of his tall stature, his thin and hooked nose, lean face and black hair, and countenance terrible enough, but A'ery reverend. But \" a new and unforeseen accident,\" remarks Drake, in his History of York, with much truth and quaintness, \" spoiled all his harvest, and made the painful husbandman to seek shelter in another country.\" King Edwin was slain 12 Oct. 633, at Hatfield, in Yorkshire, as he fought against Penda king of Mercia, the most cruel and poAverful of all the pagan sovereigns of England, and C\u00e6dwalla king of the Britons. Queen Ethelberga, her children, and Archbishop Paulinus, fled for refuge into Kent, and the converts of Northumbria relapsed into idolatry. On the death of Edwin, Bernicia and Deira again had each their king, who were pagans. But Oswald, the brother and successor of Eanfrid on the throne of Bernicia, determined to re-establish the independence of his country and the religion of Christ. His brother had been treacherously slain in a parley with C\u00e6dwalla. But he conquered and sIcav the British king near Hexham, a.d. 635, and this decisive victory placed him on the throne of Northumberland as it existed in Edwin's time. He immediately applied to the monastery of Iona, where he had spent some portion of his previous life in exile, for a supply of Christian teachers. Corman, who Avas the first missionary sent, returned in disappointment. Aidan next undertook the mission, and by the strict austerity of his life, and the unwearied zeal with which he prosecuted his sacred task, won the affection and esteem, while his arguments convinced the reason, of Oswald's subjects. The king gave him the offer of any place which he might select for his permanent residence, and he chose the isle of Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, which was cut off twice in the day from the mainland \u2666 \" Aras quas ipse sacraverat succendit cunctis videntibus\" is the classical description of Beda. The place where this happened was Godmundingham, i.e. idolorum domus, now called Godmundham, near Marketweighton, in the East Riding."], [136, "118 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. of Northumberland by the tide, and was within vieAv of Barnborough Castle, at that time the residence of the Northumbrian sovereigns. * Aidan was consecrated first bishop of Lindisfarne by the abbot of Iona, f and became the founder of that see, which continued to exist after him under fifteen bishops in succession, until an incursion of the Danes compelled the last bishop Eardulph and his monks to abandon the island, and in a feAv years to fix their abode at Chester-le-Street. During the Avhole of his episcopate of seventeen years Aidan exercised ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the enormous kingdom of Northumbria, which reached, as I have said, from the Humber to the Frith of Forth, and even stretched into Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire; for, as we have seen, Paulinus had fled on the murder of King Edwin in 633 to Rochester, and no new appointment to the Archbishoprick of York followed for thirty years. Aidan and his successors at Lindisfarne Avere virtually, although not nominally, Archbishops of York during that period. Paulinus entailed his pall upon the see of Rochester, and York continued bereft of that distinction for 125 years. The sanctity, the zeal, and the self-denial of the first Bishop of Lindis farne have gained for him a high place among the best and holiest of the ministers of Christ's Church of that or of any other age. His character has been thus draAvn by Bede, who was in every respect, save one, his most devoted admirer, f \" He was wont to traverse everywhere, both totvn and country, on foot, never on horseback, unless compelled by some urgent necessity; and Avherever in his way he saw any, either rich or poor, immediately turning to them, he invited them, if infidels, to embrace the mystery of the faith, or, if they were believers, he strove to strengthen them in the faith and to stir them up by words and actions to alms and good works. If it happened, which was but seldom, that he was invited to banquet with the King, he went with one or two clerks, and having taken a small repast, made haste to be gone with them either to read or to pray. I have written thus much concerning the person and works of the aforesaid individual \u2014 preserving the memory thereof for the benefit of the reader, namely, his love of peace and charity; his continence and humility; his mind superior to anger and avarice; his industry in keeping and teaching the heavenly commandments ; his diligence in reading and watching ; his authority becoming a priest, in reproving the haughty and poAverful, and at the same time his * The tide did now its flood-mark gain, And girdled in the saint's domain ; For, with the flow and ebb, its style Varies from continent to isle : Dry-shod, o'er sands, twice every day, The pilgrims to the shrine find way ; Twice every day the waves efface Of staves and sandaled feet the trace. Marmion, C. ii. ix. t The power possessed by the abbots of Iona of consecrating bishops was singular, and probably without a parallel. I \" Quod autem Pascha non suo tempore observabat, vel canonicum ejus tempus ignorans vel su\u00e6 gentis auctoritate ne agnitum sequeretur devictus, non adprobo.\" He adds these beautiful and emphatic words : \" In quo tamen hoc adprobo quia in celebratione sui Pasch\u00e6 non aliud corde tenebat, venerabatur et predicabat, quam quod nos, id est, redemptionem generis humani per passionem, resurrectionem, ascensionem in c\u0153los, Mediatoris Dei et hominum, hominis Iesu Christi.\" Eccl.

To say all in a feAv Avords, as near as I could be informed by those who knew him, he took care to omit none of all those things which he found enjoined in the apostolical or prophetical writings, but to the utmost of his power endeavoured to perform them all in his actions.\" The nature and limits of my work permit me only very briefly to state that Aidan was followed by fifteen bishops in succession at Lindisfarne, among whom was Cuthbert, the great patron saint of Durham. The last Bishop, Eardulph, and his monks were driven away from the island by an incursion of the Danes a.d. 868. They carried with them the bones of their patron saint, St. Cuthbert, and after wandering about from place to place for seven long years at last settled at Crake, near York. Alfred the Great had succeeded to the throne of England, and from motives of policy had made as his tributary king in the North, Guthred, a Dane, Avho gave Eardulph and his monks a home and a cathedral at Chester-le- Street, which became the seat of episcopacy for 113 years, when the ecclesiastics were again dislodged by the Danes. They took shelter with the bones of St. Cuthbert at Ripon, until the storm had passed away. On their return it was the will of Cuthbert to rest at Durham, and here sprang up in due time \" his cathedral huge and vast.\" In 1082, or very shortly afterwards, the monks of Durham established a colony of their body at Lindisfarne, and the ruins of their monastic church remain to this day. But. although the cathedral of the bishop was thus succeeded by the convent of the monk, the name and memory of the former still survive, and to this day the islanders love to call the ruin by the name of \" the Cathedral.\" I must return from the pleasing and deeply interesting topic of this the first and earliest establishment of episcopacy in the northern portion of ancient Northumbria, on which I fear I have dwelt too long, to York, which the departure of Paulinus in 633 left, as my reader will bear in mind, without a bishop : and to the division of this great diocese, which was co-extensive with Northumbria, into four, viz. York, Ilexham, Lindisfarne, and Whitherne in Galloway. After the departure of Paulinus, the continued wars of the North and Pagan persecution deprived York of episcopal superintendence for thirty years. At length Alcfrid, heir apparent of the kingdom, sent Wilfrid of Ripon into France for consecration, with a view to remove the see from Lindisfarne to York. Wilfrid, once consecrated, made no haste to return, and the king Oswi conferred the vacant see of York upon Ceadda abbot of Lastingham, a.d. 666, who after three years was driven from his post by Wilfrid, and eventually became bishop of Lichfield. Wilfrid took up his abode at York, and for several years presided over the whole diocese of Northumbria. But, in consequence of a quarrel between himself and Egfrid king of Northumberland, he Avas compelled to resign his see: and on his departure the diocese was formally divided into two portions, with the Tees then, as now, the boundary. Bosa was, a.d. 678, made bishop of the southern portion, Deira; Eata, bishop of the northern, Bernicia. Three years afterwards, viz. a.d. 681, Theodore archbishop of Canterbury erected the two additional Dioceses of Hexham and Whitherne in Galloway, appointing Tunberct bishop of the first, and Trumvin bishop of the second, with charge of that portion of the diocese of Lindis farne which lay beyond the TAveed. \" This augmentation (says Lingard, speaking of this and other changes,) Avas not, however, sufficient to satisfy the spiritual Avants of the people ; and the Venerable Bede laments that, in the"], [138, "120 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. great and populous diocese of York, there Avere many districts which had never been visited by their bishop, and thousands of Christians whose souls had not received the holy spirit by the imposition of his hands. To remove so alarming an evil, this enlightened monk earnestly proposed that the original plan of Gregory the Great should be completed ; that the church of Northumbria should be intrusted to the separate administration of twelve Prelates; and that the neAv episcopal sees should be fixed in some of the rich but nominal monasteries Avhich covered and impoverished that kingdom. But not only did his advice remain unheeded, eA'en one of the four northern bishoprics, that of Hexham, was suffered to become extinct before the end of the century.\" Verily, Gregory and Bede were church reformers in the truest and best sense of the term : and no wonder ; for they were men of exalted intellect, enlarged philanthropy, and fervent piety, com pared with whom the Church-tinkers of modern days sink into insignificance. Had the spirit of their advice been adopted with reference to the ecclesiastical administration of England at large, it may with safety be affirmed that the Church would have been the channel of blessings ten thousand-fold greater than those which she has been permitted to convey. One great impedi ment in the way of an increase of the episcopate in modern days appears to have been an appre hension on the part of our spiritual rulers, that if the bishops were multiplied, there would be in the present state of national feeling no possibility of obtaining seats for them in the Upper House, Avhilst on the other hand a bishop without a seat in the Legislature would be a novel and a perilous innoA-ation. Hence it Avas, that when a few years ago the additional sees of Manchester and Ripon were constituted, the balance was designed to be preserved by the union of Bristol with Gloucester, and of St. Asaph with Bangor. This measure Avas in part only carried out. Bristol was united with Gloucester, and not St. Asaph with Bangor ; but, Manchester and Ripon having both been erected into episcopal sees, the Legislature enacted that, by way of maintaining the episcopal seats in the House of Lords at their ancient number only, the junior Bishop for the time being (with certain exceptions) should not possess a seat. The precedent, therefore, of a Bishop without a seat in the Legislature has been clearly established, and it remains to be seen to what extent the country will carry it. Most assuredly modern legislation on ecclesiastical matters has not been conceived in that larn*e and comprehensive and far-sighted spirit Avhich can alone secure the confidence of true Churchmen, and most effectually promote the welfare and usefulness of the Church itself. To go no further than Nottinghamshire for proof of Avhat I assert, the chapter of Southwell has been destroyed and its patronage given prospectively to the Bishops of Manchester and Ripon, who have no connection whatever with the county. But, if ever the day should come when this county shall possess a Bishop of its OAvn at Southwell, the chapter, together with its patronage, must of necessity be restored. Ancient Episcopal Franchises. . The same reasons which have induced me to give the above summary account of the ancient diocese of York prompt me to submit to my readers a brief explanation of the nature of ancient episcopal franchises, with their accompanying powers and privileges. The grants made to our ancient Saxon Bishops Avere enormous. Guthred, the tributary King of Northumbria under Alfred the Great, gave to God and St. Cuthbert all the country between the"], [139, "121 ANCIENT EPISCOPAL FRANCHISES. Tyne and Weare; and the same prince and Alfred subsequently extended the patrimony of the northern diocese of Bernicia from the Tyne to the Tees. Among the charters of confirmation of these SAveeping grants was one of King Edmund to this effect: \" In which lands let St. Cuthbert and his Bishop possess all the privileges and franchises which appertain to the Crown, with all their appurtenances, free for ever and discharged from every service.\" The consequence was, that from very early times, and doAvn even to my own recollection, the county of Durham was called by the dwellers on the southern bank of the Tees \" Bishoprick\" \u2014 the Bishop's kingdom. Still more ancient was the territory appropriated in all probability by Oswald king of Northumbria to the see of Lindisfarne, a.d. 635, the boundaries of Avhich are thus defined by Leland. \" The possessions of the Church of Lindisfarne extend on the east from the Tweed to Warnmouth ; they then ascend the Warn to its source near the hill of Hebburne, and from thence by an imaginary track they proceed to the Bremish, which becomes the line of demarcation until it unites its streams with the Till.\" Beyond the Tweed everything between the Eder and the Leder seems to have belonged to the Saint, in addition to an extensive territory attached to the monastery of Tiningham, stretching from Lammermoor to Eymouth. The territorial grants to the southern diocese of Deira or York were also very large. Thus Athelstan bestowed upon it Bishop Wilton; Amounderncss, in Lancashire; Shireburn; Beverley; Ripon. In 958 King Oswy gave to Archbishop Oschitel Southwell, with which very probably the ancient manors of Laneham, Avhcre was an aula, and Sutton, Avith their dependencies, consti tuting North Soke, were united, inasmuch as the franchise of the archbishops in this county is generally designated the Liberty of Southwell and Scrooby. In fact, Avhen the Domesday account was draAvn up, I find the Archbishop of York possessing lands and privileges in no less than about 180 different places in Yorkshire, and in nearly 50 places in our OAvn county of Nottingham, the great manors of North Notts being those of Laneham and Sutton. Not only, however, were the possessions of our ancient sees very extensive, but the powers and privileges appertaining thereto, very great. We have already seen that the franchises of the bishops of Bernicia north of the Tees were in every sense of the Avord kingly. And it is clear and incontestably established, that, in ancient times immediately succeeding the Conquest, the prelates of Durham appointed their own sheriffs, constables, and justices of assize and gaol delivery; their eschaetors, coroners, foresters, and bailiffs. They held their Inquisitions post Mortem, their court of Avards and liveries, enjoyed the power of levying taxes and subsidies, of array both of ships and soldiers, and of coining \u2014 in fact exercised supreme jurisdiction, both civil and military, from the Tees to the Tyne, and in considerable districts of the county of Northumberland. It may have been that these northern portions of the island were remote from the seat of the executive government, and bordered upon the neighbouring and rival kingdom of Scotland ; that that executive was weak, and could neither effectually nor promptly reach the distant depen dencies of the Crown, and that, in consequence, our early Sovereigns, as a matter both of prudence and necessity, delegated a very large and co-ordinate share of their power to the northern prelate and Prince Palatine of Durham, constituting thus to all intents and purposes an imperium in imperio. Nay, not only so; but that, in times preceding the Conquest, such was the unsettled state of the Saxon kingdoms, and so precarious and feeble the powers of their sovereigns, that thev Avere glad to strengthen their government by entrusting a portion at least of their powers to those it"], [140, "122 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. who had a stake in the country and an interest in the safety of life and property. Be this as it may, there can be no doubt that in these early days the sovereigns were in the constant habit of investing ecclesiastics as well as laymen with civil powers, such for instance as appointing officers, trying civil and criminal suits and offences, receiving suit and service, and the enjoyment of various other privileges within their own franchises and over their own vassals; for the spirit of Saxon, as indeed of northern polity generally, lay not in centralization as at this day, but in diffu sion : and hence courts were multiplied, from the king's court downwards to the shire-mote, the hundred-mote, and the hall or manor mote. I have entered into these details, in order that those of my readers who are less conversant in such matters may be enabled to obtain clearer and more accurate conceptions of that connec tion which for nearly eight hundred years has existed between the archbishops of York and tne township of Ranskill. Ancient Condition of the Township. \u2014 Proprietors. We now come to Domesday Survey. From that ancient document we learn thus much of the possessions of the archbishops of York in the northern part of the county of Nottingham. In \" Sudton (Sutton), evidently the chief manor, the palace at Scrooby not having then been erected, and the berewicks or hamlets of Scrobi, Madressei, Mattersea, and Lund, Lound, Avas one carucate of land and six bovates to be taxed : Land six carucates. Archbishop Thomas now has there two carucatesin demesne, fourteen villeins, and six board-men with six carucates. There are seven acres of meadow. Pasturable wood half a leuka and eight quarantens long, and eight quarantens and a half broad, value in King Edward's time 8/. ; the same now. Soke of this Manor. \u2014 In Ettone (Eaton) two carucates to be taxed. In Tilne two bovates and the fourth part of one bovate. In Wellon, Welham, and Simenton, five bovates and the fourth part of one bovate. In Grenelei, Gringley, one bovate and the fourth part of one bovate. In Scafteorde, Scaftworth, one carucate. In Euretone, Everton, one carucate and a third part of one bovate. This land consists of twelve carucates. There are thirty-eight sochmen with eighteen villeins and twenty board-men, with twenty-five carucates. In Tilne, one mill belonging to Lane ham yields thirty shillings. In Redforde one mill belonging to Sutton. In Claueburch, Clar borough, six bovates and a half. Meadow four quarantens and a half long, and as much broad, and forty-five acres besides. Pasturable wood two miles and a half long and tAvo miles broad.\" After noticing one or two intermediate manors the Survey then advances to Ranskill. The original runs thus: \" In Raveschel iiij bou 7 dim ad gld. Tra e j car. Vasta suit 7 e. Godric tenuit. Arch tenet.\" That is, in Ranskill four bovates and a half to be taxed. The land consists of one carucate. It Avas and is waste. Godric held it. The archbishop holds it. By referring to the observations which I have already made in the Introduction, the Reader will be enabled to form a pretty accurate conception of the condition and aspect of this district generally, and of Ranskill as a portion thereof, in the time of the Conqueror. Assuming that the township was in extent then what it is now, we learn that Ranskill possessed only about seventy acres of land worth taxing to the public tax of the kingdom, and that the township was waste and belonged to the archbishop of York. Whether considered in a phy sical, a moral, or an intellectual point of view, the condition of such a township must have been"], [141, "123 ANCIENT CONDITION OF THE TOWNSHIP. abject in the extreme. A few half-clothed, half-fed peasants congregated together in miserable hovels, hardly elevated above the brute beasts around them, and looking out from morning to evening upon a wide and dreary expanse of uninclosed waste. Such is the picture which Ranskill presents in ancient times. But the proximity of a Christian prelate, from the time at least Avhen he began to include Scrooby among his manorial residences, Avould soon tend to ameliorate the condition of his serfs at Ranskill. He Avould soon begin to cultivate a portion of his fief there by the hands of his villeins for his own use; small portions he Avould let out to them in the shape of meadow and pasture or arable land, and, in proportion as they became fitted for greater tenures, these small portions would be enlarged into farms. In process of time, doubtless, he would grant thriving men and families leases for terms of years, and thus gradually the villein of earlier days Avould rise to the station of a freeholder; while in other cases various suits and services, surrenders and fines, would continue to be exacted by him as lord paramount from other occupants, who would come under the modern designation of copyholders. There has not been here, as at Torworth, any gradual and progressive concentration of property; and in consequence we have not here as there the advantage of a compact body of documentary evidence in the shape of title-deeds. The earliest existing roll of the freehold and copyhold courts of the archbishops of York for Scrooby and Ranskill is dated in 1621. From 1658 to 1773 I find among those avIio came before the court, either in the capacity of freeholders or copyholders, the following: John CromAvell, Thomas Fitzwilliam, George Goody, George Morton, Roger Nettleship, Francis Sandys, Jonathan Acklom, John Barker, William Curtis, William Denman, Viscount Galway, William Mills, Hammond Matthews, Tabothy Torr, and others. These names, Avith not more than one exception, have disappeared. In fact, the lands of Ranskill appear to have been at all times much subdivided and to have been perpetually changing hands. When the Act for inclosing the open arable and pasture land of Ranskill was passed, viz. in 1802, Viscount Galway, Rev. George Booth, Anthony Barker, Esq. and Mr. William Crofts, are enumerated among the chief owners of property there. The names of Booth and Barker have since disappeared as proprietors. Again, Avhen the tithes of the township were commuted in 1839, I find among other proprietors Lord Feversham, Dempster Hemming, Esq., W. Matthews, Richard Millns Welch. No such names occur now. The lands have passed into the hands of Viscount Galway, the heirs of Richard Wilson, John Hurbidge, and others, who, with the heirs of Messrs. John Crofts, late of Ranskill, and Thomas Crofts, late of Mantles, are now the chief proprietors in the tOAvnship. There is one portion of the township \u2014 that, namely, which is commonly known by the designation of Bishop Field \u2014 concerning which I will speak very briefly. In 1827, Mr. James Owen purchased certain hereditaments in the parish of Scrooby. In the same year he enlarged his estate by purchasing from Mr. John Crofts certain lands and great tithes in Ranskill; and about that time built the house since known by the name of Bishop Field. In 1829 Owen made an assignment to Mr. John Ellison of Stone, and Mr. George Clark of Barnby Moor, for the benefit of his creditors. In the folloAving year the assignees sold the estates in Scrooby and Ranskill to Charles Lord Feversham for 7800/. The portion of the estates which is situate in Ranskill is described as being divided into three closes, called the Bishop Field Closes, and as containing 23a. 2r., together Avith all great tithes. In 1842 William Lord Feversham, Charlotte DoAvager Lady Feversham, John Earl of Eldon, it 2"], [142, "124 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. and the Hon. Henry Legge, the two acting executors of the will of Charles Lord Feversham deceased, John Earl of Eldon, Sir Thomas Digby Legard, Bart, of Ganton, and the Hon. Henry Legge, the trustees, released and quit-claimed to the Hon. Arthur Duncombe the above estates, situated in Scrooby and Ranskill, which had been bequeathed to him by his father, Charles Lord Feversham. In or about 1856 the Hon. Arthur Duncombe sold tire property to Viscount Galway. The freehold and copyhold lands are intermixed, without any definite line of demarcation; the former greatly preponderating. Tithes. With reference to ecclesiastical property, I have to observe, that the township consists of 1265 a. 2r. 13 p. and that the vicar of Blyth is OAvner of all small tithes throughout the entire township, as well as of the great tithes of 43 A. 1 R. 7 P. being the ancient tofts and crofts. With respect to the great or rectorial tithes, however, as contrasted with the vicarial, a striking pecu liarity exists. The district, already named, of Bishop Field comprises about 305 a. the great tithes of which are in the hands, not of Trinity College, Cambridge, the rectors and patrons of the parish, but of various lay impropriators. The explanation of this anomaly I believe to be as follows. When Builli founded the monastery of Blyth, he gave the monks the church of Blyth, with all its rights and appurtenances. They enjoyed the rectorial tithes throughout their existence as a religious establishment. When they fell, the great spoliator handed over, inter alia, the rectory of Blyth to Trinity College. But long before Builli' s days\u2014 long before the Conquest \u2014 the archbishops of York had possessed the patronage of the rectory of Sutton and Scrooby ; and when, at the Conquest, the manor of Ranskill was given to them, it is probable that the tithes of that manor were claimed for this rectory, more especially as it lay contiguous to Scrooby. Indeed it is clear that such claim was made; for in the Blyth Chartulary, f. 107, is a letter commendatory from archbishop Roger, who presided over the diocese of York from 1154 to 1190, in which he states that a dispute had arisen between the convent of Blyth and the church of Sutton (cum Scrooby) respecting the parishioners (that is, as to what parish they belonged) and -tithes of Raveneskelf (Ranskill) ; and he proceeds to adjudge the controversy in favour of the convent. But from some cause or other, probably by virtue of a compromise, it would seem that the rectorial tithes of the district known by the name of Bishopfield, in the township of Ranskill, were received by the rector of Sutton cum Scrooby. Now the same archbishop founded the chapel of St. Sepulchre, on the north side of the minster of York; and, for the maintenance of the institution, consisting of four priests, four deacons, four subdeacons, and one sacrist, gave the churches of Everton, Sutton with Scrooby, Hayton, Clarborough, Retford, and others. In 1258 archbishop Sewell ordained vicarages in these churches, vesting the presentation in the sacrist. Of course at the Dissolution the revenues and patronage of St. Sepulchre's fell to the Crown. In the 4th Eliza beth they were sold to one Webster ; and thus the great tithes of Sutton and Scrooby, including Bishopfield, of Everton, Hayton, Clarborough, and Retford, together with the patronage of these churches, have passed into the hands of laymen. With regard to the vicarial tithes of Bishopfield, it is necessary to state that the vicarage of Blyth was ordained long subsequently to the controversy above adverted to, and it Avould appear that the vicar's right of tithe over this district was conceded as he enjoys it to this day."], [143, "125 COURTS OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. The lay impropriators of Bishopfield, in the township of Ranskill, (I say in the township of Ranskill, for it Avould appear that a tract of land in Scrooby is known by the same name,) at the date of the tithe commutation, were Barker, Broughton, J. Crofts, R. Cross, Hon. A. Duncombe, Cottam, Earl Spencer, Hemming, and Viscount Galway. The boundaries thereof are delineated in the maps of the Inclosure and Tithe Apportionment deeds. Courts of the Archbishop of York. I come noAv to a very interesting portion of my history, namely, to the freehold and copyhold courts of the archbishop of York, the lord of the manor of Scrooby witli Ranskill. The north soke of the Archbishop includes Laneham, Askham, Wheatley, Gringley, Welham, Clarborough, Eaton, Everton, Scaftworth, Mattersea, Tiln, Sutton, Scrooby, and Ranskill. Courts are held at Laneham, Askham, and Ranskill, to each of which jurors, freehold and copyhold, are summoned from the neighbouring members of the soke. These courts, under the presidentship of the lord's seneschal or steward, have from time imme morial effected surrenders and transfers of copyhold property, attested and enrolled wills and heirships, and taken cognisance of nuisances, encroachments, pr\u00e6dial damages, frauds, and such other matters as come before a court baron. From the time when the office of justice of the peace Avas instituted in the reign of Edward III. the Archbishop appointed his own magistrates within his oAvn liberty, who had the power of fine and imprisonment precisely like other justices of the peace. The earliest existing Court Roll, as above stated, of the court of Scrooby and Ranskill, bears date 1621. I append it at full length in English, and shall make a fevr observations by Avay of explanation at the end. \" View of Frankpledge of our Lord the King, together Avith the great court of the manor of the Most Reverend Father Tobias, by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of York, Primate of England and Metropolitan, held there the 16th October, in the year of the reign of our Lord James, by the Grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, &c. viz. of England, France, and Ireland the 19th, and of Scotland the 55th.

View of Frankpledge. Visits franci plegii. The court at which free pledgers \u2014 free bail \u2014 made their personal appearance. The principle of frank-pledge, which dates its origin from Anglo-Saxon times, lay in mutual responsibility. At first it appears to have involved no more than the obligation resting upon the inhabitants of any given district, of producing at a fixed time at their court any delinquent against the law. But, as the mere punishment of the culprit did not"], [145, "127 COURTS OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK. affect his kindred or neighbours, the next step was to compel his relations to stand security for the payment of any fine in which he was convicted, so that they became deeply interested in his good conduct and submission to the laws of the land. Still more rigorous was the next step, by Avhich every man, whether innocent or suspected, was compelled to find a bondsman, and, if he committed bodily injury and fled, his bondsman {fide jussor) was obliged to pay the penalty in his stead. \" I will,\" says king Edgar in his laws, \"that every man, whether he live within or without a town, be under bondsmen; and, if he cannot obtain them, let the town or hundred be responsible for him.\" Agreeably to which a law of the Confessor enacts, \" Isa murder be anywhere committed, let the town where the criminal abode be searched for him . . . and, if he be not discovered in a month and a day, let forty-six marks be paid by the town where the deed was committed. And, if the town or village be too poor to raise that sum, let the deficiency be supplied by the hundred in which the place is situated.'' The fact is, that, in such a state of society as that which prevailed in ancient Anglo-Saxon times, laws of a rigorous and stringent character were absolutely indispensable for the preservation of life and property. Where bands of outlaws lived by open depredation, where the people were characteristically addicted to robbery and murder, where the executive authority was feeble and remote, and where crime in general could be redeemed by a pecuniary penalty, no guarantee could be afforded by personal and individual responsibility. The onlv security Avas to make all respon sible for the crime of one. The vieAv of Frank-pledge is also known by the name of court-leet. And thus it is that at this very day the court of the archbishop of York for the manor of Scrooby with Ranskill is called \" The Court Leet and Court Baron.\" In the former, the Court Leet, the lord of the manor had the poAver of trying such offences, not capital, as were committed against life and property. In the latter, the Court Baron, he simply exercised civil jurisdiction as lord paramount over his vassals. (b.) Crown bondsmen. Capitates plegii. Capital or crown bail, responsible in the way above described for the peace of the liberty. Of course in the days of James I. the policy indicated by the name must have long fallen into desuetude. (c.) William Ray and others excused attendance. The word in the original is essoign. Essonier, exonier, essoniare, to excuse any one who did not appear at court when summoned. The chief grounds of excuse were illness, absence beyond the seas, the service of the Crown, expedition on a crusade. (d.) William Nelson and others made default of suitors of court \u2014 fecerunt desalt, sectatorum curi\u00e6 \u2014 absented themselves, though summoned, without any just excuse. (e.) George Mylner did not lay up fuel \u2014 non paravit sibi focalia. I presume for the use of the palace or court at Scrooby. (f.) The bylawmen, prepostores. The modern pinders. (G.) The above fines are imposed by the whole court assembled and doing homage. Au/ir per totum homagium. Affeurer, afforer, to tax. Afferatores, officers who in a court leet re\\ise and settle fines. Here it was done by the court. I subjoin one or two more extracts from the Court Rolls of Scrooby with Ranskill. A Lease. Nov. 4, 1623. John Griffen came in his own proper person before the court, and in full court surrendered into the hands of the lord of the manor one land (unam selionem) of arable"], [146, "128 HISTORY OF THE PARISn OF BLYTH. ground, containing by estimation one acre, lying in Ranskill Field, called Netherfall, having lands of Thomas Crumwell on the south and Edward Busk on the north, abutting towards the west on the King's high road, to the use of Thomas Gelder, his executors and assigns, from the feast of St. Martin Bishop next following the date of this court till the end of six years; to which T. Gelder, the lord of the manor, by his steward then and there granted seisin by a straw ; and he gives to the lord of the manor by way of fine for such estate and ingress one penny, and so is admitted tenant. Taking up heirship and immediate sale. \u2014 At the court held at Ranskill, November 3rd, 1721, Elizabeth Cromwell, spinster, sister of Samuel Cromwell late deceased, appears and prays to be admitted tenant of the lord of the manor of half of two messuages in Ranskill, and of all houses, barns, stables, orchards, &c. late in occupation of William Denby, and of half of all lands, meadows, closes, pastures, &c. containing by estimation forty acres, and of all other lands and tenements of Samuel Cromwell in Ranskill, which by his last will came to Elizabeth Cromwell. Whereupon the lord of the manor, by S. Lowe, Esq. his steward, granted her seisin. To the same court came Elizabeth Cromwell and surrendered all the above possessions, containing seventy acres more or less, to the use and behoof of Charles Chappell of Askham, to whom the lord of the manor, by S. Lowe, Esq. granted seisin by a straw, by virtue of letters of attorney granted to one John Williamson, Gent, by the same Charles, to have and to hold to the same Charles, &c. Twenty-four years later, viz. in 1745, Charles Chappell, probably the person above named, conveys through the court a tenement and sixteen acres of land in Ranskill to John Cromwell of Worksop, Gent, brother of Samuel Cromwell. Sir Henry Spelman observes, that the jurisdiction of courts leet was exercised in general in every baronial court, and that thus the rural population had the convenience of the administration of justice at their own homes in matters appertaining both to the crown and to the lord of the manor. The power vested in the archbishop of York of holding sessions for the trial of criminal offences by magistrates of his own nomination has been abrogated by recent act of the legislature; and the cognisance of his court over matters of a civil nature, such for instance as acts of trespass, over which the justices of the peace have no jurisdiction, appears to have fallen very much into desuetude. In both these respects I conceive that the convenience of the public has suffered. The court at the present day principally acts as a medium for admission to lands and tenements situated Avithin the limits of the manor. The Archiepiscopal Palace of Scrooby. The residences of our ancient bishops were numerous. They were in the constant habit of moving about from one part of their dioceses to another, administering various civil as well as ecclesiastical functions, dispensing hospitality, and taking with them a numerous and splendid retinue. The ancient bishops of Durham had palaces at Crake, Northallerton, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Middleham, Durham, and Norham. The archbishops of York at York, Bishopthorpe, Shireburn, Cawood, Ripon, Beverley, Otley, Southwell, and Scrooby; and as a matter of course they all had mansions in London. When Scrooby began to be a residence of the prelates of York I know not. As early as 1178"], [147, "129 THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL PALACE AT SCROOBY. John the Constable of Chester granted the town of Plumtree to Roger Archbishop of York and his successors for ever; and in 29 Henry VIII. Edward Archbishop of York demised to Geffrey Lee, Esq. his brother, all that his great close paled about called Plumtree field, besides Scrooby Park, with the lodge upon the same, together with all his warren and game of conies in the parishes of Scrooby and Harworth, &c. for forty-one years, rendering per annum lAl. 6s. 8d. Archbishop Savage at the beginning of the sixteenth century is said to have expended a large amount of money upon the palaces of CaAvood and Scrooby, which were his favourite hunting seats ; so that doubtless from ancient times the vicinity of Scrooby afforded scope for indulgence in the diversions of the chace to the prelates of York and their attendants. In 1544 Archbishop Holgate alienated to the king thirteen manors in Northumberland, forty in Yorkshire, six in Notts, and eight in Gloucestershire, receiving in lieu of them thirty-three impropriations and advoAvsons of dissolved religious houses. Among the thus alienated manors in Notts, Sutton and Scrooby were included; but in 1553 Archbishop Heath prevailed upon Queen Mary to restore to the see the lordship of Ripon, with certain manors appertaining thereto, and also Southwell and five more manors in Notts, among which doubtless Sutton and Scrooby were included, inasmuch as the archbishop possesses estates at both places to this day. Leland, in 1541, tells us that at Scrooby he saAv \" a great manor-place standinge withyn a mote, and longging to the archbishop of York, builded yn to courses, Avhercof the first is very ample and all builded of tymbre, saving the front of the haulc, that is of bricke, to the wych ascenditur per gradus lapidis. The ynner courtc building, as far as I marked, was of tymber building, and Avas not in compace past the 4 parte of the utter courte.\" Eleven years previous to this visit of Leland, the once great but now fallen Wolsey took Southwell; NeAvstead; Worksop Park, not staying there, however, although \"as he rode through the parke both my lorde of Shrewsbury's servants and also the aforesaid gentlemen moved him once againe (to hunt), before Avhome the deare lay very fairc for all purposes of pleasure ;\" Rufford Abbey; and Blythe Abbey, where he passed the night; on his way to Scrooby, where, adds his biographer, \" most commonly every Sonday (if the weather did serve) he would travaile unto some pore parish churche there aboute and there Avould say his divine service and that done be would dine in some honest house in the towne, Avhere should be distributed to the people a great almes of mcate and drinke, or of money And thus with other good dedes practising and exercising himself during his abode there, as making of love daies and agreements betweene party and party being at variance, he daily frequented himself there abouts.\" In the 4th and 5th of Philip and Mary, Nicholas Heath, archbishop, granted a lease of all his manor house, or chief mansion place, of Scrooby, with the park and lands, for twenty-one years, at an annual rent of 20<!. 15s., to James Bryne, steward of his household. In the 17th Elizabeth, Edmund Grindal, archbishop, leased the said manor for the same term at a rent of 21?. 2s. 6d. to William Marshall, of Much Haddham, in the county of Hertford. And then came Edwin Sandys, who was raised to the archiepiscopal throne in 1576, and who leased the manor of Scrooby to his son Samuel, of the Middle Temple. Under him a family of the name of BreAvster occupied the manor house of Scrooby, which had gradually and insensibly dwindled down, through lapse of ages, from a large mansion to a moderately-sized farm-house. And now the stream of time conducts us to a marvellous revolution. From the lordly metropolitan of the North, who was ever attended with almost a princely retinue \u2014 s"], [148, "130 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. who claimed suit and service and fealty and homage from his vassals of the North Soke \u2014 from Avhose hands ordained priests received upon their bended knees the cure and government of souls in their benefices, and before Avhom and his numerous household divine service was daily celebrated by his OAvn chaplains in his own chapel, \u2014 we pass to a small congregation of earnest, although I think mistaken, men, who, dissatisfied with the ceremonies and discipline, possibly with the doctrines too, of the Established Church, assembled themselves in the now, comparatively speaking, humble manor house of Scrooby for religious worship under the ministration of one who had received no ordination. William Brewster had been private secretary to Davidson, the Secretary of State under Queen Elizabeth, who himself had a strong leaning to Puritanism. On the disgrace of that minister he returned to Scrooby, which probably was his native place, and there formed a small congregation of \" Brownists\" or \" Separatists,\" among whom was William Bradford, a native of Austerfield, in the parish of Blyth. In 1608 these Separatists, now numbering in their body several hundreds, left England for Amsterdam, where they resided for one year. They spent the next eleven years at Leyden, and, removing to New Plymouth in 1620, became the founders of the parent colony of New England, having Bradford for their Governor and Brewster as the Elder of their congregation. And hence it is that educated and accomplished men from America are perpetually visiting with feelings of deep filial affection and veneration the villages of Austerfield and Scrooby, from which sprang the first founders of their country. I conclude this chapter by adding, that mounds of the fish-ponds of Scrooby Palace still remain. The manor-house itself is simply a plain farm tenement, with a lofty and round-headed arch, now blocked up, in one wall, which probably once formed a carriage entrance, and a niche in another. An old and tottering mulberry tree is recorded to have been planted by Cardinal Wolsey. And these are all the remains of the archiepiscopal palace of Scrooby. Sic transit! Beda, Eccl.

This township, in its superficial dimensions, exceeds considerably any other in the parish of Blyth, and is one of the largest townships, simply and properly so called, in the kingdom. It contains 4,110 acres of land, and comprises the following districts or subdivisions: Great Hod sock, Little Hodsock, Spital, Holm, Goldthorp, Costrup, Hodsock Woodhouse, Hermeston, and Fleecethorp. Hodsock \u2014 Ordsoc \u2014 is the soc of Ord, as Ordsall, in the immediate neighbourhood, is the hall of Ord. I offer this origin of the word with diffidence, but it is the best which suggests itself to my mind. The manor has since the Conquest acknowledged but four families as its lords, those namely of Torald de Lisoriis (or de Lizours), Cressy, Clifton, and Mellish. Ulsy was the Saxon owner. He was succeeded by Torald as the sub-infeudatory of the chief1 lord Roger, whom we find returned in the Domesday Report as possessing his own manorial court, to which Blyth paid certain suit and s'ervice, as holding two carucates, and having upon his property three sochmen with four bovates of land, and twelve villeins with nine carucates. There were two mills also, eight acres of meadow and pasturable wood one leuka long and half as much in breadth. The value of the whole then and previously, 60s. Torald de Lizours and his brother Fulc were two of the witnesses of the deed of foundation of the monastery of Blyth by Roger de Builli in 1088; and from the latter of them sprang, by the female side, the noble house of Fitzwilliam. The Cressys, too, were great men. They often stood in the distant battle-fields of foreign climes against the Payhim hosts for the recovery of the Holy- Sepulchre, and at home took a prominent share in the stirring transactions of the nation. They were munificent benefactors to the religious of Blyth, who, after their mortal toil was ended, gave their bones a resting-place in their church under richly and elaborately carved monuments and effigies, which the ruthless hand of man has long since destroyed. And the Cliftons are a time honoured race, lords of Clifton and Hodsock for centuries, holding posts of great eminence and importance in the public service, and intermarrying with the best blood of the kingdom. So much by way of introduction to the history of Hodsock, into the more minute details of which I shall now enter. I commence then by stating that Fulc Lizours had considerable possessions in Nottingham shire as well as in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, by grant from Builli. Among other places he was a proprietor in Olcotes, and in that township gave lands to the convent of Blyth. It will there- s2"], [150, "132 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. fore be more convenient to reserve my account of him and of his descendants, until I come to speak of that village. G First Lord of Hodsock \u2014 Torald de Lizours. His brother Torald enjoyed from his superior lord, Roger, grants of estates not only in Hodsock but also in East Markham, Kelham, and Weston, in which last place he adjoined his brother. He appears for the last time in any public record, as far as I am aware, as witness to the foundation deed of Blyth Abbey. But the surname of Thorold, which is evidently derived from him, has continued to exist since his days in this and the adjoining county of Lincoln. The Cressys, Second Lords of Hodsock. Roger Cressy, of Avhom I shall speak immediately, Avas nephew of Avicia de Tani the first Avife of William de Clairfait or Fitz-Godric. Noav, as this William married for his second wife Albreda de Lizours, the grand-daughter of Fulc the brother of Torald de Lizours, it is not improbable that Roger Cressy Avas indebted to this connection for his succession to Hodsock. The Cressys had various estates in the parish of Blyth, as well as at Gedling, Rampton, Kelham, Weston, and East Markham \u2014 in the last three of which, as Avell as in Hodsock, thev appear to have succeeded Torald \u2014 and at Risegate, Braytoft, and Exton, in Lincolnshire, and Melton-on the-Hill in Yorkshire. Branches of them Avere settled at Hodsock, Olcotes, and Holm, in this parish, as well as at East Markham, and in Lincolnshire. The very name recalls the warlike days of Edward III.; but, assuming that this ancient family derived their name from continental soil, still they Avere settled at Hodsock long before the battle of Cressy. For in the days of Henry II. Roger de Cressy comes before us as lord of Hodsock, and places upon the altar of St. Mary of Blyth an instrument conveying to the monks the donation of half a bovate of land in Olcotes, and the tithe of all his mills in his soc of Hodsock, in return for which the convent give him, his ancestors and successors, four masses weekly. Roger married Cecily daughter of Gervase Clifton of Clifton, and left her a -widow Avith a son Williarn, who, as a minor, was under the feudal wardship of the lady paramount, under the Crown, of the honour of Tickhill, Alice the countess of Eu, and held of her Hodsock with soc by service of one knight's fee. Between William and his mother no very friendly or affectionate feeling appears to have existed. The one denied that the other had been laAvfully married, and refused to give her dower. Such Avas the venality and corruption of the Crown in those days, that both mother and son gave large bribes to King John, the first that she might be put in possession of her jointure, the second that he might be discharged from allowing it. An appeal was made to the archbishop of York, whose sentence not proving satisfactory, William de Cressy offered wager of battle to try the matter by single combat. Eventually, the dispute was settled at Clarendon in 1204, the widow receiving half a knight's fee in Melton and five acres of meadow in Lokenges. And now we are ushered upon the arena of national strife and rebellion. The intestine troubles and commotions which rent the kingdom during the successive reigns of Henry II., Richard I., John, and Henry III., fall within the province of the general historian. The superficial"], [151, "133 THE CRESSYS, SECOND LORDS OF HODSOCK. observer will content himself with attributing them to the restless, ambitious, and turbulent spirit of the royal princes or of the nobles ; but he Avho looks beneath the surface of events and sees ever there a powerful under-current, who traces in all things here below the finger of Him who ordereth the affairs both of men and nations, will, when he carefully reflects upon the transactions of these four reigns, be forcibly reminded of another and a far remote period, Avhen the audible sentence \" Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house,\" and the visible effects of rebellion and of a disastrous train of other evils, were placed in the closest connection of cause and effect Avith each other; and he will think it neither superstitious, nor uncharitable, nor unphdosophical to infer from the like disasters of these reigns a like divine sentence preceding them, and going forth against him Whose sacrilegious blow Had at God's altar slain his foe \u2014 against whom, as against the King of Israel, his oAvn sons took up arms \u2014 and who lived to pronounce against them in the bitterness of his soul the very curse which his sin and their sins had provoked. The sons of Henry II. had not only learned but taught the lesson of rebellion during their father's lifetime. Against themselves consequently as they came to the throne and against each other were turned the very arms which had been lifted against their father. The cowardice and the oppression of John placed England, not figuratively only, but literally, in a state of con flagration. His odious and tyrannical conduct roused the nobility and gentry of the land to resistance, and to the vindication of their oppressed liberties. This resistance so enraged the King, that, in the words of Hume, he \" let loose ravenous and barbarous mercenaries against the estates, tenants, manors, houses, parks of the barons, and spread devastation over the face of the kingdom. Nothing was to be seen but the flames of villages and castles reduced to ashes, the consternation and misery of the inhabitants, and tortures exercised by the soldiery to make them reveal their concealed treasures The King, marching through the whole extent of England from Dover to Berwick, laid the provinces waste on each side of him.\" During the preceding reign of Richard I. the estates of Ralph de Cossard and of Philip of Olcotes, both neighbours of William Cressy, had been forfeited, because they had conspired with Earl John against their sovereign ; but now John himself has foes in arms against him in the very same locality. Maurice de Gaunt, John the Constable of Chester, Gerard de Furnival, and William Cressy, all of them great and powerful men in our immediate neighbourhood, are, like the rest of England, asserting their liberties against a tyrant, and are compelled to fly. John is at Merriel Bridge and at Hodsock December 30 and 31, 1215, and January 1, 1216. From the first-named place he issues letters of safe-conduct to John the Constable of Chester to give him the chance of coming in to make his peace. From Hodsock similar letters are issued to Maurice de Gaunt, Gerard de Furnival, and William Cressy. Cressy 's letters stand good to the Sunday after the Circumcision \u2014 Henry de Gray, Robert de Cardinans, and Reginald de Valletort meanwhile under taking between him and his sovereign that his house shall not be sired if he returns to his allegiance within the prescribed time, but that if he does not, they will execute the King's orders with regard both to house and everything in it. William Cressy was a man not only of an active and courageous mind and spirit, but also of"], [152, "134 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. an enlarged and benevolent heart. He founded an hospital for leprous persons on the south side of Blyth, in the territory of Hodsock; he established a chapel for religious service at his hall; and he was a considerable benefactor to the convent of Blyth. Of the hospital and chapel I shall speak presently. In reference to the convent, he not merely confirmed the donations of his father, but in addition gave the monks the dams of his mills from the bridge of Gildenbriges to the land of Swain Sarpesive in the same condition in which they were in the year 1225, the free farm of the dam of the mills of Westcroft in his land on payment of half a quarter of wheat at Michaelmas in lieu of all services, and the rent of I2d. which they had been in the habit of paying him for land in Holm. Roger, the son and heir of William Cressy, married Sibilla, daughter and heir of John de Braytoft, of Risegate, in the parish of Surfleet and county of Lincoln. The Braytofts took their name from and possessed estates at Braytoft, in the same county, as well as at Risegate. In the latter place they held immediately under the King as lord paramount. Sibilla consequently was his Avard, and no one could marry her without his consent and without discharging the obligation due to him as superior lord. Roger neglected these conditions, and was compelled to pay to Henry III. (26th of his reign) 100 shillings as a fine. He gave to the monks of Blyth all his meadow land at Holm Mill, on the west side thereof, between the road from Olcotes to Blyth, and \" the stream which runs between my meadow and that of William de Kelishot.\" In return for Avhich he adds in his charter, \" the prior and convent have granted me, as well as my father and mother, a share in all advantages, alms, and prayers, which now are or hereafter shall be offered in the said church, as if I were one of them.\" William, the son of Roger and Sibilla Cressy, made a singular concession to the prior and convent of Blyth. He granted to them and to the abbot of St. Katharine at Rouen, as their ecclesiastical superior, permission to hang on the gallows at Emmeslaw robbers apprehended within the liberty of Blyth, reserving to himself the power of executing at the same place robbers taken within Hodsock liberty. We have already seen that a certain parcel of land within the township of Barnby Moor is defined as bordering upon the gallows of Blyth. In that direction, therefore, we must look for its situation, and in that direction accordingly \u2014 namely, at Blyth Law Hill, tradition has fixed the ancient spot where criminals were executed. The convent received this poAver from their founder. The lords of Hodsock exercised similar power, and it would seem, therefore, that in process of time they made one place serve for both liberties. I shall now lay before my readers the Pedigree of Cressy of Hodsock, beginning with Roger, who stands at the head of the preceding history, and terminating with the sisters and co-heirs of Sir Hugh Cressy, Katharine and Elizabeth, who married respectively Sir John Clifton and Sir John Markham."], [153, "135 THE CRESSYS, SECOND LORDS OF HODSOCK.

Risegate and Braytoft go to his wife for her life, and then to his heirs. She is charged with a legacy of 250 marks to his daughter Katharine, 200 marks to Juliana, 1001. to Elizabeth, AOL to Agnes, for their marriage portions. Proved at Nettleham, Feb. 16, 1347. His son and heir Sir John Cressy dates his will in the sixth of Richard II. He desires to be buried in the church of Surfleet. He leaves to Agnes and Hawisia, his sisters, nuns, 40s. each ; to the nunnery at Hampole, 20s. ; to the Austin Friars of Tickhill, 20s. ; to John Say, the parochial chaplain of Blyth, 20s.; and small legacies, among others, to Robert Hoddesacke and Amote de Hoddesack. Proved at Nettleham, Sept. 7, 1383. Both father and son, we observe, are buried in Surfleet Church. The first does not leave a single legacy to either rich or poor in the parish of Blyth ; the second only two legacies to persons in Hodsock, and one to the chaplain of the parish. All their sympathies appear to have been with the county of Lincoln. I infer from these facts that the Cressys, for some time previous to the division of their estates by the marriages of the two co-heirs Katharine and Elizabeth, had made Risegate their chief residence. We further perceive that among the ladies of this family no less than four were nuns, and that Sir John leaves a legacy of 20s. to the nunnery of Hampole near Doncaster. Now the Cressys claimed a connection with the founders of this religious house, William de Clairfait or Fitz-Godric, the ancestor of the Fitz-Williams, and Avicia his wife. This connection will probably explain the motive of the legacy above named, and lead to the conclusion that the four ladies were inmates in the nunnery of Hampole. By an Inquisition taken in the year of the death of Sir Hugh Cressy, the last male heir of the family, viz. 9th Henry IV. it was found that he was possessed at the time of his decease in fee tail of the manors of Hodsock, Risegate, Claypole, and one-fourth of the manor of Braytoft, and that Katharine, widow of Sir John Clifton, and Robert Markham, son of his other sister, Elizabeth, were his heirs. In the folloAving year a partition of the estates was made at Retford, by which Hodsock and Claypole went to Katharine and the Cliftons; Risegate, Braytoft, and Exton to the Markhams. I shall speak as concisely as I can of the Markhams and of the Lincolnshire residence of the Cressys at Cressy Hall in Risegate, and then pursue the history of Hodsock under its new lords the Cliftons. At Cotham, then, about four miles south of Newark, Thomas de Leyk, 38th Edward III. held a knight's fee under the family of D'Eyncourt, the tenants in chief. This descended through some generations of the Leeks. Elizabeth, sister and co-heir of Sir Hugh Cressy, married, as we have seen, Sir John Markham, of Sedgebrook, co. Lincoln, one of the Judges of the King's Bench. The issue of this marriage was a son, Sir Robert Markham, who also had a son Robert. The Judge married for his second wife Milicent, daughter of ... . Bekering, and widow of Sir Nicholas Burdon. By his second wife he had a son, Sir John Markham, who was eventually Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and married Margaret, the daughter of Simon Leek, Esq. of Cotham. Sir Robert Markham, the grandson of the first Judge by his first marriage, married Joanna the daughter of Sir Giles D'Aubeney by Mary the eldest daughter of the above-mentioned Simon"], [155, "137 THE CRESSYS, SECOND LORDS OF HODSOCK. Leek, Esq. and thus became possessed of Cotham through his wife, who by marriage was niece of the Chief Justice. Cotham became in this manner the principal seat of the Markhams. Sir John Markham, the great-grandson of the Judge, who married Elizabeth Cressy, was at the battle of Stoke near Newark in 1487, in which Henry VII. defeated the Earl of Lincoln and the party who espoused the cause of Lambert Simnel. Subsequently to this, according to the records of the family, having had a dispute with the inhabitants of Long Bennington respecting the boundaries of that township and Cotham, and having in the strife put some of them to death, he was compelled to seek shelter in the old Hall of the Cressys at Risegate, where he had the honour of entertaining the Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, and mother of Henry VII. who made a match between his son John and her kinswoman Anne daughter of Sir Georjre Neville. G G From this family descended the Markhams of Ollerton. The last Sir Robert Markham, the great-great-grandson of Sir John of Avhom I have been speaking, was an improvident man, and squandered away the estates of his ancestors. Thoroton's very brief and expressive language is, \" Sir Robert Markham of Cotham destroyed the famdy.\" He appears to have sold Cressy Hall with the manor of Risegate to Sir Edward Heron, who was Baron of the Exchequer in 1607. The last male descendant of Sir Edward, Henry Heron, M.P. for the county of Lincoln in 1722, died in 1730, and left his estate, failing the issue of his sisters, to Patrick Heron, a Scotchman, and distant connection. Cressy Hall, Avith the chapel attached to it, saving only two relics, was burnt doAvn toAvards the close of the last century, and replaced by a modern brick house which goes by the same name, and, together with an estate of about three hundred and twenty acres, belongs to the Rev. Thomas Sherlock Nelson, rector of St. Peter at Arches, Lincoln. There is a recumbent figure in the church of Surfleet traditionally said to be that of Roger Cressy, who married Sibilla de Braytoft. No momfmental brasses or inscriptions remain. The two relics referred to above are \u2014 a door of oak with grooved panels and studded with nails, which is said to have belonged to the chapel, and a stone with the following inscription : \u2014 THIS CHAPPELL WAS BY LI CENCE IN YE REIGNE OF KING EDWARD YE 2D NO 1308 AND REPAIRED IN Y1 YEARE OF YE REIGNE OF KING CHARLES THE 2D 1G66 Avhere nothing has been effaced ; but the stone-cutter has omitted Avords and letters. We now come to \u2014 The Cliftons, the Third Lords of Hodsock, Avho succeeded to this property, the reader will bear in mind, 10 Henry IV. or 1409, shortly after the death of Sir Hugh Cressy, whose sister Katharine had married Sir John Clifton. T"], [156, "138 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. About the close of the reign of Henry III. we find the Cliftons establishing themselves at Clifton and Wilford, both of them situated on the Trent, a little to the south of Nottingham. It Avas about that time that Sir Gervase de Clifton purchased these manors of Gerard de Rhodes. Cecilia Clifton, the wife of Roger Cressy, of whom mention has been made, was his aunt. In the reign of Edward I. Sir Gervase was high-sheriff of the counties of Nottingham and Derby, as well as of York. In the twelfth year of this king's reign Robert de Tibtot, the Constable of Nottingham Castle, demised the castle and precincts to him for a term of years, and hence probably arose the high-sounding but somewhat apocryphal title of guardianus Castelli de Nottingham assigned to his ancestors in the old Visitations. In an ancient instrument of the date of 13 Edward I. he is styled Gervase de Wilford; and it would appear that a branch of the Cliftons retained this surname, one of whom, Gervase de Wilford, Avas Chief Baron of the Exchequer 24 Edward III. The Sir Gervase Clifton of Edward the First's reign married Amflisia, daughter of Sir William Sampson of Eperston, and thenceforth the line appears to descend in the folloAving manner: \u2014 Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton and Wilford ;-[-Amflisia, dau. of Sir William Sampson of Eperston ; ob. 17 Edw.

Sir Gervase Clifton, the husband successively of Margaret Pierrepont and of Isabel . . . ., had licence from the king, 22 Edward III. to endow three chaplaincies in the church of St. Mary of Clifton. It is doubtful, however, whether he executed his intention; for, if Thoroton's statement is to be relied on, it was Sir Robert Clifton, the grandson of Sir John just named, who began to found the college dedicated to the Holy Trinity at Clifton, which, as he died before accomplishing his design, was completed by his son Sir Gervase, and herewith agrees the inscription in Clifton church over the grave of Sir Robert, who died in 1478, and is called fundator trium capellanorum collegii in hac ecclesia. And now, having cleared the preliminary history of this ancient family, we come at once to the marriage between the Cliftons and Cressys, by which Hodsock came to the former. I propose in the first instance giving as accurate a Pedigree of their descent from that time as I can, and I shall attach to it numerals by way of reference to the account subsequently to be given of different members of the house."], [157, "139 THE CLIFTONS, THIRD LORDS OF HODSOCK.

Katharine his wife was buried in Blyth church, in a part which now unhappily is levelled to the ground; for her son Sir Gervase Clifton, in his will, dated Nov. 25, 1453, requests that he may be buried \" before the high altar of the monastery of St. Mary of Blyth, against the sepulchre of Dame Katharine Clifton his mother.\" (3). Ralph Makarell dates his will at Hodsock, Jan. 20, 1434. He desires to be buried in the abbey of Dale, an establishment of Pr\u00e6monstratensians, near Derby; the prior of Blyth to have his best animal as a principal : \" et in esculentis et poculentis fiat secundum voluntatem executorum meorum.\" He must have been a person in affluent circumstances, and of great consi deration in his day, for in the post mortem inquisition taken 14th Henry VI. very shortly after his death, we find that he died seised not merely of estates which came to him by virtue of his marriage with Katharine the widow of Sir John Clifton, but of others also. Thus he had property at Claypole and Downhall in Claypole, in the county of Lincoln; at Wilsthorp, Braydeston, and Stanton juxta Sandiacre, in the county of Derby; and at Carlton in Lindrick, Stretton, Fenton in the Clay, Blyth (14 acres of land and the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist), Woodhouse (a messuage and 40 acres of land, &c), Misterton, Stockwith, Hay ton, Walkeringham , and Hodsock, in the county of Nottingham ; the last seven estates being held under the honour of Tickhill. (4). This Sir Gervase was in the court of Edward IV., in the 11th and 17th years of whose reign he was sheriff of Nottingham and Derby. He was also receiver-general of those counties, steward of the King's manors of Gedling, Shelford, Stoke-Bardolf, and others; as well as surveyor of the King's works and repairs in his castle of Nottingham, and his lodges of Barkwood Park and Clipston. It is stated in the writ to the officers appointed to take his account, that \" he had bought for the same buildings and reparations timber, stones, &c. and paid also wages of joiners, glaziers, and others.\" This was in 1480. He was created Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Richard III. who gave him in the first year of his reign the manors of Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Kegworth,"], [159, "141 THE CLIFTONS, THIRD LORDS OF HODSOCK. Kington, Overton-Longville, Dalbury, Dalbury Lyes, Etwell, and Wirksworth, which had belonged chiefly to the Dukes of Buckingham and Exeter. He sailed secundo flumine ; for we find Henry VII. granting him the guardianship of the estates of George Lord Fitz-Hugh of Ravens worth, in the North Riding, then a minor, at Carlton in Lindrick and Kingston in Carlton. On the marriage of his son Gervase he settled, Jan. 10, 22nd Edward IV. on trusts for his use and that of his heirs the manors of Clifton, Wilford, Broughton Sulney, Avith the advowsons of the churches, and the soc of Hodsock, comprising Hodsock, Holm, Olcotes, Hermeston, Fleecethorp, Styrrup, Letwell, and Gilding-wells.

To the poore of Blith and Barnby 101.\" Sir Gervase died June 28, 1666, and was buried \" pompa decors,\" as his monument in Clifton church expresseth, Aug. 2 following. The closing scene is thus graphically described by Tho roton, the author of our County History, and himself a physician, who appears to have attended Sir Gervase professionally in his last moments. \" His port and hospitality exceeded very many of the nobility, and his continuance in it most men, being almost fourscore years lord of this place, of a sound body and a cheerful facetious spirit, yet in his latter time timorous, so that his last part was miracle enough to convert an Atheist, to see his Christianity so far prevail over his nature, that, without the least shadow of fear, unwearied Avith pain, grief, or sickness, he left the choicest things of this world Avith as great pleasure as others enjoy them. He received from me the certain notice of his near approaching death, as he was wont to do an invitation of good friends to his own bowling-green (one of the most pleasant imaginable), and thereupon immedi ately called for his old chaplain, Mr. Robert Thirleby (Master of the Hospital at Blyth), to do the office of his confessor, as if it had been to attend him to that recreation he often used and loved ; and, Avhen he had done with him, for his children, Avhom patriarch-like he particularly blessed and admonished, with the smartness and ingenuity of an excellent and Avcll-studied orator. The day"], [162, "144 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. following he received visits from divers friends, in the old dining-room near his bed-chamber, who were not so sensible of his danger, because he entertained them after his usual manner \u2014 yet that night (as I easily foretold him) his sleepiness began, which could never be taken away, by reason that both his ureters were so petrified (as things are by the dropping well near Knaves burgh in Yorkshire) that no urine could descend into his bladder, as at the opening of his body did manifestly appear, as also that one of his kidneys had of long time before been totally stopt with a wonderful great stone, as is reported of the pious and learned Dr. Hammond, whose hair was also red, like that of this worthy Sir Gervase; who died June 28, 1666, and was buried the 2d of August following, with great solemnity, Mr. Dugdale, Norroy, Mr. Ashmole, Windsor, and Mr. Ryley, Lancaster, heralds, the quire of Southwell, and many mourners attending his funeral.\" (7). Robert, described as of Blyth Spital, was a Roman Catholic. The baptisms of his children in 1701 and the next year or two are recorded in the Blyth Register apart from others. Clifton was evidently the burial-place of the family, although they resided both at Clifton and Hodsock, and there remain in the church at Clifton some good monumental brasses of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There were also in Thoroton's time many quarterings of arms in the windows, such as those of the families of Cressy, Freschevill, Grey, Pierrepont, Braytoft, Francis, and others. The course of events and the unceasing vicissitude of all human things and possessions bring us now to The Mellishes, the Fourth Possessors of Hodsock. Edward Mellish, the second of that name, who died, as the reader will perceive by referring to the pedigree of the family already given, in 1757, left, in addition to other property, certain estates at Skegby, North Marnham, South Marnham, Sutton-upon-Trent, Weston, Normanton, and Haughton, in the county of Nottingham, together with land and tithes at Moss, in the parish of Campsall, in the county of York, to his brother William, to Charles the son of William, and then in tail male. About 1762 William and Charles Mellish obtained an Act to enable them to sell these distant estates and to purchase other property nearer to Blyth, \"where the capital seat of the familv and the chief part of the settled estate of the said William Mellish\" were situate. Accordingly by virtue of this power they purchased of Sir Gervase Clifton, in 1765, the present Hodsock estate, consisting of the farms severally occupied by William Leigh Mellish, Esq., Mr. Ashton, and Mr. Gibbs, the estates of Goldthorp, Hodsock Woodhouse or Costrup, Hodsock Park, Hodsock Forest, Fleecethorp, and the farm known as Cowliskaws Farm. Of these estates I shall speak in due time in succession. In the same year they also purchased of Sir Gervase Clifton the lease of the rectory of Blyth under Trinity College, Cambridge, and the manors and considerable property in Carlton in Lindric, portions of which they re-sold immediately to John White of Wallingwells, Esq., Ralph Knight of Langold, Esq., and others; and nearly all the remainder, about 1774, to Mrs. Ramsden, the grandmother of the present Mr. Ramsden of Carlton Hall. It was Charles Mellish, I believe, who entailed the present Hodsock estate for three lives. It"], [163, "145 THE HALL OR MANSION OF HODSOCK. was enjoyed in succession by his widow, his son Henry Francis Mellish, and his daughter Ann, the Avidow of William Cecil Chambers, Esq., who died in August, 1855, bequeathing it to her cousin William Leigh Mellish, the present Avorthy and kind-hearted possessor, Avho, as lord of the manor of Hodsock, has had through the long course of eight centuries but three names, and those very eminent ones, Lizours, Cressy, and Clifton preceding him; and who, although he is confined within a narrower territory than that of which his ancestors once could boast, has still the power, as happily he has the disposition, to prove himself a considerate landlord, a kind neighbour, and a charitable friend to the poor. The Hall or Mansion of Hodsock. We have no evidence that a residence existed here in times preceding the Conquest. If indeed I am correct in my etymology, the name of Hodsock indicates manorial rights and possessions of Ord. The Domesday Survey gives us also the name of another owner, Ulsy; but it makes no mention of an aula, nor is it clear that Toaald, the sub-infeudatory of the Norman lord Roger, had a residence here. But when we come to the Cressys Ave are left in no doubt upon the subject. In the reign of Henry II. we have Roger Cressy bestowing a benefaction upon the monastery of Blyth; we have his son William confirming and expanding the endowment of his father and found ing an hospital near Blyth \u2014 acts these all of them indicating the sympathies of near neighbours. Not only so; we have William establishing a chapel at Hodsock, and in the same reign, that of John, Ave have the king himself dating documents at Hodsock. Edward I. again was in Notting hamshire A.D. 1280. During the first five days of August his writs are dated either in Sherwood or at Clipston, where he had a palace. August 7th he was at Hodsock, \" Oddisak\"; and in 1293 we find him on his return from the North again at \" Hadesak \" on the 16th February. The Cressys therefore had a residence here from early times. It Avas moated, and the moat is the only secular feature of the Cressy mansion which remains. The present gateAvay of brick, with its quasi-machicolated parapet, its spacious chamber, and its solid flanking turrets, belongs to the \u00e6ra of the Cliftons; and it is the only portion of the Clifton mansion which has survived the wreck of time. No document exists to fix the precise date of this interesting structure \u2014 the most ancient brick-building Avhich Ave have in our district. I confess however that I have felt strongly inclined to assign its construction to Sir Gervase Clifton, in the second part of the fifteenth century. My reasons for doing so are these: (1) Sir Gervase, as we have seen, Avas an opulent and prosperous man, having received large accession of property by \"\u2022rant from Richard III., and therefore was well able to execute a costly undertaking of this nature; and (2) as surveyor of the castle of Nottingham and of the royal palaces of BarkAvood and ( 'lipston, and of the repairs thereof, he must have acquired considerable experience in the practical details of building, even if he did not possess originally a taste for it. But then on the other hand Sir William Dugdale records in his Visitation of Nottinghamshire in 1662 the existence of six shields, which were cut in stone over a bay-windoAv of the Hall, and were charged with, 1. A trefoil, the emblem of perpetuity ; 2. The arms of Clifford, Cheeky or and azure, a fess gules; 3. A scroll Avith the name \" Robert Clifton;\" 4. Blank; 5. Clifford arms a\u00b0*ain, with their quartering of Vipont; 6. Arms impaled, the arms of the husband Avanting, t"], [164, "146 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. probably defaced as Avell as No. 4, but three quarterings of the wife's remaining, Adz. a cross, 2 bars, and a chief indented. Now as Robert Clifton married for his second wife Anne, daughter of Henry lord Clifford, and as his own name appears among the shields, the inference is irresistible that he was the builder of the old Clifton Hall, if not of the gate-way at Hodsock, and that he left a record of himself and of the illustrious house into which he had married in the scroll and shields above mentioned. If this inference is correct, the hall, if not the gateway, was built at the very beginning of the sixteenth century. The Cliftons appear to have resided occasionally at least at Hodsock down to the time of the first Baronet in the seventeenth century, some of whose children, as we have seen, were born there and baptized at Blyth. And Mr. Clifton Rhodes, his son-in-laAv, is described as \"of Hodsoke\" in 1653, when the baptism of his son Godfrey is recorded. Subsequently to this they appear to have abandoned the place, Avhich gradually sank to the condition of a good farm-house, with no A'estige, as far as 1 know, of the old mansion remaining, save only the gate-way and chamber over it. It has been occupied at intervals by the widow of Mr. Charles Mellish, who died there in 1806; by Lieut.-Colonel Mellish, who also died there in 1817; and since his death by his sister Mrs. Chambers, who by a considerable enlargement of the house in 1829, and by continued and judicious improvements of the pleasure-grounds and adjacent buildings, has given to Hodsock an appearance of beauty, and elevated it to a becoming position among the seats of the gentry of Nottinghamshire. The Chapel of Hodsock. The earliest notice on record of a Chapel at Hodsock occurs in an exemplification of the year 1455. On the 24th of April in that year, Robert Clifton of Hodsock appeared at Scrooby before William Maister, the chancellor of William Archbishop of York, the brother-in-law of Clifton, and produced and prayed that copy and registration might be made of two letters, the first of which ran in these words: \" To all faithful servants of Christ who shall see or hear this present writing, Gilbert prior of Blyth and the convent of the same place send greeting, Know ye that we have granted, and by this our present charter have confirmed, to William Cressy, and to his heirs, all oblations offered at his chapel in his hall of Hoddesak for the support of a chaplain, whom the said WiUiam shall find to minister there, saving to us the confessions of Lent and the oblations at Easter, and all the tithes of the Hall.\" The charter then goes on to grant to the said William and his heirs a chaplain for the hospital on the south side of Blyth, in the territory of Hodsock, whom soever he and his heirs may appoint. In my account of the monastery of Blyth already given, we find Gilbert prior of the house in 1224.* The second letter produced by Clifton throws additional light upon the date of foundation of the chapel of Hodsock. It is a bull of Pope Honorius to the rector and brethren of the House of Lepers of St. John the Evangelist without Blyth, promising the protection of the Holy See to the possessions and liberties conferred upon them by the prior and convent of Blyth, and by * Vide supra, p. 36."], [165, "THE CHAPEL OF HODSOCK. 147 William de Cressy their pious founder, and is dated at the Lateran in the 10th year of his pontifi cate. Noav, of the four popes of this name, the only one from whom this bull could have emanated was Honorius III., who sat in the papal chair from 1216 to 1227. We have therefore the convent granting permission in one and the same document to William Cressy to have a chaplain at Hodsock, and another chaplain for the hospital near Blyth founded by him, and a bull from the Pope in 1226 confirming the possessions and liberties which the founder and convent had granted the hospital. Hence we may conclude that both the hospital near Blyth and the chapel at Hodsock were in existence in 1226; and that they were both the pious work of William Cressy, the son of Roger Cressy and Cecilia Clifton. The motive which prompted the foundation of this and other chapels of a similar nature is obvious. They were founded for the benefit and convenience of those who were too far removed from their parish churches to participate generally in the priAdleges of religious worship there, and were exceedingly common throughout the kingdom. Thus, Barnby Moor, Costrup, and Serlby, in ancient times, possessed their own chapels, which have wholly disappeared. In our immediate neighbourhood again we haATe the remains of a beautiful chapel at Steetly ; and, to take a more distant example, on the banks of the Tecs, opposite to Gainford, stand the ruins of the chapel of the ancient family of the Pudseys of Barforth, of the same religious character. These, and similar religious structures, were designed, in the first instance, for the convenience of the lord of the manor and his household. Neighbouring families were gradually and properly admitted to a participation in the privileges of religious worship in them; and, where a village lay contiguous to the mansion of the proprietor, I think it highly probable that, in course of time, the chapel of the village superseded, if indeed it did not from the first constitute, the chapel of the hall. Such was the origin of the chapels of Bawtry, Austerfield, Anstan, Thorp-Salvin, Firbeck, Wales, St. John's, Letwell, and numerous others in this district. It is needless to add, that the great castles of the sovereigns and barons of England all possessed religious edifices of this description within their walls. There was such an edifice within the walls of Tickhill Castle, founded by Eleanor the queen of Henry II. Richmond Castle, in Yorkshire, contains the remains of two chapels, one of early Norman, the other of later date. There was another at Ravensworth Castle, near Richmond, the castle of the powerful and splendid family of Fitz-IIugh, the ruins of which, still grand in decay, impress the mind and heart of the visitor with feelings of deep solemnity, and the scroll around the bell-turret of Avhose chapel, familiar as it has been to me from the days of early boy hood, will remain indelibly impressed upon \" the mindful tablet of memory \" to my dying hour. .Jesus Xpbs Dominbs, Via, jFons. rt <Drigo, aipfia rt (Pmrga. To return to the chapel at Hodsock. I wish I could record, if not that it was standing entire, that we had at least as much of it remaining as we have of the chapel of Steetly within ten miles' distance. It is generally believed to have been situated a little to the south-west of the present hall, and was doubtless a gem of early-English architecture, which received, it would appear, additional embellishments in the succeeding style of church building \u2014 probably in the time of EdAvard II. when the chapel of Cressy Hall Avas built \u2014 for, in addition to pieces of early-English groining, and of an early-English doorway, we have a decorated piece of window tracery and a decorated corbel still in existence, and these few detached fragments are the only witnesses which survive to attest the ancient beauty and elegance of the chapel of the Cressys at Hodsock. u2"], [166, "148 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. I will only add, that, although the chapels to which I have just adverted\u2014 I mean the village chapels\u2014 enjoyed some, if not all, parochial rites, yet the chapel at Hodsock, not being surrounded by any considerable population, possessed none of these, with the exception, of course, of the Eucharist, neither baptisms, nor marriages, nor funerals having been ever, as far as I can discover, solemnized there. The Hospital and District called Spital. The hospital was situated, as Ave have seen, on the south side of Blyth, in the territory of Hodsock, and is expressly styled in the Bull of Honorius III. already cited, the House of Lepers of St. John the Evangelist, There is hardly a place of any importance in England where, in the existence of the local designation of \" Spital,\" the vestiges are not to be traced of eleemosynary foundations of this character. Camden, speaking of Burton-Lazars, near Melton Mowbray, tells us that \" Burton, called for distinction Lazars, from Lazars (so they named the Elephantiaci or Lepers) was a rich hospital, to the master of which all the lesser lazar-houses in England Avere in some sort subject, as he himself was to the master of the Lazars of Jerusalem. It is said to have been founded about the time of Henry I. by a general collection throughout England, but chiefly by the assistance of the Mowbrays, about which time the leprosy (by some called elephantiasis) did run by infection over all England.\" A similar establishment was founded at Sherburn, near Durham, by Bishop Pudsey in the twelfth century, the yearly revenues of which Avere certified in the reign of Henry VIII. as amounting to 142?. the society consisting of a master, several priests, and sixty-five brethren. Happily it escaped the spoliation of by-gone days, and its munificent endowments have afforded maintenance and an asylum to many an aged and needy man. The statement so often made, that the disease of leprosy was imported into the island during the age of the Crusades, is by no means destitute of probability. Whether this was really the origin of the disease in England, or whether it is attributable to the mode of living in early times, certain it is that the institution and endowment of these charitable foundations constituted one of the great features of the age and of the occupations of the wealthy. The hospital near Blyth was founded and endowed by William Cressy, lord of Hodsock, in the reign of John. It was dedicated to St. John the Evangelist; was designed for a warden or rector, three chaplains, and persons labouring under the disease of leprosy ; and the patronage was vested in the lords of Hodsock. What use they made of their privileges as patrons we shall presently see. Henry III. in a letter dated at NeAvark Jan. 5, 1230, takes under his protection the brethren of the hospital and their possessions, bids all his faithful subjects to defend them, and commends them to their charity, as they would have recompence from God and from him. Edward II., 18 May, 1316, gives permission to Hugh de Cressy to alienate seven messuages and four bovates of land in Blyth and Hodsock to three chaplains, who should celebrate divine offices daily in the chapel of St. John the Evangelist near Blyth. In this instance the king dispensed with the statute of mortmain, and acted against the recommendation of his escheator, Robert de Cliderhou, who had reported, that, inasmuch as the lands in question were held of the Honour of Tickhill, then in the Crown, it would be prejudicial to his interest to part with them,"], [167, "149 THE HOSPITAL AND DISTRICT CALLED SPITAL. as after Cressy's death, if his heir were a minor, he would lose the Avardship thereof. But there was a consideration in the case \u2014 a fine of twenty shillings, a large sum in those days. The brother of Hugh, Edmund de Cressy, executes an instrument at Hodsock, on Monday in the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, in the 14th EdAv. II., 1320, granting to William de Howelle and Philip de Ilkeston, chaplains, the hospital of St. John the Evangelist, with all lands, tenements, rents, meadows, pastures, and all their appurtenances belonging to the same, together with goods and chattels to the amount of twenty marcs, towards the support of the house. The chaplains undertake to celebrate religious offices in the chapel of the hospital, to find proper lights, to keep the buildings in good repair, and on their ceasing to officiate to leave behiad them goods to the value of twenty marcs. They are not allowed to appropriate to themselves any of the revenues. They may take into the hospital any person, spiritual or lay, at their discretion, by way of improving its income. Philip de Ilkeston shall pay as a subsidy at his entrance upon office four marcs : and the bursar shall render his account yearly before the bailiff of Cressy, Avbo reserves to himself the right of appointing a third chaplain when the rent of a messuage near the gate of the cemetery of the hospital will admit of it. A similar deed in old French, containing the appointment of Sir Robert de Russyn, late of Misson, as minister of the hospital, by Sir John Cressy, is dated at Hodsock in 1374. The Cliftons, as successors to the Cressys at Hodsock, of course possessed the patronage of the hospital. I have already stated that an Inquisition taken 14th Henry VI. represents Ralph Makarel, the second husband of Catharine Clifton, as having been seised inter alia of the hospital of St. John. About ten years later, viz. 21 July 1446, an indulgence of one hundred days was granted by the Archbishop of York to those who would contribute to \" the erection and new construction of a certain house, or hospital, for receiving and lodging poor strangers and pregnant women Avithin the village of Blyth.\" We may conclude therefore that the old hospital of the Cressys had fallen to decay in the fifteenth century, and that its original leprous inmates had disappeared. We come now to the time of Henry VIII., Avho, after he had pillaged the monasteries, appointed commissioners to survey and report upon the chantries, free chapels, and colleges, AAdth a view of course of treating them in the same manner. The points to be inquired into were these : 1, the names of the churches; 2, the value in the king's books; 3, present yearly value ; 4, whether parish churches or not; 5, whether full or void; 6, what lands, &c, belong to each ; 7, plate, ornaments, &c. ; 8, other preferment held by incumbent.* * \" The expenses of King Henry VIII., like sandy ground, suddenly sucked up the large shower of abbey lands, and little sign or show was seen thereof: yea, such the parching thirst of his pressing occasions, that still they called aloud for more moisture ; for whose satisfaction the Parliament in the 38th year of his reign put the lands of all colleges, chantries, and free chapels in his majesty's full disposition.\" \" The courtiers were more rapacious to catch and voracious to swallow these chantries than abbey-lands. For at the first many were scrupulous in mind or modest in manners, doubting the acceptance of abbey-land, though offered unto them, till profit and custom \u2014 two very able confessors, had by degrees satisfied their con sciences and absolved them from any fault therein. Now, all scruples removed, chantry-land went down without any regret. Yea, such who mannerly expected till the king carved for them out of abbey-lands scrambled for themselves out of chantry-revenues, as knowing this was the last dish of the last course, and after chantries, as after cheese, nothing to be expected.\" \u2014 Fuller, Ch. Hist. ii. 267, 275."], [168, "150 niSTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. From the Survey 37 Henry VIII., in the Augmentation Office, I give the following extract respecting the hospital of St. John : \u2014 \"(1). The Spitted of Blithe, which Robert Cressey, prieste, no we ha the and servithe two dayes in the weke, of the whiche two dayes he saithe masse at the said spitted by the commande ment of the Lorde of Hodsoke, as apperith by the gifte therof made unto him by Sir Jarvaise Clifton owte of Hodsok aboughte v. yers past, shewid to the commissioners : and other foundacion than is mencioned in the incumbent's gifte made by the said Sr Jarvasse Clyfton the incumbent knoweth not. (2). 8/. 14s. (3). 91. 2s. clear. (4). The same is no parish churche, but is distante from the churche of Blithe a quarter of a my lie, and the manor of Hodsoke is more than a myle from the said parish churche, which also is a very great parishe. (5). The same is not voyd. Whether ther be any mancion ther belonginge he answerithe not. (6). No more lands. (7). No plate, ornaments, goods, jewells, nor catalls, otherwise than one vestment and alter-cloth of no valewe, and a bell of small valewe.\" It is certain, as will appear, that the hospital of Blyth escaped the general pillage of chantries, free chapels, and colleges in the 37th Henry VIII. and 2nd Edw. VI. on the ground, probably, that it was an hospital * I conclude from the above report that Robert Cressy, who was also Vicar of Blyth, was paid a yearly stipend by the Cliftons for his religious services to the poor inmates of the hospital \u2014 the Cliftons retaining the lands of the house in their own hands, or in those of their tenants. The latter part of this statement is rendered indisputable by what follows. For I have before me leases or recitals of leases from the Cliftons in 1648, 1662, and 1692, in which they associate themselves jointly with the master and brethren of the hospital as lessors, and the nature of which is of a beneficial tendency as far as they are concerned. They reserve simply to the master and his poor brethren \"the house adjoining to the said house or hospital appointed and used to and for the harbour, habitation, and dwelling of the poor of the said house or hospital ;\" and the yearly rent of III. 10s. 6d. And yet that the landed endowments of tins foundation were considerable, an indenture executed in 1706 leaves us no room whatever to doubt, for in it Sir Gervase Clifton covenants to pay the three several annual rents of 501., 301., and IU. 10s. 6d. Such an aggregate rental as this in the days of Queen Anne may well be conceived to represent a district of 664 acres, the extent of that now known by the name of Spital, in the township of Hodsock, and a few more acres of Spital land in the township of Blyth in addition thereto. And accordingly I arrive at the conclusion that the ancient landed possessions of the Hospital of St. John near Blyth amounted to very nearly, if not quite, 700 acres. Where are they now, the reader will naturally inquire. I will answer that question. The Cliftons most assuredly, if not the Cressys before them, took advantage of their position as patrons of the hospital, and effected for themselves long, nay almost interminable, leases of its lands. Sir Robert Clifton in 1740 sold to EdAvard Mellish, Esq. of Blyth his interest in the Spital, which well nigh amounted to that of the fee-simple of the estate, and in 1806 Lieut.-Col. Henry Francis Mellish sold the same, as parcel of the Blyth estate, to Joshua Walker, Esq., the grandfather of the present proprietor. * \" The Parliament at the same time put hospitals also into the king's possession. Yet, surely, more tender ness was used to hospitals, and I find very few of them finally suppressed.\" \u2014 Fuller, Ch. Hist. ii. 276."], [169, "151 THE HOSPITAL AND DISTRICT CALLED SPITAL. The district of Spital in Hodsock, containing 664 acres, pays a modus of 1-J. 18s. to the vicar of Blyth in lieu of vicarial tithes. I have some suspicion that this modus owes its origin to the bull of Pope Honorius in 1226. I have already considered the question whether the present parochial school-house of Blyth constituted a portion of the ancient hospital buildings. So late as 1703 Thomas Ousely was master or rector of the hospital. A portion of its property I find to have been a mansion called Blyth Spital, which was at various times the resi dence of persons of rank and station, as of Robert Clifton already mentioned. About 50 years ago this house was replaced by a gpod farm-house, at present occupied by Mr. Beevor, and the adjoining houses for the poor Avere demolished, and six almshouses built nearer to Blyth for six poor persons, who are appointed by the township of Blyth, and to each of whom the owner of the Spital pays 10s. yearly. Such is the skeleton to which the once ample and liberal endowment of the hospital of the Cressys has been reduced through the cupidity of man. Alas ! in relating its history I have been only relating the history of almost innumerable eleemosynary foundations of the same or similar nature throughout the kingdom \u2014 foundations which, if they had been fairly dealt with, might, through the increased value of land, have been expanded far beyond the contemplation of their founders, and, by an enlarged but legitimate interpretation of the spirit of their benefactions, rendered capable of providing not merely almshouses for the poor, but hospitals for the sick, and the consolations of religion for all \u2014 whether poor, sick, or dying. In a legal point of view no fault can be found with the present owner of the property. Doubtless his ancestor paid a full price for it, without any abatement on tho ground of a co-ordinate claim on the part of the poor; and there is no legal obligation upon him to do more than he does at the present moment. But if I was in his place I should be disposed to look, not merely at my present legal obligation, but at the past in all its bearings. And I should not be without hope that such calm and deliberate retrospect would lead him, as it might lead others after him, to make some moderate provision at least for the poor inmates of the Spital Almshouses. It is a blessed thing to have the poor in yearly pay, Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up Toward heaven, to call doAA'n blessings on us. Holm. Holm means low ground by the side of a river. This district of Hodsock runs up from the immediate neighbourhood of Nornay Bridge, by the side of the river Ryton, embracing all the meadows in front of Blyth Hall, and crosses the road from Blyth to Olcotes. Avicia de Tani, as we learn from the Blyth chartulary, in the presence and with the consent of her husband William de Clairfait, gave to the monks of Blyth, Holm, and all the lands belonging to it. This couple Avere, as I have already stated, founders of Hampole Nunnery before 1156, and, as we shall presently perceive, were benefactors of the abbey of Worksop William de Clairfait had by Avicia, an only daughter Sybil, Avho married Ralph dc Tilli, and by his second wife Albreda, the grand-daughter of Fulc de Lizours, was the progenitor of the Fitzwilliams."], [170, "152 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. Immediately before we cross the second bridge from Blyth to Olcotes, we observe on the right hand of the road, by the side of the river which runs from the latter place, a patch of black, loamy ground. Here stood the hamlet of Holme, consisting probably of not more than one respect able house and a few cottages. This was the residence of the Cressys of Holm, an offset doubtless of the Hodsock Cressys, and a fannly of consideration, as we find them appearing at the Heralds' Visitation in 1569. On a flat stone in the nave of Blyth church there is the following monumental inscription: \" Hie jacet sepulta Johanna Cresi uxor Francisci Cressi de Holme gen. sola filia et her: Will. Parke de Staniford defuncti gen. qu\u00e6 obiit primo die Maii afio dni 1588.\" Another resident here, Peter Cressy, the brother of Francis, made his will, proved 28 Aug. 1595, giving his soul to God Almighty his Creator and Redeemer, and his body to be buried in the parish church of Blyth, near unto his father Nicholas Cressy. In 1738 and 1740, Edward Mellish, Esq. of Blyth Hall, purchased of Sir Robert Clifton this district of Holm, comprising 266 acres, 1 rood, 19 perches. It was sold with the Blyth estate by Lieut.-Colonel Mellish to Joshua Walker, Esq., in 1806. It pays a modus of 7s. 6(7. to the vicar of Blyth in lieu of vicarial tithes. Hermeston. Goldthorp. Costrup. Woodhouse. Hodsock Park. Fleecethorp. I group these ancient districts together, inasmuch as they were all included in the sale by Sir Gervase Clifton to William Mellish, Esq. in 1765. The four first were shortly afterwards re-sold by Mr. Mellish to Ralph Knight, of Langold, Esq. Mr. Knight's descendant, the late Mr. Gaily Knight, of Firbeck, dying about 1845, bequeathed by will his Langold estate to Sir Thomas Wollaston White, Bart., of Wallingwells, who in 1847 sold portions thereof, viz. Hermeston, Goldthorp, Costrup, and Woodhouse, to Edward Chaloner, Esq., who, by a liberal and judicious investment of capital, has clothed this portion of the parish of Blyth with a very different and far more improved appearance than that which it used to wear. 1. Hermeston, the toAvn of the hermit, supposed to have occupied the position of Mr. Chaloner's present residence and adjoining cottages. But who was this anchorite? Was he some man of high station, Avho, like Jordan de Builli, already mentioned, had grown Aveary of the Avorld, but, unlike him, instead of entering a convent, had sought seclusion in solitude? or was he a person in a humbler walk of life? We are left to conjecture. For local tradition has presented not a vestige of his name or history. Here again we meet with William de Clairfait and Avicia his wife, who, about the middle of the twelfth century, gave to the abbey of St. Cuthbert of Worksop three bovates of land in Hermedeston, with the common of that town. Witnesses Robert de Lizours, Otto de Tilli, &c. (Regist. of Worksop, sol. 73.) 2. Costrup, the thorp of Cossard. The Cossards were tenants of Fulc de Lizours.

Ralph Cossard, 6th Richard I. joined Earl John against his sovereign, and forfeited his estates. In the following year he paid a fine, and had re-seisin.

It was recently in the occupation chiefly of Mr. John Radley, and in a field not far from the farm-house may be seen mounds, probably of buildings and fish-ponds, marking the old residence of the Cossards. A field in the same locality is known still by the name of the Priest's Croft, a parcel of the ancient endowment of the chapel. 3. Hodsock Park, the property of John Joseph ShuttlcAvorth, Esq. and consisting of about 250 acres. The Rev.

The latter portion is occupied by Mr. Cross and Mr. Coupe, whose house stands on the old site of Fleecethorp. The Rectorial and Vicarial Tithes of the Toavnship of Hodsock. The rectorial tithes of this large township, which comprises as I have said 4,110a. of land, are commuted for a rent-charge of 950^.; the vicarial for a rent-charge of 2Al. This striking disproportion between the two is to be accounted for partly by the moduses upon Spital, Holm, and Costrup, already enumerated; but it receives its full explanation in the Monster Modus of Great Hodsock, bv virtue of which the vicar of Blyth receives the sum of 9s. Ad. in lieu of all vicarial tithes of 2,252 acres of land. A modus decimandi, commonly designated by the shorter appellation of modus, is a particular manner of tithing different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, and generally consists of a pecuniary redemption or composition. To render a money district modus valid in law the following conditions are essential. ( 1 ) That it shall reach back to the commencement of the \u00e6ra of legal memory, namely, the reign of Richard I. (2) That it shall be invariable in amount. (3) That it shall cover a district precisely of the same extent from age to age, the metes and boundaries whereof can be distinctly defined.

Now, at the very outset, there is one reflection which very forcibly suggests itself to my mind, and it is this \u2014 that even if all these conditions could be satisfied with the most rigorous demonstra tion, as they never have been, still a great fraud and injury would be inflicted upon any benefice by setting up a very insignificant and disproportionate money payment, simply because it is an ancient one, in bar of tithes in kind or of their just equivalent in money according to the prices of the present day. It is no more right or just for the modern tithe-payer to demand exemp tion from payment of tithe on tender of one-fifth part of a farthing per acre, merely because his predecessors on the same lands a century ago paid that sum, than it would be right or just for the modern rent-payer to expect that his landlord would be satisfied with 6d. per acre rent, because his predecessors on the same farm a hundred years ago paid no more. If it is equitable to offer the tithe-owner one-fifth part of a farthing per acre for tithe, it is quite as equitable to offer the land lord 6d. per acre, and even less, for rent. And it is quite possible that the day may come which shall witness the elevation into a principle of law of a modus reddendi, as well as a modus decimandi. I have known landlords who appeared to me to be accelerating, whether consciously or uncon sciously I care not to inquire, such a consummation. But then I shall be told such is the law of the land. I admit it : and further I regret to add, that, in the administration of the law in our courts of justice, there has been evinced at all times a far too great readiness to infer the existence of the conditions of a legally valid modus already enumerated. If the champions of a modus could only produce parochial terriers reaching back for even a century, into which interested land-"], [173, "155 MOXSTER MODUS OF GREAT nODSOCK. lords had contrived to thrust the Avord modus or composition , our courts and juries would by a wonderfully rapid induction infer that such modus had existed since the time of Richard I., unless the incumbent could achieve the almost impossible task of proving a negative. Whereas by just the very reverse process the courts and juries should haAre declared, A rector at common law, and a vicar by the terms of his endowment, are entitled to tithes, and the onus probandi rests upon you landowners, and it is for you to prove rigorously to our satisfaction that your modus is co-eval with the commencement of legal memory, otherwise it must fall to the ground. My lamented predecessor, the Rev. John Rudd, filed a Bill in the Exchequer for the. recovery of vicarial tithes in this district of Great Hodsock, as well as in the districts of Holm and Spital \u2014 \u25a0 the value of such tithes in the whole township being at least 250/. a year. A decree was given against him in the three instances; an issue was demanded to try the validity of the Great Hodsock modus of 9s. Ad., and the case was tried before the late Mr. Justice Littledale and a special jury at Nottingham in the summer of 1831.* The principal supporters of the modus, Mrs. Ann Chambers of Hodsock, and Mr. George Savile Foljambe of Osberton, who also were most interested in its maintenance, produced a scries of terriers and receipts, the former commencing in 1714 and the latter in 1740, as Avell as witnesses who professed to identify the precise metes and boundaries of Great Ilodsock.f To rebut this evidence the vicar produced the deed of endowment of the vicarage in the year 1287. This was a very important document. It was draAvn up at the palace of the Archbishop of York, the chief ordinary, at Scrooby, and received his sanction, as well as that of the Prior and Convent of Blyth, the patrons of the living: and it Avas not a century posterior to the commence ment of legal memory. This authentic instrument very minutely describes the tithes and payments with which the vicarage of Blyth was endowed; but it contains not one sydable about a modus in Great Hodsock or any where else. Equally silent upon the subject of any modus is a subsequent confirmation of the vicar's rights made in 1346, with the concurrence again of the patrons and ordinary. In addition, the vicar proved that in one part at least of this district vicarial tithes, or an equivalent, had been rendered during the time of his predecessor. And it was further proved, if indeed a fact so perfectly notorious required any proof, that the 2,252 acres of the district named Great Hodsock, which were alleged to have been distinctly inclosed within fence and boundary since the reign of Richard I., had in point of fact been an uninclosed and in a very great measure an uncultivated tract of country so late as sixty or seventy years before the trial. Notwithstanding all this, and notwithstanding some exceedingly strong remarks in the judge's * Mr. Rudd recovered the vicarial tithes of Hodsock Mill Close, Butler's Carr, and Wilson's Close. \u2022f The stones which were erected after the trial to mark the supposed boundaries of Great Hodsock are now beginning to fall. Considering the great good which the proprietors reaped from this boundary question, I think that they ought to place the stones upon a firm foundation, as so many monuments of their victory. Why nut convert them into altars to the god Terminus, and engrave these lines upon them ? \u2014 Conveniunt, celebrantque dapes vicinia simplex Et cantant laudes, Termine sancte, tuas.

I know not who constituted the jury who returned this marvellously credulous verdict; and therefore I can be actuated by no personal feeling in what I am about to say. Probably at no time when contesting the validity of a modus, unless his evidence was overpowering, could a clergyman have the slightest chance of obtaining a verdict at the hands of a jury, and for obvious reasons. Most assuredly at the period of this trial at Nottingham his chance was infinitesimally small. For Radical candidates on the hustings, Radical neAvspapers, and Radical ministers too, were then, for the purpose of catching auram popularem, perpetually inveighing against the in iquity of tithes and the bloated wealth of the Church, and there can be no doubt that these \" fierce and turbulent \" demagogues made an impression upon the mind of the country at large. In proof of which I will mention one fact which came very distinctly under my own cognisance. A tithe suit to upset a modus was tried at Durham, at Avhich I was present. The jury was a special one, and one of the jurymen on entering the court declared to a friend of mine, who repeated the declaration in my hearing, \" I will give it against the clergyman whatever be the evidence.\" Fortunately the foreman of the jury was an intelligent and conscientious man, and he returned the verdict, which doubtless he had greatly influenced, \" We find for [ ] the vicar, in consequence of his documentary evidence.\" Yes; but it Avas documentary evidence chiefly collected by one, who is now at rest, to whose deeply cherished memory I have dedicated this volume, and whose knowledge upon this, as indeed upon all subjects connected with historical and ecclesiastical an tiquities, was of the most varied, extensive, and accurate character. Some of my readers may probably desire to knoAv how and when in my opinion this so-called modus of 9s. Ad., as well as those upon the Holm and Costrup districts, took their origin. In the year 1714 then, when the mention of these moduses first occurs, the Cliftons were owners of the districts just named, as well as of considerable property besides, in the parish of Blyth, and of course possessed paramount influence. They were at that period the authors of these compo sitions for vicarial tithes, which in the then existing state of cultivation of the country were probably of little value :* and they intruded into the parochial terriers that word modus or composition, which hereafter was to be a weapon against the vicar, brought out of his own armoury. Meanwhile observe how they protected their own interests. They Avere lessees under Trinity College of the great tithes; they resided very frequently at Hodsock, and they took care to draw their own tithes in kind, or receive an adequate equivalent, according to valuation, from year to year for them. And thus it comes to pass that at this day the rectorial tithes suffer no diminution what ever by modus, whilst the vicarial are cut down to 24?. per annum. I hesitate not to say, that, if the authorities of the College at that day had exercised, as they were in duty bound to do, a vigilant supervision of their benefices, the Vicarage of Blyth Avould never have suffered as it has done, and the vicar himself would have been enabled to * These and similar compositions were really in the first instance in general rents ; and, if this idea had been carefully borne in mind and acted upon, we should hardly have had a single modus in the kingdom."], [175, "157 MONSTER MODUS OF GREAT HODSOCK. promote the accomplishment of many useful and beneficent objects, in which, on simple grounds of prudence, he is now precluded from embarking. The Legislature, through an Act commonly known as Lord Tenterdcn's Act, have now forbidden suits for the recovery of tithes screened by modus. By that statute no proceedings can be taken for a period beyond 60 years, or three incumbencies, unless instituted before its en actment. One is tempted to say of those, some of them still living and in high authority in the Church, who were chiefly instrumental in passing that Act, \" Solitudinem faciunt et pacem appellant.\" The so/itudo however falls to the lot of the tithe-owner ; the tithe-payer reaps the benefit of the pax ; and it is all the more incumbent upon him to turn his unenviable gains to a good purpose, and thus to obtain peace from a higher than human power, by contributing largely and liberally towards the exigencies of the Church and the requirements of charity.

These two toAvnships are for various civil purposes incorporated in one, and the manor is styled the Manor of Styrrup, otherwise Styrrup Olcotes, otherwise Styrrup-cum- Olcotes. It will, therefore, be convenient that in an historical point of view they thould to a certain extent be taken together, and when necessity demands be treated separately. The first-named township is at the present day written generally Oldcoats ; about two centuries ago we find it occasionally designated Dulecotes. Ancient charters never present it in either of these forms, but as Oulecotes or Olecotes, and the Pipe Rolls of John and Henry III. as Ulecote, Ulcote, Ulecot, Wlecot, Hulecote. It was probably a local designation of old cottages, and was coined after Domesday Survey, as it does not occur there. Names of similar formation in the county of Nottingham are Bevercotes and Bulcote, and of similar import probably Hullcott, in the county of Buckingham, and Hulcote manor, in the county of Northampton. But there is another explanation of the name which may possibly commend itself to the etymologist. Hull is a very old English word, and is equivalent to sty \u2014 the place for keeping swine. In early days, when these animals were so very extensively fed upon the acorns of our large wooded districts, there is nothing extravagant in the supposition that the places where they were collected together should frequently have derived their names from them, and grown into local designations. And this a priori hypothesis is converted into certainty by reference to such names as SAvinburn, Swindon, Swindell, Sugden, Sowerby, Swinnerton, and others. Dr. Leo observes, \" that an estate is hardly registered as complete in the Anglo-Saxon charters without including one or more hog woods.\" The addition of cote or cotes at the end of the name Olcotes forms no fatal objection to this etymology, inasmuch as a second Avord is perpetually added to explain the first in our local names \u2014 e.g. in Skelbrook, Skel meaning precisely what brook means, and again in our own district in Blyth LaAV Hill, where the second word Hill is simply a repetition of Laiv, which is of equivalent import; and at a more remote distance from us, in Lancashire, in the name of Pendle Hill, Avhere hill has been added in explanation, or perhaps in ignorance of the aboriginal Pen, Avhich has the same signification, and which we find in Penrith, Penrhyn, and in the Pennine and Apennine mountains. In Estirape, Leuing, Torchil, and Leuric had seven bovates to be taxed to the Dane-gelt. The land consisted of four carucates. Bernard, the vassal of Roger, noAv has one carucate, nine sochmen, seven villeins on the demesnes, and five board-men having three carucates and a half. There are six acres of meadow and ten of pasturable wood. Valued in time of King Edward at 50s., now at 25s. Styrrup would present an insoluble mystery, Avere it not for the extract just given from the Domesday Survey. It is there written Estirape, the eastern division (rape). If this is the true"], [177, "THE MANOR OF OLCOTES AND STYRRUP. 159 derivation of the Avoid we are carried back to an exceedingly early period; and it is singular that the two words rape and trithing (riding) should be found in such close proximity to each other, for the village of Styrrup is on the very borders of the Avest riding of York. The Manor of Olcotes and Styrrup. I will give in limine an outline of the history of this manor, filling up subsequently the details. I., then: Roger de Builli is tenant in capite of the manor, being parcel of the possessions of the honour of Tickhill. II. He subinfeuds Fulc de Lizours, whose descendants down to the time of John the Constable of Chester hold the manor, which about the year 1100 is resumed among other possessions of the honour by the Crown, and remains in its hands with such exceptions as have been noticed in a preceding chapter. III. ToAvards the close of the twelfth century appears a family, De Stirap. They had probably been tenants under the house of Lizours, but now begin to occupy the chief position in the lordship down to the time of Ingeram de Olcotes, who about 1274 conveyed it to Roger Darcy. IV. Before the year 1310 the tenancy of the manor passed from the Darcys to the Cressys, and continued, Avith some interruption hereafter to be noticed, in their hands for several generations. V. In the time of Henry VIII., if not before, the manor of Styrrup and Olcotes was not separately leased, but Avas included in the Bailiwick of BassetlaAv, the lessees of which, under the duchy of Lancaster, stand from that time as follows: \u2014 25th May, 22 Henry VIII. By indenture of lease of this date the King demised to Humphry Fitz William, Gent., the Bailiwick of BassetlaAv for term of forty years. 18th May, 11 Elizabeth. New lease of the said Bailiwick to Charles FitzWilliam, Gent. Hilary Term, 26 Elizabeth. New lease to Charles Fitzwilliam. 26th July, 1689.

NeAv lease of the said Bailiwick to John Duke of NeAvcastle for sixty-four years, or three lives. 6th August, 3 George I. New lease of the said Bailiwick to Thomas Holies, Duke of New castle, Marquis and Earl of Clare. 29th June, 1749. New lease to the same. 10th May, 1768. New lease to Henry Earl of Lincoln VI. The Newcastle family retained their interest in the manor till the commencement of the present century. In 1806 Viscount Gahvay became lessee of this lordship, which Avas then probably detached from the bailiwick of Bassetlaw, and the Moncktons still hold it by lease under the duchy. It Avould appear that in times past the Cliftons and Mellishes were sub-lessees."], [178, "160 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH.

Fulc de Lizours Avas the brother of Torald, of whom I have spoken under Hodsock, and was a witness to the charter of foundation of the Convent of Blyth, a.d. 1088. From the tenant in capite, Roger de Builli, he received a grant of the manors of Sprotborough, Billingley, &c. in the West Riding of York, and of lands at Hodsock, Olcotes, Styrrup, Harworth, Cotham, Eaton, Clumber, Marnham, Weston, Clayworth, and Clarborough, in the county of Nottingham, as well as at Risley and Breaston, in the county of Derby. He was living in the early part of the reign of Henry I., for in the treasury of the Dean and Chapter of Durham there is a charter of that king, confirming the grants to the convent of Durham in Nottinghamshire made by the Conqueror, and especially two carucates, for which they paid de jure an annual acknowledgment of four shillings to Lizours. He had exacted more, and was commanded to refund the difference. The above table shows that his descendants connected themselves by marriage with the noble houses of Laci, the Lords of Pontefract Castle, and of Fitz-Eustace, Barons of Halton and hereditary Constables of Chester, and that from him, by the female side, springs the noble family of Fitzwilliam. Fulc Lizours was a considerable benefactor to the monks of Blyth, having given them half of the Add of Billingley, and all his land in Curtingestoc (Costock) ; as well as four bovates in Olcotes, four in Styrrup, two in Marton (Martin), two in Blyth, and two in Hodsock. He also gave them a place in Sarlecroft to make a mill, the multure of the mill of Harworth with the appertaining soc, and a load of wood daily from Bdhagh, the tenth penny of his Nottinghamshire rents, the tithe of his pigs and of his malt, and one acresset (as much seed as would sow an acre) of wheat, rye or oats from Sceby (qu.? Skegby), Plumtre, Harworth, and from every plough in his demesne. These donations were confirmed by his son Robert, and subsequently by Albreda, daughter of Robert, with the consent of William Fitzgodric her husband, and by her son John the Constable of Chester, who added of his own gift a load of broom daily from Bilhagh. And now there comes before us another ancient family, between which and that of Lizours I have already stated the nature of the connection which probably existed. For the better illustration of my subject I have recourse again to a tabular form."], [179, "161 PHILIP OF OLCOTES. Gerard de Stirap.^Matilda. r \u25a0 1 ' 1 T 1 1 .!

This family were lords of the manor of Olcotes with Styrrup, and in their day must have enjoyed considerable influence and distinction, for Philip of Olcotes, as Ave shall see, rose gradually to public offices of great power and eminence, and Ingeram of Olcotes conferred the manor of his ancestors, with considerable estates in Olcotes and Styrrup, upon no less a person than Roger Darcy. To commence then with the religious history of this family first, \u2014 I have to state that Gerard de Stirap bestowed upon the monastery of St. Mary of Blyth his Avood Northlund for the annual rent of 3s., and three acres of land in his meadow in Loc. His wife Matilda gave the monks all the land which Roger the porter held under her in Blyth, and which she had purchased of Hamelin of Bugethorp. Their son Philip forgave them the above rent, and added thereto four acres of land between Northlund and Litelewadhil. These donations were confirmed by Ingeram and Norman. Alured of Barnby granted to the same religious house all the land which belonged to Serl, or Serlo, of Olcotes, both in and out of the village, and two and a half acres of meadow in his demesne in the meadow of Loc, beginning from a spot which is called Knavecastel, and going southwards. His Avidow confirmed these gifts, and was compelled to add to her charter words which indicated, I fear, that the religious entertained grave suspicions of her veracity. \" Et ut h\u00e6c mea concessio et donatio rata sit et stabilis et firnia, subjeci me jurisdiction! Abbatis de Rupe et Prioris de Wirkeshop, quod, si contra hoc scriptum venire vel contradicere pr\u00e6sumpserim, habeant potestatem me ab introitu ecclesi\u00e6 suspendendi et omni appellatione et exceptione remota a com munione fidelium privandi. Et ne hoc scriptum meum possit irritari, ipsum coram pr\u00e6dictis Abbate et Priorc me fideliter observaturam juravi et id sigilli mei munimine roboravi.\" The same family were benefactors of the Abbot and Canons of Welbeck. But it is chiefly through the civil history of PniLip of Olcotes that they have attained prominence. This eminent person on his entrance upon the stage of active life in the troubled reign of Richard I., took up arms with Earl John against his sovereign ; and doubtless was one of those who defended the castle of Tickhill for John, when Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, besieged it on behalf of the King. In the first year of John's reign he allied himself in marriage with Joanna, daughter and co-heir of Robert de Mesnil (Meyncll), of the ancient Northern family of Meynell. Sewal Fitz-Henry, called in the Pipe Rolls Sewal Scrviens, had married her sister, and intended Joanna for his own nephew, to which arrangement he had obtained the royal sanction. The result was that Philip was fined 100/. and a war-horse, part of which fine Avas subsequently remitted. In the 5th of John he was actively engaged in the king's r"], [180, "162 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. service, and Avas appointed Constable of Chinon in Touraine. Being taken prisoner in battle, the king gave him 200 marcs for his ransom \u2014 a sum sufficiently large to prove the high estimation in which he was held both by his royal master and by his enemies. In 1208 Aimericus archdeacon of Durham, and others, as executors of the will of Philip de Pictavia, late bishop of that see, rendered account of \"two thousand marcs, and of all the jewels which had belonged to the bishop, on account of the debt due from him to the kinsr, and of his G I ' G' liabilities (pro misericordiis in quibus ipse episcopus fu'erat), and of the excesses of his parents fbr which they had been arrested.\" At the same time the Prior of Durham gave account of 500 marcs and 7 palfreys for himself and his vassals, for the enjoyment of their liberties as in the time of the late bishop. Partly from the hostility existing between John and the Pope, and partly from other causes, the see was vacant, and continued so for nine years, during which the king received the temporal revenues through the hands of the archdeacon Aimeric and of Philip of Olcotes, whom he had appointed custodes of the bishoprick. To them the prior handed over the money and the palfties. In 1214 the shrievalty of Northumberland was committed to him in conjunction with his friend the archdeacon, which office he subsequently held alone for the remainder of this reign, and the first four years of that of Henry III. About the same time he Avas invested with the offices of Forester of Northumberland and Constable of Barnborough Castle, and received a grant of the manors of Nafferton, Matfen, and Lorbottle, together Avith some houses in Newcastle-on-Tyne. In 1216 he and Hugh de Baliol were constituted governors of all the country to the north of the Tees, and stoutly defended the Northern fortresses for King John against the inroads of the King of Scotland, on behalf of Prince Lewis of France. The preservation of the North of England to John, after the barons of Northumberland had sworn allegiance to Alexander of Scotland, Avas undoubtedly due to the energy of Philip of Olcotes. Soon after the accession of Henry III. he Avas summoned to court, and Walter Grev arch bishop of York was commanded to afford him sale conduct thither. Amongst the royal and other letters in the Wakefield Toavci* of the Tower of London, is an exceedingly curious and interesting one from the archbishop to the king, the purport of which is, that on Tuesday before the Feast of St. Mark the Evangelist he received his sovereign's letter at Hexham, commanding him to conduct Philip de Ulecot to court. The dav following he had found it necessary to stay at Hexham in order to be present at the Feast of St. Wilfrid, the patron saint of the church there. On Thursday he had proceeded with all haste towards Nottinghamshire, expecting to find Philip there, but on his Avay a messenger informed him that Philip had gone to the North, and that, the holding of a council having been fixed for the quinzaine of Pentecost, he objected to come to court to wait until that time. By a subsequent message from his clerks and mes sengers he signified his readiness to attend the council, if he had a safe and secure conduct. We gather from this singular document the relations existing between Philip and the court. All-powerful as he Avas in the North, he did not choose to trust himself without a sale conduct in the hands of the king or his aihdsers. Shortly after this some quarrel arose between Philip of Olcotes and Roger Bertram. Amongst the collection of letters in the Tower of London already referred to, is one from Philip to Hubert de Burgh the Justiciary, explanatory of this transaction ; from which it appears that the former is restrained from giving up Mitfbrd Castle to its oAvner Bertram by Hugh Baliol, until his"], [181, "163 PHILIP OF OLCOTES. own rights in the manor of Mere, which is held by the Earl of Salisbury, arc restored to him. Philip and Bertram were both summoned before the council, and the Sheriff of Nottingham Avas commanded to seize the lands of the former if he did not surrender the castle of Mitford to the latter, according to the king's repeated injunctions. He soon regained the royal favour, for in the next month the manors of Corbridge in Northumberland, and Seaton, near Seaham in the countv of Durham, Avere assigned for his support whilst in the king's service. In a letter remaining in the abovenamed collection Philip complains to Henry III. that the Bishop of Durham (Richard de Marisco) had seized his lands and houses in the bishoprick, and ill-treated and im prisoned his servants ; and he makes his petition for redress of this outrage against himself, his sovereign, and the peace of the kingdom. In 1219 he Avas one of the justices itinerant in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lanca shire, and in the next year was made seneschal of Poictou and Gascony, taking in his train a numerous array of knights, among whom Galfri'l I Jressy was one. In this service he died, and the king, in a mandate dated November 2, 1220, announcing his death to the sheriff of Northumber land, styles him \"dominus tuus,\" from which we may infer that he had retained in his absence some influential post in the North. The Convent of Blyth, as they watched the career of this eminent man, mav well be supposed to have indulged in feelings of natural pride and exultation at the thought that they had so great a name as his enrolled, inter memores fastos, with those of then* other pious benefactors. And even at this day, when viewing him through the long avenue of bygone history, a peculiar interest and sympathy must, among ourselves at all events in this parish, attach to him, when we reflect that, powerful and eminent and energetic as he was, both in peace and war, he was bred in our own soil, was familiar with our own country, and frequently knelt in prayer in the same venerable and time-honoured sanctuary in which we ourselves at this very day are permitted to kneel. The personal and domestic history of so distinguished a man as Philip of Olcotes possesses a peculiar interest, especially for those who have anv associations with the spot from which he derived his name. And we are naturally induced to inquire whether anv vestiges of his mansion at Olcotes still remain. I have to observe, then, that a few years ago there stood at the entrance of the village from Blyth an ancient house called the Manor House, now replaced by a very hand some and excellent residence, the property of Edward Chaloner, Esq., in front of which, in a field which is still known by the name of the Manor Yard, extensive mounds imlicating the foundations of buildings may still be traced. Here, then, I should be disposed to six the residence of Philip of Olcotes in his early days, and whenever in subsequent years he visited his native county. I have only to add, that his widow married, not long after his death, Oliver de Albini, and a\u00ab*ain, four years afterwards, Walter de Godervil. With respect to his property at Olcotes ami Styrrup, as he died without issue, this descended to his five sisters above named, the second of whom, Margaret, married Hamelin de Bugethorp. Their grandson, Ingeram de Olcotes, about 1274, conferred the manor of Olcotes with lands there, as avcII as at Styrrup and Blyth, upon Roger Darcy, on condition that he obtained for him the honour of knighthood, and provided for him and three of his men maintenance and clothing for his life. Roger Darcy belonged to a noble ami splendid house. The name of Norman de Arecy occurs in the roll of Battle Abbey, and Avhen the Domesday Survey was taken he was found seized of T 2"], [182, "164 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. thirty-three manors in Lincolnshire, of which Nocton was one, where the family settled for many generations, and where his son Robert founded a priory of Austin Canons. A descendant of this Norman, namely, Philip Darcy, married, temp. Henry IIL, Isabel, second daughter of Ralph Bertram of Mitford Castle, in Northumberland, and by her had five sons, Norman, Thomas, Roger, Ralph, and Robert. Of these, Norman and Roger fought at the battle of Evesham, in 1265, against the King; but in the following year, by virtue of a general pacification of the king dom, were pardoned, John de Burgh of Kent, Adam de Newmarch of Yorkshire, and Robert de UfFord of Norfolk being sureties for their future loyalty. This was the Roger Darcy who received from Ingeram de Olcotes the manor of Olcotes about 1274, as above stated. I have a strong impression that some common ties of blood or affinity existed between these two men. The very gift is prima facie evidence of such; and, in confirmation of my supposition, I would observe, that many years after Roger's time one of his family, John Lord Darcy, obtained the licence of Edward III. (16 Edward III.) to marry Alice, the widow of Nicholas Meynell, for Philip of Olcotes had married a lady of this family, and I think it probable that earlier marriages still than that which I have above mentioned between the Darcys and the Meynells may have formed a connecting link of sympathy between Ingeram of Olcotes and Roger Darcy. It is further worthy of remark, that Darcy 's mother was a Northumberland lady; that the Darcys had estates at Belford, Lowick, Wooler, and \"the great waste of Cheviock,\" all in the same county, whilst the heirs of Philip of Olcotes retained the estates which he himself had possessed there. Be this as it may, Roger Darcy now became \"lord of Olcotes.\" So he expressly styles himself in a charter to the monks of Blyth, in which he cedes to them the right of common pasture in the fields of Styrrup and Olcotes, without opposition on the part of himself or his heirs. The Darcys did not long retain their property here, but conveyed it with the manor to the Cressys, one of whom, Hugh Cressy, in 1310, settled it on Robert Russell of Tickhill and Cecily his wife, and their heirs. In 1414 Edmund Russell, the grandson of Robert, re-settled it on John Cressy of Olcotes, whose descendants resided here for many generations, and took a respectable position amongst the gentry of the county, appearing at the Heralds' Visitations as early as in 1480, and again in 1555.* The subsequent history of the lordship has been traced in a preceding part of the Chapter. At the time of the inclosure, in 1802, of the open fields, meadows, pastures, commons, and waste grounds within the townships of Styrrup, Olcotes, Farworth, and so much of Nornay as is within the liberty of Styrrup, in the parishes of Blyth and Harworth, an adverse claim to this manor, as against the Crown, was set up by James Littlewood and John Littlewood his brother ; but, after hearing and examining the evidence and arguments on both sides, the counsel and solicitor of the Littlewoods relinquished their claim. By the Commissioners under this Act of Inclosure it was found that the open fields, meadows, and pastures of the above-named liberties contained 784a. 3r. 13p., the commons and waste * Their arms were the same as those of the Cressys of Hodsock, A lion rampant double-queue sable, but with a distinct crest, which they appear to have been very anxious to have carefully registered in the Visitations, \" as confirmed by William Flower, Norroy King of Armes, to Henery Cressy, of Oulcottes, in com.

Diverse allotments, amounting in all to about 40 acres, were awarded to the King in right of his Duchy of Lancaster, as lord of the manor \u2014 the same being so much and such parts of the several commons and waste grounds as were equal in value to one-eighteenth part thereof \u2014 for his right in the soil. They further allotted to the Crown about 1 2 acres on Whitewater common in lieu of the right of common. The preponderating proportion of open and waste to inclosed ground which the preceding figures disclose must have given to this district of North Nottinghamshire a wild and desolate appearance. But in nearly every township around us the land wore a similar aspect at the com mencement of the present century; and so far from regretting, we may rather congratulate ourselves, that the extensive and uninclosed and uncultivated commons and wastes of other days have given place to fenced and cultivated fields. It is only when the spurious economy of a restless age sends the commissioners into our village greens, for the purpose of inclosing and aAvarding to the opulent the prescriptive estate of the poor, on which many a noble heart, and many a vigorous intellect, have developed and strengthened those poAvers by which in after-life they were to do the state some service \u2014 it is only then that there is but too just occasion for regret. But in these days utilitarianism is a great fact ; it is probably great in other ways. OLCOTES. The land in this township has been in the hands of various small proprietors untd the last few years, during which Mr. EdAvard Chaloner has by different purchases formed an estate of consider able extent and value, and, as at Hodsock, by a liberal and judicious investment of capital in the improvement of his property, has both provided employment for the labourer and greatly improved the tone and character of the village and land around it. In 1836 the Rev. William Downes, vicar of Harworth, founded a school in the village, and established divine service in the school-room on Sunday evenings, which has been continued by his successor. And noAv, before I proceed to Styrrup, let me for one moment direct the attention of my readers in this district to the local names of Loc, Northlund, and Knavecastel, and to the personal name of Serl, or Serlo, which occur in the ancient charters cited at the beginning of this chapter. Loc is clearly the root of our present Loxdale, and is an old Saxon word signifying an inclosure.* Lund Avas found among our Barnby-Moor charters as entering into the composition of Ravelund ; it still lingers in our Lound-bridge, and in the name of a hamlet in the parish of Sutton, hence called Sutton-on-Lound. It signifies a low, still, place, sheltered from the wind; and in a some what varied, but essentially the same, idea, in the old language of the North of England, is applied to a tranquil night \u2014 a lound night. Knavecastel, a fragment of Avhich still survives in some pastures called the Castle-roses, was a common budding for the convenience of the knaves, or poor house-holders, who probably had the privilege of turning their cattle upon some open common here. Knavcsborough, noAv Knaresborough, and Knavcs-mire, near York, arc to be similarly explained. The personal name of Serl gives its designation to Serlby, the hamlet of Serl. * Loc, Locc, clausura, claustrum, septum quodvis. Lye, Sax. Diet."], [184, "166 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. STYRRUP. In the reign of Henry VI. appears, for the first time in connection with this township, no less a name than that of Talbot. John Talbot, the eminent person to whom I refer, was the son of John Talbot first earl of Shrewsbury, by his wife Matilda, daughter and co-heir of Thomas Neville jure uxoris Lord Furnival (brother of Ralph Neville earl of Westmerland) by his Avife Joanna Lady Furnival. I cannot resist the temptation of going a little deeper into the history of this distinguished house of Talbot. And therefore I shall commence by stating in a very summary manner that in the reign of Henry I. William de Lovetot was, by gift of that king, lord of the manor of Sheffield and Hallamshire, as well as of Worksop and various other places in this county. At Worksop, where he had a mansion, about A.D. 1104 he founded a priory of Austin Canons, which was dedi cated to St. Cuthbert, the patron saint of Durham, and considerable portions of the church of which still happily remain, constituting one of the great ecclesiastical features of the Midland Counties.* Matilda, an heiress of this tamily of Lovetot, was given in marriage by Richard I. to Gerard de Furnival, of Norman extraction. The succeeding generations Avhich issued from this union between the houses of Lovetot and Furnival shine resplendent like a perfect galaxy of nobility, allying themsefves Avith the powerful families of Warwick, Salisbury, Montague, Neville, Ormond, Stafford, Hastings, Dacre of Gilsland, Rutland, Cavendish, Arundel, Lennox, and finally rising to the restored dukedom of Norfolk, in the person of Thomas Lord Arundel, in 1664. John Talbot, afterwards first Earl of Shrewsbury, was summoned to Parliament in 1410 as Lord Furnival. In 1412 he was made Lord Justice of Ireland; in 1414 Lord Lieutenant. He dis tinguished himself greatly in the French wars under Henry V. In 1424 he was created Knight of the Garter; and again was actively engaged in the Avars with France, being made general of the English army there in 1428. It Avas at this time that he was taken prisoner by the Maid of Orleans at the battle of Patay, but was exchanged for a French officer. In consideration of his eminent services he was created in 1442 Earl of Shrewsbury, and subsequently resumed the lord lieutenancy of Ireland. In 1453, at the siege of Chastillon, the Earl, then in his eightieth year, Avas mortally wounded. John, the second Earl of Shrewsbury, was forty years of age at the death of his father. In 1442 he served under him in France. Four years afterwards he was made Lord Treasurer of Ireland, and in 1457 Lord Treasurer of England. On the 19th December, 1459, in reward of his services, he received from the King a grant of 100 marcs yearly out of the manor of Wakefield. He was killed at the battle of Northampton, July 10, 1460, fighting on the side of the house of Lancaster, and was buried in the priory church of Worksop. j * It was in this very year, 1104, that the body of Saint Cuthbert was removed into the cathedral of Durham. Perhaps the great reputation of the Northern saint had spread over England and induced Lovetot to dedicate his church to him. The effigy of the saint, with the usual accompaniment of the head of Oswald king of Northumbria on his arm, is carved upon the abbey gateway. t The following was the inscription upon his tomb : \" Sepulchruin magnanimi atque pr\u00e6potentis Domini, Domini Joannis de Talbot, Comitis Salopi\u00e6 Secundi, ex Regio sanguine ducentis originem. Qui Henrico Regi fidissimus bello apud MNorthamptoniam gesto, ante signa strenue pugnans, honesta morte occidit die decimo Julii, Anno Domini nostri Iesu Christi, 1460. Cujus anim\u00e6 propitietur Deus. Amen.\""], [185, "167 RECTORIAL AND VICARIAL TITHES OF STYRRUP AND OLCOTES. And now to return to Styrrup. This last-named person Avas the John Talbot who in 1445 purchased a considerable estate there and elsewhere. The deed of conveyance is interesting, and therefore I shall venture to submit to my readers a copious extract from it. \" This is the final agreement made in the court of our lord the king at Westminster, in the octaves of the Holy Trinity, in the 23d year of the reign of Henry VI., king of England and France, before Richard Newton, Thomas Fulthorp, William Ayscogh, John Portyngton, and Nicholas Ayssheton, justices, and other faithful subjects of our lord the king then present, Between Sir John Talbot, son and heir of John Earl of Salop, Roger Stedeman, clerk, John Barnby, John Kersford, and William Swvft, plaintiffs, and John Mathewe of Blithe and Agnes his wife, deforciants, concerning the manor of Styrop with its appurtenances, and two messuages, eight tofts, one hundred and thirty acres of land, forty acres of meadow, six acres of wood, fifty-three shillings and eight pence of rent, and the rent of one pound of pepper and one pound of cumin, with the appurtenances, in Styrop, Owlecotes, StaArnton, Ferwath, Plumtre, and Barnby; and concerning the fishpond of Southmore, as also the mediety of a mill with its appurtenances in the aforesaid vill of Owlecotes. Whence plea of cotwention was taken between them in the same court, to wit, that the aforesaul John Mathewe and Agnes acknowledge the aforesaid manor, tenements, &c. to be the property of John Talbot, as estates which the said John, Roger, &c. hold of the gift of the said John Mathewe and Agnes.\" They further quit-claim and warrant in consideration of 200 marcs of silver. This estate descended to the posterity of John Talbot down to the time of Charles HoAvard, tenth of eleventh Duke of Norfolk, for both these noblemen bore the same name in the last century, when it was sjjIjI under die authority of an Act of Parliament. At that period the trustees of the Hospital founded at Sheffield by Gilbert Earl of Shrewsbury in 1616 were pos sessed of land and houses at and near Belper, of which property Mr. Strutt, the founder of the present family of that name, was anxious to obtain possession. As the trustees had no power to alienate except by exchange, and as Mr. Strutt had nothing to offer Avhich would meet their views, he purchased the Styrrup property of the Duke of Norfolk, and with it effected an exchange for the Belper estate of the charity, which at that time was regarded as beneficial to the hospital, although the result has proved otherwise. This estate of the Hospital, Avith the additions made to it at the time of the inclosure, constitutes a large farm, and at present is let to Mr. Woodcock of Styrrup, who occupies a sub stantial farm-house, which is known by the name of John of Gaunt's Manor-house, doubtless from the circumstance of this great man haAring been lord of the honour of Tickhill, of which Styrrup was a member, and probably having had a grange here upon his demesnes \u2014 the village of Styrrup being only about tAvo miles distant from Tickhill Castle.

Winter, the cottages near it, and the mill, anil a few more cottages at the south-west of the hamlet, are in the same parish."], [186, "168 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. The remaining portions of both villages are in the parish of Harworth. With regard to the lands of the two townships, the boundaries between the two parishes of Blyth and Harworth, not having been perambulated for many years, are now well nigh forgotten. The partition of the tithes of Styrrup and Olcotes is somewhat complicated. In Styrrup, Trinity College, Cambridge, the rectors and patrons of the parish of Blyth, pos sess five-ninths of the great tithes, and of the tithes of lamb and wool, of 1,349 A. 0 R. 8 P.; the Vicar of Harworth owning the remaining four-ninths, and being also owner of all tithes what ever of 459 a. 0 r. 6 p.

The former is also owner of all tithes, or moduses in lieu thereof, arising from 96 A. 2 R. 37 P., and of a modus of one shilling per acre over 19 a. In Olcotes there are exempt from all tithes 24 A. 1 R. 0 p., and from all small tithes, save lamb and wool, 167 A. 0 R. 27 P.; Trinity College and the Vicar of Harworth are owners of equal moieties of the great tithes and tithes of lamb and wool. The Vicars of Blyth and Harworth are owners of equal moieties of small tithes, except those of lamb and wool, of lands subject to such tithes ; and the former has also some small moduses. I pass with pleasure to a peculiarly interesting subject \u2014 The Ancient Tournament Ground between Blyth and Tickhill. This field was situated, as will appear from a document immediately to be cited, between Blyth and Tickhill. Other and subsequent instruments speak of it as being \" apud Blidam.\" We may then, I conceive, safely infer that it was on that level tract of ground, formerly uninclosed, which lies between Blyth and Styrrup, where it could be well vieAved on all sides. On account of this its position, I proceed to speak of it here. It is probable that these chivalrous and semi-military sports were in existence before the time of Richard I. Roger Wendover, in that portion of early history Avhich used until recently to be ascribed to Mathew Paris, mentions that Henry the young king, eldest son of Henry II., went over into France in 1179 and spent three years in the French conflicts and in splendid living, laying entirely aside the majesty of king, and that, having been successful in many encounters on the tournament field (fexis in gyrum fr\u0153nis), he obtained a wide-spread reputation, and on his return home was received with all due honour by his father. Richard I., hoAvever, it was who first gave formal and royal sanction to these exhibitions. In 1194 he licensed five places for public tournaments. These were (1) between Blyth and Tickhill, (2) between Sarum and Wilton, (3) between Warwick and Kenilworth, (4) between Stamford and Warinford, (5) betAveen Brackley and Mixbury. Four out of these five places may be said to have been central situations. It is interesting to bear in mind that in the next reign the barons met at Stamford, and there concerted measures of resistance against John ; that thence they marched to Brackley, from which place they sent a remonstrance to the King at Oxford, and that Magna Charta speedily followed. Did they meet at Stamford and Brackley in the first instance to hold"], [187, "ANCIENT TOURNAMENT GROUND BETWEEN BLYTH AND TICKHILL. 169 tournaments? and did the general seeling of indignation against the oppressions of the King give rise to ulterior measures? or were those measures the real, and the tournament only the ostensible, object of their assembling together? Wendover tells us that Richard's probable motive for constituting these tournament grounds Avas, that his subjects might thus be trained to the practised and dexterous use of arms against either the enemies of the Cross or against foes nearer home. \"a.d. 1194 Rex Ricardus in Angliam transiens statuit per loca certa torneamenta fieri, hac fortassis inductus ratione, ut milites regni undique concurrentes vires suas flexis in gyrum fr\u00e6nis cxperirentur, ut si bellum adversus crucis inimicos vel etiam finitimos movere decreverint, agiliores ad pr\u00e6lium et exercitatiores redderentur.\" In granting his licence Richard I. stipulates for the preservation of the peace and for abstinence from all damage to the royal forests ; and lays down stringent regulations touching the conduct, both in going to and returning from the games, of all who should take part therein, as, that they shall not molest any one by the way, nor by violence or wrong take victuals from any house for their use, and, if they are under any legal obligation, shall be bound by truce in going and coming. Every earl who intends to tournay shall pay into the King's exchequer twenty marcs; every baron ten, a landed knight four, a knight without land two. The Archbishop of Canterbury, to Avhom the writ is issued, is to have two of his elercs and two knights in the field, to take the oaths of the combatants, that, before they enter the lists, they will discharge their fees, to receive the money and enter it, permitting no one to tournay until payment has been made. Into the English tournaments then, although they originated not with him, C\u0153ur de Lion by this his royal licence doubtless infused much of his own intrepid and chivalrous character. They thenceforth became and long continued to be great national sports, magnificent exhibitions of arms and horsemanship, and brilliant displays of rank and beauty, as well as occasions of general festivity to the country at large; and the nobles ami gentry, not merely of England but of foreign countries likewise, plunged into them Avith the utmost ardour and avidity. It is the octaves of the Holy Trinity, a.i>. 1217, and summer has just commenced, and clothed the country around with all its genial warmth and beauty. Robert Fitzwalter, marshal of the Army of God and of Holy Church, and other nobles, have sent letters to the earls, barons, and knights of England, to assemble at Blyth during this week for a grand tournament, and right cheerfully has the summons been obeyed. The Angel Inn at Blyth, an inn from time immemorial, tin* Saracen's Head, and other inns and hostelries there, ami at Tickhill, Worksop, Retford, and even Doncaster, are crowded Avith the grooms and other humbler retainers of the great men who an* to take so prominent a part in the proceedings of the coming day, Avhile the magnates them selves, and their esquires, are receiving noble hospitality in the mansions of the lords of Tickhill, Worksop, Torksay, Conisborough, and Sprotborough. And now the eventful day has dawned which is to put to the proof the courage and skill of the noblest and best blood of England.

From every town and village for miles around may be seen the artizan and the peasant, in their best holiday attire, flocking to the great point of attraction, together with numerous wander ing pedlars and minstrels, who gain their living by following in the train of English chivalry, and whose wild appearance and restless habits give a peculiar hue and character to these gatherings. The lists are already fenced off, the ladies and gallant spectators are ranged around, the heralds have read to the combatants the rules of the tournay and announced the prizes, diamond, ruby, and sapphire rings, chargers, bears, and other rare and valuable gifts ;| and the arms are under examination by the constable of the gaines. The lances must be covered at the point with broad pieces of wood, the swords blunted (glaives courtois), the ' defensive armour simple, such as mufflers, cuishes, shoulder-plates, and the helmet light. And noAv this operation is over, and at the cry of the heralds \" a l'ostelle, a l'ostelle,\" the cavaliers retire within their tents to don their armour, and speedily re-appear Avith their helmets surmounted with chaplets and their lances adorned Avith streamers, the gifts of the beautiful and fair. They are arranged in two hostile troops; and on a signal from the Knight of Honour the heralds cry \" Laissez aller,\" and drop the cords which separate the combatants, who, addressing their spears to the rest and commending themselves to the ladies of their love, rush with headlong ardour to the encounter, while the trumpets sound the point of chivalry for every man to do his devoir. * Knight's Tale 2493, sqq: There are other vivid representations of tournaments in the Knight's Tale. -f* See Appendix."], [189, "171 ANCIENT TOURNAMENT GROUND BETWEEN BLYTH AND TICKHILL. The heralds note carefully the turns and events of the combat. To break a spear between the saddle and the helmet is one point of honour ; the knight who can break it on the helmet is deemed worthy of ten points; to strike an opponent out of his saddle merits three points; to take away the rest of an adversary's lance is greater distinction than to carry off any other part of his harness; to break it against the pommel of the saddle great disgrace, as it is also to break it traverse the breast of your foe, for, as it can only be done by the horse swerving on one side, it shows unskilful horsemanship. And noAv the nobles and knights have tested the skill and mettle of each other; the knight of honour drops his white baton and the heralds cry \" Ployez vos bannieres;\" the banners are folded, the prizes awarded, and the contending troops disarm. The ground is cleared, and the aristocracy in the halls of their high-bred hosts, the more humble spectators in the warm corners of the hostelries, or by their own firesides, discuss the events of the day and the comparative merits of Warren, De Vere, and others who have made a conspicuous figure in the tournament field of Blyth. To resume, \u2014 Henry III in 1232 giantcd a licence to various nobles for holding a tournament at Blyth. In process of time these sports of the spear (hastiludia, as they are called by our old historians) spread over the kingdom. Wendover, for example, mentions that, after the grant of Magna Charts in 1215, the barons retired to Stamford to hold a tournament; but in consequence of their suspicion of the movements of John they put it off and returned to London, where tournaments Avere arranged to be held in the neighbourhood at Staines Wood and Hounslow. In 1240 the Patent Rolls record an inhibition by public proclamation of a tournament at Leicester. Camden, however, informs us that the Earl of Pembroke, in defiance of the proclamation, held a meeting at Ware in the following year, which was attended by a very large concourse of nobility and gentry, and in which he himself lost his life by a fall from his horse. Matthew Paris mentions a tournament at Brackley in 1249, in which both English and foreign combatants engaged \u2014 the former consisting of a body or club Avho gave themselves the title of bachelors ; wild, dashing blades, no doubt, Avho preferred the excitement and splendour of the tournament lists to a more settled life. Once more, to show how general these sports had become, the Patent Rolls of Edward I., 1305, contain a prohibition ' ne qu\u00e6 torneamenta, hastiludia, etc. tencantur infra quinque miliar' universitatis Oxon.\" In fact, as time went on they came so much into fashion, that no circumstance of public festivity, no marriage among the nobles of the land, took place Avithout being celebrated by a mock display of arms. They were, however, very far from being at all times a mere mock display. Hot blood, the excitement of the moment, or any the slightest previous animosity, often stripped the lance of its foil, and made the glaives courtois effectual instruments of mischief. There arc records of even royal blood having been spilt at the Blyth tournaments ; and Knighton, when describing the tournament of Chalon in 1274, in which Edward I. with his nobles and knights tilted against the Count de Chalon and the distinguished men of Burgundy, records that so many were left on the field killed or wounded, that the tournament Avas called the \" little war of Chalon.\" Hence they Avere interdicted by the sovereign pontiffs of Rome professedly on grounds of humanity. In the Pandolph Correspondence at the Tower, No. 25, is a letter from the Cardinal, Elect of Norwich, z2"], [190, "172 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. os fair MMilan cardinal, and from Pope Innocent the legate here.* to Hugh de Burgh, Justiciary of England, forbidding all tournaments on pain of excommuni cation. But it would appear from the general council held at Lyons in 1245 that an additional objection urged against them was, that they drew away the chivalrous spirit of Europe from the wars against the Turks in Palestine. The Papal interdicts were backed by royal proclamations in England ; but both were fre quently set at defiance. Thus in April, 1223, Henry III. issued from Nottingham writs to the sheriffs of Essex, Buckingham, Leicester, Gloucester, Warwick, Oxford, Kent, Derby, Nottingham, and Devon, to seize the lands and chattels of Richard Mountfichet, Robert and William de Ferrers, Hugh de Gurnay, Thomas de Arden, Ralph de Normanville and Thomas his brother, Matthew de Haveresech, Lomus de Malvoers, Galfrid Gium, Simon de Hedon, Henry Teutonicus (Tyas), Henry de Tibetot, Peter de Condray, and others, on the ground of their having a little before been at a tournament \" apud Bliam contra prohibitionem nostram.\" These mighty men made their peace, doubtless, by paying heavy fines, for they were speedily reinstated in their estates. The mention of Blyth tournament field again recurs in 1255. In that year Henry III. issues a mandate to his earls, barons, and knights, from Clarendon, stating, that, although at the desire of the Duke of Limburg and Henry de Lessingburn he had granted a licence for tournament at Blvth in the Octaves of Trinity then next ensuing, the accounts which he had received of the perilous situation in which Prince Edward was placed in Gascony had induced him to Avithdraw it, and therefore that he strictly forbade a tournament for the present, either at Blyth or anywhere else. Edward I., on the 28th April, 1273, forbids by letters patent his subjects from tourneying or practising jousts or aventures or any other martial game, as they were intending to do at Blyth on the Thursday next after the feast of Saints Simon and Jude, without his special licence. And he further commands the Prior of Blyth to exhibit such letters to all earls, barons, and knights, and publicly to proclaim the prohibition. The Prior of Blyth, a grave and reverend man, attended by his monks, reading the King's letter on the tournament field of Blyth to the high aristocracy of England, Avith crowds of spectators surrounding them, Avould form no mean subject for the pencil of anv of our skilful artists. We have in the next reign a document to the same effect. Edward II. directs a precept Lewis to Pandolph\u2014 Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself, And brought in matter that should feed this fire ; And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out With that same weak wind which enkindled it.

What is that peace to me ? King John."], [191, "173 ANCIENT TOURNAMENT GROUND BETWEEN BLYTH AND TICKHILL. from Windsor, January 1, 1314, to the sheriff of Nottingham, to inform him that he had under stood that certain men were intending to hold a tournament at Blyth very soon, without his licence (unde plurimum admiramur nee immerito et movemur), and thereupon commanding him by public proclamation, both in Blyth and elsewhere, to forbid such tournament, either there or anywhere else, without his licence, and, in the event of violation of his command, to arrest the transgressor Avith horse and harness. For the purpose of the tournament the ground must have been fenced by an inner as Avell as outer ring, like our present race-courses. The two contending parties rode at each other at full speed, and after the encounter passed on and met again at the opposite side of the ground. The joust Avas a single combat. Two other expressions occur in ancient documents relative to the sports of chivalry, aventuras facere and bordeare. I think it probable that by the first we are to understand encounters taking place, so to speak, at a venture. Of the latter I cannot discover any satisfactory explanation. I have only to add, that the accident which befel Henry II. the French king, at a tournament at Paris in 1559, from a wound inflicted by the Count de Montgomeri, for a time arrested these sports on the Continent, whilst in England they continued to be popular so late as the reign of Elizabeth, Avho honoured them occasionally by her presence. The splendid pageants of the Blyth tournament field, and the great and princely men Avho figured in them, have all long since passed away, and the precise situation of the field itself is now matter of conjecture.

Eakly History and Descent of the Manors. We pass now to another county and another great fief. These two places are situated in the Avapentake of Strafsorth and Tickhill, in the West riding of the county of York, and on the borders of the counties of Nottingham and Lincoln. The origin of the name of Bawtry is involved in obscurity. I am inclined however to think that, as its port on the river Idle is extremely ancient, it supplied the latter part of the appellation; and the present abridged or corrupted form under which it presents itself is not more remote from the ancient hith or river station than the second syllable of our modern Chelsea (Chelshith) is from the same old root. The name does not occur in Domesday; but Bawtry was, like Austerfield, a member of the extensive Yorkshire manor of Hexthorpe, near Doncaster, which before the Conquest formed part of the possessions of Earl Tosti, and after that event of the Conqueror's maternal brother, the Earl of Mortaigne, or Morton. At the time of Domesday Nigel Fossard held a considerable portion of the Yorkshire estates of the Earl of Morton, and among others the manor of Hexthorpe, including of course Bawtry and Austerfield. Fossard again sub-infeuded the family of Arnaldus, the brother of Roger de Builli, and that family continued thenceforth Lords of Bawtry and Austerfield for more than two centuries. Some account of this branch of the Buillis has already been given down to the time of Idonea, the direct descendant in the fourth generation of Arnaldus. Idonea de Builli, died in 1235,-pRobert de Veteri Ponti, or Vipont, mar. eirc.1213 ; died in I s l 1 John de Vipont, High Sheriff of-pSybilla, dau of William Earl Ferrers Christiana, mar.

Roger de Clifford, who jure uxoris possessed died 1334, s. p. Brougham Castle; slain in Welsh wars, 1282. Robert de Vipont was a great supporter of King John, from whom he received the baronies of Appleby and Brough, in Westmerland, together with the bailiwick of that county. In 1213 he procured from the Crown a charter for a fair at Bawtry, to continue four days in Whitsun week. His wife, who survived him, confirmed and enlarged the privileges of the bus o*esses of Bawtrv"], [193, "BAWTRY AND AUSTERFIELD. 175 granting them a meadoAV between that town and the park of the Archbishop of York at Scrooby, estovers in the turf moors of Silchemes, ChipA-aimes, and Abbemos, and ratifying their tenure of the tofts as they held them in her husband's lifetime at a rent of I2d. each, as well as the free enjoyment of their manorial courts. Her deed was attested between 1228 and 1235 by Walter Grey, Archbishop of York, Gilbert Prior of Blyth, Reginald Abbot of Roche, Sir Marmaduke Darell, her steward, Sir W. Cressy, Geffery and John Clarel, and others; and Avas sealed with her seal, a figure of a lady Avith a haAvk perched upon her hand. In the division of the Vipont estates between the co-heiresses Idonea and Isabel, the latter lady received the Cumberland and Westmerland property, whilst Bawtry, Austerfield, and other Yorkshire possessions came to Idonea, whose second husband, John de Cromwell, Avas constable of the Tower, was summoned to Parliament as a baron from 1 EdAv. II. to 9 EdAV. III., and in the 11th Edw. II. was made governor of Tickhill Castle. This last-named lady, as appears by a quo warranto Avrit of Edward I., possessed free warren at Bawtry, Austerfield, and Kimbcrworth, where she chiefly resided, as also the common manorial powers and privdeges of gallows, infangthefe, outfangthefc, market, fair, and assize of bread and beer in BaAvtry. She died in 1334, and was buried with her ancestors in Roche Abbey. By a post mortem inquisition it appeared that she enjoyed a rent of 24/. from Bawtry and Austerfield. Idonea dying without issue, the greater portion of her Yorkshire property passed to the Cliffords, descendants of her sister Isabel. Inasmuch however as the Cliifords were adherents of Thomas Earl of Lancaster, it would appear that even during her lifetime Hugh Despcnser, Earl of Winchester, the special favourite of Edward 11., interposed his influence between these the natural claimants and BaAvtry and Austerfield, and by an oppressive exercise of his poAver with the Crown effected an appropriation of these manors to himself and his family. In the descendants of Hugh Despenscr, who allied themselves with royal and noble blood, these manors continued from the reign of Edward II. to that of Edward IV. A female of this house, Isabella Despenser, was twice married, first, to Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Worcester, secondly, to Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, by the latter of whom she had a daughter, Anne Beauchamp, Avho married Richard Neville, in her right Earl of Warwick, the king-maker, who was killed at the battle of Barnet in 1471. This mighty man was, at the time of his death, seized of the manors of Bawtry and Austerfield, which were forfeited by his treason. His daughter, Anne Neville, was the wife, first, of Edward Prince of Wales, secondly, of King Richard 111. After the forfeiture of the Earl of Warwick the manors reverted to the Crown, and remained there till the time of James I., Avho granted them, together Avith the tolls, duties, profits of fairs and markets, &c, to the Countess of Shrewsbury and Catharine Witherington, for their lives; and in the 20th of his reign the reversion thereof to Robert Thomlinson and James Wells, who, about 1633, sold the manors to Sir John Lister, an opulent merchant of Hull. Sir John Lister gave the BaAvtry and Austerfield estates to a younger son, Thomas, Avho resided at Bawtry and connected himself with one of the oldest and best families in Yorkshire, marrying Barbara, daughter of MatthcAv Hutton of Marsk, near Richmond, Esq., by his wife Barbara, daughter of Conyers Lord Darcy. He died at BaAvtry in 1G74 and was buried in the church. Elizabeth and Judith Lister, the tAvo sisters and heirs of John Lister, a descendant of Thomas above named, sold these manors to Pemberton Milnes of Wakcsield, Esq., in 1779."], [194, "176 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. The Family of Milnes. This family is found located at Ashford, in the county of Derby, from an early period. Mr. Milnes, the purchaser of Bawtry and Austerfield, was a deputy -lieutenant and magistrate of the West riding. He had an only daughter and heir, Bridget, who married, firstly, at Brodsworth, 28 Nov. 1775, Peter Auriol Drummond, Esq., second son of the Archbishop of York and brother of the Earl of Kinnoul; and, secondly, at Harworth, in 1803, Robert Monckton Arundell, fourth Viscount Galway. After his lordship's death, in 1810, the dowager resided chiefly at Bawtry Hall. She died in 1836, and was succeeded in these estates by Robert Pemberton Milnes, of Frystone Hall, near Ferrybridge, Esq., the eldest son of her cousin, Richard Slater Milnes, Esq. Mr. R. P. Milnes for some years represented Pontefract, and in the administration of Mr. Perceval was offered a situation of high dignity and importance, which he declined. He was an accomplished scholar, possessed great stores of knowledge, which a remarkably retentive memory enabled him to produce and apply with happy effect in society, and on public occasions spoke with great poAver and fluency. But he was a man not only of intellectual but of moral excellence. In my official capacity as incumbent of Bawtry and Austerfield I frequently had occasion to solicit his aid for religious and charitable purposes, and I bear this cheerful and willing testimony to the readiness and the generosity with which he ever responded to the appeals thus made to him. I believe further, that in all places with which he was connected by property or other ties the same kindness and liberality are acknowledged to have been exercised. Mr. Milnes died Nov. 1858, and was succeeded by his only son, Richard Monckton Milnes, Esq., who has been member for Pontefract since 1837. The Chapelries of Baavtry and Austerfield. In the reign of Henry II. John de Builli gave the chapels of Bawtry and Austerfield to the convent of Blyth. Now the door-way of Austerfield church is of this date. It is a compound arch, with zig-zag and beak ornaments, and a rude carving of a dragon upon the door-way plane. A door-way on the north side of Bawtry church is of the same age. The legitimate inference is, that Builli built both these churches. If so, a question arises, Were there any churches here before his time? which must, I think, be answered in the negative; for if there were they must in all probability have been parochial; and in that case Ave should have heard of a more formal appro priation to the convent, and of the institution and endowment of a vicarage. And yet this conclusion throws us on another difficulty. If there were no churches here before the reign of Henry II. whither did the inhabitants resort for the offices of religion? Naturally, we may imagine, to the nearest church, Avhich would be either Harworth or Scrooby; and the severance of the tithes of the two chapelries from such church, and attachment of them to Blyth, form no insuperable bar to this hypothesis, for these arbitrary re-appropriations were exceedingly common long after the Conquest. Idonea, the daughter of John de Builli, in her liege widowhood confirmed these donations of her father. In the ordination of Blyth vicarage, in 1287, the vicar was endoAved with all tithes of these"], [195, "177 CHAPELRIES OF BAWTRY AND AUSTERFIELD. chapelries except that of grain, and Avas bound to serve them by two fit presbyters. Whether this part of his obligation was ever literally carried out, and if so, how long it continued to be performed, I know not. Certain it is that in the reign of Elizabeth it had fallen into desuetude; and in the last century divine service was performed once in each chapel, and that only on alternate Sundays. My predecessor, in the latter years of his incumbency, had a resident curate at Bawtry, who performed divine service in both Bawtry and Austerfield once every Sunday, for which the inhabitants made him a voluntary recompence. I folloAved the example of Mr. Rudd, but never asked for any remuneration for my curate. The Prior and Convent of Blyth did not consider themselves in the light of rectors of these chapels, for the simple reason, I presume, that they Avere not parochial. This appears from a settlement of a dispute effected by the official of the Archdeacon of Nottingham, at Retford, Jan. 10, 1277, between the convent, represented by their sub-prior Victor, and the inhabitants of Bawtry, represented by Lambert of Bawtry, Thomas East, Hu<di the Clerk, and others, respecting the liability of the parties to repair the chancel of the church. It was agreed that the inhabitants should repair it at their own expense; that the convent should give them two marcs as a contri bution, \" non necessitate juris astricti, sed gratia speciali \" : and that such gift should not be made a precedent for future demands. It would appear that in earlier years, after the attachment of the chapelries of Bawtry and Austerfield to Blyth, funerals from these places took place at the mother church; but, as might have been expected, one being four and the other live miles distant from it, such an arrangement Avas found to be inconvenient, and was infringed. In consequence of Avhich, 25 April 1315, the Archbishop of York inhibited sepultures at these chapelries or any other chapels depending upon Blyth. But, Jan. 5, 1344, permission was granted to inter in the chapel or cemetery of Bawtry, on account of its distance from the mother church. In the Survey of Chantries for the county of Nottingham, 37 Henry VIII. there is a return, that \" the gilde of Bawtrie Avas founded bv one Nicolas Morton, and his coefeoffers, to the intent to have a priest there to praye for the soules of the lumefactors of the same duringe the pleasure of the said feoffees, as apperithe by a composition dated anno xi nunc regis Henr.

This bequest Avas for many years paid to the curates, but about thirty years ago Marl Rosslyn, the representative of the Listers, on the advice of his agent, Mr. Tottie of Leeds, demurred to the payment till his liability could be distinctly proved. My predecessor and his 2 A"], [196, "178 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. curate, the Rev. W. Cuthbert, took considerable pains to substantiate the claim, but without success, and the consequence has been that the legacy is lost. The Church of Baavtry. With the exception of an ancient doorway in the north aisle, the first towards the west, now partially blocked up, no part of the present church bears the impress of the age of John de Builli. It consists of a nave and two aisles, all conterminous. The piers, arches, and eastern nave window were all built about the middle of the reign of Edw. III. The windows of the clerestory and aisles have been probably altered from an earlier and better shape to their present flat-headed form ; and the tower at the west end of the nave was built in 1712. Among the monumental inscriptions on the floor of the nave are the following: \u2014 \" Hie jacent Joftes Hobert marcator et catia \" Depositum Thom\u00e6 Lister, armigeri, quinti Filii Johannis Lister, militis: denati quarto die Maii, 1674. Quatuor habuit Filios, Johannem, Philippum, Thomam, et Hugonem superstites.\" \" Here lieth the body of John Hutton, sonne and heire of Matthew Hutttfn of Marsk, esquire: obiit xxi. die Martii, Anno Dni. 1 ...4.\" In 1839 the old pews, consisting of every variety of form, colour, ornament, and height, and an unsightly gallery were all swept away. The church was thoroughly repaired and re-pewed at an expense of about 900/.; and in 1857 an excellent organ was added. If ever the inhabitants of Bawtry should contemplate further improvements in their Church, it would become a matter for their serious consideration whether it might not be more expedient to build an entirely new church elsewhere. The present church can never by any process whatever be made handsome ; the soil around its walls, as well as in the churchyard, is saturated with water, and the cemetery itself is now far too small for the requirements of the population. The Hospital of Saint Mary Magdalene Is contiguous to Bawtry, but in the parish of Harworth, and county of Nottingham. Who was the original founder is not known. King John, in the second year of his reign, in his grant to the church of Rouen includes the church of Harworth, with the chapels of Serlby and Marthon, that is, Martin, a hamlet or township, within which the hospital is situated, and the hospital chapel of which therefore is probably meant. Robert Morton, eseheator of the county of Nottingham, and member of the shire from 1361 to 1393, gave in 1390 to the prior and convent of Nostel the sum of 250Z., for which they stipu lated to pay eight marcs yearly for ever to the chaplain for the time being of the hospital, to pray for the donor and his family. This sum is still paid to the master of the hospital by the Crown. Morton was an eminent and opulent and charitable man. His will, which was proved at Worksop Nov. 9, 1396, having been made at Bawtry Aug. 25 of the same year, is headed in the archiepis copal register with the words bonce memori\u0153, a designation in no other instance applied to any one beneath the rank of a nobleman. Among his bequests are the folloAving: \u2014 \"Corpus meum sepeli endum in capella B. Maria; Ecclesi\u00e6 Conventualis de Wyrksop.

P. Milnes, Esq., and by his will transferred to Viscount Galway; and of the precincts of the chapel. If these leases were suffered to expire, and I cannot think that the two noblemen who have a beneficial interest in them would raise any objection to such a course, the master of the hospital would then be put in possession of property the rent of which would go far towards providing a reasonable stipend for the minister officiating for the time being. Two widows are provided out of the charity, each with a house and 20s. yearly. Torre, in his MSS. at York, gives a catalogue of the masters from 1289 to the beginning of the last century. One of these, .lames BreAvster, presented by Archbishop Sandys in 1584, and Vicar of Sutton, appears to have been an unscrupulous man, and for his own aggrandisement to have aimed at the subversion of the hospital. With this view he put an end to the services which had hitherto been performed on Wednesdays and Fridays, destroyed the stalls and furniture of the chapel, and, passing the estates at the Augmentation Office as concealed lands, procured a convey ance of them from the Crown to lay hands. A good deal of litigation ensued, which was finally terminated by a decree in the Exchequer, Feb. 6, 1596, in savour of the Archbishop of York, who is ex officio patron. John Slack, who was appointed master in 1610, restored the chapel; and in 1674 was collated to the office a man who, in conjunction with his six noble-hearted fellow-patriots and fellow sufferers, has earned perpetual and grateful homage, and won an undying reputation, among all 2 A 2"], [198, "180 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. Englishmen. This was John Lake, aftenvards Bishop of Chichester, and one of the seven bishops who gave the death-bloAv to the tyranny of James II. But, if he resisted oppression, he brooked not usurpation, and, like others of his brethren, refusing to swear allegiance to the Prince of Orange, was depriATed of his see. The ancient buildings of this foundation, with the exception of the chapel, have all long ago disappeared. In 1834, when I visited the chapel for the first time, it was used as a carpenter's shop. Shortly afterwards the late Henry Marwood Greaves, of Hesley Hall, Esq., at his own cost, and to his great credit, restored it for divine service, and continued throughout his life, as his representatives continue noAv, to contribute a large portion of the stipend of the minister, who acts in place of the master, and solemnizes service in it every Sunday. Charitable Bequest. In 1780 Elizabeth Forster of Grantham, widow, bequeathed two cottages, now called the Bell-houses, and a rent-charge of 20s. issuing out of a field in Misson, to two poor unmarried women belonging to Bawtry, and of the respective ages of 60 years and upwards, to be appointed by the incumbent of Bawtry for the time being. Schools. A school was founded here in 1822, the master of which was to be a member of the Church of England, to be appointed by a committee of the inhabitants, and to teach the Church Catechism, but not in cases where parents and guardians objected to it. This school was in 1848 made available to the poor by a voluntary subscription, which enabled the master to reduce his charges to the lowest amount. In 1857 an infant school was erected by voluntary contributions upon a site given by the late R. P. Milnes, Esq. for religious education in strict connection with the Church of England, the mistress of which is appointed by and removable at the discretion of the incumbent. Austerfield. The derivation of the name of this village from Ostorius, a Roman general, is of course pure hallucination. It is the old Scandinavian Osterfjeld \u2014 the Eastern -field. In Domesday it is written Oustrefeld. The church is the original church of John de Builli, consisting simply of one aisle divided into nave and chancel by a coeval round arch. The windows are insertions of a later age, but some of them of good character, and exhibiting fragments of ancient stained glass ; and the two bells are suspended in a simple bell gable, very like that of the beautiful church of Wycliffe. It is dedicated to St. Helen, as appears by the folloAving extract from an ancient will: \"13 Ap. 1471, Ego Nicholaus Hancok de Braincroft parochi\u00e6 de Austyrfeld Corpus sepeliendum in ecclesia Sanct\u00e6 Elen\u00e6 de A. coram altari Sancti Nicholai Lego ad duas torchias confi ciendas viiis. Lego ad unam capam emcndam xs.\" The church in 1834 was in an unsatisfactory condition. The open pews, some of them"], [199, "181 FIRST COLONISTS OF NEW ENGLAND. containing excellent work of the Decorated period, which Avas carefully preserved, were incon veniently low and out of repair ; and the wooden floor, if there had ever been one, had perished. The church was therefore re-pewed and a new gallery added. I take leave here to state, with reference to the re-pewing both of this church and of that of Bawtry, that if the work had been done a few years later it would have been done differently, and I Avould fain persuade myself better. But we acted according to the light and the information which we then possessed ; and the study of ecclesiastical arrangement was then altogether in its infancy. The manor has descended in precisely the same course with that of BaAvtry. Idonea de Vipont, or her father, John de Builli, for there is some uncertainty as to the donor, gave 13J bovates of land in this place to the Knights Templars for the maintenance of a chaplain to celebrate in their house at London for the soul of her husband, herself, and her family. Mr. Hunter conjectures, with great probability, that this estate was that which the Earls of Scarborough once possessed here, and which was sold by them to the Listers, and thence came to the family of Milnes. The commons and wastes of this township, which is of considerable extent, Avere inclosed in 1765, Avhen an allotment of land Avas assigned to the vicar of the parish in lieu of by far the greatest portion of his tithes. From some cause, with Avhich I am unacquainted, the rectorial tithes Avere not commuted for land. The First Colonists of Neav England. From Austerfield, and from the neighbouring parish of Scrooby, went forth William Bradford and William Brewster, the first governor and first elder of the congregation of the founders of New Plymouth, the parent colony of New England, of whom Mr. Hunter has given so full and so interesting an account, that I refer my readers with confidence to his volume for further and more complete details upon the subject. I will merely state that William Bradford, as appears by the baptismal register of Austerfield, was baptised there March 19, 1589, his father being a small free holder; and, having attended the ministrations of the Rev. Clifton, a puritan rector of Babworth, about eight miles distant from Austerfield, joined before he had reached his eighteenth year the Separatist congregation at Scrooby, which was presided over by William Brewster in a farm house, a remnant of the ancient palace of the Archbishops of York. BreAvstcr had been private secretary to Davidson, the Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth, and on the disgrace of that minister after the execution of the Queen of Scots retired to Scrooby, a village two miles from Austerfield, and situated on the great north road, Avhcre he held the situation of postmaster, and in which he was probably born. Tin: Neav Benefice of Baavtry-avith-Austerfield By an order of the Queen in Council dated July 31, 1858, the townships of Bawtry and Austerfield Avere separated from the vicarage and parish church of Blyth, and constituted a separate parish and a separate benefice, by the name of the Perpetual Curacy of Bawtry Avith Austerfield, of which the master, fellows, and scholars of Trinity College, Cambridge, shall be the patrons, and the church of Bawtry the parish church."], [200, "182 HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF BLYTH. This benefice is endowed with tithe rent-charges amounting to 300Z. per annum, subject to the deduction of property-tax alone, including two rent-charges of 6AI. 10s. and of 91. 10s. issuing from Bawtry and Austerfield respectively, and hitherto belonging to the vicarage of Blyth. It is further endowed with all mortuaries, surplice-fees, and other payments heretofore paid to the vicar of Blyth : and when taken by a fellow vacating his fellowship is augmented out of the funds of the college by an annual grant of 2001. ; thus raising the living to 5001. a-year, subject to the deduction of property-tax alone. The order with my consent took immediate effect, and shortly afterwards the Rev. Augustus Dobree Carey, a fellow of the college, was presented to the new benefice. Although I consented that this arrangement should take immediate effect, I cannot affect to deny the fact that it never had my hearty concurrence. It is rarely indeed that we can improve the acts of our ancestors. The comparatively enfeebled and inadequate poAvers of the Anglican Church are, I conceive, in a large measure attributable to departure from their principles \u2014 I say not doctrines \u2014 and plunder of their endowments. It is perfectly true that the only authorities whose consent is necessary for effecting such a separation as this of Bawtry and Austerfield from the mother church are the patron, ordinary, and archbishop of the province, which, when con firmed by the Crown, necessarily takes effect on the next avoidance of the living. The existing incumbent has no authority whatever in the matter. He has merely the power of accepting, or if he pleases, of deferring the separation during his own lifetime. Such is one of those laws in the enactment of which the clergy of course have no voice. Still the experience and information accumulated by an incumbent of any standing justify him in propounding his views, and entitle him to be heard, when measures seriously affecting the spiritual welfare of his parish are in contemplation. Under this conviction I endeavoured to impress upon the patrons some years ago, Avhen this subject Avas first agitated, the impropriety of taking for the formation of their new benefice anything whatever, beyond the ordinary fees, from the endowments of a large parish, the position and claims of which necessarily subjected the vicar to heavy outlays, more especially as those endoAvments had in times past been so severely and so unjustly injured by the moduses of which I have spoken, and as the rectory, which the patrons enjoyed, was little, if at all, short of 3,000?. a-year. I recommended that they should augment the stipend of the curate of Bawtry and Austerfield to the extent of 1501. per annum, for which the services of a valuable and efficient clergyman would readily have been secured and retained; and at the same time provide a church and clergyman for the benefit of Ranskill, Torworth, and Barnby Moor, three adjacent villages of the parish, where none existed, and Avhere, by so doing, a real and acknowledged want would have been met and supplied. My suggestions were not acted upon; and, as already stated, the new benefice has been constituted, and an incumbent appointed. I have thought it expedient to place my views upon record, Valeant quantum valent. For Trinity College, that most illustrious of all seminaries, which has never ceased to contribute so largely to the supply of men duly qualified to serve God, both in Church and State, I have a profound veneration. For the Church of England I have a more profound veneration still. With all my love for this great house, I, in common with very many other of its alumni, have ahvays regretted that it should have had such a foundation as the ancient parochial endow-"], [201, "183 THE NEW BENEFICE OF BAWTRY-WITH-AUSTERFIELD. ments of this country. And the best wish which I can utter for my college and for all other similarly endowed institutions is this, \u2014 that, being ever mindful of the nature of their endowments and of the obligations imposed upon them by their founders, they may make the wants of the Church their first care, and thus dutifully minister to her, whose handmaids it is their highest honour to be, and with whose welfare their own is inseparably bound up and united. And now, by the blessing of a benign Providence, I have completed a task which I have had at heart for many years, but the accomplishment of which various causes have hitherto conspired to arrest. If this volume shall afford my wealthier friends and parishioners, and through their kindness and indulgence my poorer brethren, the means of spending a few moments now and then in innocent recreation \u2014 if it shall attach them with interest to the soil in which their lot has been cast \u2014 if it shall in any degree contribute to engender feelings of gratitude in any of my readers, wherever situate, whilst contrasting the past convulsions of England, civil and religious, with the tranquillity which they are now permitted to enjoy \u2014 above all, if the contemplation of the unceasing vicissitude of all earthly things and possessions, to which these pages bear testimony, shall teach them to transfer their thoughts and affections to a higher and better Avorld \u2014 then I shall have laboured in an undertaking not altogether alien to my profession, nor, I would humbly hope, altogether barren of. fruit to the honour of Him, whose I am, and whom I serve.

Berset, Basset. \u2014 It is known to most of my readers that from the quarries of the Duke of Leeda and of Charles Wright, Esq., adjoining the village of MNorth Austan, in the west riding of the county of York, and touching each other, was obtained the stone with which the new Houses of Parliament were built, and that it is beginning to perish. Mr. Wright gave me recently, on the spot, the following explana tion of this fact. In the first place the contractors took stone from quarries of the Duke which was visibly unsound and of inferior quality, although soft to work. 2. They won stone too near the basset-edge \u2014 to use Mr. Wright's own expression \u2014 that is, they Avon it from the surface forwards, driving, so to speak, the quarry before them, instead of working deep from the first: and 3. The quarries of the Duke Avere, in several instances, marked by fissures which had become filled with soil, and the consequence was, that the stone in contact with these fissures was soft and bad. Mr. Wright's quarries were deep, perfect, and sound, and the stone thence taken good. This explanation of a practical man, in itself interesting, will, I think, answer the purpose for which I give it, and elucidate the word berset, basset. It must mean sloping, and this interpretation corresponds with the actual character of our Bassetlaw. P. 7. The name of Lincoln. \u2014 The former part only of this word of course must be understood as being stated to be of indigenous origin. P. 19. Since my account of Tickhill was written I have been induced to make another and a very careful examination of the remains of Tickhill Castle. The mound upon which the keep was built is a natural rock of new red sandstone, as is distinctly proved by excavations made a feAV years ago by Mr. Lumley, of Tickhill Castle, the father of the present Earl of Scarborough. This mound was strengthened by two or three concentric bands of strong masonry, of the lowest of which a very distinct portion remains to the north-west, in continuation of, but projecting beyond, the outer wall of the castle. At the summit of all, at a height probably of sixty or seventy feet above the moat, are. the foundations of a wall very nearly twelve feet thick, built in the form of a regular figure of ten sides, each of which is somewhat more than twelve feet in length, and supported with buttresses at every angle about five feet wide These are clearly the foundations of the keep, which must have possessed marvellous strength and security, and have commanded a perfect view of the country around. So that Camden's description of it is substantially correct, \" a round citadel on an elevated mound,\" for it would appear round from beneath or at a distance; and it must have borne a strong resemblance to the keep of Durham Castle before the recent alterations \u2014 I do not say improvements \u2014 by that failing body the University of Durham. I have only to add, that I think the gateway of Tickhill Castle a portion of De Builli's work, the room over it being much later. P. 40. On the subject of these \"honorary associates,\" as he terms them, see Lingard, \"Hist, and Antiq. of Anglo-Saxon Church,\" ii. 63-67. P. 54. A noble tower was in like manner inserted in the fifteenth century by the monks of Furness, iu the west end of the nave of their church \u2014 fine portions of which, especially the deep and niched buttresses, still remain. P. 55. I have here made a distinction between a guild or fraternity and a chantry. The common religious obligation of the former (for they had various secular objects) was \" that of accompanying the bodies of the deceased members to the grave, of paying the soul-shot for them at their interment, and of distributing alms for the repose of their souls.\" Vide Lingard, \" Anglo Sax. Church,\" ii. 62. A chantry properly implies a foundation bequeathed by the donor with a view to secure after his death the benefit of prayers and other religious offices for his soul. The two are not always, either in name or object, kept distinct from each other. Vide p. 177. P. 86. I ought to have mentioned here that a school for infants and girls, which is open to the parish, was built a feAV years ago by II. F. Walker, Esq., of Blyth Hall; and is maintained at his sole expense."], [203, "APPENDIX, I. P. 40. \u2014 H. Rex Ang. Ger.

P. 163. \u2014 Karissimo domino suo Henrico Dei gratia Regi Angli\u00e6, domino Hyberni\u00e6, Duci Normanni\u00e6, Aquitani\u00e6, Comiti Andegavi\u00e6, fidelis suus Philippus de Ulecot' salutem et devotum obsequium et fidele. Bene scit dominacio vestra qualiter apud Gloucestriam lata suit sententia excommunicationis in omnes illos qui pacem vestram et regni vestri perturbarent. Dominus vero Dunolmensis Episcopus spreta ilia sententia, cum post recessum suum de Gloucestria venisset usque Dunolm', voluit expellere me de quadam terra quam teneo in Episcopatu Dunolmensi et quam pacifice possedi a longo tempore antequam idem Episcopus est consecratus usque nunc. Ego verb volens pacem rengni vestri postulavi pacem vestram et posui me et meam possessionem sub protectione et pace vestra, offerens dicto Episcopo qu5d accederem ad curiam vestram vel suam et libenter starem judicio curi\u00e6 vestr\u00e6 vel su\u00e6. Ipse vero spretis verbis meis misit multitudinem servientum suorum cum equis et armis ad terrain et domos meas et recludit homines meos, custodi entes terram meam et domos meas, infra domum quandam, et apposito ingne in quatuor partibus domus illius homines meos cepit et violenter tractavit, et tamquam latrones duxit usque Dunolm' et incarceravit et detinet incarceratos. Supplico igitur dominacioni vestr\u00e6 quatenus si placet istud mihi et non solum mihi immo et vobis et paci rengni vestri injuriose factum emendari faciatis. Nolo enim vobis inconsultis aliquid facere per quod viderer rengnum et pacem vestram perturbare. Tantum inde facientes si placet ne alii exemplo ipsius minime timeant pacem rengni vestri pertur bare et infringere. Valete in Domino. (Arch\u00e6olog. \u00c6liana, iii. New Series, p. 29.) XXIV.

Sciatis etiam certissime, quod pr\u00e6moniti fuerimus, quod quidam sunt, qui nihil aliud expectant, riisi quod recessissemus a civitate pr\u00e6dicta, ut ita subito earn possent occupare : et ideo per commune consilium prolongavimus torneamentum, quod c\u0153ptum suit apud Stanford die Lun\u00e6 proximo post festum Apostolorum Petri et Pauli, usque ad diem Lun\u00e6 proximo post octavas pr\u00e6dictas. Erit autem torneamentum juxta Londinum in bruera de Stanes et villa de Hundeslawe, et hoc fecimus propter securitatem nostram et securitatem civitatis pr\u00e6dict\u00e6.
