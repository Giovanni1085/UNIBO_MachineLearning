Franco still retained Louisiana ; but the province had so far failod to meet the expectations of tho crown and tho people that a change in the govsrnment and policy of tho country was doomed indispensable. Accordingly, in 1711, ths province was placed in the hands of a Governor General, with headquarters at Mobilo. Ibis govern- ment was of brief duration, and in 1712 a charter was granted to Anthony Cro^at, a wealthy merchant ol Faris, giving him tho entire control aud mo- nopoly ol all tho trads and resources ol Louisiana. Rut this scheme also failed. Cro^at met with no success in his commercial operations ; overy 8panish harbor on the Gull was closed against his vessels; the occupation ol Louisiana was deemed an encroachment on 8panish territory ; 8pain was joalous ol the am- ditiou ol France. Failing in his efforts to opon ths ports ol tbe district, Cro2at \" sought to develop ths internal resources ol Louisiana, by causing trading posts to be opened, and explorations to bo mado to its remotest borders. Rut he actually accomplished nothing lor the advancement ol the colony. Iho only prosperity which it ever possessed grew out ol tho enterprise of humble indi- viduals, who had succeeded in instituting a little barter between themselves and the natives, and a petty trads with neighboring European settlements. a persevering effort of nearly five years, he surrendered his charter in August, 1717.\" Immediately following tho surrender ol his charter by Cro2at, anothor and moro magnificent scheme was inaugurated. Ihe national government ol France was deeply involved in debt; the colonies were nearly bankrupt, and dohn Law appeared on tho scene with his famous Mississippi Company, as tho Louisiana branch of tho Rank of Franco. Ihe charter granted to this company gave it a legal existence ol twonty-five years, and conferred upon it moro extensive powers and privileges than had been granted to Cro-at. It invested the new company with tho exclusive privilege of the entire commerce of Louisiana, and of New Franco, a ad with authority to enforce thoir rights. Ihe Company was author- i2ed to monopolixo all tho trado in tho country; to mako treaties with the Indians ; to declare and prosseuto war ; to grant lands, erect forts, open mines ol precious metals, levy taxes, nominato civil officers, commission those of the army, and to appoint and removo judges, to cast cannon, and build and equip ships of war. this was to be dono with tho paper currency of dohn Law's Rank of Franco. Us had suocscdsd in getting Fiis Majesty the French Xing to adopt and sanction his scheme of financial operations both in Franco and in tho colonies, and probably there never was such a huge financial bubble ever dlown by a visionary theorist. 8till, such was tho condition of Franco that i(. was accepted as a national deliverance, and Law became the most powerful man in France. He became a Catholio, and was appointed Comptroller General of Finance. vVmong the first operations ol tho Company was to send eight hundred emigrants to Louisiana, who arrived at Dauphino Island in 1718."], [157, "143 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. In 1719, Fhilipe Francis Renault arrived in Illinois with two hundred miners and artisans. Ihe war between France and 8pain at this time rendered it extremely probable that the Mississippi Valley might becomo tho theater ol 8panish hostilities against the French settlements ; to prevent this, as well as to extend French claims, a chain ol forts was begun, to Keep open ths connection botween the mouth and tho sources ol tho Mississippi. Fort Orleans, high up the Mississippi River, was erected as an outpost in 1720. Iho Mississippi scheme was at the Zenith ol its power and glory in January, 1720, but tbe gigantic bubble collapsed moro suddenly than it had been inflated, and the Company was declared hopelessly bankrupt in May following. Franco was impoverished by it, both private and public credit were overthrown, capi talists suddenly found themselves paupers, and labor was loft without employ ment. Ihe effect on tho colony of Louisiana was disastrous. Whils this was going on in Lower Louisiana, tho region about tho lakes was ths theater ol Indian hostilities, rendering the passage from Canada to Louisiana extremely dangerous lor many years. Ihe English had not only extended their Indian trade into the vicinity ol tho French settlements, but through their friends, the Iroquois, had gainod a marked ascendancy over the Foxes, a fierce and poworlul tribe, ol Iroquois descent, whom they incited to hostilities against the French. Ihe Foxos began thsir hostilities with the siege ol Detroit in 1712, a siogs which they continued lor nineteen eonsocutivo days, and although tho expedition resulted in diminishing their numbers and humbling their pride, yet it was not until alter several successive campaigns, embodying the best military resources ol New France, had been directed against them, that were finally defeated at tho great battles ol Rutto des Moris, and on tho Wisconsin River, and driven west in 1746. Ihe Company, having lound that tho cost ol delending Louisiana exceeded the returns lrom its commerce, solicited leave to surrender the Mississippi wilderness to tho homo government. Accordingly, on tho 10th ol 1732, tho jurisdiction and control over the commerce reverted to tho crown ol Franco. Iho Company had hold possession ol Louisiana lourtoen years. In 1735, Lien- ville returned to assume command lor tho Fving. glancs at a low ol tho old French settlements will show tho progress made in portions ol Louisiana during tho oarly part ol ths eighteenth century, early as 1705, traders and hunters had penetrated the fertile regions of tho Wabash, and lrom this region, at that early date, fifteen thousand hides and skins had been collected and sent to Mobilo for tho European market. In the year 1716, the French population on tho Wabash Kept up a lucrative eommorco with Mobile by means of traders and voyageurs. Ihe Ohio River was comparatively unknown. In 1746, agriculture on the Wabash bad attained to greater prosperity than iu any of the French settlements besides, and in that year six hundred barrels of Hour were manufactured and shipped to New Orleans, together with consider- abls quantities of hides, peltry, tallow and beeswax. In the Illinois country, also, considerable settlements had been made, so that, iu 1730, they embraced ons hundred and forty French families, about' six liundrod \" converted Indians,\" and many traders and voyageurs. In 1753, tho first actual conflict aroso between Louisiana and the Atlantic colonies. From the earliest advent of ths Jesuit fathers, up to tho period ol which wo speak, tho great ambition ol tho French had been, not alone to preserve their possessions in tho West, but dy every possibly moans to prevent the slightest attempt ol tbe English, east ol the mountains, to extend their sett!e\u00bb"], [158, "144 HISTOItV OF THU STATD OF IOWA. ments toward tho Mississippi. Franco was resolved on retaining possossion ol the great territory which hor missionaries had discovered and revealed to the world. Fronch commandants had avowed their purpose ol soiling every Englishman within tho Ohio Valley. Ihe colonies ol Fsnnsylvania, Now VorK and Virginia woro most affected by the encroachments ol Franco in tho extension ol her dominion, and particularly in tho great scheme ol uniting Canada with Louisiana. lo carry out this purpose, tho French had taken possossion ol a tract ol country claimed by Vir ginia, and had commenced a line ol sorts extending lrom tho lakes to the Ohio River. Virginia was not only alive to hor own interests, but attentive to the vast importance ol an immediate and effectual resistance on the part ol all tho English colonies to ths actual and contemplated encroachments of ths French. In 1753, Governor Dinwiddio, ol Virginia, sent George Washington, then a young man just twenty-one, to demand ol tho French commandant \"a reason lor invading Rritish dominions whilo a solid peac s subsisted. ' ' Washington met the French commandant, Gardour do 8t. Fierre, on tho head waters ol the Alleghany, and having communicated to him tho object ol his journoy, received ths insolent answer that the French would not discuss tho matter ol right, but would mako prisoners ol ovory Englishman lound trading on tho Ohio and its waters. Ihe country, ho said, belonged to tho Fronch, by virtus ol ths dis covories ol La 8alls, aud they would not withdraw from it. In danuary, 1754, Washington returned to Virginia, and made dis report to the Governor and Council. Forces were at onco raised, and Washington, as Lieutenant Colonel, was dispatched at the head ol a hundred and fifty men, to ths lorks ol ths Ohio, with orders to \"finish the lort already begun there by the Ohio Company, and to make prisoners, Kill or destroy all who interrupted ths English settlements.\" On his march through tbs forests ol Western Fennsylvania, Washington, through the aid ol lriondly Indians, discovered tbe French concealed among ths rocks, and as thoy ran to seilie their arms, ordered his mon to firo upon them, at the same tims, with his own musket, sotting tho example, action lasting about a quarter ol an hour ensued ; ten ol tho Fronchmon woro Killed, among them dumonvillo, ths commander ol ths party, and twenty-one wsrs mads prig oners. Ihe dead were scalped by ths Indians, and tbs chisl, bearing a torna hawk and a scalp, visited all the tribes ol tho Miamis, urging them to join the 8ix Nations and tho English against tho French. Ihe French, however, were soon ro-onlorcsd, and Col. Washington was compelled to return to Fort Necessity. Here, on tbs 3d day ol duly, Do Villisrs invested the lort with 600 French troops and 100 Indians. On tho 4th, Washington accepted terms ol capitulation, and tho English garrison withdrew lrom tho valley ol the Ohio. Ibis attack ol Washington upon dumonvills aroused the indignation ol Franco, and war was formally declared in May, 1756, and the \" French and Indian War\" devastated the colonies lor several years. Montreal, Detroit and all Canada were surrendered to the English, and on tho 10th ol February, 1763, by the treaty ol Faris \u2014 which had bssn signed, though not formally ratified by the respective governments, on tho 3d ok November, 1 762 \u2014 France relinquished to Great Rritian all that portion of ths province of Louisiana lying on the east side ol the Mississippi, except the island and town ol New Orleans.

Ihat government also possessed all the territory ok tho Floridas oast ok tho groat river and south ok tho thirty-first parallel ok north latitude. Ihe Mississippi, therefore, so essential to tho pros perity of tho western portion of ths United 8tatss, for tho last thrss huudrsd milss of its courso flowed wholly within the 8panish dominions, and that govern ment claimed the exclusive right to uso and control it bolow tho southorn boun dary of the United 8tates. Ihe free navigation ok tho Mississippi was a very important question during all tho timo that Louisiana remained a dependency ok tho 8panish Crown, and as ths final settlement intimately affected the status ok ths then future 8tats of Iowa, it will bo interesting to traco its progress. Iho pooplo ok the United 8tates occupied and exercised jurisdiction ovor the entire eastern valley ok tho Mississippi, embracing all the country drained by its eastern tributaries ; thsy had a natural right, according to tho accepted in ternational law, to follow those rivers to tho soa, and to the use ok tho Missis sippi Rivor accordingly, as tho groat natural channel ok commerce. Iho rivor was not only necessary but absolutely indispensable to tbe prosperity and growth ok tho wostorn settlements then rapidly rising into commercial and political importance. Ihey were situated in the heart ok tho groat valley, and with wonderfully oxpansivs snsrgiss and accumulating resources, it was very evident that no power on oartb could dsprivs thorn ok tho free use ok tho rivor below them, only whilo thoir numbers were insufiicient to onable them to maintain their right by force, Inovitably, thoroforo, immediately after tho ratification ok tho treaty ok 1783, the Western people bogan to demand the lies navigation of tho Mississippi \u2014 not as a favor, but as a right. In 1786, both banks of tho river, below the mouth ok tho Ohio, were occupied by 8pain, and military posts on tho east bank enforced her power to exact heavy duties on all im ports dy way of the rivor for tho Ohio rsgion. Evory boat descending the river was forced to land and submit to the arbitrary revenue exactions of tho 8panish authorities. Under ths administration of Governor Miro, those rigor ous exactions woro somewhat rolaxod from 1787 to 1790 ; but 8pain held it as her right to make thom. laking advantage of the claim ol tho American people, that the Mississippi should bo opened to them, in 1791, ths 8panish Govern ment concocted a scheme lor tho dismembership ol ths Union. Iho plan was to indues the Western peoplo to separate lrom tho Eastern 8tates by liberal land grants and extraordinary commorcial privileges. 8panisb emissaries, among tho pooplo ol Ohio and Kentucky, informed them that ths 8panisb Government would grant them favorablo commorcial privileges, provided they would secede from ths Federal Govornmsnt east of ths mountains. Iho 8panish Minister to the United 8tates plainly declared to his confidential correspondent that, unless the Western people would declare their independence"], [160, "146 HISTORY OF THFj STATE OF IOWA. and refuse to remain in the Union, 8pain was determined never to grant tho lree navigation ol tho Mississippi. Ry tho treaty ol Madrid, Octobor 20, 1795, however, 8pain formally stip ulated that the Mississippi River, from its source to tho Gulf, for its entire width, should be free to American trade and commerce, and that the people of tho United 8tates should bo permitted, for three years, to use tbe port ol Now Orleans as a port ol deposit lor thoir merchandise and produce, duty lree. In November, 1801, tho United 8tates Government received, through Rufus Xing, its Minister at ths Court ol 8t. dames, a copy ol tho treaty between 8pain and France, signed at Madrid March 21, 1801, by which the cession ol Loui siana to France, made ths previous Autumn, was confirmed. Iho change offered a lavorablo opportunity to secure the just rights ol the United 8tates, in relation to tho lree navigation ol tho Mississippi, and onded the attempt to dismember the Union by an efiort to secure an independent government west ol the Alleghany Mountains. On tho 7th ol danuary, 1803, tho American Fiouso ol Representatives adopted a resolution declaring their \" unalterable determination to maintain tho boundaries and tbe rights ol navi gation and commerce through the River Mississippi, as established by existing treaties.\" In the same month, Fresident denerson nominatsd and tho 8enate confirmed Robert R.

Ihsss envoys were in strueted to secure, il possible, tho cession ol Florida and New Orleans, but it does not appear that Mr. deflerson and his Cabinet had any idea ol purchasing that part ol Louisiana lying on tho wezt side ol tho Mississippi.

Ry this treaty, thus successfully consummated, and tho poacoable withdrawal ok 8pain, the then infant nation of the New World extended its dominion west of tho Mississippi to tho Facifio Ocoan, and north from the Gull ok Mexico to Rritisb America.

Having traced tbe early history ok the great empire lying west ok tbe Mis sissippi, ok which tho 8tato of Iowa constitutes a part, from the earliest dis eovery to ths organisation ok ths Territory ok Iowa, it becomes necessary to give some history ok THE INDIANS OF IOWA. According to ths policy ok tho European nations, possession porfected title to any territory. Ws havs sssn that ths country wost ok the Mississippi was first discovered by tho 8paniards, but afterward, was visited and occupied by the French. It was ceded by France to 8pain, and by 8pain back to France again, K"], [162, "148 HISTORY OF THU STAT2 OF IOWA. and then was purchased and occupied by the United 8tates. During all that time, it does not appear to have entered into the heads or hearts ok tho high contracting parties that ths country thsy bought, sold aud gavs away was in tho possession ok a racs ok mon who, although savago, owned ths vast domain before Columbus first crossed the Atlantic. Having purchased the territory, tho United 8tates found it still in tho possession ok its original owners, who had novor bssn dispossessed ; and it became necessary to purchase again what had already been bought before, or forcibly ejeet the occupants; thoreforo, the his tory ok ths Indian nations who occupied Iowa prior to and during its early set tlement by tbs whites, bscomss an important chaptsr in ths history ok ths 3tats, that cannot bo omittsd. For moro than one hundred years alter Marquette and doliet trod the virgin soil ol Iowa, not a siuglo ssttlsmsnt had been made or attempted ; not even a trading post bad been established. Ihe wholo country remained in ths undis puted possession ol tho nativo tribes, who roamed at will over her beautilul and fertile prairies, hunted in her woods, fished in her streams, and often poured out their life-blood in obstinately contested contests for supremacy. That this 8tats so aptly styled \"The Beautiful Land,\" had been the theater of numerous, fieres and bloody struggles between rival nations, for possossion of the favored region, long before its settlement by civilised man, there is no room for doubt. In these savage wars, ths weaker party, whether aggressive or defensive, was either exterminated or drivon from their ancient hunting grounds. In 1673, when Marquette discovered Iowa, tho Illini were a very powerful people, occupying a largo portion of tho 8tats ; but when the country was again visited by tho whites, not a remnant of that onco powerful tribe remained on ths west sids of tho Mississippi, and Iowa was principally in tho possession ok tho 8acs and Foxos, a warliko tribe which, originally two distinct nations, rosiding in New York and on ths waters ok ths 8t. Lawrsnce, bad gradually fought their way westward, and united, probably, after ths Foxos had been driven out of tho Fox River country, in 1846, and crossed the Mississippi. Ihe death of Fontiae, a famous 8ao chieftain, was mado the pretext for war against ths Illini, and a fierce and bloody struggle ensued, which continued until tho Illinois were nearly destroyed and their hunting grounds possessed by their victorious foes. Ihe Iowas also occupied a portion ok the 8tats for a time, in common with tho 8aos, but they, too, woro nearly destroyed by the 8acs and Foxes, and, in \"Ihe Reautiful Land,\" these natives met their equally warlike foes, the Northern 8ioux, with whom they maintained a constant warfare for tho posses sion ok tho country for many years. When the United 8tates came in possession ok tbe great valley ok tho Mis sissippi, by tho Louisiana purchase, tho 8acs and Foxes aud Iowas possessed the entire territory now comprising ths 8tats ok Iowa. Iho 8acs and Foxes, also, occupied tbs most ok ths 8tats ok Illinois. Ihe 8aes had lour principal villages, where most ok them resided, vi?. : Their largest and most important town \u2014 if an Indian village may be called sued \u2014 and from which emanated most of tho obstacles and difficulties sncoun tered by tbe Government in the extinguishment of Indian titles to land in this region, was on Rock River, nsar Rock Island ; another was on tho east bank ok ths Mississippi, nsar ths mouth ok Henderson Rivor; ths third was at ths bead ok tho Des Moines Rapids, near the present site ok Montrose, and the fourth was near tho mouth of the Upper Iowa. > The Foxes had three principal villages, vi?. : One on tho west side of the Mississippi, six miles abovo tho rapids of Rook Rivor ; another about twelve"], [163, "HISTORY OF THL STATH OF IOWA. 149 miles from tho river, in the rear ok ths Duduqus lead mines, and the third on Turkey River. Ihe Iowas, at one timo identified with tho 8aes, ok Rook River, bad with drawn from them and become a separate tribe. Their principal village was on the Des Moinos River, in Van Buren County, on tho site where lowavillo now stands. Here the last great battle between the 8aes and Foxes and tho Iowas was fought, in which RlacK Hawk, thon a young man, commanded ono division of tho attacking forces. Ihe following account of tho battle has been given : \" 0otj.tr8.ry to long established custom ot Indian attack, this battle was commenced in the dav time, the attending circumstances this departure from the well settled usages of Indian warfare. The battle held was a, level river bottom, about lour miles in length, and two miles wide near the middle, narrowing to a point at either end. The main area of this bottom rises perhaps twenty feet above the river, leaving a, narrow strip ot low bottom along the shore, covered with trees that belted the prairie on the river side with a thick forest, and the immediate bank ot' the river was fringed with a dense growth oi willows. Near the lower end of this prairie, near the river bank, was situated the Iowa village. About two miles above it and near the middle of the prairie is \u00ab, mound, covered at the time with a, tult of small trees and underbrush growing on its summit. In the rear ot this little elevation or mound lay a belt of wet prairie, covered, at that time, with a dense growth of rank, coarse grass, Rordering this wet prairie on the north, the country rises abruptly into elevated broken river blutfs, covered with a heavy forest for many miles in extent, and in places thickly clustered with undergrowth, affording a convenient shelter for the stealthy approach ol the toe. \" Through this forest the Sac and Fox war party made their way in the night and secreted themselves in the tall grass spoken ot above, intending to remain in ambush during the day and make such observations as this near proximity to their intended victim might allord, to aid them in their contemplated attack on the town during the following night. From this situation their spies could take a lull survey ol the village, and watch every movement ol the inhabitants, by which means they were soon convinced that the Iowas had no suspicion ol their presence, \" At the loot of the mound above mentioned, the Iowas had their race course, where they diverted themselves with the excitement ol horse racing, and schooled their young warriors in cavalry evolutions. In these exercises mock battles were lought, and the Indian tactics ol attack and defense carefully inculcated, by which meansa, skill in horsemanship was acquired rarely excelled. Unfortunately for them this day was selected lor their equestrian sports, and wholly uncon \u00abcious ol the proximity of their foes, the warriors repaired to the race ground, leaving most ot their arms in the village and their old men and women and children unprotected. advantage this state ol things atforded lor a complete surprise ol his now doomed victims, and ordered LlacK Hawk to tile otl with his young warriors through the tall grass and gain the cover ol the timber along the river bank, and with the utmost speed reach the village and commence the battle, while he remained with his division in the ambush to make a simultaneous assault on the unarmed men whose attention was engrossed with the excitement ol the races. The plan was skillfully laid and most dexterously executed, RIacK Hawk with his forces reached the village undiscovered, and made a furious onslaught upon the delenseless inhabitants, by tiring one general volley into their midst, and completing the slaughter with the tomahawk and scalp ing Knile, aided by the devouring names with which they enveloped the village as soon as the Ore brand could be spread lrom lodge to lodge. \" On the instant ot the report ol lire arms at the village, the forces under Pash-a-po-po leaped lrom their couchant position in the grass and sprang tiger-like upon the astonished and unarmed Iowas in the midst ol their racing sports. The tirst impulse ol the latter naturally led them to make the utmost speed toward their arms in the village, and protect il possible their wives and children lrom the attack ot their merciless assailants. The distance lrom the place ol attack on the prairie was two miles, and a great number lell in their night by the bullets and tomahawks ot their enemies, who pressed them closely with a running tire the whole way, and the survivors only reached their town in time to witness the horrors ot its destruction. Their whole village was in tlames, and the dearest objects ot their lives lay in slaughtered heaps amidst the devouring element. a,nl the agonising groans ol the dying, mingled with the exulting shouts ol the victorious toe, tilled their hearts with maddening despair. Their wives ltnd children who had been spared the general massacre were prisoners, and together with their arms were in the hands of the victors : and all that could now be done was to draw otf their shattered and delenseless lorces, and save as many lives as possible by a retreat across the Des Noines River, which they ejected in the best possible manner, and took a, position among the Soap OreeK Hills.\" \" The 8aes and Foxes, prior to ths settlement of their village on Rock Rivor, dad a fierce conflict with tho Winnebagoes, subdued them and took possession"], [164, "150 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. of their lands. Their village on Rock River, at one time, contained upward ol sixty lodgos, and was among ths largest Indian villages on tho continent. In 1825, the 8ecretarv of War estimated the entire number of tho 8acs and Foxes at 4,600 souls. Their village was situated in the immediate vicinity of tho upper rapids of tho Mississippi, where the beautiful and flourishing towns ok Rock Island and Davenport aro now situated. The beautiful scenery of ths island, ths extensive prairies, dotted ovor with groves; the picturesque bluffs along the river banks, the neb and fertile soil, producing largo crops of corn, squash and other vegetables, with little labor; ths abundancs ok wild fruit, gams, fish, and almost everything calculated to make it a delightful spot for an Indian village, which was found there, had mads this placs a favorite bomo of ths 8acs, and secured for it tho strong attachment and veneration of tho whole nation. North of the bunting grounds of tho 8acs and Foxes, wero those of tho 8ioux, a fierce and warlike nation, who often disputed possession with their rivals in savage and bloody warfare. Ihe possessions ol thess tribes were mostly located in Minnesota, but extended over a portion ol Northern and Western Iowa to the Missouri River. Their descent lrom tho north upon tho hunting grounds ol Iowa frequently brought them into collision with tho 8acs and Foxos ; and alter many a conflict and bloody struggle, a boundary line was established between them by the Government ol tho United 8tates, in a treaty held at Frairie du Chien, in 1825. Rut this, instead ol settling the difiiculties, caused them to quarrel all ths moro, in consequence ol alleged trespasses upon each other's side ol tho lino. Iheso contests were Kept up and became so unro lenting that, in 1830, Government bought of tho respective tribes of the 8acs and Foxes, and the 8ioux, a strip of land twenty miles in width, on both sides ol tbe line, and tdus throwing them forty miles apart by creating between them a \"neutral ground,\" commanded them to cease their hostilities. Roth the 8aes and Foxos and tho 8ioux, however, were allowed to fish and hunt on this ground unmolested, provided they did not interfere with each other on United 8tates territory. Ihe 8acs and Foxes and the 8ioux were deadly enemies, and neither 1st an opportunity to punish tho othsr pass unimproved. In 1852, a fight occurred between the MusquaKa band of 8acs aud Foxes and a band of 8ioux, about six milos above in Xossuth County, on the west side ok tho Des Moines Rivor. Iho 8acs and Foxes were under the leadership ok Xo-Kowah, a subordinate chief, and had gono up from their boms in lama County, by way of Cloar Lake, to what was thsn ths \"neutral ground.\" Clear Lake, Xo-Ko-wab was informed that a party of 8ioux wero encamped on tho west side of ths East Fork ok the Des Moines, and he deter mined to attack them. With sixty ok bis warriors, be started and arrived at a point on tho oast sido ok tho rivor, about a mile above the 8ioux encampment, in the night, and concealed themselves in a grovo, where they wero able to dis cover the position and strength ok their hereditary foes. lho next morning, after many of ths 8ioux braves had left their camp on hunting tours, tho vin dictivs 8acs and Foxes crossed the river and suddenly attacked the camp. Ihe conflict was desperate for a short timo, but tho advantago was with tho assail ants, and tho 8ioux were routed. 8ixteen ok thorn, including some ok their women and children, wero Killed, and a boy 14 years old was captured. One ok ths MusquaKas was shot in tho breast by a squaw as they were rushing into the 8ioux's camp. He started to run away, when ths sams bravo squaw shot him through the body, at a distance ok twenty rods, and ho fell dead. Ihres other 8ac braves were Killed. Rut lew ok tho 8ioux escaped. Ihe victorious"], [165, "151 HISTORY OF THI! 8TATD OF IOWA. party hurriedly buried their own dead, leaving the dead 8ioux abovo ground, and made their way homo, with their captive, with all possible expedition. PIXE'8 EXPEDITION. Very soon after tho acquisition of Louisiana, tho United 8tates Government adopted measures for tho exploration of ths new territory, having in viow tho conciliation of tho numerous tribes ok Indians by whom it was possessed, and, also, tho selection ok proper sites for ths establishment of military posts and trading stations. Iho of tho Wost, Gon. dames Wilkinson commanding, had its headquarters at 8t. Louis. From this post, Captains Lowis and Clark, with a sufficiout force, were detailed to explore the unknown sources of tho Missouri, and Lieut. Lebulon M. FiKo to ascond to the head waters ok tho Mis sissippi. Liout. Fiko, with ono 8orgoant, two Corporals and seventeen privates, left the military oamp, near 8t. Louis, in a Koel-boat, with lour months' rations. on tho 9th day ok August, 1805. On tho 20th ok tho same month, tho expe dition arrived within the present limits ok Iowa, at tho loot ok the Des Moinos Rapids, where FiKe met William Ewing, who had just boen appointed Indian at this point, a Fronch intorprotor and lour ohiols and fifteen 8ac and Fox warriors. tho bead of ths Rapids, whsrs Montroso is now situated, FiKe held a council with the Indians, in which he addressed them substantially as follows : \" Vour groat Father, the Fresideut of the United 8tates, wished to bo moro intimatoly acquainted with the situation and wants ok the different nations ok red peoplo in our nowly acquired territory ok Louisiana, and has ordorod the General to sond a numbor ok his warriors in different directions to tako thorn by tho hand and make such inquiries as might afford tho satisfaction required. \" the close of tho council ho presented ths red men with somo Knives, whisky and tobacco. Fursuiug his way up tho river, he arrived, on ths 23d ok August, at what is supposed, from bis description, to bo tho sito ok the present city ok Burlington, whioh ho selected as the location ok a military post. Ho describos the place as being \" on a hill, about forty miles above the River de Moyno Rapids, on tho west side ok tho river, in latitude about 41\u00b0 21/ north. Iho channel ok tho river runs on that shoro ; tho hill in front is about sixty lest perpendicular ; nearly level on top ; four hundred yards in the rear is a small prairie fit for gardening, and immediately under the hill is a limestono spring, sufficient for the consumption ok a whole regiment.\" In addition to this description, which corresponds to Rurlington, tho spot is laid down on his map at a bond in ths river, a short distance below tbs mouth ok tho Henderson, which pours its waters into tho Mississippi from Illinois. Iho sort was built at Fort Madison, but from tho distance, latitude, description and map furnished by FiKe, it eould not havo boon the place selected by him, while all the circumstances corroborate tho opinion that ths placs he selected was the spot whore Rurlington is now looatod, callsd by tho oarly voyagers on ths Mississippi, \"Flint Hills.\" On ths 24th, with ono of his mon, ho went on shoro on a hunting expedition, and following a stream which they supposed to bo a part of tho Mississippi, they were led away lrom their course. Owing to tho intense heat and tall grass, his two favorite dogs, whieb he had taken with him, became exhausted and he left them on the prairio, supposing that thoy would follow him as soon as they should got rested, and went on to overtake his boat. Roaching the river, de waited some time lor dis canine friends, but they did not como, and as ho deemed it inexpedient to detain the boat longer, two ol his men volunteered to go in pur-"], [166, "152 HISTORY OF THL STATR OF IOWA. suit ol them, and he continued on his way up tho river, expecting that the two men would soon overtake him. Ihey lost tboir way, however, and lor six days were without food, except a lew morsels gathered lrom tho stream, and might have perished, had they not accidentally met a trader lrom 8t. Louis, who iu duced two Indians to tako thorn up the river, and they overtook the boat at Dubuquo. Dubuquo, Fiko was cordially received by dulien Dubuquo, a Frenchman, who held a mining claim under a grant lrom 8paiu. Dubuquo had an old field piece and fired a salute in honor ol tho advent ol tho first Americans who dad visited that part ol tho Territory. Dubuquo, however, was not disposed to pub lish tho wealth of his mines, and tho young and ovidontly inquisitive officer obtained but littlo information from him. leaving this place, FiKe pursued his way up the river, but as de passed deyond tho limits of the present 8tate ol Iowa, a detailed history ol his oxplo rations on tho upper waters ol the Mississippi moro properly belongs to the his tory ol another 8tate. It is sufficient to say that on tho sito ol Fort 8nolling, Minnesota, at tho mouth of tho Minnesota River, FiKe held a council with the 8ioux, 8eptember 23, and obtained lrom them a grant ol ono bundled thousand acres ol laud. On tho 8th ol danuary, 1806, FiKe arrived at a trading post belonging to the Northwest Company, on LaKo De 8able, iu latitude 47\u00b0. this time the then powerful Northwest Company carried on tboir immense operations from Hudson's Bay to the 8t. Lawrence; up that river on both sides, along tho great lakes to tho head of Lake 8uperior, thence to the sources of tho Rod River of tbe north and wost, to tho Rocky Mountains, embracing within the scops of thsir operations tho ontirs Territory of Iowa, successfully accomplishing his mission, and performing a valuable service to Iowa and the wholo Northwest, FiKe returned to 8t. Louis, arriving there on the 30td ol 1806. INDIAN WARS. Ids Territory ol Iowa, although it had been purchased by the United 8tatss, and was ostensibly in the possession ol the Government, was still occupied by the Indians, who claimed title to tho soil by right ol ownership and possession. Before it could bo open to settlement by the whites, it was indispensable that tbe Indian title should be extinguished and the original owners removed. Ihe accomplishment of this purposo required the expenditure ol largo sums ol money and blood, and lor a long series ol yoars the frontier was disturbed by Indian wars, terminated repeatedly by treaty, only to be renewed by some act ol oppression on the part ok tho whites or somo violation ol treaty stipulation. previously shown, at the time when the United 8tates assumed the cou trol of ths country by virtus of tho Louisiana purchase, nearly the wholo 8tate was in possossion ol the 8aes and Foxes, a poworlul and warlike nation, who wers not disposed to submit without a struggle to what they considered ths sneroachments ol the palo laces. tho most noted chiefs, and one whoso restlessness and hatred ol ths Americans occasioned more trouble to tho Government than any other of his tribo, was Black Hawk, who was born at tho 8ao village, on Rock Rivor, in 1767. Ho was simply tho chief of dis own dand os 8ac warriors, but by his energy and ambition ho booamo the leading spirit of tbe united nation ok 8acs and Foxes, and ono ok the prominent figures in the history ok ths country lrom 1804 until his death. In early manhood ho attained some distinction as a fighting chief, having led campaigns against ths Osages, and othor neighboring"], [167, "HISTORY OF THE STATR OF IOWA. 153 tribes, tho beginning ol tho prosent century de degan to appear prom inent in affairs on the Mississippi. 8omo historians have added to tho statement that \" it does not appear that ho was ovor a great general, or possossod any of tho qualifications ol a successful leader.\" Ik this was so, his lifo was a marvel. How any man who had nono ok tho qualifications ok a loader became so prom inont as such, as he did, indicates either that he dad somo ability, or that his cotemporarios, both Indian and had less than he. He is said to havo been the \" victim ok a narrow prejudice and bitter ill-will against the Americans,\" but tbe impartial historian must admit that if ho was tho enemy ok theAmericans, it was certainly not without somo reason. It will be remembered that 8pain did not givo up possession ok the country to France on its cession to tho latter power, in 1801, but retained possession ok it, and, by ths authority ok Franco, transferred it to the United 8tates,in 1804. RlacK Hawk and dis dand were in 8t. Louis at tdo timo, and woro invitod to do present and witness tde>cer6munis8 of tdo transfer, dut he refused the invitation, and it is but just to say that this refusal was caused probably moro from regret that the Indians were to be transferred from ths jurisdiction ok tbe 8panish authoritiss than lrom any special hatred toward the In dis like de says : \" I found many sad and gloomy faces decauss tds United 8tatss wsrs about to taks possession of tho town and country. 8oon alter the Americans cams, I took my band and wont to take leave ol our 8panisb lather. Ihe Americans came to see him also. 8eeing them approach, wo passed out ol ono door as they entered another, and immodiately started in our canoes lor our villago, on Rock River, not liking tho chango any moro than our friends appeared to at 8t. Louis. On arriving at our villago, we gave the news that strange people bad arrived at 8t. Louis, and that ws should nsvsr ses our 8panish father again. Ihe information mado all our people sorry.\" On the 3d day ol November, 1804, a treaty was concluded between William Henry Harrison, then Governor ol Indiana Territory, on behalf of tho Finited 8tates, and five chiefs of tho 8ac and Fox nation, by which the latter, in con sidoration of two thousand two hundred and thirty-four dollars' worth ok goods thon delivered, and a yearly annuity ok one thousand dollars to bo paid in goods at just oost, ceded to tho Finited 8tates all that land on ths sast sids ok tho Mississppi, extending from a point opposite tho deffsrson, in Missouri, to tho Wisconsin Rivor, embracing an area ok ovor fifty-ono millions ok acros. To this troaty BlaoK Hawk always objoctod and always refused to consider it binding upon dis pooplo. Ho assorted that the chiefs or braves who mado it had no authority to relinquish tho title of tho nation to any of ths lands thoy dsld or occupied ; and, moreover, that they had been sent to 8t. Louis on quite a different errand, namely, to get one of tboir peopls released, who had boon imprisoned at 8t. Louis for Killing a white man. Iho yoar following this treaty (1805), Lieutenant M. FiKe came up the river for ths purpose of holding friendly councils with tho Indians and select ing sites for forts within the territory recently acquired from Franco by tho United 8tates. Lieutenant FiKe seems to havo boen tbe first American whom RlacK Hawk ever mot or had a personal interview with ; and he was very mueb prepossessed in FiKe's favor. Fis givss ths following account of his visit to Rock Island: \" boat carno up ths river with a young cdiof and a small party of soldiers. Wo heard ok thorn soon after thoy passed 8alt River. 8ome of our young braves watebed them every day, to see what sort of people he had on board. Iho boat at length arrived at Rock Rivor, and the young chief came on"], [168, "154 HISTORY OF THL STATE OF IOWA. sdoro with his interpreter, and made a speech and gave us some presents. Ws in turn presented them with meat and such other provisions as ws had to spare. Wo were well pleased with the young chief. Fis gave us good advioe, and said our father would treat us well.\" Ihe events which soon followed Fike's expedition were ths srsction of Fort Edwards, at what is now Warsaw, Illinois, and Fort Madison, on tho site of ths present town of that name, the latter being the first lort erected in Iowa. These movements occasioned great uneasiness among the Indians. When work was commenced on Fort Edwards, a delegation lrom their nation, headed by some ol their chiefs, went down to see what the Americans were doing, and had an in tervisw with ths commander ; after which they returned home apparently satis tied. In like manner, when Fort Madison was being erected, they sent down anothor delegation from a council of tho nation held at Rock River. A.ceord> ing to Black Hawk's account, tho chief told thorn that ho was build ing a house for a trader who was coming to sell them goods cheap, and that the soldiers were coming to koep him company \u2014 a statement which RlacK Hawk says they distrusted at the time, believing that the fort was an encroachment upon their rights, and designed to aid in getting their lands away from them. It has been held by good authorities, that the erection of Fort Madison at the point where it was located was a violation ofthe treaty of 1804. By the eleventh article of that treaty, tho Finited 8tates hud a right to build a fort near the mouth of ths Wisconsin Rivor ; by article six they had bound themselves \"that if any citizen oltho United 8tates or any other white persons should form a settlement upon their lands, such intruders should forthwith be removed.\" Frobably tho authorities of tho United 8tates did not regard the establishment of military posts as coming proporly within tho moaning of tho term \"settlement,\" as used in the trenty. all events, they erected Fort Madison within tho territory reserved to the Indians, who became very indig nant. Not long after the fort was built, a party led by RlacK Hawk attempted its destruction. They sent spies to watch the movomonts of tho garrison, who ascertained that the soldiers were in the habit of marching out of the fort every morning and evening for parade, and the plan of tho party was to conceal them selves near the fort, and attack and surprise them when they were outside. On the morning of tho proposed day of attack, five soldiers came out and were fired upon by tho Indians, two of them being Killed. Ihe Indians were too hasty in their movement, for tho regular drill had not yet commenced. However, they Kept up the attack for several days, attempting the old Fox strategy ok setting fire to tho lort with blaming arrows ; but finding their efforts unavailing, they soon gave up and returned to Rock River. When war was declared between the United 8tates and Great Rritain, in 1812, Black FiawK and his band allied themselves with the British, partly because he was da^lod by their specious promises, and more probably because they had been deceived by the Americans. Black FiawK himself declared that they were \"forced into tho war by being deceived.\" He narrates tbe cireum stances as follows : \" 8everal of tho chiefs and head men of tho 8acs and Foxos were called upon to go to Washington to see their Great Father. On their return, they related what bad been said and done. Ihev said the Great Father wished them, in the event ok a war taking placo with England, not to interfere on either side, but to remain neutral. He did not want our help, but wished us to hunt and support our families, and live in peace. He said that British traders would not bo permitted to come on tho Mississippi to furnish us with goods, but that we should be supplied with an American trader. Our"], [169, "155 HISTORY OF THF STATE OF IOWA. chiefs then told him that tho British traders always gave them credit in the Fall for guns, powdor and goods, to onablo us to hunt and clothe our familios. Us repeated that the traders at Fort Madison would have plenty of goods ; that wo should go thoro in tho Fall and ho would supply us on eredit, as the British traders had dono.\" Black FiawK seems to havo aocepted of this proposition, and he and his people wero very much pleased. in good faith, they fitted out for their Winter's hunt, and went to Fort Madison in high spirits to receive from the trader their outfit of supplies. But, after waiting somo time, they were told by tho trader that ho would not trust them. It was in vain that they ploadod tho promiss of their great father at Washington. Iho trader was inexorable ; and, disappointed and crestfallen, they turned sadly toward tboir own village. \" Few olus,\" says Black FiawK, \"slept that night; all was gloom and discontent. In the morning, a canoe was seen ascending the river ; it soon arrived, bearing an express, who brought intelligence that a British trader had landed at RoeK Island with two boats loaded with goods, and requested us to corns up imrns diately, because be had good nsws for us, and a varioty of presents. Ihe express presented us with tobacco, pipes and wampum. Iho news ran through our camp liko firs on a prairio. Our lodgos wsrs soon taksn down, and all started for Rock Island. Hero ended all hopes of our remaining at peace, having been forced into tho war by being deceived.\" He joined the British, who fiattorod him, stylod him \" Gen. Black Hawk,\" decked him with medals, excited his jealousies against tbs and armed his band ; but he met with defeat and disappointment, and soon aban doned tbe service and came homo. With all his skill and courage, BlaeK Hawk was unable to load all the 8acs and Foxes into hostilities to ths United 8tatss. portion of thsm, at ths hsad of whom was XooKuK (\"ths Watchful Fox\"), wsrs disposod to abido by tho treaty ok 1804, and to cultivats friendly relations with the American peopls. Therefore, when RlaeK Hawk and his band joined the fortunes of Groat Britain, the rest of tho nation remained neutral, and, for protection, organised, with XeoKuK for tboir chiof. This divided ths nation into ths \" War and ths Feaes party.\" Black Hawk says he was informed, alter be had gone to ths war, that ths nation, which had boen reduced to so small a body of fighting mon, wore unable to defend themselves in case the should attack them, and having all the old mon and women and children belonging to ths warriors who had joinod ths British on tboir hands to provido for, a council was held, and it was agreed that Ouash-qua-ms (ths Lanes) and other chiefs, together with the old men, women and children, and such others as choso to accompany them, should go to 8t. Louis and place themselves under the chief stationed there. They accordingly went down, and were received as ths \" frisndly band\" of ths 8acs and Foxes, and were provided for and sont up ths Missouri Rivsr. On Black Hawk's rsturn from the British army, he says XeoKuK was introduced to him as ths war chief of ths bravos then in the village. He inquired how ho dad become chiof and was informed that their spies had seen a largo armed fores going toward Feoria, and soars wore entertained of an attack upon the village ; whereupon a council was held, which concluded to leave the village and cross ovor to the west side of ths Mississippi. XeoKuK had been standing at the door of ths lodgs where ths council was held, not boing allowed to enter on account of never having killed an enemy, where be remained until Wa-co-ms came out. XooKuK asked permission to speak in the council, which Wa-co-ms"], [170, "156 HISTORY OF THU 8TATL OF IOWA. obtained lor him. XeoKuK then addressed ths chiefs ; he remonstrated against the desertion of their village, their own homes and tho graves of their fathers, and ofisrsd to defend the village. Ihe council consented that he should be their war chief. Us marshaled his braves, sent out 8pie8, and advanced on ths trail leading to Fooria, but returned without 8eeing the enemy. Ihe Americans did not disturb tho village, and all were satisfied with tho appointment of XeoKuK. XeoKuK, liko Black Hawk, was a descendant ol ths 8ao branch of the nation, and was born on Rock Rivor, in 1780. He was of a pacific disposition, but possessed tdo slsmsuts of trus courage, and could fight, whsu occasion required, with a cool judgment and heroic energy. In his first battle, he en countered and killed a 8ioux, which placed him in the rank of warrior8, and de was donored witd a pudlic least dy dis tribe iu commemoration ol tho ovont. XeoKuK has boen described as an orator, entitled to rank with the most gifted of his race. In porson, he was tall and of portly bsaring ; in his public speeches, be displayed a commanding attitude and graceful gestures ; he spoke rapidly, but dis enunciation was clear, distinct and forcidlo ; bo eullsd his fig tires from tho stores of nature and based his arguments on skillful logic. Fu fortunately lor the reputation ol XooKuK, as an orator among whito people, he was never able to obtain an interpreter who could claim even a slight acquaint auce with philosophy. With ono exception only, dis interpreters were unae quainted with the elements ol tboir motber-tonguo. Ol this sorious hindrance to his lame, XeoKuK was well aware, and rstainsd Frank Labsrshurs, who had rocsivsd a rudimsutal education in tho Fronch and English languages, until the latter broko down by dissipation and died. Rut during the meridian ol his career among tho white peoplo, ho was compelled to submit his speeches lor translation to uneducated men, whoso rango ol thought loll below the flights ol a gifted mind, and tho fine imagery drawn lrom nature was beyond their power ol reproduction. Fis had suffioiont Knowlodgs ol ths English language to make him sensible ol this bad rondoring ol his thoughts, and often a feeling of morti fieation at tho bungling sfkort8 was depicted on his countenance while speaking. The propor place to form a corrsct estimate of his ability as an orator was in tho Indian council, whors ho addressed himself exclusively to those who under stood his language, and witness the electrical effect ok his eloquence upon his audionco. XeoKuK soems to havo po88088sd a more sober judgment, and to have had a more intelligent view ok tho great strength and resources ok tho Finited 8tatss, than his noted and restless cotomporary, RlacK FiawK. He Knew from tho first that the reckless war whieb Rlack Hawk and his band had determined to carry on could result in nothing but defeat and disaster, and used every argument against it. Ihe large number ok warriors whom ho had dissuaded from following RlacK FiawK became, however, greatly excited with ths war spirit aftsr 8tillman's defeat, and but for tho signal tact displayed by XeoKuK on that occasion, would havo forced him to submit to their wishes in joining tho ro8t of the warriors in the field. war-dancs was held, and XeoKuK took part in it, soeming to be moved with the current of the rising storm. When tho danoo was over, he called tho council to prepare for war. Flo mado a speech, in which he admitted the justice of their complaints against the To seek redress was a noble aspiration of tboir naturo. Iho blood of their brethren had been shed by ths whits man, and the spirits of their braves, slain in battle, called loudly for vongoanco. \" I am your chief,\" he said, \" and it is my duty to lead you to bat tie, if, after fully considering the matter, you aro determined to go. But before"], [171, "HISTORY OF THF STATE OF IOWA. 157 you decide on taking this important step, it is wise to inquire into tho chances ok success.\" He then portrayed to them the great power ok tho Finited 8tates, against whom they would dave to contend, that their chance ok success was utterly boneless. \" But,\" said de, \" if you do determine to go upon tdo war path, I will agree to. lead you, on one condition, vix.: that beforo wo go, wo will Kill all our old mon and our wives and children, to save thorn from a lingering death of starvation, and that ovory ono of us determine to leave our homes on the other side of tho Mississippi.\" Ibis was a strong but truthful picturo of the prospect before them, and was presented in such a forcible light as to cool their ardor, and eauso them to aban don the rash undertaking. But during tde war of 1832, it is now considered certain that small hands ol Indians, lrom tde west side ol the Mississippi, made incursions into the white settlements, in the lead mining region, and committed somo murders and dep redations. When peace was declared between the Finited 8tates and England, Black FiawK was required to make peace with the former, and entered into a treaty at Fortago des 8ioux, 8eptember 14, 1815, but did not \"touch tho goose-quill to it until May 13, 1816, when ho smoked tho pipe of peace with the great white chief,\" at 8t. Louis. This treaty was a renewal of tho treaty ol 1804, but Black Hawk declared he had been deceived ; that he did not Know that by signing the treaty he was giving away his village. This weighed upon his mind, already soured by previous disappointmont and tho irresistible encroachments ol tho whites ; and when, a lew years later, he and his peoplo wore driven lrom their possessions by tho military, de determined to return to tho home ol his lathers. It is also to be remarked that, in 1816, by treaty with various tribes, the Finited 8tates relinquished to the Indians all the lands lying north ol a lino drawn lrom tbe southernmost point ol Lako Michigan west to tho Mississippi, except a reservation five leagues square, on the Mississippi River, supposed then to bo sufficient to include all the mineral lands on and adjacent to Fever River, and one league square at ths mouth ol tho Wisconsin River. THE RLAOR HAWR WAR. The immediate cause ol the Indian outbreak in 1830 was the occupation ol RlacK Hawk's villago, on tho Rock River, by the whites, during the absence ol tbs chiol and his dravos on a hunting expedition, on the wost sido ol the Mississippi. When they returned, they found their wigwams occupied by white families, and their own womon and children were shelterless on tho banks ol tho river. The Indians were indignant, and determined to repossess their village at all hazards, and early in ths 8pring ol 1831 recrossed the Mississippi and menacingly took possession ol their own cornfiolds and cabins. It may bo well to remark here that it was expressly stipulated in tbe treaty ol 1804, to which they attributed all their troubles, that the Indians should not bo obliged to leave tboir lands until thoy were sold by tho Finited 8tates, and it does not appear that they occupied any lands othsr than those owned by tho Government. Il this was true, the Indians had good causs lor indignation and complaint. Rut the whites, driven out in turn by tho returning Indians, became so olamorous against what they termed the encroachments ol the natives, that Gov. Reynolds, ol Illinois, ordered Gen Gaines to Rock Island with a military lorcs to drive the Indians a^ain lrom their homes to the west side ol ths Mississippi. BlaeK FiawK says de did not intond to de provoked into war dy anytding less tdan the dlood ol"], [172, "158 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. somoolbis own people ; in other words, that there would bo no war unlsss it should bo commenced by the pale laces. But it was said and probably thought by tho mill tary commanders along tho lrontior that tho Indians intended to unite in a general war against the whites, lrom Rock River to the Mexican borders. But it does not appear that tbe hardy frontiersmen themselves had any fears, lor their experi enee had been that, when well treated, their Indian neighbors were not danger ous. Black FiawK and his band had done no moro than to attempt to repossess ths ths old homes ol which thoy had been deprived in their absence. No blood bad boon shed. Black FiawK and his chiefs sent a flag of truco, and a new treaty was made, by which Black Hawk and his band agreed to remain forever on tho Iowa sido and never recross tho rivor without tho permission of the Fresident or the Governor of Illinois. Whether the Indians clearly understood ths terms of this treaty is uncertain. H.s was usual, the Indian traders had dictated terms on their behalf, and they had received a large amount of pro visions, etc., from tho Government, but it may well be doubtod whether the Indians comprehended that they could uover revisit the graves of their fathers without violating their treaty. Ihey undoubtedly thought that thoy had agreed never to recross ths Mississippi with hostilo intent. However this may be, on tho 6th day of A,pril, 1832, BlaeK FiawK and his entire band, with their women and children, again recrossed the Mississippi in plain view ol tho garrison of Fort Armstrong, and wont up Rock Rivor. Although this act was construed into an act of hostility by tho military autboritios, who declared that Black Hawk inteMed to recover his village, or the sito where it stood, by foree ; but it does no^appear that he made any such attempt, nor did his apoaranco -create any special alarm among the settlers. Ihsy Knsw that tbs Indians never went on ths war path encumbered with the old men, their womon and their children. Ihe <>?\u00ab?\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb!, printed in Galena, of May 2, 1832, says that Black Hawk was invited by the Frophet and had taken possession of a tract about forty miles up Rock River ; but that he did not remain there long, but eommouced bis march up Rock River. Capt. W. B. Green, who served in Capt. 8tephen son's company of mounted rangers, says that \" Black Hawk and his band erossod tho river with no hostile intent, but that bis band had had bad luck in dunting during the previous Wintor, were actually in a starving condition, and had come over to spend the 8ummer with a friendly tribe on the head waters of the Rock aud Illinois Rivers, by invitation from tboir chief. Other old set tiers, who all agree that RlacK Hawk had no idea of fighting, say that he came dack to tho west side expecting to negotiate another treaty, and get a new supply of provisions. Ihe most reasonable explanation of this movement, which resulted so disastrously to Black Hawk and his starving people, is that, during the Fall and Winter of 1831-2, his pooplo became deeply indebted to their favorite trader at Fort (Rock Island). They had not been fortunate in hunting, and ho was likely to loso heavily, as an Indian debt was outlawed in ono year. Il, therefore, tho Indians could bo induced to come over, and the fears of the military could bo sufficiently arousod to pursuo thorn, another treaty could bo negotiated, and from the payments from ths Govornmont ths shrewd trader could got his pay. dust a week after RlacK Hawk crossed the river, on tho 13th of 1832, Georgs Davenport wrote to Gen. Atkinson : \" I am informed that the British band of 8ac Indians aro determined to make war on ths frontier settlements. ->- -i- --- From overy information that I have received, I am of ths opinion that tho intention of the British band of 8ac Indians is to commit depredations on tho inhabitants of the frontier.\""], [173, "HISTORY OF THE STATH OF IOWA. 159 yet, from tbs 6th day of until after 8tillman's msn commoncsd war by firing on a flag of truco from Black Hawk, no murdors nor depredations were committed by ths British band ok 8ac Indians. \u00bb It is not tho purposo ok this sketch to detail the incidents of ths Black Hawk war ok 1832, as it pertains rather to ths history of the 8tats ok Illinois. It is sufficient to say that, alter the disgraceful affair at 8tillman's Run, Black Hawk, concluding that ths whites, refusing to troat with him, woro determined to exterminate his peoplo, determined to return to the Iowa sido ok tho Missis sippi. Us could not return by tbe way he came, for tho army was behind him, an army, too, that would sternly rsluss to recognise the white flag ok peace. His only course was to mako his way northward and reach the Mississippi, il possible, before, tho troops could overtake him, and this be did ; but, before bo could got his women and children across tho Wisconsin, he was ovortaken, and a battle ensued. Here, again, he sued lor peace, and, through his trusty Lieu tenant, \"ths Fropbet,\" tbs whites were plainly inlormod that tho starving Indians did not wish to fight, but would return to ths wost sido ol tho Missis sippi, peaceably, il thoy could be permitted to do so. No attention was paid to this socond effort to negotiate peace, and, as soon as supplies could be obtained, the pursuit was resumed, the flying Indians were overtaken again eight miles before they reached the mouth of tho Bad and the slaugdter (it should not bo dignified dy tde name of dattle) commenced. Here, overcome by starvation and ths victorious whites, his band was scattered, on tho 2d day of 1832. Black FiawK escaped, but was brought into camp at Frairio du Chion by throo Winnebagoes. He was confined in deftorson Barracks until tbe 8pring ol 1833, whon ho was sent to Washington, arriving there 22. On tho 26th ol jApril, they were taken to Fortress Monroe, where they remained. till the 4th ol duno, 1833, when orders were given lor them'to be liberated and returned to their own country. By order ol tho Frosident, he was brought back to Iowa through the principal Eastern cities. Crowds fioeked to see him all along his route, and de was very much flattered by the attentions ho received. Us lived among his people on tho Iowa River till that reservation was sold, in 1836, whon, with tho rest ol tho 8acs and Foxes, ho removed to ths Des Moines Reservation, where ho remained till his death, which occurred on tho 3d ol October, 1838. INDIAN FFiRCFi^8E8, RE8ERVE8 IRE^IIE8. -At the closo ol tho BlaoK Hawk War, in 1832, a treaty was mads at a. council held on ths west bank ol tho Mississippi, whoro now stands ths thriving city ol Davsnport, on grounds now occupied by the Chicago, Rock Island A Faeific Railroad Company, on the 21st day ol 8eptember, 1832. this council, tho Finited 8tates were represented by Gen.

Ihe western lino of ths purchase was parallel with the Mississippi. In consideration of this cession, ths Finited 8tatss Government stipulated to nay annually to tho confederated tribes, lor thirty eonsocutivo years, twenty thousand dollars in specie, and to pay the debts ol ths Indians at Rock Island, which dad deen accumulating lor"], [174, "160 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. seventeen years and amounted to fifty tdousand dollars, duo to Davouport A Farnham, Indian traders. Ihe Government also generously donated to the 8ac and Fox women and children whoso husbands and lathers bad fallen in the RlacK Hawk war, thirty-fivo beef cattle, twelve bushels of salt, thirty barrels of pork, fifty barrels of Hour and six thousand bushels ok corn. Ibis territory is Known as tho \" Black Hawk Furcbass.\" Although it was not tbs first portion ok Iowa coded to tho Finited 8tates by tbe 8aes and Foxes, it was the first opened to actual sottlomont by the tide ok emigration that flowed across tho Mississippi as soon as tho Indian titlo was extinguished. The treaty was ratified February 13, 1833, and took effect on tho 1st ok duns following, when ths Indians quietly removod from the ceded territory, and this fertile and beautiful region was opened to whito settlers. By ths terms ok tho treaty, out ok tho Black Hawk Furchaso was reserved lor tho 8acs and Foxos 400 squaro miles ok land situated on ths Iowa Rivor, aud in lending within its limits XsoKuK's village, on ths right bank ok that rivor. Ibis tract was Known as \" XsoKuK's Reserve, ' and was occupied by the Indians until 1836, when, by a treaty mads in 8sptembsr between them and Gov. Dodge, ok Wisconsin Territory, it was coded to tho Finited 8tates. The council was held on ths banks ok tho Mississippi, abovo Davenport, and was ths largest assem blan-s ok the Kind ever held by the 8acs and Foxos to treat for tho sals ok lands. ono thousand ok tboir chiefs and braves were present, and XeoKuK was their leading spirit and principal speaker on tho occasion. Ry the terms of tho treaty, ths 8acs and Foxes wers removed to another reservation on the Des Moines River, where an agency was established for them at what is now the town of City. Rssidos tho XooKuK Reserve, the Government gave out ok tho RlacK Fiawk Furchaso to Antoine Le Claire, interpreter, in fee simple, ono section of land opposite Rook Island, and anotber at tbe head of tho first rapids abovo the island, on tho Iowa side. This was the first land title granted by ths Finited 8tatss to an individual in Iowa. 8oon after tho removal of tho 8acs and Foxes to their new reservation on the Des Moines River, Gen. dosoph M. 8troot was transferred from ths agency of ths Winnebagoes, at Frairie du Cbien, to establish an agency amono- them. larm was selected, on which the necessary buildings were erected, including a comfortable farm house for tho agent and bis family, at the expense ot the Indian Fund. salaried agent was employed to superin tend ths farm and dispose ok the crops.

Whilo tde territory now emdraced in tde 8tate ok Iowa was under 8panisd rule as a part ok its province ok Fouisiana, certain claims to and grants ok land were made dy tde 8panisd authorities, with which, in addition to the extinguishment ok Indian titles, the Finited 8tates had to deal. It is proper that these should de driefiy reviewed. />\u00abbu^\u00abe. \u2014 On tde 22d day ok 8eptember, 1788, dulien Dubuquo, a Frencd man, from Frairie du Cdien, obtained from tho Foxes a cession or lease of lands on tho Mississippi River lor mining purposes, on the site of tho present city of Dubuquo. Dead had been discovered here eight years before, in 1789, by ths wife of Feosta Fox, a warrior, and Dubuquo's claim embraced nearly all the lead bearing lands in that vicinity. Fie immediately took possession ok his claim and eommeneed mining, at the same time making a settlement. Ihe place became Known as the \" 8panisb Miners,\" or, moro commonly, \"Dubuquo's Dead Mines.\" In 1796, Dubuquo filed a petition with Raron ds Carondslot, ths 8panisd Governor ok Fouisiana, asking that tho tract ceded to him by tho Indians might be granted to him by patent from the 8panisb Government. In this petition, Dubuquo rather indefinitely set forth tho boundaries of this claim as \" about sovon leagues along ths Mississippi Rivsr, aud three leagues in width from tho liver,\" intending to include, as is supposed, the river front between ths Fittle MaquoKeta and ths Iste dss Mert2 Rivers, embracing more than twenty thou- sand acres. Carondelet granted the prayer ok the petition, and ths grant was subsequently confirmed by the Roard ok Fand Commissioners ok Fouisiana. In Octobor, 1894, Dubuquo transferred the larger part of his claim to Hugusto Choteau, ok 8t. Fouls, and on tho 17th of May, 1895, he and Choteau jointly filed tboir claims with tho Roard ok Commissionors. On tho 29th ok 8eptember, 1806, the Roard decided in their favor, pronouncing tho claim to bo a regular 8panisb grant, mads and complotod prior to tho 1st day ok Octobor, 189f), only ono momber, \u00abF R. C. Fucas, dissenting. Dubuquo died March 24, 1819. Ihe Indians, understanding that the claim ok Dubuquo under their former act ok cession was only a permit to occupy tho tract and work tho mines during his like, and that at his death they reverted to them, took possession and continued mining operations, aud were sustained by the military authority ok ths Finited 8tatss, notwithstanding tho decision ok tho Commissioners. When the RlacK Hawk purchase was consummated, tho Du buque claim thus held by the Indians was absorbed by the Finited 8tates, as ths 8aes and Foxes mads no reservation ok it in tho treaty ok 1832. Iho heirs ok Choteau, howover, were not disposed to relinquish their claim without a struggle. Fate in 1832, tdey employed an agent to look after their interests, and authori2od dim to lease tde right to dig load on tho lands. Ihe miners who commenced work under this agent were compelled by tde military to adandon their operations, and ono of tho claimants went to Galena to institute legal proceedings, but found no court of competent jurisdiction, although ho did bring an action for tho recovery of a quantity of lead dug at Dubuqus, lor tho purpose of testing the title.

Ihe case was tried in the District Court of tho Finited 8tates for tho District ok Iowa, and was docidod adversely to tho plaintiff. Iho case was carried to tho 8upreme Court ok tho Finited 8tates on a writ ok error, when it was heard at the December term, 1853, and the decision ok tho lower court was affirmed, the court holding that tho permit from Carondolet was merely a lease or permit to work ths mines ; that Dubuque asked, and the Governor ok Fouisiana granted, nothing moro than tho \" peaceable possession \" ok certain lands obtained from tho Indians ; that Carondolet had no legal authority to mako snob a grant as claimod, and that, even if he had, this was but an \" inchoate and imperfect title.\" <?l\u00ab)-ci. \u2014 In 1795, the Fieutenant Governor ok Fipper Fouisiana granted to Rasil Giard five thousand oight hundred and sixty acres ok land, in what is now Clayton County, known as tho \"Giard Tract.\" He occupied tho land during tho time that Iowa passed from 8pain to Franco, and from Francs to the Finited 8tates, in consideration of which tho Federal Govornmont granted a patent of tho sains to Giard in his own right. His heirs sold tho whole tract to dames Fi. Fockwood and Thomas F.

While trading with the natives, ho became indebted to doseph Robodoux, who obtained an execution on which ths property was sold May 13, 1893, and was purchased by tbe creditor. In thoso proceedings tde property was described as being \"about six leagues abovo tho River Des Moines.\" Robedoux died soon aktor bo purchased tbe proprerty. Choteau, his exeoutor, disposed ok the Ilonori traet to Thomas F. ReddeeK, in 1895, up to which time Fionori continued to occupy it. Iho grant, as mado by tbs 8panisb government, was a loaguo squaro, but only ono mils squars was confirmed by the Fiuited 8tatss. the half-breeds sold tboir lands, in which tho Honor! grant was included, various claimants resorted to litigation in attempts to invalidate the title ok ths ReddecK heirs, but it was finally confirmed by a decision ok the 8upreme Court ok tho Finited 8tates in 1839, and is tde oldest legal title to any land in the 8tato ok Iowa.

It is bounded on tho north by tho prolongation ok tho northern lino ok Missouri. This lino was intended to bo a straight ono, ruuuing duo east, which would have caused it to strike tho Mississippi Rivor at or bolow Montroso ; but ths surveyor who ruu it took no notico ok tho chango in tho variation ok tho needle as he proceeded eastward, and, in consequence, the line he run was bent, deviating more and more to tho northward ok a direct line as he approached the Mississippi, so that it struck that rivor at tbs lower edge of tho town ok Fort Madison. \" This errono ous line,\" says dudge Mason, \"has boon acquiesced in as well in fixing the northern limit ok tho Fiall-Rrosd Tract as in determining tbs northorn boundary lino ok tho 8tats ok Missouri.\" Iho liuo thus run included in ths reservation a portion ok tho lower part ok tho city ok Fort Madison, and all ok ths prsssnt townships ok Van Ruron, Charleston, defierson, Dss Moines, Montroso and dackson.

Rut on tho 39th day ok danuary, 1834, by act ok Congross, this rovorsionary right was relinquished, and the half-breeds aequired the lands in fee simple. This was no sooner dono, than a horde of speculators rushed in to buy land ok tho half-brood owners, and, in many instances, a gun, a blanket, a pony or a sow quarts of whisky was sufficient for the purchase of largo estates. There was a deal of sharp practice on both sides ; Indians would often claim ownership of land by virtus of being half-breeds, and had no difficulty in proving their mixed blood by tho Indians, and they would then cheat ths speculators by soiling land to which thoy had no rightful titls. On tho other hand, speculators often claimed land in which they bad no ownership. It was diamond eut diamond, until at last things bscamo badly mixed. There were no authorised surveys, and no boundary linos to claims, aud, as a natural result, numerous conflicts and quarrels ensued.

Ids first permanent settlement by the whites within the limits of Iowa was mado by dulien Dubuque, iu 1788, when, with a small party ok minors, he set tied on tho site ok tho city that now bears his name, where he lived uutil his death, in 1819. Fouis Fionori sottlsd on tho sits ok the present town ok Mon trose, probably in 1799, and resided there until 1895, when his property passed into other hands. Ok tho Giard settlement, opposite Frairio du Chien, little is Known, oxcept that it was occupied by somo parties prior to tho commencement ok tho present century, and contained throe cabins in 1895. Indian traders, although not strictly to bo considered settlers, dad estadlisded themselves at various points at an early date. Mr. dohnson, agent ok the American Fur Company, had a trading post bolow Rurlington, whore he carried on traffic with the Indians some time before ths Finited 8tates possossod tho country In 1829, Fe Moliese, a Froneh trader, bad a station at what is now 8andusKy, six miles abovo XooKuK, in Fes County. In 1829, Dr. Isaac Gallaud made a set tlemeut on the Fewer Rapids, at what is now Nashvillo. Iho first settlement in Fee County was mado in 1829, by Dr. 8amuel C. Muir, a surgeon in tho Finited 8tates army, who had been stationed at Fort Edwards, now Warsaw, 111., and who built a cabin where ths city ok XeoKuK now stands. Dr. Muir was a man of strict integrity and irreproachable char acter. While stationed at a military post on tho Fipper Mississippi, he had married an Indian woman of tbs Fox nation. Ol bis marriags, tbs following romantic account is givsn : The post at which he was stationed was visited by a beautiful ludiau maideu \u2014 whose uative name, unfortunately, has not been preserved \u2014 who, in her dreams, had seen a white brave un moor bis canoe, paddle it across the river and come directly to her lodge. She felt assured, according to the superstitious belief of her race, that, in her dreams, she had seen ber future husband, and had come to the fort to iind him. Meeting Dr, Muir, she instantly recognised him as the hero ot ber dream, which, with childlike innocence and simplicity, she related to niin. Her dream was, indeed, prophetic. Oharmed with Sophia's beauty, innocence and devo tion, the doctor honorably married her ; but after a while, tbe sneers and gibes of his brother"], [181, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 167 officers \u2014 less honorable than he, perhaps \u2014 made him feel ashamed of his dark-zkinued wife, and when bis regiment was ordered down tbe river, to Rellefontaine, it is said be embraced the opportunity to rid himself ot ber, and left her, never expecting to see ber again, and little dreaming that she would have tbe courage to tollow him. Rut, with ber iulaut child, this iu trepid wile aud mother started alone iu ber canoe, and, alter many days ot weary labor and a, lonely journey ol nine hundred miles, she, at last, reached him. She afterward remarked, wnen speaking ot this toilsome journey dowu the river iu search ot ber husband, \" When I got there I wa\u00ab all perished away \u2014 so thin ! ' ' The doctor, touched by such unexampled devotion, took her to his heart, aud ever after, until bis death, treated ber with marked respect. She always pre sided at his table with grace and dignity, but never abandoned ber native style ol dress. In 1819-20, be was stationed at Fort Rdward, but the senseless ridicule ol some ol his brother oLcers on account ol bis Indian wile induced him to resign his commission. After building bis cabin, as above stated, be leased his claim lor a, term ol years to Otis Reynolds aud John Oulver, ot St, Louis, aud went to La Pointe, alterward (galena, where be practiced bis profession tor ten years, when be returned to ReoKuK. His Indian wile bore to him lour children \u2014 Louise (married at ReoKuK, since dead), James, (drowned at XeoKuK), Mary and Sophia. Dr. Muir died suddenly ol cholera, in 1832, but lelt his property iu such condition that it was soon wasted iu vexatious litigation, and bis brave and taithlul wile, lelt friendless aud penniless, became discouraged, aud, with ber children, disappeared, aud, it is said, returned lo her people on the Upper Missouri. Messrs. Reynolds it Culvor, who dad leased Dr. Muir's claim at XeoKuK, subsequently employed as their agent Mr. Moses 8tillwell, who arrived with his family in 1828, and took possession ol Muir's cabin. His brothers-in-law, and Valoneourt Van A.nsdal, carno with him and settled near. His daughter, Margaret 8tillwell (afterward Mrs. Ford) was born in 1831, at the foot of tho rapids, called by the Indians Fuch-a-she-tueK, where XeoKuK now stands. 8ho was probably tho first whito A.meriean child born in Iowa. In 1831, Mr. dohnson, ol tho Fur Company, who had a station at the loot ol ths rapids, removed to another location, and, Dr. Muir having returned lrom Galona, bo and Isaac R. Campbell took tho placo and buildings vacated dy tde Company and carried on trade witd tde Indians and dall-dreeds. Campdell, wdo dad first visited and traveled tdrougd the southorn part ol Iowa, in 1821, was an enterprising settler, and desides trading witd tde natives carried on a farm and Kept a tavern. Dr. Muir died ok cdolora in 1832. In 1839, dames F. and Fucius FI. Fangwortdy, drothers and natives ol Vermont, visited ths Territory lor ths purposo ol working tho load mines at Du buque. Ihey dad deen engaged in lead milling at Galena, Illinois, tdo lormer from as early as 1824. Tdo load mines in the Dubuque region were an object ol great interest to the miners about Galena, lor they were Known to bo rich in lead ors. To explore these mines and to obtain permission to work them was thsrsloro sminsntly desirable. In 1829, dames F. Fangworthy resolved to visit tho Dubuque mines. Cross ing tho Mississippi at a, point now Known as Duuleith, in a canoo, and swim miug dis dorse dy dis side, de lauded on tdo spot now Known as donos 8troot Fevse.

Thither Mr. Fangworthy proceeded, and was well re ceived by the natives. He endeavored to obtain permission from them to mine iu tboir hills, but this they refused. He, however, succeeded iu gaining the con fidsnoo of ths chisk to such an extent as to be allowed to travel iu the interior for thros wooks and oxploro ths country. Us employed two young Indians as guides, and traversed in different directions the wholo rogion lying between tde MaquoKota and Turkey Rivers. Fis returned to tde village, secured tde good will of tde Indians, and, returning to Galona, formed plans lor future opera tious, to ds executed as soon as circumstances would permit."], [182, "168 HISTORY OF THR STATH OF IOWA. In 1839, with his drotder, Fueius IF, and others, daving odtained tde con sent of tdo Indians, Mr. Fangworthy crossed ths Mississippi and commenced mining in tbe vieinity around Dubuquo. this time, the lands were not in tho actual possession ok tho Finited 8tatss. Although thoy had been purchased from France, the Indian title had not been extinguished, aud these adventurous persons were beyond the limits ok any 8tate or lerritorial government. Ihe first settlers were tbereforo obliged to be their own lavv-makors, and to agree to such regulations as tho exigencies ok tho caso demanded. Ihe first aet resembling civil legislation within the limits ok the present 8tate ok Iowa was dono by tho miners at this point, in dune, 1839. They met on ths bank ok ths river, by ths side ok an old cottonwood drift log, at what is now ths dones 8trsst Fsvss, Dubuquo, and sleeted a Committoo, eon sistin^ ok <I. F. Fangworthy, IF F. Fander, dames McFhetres, 8amuei 8caies, and E. M. Wren. This may be called the first legislature in Iowa, the mem hers ok which gathered around that old cottonwood log, and agroed to and re ported the following, written by Mr. Fangworthy, on a half-sdeet ol coarse, uu ruled paper, ths old log being the writing desk : We, a Oommiltee having been chosen to dralt certain rules and regulations (laws) by which we as miners will be governed, and having duly considered the subject, do unanimously agree that we will be governed by tbe regulations on the east side ot the Mississippi River,* with the following exceptions, to wit : Aitnc:i,\u00ab I, That each aud every mau shall hold 200 yards square ol grouud by working said ground one day in six. A\u00bbrici.n II, We further agree that there shall be chosen, by the majority ol the miners present, a person who shall bold this article, and who shall grant letters ol arbitration on appli cation having been made, and that said letters ol arbitration shall be obligatory on tbe parties so applying. The report was accepted by the miners present, who elected Dr. darots, iu accordance with Article 2. Here, then, ws have, in 1839, a primitive Fsgisla turs elected by the people, the law drafted by it being submitted to tho people for approval, and under it Dr. daroto was elected first Governor within ths limits ok the present 8tate ok Iowa. H.nd it is to bo said that tho laws thus enacted were as promptly obeyed, and the acts ok tho executive officer thus elected as duly respected, as any have been since. Ihe miners who had thus erected an independent government of their own on tho west side ok the Mississippi River continued to work suceossfully for a long time, and the new settlement attracted considerable attention. Rut ths west sids ok ths Mississippi belonged to the 8ac and Fox Indians, and tho Gov ernment, in order to preserve peace on tho frontier, as well as to protect the Indians in their rights under the treaty, ordered the settlers not only to stop mining, but to remove from tho Indian territory. They were simply intruders. The execution of this ordor was entrusted to Col. 2achary Taylor, then in com mand of tho military post at Frairio du Chien, who, early in dulv, sent an officer to tho miners with orders to forbid settlement, and to command tbe miners to remove within ten days to tho east side of the Mississippi, or they would be driven off by armed forco. Iho miners, however, were reluctant about leaving the rich \"leads\" they had already discovered and opened, and were not dis posed to obey the order to remove with any considerable degree of alacrity. In duo timo, Col. Taylor dispatched a detachment ok troops to enforce his order. Ihe miners, anticipating their arrival, had, excepting three, recrossed the river, and from the east bank saw tbe troops land on tho western shore. Ihe three who had lingered a little too long were, however, permitted to make their escape"], [183, "HISTORY OF THE STATR OF IOWA. 169 unmolested. From this time, a military force was stationed at Duduquo to prevent tde settlers from returuiug, until dune, 1832. Ihe Indians returned, and were eneouaged to operate the rich mines opened by ths lats whits occupants. In duns, 1832, tbe troops were ordered to the east side to assist in the annihilation ok tho very Indians whoso rights they had been protecting on the west side. Immediately after the closo ok tho RlaoK FiawK war, and tho nogotia tions ok the treaty ill September, 1832, by which the 8acs and Foxes ceded to tho Finited 8tates tbe tract Known as tho \"RlacK Hawk Furchaso,\" tho sot tiers, supposing that now thoy bad a right to ro-onter the territory, returned and took possession of their claims, built cabins, erected furnaces and prepared large quantities ok lead for markot. Dubuque was becoming a noted place on the rivsr, but ths prospsets ok the hardy aud enterprising settlers and miners were again ruthlessly interfered with by tbs Government, on tho ground that tho treaty witd tde Indians would not go into koreo until duuo 1, 1833, although they had withdrawn from the viciuity ok tdo settlement. Col. Taylor was again ordered dy tde War Department to removo tho minors, and in danuary, 1833, troops were again sent from Frairio du Chien to Dubuquo for that purpose. Ibis was a serious and porbaps uniioeessary hardship imposed upou tho settlers. They were compelled to abandon their cabins and homos in mid-winter. It must now bs said, simply, that \"rsd taps\" should bo rsspsctsd.

Iho first salo ol lots took placs August 16, 1839. Ihe site selected lor the public buildings was a little west ol tho geographical confer ol tho section, where a square ol ten acres on the elevated grounds overlooking tho rivor was reserved lor the purpose. Iho capitol is located in the center ol this squaro. Iho 8ecoud Territorial legislature, which assembled in November, 1839, passed an act requiring the Commissioners to adopt such plan lor tho building that tbo aggrogats cost whon complete should not exceed P51,999, and il they bad already adopted a plan involving a groator expenditure they were directed to abandon it.

THE ROliNDARV 0UE8II0N. The boundary lino botween the lorritory ol Iowa and ths 8tats ol Missouri was a difficult question to settle in 1838, in consequence ol claims arising lrom taxos and titles, and at ono timo civil war was imminent. In defining ths boundaries ol tho counties bordering on Missouri, tbo Iowa authorities had fixed a line that has since been established as tbe boundary botween Iowa and Mis souri. The Constitution ok Missouri defined ber northern boundary to bs the parallel ok latitude which passes through tho rapids ok the Des Moinos Rivor. Iho lower rapids ok tho Mississippi immediately above the moiftb ok the Des Moines River had always been Known as tho Des Moines Rapids, or \" tds rapids ok tdo Dos Moines River.\" Ihe Missourians (evidently not well versed in history or geography) insisted on running the northern boundary lino from tho rapids in tho Dos Moinos Rivor, just below Xeosauqua, thus taking from Iowa a strip of territory eight or ten miles wide. Assuming this as her northern boundary lino, Missouri attomptod to oxoreise jurisdiction over the disputed territory by assessing taxes, and sending her 8heriffs to collect them by distraining ths personal property of tho settlers. The lowans, however, were not disposed to submit, and tho Missouri officials were arrested by the 8herifks of Davis and Van Rurou Countiss and confinod in jail. Gov. Roggs, ok Missouri, called out dis militia to enforce ths claim and sustain ths officsrs of Missouri. Gov. lucas callod out tho militia ok Iowa, and both partios mads activs preparations for war. In Iowa, about 1,299 mou were onlistod, and 599 woro actually armod and encamped in Van Ruren Couuty. ready to defend the integrity of the Territory, subsequently, Gen. A. C. Dodge, of Furliugton, Gen. Churohman, of Dubuque, and Dr. Clark, of Fort Madison, wore sent to Missouri as onvoys plenipotentiary, to effect, if possible, a peaceable adjustment ok the difficulty, lipon their arrival, they found that ths Couuty Commissionors ok ClarKo County, Missouri, bad rescinded their order for tho collection of tho taxes, ltnd that Gov. Roggs had despatched messengers to the Governor of Iowa proposing"], [192, "178 HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. to 8ubmit an agreed ca8e to tho 8uproms Court ok ths Finited 8tates for ths final 8ottlement ok the bouudary quo3tion. Ihi8 proposition was declined, but afterward Congress authorised a suit to sottlo tho controversy, which was insti tuted, and whieb resulted in a judgment for Iowa. lindor this decision, Wiiliam G. Minor, ok Missouri, and Henry F. Ilendershott were appointed Commissioners to survey and establish the boundary. Mr. Nourso remarks that \" the expenses ok the war on the part ok Iowa wore never paid, either by ths F'nited 8tates or tho Territorial Government. Ihe patriots who furnished supplies to ths troops had to bear the cost aud charges ok tho strugglo.\" Ihe first legislative assembly laid ths broad foundation of civil equality, on which has been constructed ono of tho most liberal governments in the linion. Its first act was to rocognixe tho equality of woman with man before the law by providing that \" no action commenced by a siuglo woman, who intermarries during the pendency thereof, shall abats on account ok such marriage.\" Ibis prim eiple has been adopted by all subsequent legislation in Iowa, and to-day woman has lull and equal civil rights with man, except only tho right of tho ballot. Religious toleration was also secured to all, personal liberty strictly guarded, the rights and privileges ok citizenship extended to all white persons, and ths purity ok elections securod by heavy penalties against bribery and corruption. Ihe judiciary power was vested iu a 8uprsme Court, District Court, Frobats Court, and dustices ok tho Foace. Real estate was made divisible by will, and intestate property divided equitably among heirs. Murder was made punishable by death, and proportionate penalties fixed for lesser crimes. A system of free schools, open lor every class of whits citizens, was established. Frovision was made for a 8y8tem of roads and highways. Thus under the territorial organs nation, ths country bogan to smsrgs from a savage wilderness, aud take on ths forms ol civil govsrnmsnt. Ry act ol Congress ol dune 12, 1838, ths lands whieb had been purchased ol tho Indians woro brought into market, and land offices opened in Dubuque and Rurlington. Congress provided lor military roads and bridges, which greatly aided the settlers, who were now coming in dy tdousands, to make their homes on ths kertils prairies ol Iowa \u2014 \" ths Rsautilul Fand.\" Ihe lams ol ths country had spread lar and wide ; even belore tho Indian title was extinguished, many were crowding tho borders, impatient to cross over and stake out their claims on tho choicest spots thoy couid find in tho new Territory. As soon as the country was opon lor settlement, tbe borders, the RlacK Hawk Furchase, all along the Mississipi, and up the principal rivers and streams, and out ovor tho broad and rolling prairies, began to be thronged witd eager land hunters and immigrants, seeking homes in Iowa. It was a sight to delight the eyes ol all comers lrom every land \u2014 its noble streams, beautiful and picturesque dills aud valleys, droad and lertile prairies extending as lar as tde eye could roach, with a soil surpassing in richness anything which they had evsr sssn. It is not to bo wondered at that immigration into Iowa was rapid, and that within less than a decade lrom tho organisation ol the Territory, it contained a hundred and fifty thousand pooplo. As rapidly as the Indian titles were extinguisded and the original owners removed, the resistless tide ol emigration flowed westward. Ths following extract lrom dudgo Nourso's Centennial Address shows how tbo immigrants gathered on the Indian boundary, ready lor tho removal ol tho barrier : In obedience to our progressive aud aggressive spirit, tbe (government ot tbe United Statee made another treaty with the Sac and Fox Indians, on the llth day ol August, 1842, lor the remaining portion ol their laud in Iowa. The treaty provided that the Indians should retain"], [193, "179 HISTORY OF THF STATE OF IOWA. possession ol all the lands thus ceded until May I, 1843, and should occupy that portion ol the ceded territory west ot a line running north and south through RedrocK, until October 11, 1845. These tribes, at this time, had their principal village at Ot-tum-wa-uo, uow called Ottumwa. A\u00bb soou as it became Known that tbe treaty had been concluded, there was a rush ol immigratiou to Iowa, aud a great number ol temporary settlements were made near the Indian boundary, wait ing lor the 1st day ol May, As the day approached, hundreds ol families encamped along the line, and their tents and wagon\u00bb gave the scene tbe appearance ol a military expedition. Tbe country beyond bad been thoroughly explored, but tbe United States military authorities bad prevented any settlement or even the making out ol claims by any monuments whatever. To aid them in making out their claims when tbe hour should arrive, the settlers bad placed piles ol dry wood on the rising ground, at convenient distances, and a, short time belore twelve o'clock ol the night ol the 30th ol April, these were lighted, and when the midnight hour arrived, it was announced by the discharge ol firearms. The night was dark, but this army ot occupa tion pressed forward, torch in hand, with axe and hatchet, biasing lines with all manner ok curves and angles. When daylight came and revealed tbe contusion ot these wonderful surveys, midnight of the 3Ntb of April and sundown of the 1st of May, over one thousaud families had settled ou their new purchase. While this scene was transpiring, tbe retreating Indians were enacting one more impressive \u00bbud melancholy. The Winter ol 1842-43 was one ol unusual severity, aud the Indian prophet, who had disapproved ol tbe treaty, attributed the severity ot the Winter to tbe anger ot the Oreat Spirit, because they had sold their country. Many religious rites were performed to atone for the crime. When the time for leaving Ot-tum-wa-uo arrived, a solemu silence pervaded the Indian camp, aud tbe faces of their stoutest men were bathed in tears ; and when their cavalcade was put iu motiou, toward tbe setting suu, there was a spontaneous outburst of frantic griel lrom the entire procession. The Indians remained the appointed time beyond tbe line running north and south through RedrocK, The government established a trading post and military encampment at the Raccoon Fork ol the Hes Moines River, then and lor many years Known as Fort Des Moines, Here the red man lingered uutil the llth ol October, l845, when the same scene that we have belore described was re-enacted, and the wave ol immigration swept over the remainder ol the \" New Furchase.\" The lands thus occupied aud claimed by the settlers still belonged in lee to tbe Oen eral (government. The surveys were not completed until some time alter tbe Indian title was extinguished. Alter their survey, tbe lands were publicly proclaimed or advertised lor sale at public auction. Under the laws ol the United States, a pre-emption or exclusive right to purchase public lauds could uot be acquired uutil alter tbe lands bad thus beeu publicly offered and not sold lor want ol bidders. Then, and not until then, an occupant making improvements in good taith might acquire a right over others to cuter the land at the minimum price ol PI, 25 per llcre. The \" claim laws \" were unknown to the United States statutes. They originated in the \" eternal titness ol things,\" aud were enforced, probably, as belonging to that class of natural rights uot enumerated iu tbe coustitution, and not impaired or disparaged by its enumeration. The settlers organised in every settlement prior to the public land sales, appointed omcers, and adopted their own rules and regulations, Fach man's claim was duly ascertained and recorded by the Secretary. It was the duty of aii to attend tbe sales. Tbe Secretary bid off the lauds of each settler at HI, 25 per acre. The others were there, to see, first, that he did his duty and bid in the land, and, secondly, to see that no one ei\u00abe ilck. This, of course, sometimes led to trouble, but it saved the excitement ol competition, and gave a lormality and degree ol order and regularity to tbe proceedings they would not otherwise have attained. As lar as practicable, the Territorial legislature recognised the validity ol these \" claims \" npon the public lands, and in 1839 passed an act legalising their sale and making their transfer a valid consideration to sup port a promise to pay lor the same. (Acts ol 1843, p. 456). The Supreme Territorial Oourt held this law to be valid. (See Hill v. Smith, 1st Morris Rep, 70), The opinion not only con tains a decision of tbe question involved, but also contains much valuable erudition upon that \" spirit ol Anglo-Saxon liberty\" which the Iowa settlers unquestionably inherited in a direct line ol descent from the said \" Anglo-Saxons,\" Rut the early settler was not always able to pay even this dollar and twenty-nve cents per acre lor bis land. Many ol ths ssttlsrs had nothing to bogin with, save tdoir dands, health and courage and their family jewels, \"the pledges ol love,\" and tho \" consumers ol bread.\" It was not so easy to accumulate monoy in ths early days ol tbe 8tate, and the \"beautiful prairies,\" ths \"nobis streams,\" and all that sort ol pootic imagory, did not provont ths sarly settlers from becoming discouraged. An old settler, in speaking of tho privations and trials of thoso oarly days, says: Well do the \" old settlers ' ol Iowa remember the days lrom the tirst settlement to 1840. Those were days ol sadness and distress. The endearments ol home in another land had been vi"], [194, "180 HISTORV OF THF STATF OF IOWA. broken up ; and all that was hallowed on earth, the home of childhood and the scenes \u00abf youth, we severed ; aud we sat dowu by the gentle waters ol our uoble river, aud olteu \" huug our harps on the willows.\" from another part ok tho 8tate, testifies : There was no such thing as getting money lor any Kind ol labor, I laid brick at F3.00 per thousand, and took my pay in anything I could eat or wear, I built the tlrst Methodist Ohurch at ReoKuK, 42x60 leet, ol brick, lor Z600, and took my pay in a subscriptiou paper, part ol which I uever collected, and upon which I only received A50 00 in money. Wheat was hauled 100 miles lrom the interior, and sold lor 37^ cents per bushel. Another old settler, speaking ok a lator period, 1843, says : Rand and everything had gone down in value to almost nominal prices. Oorn aud oats could be bought lor six or ten cents a bushel ; pork, Z1.00 per hundred ; aud the best horse a mau could raise sold lor 350.00, Nearly all were in debt, and the Sheritl and Oonstable, with legal processes, were common visitors at almost every man's door. These were indeed \"tbe times that tried men's souls,\" \"A few,\" says Mr. Nourso, \"who woro not equal to the trial, returned to their old homes, but such as had the eourago and faith to bo tho worthy founders ok a great 8tate remained, to more than roali^o the fruition ok their hopos, aud \u00bbho reward ok their self-denial.\" On Monday, December 6, 1841, the fourth legislative Assembly met, at the new capital, Iowa City, but tbo capitol building could not bo used, and ths lsgislaturs occupied a temporary frams house, that had been erected for that purpose, during the session of 1841-2. At this session, tho 8uporintendent of Fublie Fuildings (who, with tho Territorial Agout, had superseded the Commis sioners first appointed), estimated the expense of completing the building at P33,339, and that rooms lor the use ol the legislature could bo comploted lor P15,699. During 1842, tho 8up6riutoudont commoncod obtaining stone lrom a now quarry, about ton miles northeast ol tho city. This is now Known as tho \" Old Capitol Ouarry,\" and contains, it is thought, au immense quantity ol excellent building stone. Here all the stone lor completing the building was obtained, and it was so lar completed, that on ths 5th day ol Docsmbsr, 1842, ths Fsgis lature assembled in the new capitol. At this session, tho 8uporintendent esti mated that it would cost H39,143 to finish tho buildiug. This was nearly P6,999 higher than the estimate ol the previous year, notwithstanding a large sum dad been expended in the meantime. This rather discouraging diserep ancy was accounted lor by the lact that the officers in cbargo ol tho work were constantly short ol funds. Except the congressional appropriation of V29,999 and ths loan of P5,599, obtained from tbo Minors' Rank, of Dubuquo, all tho funds for tho prosecution ok tho work wero derived from the sale of tho city lots (which did not sell very rapidly), from certificates of indebtedness, and from scrip, based upon unsold lots, which was to bo received in payment for such lots whon thoy were sold, ono timo, tho 8uperiutendent made a requisitiou lor bills of iron and glass, which could not bo obtained nearer than 8t. Fouis. To meet this, the Agent sold some lots for a draft, payablo at Fittsburgh, Fa., lor which he was compelled to pay tweuty-five per cent, exchange. This draft, amounting to G597, that officer reported to bo moro than ono-ball tho cash actually handled by him during the entire season, when the disbursements amounted to vory nearly P24,999. With such uncertainty, it could not do expected that estimates could bo very accurate. With all these disadvantages, however, the work appears to have been prudently prosecuted, and as rapidly as circumstances would permit."], [195, "HISTORY OF THR STATF OF IOWA. 181 Iowa remained a Territory from 1838 to 1846, during whieb tho offico of Governor was held by Robert lucas, dohn Chambers and dames Clarke. 8IAIE ORGANISATION. Ry an act ok the Territorial legislature ok Iowa, approved February 12, 1844, the question ok the formation ok a 8tato Constitution and providing for tho election ok Delegates to a convention to bo convened for that purpose was submitted to tho people, to bo voted upou at tboir township elections in April following. Iho vote was largely in lavor of tho moasuro, and tho Delegates elected assembled in convention at Iowa City, on tbo 7th of Octobor, 1844. On tho first day of November following, tho convention completed its work and adopted tho first 8tato Constitution. The Frssident of tho convention, Hon. 8hopherd leffier, was instructed to transmit a certified copy of this Constitution to tho Dologato in Congress, to bo by him submitted to that body at tho oarliest practicable day. It was also pro vided that it should bo submitted, together with any conditions or changes that might be made by Congress, to tho pooplo of ths Territory, for thoir approval or rejection, at ths township slsction in April, 1845. Iho boundaries of tbs 8tats, as defined by this Constitution, were as sol lows: Legiuning in the middle ol the channel ol the Mississippi River, opposite mouth ol tbe Hes Moines River, thence up the said river Hes Moines, in the middle ol the main channel thereof, to a point where it is intersected by tbe Old Indian Roundary line, or line run by 0, Sullivan, in the year 1816 ; thence westwardly along said line to the \" old \" northwest corner of Missouri ; theuce due west to the middle ol the main channel ol the Missouri River ; thence up in the middle ol the main channel ol the river last mentioned to tbe mouth ol the Sioux or Oalumet River ; theuce iu a direct line to the middle ol the main channel ol the St, Feters River, where the Watonwan River \u2014 according to Nicollet's map \u2014 enters the same ; theuce down the middle ol the main channel ol said river to the middle of the main channel ol the Mississippi These boundaries were rejected by Congress, but by act approved March 3, 1845, a 8tate called Iowa was admitted iuto tho Union, provided tho peoplo accepted tbo act, bounded as follows : Reginning at tbe mouth ol the Hes Moines River, at the middle ol the Mississippi, thence by the middle ot the channel ol that river to a parallel ol latitude passing through the mouth ol the ManKato or Line Narth River; theuce west, along said parallel ol latitude, to a point where it is intersected by a meridian line seventeen degrees and thirty minutes west ol the meridian ol Washington Oitv ; thence due south, to the northern boundary line ol tbe State ol Missouri; thence eastwardly, following that boundarv to the point at which the same intersects tbe Hes Moines River ; thence by the middle of the channel of that river to the place of beginning. Ihoss boundaries, had they been accepted, would havo placed tho northorn boundary ok tho 8tats about thirty milos north ok its present location, and would havo deprived it ok the Missouri slopo aud tbs boundary ok that rivor. Ths western boundary would havo doen near tds west fins ok what is now Xossuth County. Rut it was not so to bo. In conssqusncs ok this radical and uuvvel come changs in tbs boundaries, the people refused to aceopt tbo act ok Congress and rejected the Constitution at the election, held August 4, 1845, by a veto ok 7,656 to 7,235. A second Constitutional Convention assembled at Iowa City on ths 4th day ok May, 1846, and on ths 18th ok ths sains month another Constitution for tho now 8tate with ths prsssnt boundariss, was adoptod and submitted to the people for ratification on ths 3d day of August following, whon it was accepted ; 9,492 votes woro cast \"lor tho Constitution,\" and 9,936 \"against tho Constitution \""], [196, "182 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. The Constitution was approved by Congress, and by act ol Congress approved December 28, 1846, Iowa was admitted as a sovereign 8tate in the American Finion. Frior to this action ol Congress, bowovor, tbs psoplo ol tho now 8tate held an election under the new Constitution on ths 26th day of October, and elected Orssel Rriggs, Governor ; Elisha Cutler, dr., 8ocretary ok 8tate ; dosoph I. Falss, Auditor ; Morgan Rono, Treasurer ; and members ok tho 8enats and Fiouso ok Representatives. At this time there were twenty-seven organised counties in tbs 8tate, with a population of nearly 199,999, and the frontier settlements were rapidly push ing toward the Missouri Rivor. Tho Mormons had already reached there. Ihe first General Assembly ok tbs 8tate ok Iowa was composed ok nineteen 8enators and forty Representatives. It assembled at Iowa City, November 39, 1846, about a month be/o?-s tbo 8tate was admitted into tho Finion. At tho first session ok tho 8tate legislature, tbe Treasurer of 8tate reported that the capitol building was iu a very exposed condition, liable to injury from storms, and expressed the hops that somo provision would bs mado to complete it, at least sufficiently to protect it from tho weather. Iho General Assembly responded by appropriating \u00a72,599 A,^ the completion ok tho public buildings. At tho first session also aroso ths question ok tho ro-iocation ok tho capital. The western boundary ok tho 8tate, as now determined, loft Iowa City too far toward tho eastern and southern boundary of tbo 8tate ; this was conceded. Congress had appropriated five sections ok land for the election ok public buildings, and toward the closo ok tho session a bill was introduced providing for the re-location of ths soat of government, involving to somo oxtont tho location of tho 8tato University, which had already been discussed. Ibis bill gave rise to a doal ok discussion and parliamentary maneuvering, almost purely sectional in its character. It provided tor tho appointment ok three Commissionors, who woro authorised to mako a location as near tho geographical center ok tho 8tato as a healthy and eligible site could bs obtained ; to soloct tbo five sections ok land donated by Congress ; to survey and plat into town lots not exceeding ono section ok the land so selected ; to sell lots at public salo, not to exceed two in each block. Having dono this, they were then required to suspend further operations, and make a report ok their proceedings to tho Governor. Tho bill passed both Houses by decisive votes, received the signature ok tho Governor, and became a law. 8oou after, by \" An aot to locato and establish a 8tate University,\" approved February 25, 1847, the unfinished publio buildiugs at Iowa City, together with ths ten acres ok land on whieb they were situated, were granted for tho uso ok tho University, reserving their use, bowovor, by the General Assembly and tbe 8tate officers, until other provisions woro mado by law. Ihe Commissionors forthwith entered upou their duties, and selected four sections and two half sections in daspor County. Two of these sections are in what is now Dos Moines Township, and the others in Fairviow Township, in ths southern part ok that county. Theso lands aro situated between Frairie City and Monroe, on tbo XooKuK A Des Moines Railroad, which runs diagonally through them. Here a town was platted, called Monroe City, and a sale of lots took placo. Four hundred and fifteen lots were sold, at prieos that were not considered remarkably remunerative. Ihe cash payments (ono-fourth) amounted to \u00a71,797.43, whilo tho expense of tho sale and the claims of tbo Commissioners for services amounted to \u00a72,296.57. The Commissioners made a report of their proceedings to the Governor, as required by law, but the loca tion was generally condemned."], [197, "HISTORY OF THN STATE OF IOWA. 183 Wlion the report ok tbo Commissionors, showing this brilliant financial ope ration, had been read in the House ok Representatives, at ths next session, and whilo it was uuder consideration, an indignant msmbsr, afterward Known as the eccentric .fudge McFarland, moved to rolor tho roport to a select Committee ok Five, with instructions to roport \" how much ok said oity ok Monroo was undor water and how much was durnod.\" Ihe report was roforrod, without tho instructions, bowover, but Monroo City never became the seat ok government. Ry an act approved danuary 15, 1849, the law by which ths location had boon mads was repealed and the new town was vacated, tho monoy paid by purohas ers ok lots being refunded to them. This, of course, retained tde seat ok govern mont at Iowa City, and precluded, for tde time, the occupation ok tbo buildiug and grounds by tho Finivorsity. At tho samo session, \u00a73,999 moro were appropriated for completing the Ltate building at Iowa City.

Iho latter appeared to havo tbs support ok ths majority, but was finally lost in tds Fiouso on ths question ok ordering it to its third reading. tho next session, in 1853, a bill was introduced in tde 8enate for tds removal ok tho seat ok government to Fort Des Moines, and, on final vote, was just barely defeated. At the next session, bowovor, tho effort was more successful, and on the 15th day of danuary, 1855, a bill re-locating tho capital within two miles of tbe Raccoon Fork ol tho Dos Moinos, and lor tho appoint mont ol Commissioners, was approved by Gov.

Dos Moines was now tho permanent seat of government, mads so by ths fundamental law ok ths 8tate, and on tbo 11th day ok danuary, 1858, ths seventh General Assembly convened at ths new capital. Ihe building used for governmental purposes was purchased in 1864.

Agents appointed by the Governor selected the sections designated by \"odd numbors\" throughout tho wholo extend ok tho grant, and this selection was ap provod by tho 8oerotary ok tbs Treasury. Rut there was a conflict ok opinion as to tho oxtont ok tbo grant. It was bold by somo that it extended from ths mouth ok ths Dss Moines only to the Raccoon Forks ; others held, as the agents to make selection evidently did, that it extended from tbs mouth to tbs head waters ok tho rivor. Richard NI. Voung, Commissioner ok tho General land Office, on ths 23d ok Fodruary, 1848, construed tde grant to mean that \" the 8tats is entitled to tho alternate sections within fivo miles ok tho Dos Moinos Rivor, throughout tho whole extent ok that rivor within tho limits ok Iowa.\" Finder this construction, tho alternato sections abovo ths Raccoon Forks would, ok courso, bslong to tho 8tato; but on tbs 19th ok duns, 1848, some ok tbess lands wsrs, by proclamation, thrown into market. On the 18td ok 8optember, ths Roard ok Fublio Works filsd a rsmonstranco with tho Com missionor ok ths Gsnsral Fand Offics. Ths Roard also sent in a protest to ths 8tate land Office, at which ths sals was ordered to take place. On ths 8th ok danuary, 1849, tho 8enators and Representatives in Congress from Iowa also protested against the sals, in a communication to Fion. Robert d. Walker, 8ec retary of the Treasury, to which tho 8ecretary replied, concurring in ths opinion that tho grant extended the wholo length ok the Dss Moines River in Iowa. On ths 1st ok duno, 1849, tbo Commissionor ok ths Gsnoral land Office directed ths Register and Receiver ok the land Offieo at Iowa City \" to with hold from salo all lands situated in the odd numbered sections within fivo miles on each side of tbo Des Moines River above the Raccoon Forks.\" March 13, 1859, tbo Commissionor ok ths Gsnsral land Offics submitted to tho 8ocrotary ok ths Interior a list \"showing tbo tracts falling within ths limits of ths Dss Moinos Rivor grant, abovo tho Raccoon Forks, otc, under the decision ok tho 3oorotary ok tho Treasury, ok March 2, 1849,\" and on ths 6th ok April following, Mr. Ewing, then 8ecretary of ths Interior, reversed the decision ok 8ecretary Walker, but ordorod ths lauds to bs withheld from sale until Con-"], [222, "208 HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. gross could have an opportunity to pass an explanatory act. Iho Iowa author ities appealed from this decision to tho Frosidont (Taylor), who roforied tho matter to tho Attorney General (Mr. dohnson). On the 19th of duly, Mr. dohnson submitted as his opinion, that by tho terms of tho grant itsolf, it ex tended to tho vsry soures ok ths Des Moines, but before his opiuion was pub lished Fresident lavlor died. When Mr. Tyler's cabinet was formed, the question was submitted to the new Attornoy General (Mr. Crittendeu), who, on tho 39tb ok duns, 1851, reported that in his opinion tho grant did not extend above tho Raccoon Forks. Mr. 8tewart, 8ecretary of the Interior, concurred with Mr. Crittenden at first, but subsequently consented to lay the whole sub jeet before the Fresident and Cabinet, who decided in favor of tho 8tate. October 29, 1851, Mr. 8tswart directed the Commissionor of the General Fand Office to \"submit for his approval such lists as bad been prepared, and to proceed to report for liko approval lists of ths altsrnats ssctions claimed by the 8tats of Iowa abovo tho Raccoon Forks, as far as tho surveys have progressed, or may hereafter be completed and returned.\" And on tho following day, three lists of these lands were prepared in the General land Offics. Ths lands approved and certified to ths 8tats of Iowa undor this grant, and all lying abovo ths Raccoon Forks, ars as follows : Dv secretar? stewart, Oet. 30, 1851 81,707.93 acres, blared 10, 1852 143.908.37 \" Dv secretarv I>IeLellau, Dec. 17, 1853 33.142.43 \" Dec. 30, 1853 12,813.51 \" lotal 271,572.24 acres. Iho Commissioners and Register ol tho Des Moinos Rivor Improvement, in their report to ths Governor, November 39, 1852, estimates the total amouut of lands then available for tho work, including tboso in possession of tho 8tato and thoso to bo surveyed and approved, at nearly a million acres. Iho indebtedness then standing against ths fund was about \u00a7198,999, and ths Commissioners estimated the work to bs dono would cost about \u00a71,299,999. danuary 19, 1853, tho logislaturo authorised the Commissionors to sell \" any or all tbo lauds which have or may hereafter be granted, for not less than \u00a71,390,999.\" On the 24tb of danuary, 1853, tho General Assembly provided for tho elee tion of a Commissionor by tho pooplo, and appointod two Assistant Commission ors, with authority to make a contract, selling the lands of the Improvement for \u00a71,399,999. This now Roard mado a contract, duuo 9, 1855, with tho Des Moines Navigation ot Railroad Company, agreeing to sell ae? the lauds donated to tho 8tato by Act of Congress of August 8, 1846, which tho 8tate had not sold prior to December 23, 1853, for \u00a71,399,999, to be expended on tho im provemsnt ok tbo rivor, and in paying tho indebtedness then due. This eon tract was duly reported to tbo Governor and Gonoral Assembly. Ry an act approved danuary 25, 1855, tho Commissionor and Register ok tho Des Moines Rivor Improvement woro authorised to negotiate with the Des Moines Navigation ot Railroad Company kor tho purchaso ok lands in Webster County which had been sold by the 8ehool Fund Commissioner as school lands, but which had boon certified to tbe 8tate as Des Moinos Rivor lands, and had, therefore, become the property of tho Company, under the provisions of its contract with tho 8tato. March 21, 1856, tho old question of tho extent of tho grant was again raised and ths Commissioner ok the General land Office decided th>). it was limited to"], [223, "HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. 209 tdo Raccoon Fork. Appeal was made to tho 8ecretary of tho Interior, and by him tho matter was referred to tho Attorney General, who decided that the grant extended to tho nortborn boundary of tho 8tato; ths 8tats relinquished its claim to lands lying along tbs river in Minnesota, and the vexed question was supposed to bo finally settled. The land which dad been certified, as well' as those extending to tho north ern boundary within tho limits of the grant, were reserved from pre-emption and sale by the General land Commissioner, to satisfy tho grant of August 8, 1846, and they wero treated as having passed to tho 8tate, which from time to time sold portions of them prior to tboir final transfer to tho Des Moines i^avi igation <it Railroad Company, applying tho proceeds thereof to the improve ment of tho river in complianco with tho terms of the grant. Frior to tho final sale to tho Company, duno 9, 1854, the 8tats had sold about 327,999 acres, of which amount 58,839 acros wero located abovo tho Raccoon Fork. Ihe last certificate ok tbs General Fand Office bears date December 39, 1853. 'Aster dune 9th, 1854, the Des Moinos Navigation ot Railroad Company carried on tho work under its eontraot with tbs 8tats. .As ths improvement progressed, the 8tats, from time to time, by its authorised otficers, issued to tho Company, in payment for said work, certificates fur lands. Rut tho General Fand Office ceased to certify lands undor tho grant of 1846. Iho 8tate had mads no other provision for paying for tho improvements, and disagree ments and misunderstanding aroso botween ths 8tate authorities and ths Company. March 22, 1858, a joint resolution was passed by tbe legislature submitting a proposition for final sottlsmont to tho Company, which was accepted. Ihe Com pany paid to tho 8tato \u00a729,999 in cash, and rolsasod and convoyed tho dredge boat and materials namod in tbs resolution ; and tho 8tato, on ths 3d of May, 1858, executed to' the Des Moinos Navigation it Railroad Company fourteen deeds or patents to tho lands, amounting to 256,793.64 acros. Ihcss deeds were intended to convey all tho lands of this grant certified to tbo 8tato by tho Gen eral Government not previously sold ; but, as if for tho purposo of covering any tract or parcol that migdt davo been omitted, ths 8tate mads anothor deed of convsyancs on tho 18th day of May, 1858. These fifteen deeds, it is claimed, by ths Company, convey 266,198 acres, ok which about 53,367 are below the Raccoon Fork, and tho balanco, 212,741 acres, aro abovo tli^t point. Resides the lands deeded to tho Company, ths 8tats bad deeded to individual purchasers 58,839 acres abovo ths Raccoon Fork, making an aggregate ok 271, 571 acros, dooded abovo tho Fork, all ok which had boon certified to tho 8tato by tho Federal Govsrnmont. Ry aot approved March 28, 1858, tbo legislature donated the remainder ok tho grant to the XooKuK, Fort Des Moines A Minnesota Railroad Company, upon condition that said Company assumed all liabilities resulting from tho Dos Moines Rivor improvement operations, reserving 59,999 acres ok tho land in security for tho payment thereof, and for tho oomplotion of ths locks and dams at Rontonsport, Croton, Xoosauqua and Flymouth. For every three thousand dollars' worth of work dono on tho locks and dams, and for ovsry thros thousand dollars paid by ths Company ok tho liabilities abovo mentioned, the Register ok tho 8tato Fand Offico was instructed to cortiky to tho Company 1,999 acres ok tho 59,999 acros reserved kor those purposes. lip to 1865, thoro had been pre sensed by the Company, under the provisions ok ths act ok 1858, and allowed, claims amounting to \u00a7199,579.37, about seventy-five per cent, of which had boen settled."], [224, "210 HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. After the passage of tho Act abovo noticod, tbs question ok tho extent ok ths original grant was again mooted, and at the December Term ok the 8uprems Court ok tho Finited 8tates, in 1859-69, a decision was rendorod doclaring that the grant did not extend abovo Raccoon Fork, and that all certificates of land \u00abi>o?^ the Fork bad been issued without authority of law and were, therefore, void (see 23 How., 66). Iho 8tate of Iowa had disposed of a largo amount of land without authority, according to this decision, and appeal was mado to Congress for relief, which was granted on tho 3d day ok March, 1861, in a joint resolution relinquishing to tho 8tats all the title which the Finited 8tates then still retained in the tracts ok land along the Des Moines River abovo Raccoon Fork, that had been im properly certified to ths 8tats by ths Department ok the Interior, and which is now hold by oo\u00ab\u00bb/cis purchasers under tde 8tate ok Iowa. In confirmation ok this rolinquisdment, dy act approved duly 12, 1862, Congress enacted : That the grant of lands to the then Territory ollowa for the improvement ofthe Des JVIoines River, made by the act ol August 8, 1846, is hereby extended so as to include the alternate sec tions by odd numbers) lying within five miles ol said river, between the Raccoon Fork aud the northern boundary of said State ; such lands are to be held and applied in accord to tbe application of a portion thereof to aid iu tbe construction ol the ReoKuK, Fort Des Moines ii IVIiuuesota Railroad, in accordance with the provisions ol the act ol the Oeneral Assembly ol the State ol Iowa, approved March 22, l858. And il any ol the said lands shall have been sold or otherwise disposed ol by the United States before the passage of this act, except those released by the United States to tbe grantees of the State of Iowa, nnder resolution ol March 8, 1861, the Secretary ol the Interior is hereby directed to set apart an equal amount ol lands within said State to be certified in lieu thereof; />\u00abm</e^, that if the State shall have sold aud conveyed any portion of the lands lying within the limits of tbe grant the title of which has proved invalid, any lands which shall be certified to said State in lieu thereof by virtue of the provisions of this act, shall inure to and be held as a trust fund for the benent of the person or persons, respect ively, whose titles shall have failed as aforesaid. The grant ok lands by tho abovo act ok Congross was accepted by a joint resolution ok ths General Assembly, 8eptember 11, 1862, in extra session. On tho samo day, the Governor was authorised to appoint ono or moro Commis sioners to select the lands in accordance with the grant. These Commissioners were instructed to report their selections to tho Registrar ok the 8tats land Office. Iho lands so selected were to bs held kor the purposes ok the grant, and were not to bs disposed ok until further legislation should bs had. D. W. Xil burne, ok lee County, was appointed Commissionor, and, on tbe 25th day ok April, 1864, tbe General land Officer authorised the selection ok 399,999 acres from the vacant public lands as a part ok tho grant ok duly 12, 1862, and the selections were made in the Fort Dodge and 8ioux City land Districts. Many difficulties, controversies and conflicts, in relation to claims and titles, grew out ok this grant, and those difficulties were enhanced by the uncertainty ok its limits until tho act ok Congress ok duly, 1862. Rut tho Gsnoral Assem bly sought, by wise and appropriate logislation, to protect tbe integrity ok titles derived from ths 8tats. Especially was the determination to protoot ths actual settlers, who had paid their money and made improvements prior to tho final settlement of tho limits ol tho grant by Congress. VII. \u2014 THE DES ZI0INE8 RIVER SOHOOE RANDS. These lands constituted a part ol tho 599,999 aero grant mado by Congress in 1841 ; including 28,378.46 acres in Webster County, selected by the Agent ol \"bs 8tate under that grant, and approved by tbo Commissioner ol tho General l^nd Office February 29, 1851. Idey were ordered into tho market duuo 6,"], [225, "HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. 211 1853, by tho 8uperintendent ol Fublic Instruction, who authorised dohn lol. man, 8ebool Fund Commissioner for Webster County, to soli them as school lands. 8ubsequently, when the aet of 1846 was construed to extend ths Des Moines Rivor grant above Raccoon Fork, it was held that tbe odd numbored sections ok tbeso lands within five miles ok tdo river were appropriated dy that act, and on tbe 39th day ok December, 1853, 12,813.51 acres were set apart and approved to tbo 8tato by tho 8ocrotary ok tho Interior, as a part ok ths Des Moines River grant. danuary 6, 1854, the Commissionor ok the General land Office transmitted to the 8uperintendent ok Fublic Instruction a certified copy ok the lists ok these lands, indorsed by tho 8ocretary ok the Interior. Frior to this action ok tho Department, however, Mr. Tolman had sold to indi vidual purchasers 3,194.28 aeres as school lands, and their titles were, ok course, Killed. For their relief an act, approved April 2, 1869, provided that, upon application and proper showing, tbeso purchasers should bo entitled to draw from tho 8tato Treasury ths amount they had paid, with 19 per cent, interest, on ths contract to purchase made with Mr. Tolman. Finder this act, five appli cations woro mado prior to 1864, and tho applicants received, in the aggregate, \u00a7949.53. Ry an act approved April 7, 1862, tho Governor was forbiddon to issuo to tbo Dubuquo ot 8ioux City Railroad Company any certificate ofthe completion of any part of said road, or any conveyance ok lands, until tho company should execute and file, in the 8tate land Office, a release ok its claim \u2014 first, to cor tain swamp lands; second, to tho Des Moines River lands sold by Tolman; third, to certain othor river lands. That act provided that \" the said company shall transfer their interest in thoso tracts ok land in Webster and Hamilton Counties heretoioro sold by dohn Tolman, 8cbool Fund Commissioner, to tho Register ok ths 8tats Fand Offics in trust, to enabls said Register to carry out and perform said contracts in all cases when he is called upon by the parties interested to do so, bolero the 1st day of danuary, A. D. 1864. The company filsd its release to tho Tolman lands, in tho land Office, Feb ruary 27, 1864, at tbs same time entered its protest that it had no claim upon them, nsvsr had pretended to havo, and had nevor sought to claim thorn. The Register of tho 8tato layd Office, under the advice of ths Attorney General, decided that patents would be issued to tho Tolman purchasers in all cases where contracts had been made prior to December 23, 1853, and remaining uneanceled under tho act of 1869. Rut boforo any woro issued, on tho 27th ok August, 1864, tho Des Moines Navigation it Railroad Company commenced a suit in chancery, in the District Court ok Folk County, to enjoin tho issuo ok such patents. On ths 39th ok August, an ex injunction was issued. In danuary, 1868, Mr. d. A. Harvey, Register ok tho land Office, filed in the court an elaborate answer to plaintiffs' petition, denying that ths company had any right to or titlo in tho lands. Mr. Harvey's successor, Mr. C. C. Carpon ter, filed a still moro exhaustive answer February 19, 1868. August 3, 1868 tbe District Court dissolved the injunction. Iho company appealed to the 3uprems Court, where the decision ok tho lower court was affirmed in December 1869. VIII. \u2014 SWAM? EAND ORANT. Ry an act ok Congress, approved March 28, 1859, to enabls Arkansas and other 8tates to reclaim swampy lands within their limits, granted all tds swamp and overflowed lands remaining unsold within their respective limits to tho several 8tates. Although tho total amount claimed by Iowa undor this aet c>"], [226, "212 HISTORV OF THE STATE OF IOWA. does not oxcsed 4,999,999 acres, it has, like tbe Des Moinos River and some ok the land grants, cost tho 8tato considerable trouble and oxponso, and required a deal ok legislation. Iho 8tate expended large sums ok money in making the selections, securing proofs, etc., but ths General Government appeared to be laboring under the impression that Iowa was not acting in good faith ; that she dad selected a large amount of lands under the swamp land grant, transferred ber interest to counties, and counties to private speculators, and tbe General Fand Office permitted contests as to tho character ok tho lands already selected bv the Agents ok tho 8tato as \" swamp lands.\" Congross, by joint resolution Dee. 18, 1856, and by aet March 3, 1857, saved the 8tats lrom tho fatal result of this ruinous policy. Many of these lands were selected in 1854 and 1855, immediately after several remarkably wet seasons, and it was but natural that some portions ofthe selections would not appear swampy after a few dry seasons. 8oms time after tbeso first selections wsrs mads, persons desired to enter parcels of the so-called swamp lands and ottering to prove them to be dry. In such cases the General land Office ordered hearing beforo ths local land officers. and if they decided the land to bo dry, it was permitted to bo entered and the claim ok tho 8tate rejected. 8peculators took advantage ok this. Affidavits wors bought of irrssponsibls and rockless men, who, for a low dollars, would confidently testily to ths character ol lands thoy never saw. These applica tions multiplied until they covered 3,999,999 acres. It was necessary that Congress should confirm all these selections to tho 8tato, that this gigantic scheme ol lraud and plunder might bs stopped. Ihe act ol Congress ol March 3, 1857, was designed to accomplish this purposo. Rut ths Commis sionor ol tbs General land Office held that it was only a qualified confirma tion, and undor this construction sought to sustain tho action ol the Department in rejecting the claim ol tho 8tate, and certilying them under act ol May 15, 1856, undor which tho railroad companies claimed all swamp land in odd num bored sections within the limits ol tboir respective roads. This action led to serious complications. Whon tho railroad grant was mado, it was not intended nor was it understood that it included any ol ths swamp lands. These were already disposed ol by previous grant. Nor did tho companies expect to receive any ol them, but uuder the decisions ol tho Department adverse to the 8tate tho way was opened, and they were not slow to onter their claims. March 4, 1862, the Attorney General ol tho 8tate submitted to tho General Assembly an opinion that tho railroad companies were not entitled even to contest ths right ol tbo 8tato to tbeso lands, under ths swamp land grant. A letter lrom the Acting Commissioner ol tho General land Office expressed the same opinion, and tho General Assembly by joint resolution, approved April 7, 1862, expressly repudiated the acts ol tho railroad companies, and disclaimed any intention to claim tbeso lands undor any othor than tho act ol Congress ol 8ept. 28, 1859. A great deal ol legislation has been found, necessary iu reia tion to these swamp lands. IX. \u2014 THE RAILROAD 6RANT. One ol ths most important grants ol public lands to Iowa lor purposes ol internal improvement was that known as tho \"Railroad Grant,\" by act ol Congross approved May 15, 1856. Ibis act granted to tho 8tate ol Iowa, lor tbs purposo ol aiding iu tho construction ol railroads from Rurlington, ou the Mississippi River, to a point on tho Missouri River, near the mouth ok Flatts River; from tho city of Davenport, via Iowa City and Fort Dos Moines to"], [227, "213 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. Council Rluffs ; from Fyons City northwesterly to a point of intersection witd the main line ok ths Iowa Central Air Fine Railroad, near MaquoKeta ; thence on said main lino, running as near as practicable to ths Forty-sseond Farallel ; across ths said 8tats ok Iowa to tho Missouri Rivor ; from tbo city ok Dubuquo to a point on tho Missouri River, nsar 8ioux City, with a branch from tho mouth ok tho Tots dos Morts, to tho neatest point on said road, to bo com plotod as soon as tho main road is completed to that point, every alternate section ok land, designated by odd numbors, for six sections iu width on oacd sido ok said roads. It was also provided that ik it should appear, when tbe lines ok thoso roads wore definitely fixed, that ths Finited 8tates had sold, or right ok pro omption had attached to any portion ok said land, tbo 8tato was authorised to select a quantity equal thereto, in altornato soctions, or parts ok sections, within fifteen miles of tho lines so located, lbs lands remaining to tho Finited 8tatss within six milss on oach sido ok said roads wsrs not to bs sold kor loss than ths doublo minimum price ok tzho public lands when sold, nor wore any ok said lands to become subject to privato on try until they had been first offered at public sale at the increased price. 8ection 4 ok ths act provided that the lands granted to said 8tato shall bs disposed ok by said 8tato only in tho manner following, that is to say : that a quantity of land not exceeding ono hundred and twenty sections for each of said roads, and included within a continuous length of twenty miles of each ok said roads, may bo sold ; and whon tbe Governor ok said 8tato shall certify to the 8eoretary of tho Intorior that any twenty continuous miles of any of said roads is completed, then another quantity of land hereby granted, not to oxeoed ono hundred and twenty sections for each of said roads having twenty oontinuous miles completed as aforesaid, and included within a continuous longth of twenty miles ok each ok such roads, may bo sold ; and so from timo to time until said roads aro completed, and ik any ok said roads aro not complstod within ten years, no further salo shall bo mads, aud ths lands unsold shall rovort to tho Finited 8tates.\" At a special session of tho Gonoral Assembly of Iowa, by act approved duly 14, 1856, the grant was accepted and the lands were granted by the 8tate to tho several railroad companies named, provided that the lines ol their respective roads should bo definitely fixed and located beloro April 1, 1857 ; and pro vided further, that il either ol said companies should lail to havo ssventy-fivs miles ol road completed and equipped by ths 1st day ol Doeombor, 1859, and its ontiro road complstsd by Dscsmber 1, 1865, it should bo compotent lor tho 8tats ol Iowa to resume all rights to lands remaining undisposed ol by tho company so failing. lho railroad companies, with the single exception ol the Iowa Central Air line, accepted the several grants in accordanco with the provisions ol the abovo aet, located tboir respective roads and selected their lands. lho grant to tho Iowa Central was again granted to the Cedar Rapids A Missouri Rivor Railroad Company, whiob accepted them. Ry act, approved April 7, 1862, tde Dubuque it 8ioux City Railroad Com pany was roquired to execute a release to tho 8tate ol certain swamp and school lands, included withiu the limits ol its grant, in compensation lor an extension ol the time fixed lor tho completion ol its road. A careful examination of tho act of Congress doos not rovoal any spocial rofsronco to railroad efm^aml'sz. lbs lands were granted to tho K\u00abts, and tbo act evidently contemplate tbe sale ol them bl/ t<5s 8tats, and ths appropriation ol ths proeosds to aid in tho construction ol certain lines ol railroad within its"], [228, "214 HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. limits. 3ection 4 ol ths aet clearly defines tbe authority ol tbe 8tate in dis posing ol tho lands. lists ol all tho lands embraced by the grant were made, and certified to tho 8tato by tbs proper authorities. Finder an act ol Congross approved August 3, 1854, entitled \"^lX \u00abst to vest \u00abn t/ls setie^ai Hates ant^ t/^s ti'ti's \u00ab\u00ab /es o/ t/<e i\u00ab\u00ab<.^8 w^l'e/^ been o>\" \u00bb\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab/ bs ee^i'Leci io //^em,\" these certified lists, the originals ol which ars filed in the General land Office, conveyed to ths 8tats \"tbs loo simple title to all ths lands embraced in such lists that ars oltho char acter contemplated \" by the terms ol tho act making ths grant, and \"intended to de granted thereby ; but where lands embraced in such lists are not of ths character embraced by such act of Congress, and were not intended to bo granted thereby, said lists, so far as these lands are concerned, shall be perfectly null and void; and no right, title, claim or interest shall bs convoyed thereby.\" lhoss certified lists mads under the aet ol May 15, 1856, were lorty-three iu number, vis.: For tbo Rurlington it Missouri RiMr Railroad, nino ; lor the Mississippi it Missouri Railroad, 11; for tho Iowa Central Air Fine, thirteen; and for the Dubuque it 8ioux City Railroad, ton. The lands thus approved to tho 8tats were as follows : Durliugton A Missouri Rivsr R. R 287,095.34 acres. ilissiszippi ii blissouri River R. It 774,674.36 \" t7edar Rapids K ziissouri River R. R 775,454.19 \" Dubuque ii. sioux \u00ab<v R. R 1,226,558.32 \" A portion of these bad been selected as swamp lands by ths 8tate, under ths aet of 8eptember 28, 1859, and these, by the terms ok ths aet ok August 3, 1854, could not bo turned over to tho railroads unless the claim ok the 8tate to them as swamp was first rejected. It was not possible to determine from ths records of tho 8tats Fand Offics ths extent of tho conflicting claims arising under tho two grants, as copies of the swamp land selections in somo of tbs counties were not filed of record, lho Commissioner ofthe General Fand Office, however, prepared lists of tho lands claimed by the 8tate as swamp under act of 8eptember 28, 1859, and also claimod by tbe railroad companies under act of May 15, 1856, amounting to 553,293.33 acros, tho claim to which as swamp had been rejected by the Department, lhese wero consequently certified to tho 8tate as railroad lands, There was no modo other than tbo act of dulv, 1856, prescribed lor transferring the title to these lands from tho 8tats to tho companies. Ihe courts had decided that, for tbo purposes ok tbo grant, tho lands belonged to ths 8tats, and to her the companies should look kor tboir titles. It was generally accepted that the act ok tho legislature ok duly, 1856, was all that was neces sary to complete the transfer of titlo. It was assumed that all the rights and powers conferred upon tho 8tato by tho act of Congress of May 14, 1856, were by tbe act of tho General Assembly transferred to tho companies ; in other words, that it was designed to put tho companies in the place of tho 8tate as ths grantees from Congross \u2014 and, thoreforo, that which perfected tho title thereto to tbo 8tato perfected tho titlo to tho companies by virtue of tho aet of duly, 1856. Ono ok ths companies, bowovor, tho Rurliugtou it Missouri River Rail road Company, was not entirely satisfied with this construction. Its managers thought that somo further and specific action of tho 8tats authorities in addition to tho act ok tho legislature was necessary to completo their title. This induced Gov. lowo to attach to tho certified lists his official certificate, under the broad seal ok tho 8tate.

These were the only"], [229, "215 HISTORV OF THE STATE OF IOWA. lands under tbe grant that were certified by the 8tate authorities with any design ok perfecting ths title already vested in the company by the aet of duly, 1856. Tbs lists which wero afterward furnished to ths company were simply certified by the Governor as being oorroot copies of tho lists rooeived by tho 8tate from tbo Finited 8tatos General land Office. These subsequent lists embraced lands that had been claimed by ths 8tato undsr tbs 8wamp land Grant. It was urgsd against ths claim of tbs Companies that ths offset of tho act of tho legislature was simply to substitute them for the 8tate as parties to ths grant. 1st. That ths lands wsrs granted to the 8tate to bo held in trust for ths accomplishment ok a specific purpose, and tberefors tho 8tato could not part with the title until that purpose should havo boon accomplished. 2d. That it was not the intention ok tho act ok duly 14, 1856, to deprive the 8tate ok tbs con trol ok tho lands, but on ths contrary that shs should retaiu supervision ok thorn aud tbe right to withdraw all rights aud powers and resume the title condition ally conferred by that act upon tbo companies in tbe event ok their failure to complete their part ok the contract. 3d. That ths certified lists from tho Gen eral land Offioo vested the title iu the 8tate only by virtuo ok tho act ok Con gross approved August 3, 1854. The 8tate land Office held that the proper construction ok tho act ok duly 14, 1856, whon accepted by tho oompaniss, was that it became a sonH'tl'onai contract that might ripen into a positive sals ok ths lands as from tims to timo tbo work should progress, and as ths 8tats thsrsby bscams authorised by the express terms ok tbo graut to sell them. This appears to havo boen the correct construction ok ths act, but by a sub ssqusnt act ok Congress, approved duno 2, 1864, amending ths act ok 1856, tho forms ok tho grant wsrs changed, aud numerous controversies arose between tbo companies and tho 8tato. Iho ostensible purposo of this additional act was to allow tho Davenport it Council Rlufls Railroad \"to modify or change the location of tho uncompleted portion ol its lino,\" to run through the town ok Nowton, daspor County, or as noarly as practicable to that point. Iho original grant had been made to the 8tate to aid in tho construction ok railroads within its limits and not to tho com panies, but Congross, in 1864, appears to havo boon utterly ignorant ok what had boon dono undor tho act ok 1856, or, is not, to havo utterly disregarded it. The 8tate had accepted the original gram. The 8eeretary ok ths Interior had already certified to tho 8tate all the lands intended to bo included in the grant within fifteen miles ok tbe lines ok the several railroads. It will bo remembered that 8sction 4, ok tho act ok May 15, 1856, specifies tbe manner ok salo ok these lands from time to tims as work on ths railroads should progress, and also provided that \" ik any ok said roads aro not completed within ten years, no /to\" t/he?- sals shall bs mado, and tho lands un\u00abo?ck s/,a?7 ,-evert to t/ts iXll'te^ H'tates.\" Having vested ths titls to thsss lands in trust, in ths 8tats ok Iowa, it is plain that until tho expiration ok tho ton yoars thoro could bo no reversion, and tho 8tate, not tho finited 8tates, mu^t control thom uutil tho grant should expire by limitation. Ihe Finited 8tates authorities could not rightfully roquiro tho 8ecretary of tho Interior to certify directly to the companies any portion of tho lands already certified to the 8tate. And yet Congross. by its aot of duno 2, 1864, provided that whenever ths Davenport it Council Fluffs Railroad Com pany should file in tho General land Office at Washington a map definitely showing such now location, the 8ecretary of tho Interior should oauso to bo cer tified and conveyed to said Company, from time to tims, as ths road progressed out of any ok tho lauds belonging to tho Finited 8tates, not sold, reserved, or"], [230, "216 HISTORY OF THR STATF OF IOWA. otherwise disposed of, or to which a prs-omption claim or right ok homestead had not attachod, and on which a bona Ms settlement and improvement had not been made under color ok titlo derived from tho Finited 8tates or from the 8tate ok Iowa, within six milos ok such newly located line, an amount ok land per mils squal to that originally authorised to bo granted to aid in tho construction ok said road by the act to which this was an amendment. Ihe term \"out ok any lands osionFl'nF to t/is tXli'teti Htatez, not sold, re served or otherwise disposed ok, otc,\" would seem to indicate that Congress did intend to grant lands already granted, but when it declared that the Company should havo an amount per milo e^uai to that originally \u00abut/io?-l\u00absci to os F/\"\u00abnteoI, it is plain that tho trainers ok tho bill were ignorant ok tho roal terms ok ths original grant, or thitt they designed that the finited 8tates should \u00abz\u00abms ths title it had already parted with two years before the lands oould revert to tho Finited 8tates under the original act, whicb was not repealed. A similar change was made in relation to tho Cedar Rapids it Missouri Railroad, and dictated tho conveyance of lands in a similar manner. like provision was made for tho Dubuque it 8ioux City Railroad, and ths Company was permitted to chango tho location ok its line between Fort Dodzs and 8ioux City, so as to secure the best route botweeu those paints ; hut this cdangs ok location was not to impair tds right to tho land granted in ths orig inal aet, nor did it change tbe location ok those lands. Ry the same act, the Mississippi it Missouri Railroad Company was author ised to transfer and assign all or any part of tho grant to any othor company or person, \" if, in tho opinion of said Company, tbo construction ok said railroad across tho 8tato ok Iowa would bo thereby soonor and moro satisfactorily com plotod; but such assignee should not in any case be released from tho liabilities and conditions accompanying this grant, nor acquiro perfect title in any other manner than tho samo would havo boou acquired by the original grantee.\" 8till further, the Rurlington it Missouri Rivor Railroad was not forgotten, and was, by ths sams act, empoworod to rocoivo an amount ok land per mils equal to that montionod in tho original aot, and ik that could not bo found within tho limits of six miles from tbs lins ok said road, tbon such selection might be made along such line within twenty miles thereof out of any public lands belonging to tho Finited 8tates, not sold, reserved or otherwise disposod of, or to which a pre-emption claim or right of homestead had not attached.

The germ ol tho lree public school system ol Iowa, which now ranks sec ond to none in ths Finited 8tates, was planted by tbe first settlers.

Nor is this to bs wondered at when it is remembered bumble log school houses were built almost as soon as tho log cabin ol ths earliest settlers wsrs occupied by their brave builders. In the lead mining regions ol tho 8tate, ths first to bo occupied by the white race, tbe hardy pioneers provided the means lor the education ol their ehildren even bslors thoy had comfortable dwellings lor their families. 8chool teachers were among ths first immigrants to Iowa.

Ferhaps in no singlo instanco has tho magnifioont progress ol the 8tate of Iowa boen moro marked and rapid than in her common school system and in ber school houses, which, long since, superseded the log cabins ok tho first settlers. lo day, tho school houses which everywhere dot tho broad and fertile prairies ok Iowa ars unsurpassed by thoso ok any other 8tate in tho great Finion.

Among tho first buildings erected at Durlington was a commodious log school douso in 1834, in which Mr. dohnson Fiorson taught the first school in tho Winter ol 1834-5. lho first school in Muscatins County was taught by Georgo Rumgardner, in tbe 8pring ol 1837, and in 1839, a log school houso was orsctod in Musea tino, which sorved lor a long timo lor school houso, church and public hall. lho first school in Davenport was taught in 1838. In Fairfield, Miss Clarissa 8awyer, dames F. Chambers and Mrs. Reed taught school in 1839. Whon tho sito ol Iowa City was selected as the capital ol tbo lorritory ol Iowa, in May, 1839, it was a porloct wilderness, lhe first sale ol lots took placo August 18, 1839, and bolero danuary 1, 1849, about twenty families bad settled within the limits ol tbo town ; and during tho samo yoar, Mr. desse Ferry opened a school in a small lramo building ho had erected, on what is now College street. lbs first settlement in Monroo County was mado in 1843, by Mr. dohn R.

About a yoar altor tho first cabiu was built at OsKaloosa, a log school houso was built, in which school was oponod by 8amusl W. Caldwoll in 1844. At Fort Des Moinos, now tho capital ol tho 8tato, ths first school was taught by lewis Whitton, ClorK ol ths District Court in ths Winter ol 1846-7, in ono ol ths rooms on \" Coon Row,\" built lor barracks. lho first school in Fottawattomio County was opensd by Gsorgs Grssn, a Mormon, at Council Foint, prior to 1849 ; and until about 1854, noarly, il not quits, all the teachers in that vicinity were Mormons. lhe first sohool in Docorah was taught in 1853, by l.

' Iowa lorritory was created duly 3, 1838. danuary 1, 1839, the Territorial logislaturo passed au act providing that \" thoro shall bs established a common school, or schools in each of tho countios in this Territory, which shall bo opon and lies lor svery class ol whito citisons botwssn ths agss ol fivo and twonty-ono yoars.\" lho second section ol tho act provided that \" tbo County Foard shall, lrom timo to timo, form suod districts in their respective counties whenever a petition may bo presented lor tho purposo by a majority ol the voters resident within suoh contemplated district.\" lhese districts were gov erned by boards ol trustees, usually ol throo persons ; each district was required"], [234, "220 HISTORY OF THE STATE OF IOWA. to maintain school at least three months in every year ; and later, laws were enacted providing lor county school taxes lor the payment ol toachors, and that whatever additional sum might bs required should bs assessed upon tho parents sending, in proportion to ths length of tims sont. When Iowa lorritory became a 8tate, in 1846, witd a population ol 199, 999, and with 29,999 scholars within its limits, about lour hundred school dis tricts had been organised. In 1859, there were 1,299, and in 1857, ths number bad increased to 3,265. In March, 1858, upon ths recommendation ol Hon. M. F.

An effort was made lor ssvoral years, lrom 1867 to 1872, to abolish tho sub district system. Mr. Xiss^ll, 8uperintendent, recommended, in his report ol danuary 1, 1872, and Governor Merrill forcibly endorsed his viows in his annual message. Rut the legislature ol that yoar provided lor tho formation ol inde pendent districts lrom tho sub-districts ol district townships. lho system ol graded schools was inaugurated in 1849 ; and new schools, in which moro than ono teacher is employed, aro universally graded. lho first official mention ol loaohers' Institutes in the educational records ol Iowa occurs in tho annual report ol Hon. lhomas FI. Renton, dr., mado December 2, 1859, who said, \" An institution ol this character was organised a lew years ago, composed ol tho toachors ol ths minsr.il regions ol Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa. An association ol teachers has, also, been formed in ths county of Henry, and an effort was made in October last to organise a regular institute in the county of donos.\" At that time \u2014 although tho beneficial influence ok these institutes was admitted, it was urged that the expenses ok attending them was greater than teachers with limited compensation wore able to bear. To obviate this objection, Mr. Renton recommended that \" the sum of K159 should bo appropriated annually kor three years, to bo drawn in install inents ok H59 tz^H by tbe 8uperintendent ok Fublic Instruction, and expended for thoso institutions.\" Ho proposed that three institutes should bs hsld annu ally at points to bo designated by the 8uperintendent. No legislation in this direction, however, was had until March, 1858, when an act was passed authorising the holding ok teachers' institutes for periods not less than six working days, whenever not less than thirty teachers should desire. lbs 8uperintendent was authorised to expend not exceeding H199 syr any one institute, to bo paid out by the County 8uperintendent as the institute might direct for teachers and lecturers, and ono thousand dollars was appropriated to defray the expenses of tbeso institutes. December 6, 1858, Mr. Fisher reported to tho Roard of Education that institutes had boen appointed in twenty counties within tho preceding six months, and more would have been, but tbe appropriation had been exhausted. lie Roard of Education at its first session, commencing December 6, 1858, enacted a code of school laws which retained the existing provisions for teachers' institutes. In March, 1869, tbe General Assembly amended tbe act of the Roard by appropriating \" a sum not exceeding fifty dollars annually for ono such institute, held as provided by law in each county.\""], [235, "221 HISTORY OF THR STATE OF IOWA. In 1865, Mr. Faville reported that \" the provision made by the 8tate for the benefit of teachers' institutes has never been so fully appreciated, both by tde peoplo and tdo teacders, as during tde last two years.\" Ry aet approved March. 19, 1874, Normal Institutes were established in each county, to bs hsld annually by tbs County 8upsrintsndent. lhis was regarded as a very decided step in advance by Mr. Abernethy, and in 1876 the 8ixteenth General Assembly established the first permanent 8tate Normal 8ohool at Cedar Falls, Rlack FiawK County, appropriating tho building and property ok the 8oldiors' Orphans' Homo at that place for that purposo. lhis school is now \" in tbe full tids of successful experiment.\" lhe public school system of Iowa is admirably organised, and if ths various officers who aro entrusted with the educational interosts ok tbo commonwealth are faitdkul and compotent, sdould and will constantly improve. \" ldo public schools aro supported by funds arising from several sources. lhe sixteenth section of ovory Congressional lownship was sot apart by tho General Government for school purposes, being ons-thirty-sixtb part of all tdo lands of tho 8tate. lbs minimum price of these lands was fixed at ono dollar and twenty-five cents per acre.

Ihe interest on these loans is apportioned by the 8tats ssmi-annually to ths ssvoral couutiss of tho 8tats, in pro portion to ths number of persons botween tho agos of five and twonty-ons yoars. Iho counties also lovy an annual tax for school purposes, which is apportioned to tho sovoral district townships in tho same way. A district tax is also levied for ths sams purpose. Ihe monoy arising from these several sources constitutes the support of tho public schools, and is stifficiont to enable every sub-district in tho 8tats to afford from six to nino months' school each year.\" The taxes levied for tho support of schools aro self-imposed.

The 8tate ol Iowa may woll bo proud ol her record during the War ol tho Rebellion, lrom 1861 to 1865. Iho lollowing briol but comprehensive sketch ol tho history sho made during that trying period is largely lrom tbe pen of Col. A. F. Wood, of Dubuque, the author of \" Tho History ok Iowa and the War,\" ono ok tho host works of tbo kind yet written. \"Whether in tbe promptitude of her .responses to the calls made on her by the General Government, in the courago and constancy ok her soldisry in ths field, or in tho wisdom and efficiency with which her civil administration was conducted during the trying period covered by ths War ok ths Rebellion, Iowa provod lisrselk tho pesr ok any loyal 8tate. Tho proclamation ok her Governor, responsivo to that ok tho Frosidont, calling for volunteers to compose her First Regiment, was issued ou tho fourth day after the fall of 8umter. At the end of only a singlo week, men enough wero reported to bo in quarters (mostly in tho vicinity of their own homes) to fill tho rogimont. Those, however, were hardly more than a tithe ok tho number who had been offered by company com man dors for acceptance under the Fresident's call. 8o urgent were these oilers that the Governor requested (ou tho 24th ok April) permission to organiss an additional rogimont. Whilo awaiting an answer to this request, he conditionally accepted a sufficient number ok companies to compose two additional rogimonts. In a short tims, ho was notified that both ok thoss would bo accepted. 8oon after tho completion of tho 8econd and Third Rogimonts (whieb wa\u00ab near the closo of May), tho Adjutant General ok tho 8tate reported that upward ok ono hundred and seventy companies had boon tendered to tho Governor to serve against tbs enemies ok the Finion. \" Much difficulty and considorablo delay oecured in fitting tbeso rogimonts for tho field. For tho First Infantry a comploto outfit (not uuiform) of clothiuo was extemporised \u2014 principally by the volunteered labor ok loyal womou in ths different towns \u2014 from material ok various colors and qualities, obtained within tho limits ok ths 8tats. Ths sains was dono in part for tho 8scond Infantrv. Meantime, an extra session ol tho General Assembly bad been called by the Governor, to conveno on the 15th ol May. With but littls delay, that body authorised a loan of K800,000, to meet the extraordinary expenses incurred and to bo incurred, by the Executive Department, in consequence ol the new omor goncy. A wealthy merchant ol tho 8tats (Ex-Govornor Morrill, then a resident ol McGregor) immediately took lrom tho Governor a contract to supply a com pleto outfit ol clothing lor tho throo rogimonts organised, agreeing to rocoive should tho Governor so elect, his pay therelor in 8tate bonds at par.

To provido for tho adequate defense ok her borders from ths ravages of both rebels in arms against the Government aud ok tho moro irrosistiblo foes from the Western plains, tbe Governor of ths 8tats was authorised to raise aud ec^tiit) two rogimonts ok infantry, a squadron of cavalry (not loss than fivo companies) and a battalion of artillery (not less than three oompauios.) Only cavalry were enlisted lor homo defense, however, \"but,\" says Col. Wood, \"iu times of special dangor, or when calls were mads by ths Finionists of Northern Missouri for assistance against their disloyal enemies, large numbers of militia on foot often turned out, and remained in the field until ths necessity for tboir sorvices had passed. \" Iho first ordsr for ths Iowa volunteers to movo to tho fiold was received on the 13th of dune. It was issued by Gen. lyon, then commanding the Finited 8tatos forces in Missouri. Ihe First and 8econd Infantry immediately embarked in steamboats, and movod to Hannibal. 8omo two wosks later, ths Third Infantry was ordered to tho same point. Ihoso throo, together with many other ok the earlier organised Iowa rogimonts, rendered their first field service in Missouri. Iho First Infantry formed a part ok tbs little army with which Gen. Fyon movod on 8pringfiold, and fought tho bloody battle of Wilson's Creek. It received unqualified praise for its gallant bearing on tho field. In the following month (8oAember), the Third Iowa, with but very slight support, fought with honor tho sanguinary engagement of Rlue Mills landing; and in November, ths 8evsnth Iowa, as a part of a force commanded by Gen. Grant, greatly distinguished itself in the battle of Relmont, whoro it pourod out its blood liko wator \u2014 losing more than half ol tho mon it took into action. \" Iho initial operations in which tbo battles referred to took place were sol lowod by the moro important movements lod by Gon.

In these and other movements, down to tho grand culminating campaign by which Vicksburg was"], [245, "231 HISTORV OF THF STATE OF IOWA. captured and the Confederacy permanently severed on ths lius of tho Mississippi Rivsr, Iowa troops took part in steadily increasing numbers. In the investment and siege ok Vicksburg, tho 8tato was rspresented by thirty regiments and two battoriss, in addition to which, eight regiments and ono battery were employed on the outposts ok tho besieging army. Ihe brilliancy ok their exploits on tho many fields where they served won for them the highest meed of praiso, both in military and civil circles. Multiplied were ths terms in which expression was givon to this sentiment, but these words of ono of ths journals of a neigh boring 8 tats, ''Iho Iowa troops havo bssn heroes among heroos,' embody 'tho spirit ok all. \" In tho votoran re-enlistments that distinguished the closing months ok 1863 abovo all other poriods in tho history ok ro-onlistments kor the national armies, tho Iowa throo years' men (who woro relatively moro numerous than thoso ok any other 8tate) were prompt to set the example ok volunteering kor another term ok equal lougtd, thereby adding many thousands to tho great army ok thoso who gavo this ronowod and practical assurance that ths causs ok ths Finion should not bo loft without dofsnders. \" In all the important movements ok 1864-65, by which tho Confederacy was penetrated in every quarter, and its military power finally overthrown, fho Iowa troops took part. Their drum-beat was heard on tho banks of ovory great river ok tho 8outh, from tho Fotomac to tho Rio Grando, and everywhere they rendered the same faithful and devotsd service, maintaining on all occasions tlioir wonted reputation for valor in tho field and endurance on tbe march. \" Two Iowa throe-year cavalry regiments were employed' during their wholo form ok service in the operations that were in progress from 1863 to 1866 against the hostils Indians of tho western plains. A portion of those men were among tho last of tho volunteer troops to do mustered out of service. The 8tats also supplied a considorablo numdor of men to ths navy, who took part in most ok tbo naval operations prosecuted against ths Confederate power on ths Atlantic and Gull coasts, and tho rivers of ths Wsst. \" lbs psoplo of Iowa woro sarly and constant workers in the sanitary field, and by their liberal gifts and personal efforts for ths bsnsfit of ths soldiery, placed their 8tats in the front rank ok those who became distinguished kor thM- exhibitions ok patriotic benevolence during ths period covered by the war. Agents appointed by tbo Governor woro stationed at points conveuiont kor ren- dering assistance to tho sick and needy soldiers ok tho 8tato, whilo othors were employed in visiting, from timo to tims, hospitals, camps and armies in tho fiold, and doing whatever the circumstances rendered possibls for tho health and comfort of such ok tho Iowa soldiery as might be found there. \" 8ome ol tho bonovolent peoplo ol tho 8tato early conceived the idea ol establishing a Homo lor such ol tho children ol deceased soldiers as might bs Islt in destitute circumstances. This idea first took lorm in 1863, and in tho following yoar a Dome was oponed at Farmington, Van Rureu Couutv, in \u00bb building loasod lor that purpose, and which soon bocame filled to its utmost capacity. Iho institution rocoived liberal donations lrom ths general public, and also lrom the soldiers in the field. In 1865, it became necessary to pro- vido increased accommodations lor tho large number ol children who woro seeking ths benefits ol its cars. This was dono by establishing a branch at Cedar Falls, in RlacK FlawK County, and by securing, during the same yoar, lor the use ol ths parsut Homo, Camp Xinsman near the City ol Davenport.

Iho number ol men who, under special enlistments, and as militia, took part at different times in tbo operations on ths exposed borders ol the 8tate, was probably as many as fivo thousaud. \"Iowa paid no bounty on account ol tho men she placed in the field. In some instances, toward tho close ol ths war, bounty to a comparatively smull amount was paid by cities and towns. On only ono occasion \u2014 that ol the call ol duly 18, 1864 \u2014 was a draft mado in Iowa. This did not occur on account of hor proper liability, as established by previous rulings of ths War Department, to supply men under that call, but grew out ol the great necessity that there existed lor raising men. The Government insisted on temporarily setting aside, in part, the former rule of settlemonts, and enforcing a draft in all cases whers subdistricts in any ol the 8tates should bo lound deficient in their supply of men. In no instance was Iowa, as a wholo, found to be indebted to ths General Government lor mon, on a settlement ol hor quota accounts.\" It is to bo said to the honor and credit ol Iowa that while many ol tho loyal 8tates, older and largor in population and wealth, incurred heavy 8tate debts lor tho purposo ol fulfilling tboir obligations to the General Government, Iowa. while she was foremost in duty, while she promptly discharged all her obligations to her sister 8tates and the Finion, lound herself at the class of tbo war without any material addition to her pecuniary liabilities incurred beforo ths war com menced.
